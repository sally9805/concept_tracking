 | " My tummy 's all right , K.K. , " Senator Fry said . " In fact , I was at the Guinean reception last night and ate like a horse . I 'm just wondering where Orrin is . " " Ah , yes , " said Krishna Khaleel with a little agreeing hiss . " Orrin is so busy since he arrived here . Does he think the United States depends on him alone ? " " He has been known to feel that way , " Senator Fry said with a little smile that the Indian Ambassador answered at once . " Even now , he feels that way ? With Harley in the White House and ? " " Even now , " Hal Fry agreed . " And perhaps with some reason . After all , it is n't as though Harley were the greatest President who ever ? " " No , indeed , " the Indian Ambassador said quickly . " But we like him , Hal . II We all like him . The world thinks highly of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but there is something very  --  solid about him . And of course Geneva was dramatic enough . " " Oh , yes , " Senator Fry said , thinking of that fantastic event which had astounded the earth and flabbergasted the universe . " Geneva was dramatic enough , all right . . . Is n't that Terrible Terry over there ? " " Where ? " Krishna Khaleel demanded , peering toward the bar . " I assume if it is he will be accompanied by the British Ambassador . The United Kingdom ca n't seem to leave him alone these days . " " I should hope not , " Hal Fry said dryly . " I hear Terry 's going to make quite a speech in the plenary session of the General Assembly Friday morning . " " He can be counted upon , " the Indian Ambassador said with equal dryness . " Why do you people give him such a play , anyway ? " the Senator from West Virginia inquired . " Just to embarrass the rest of us ? " " All the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know , Hal . He is one of the last gasps of colonialism . Or his situation is , anyway . " " ' All the Asian-African states , ' " Senator Fry mimicked . " As if you all agreed on anything for more than five minutes at a time . " " On some things , " the Indian Ambassador said . " On some things . We do agree on Terence Wolowo Ajkaje the M'Bulu of Mbuele . " " Terence Woe-loe-woe Ahdge-kah-gee the Mmmbooloo of Mmmbweelee , " the Senator from West Virginia said , rolling it out with considerable sarcasm . " Quite a title for a Harvard graduate . " " And the London School of Economics , " Krishna Khaleel said with a smile . " And Oxford . . . Now , " he said abruptly , " what is the S.-G. doing , talking to Felix Labaiya ? " Far down the room , under the great wooden slab above the bar that  | hears the carved map of the world , the Senator from West Virginia saw the tall figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lace and short , animated body of the Ambassador of Panama . " I do n't know , " he said . " Shall we go ask ? " " I 'm tempted , " the Indian Ambassador said , as two sheiks from Mauretania went billowing whitely by . " I wonder if it 's the draft resolution Guinea put in yesterday in the Fifth Committee ? Guinea , you know , wants to send a UN observer force to Gorotoland to see what the real situation is . " " Guinea always wants to meddle in everything , " Senator Fry said . Krishna Khaleel smiled broadly . " So do we , " he said . " And Ghana . And Mali . And Nigeria . And Indonesia . And Ceylon . And ? " " And the Soviet Union , " Hal Fry said . " And , lately , Panama . What 's the matter with Felix Labaiya , anyway ? " " The Ambassador of Belgium , please , " said the young lady at the phone desk . " L'Ambassadeur de Belgique , s'il @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more in that direction , " Krishna Khaleel said in the thoughtful tone of UN delegates who know very well which direction they mean . " But why do n't you ask his wife ? After all , he 's married to an American . North American , I should say . " I-Ial Fry shrugged . " No one gets anything out of Patsy Labaiya . She 's as much of a closemouthed crackpot as all the rest of her family . " " I hear , " the Indian Ambassador said , " that her brother has plans to run for a very important office next year and that Bob Leffingwell may resign from the Administration to help him . " " Governors of California have run for it before , " Senator Fry said , " but do n't believe all the gossip you hear . Here come Her Majesty 's distinguished Ambassador and Terry , so we 'll get a chance to explore all your most delicious suspicions in that sector . " " Hal , old boy , " Lord Claude Maudulayne said , peering at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know His Royal Highness the M'Bulu of Mbuele . " " I have n't had the pleasure , " Senator Fry said , shaking hands cordially . " Shall we go sit by the window ? There seem to be some seats empty over there , if we move fast . " " Right , " the British Ambassador said , grasping his tall companion by the arm and steering him toward the glass wall just in time to forestall three rosy Swedes and a small brown man from Madagascar who were heading for the only available chairs . " I ca n't stay too long , though . Have to go to the First Committee and help Orrin hold off the Soviets on the Panamanian resolution . "  | " Typical British understatement ! " the Indian Ambassador cried with a laugh . " Of course the Panamanian resolution is directed at the U.K. , not the U.S. Orrin will be helping you . " " K.K. , " Lord Maudulayne said , " you always see through me . Always . But of course , " he added more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States , too , you know . I think you can take the reference to unfair treatment of minority peoples ' as being  --  er  --  pointed . I 'm quite sure it is intended that way . " " I 'm quite sure it is , " Senator Fry said . " What do you make of all this , Your Highness ? " " I think you should call me Terry , " the M'Bulu said in the guttural voice of his people and the clipped accent of his educators ; and he conferred a dazzling smile upon Hal Fry , who returned it vigorously . " I think everyone should be friends , " he added with a gesture that was soon to become familiar to them  --  holding his hands out palms upward with a graceful , charming little shrug . " That is why I am here with His Lordship ? even though the United Kingdom and I are engaged in a rather  --  delicatediscussion at the moment . " " I expect him to give us jolly old what-for in plenary Friday morning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M'Bulu of Mbuele chuckled right back . " I expect I will . Gorotoland is quite important to me . It has been in my family since roughly the time William of Normandy acquired your island . Or so , " he said with a wry little smile that removed some of the sting , " tradition says . It is n't written down anywhere . They tell it on the drums . " " We have n't any desire to take it away from your family , you know , " Lord Maudulayne said mildly . " In fact , you can have your freedom . The WhittleHornsby Report promises that , and far be it from Her Majesty 's Govern ? " " Now , " Terrible Terry said with utter finality . " If you were only ready , " the British Ambassador said . " Now , " the M'Bulu said , and with a bland , faraway look he concentrated his gaze upon a heavily-laden barge struggling slowly up the East River in the hazy autumn sun and for the moment said no more . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but quite ferocious indignation . " The only place in the whole of Black Africa which is still unable to break free . Dahomey is free . Chad is free . Gabon is free . And what are Dahomey and Chad and Gabon ? Nothing but bare places in the sun ! " " Angola and Mozambique ? " Lord Maudulayne ventured to mention the Portuguese colonies , but the M'Bulu brushed them aside with an angry wave .  | " Their time will come , " he promised with great certainty , " and not far off . But our time is now . " " Two hundred high-school graduates in two million people , " Lord Maudulayne said in a bleak tone . " One hundred and two college-educated men and women . Thirty-three doctors . Twenty engineers . Forty-one trained administrators . " " Not a very good record for you , is it ? " Terrible Terry asked pleasantly , and the Indian Ambassador gave an appreciative little chuckle . His British colleague sighed . " We could have integrated you so well with the Rhodesias , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plans ready , but you would n't accept . " " No ! " the M'Bulu said with all the fierce vigor of his twenty-nine years , and for just a second Senator Fry had a vivid and uncomfortable vision of human sacrifice around a ritual fire in the thorn-tree country . " No ! " " Secretary Knox of the United States , " the young lady at the microphone said earnestly . " Secretary Knox of the United States , please call the Delegates ' Lounge ! " " Yes , Secretary Knox , " Hal Fry said in a humorous way that broke the tension , " please do , because I want to see you before I go to Fifth Committee . I want to know what to say to Guinea when they bring up that resolution . " " And the U.S.S.R. , " the M'Bulu said in a tone that dismissed other matters and came back to good nature . " Mr. Tashikov tells me they plan something very vigorous . We had an interesting talk yesterday on many things . " " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Senator Fry said . " Of course . " " Of course , " Lord Maudulayne agreed . " Beware . " " Yes , " said Krishna Khaleel quite unexpectedly , " do beware , Your Highness . Accept support where you can find it , when you need it  --  but without strings . They have no claim on you now . Do n't give them any . These people . They are not playing simple little games in this world or in this UN . They do not come to this house to offer generosities they do not expect to exact tribute for . They are in this house for what they can get . Do not be fooled by them . " " K.K. , " Senator Fry said , " how consistent can you be ? Every time it comes to an issue here you line up with them as dutifully as though ? " " I resent that , Hal ! " the Indian Ambassador said with real anger . " I resent that . India does what she does because she believes it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Soviet Union . It does not even always coincide with the Soviet Union . Often it is different from them . We take our own positions . We are not fools about them , Hal ! I resent that ! "  | " Well , it 's sometimes very hard to see , " Senator Fry remarked . " And very confusing for the rest of us . Anyway , here 's Orrin at last , and I guess maybe we should talk of other things . " " Your Secretary looks more friendly than I had expected , " the M'Bulu observed , " and not so formidable for one who engineered Geneva . " " He has a tart tongue and a tart reputation , " Hal Fry said , " but the latter 1 11 is somewhat exaggerated . And I think the President had quite a lot to do with Geneva . Where are you off to , Claude ? " illll " First Committee for me , old boy , " Lord Maudulayne said . " I 'll wait and go in with Orrin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you see Raoul Barre before I do , tell him I shall meet him for lunch at 1 : 5 in the Delegates ' Dining Room . Why do n't you join us ? Possibly the M'Bulu will do the same . " " I see , " Terrible Terry said with amusement , " that I am not to be let out Ipdh'I of sight . " " Oh , now ! " Lord Maudulayne said , and his youthful companion gave again his hands-out , palms-upward gesture . " I have a wicked sense of humor , " he confessed merrily . " That is where I got the nickname Terrible Terry . My sense of humor used to distress everyone in England so . " : ICI II it " Still does , old boy , " the British Ambassador said , and they all joined in his rueful laughter as the American Secretary of State , working his way slowly through the outstretched hands and dutifully smiling faces of a dozen different nationalities , approached them at last . " I 'm sorry to be late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I got tied up talking to LeGage Shelby at U.S. headquarters across the street . And you know how it is across the street . I should have come straight here , as you recommended . " " You 'll learn if you stay awhile , " Senator Fry said . " Do you know Terrible lil ? His Royal Highness the M'Bulu of Mbuele ? " " My pleasure , " Orrin Knox said . " I 've been looking forward to meeting you for some time , Your Highness . " " Call him Terry , " Hal Fry said . " Everybody does . Orrin , do you have any instructions for me for Fifth Committee ? " " No different than you 've had right along , " the Secretary said , " but come over here . Excuse us , gentlemen . " Staring out the great window at the gleaming river , outwardly placid , actually swift-racing g in the autumn light , he asked abruptly : " How are you feeling ? " " I 'm all right , " Hal Fry said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why ? " " You looked quite odd for a minute last night at the Guinean reception , "  | Orrin said . " A very strange expression . I did n't know whether you were going to faint or what . " " Was it that obvious ? " Senator Fry asked in some annoyance . " I do n't think anybody saw it but me . What was it ? " " Just my eyes , " Hal Fry said . " A little reddish tinge for a minute . It went right away . Just overtired , I think . It startled me , though , which is why I showed it , I guess . " " Well , take it easy , " Orrin Knox said . " That 's orders . " " You 're very thoughtful . I will , as much as one can around this place . " " I do n't want the acting chief delegate dropping by the wayside now that the permanent Ambassador is incapacitated too . " " How 's he doing ? " " So-so . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Hearts are occupational in the public business , I guess , " Senator Fly said with a sigh . " How 's yours ? " " I 'm too ornery to die , " Orrin Knox said , turning back to the others . " Everybody knows that . Well , gentlemen , I expect the committees are beginning , and we should probably all run along . Take care of the interests of the United States in Fifth Committee , K.K. I know we can count on you . " " M. Raoul Barre , s'il vous plait , " the young lady said politely to the enormous room , now emptying slowly as the delegates headed for committees . " M. l'Ambassadeur de France , s'il vous plait . " " Always joking , Orrin , " the Indian Ambassador said . " It is a side that has developed in you since your new responsibilities . " " Since Geneva , I 'd say , " Lord Maudulayne remarked . " Nothing like tasting the joys of defiance , eh , old chap ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We had no choice . " " Does it ever seem like a dream ? " the M'Bulu asked , and for a long moment the Secretary appraised him with a steady glance . Then he tossed off , " A bad one , " tersely , and started to turn away . " But I wanted to talk to you for a moment , " Terrible Terry said , holding out a restraining hand . " Very well , " Orrin Knox said , dropping onto a sofa . " I 'll talk . See you slater , Hal . Claude , do you want to stay  --  or is that forbidden , Your High-ness ? " " Why , " the M'Bulu said with a charming smile , " nothing would please me more . " He too sat on the sofa and arranged his brilliant robes . " Mr. Secretary , I want to visit your country and be entertained at the White House . I think it would enhance my cause . " " Well ! " Orrin Knox said . " There 's nothing bashful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "  | " And diminish ours , " Lord Maudulayne said , too surprised and annoyed to be polite about it . " Possibly , " Terrible Terry agreed placidly . " But I think it would be nice . " " Is this a formal request ? " the Secretary inquired in a thoughtful tone that showed he was giving it serious consideration . " It is , " the M'Bulu said with equal gravity . " Oh , I say , " Claude Maudulayne said . " Now , really ? " " You could always give a reception for me at the Embassy , " Terry said blandly , " prior to the White House dinner . " " Oh , dinner ? " Orrin Knox said . " Is that all you want ? Is n't there anything more we can do for you ? " " I think that will be sufficient , " the M'Bulu said with a jolly laugh . " What an extraordinary thing , " the Secretary said . " If I were still in the Senate , I 'd tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm at State , I have to be more diplomatic . Do you mind if I consult with the President ? He ' VI might have different ideas , you know . Its just possible he wo n't want to rearrange everything for a  --  a rather minor African prince . " " Now , " Terry said with a sudden anger in his enormous eyes , " you go too 1 I , , far , Mr. Secretary . Really too far . " i ' " That was just as though I were still in the Senate , " Orrin Knox said nonchalantly , waving to the Secretary-General , who had paused across the room to talk to two members of the Soviet delegation . " I do n't mean it , really . But ll ; it really , now ? " " You entertain distinguished foreign visitors all the time , " the M'Bulu pointed out in a reasonable tone . " Surely I 'm no different . " " Well , except as you 're still fighting your case in the UN and it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " A position of post-Geneva , " the M'Bulu said softly . " Perhaps it is more necessary now than it might once have been . " " You 're a very clever young man , " Orrin Knox said without guile . " I wonder what you really want on these shores ? " " I want only the freedom which is due my country , " Terrible Terry said . " I do n't think that 's so extraordinary . " pl " I wonder . . . I wonder . Where do you want to go in the United States ? " " I heard so much about South Carolina when I was at Harvard , but I never got a chance to go down there . I should like to go there now . " " I am not at all sure you would be welcome in South Carolina , " the Secretary remarked . Terrible Terry smiled . " I am prepared to chance it . " " I am afraid we could not permit it , " Orrin Knox said . The gorgeous figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How can you prevent it ? I 'm no Communist diplomat you can keep chained to New York or Washington . " Possibly the British can restrain you . " " They would n't dare ! " the M'Bulu said scornfully , and Lord Maudulayne sighed . " Right you are , " he said . " We would n't dare . Nor , my old friend from the Senate , would you . " " So , you see ? " Terrible Terry demanded in happy triumph . " It is all so simple , and we might as well all co-operate . " " When would you like to go ? " Orrin Knox asked . " The invitation is for tomorrow noon , " the M'Bulu said , and at his listeners ' looks of surprise he laughed again  --  in innocent merriment , as the Secretary remarked in the privacy of his own mind , in inno-cent merri-ment . " And what invitation is this ? " he asked . " The Jason Foundation is giving a luncheon for me in Charleston , " Terry said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of California , will introduce me . " " Patsy Jason Labaiya 's family fortune is behind that , " the Secretary informed Lord Maudulayne . " It does much good and causes some trouble , like all foundations . So Ted Jason will be there too ? I thought the California legislature was in special session . Why do n't you go out there instead ? Maybe you could address them . " " I have several invitations to be on television here that I have to keep , " the M'Bulu said proudly . " It all helps . " " I 'm sure it does . Well , I 'll talk to the President . How about letting him designate a member of Congress to go with you as his representative ? " " And my guard ? " Terry suggested with a smile . " Who  --  Senator Cooley ? I 'm sure that would guarantee me safe-conduct in South Carolina ! " " He might just surprise you and do it , " the Secretary said . " There are a few tricks left in old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hamilton , as a matter of fact . He 's one of our young Representatives , from California . A very fine one . And a Negro . " " I know him , " the M'Bulu said , and for just a second a contemplative and not too pleasant expression came into his eyes . " He visited my capital of Molobangwe last year for the House Foreign Affairs Committee . " " Did you like him ? " the Secretary asked . Terrible Terry 's expression changed to something indefinable . He shrugged . " He has a pretty wife . " He stood up briskly , his robes showering down about him in glittering cascade . " Very well , I 'll take old Cullee , then , if that 's what you want . And you will talk to the President . Maybe  | Thursday night , if he 's free . Then I can have the day Thursday for seeing people in Washington . " It takes time to arrange a White House dinner , " Orrin Knox said . " He can do it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Go down through layer after layer after layer and you still find something tenaciously and terribly childlike underneath . The M'Bulu smiled happily . " That way , I can still be back here in plenty of time for my speech Friday morning . " " Full of Praise for the United States , no doubt , " Knox suggested . The M'Bulu gave his charming palms-out gesture . " I am sure of it ! Your Excellency ? " he shook hands with the British Ambassador . " Mr. Secretary ? " he repeated with Orrin Knox . " I just want to say good morning to the S.G. before I drop in on the First Committee . I shall see you there , no doubt , discussing my important little country . " " See you there , Your Highness , " Orrin Knox agreed , and caught himself even as the M'Bulu did ? " Terry . " " Good cheer , " the glamorous visitor said . " Good cheer , both ! " " Mr. Fibay-Toku of Upper Volta , please , " said the young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Volta , please call the Delegates ' Lounge . " A moment later the Secretary and the Ambassador could see the M'Bulu on the other side of the enormous room , now almost deserted as the hour neared eleven and the UN 's committees prepared to convene . He had hailed the Secretary-General with an easy familiarity , and they were standing near the entrance where the races of mankind passed in and out : both tall , both stately , both handsome , both alert , the one clad in the glittering robes of his homeland , the other in a dark-blue business suit , subtly different , yet subtly alike . " What an extraordinary young man , " Orrin Knox remarked . " Trouble , " Claude Maudulayne remarked . " Trouble for us both . " " Why do n't you give him his little seat in the UN and his God-given right to make boring speeches to the General Assembly and get headlines in the New York Times ? That 's all they want , most of these petty little politicians who come out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " We have given a definite promise , at a definite time , under definite conditions , " the British Ambassador said doggedly . " It is only a year away , and even then they will be so poorly prepared it may mean chaos . Her Majesty 's Government will simply not turn loose an undiscipline mob if we can help it , until there is some chance of orderly transition . " " Here comes Terry , ready or no , " the Secretary said in a mocking tone . " For you , too , " Lord Maudulayne said . Then he added with a rare show  | of bitterness , " After all , it is post-Geneva . And we all know what that means . " " Yes , " Orrin Knox conceded , " we all do . " " Miss Mandrahani of India , please , " the young lady said . " Miss Mandrahani of the delegation of India , please call the Delegates ' Lounge . " Now it was autumn , the time of blowing leaves and warm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great feat of imagination or effort of will for the Secretary of State to return himself instantly to the terrible tensions of the bright spring days six months ago when he and his colleagues from the Senate had taken off for Geneva from Washington 's National Airport . As he matched the loping stride of Lord Maudulayne along the low , swooping corridors past the constantly recurring glassy vistas of the United Nations building to Conference Room 4 and the inevitable wrangle that awaited them there in First Committee , he could remember very well each detail of that strange , unlikely episode . It had brought a new emphasis to the world , produced a major and not yet clearly understood shift in the EastWest confrontation , given to the United States at once new stature and a new need for friends . Partly it had been the President 's doing , partly his . Neither they nor anyone else was quite sure , even now , exactly what had been wrought in those two fantastic , terror-haunted days when it seemed that it would take but a breath  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once upon the human race . Well : it had n't been , and for that , Orrin Knox thought grimly , the good Lord Himself was probably responsible , since His children were so unclear about how it happened . The good Lord and the instincts of nearly two centuries of freedom , which had stood them in good stead when the final chips , or what seemed to be the final chips , were down . There had been little conversation in the plane , he recalled , as it had hissed out across the empty wastes of the Atlantic . The President , much heartened by the enormous crowd that had come out to see them off with such loving fervor at the airport , had soon dropped off to sleep ? " One time when it can really be called the sleep of the just , " the Senate Majority Leader , Bob Munson of Michigan , had remarked to Orrin with an affectionate glance at the dozing Chief Executive  --  and the rest had occupied themselves with magazines , or brief , murmured conversations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minnesota , chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , had looked about nervously for a while , staring with  | deep intensity at the water until Senator Warren Strickland , the Senate Minority Leader , had finally asked , " Well , Tom , and what are the wild waves saying ? " At this inquiry , which seemed to disrupt some obscure train of thought that probably only he could follow , the senior Senator from Minnesota had peered up in his startled , owl-like way , mumbled something unintelligible , and finally buried his nose in an old copy of Life . ( ROBERT A. LEFFINGWELL , the caption on the cover portrait said ; WILL THE SENATE SAY YES ? The recent nominee for Secretary of State , photographed at a moment before he knew that the Senate would say NO , looked out upon the world with a confident and self-satisfied air . ) Shortly before the chief petty officers came in to start arranging things for lunch , Bob Munson had come over and sat down beside Orrin Knox , and for a time their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust , had ranged over events that neither of them in the rush of recent days had found time to discuss with one another : the long , bitter Senate battle over the Leffingwell nomination ; the devious yet ultimately goodhearted machinations of Senator Seab Cooley of South Carolina ; the contest between Orrin , then senior Senator from Illinois , and the late President ; the President 's death ; the sudden yet curiously reassuring ascension of Vice President Harley M. Hudson of Michigan to the Presidential chair ; and the dark tragedy , which had cost them so much in pain and sorrow and yet curiously given them much , too , in renewed strength and dedication , of Brigham Anderson of Utah , beginning to recede already into an endurable memory , the dark things forgotten and the kindly , decent , generous , and straightforward personality beginning to come into its own as they wanted to remember it and as he would have wanted them to remember it . Recalling that conversation , and recalling Brig , the Secretary of State was aware for a second that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every turning commingled the United Nations with all outdoors had become shadowed over . With an effort he shook off the profound depression that sometimes came over him when he thought of that shocking suicide , so necessary in some ways yet so unnecessary in others , and told himself that he must not think of things that would weaken or distract him now that he was about to enter First Committee and try to walk the delicate tightrope between loyalty to the British ally beside him and the savage onslaught he knew was coming from the Soviet Ambassador as he heaped ridicule and scorn upon the plan for gradual emancipation of Terrible Terry 's Gorotoland . The M'Bulu  --  that clever , willful , deviously determined young man . What game was he playing , and where did it fit on the chessboard of SovietAmerican relations ? There was a place for it , he was quite sure , but whether it would be on his side of the board or Vasily Tashikov 's , he did not know .  | But he was sure the M'Bulu knew , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes arise from an education at Oxford , the London School of Economics , and Harvard University , fused into one shrewd brain and fired with a fierce ambition . After their luncheon on the plane , he remembered as he paused in the long , red-carpeted corridor to greet the delegate from Cameroun , two ladies from Nicaragua , and the Ceylonese who was executive director of the Economic and Social Council , a certain practical animation had come upon the Geneva-bound party . With the meal they had put past things away and begun to think seriously about what lay ahead . Harley  --  even now , six months after his accession , Orrin still referred to the President by his given name in his thoughts and sometimes , embarrassingly , in face-to-face conversation  --  had moved , with the same surprising sure-footedness that had characterized all his actions in the first hectic week of his Administration , to put the problem in the perspective he deemed best for the country . " Orrin will probably tell me I 'm all wet , " he had begun with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best thing for us to do is keep calm and follow my lead .

" " But , Mr. President ? " Orrin had begun with some impatience . " Even though we too have now landed an expedition successfully on the moon , " the President continued calmly , " in the eyes of the world we go to Geneva , to some degree , under Soviet threat . They demanded that we go , and the Presi  --  my predecessor  --  had already accepted before our own expedition landed . So when I followed through on his acceptance , it appeared that we were yielding to threat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , " he added quietly , so that if they did not understand it , there would be no doubt , " that we were not . I was not . I thought it best to go letting them think that . I think it is still best to let them think that . " " I do n't quite see ? " Bob Munson began in a puzzled tone . " Surprise has its advantages , " the President said . " One lesson I learned from him , " he commented with a sudden chuckle , and for a moment they could see the predecessor he referred to , so strong , so dominant , so determined , so devoted to the country , and so full of tricks . " Would he ever be surprised to see me now ! " " He 's not the only one , " Tom August blurted out , and then corrected himself hastily . " That is , Mr. President  --  I mean ? " But the President led  | their laughter , and after a moment the Senator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first , but with a growing assurance .

" No more are we ; though , as I say , I think it 's just as well they continue to think there 's at least an outside chance . They 're awfully cocky after that broadcost from the moon and that big stout ultimatum to get to Geneva . And here we are , of course , getting to Geneva . So let them dream . I have an idea or two about it . " " My only worry , Mr. President , " Bob Munson said , " is whether we should have let them think , even for a minute , that we were giving in .

Not since Munich had the world waited in quite such fearful expectancy for an international event , and on the short-wave radio as they rode along they could hear the tongues of the nations raised in varying degrees of near hysteria to chronicle their journey . When they touched down briefly at Shannon , a silent throng had crowded to the gates and along the edges of the field , never stirring , never speaking , as they stepped out to take the air and look about them . Then as they lifted off a great cheer had arisen , touching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspapers had been deeply . put aboard , and the crisis was made even more emphatic and insistent for them . " WORLD ON BRINK OF DISASTER , " the London Daily Mail exclaimed . " WILL U.S. CAPITULATE ? " the News-Chronicle wanted to know . " GRAVE CONCERN , " the London Times admitted ; P.M. TO ADDRESS HOUSE . " " WAR ? " demanded the Express . And from their own I country , flown up from Paris in the day 's overseas editions , the New York Times carried an eight-column , three-line banner which began " WORLD AWAITS FATEFUL CONFERENCE , " while the New York Herald Tribune warned that " HUMANITY MAY FACE EXTINCTION IF PARLEY FAILS . " But here was humanity six months later still alive and kicking , and as he  | and the British Ambassador emerged from the elevator on the lower level and started over the tan and orange Ecuadorian carpets toward the group of delegates , guards , and press standing about the entrance to Conference Room 4 , the Secretary of State thought with an ironic conviction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition changed . Whether Geneva had made it less likely or more so that ultimate catastrophe would overtake the world , no one could say with certainty at the moment ; but that it had been absolutely imperative for the United States that the conference condude as it did , there was not now , nor had there been then , the slightest doubt . Of this , as they became airborne again and turned south for the Continent , they were instinctively aware , although they did not know at the moment just how the President intended to achieve it . He remained bafflingly exclusive about his thoughts , so much so that there were moments when his Senate colleagues came close to dressing him down as though he were still the kindly , rather bumbling , rather timorous , and uncertain Vice President they had known for the past seven years . Senator Munson , indeed , had at one moment started to exclaim , " For God 's sake , Harley ! " but had thought better of it and ended in a muffled expletive which did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This amused the President . " Now , Bob , " he said , " and all of you : take it easy . I 'm worried about this ? " his eyes darkened and a sudden look of disturbing sadness touched his lace for a moment ? " but suppose I were to show any outward signs of it , or even let myself really feel it inside ? Why , you 'd be scared to death . I remember how it is , it 's only been a week since I was on the other side of it . There comes a moment sooner or later in any real crisis when the most important thing in the world is to help the man in the White House stay on an even keel , because if he starts to crack , then everything starts to crack . You do n't want me to show concern , really ; the most absolutely necessary thing in the world for the United States right now is that I not show concern . So do n't push me into showing it , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to feel it , and then nobody could tell what might happen . " He looked at them one by one , an expression of absolute trust and candor that they found very touching . " Now , is n't that right ? " " Yes , Harley , " Bob Munson said after a moment , " that 's right . . . O.K. , 1 wo n't press . But I do think we should have a little more co-ordinated planning for what we 're going to do . Do n't you , Orrin ? " An amused glint came into his eyes . " After all , you 're always so busy about things , and you are Secretary of State . I 'm surprised you 're not raising hell on the subject . " " Well , " Orrin said with an answering smile , " I do assume that at some point along the way the President is going to take the Secretary of State  | into his confidence  --  and all of us , in fact . But you know Harley . He has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sure , " the President said . " Oh , sure , sure . I really think you boys ought to give Orrin a medal . He 's really showing great restraint for a man who thinks he ought to be where I am . And may well be , one of these days . " At this reference to his long-standing ambitions for the White House , which had been more customary from the late Chief Executive than Orrin expected them to be from his successor , the Secretary of State gave a rather rueful smile and shook his head . " No , I 've learned my lesson . I tried  --  and tried  --  and it did n't work out ? and then suddenly you appointed me and said you would n't run to succeed yourself next year  --  and now it does seem a possibility again  --  but I 've stopped worrying about it . You can only take so much of this he 's down , he 's up , he 's down , he 's up business , you know . If it happens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I can always go back to law , I suppose . " " You 've turned Knox into a philosopher , " Senator Munson said . " None of us thought it could be done . " If I know Orrin , " the President said , " this reformation will last until the next time he gets up a head of steam about something . Then watch out ! " . " Right now , " the Secretary said , " I 'm generating a head of steam about pl the Russians . You may have to hold me down in Geneva , Harl  --  Mr. President . I suppose it would be quite possible to say something there that would blow up the world . " " Oh , dear , " Tom August said . " I hope not . " " It would , " the President said quietly . " And of course you 're just joking now , Orrin . You would n't say anything irresponsible . " " No . But it is hard to avoid a little irritation now and then . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Warren Strickland remarked . 1 ' ' " We 're on the moon , too , " the President pointed out . " Our cards are just as good as theirs , when all is said and done , even though they 've succeeded in stampeding a lot of the rest of the world into thinking they 're miraculously ten thousand miles ahead . " Ill III " The crowd at Shannon did n't seem to think so , " Senator Strickland said , and the President nodded . " An enormous goodwill goes with us . Apparently they feel we mean well . " " Oh , yes , " Orrin Knox said , " they always feel we mean well . They can kick us around six and nine-tenths days of the week , but now and again , p on the remaining one-tenth of the seventh day , they will sometimes reluctantly admit that we mean well . " The President shrugged . " Well . That in itself is something . . . " He looked below , where the  | darkness held England , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " It looks to me , " Bob Munson said as they all peered out , " like bonfires . You do n't suppose , " he said half humorously , " they 're for us , do you ? " " I 'll have the radioman check , " the President said , reached for the interum , and gave the order . In a moment the copilot appeared in the doorway . " It is for us , sir ! We just checked the Air Ministry and the government has suggested that all along the route the people light fires for us . The Ministry says they 're doing it in France , too . We 're going to be lighted all the way in . " " Well , what do you know , " the President said softly . " So we come to Geneva on a path of light . . . Tell the pilot to turn on the landing lights and keep sweeping them down to the ground and up again at one-minute intervals from now on . That way they 'll know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And so they had proceeded , the little beacons flaring out of the darkness far below , the lights of the plane gravely responding as it sped on south over England , the Channel , and France : an exchange of messages , profoundly moving , which emphasized the fearful loneliness of their journey yet gave them much heartening for it . It would be a long time if ever , he realized as he and Claude Maudulayne entered First Committee and began to move toward their neighboring seats at the left of the inner horseshoe of blue-leather chairs , before any of them would forget the highway of light they had traveled down in the closing moments of their flight . At last the President had broken the silence . " I am always impressed with the enormous kindness of ordinary people . If I have that to support me , I can take my chances with the rest . " The feeling had been heightened when they landed at Cointrin Airport and , transferring to limousines provided by UN headquarters in Geneva , rode into the city along Route @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was out in force . American flags showed everywhere , people stood eight and ten deep along the way , and the cheers that began for them at the airport swelled steadily as they drove along . Here , too , was the emphasis on light , springing from some atavistic instinct in the human race , going back so far into ancient night that the mind could not follow even if the mind dared . Torches and flares danced everywhere , and as they turned into Rue de Lausanne and proceeded slowly past the League of Nations building along Lake Geneva to the villa hastily procured for them by the UN , a solid wall of flame kept them company on the left and threw the giant shadows of their progress out across the night-dark water . At the villa they were informed that the Russians would be expecting them at ro A.M. the next morning at the Palais des Nations . The President  | sent word back that they would be there at 3 P.M. , and after a little desultory small talk and a nightcap with several very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night and went off to bed . Off to bed and , in his own case , Orrin remembered , right off to sleep . He had been interested to find next morning that the others had done the same . Bob Munson explained it simply enough : " I do n't know whether it was the bonfires , or what , but suddenly last night I got the conviction that this is going to work out all right . If so many nice people think so highly of us , I how can we fail ? " They had all agreed ; but of course , the Secretary thought as he watched I 111111 the delegate of Ghana coming into First Committee with Vasily Tashikov , III the gorgeous M'Bulu , and a pallid little man from Hungary , the world did not run on such simple lines . It took more than the good wishes of nice people to carry on the affairs of humanity : it took guts and character and tenacity , and now and again a flair for the dramatic , which the President , again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ranging back now over their two meetings with the Soviets in Geneva , while First Committee filled up and gradually began to get under way , in IIII true UN fashion , half an hour late , Orrin Knox could see that Harley ' s strategy from the first had been exactly right for the situation that confronted him . His offhand dismissal of the Russian demand that the Americans appear at ro A.M. had of course given him the world 's headlines inII mediately , and he had never once let them slip away from him thereafter . He had held a press conference at r r and another at 2 P.M. At each , with III calm good nature , he had proceeded to reduce the Soviet position to one , essentially , of bad manners , and rather ridiculous bad manners at that . He had been confident but not boastful about the progress of the American moon landing , respectful but not overawed by the Russians ' parallel endeavor . The whole confrontation here in Geneva , he had implied , was rather unnecessary and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and general iIII deportment , he had managed to convey to the world a picture of a man not in the slightest hurried , harried , intimidated , or upset . It was no wonder that when they arrived in the gorgeous spring afternoon at the Palais des Nations amid the screaming sirens and sputtering exhausts of their motorcycle escort , the Soviets should have been awaiting them with obvious impatience and a steadily mounting anger . But when the Chairman of the Council of Ministers came down the steps to meet the car , advancing slowly in his dour , slab-sided , and characteristically suspicious way , the President shook hands with an almost absent-minded cordiality and then commented on the weather . " What a beautiful spring day , Mr. Chairman ! " he exclaimed . " I am so  | glad you offered me the opportunity to see Geneva for the first time , and in such a lovely season of the year . I am quite glad now that I decided to come . " At this Tashikov , with whom Orrin supposed he would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapped the gavel for First Committee to come to order , had leaned forward and muttered something harshly in the Chairman 's ear . The Chairman had nodded in the grimly thoughtful fashion familiar from a million photographs and television glimpses and snapped out , " Da , it is beautiful ! " and turning on his heel had trudged doggedly up the steps . The President waved to the cameras with a broad smile and wink that amused all but the Soviet photographers , shrugged elaborately , beckoned to his companions , and started , in a deliberately leisurely fashion , to follow . His host , if that was the proper designation , had disappeared down the hallway when the American party entered the building . With another shrug and a humorous look about , the President continued past the long line of guards standing at attention and the massed flags of the two nations intermingled with exact mathematical equality by the UN/Geneva protocol office , until he came to the heavily-guarded bronze doors of the Assembly I-Tall and there found some three hundred reporters clamoring without success to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . " I do n't know where the Chairman has gone to , " he said to Tashikov , who was waiting at the door , " but you can tell him that my predecessor accepted this invitation on the sole understanding that this meeting would be open to the press , radio , and television of the world . I agreed to honor his acceptance on the same understanding . Is the meeting to be open ? " " Mr. President , " the Soviet Ambassador began coldly , " my government felt it would save you embarrassment in the eyes of the world if ? " " Is it ! " the President snapped , and Tashikov snapped back , " It is not ! " " Very well , " the President said without a moment 's hesitation . " Come along , gentlemen . " And he had swung about and led them , startled but having the sense to conceal it , back to the entrance , back to the steps , back to the waiting limousines , and so , with a roar and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the dazzling blue lake in the gleaming bright sun and the warm whipping wind to the villa . There he collapsed into an enormous overstuffed chair with a little grunt of satisfaction and a happy smile . " Nov , " he said with what was for him a surprising use of profanity , " let 's see what the bastards make of that . " " My God , Mr. President , " Bob Munson had said , and not entirely joking either , " had n't you better check and see if Washington is still there ? "  | " Washington is still there , " the President had responded in the same vigorous vein . " Washington will be there a damned sight longer than these sons of bitches . Have a drink , everybody . I 'm perfectly happy , but you all look as though you might need it . " " Yes , " Orrin Knox agreed , " I think we do . " Now , as he put on his earphone for the simultaneous translation in First Committee and switched the dial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could remember with satisfaction Tashikov 's appearance when he came to the villa at 6 P.M. The Soviet Ambassador had been white-faced and quivering , both at the situation and at the Secretary 's insistence on meeting him in front of the press in the villa 's ballroom . Under the anger Orrin could sense an uneasy and growing uncertainty . It had not been alleviated , he knew , when he informed the Ambassador tersely that the President had given orders that he was not to be disturbed for the rest of the night . " I thought he was entertaining the Chairman at a state dinner at 9 P.M. , " Tashikov had said angrily . " And the Chairman will entertain him tomorrow night . That was the agreement . " " Agreements can be broken , " the Secretary had taken some satisfaction in pointing out , " as you have already proved this day . Anyway , I think it 's just as well to get away from this standard nonsense about how much everybody loves everybody at these international conferences . You did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would bring us here to destroy us . Well : you have n't ; nor will you . Now , state your business , and if it 's worthwhile , I 'll tell the President . That 's my function . " " We can not possibly agree to open the conference to the press ! " the Ambassador said . " We ca n't possibly agree to attend unless it is open , " the Secretary replied . " Tell the Chairman . Good night . " And taking a leaf from the President 's book , he turned on his heel and went back to the private quarters where the White House communications center had set up an enormous bank of transmitters and receivers , over which he could hear the frantic commentators of his own country telling the world how horribly dangerous the American delegation 's behavior was and how irresponsibly it jeopardized the world 's hopes for peace . Watching Tashikov now as he launched into another of his high-pitched tirades against the United States , translated word for word and smug inflection for smug inflection by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amusement the Ambassador 's three subsequent visits to the villa that night : at 8 P.m. , at r , and , finally , at I A.M. Each time their conversation had been roughly the same , and each time it seemed to be briefer ; and yet  | the Secretary of State had the growing conviction that all he had to do was stand firm and presently he would win out . At the last he had gestured to all the cameras , the reporters , and the television gear before which they were standing . " Do you know what you 're doing , Mr. Ambassador ? You 're making yourself utterly and completely absurd . " " Very well , " Tashikov had said with a black anger that sounded , at last , completely genuine , " if that is your attitude , your blood be on your own heads , Americans ! " But at 3 A.M. , after they had all gone to bed , a courier had come and awakened the Secretary : the Russians would meet them at the Palais des Nations at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Imperialist colonializers ... oppressing the just aspirations of the peoples for freedom . . . destroyers of human rights ... enemies of justice . .. " The idealistic phrases of the liberty-loving friends of Hungary , Poland , Rumania , Bulgaria , Czechoslovakia , Albania , East Germany , and the Baltic states came to him in violent precision over the earphone as he watched the Soviet Ambassador pounding and gesticulating across the curved horseshoe of seats in First Committee . He had heard it all so many times before  --  so infinitely many times . But never , he was sure , with quite the ominous and portentous contempt with which it had been hurled at the President and his companions by the Chairman of the Council of Ministers as he delivered his three-hour denunciation in Geneva . After one or two futile attempts to interrupt , the President had sat back with an expression both amused and bored while the torrent of invective flooded in upon them through the same UN earphones and apparatus of translation . In fact , it could have been the same translator : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a mimicry so perfect as to border , unconsciously or perhaps not , on parody . The gist of the first two and a half hours of it differed little from what had been coming out of Moscow ever since the Soviets began their calculated campaign of world imperialism at the end of the Second World War . " I do n't think they like us , " Bob Munson had confided at one point , leaning across to Orrin behind the President 's chair . " I 'm saddened , " the Secretary had replied with a cheerful amusement that caused an uneasy little ripple through the ranks of the Soviet delegation . In the final half hour , however , the Chairman , looking about with his angry scowl and customary hostile expression , had gotten down to business . It was not a pleasant prospect that he laid out before the world ; although it was , as Warren Strickland remarked later , no different from the prospect presented so often in the past by his late predecessor before that worthy 's abrupt and unexpected demise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentials and stripped of the grins , the proverbs , and the bouncy bangingabout . " Guspodin ! " he had begun , giving to that word , as versatile as the French alorsl , a fateful and somber inflection : " Gentlemen , attend me well . You have come here at the direction of the Government of the U.S.S.R. , after great and overpowering gains by the U.S.S.R. , to hear what the U.S.S.R. requires of your country in the interests of world peace . It is this : " You will at once abandon the imperialist military alliance known as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization , and will assist with all possible speed in the liquidation of the NATO armed forces . This to be accomplished not later than one month from today . " You will abandon all military and naval bases of whatever nature on the continents of Europe , Asia , Africa , South and North America , exclusive of the United States , retaining only those bases not more than ten miles from the shores of the continental United States . This to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You will terminate at once all missile and space exploration projects of the United States , transferring immediately to the U.S.S.R. control of all such projects and their personnel .

" You will reduce the Army of the United States to one hundred thousand officers and men , effective two months from today . " You will reduce the Navy of the United States to ten battleships , live destroyers , and thirty supporting vessels , with suitable complements . You will discharge all other naval personnel and transfer to the United Nations Security Council title and control of all other vessels presently in the United States Navy .

" You will immediately disband and destroy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Air Force of the United States and most particularly the Strategic Air Command . " You will abrogate at once all treaties of alliance , mutual assistance or defense , between the government of the United States and other govern 1i ments . " You will take immediate steps to make certain that persons friendly to the U.S.S.R. are brought into the Cabinet of the President and other high  | ofices of your government , and you will take steps also immediately to assure a friendly attitude toward the government of the U.S.S.R. on the part of the press , radio , television , and motion picture industries of the United States . " You will prepare to receive in Washington not later than one week from today commissioners of the U.S.S.R. , who will advise you on carrying out this agreement . " You will appoint immediately two representatives to sit with the representatives of the U.S.S.R. , the Afro-Asian States , the People 's Republics of Europe , the People 's Republics of the Caribbean and Latin America , and a representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this agreement . " He paused and looked up and down the long table , and only the whirring of the television cameras and the sounds of pencils racing over paper in the press areas along the walls broke the silence . His gaze came back to that of the President , who looked at him with impassive curiosity from directly across the table . He gave a sudden cough and an impatient , angry shake of his head . " Now , gentlemen , " he said , " these terms may at first glance seem harsh and difficult for you to accept . Be assured it is not the intention of the U.S.S.R. to be harsh but only to do what is obviously necessary to guarantee the peace of the world . Our sole interest lies in removing the causes of friction and of war . We have tried for many years without success to persuade the United States to abandon policies which could lead only to war . The United States has persisted in these policies even though it has been obvious to the world that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be disastrous for all mankind . " Now the time has come to change these false and wrongheaded policies . Soviet science has placed in our hands the means to do so . We would be betraying our responsibility to the human race if we did not exercise this new power to make the United States abandon its mad drive toward war and adopt policies desired by all the peace-loving peoples of the earth . That is our sole interest , gentlemen . We are here in the cause of peace . Do not , I beg of you , stand in the way of the world 's yearning for peace . " He paused , and this time it was the President who coughed , a perfunctory and rather disinterested little sound which he emphasized by smiling politely and saying , " Excuse me , " in a friendly voice . The Chairman frowned but went on . " You are asking yourselves , as the watching world may no doubt be asking , why should you yield to these Soviet cries for peace ? Why should the great United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world 's peace-loving peoples ? Are there not profits to be gained by con-  | tinuing to pursue a policy of war ? Is there not power to be gained by continuing to pursue a policy of war ? Gentlemen , do not believe it ! No , gentlemen , that day is vanished forever . To continue on such a course is to follow an empty dream , to get holes in your shoes chasing a swamp fog . " Why , gentlemen , do you think " ? and here a heavy sarcasm came into his voice ? " do you think there are only radio transmitters in the Soviet expedition to the moon ? Do you think that is all we sent up there ? Do you think it is just a contest in radio broadcasts that exists between our two countries ? No , gentlemen , we ? ( the translator hesitated and then produced ) ? tucked in ? we tucked in a little something else along with the bread and cheese to keep us healthy when we reached the moon . We did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broadcasts , but we wanted to be sure that we had some other argument available when we asked you to come here and accept guarantees for peace . " That argument is up there too , gentlemen . It needs only a signal from us and it will suddenly be down here on earth again , falling on Washington and New York and Chicago and St. Louis and Denver and San Francisco and all your other fine cities . That is our argument , gentlemen , and you must not stand in the way of it . And , gentlemen ! We can not necessarily be sure that these are the only cities it will hit if you force us to use it . It may also hit London and Paris and Rome and many other capitals in the former imperialist alliance ring of the United States . We should not like this to happen , but if you force us to use our argument , gentlemen , we might not be able to control it entirely . This would be a heavy responsibility for the United States to assume , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . " He glanced at the watching cameras . " The world is right there now , gentlemen . What do you have to say to it , yes or no ? " And with a gesture that did indeed bring suddenly into the room the watching presence of humanity around the globe  --  Americans in their pleasant homes , Russians in their dark cities and mud-daubed huts , English in their clubs , Malays in Singapore , a white-robed Nigerian in Lagos , some Indians in New Delhi , little excited groups in the sunny alleys of Rome , a sheepherder in New Zealand , businessmen in Rio , tribal chieftains huddled around a squeaky receiver in Jebel-el-Druz , vividly dressed Malagasys in Tananarive , a frightened group of tourists in Tahiti , and many and many a million more on that bright spring day  --  he folded his arms abruptly and sat back with an intent and listening scowl . A silence again fell on the room , broken as before only by the busy whirring of cameras and a little stir here and there among the press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President of the United States . " Mr. Chairman , " he began slowly , leaning forward to rest his elbows on  | the arms of his chair and look with a candid appraisal at his opponent , " I would like to think that I am in the presence of a sane man instead of a maniac , for if I am in the presence of a maniac , then this world , so beautiful in the spring , does not have much longer to live . " He paused , and there was an audible intake of breath around the room and , no doubt , around the earth . But he appeared not to notice and after a moment resumed in a curiously detached voice , as though he were addressing , not the Russians , but the world , as indeed he was . " I came here with my delegation , composed of old friends of mine from the Senate of the United States , thinking we would find serious and sober proposals for easing the tensions that afflict our poor common humanity . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian side . " Instead , " he said , and a new vigor came into his voice , " we are confronted with utter frivolity . Yes , gentlemen , with utter and complete frivolity . With the most irresponsible playing with the destinies of mankind . With something so monstrous it would under other conditions be considered a joke , though an evil and despicable one . " " Gospodin ? " the Chairman began angrily , but the President went on . " Evil and despicable ! " he said , with all the intensity of one coming from a small town in Michigan confronted suddenly with something dirty and unexpected in the middle of the living-room rug . " Evil and despicable ! How dare you , Mr. Chairman ? " " Gospodin ? " the Chairman said softly , but again the President brushed him aside . " We have heard here every dream of every Soviet leader since the end of World War II , boiled down to essence and presented with a straight face . Get out of this ! Get out of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world to Communism ! Forget your responsibilities to humankind and surrender to us ! All the dearest fantasies of the Kremlin have been rolled up in one and presented to us here complete with threats . Gospodin , " he said , giving the word an angry and sarcastic emphasis , " you attend me well , and I will give you the answer of the United States . " We will never accept your ridiculous proposals . We will never abandon our duty to the world . We will never betray our friends . We will never shirk our destiny or our responsibility . " And he concluded slowly , with a softness to match the Chairman 's own , " Never . Never . Never .. . " And so what will you do now ? Blow up the United States ? Destroy the globe ? Use upon humanity all those rockets which , as your predecessor was so fond of telling us before you disposed of him , you produce like sausage ? ' Gentlemen , there are two sausage factories in this world . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submarines with nuclear  | weapons beneath the seas of this world . There is everything in this world to destroy not only us but you as well . Gospodin , do you really think we will not use it ? And do you think you will gain anything thereby ? " Mr. Chairman , " he said , and at last he spoke directly to the man who scowled upon him from across the table , " do you not see what you have done by this threat of terror , not only this threat but all the others you have 11 , flung upon the world over the years ? You have made terror ridiculous . We Ill have so much terror at our fingertips , you and I , that there is no more terror . It no longer makes sense . It is absurd . " Blow us uPthen . And we will blow you up , then . And let us together blow up the world , then ! And that will be the end of humanity , then ! And what will that accomplish , can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be trusted with your great responsibilities . And I and my delegation , " he concluded quietly , " have nothing more to say or do here . If you wish to meet us in the United Nations to conduct negotiations with a decent respect for our mutual needs and the needs of humanity , we shall be there as always . Right now , " he said in four words that were so simple they dignified the moment better than oratory could , " we are going home . " And he rose slowly , and with a friendly nod to his countrymen , who also rose as in a daze and followed him , he walked with his sturdy , plodding gait down the long table past the cameras , past the guards , down the steps , into the limousine , and once again in screaming procession beside the blue lake i in the warm wind along the Rue de Lausanne to the villa in the bright spring sun . And the world did not collapse or the skies fall , Secretary Knox thought I 11 as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peroration and ; prepare to make way for a few words from Ghana prior to First Committee 's vote on the Panamanian resolution to have the General Assembly take up while it had seemed that they might and the globe had awaited with fearful trepidation what would happen next . " My God , Harley ! " Bob Munson had said when they were alone in the villa . " My God ! " " What else could I do ? " the President asked simply . " Really , what else could I do ? " And that was it , of course : there was nothing else . But as they rode back to Cointrin Airport that evening they were not , despite the outward appearance of calm they managed to muster , at all sure what lay in wait for them or for the world . No further word of any kind had come from the Russians , and anything from kidnaping to an immediate nuclear holocaust could have immediate independence for Terrible Terry 's Gorotoland . Yet for a little  | greeted them . This time the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little gestures and waves now and again , and it was not difficult to tell that they were again being wished well . But a terrible terror lay on the world . No one at all felt like demonstrations now . Presently the plane was airborne and the lovely city faded in the night . Fog and clouds came on soon after they lifted off , and Europe , the Channel , and England were hidden from them . It was just as well , for they did not really think that any bonfires were burning for them now . What they were going home to they did not know , either : whether there would be cities or a country left , although the President had received no word of anything unusual from Washington , and so it seemed likely things were all right , at least for the moment . Somewhere out from Ireland they broke above the clouds into a clear moonlit night . It was then that Tom August , peering up at earth 's companion floating serenely above , said suddenly , " Great God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far out between moon and earth , a tiny red rose blossomed in the endless depths of night  --  blossomed and grew infinitely brighter for a lovely , horrible minute filled with death and beauty and insane fear , and then began slowly to fade and fade , until at last it disappeared altogether . It was not repeated , and no one had ever been able to discover since whether it had been a shot that failed or simply a Soviet gesture for whatever propaganda value might accrue . It caused great headlines next day , but nobody knew . It was not repeated . And now here they were in First Committee , Soviet pressure unrelenting but the direct ultimatum , at least for the time being , laid aside . The world had gulped , shifted , adjusted , changed : nobody could say quite how much , or quite in what direction , whether toward or away from the men of Moscow , toward or away from those of Washington . The event , however , had brought an even greater tension to affairs , given many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The middle nations , the so-called neutrals , the youthful governments of Africa and the uncommitted states , had become even more important now . The contest had reverted to diplomacy and the battle had become even more vicious , using every means at hand . Including , Orrin Knox thought uneasily as he watched Senator Lafe Smith of Iowa come in across the room with a wave and a cheerful grin , the M'Bulu of Mbuele , that glittering young man who now moved gracefully to the podium and prepared , with a respectful yet confident air , to address the chair . Terrible Terry no doubt had some surprises up his sleeve for the West : all that education had n't been wasted on this particular product of the bush .  | Nor was it entirely clear why he should suddenly wish to visit South Caro gipl. ; lina . " Trouble for both of us , " the British Ambassador had said . It might well iiprove true , though perhaps it could be kept within bounds if Washington would co-operate . If the President would make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibly distasteful task , if Seab Cooley would not be too obstreperous and unmanageable , if ? Ten thousand ifs : such was the un III relenting nature of his new life as Secretary of State . He thought wistfully of the Senate , some two hundred miles to the south , CIilil and now at three minutes to noon preparing to convene , as the M'Bulu said politely , " Mr. Chairman , " and began . 3 A month later , after Terrible Terry has cut his swath through the United Nations , the United States , and the affairs of mankind ; after Felix Labaiya and his wife and her family have advanced their various ambitions in their various ways ; and after Cullee Hamilton and Harold Fry have , each in his own fashion , come to terms with the imperatives of personal need and the obligations of national integrity , the Majority Leader of the United States Senate will look back and wonder why he ever went along with Orrin 's idea in the first place . He will be able to understand it as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convinced of its wisdom : a tribute , he will suspect , to that universal state of confusion in which men everywhere , confronted by the necessity for making great decisions on great events , proceed along paths they can not anticipate toward conclusions they can not foresee . He will wonder then if the Secretary of State , impressed with the need for charting a careful diplomatic course in the wake of Geneva , may not have gone too far in his willingness to adapt himself to both the supposed attitudes of certain foreign states and the known prejudices of certain domestic critics , some of the latter more noted for their ability to raise hell than for their capacity to understand issues . Contemplating the results of it all , Senator Robert Munson of Michigan will be inclined to think that the first reactions in Washington were the right ones ; although , being aware with what imperfect knowledge and imperfect understanding the human race moves toward its mysterious and shrouded destiny , he will conclude honestly that , after all , the decisions taken may have been the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse than any others that might have been adopted .  | Right now , however , as he takes his position at the first desk , center aisle , of the Senate and prepares to bow his head to another of the Senate Chaplain 's maundering prayers , the senior Senator from Michigan is not concerned with such philosophic musings as this . Right now the M'Bulu of Mbuele and all the events and people about to be involved with him are among the least important items in the world of Bob Munson . He is aware that the United Nations is engaged in one more controversy about one more wouldbe African state , and he has followed its general outlines in the press . But he is much more concerned at the moment with the practical problems involved in bringing to conclusion the Senate 's debate on the foreign aid bill , and in pushing his balky and cantankerous colleagues toward an adjournment that is already , in late September , several weeks overdue . It has not been his idea , Senator Munson reflects with some impatience as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gavel , and the Rev. Carney Birch , Chaplain of the Senate , snuffles into another of his admonitory open letters to the Senate and the Lord , to let the Congressional session run on so long . Certainly he and the Speaker of the House would have liked to wind it up a month ago ; only the President has seemed to want it prolonged . Since his return from Geneva and the growing public praise and acclaim which have mounted steadily as the world has begun to realize that it will not be blown up because of his actions , Harley has been displaying what Senator Arly Richardson of Arkansas has referred to with his customary sarcasm as " a great urge to play President . " Leaving aside the fact that Harley of course is the President and definitely not playing at it , Arly 's casual cloakroom crack nonetheless does express a certain wry attitude on the part of the President 's former colleagues on Capitol Hill . The Executive whom Time magazine now hails respectfully as " the man the Soviets could n't scare , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pictures with a certain homespun strength that was hardly noticeable in his drawings when Harley first took office , is obviously enjoying his job . Not only that , he is using it to attempt to push through certain reforms which , like most other reforms of the human , haphazard , peculiar , and peculiarly successful American system , are long overdue . Possibly spurred on by Robert A. Leffingwell , who is receiving great press commendation as director of the President 's Commission on Administrative Reform , the President has already proposed a sweeping overhaul of the Defense Department and its allied missile and space programs , a streamlining of the Foreign Service and the overseas information activities of the government , and even , God save the mark , a new farm program . This last has already caused some revision in the Congressional estimates of what he will do next year when his party holds its national nominating conven-  | Jill lion . " I really believed he meant it when he said he would n't run again , " Senator Stanley Danta of Connecticut has just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that new farm bill I knew he 'd changed his mind . " Whether he has or not ( and , queried at his press conference a week ago , the President would only chuckle and say , " My , my , you boys must be hard up for news if you ca n't think of a better question than that " ) , and whether his burst of executive activity since returning from Geneva has been his idea or Bob Leffingwell 's , the fact remains that he has given Bob Munson a busy summer . The Majority Leader has been held to his duties as rigorously as he ever was during the tenure of the President 's predecessor . He has not complained about this , for , after all , it is his job , and it has also given his wife Dolly a chance to hold at least four extra garden parties at " Vagaries , " that great white house in Rock Creek Park , that she would n't have held if they had returned to Michigan earlier in the summer . But the instinct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them as Majority Leader , tells him that the time has come to get the Congress out of Washington and give its members a chance to rest up from one another . There comes a point , as Bob Munson is well aware , when Senators and Representatives have been together long enough and it is much better for the country if they can just go away , return home or travel or whatever , and In system resting s forget the problems of legislating for a while . I a sY subtly but inescapably upon the delicate balances of human likes and dis likes , familiarity does not necessarily breed contempt but it does breed an eventual irascibility which , toward session 's end , makes the functionings of American democracy rather more subject to personal pitfalls that they should ideally be . A fast windup to the aid debate  --  about two more days , Bob Munson estimates  --  an opportunity for a few last-minute speeches and dramatics by those Senators and Representatives who always have to have the last word for the sake of the political record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then  --  home . 11 , fu pi So thinks Robert M. Munson as Senator Tom August of Minnesota rises in the Senate to make his concluding speech on the aid bill and at the United Nations the M'Bulu of Mbuele begins to set in train the series of 11 events that will add another ten days to the session and bring to the UN and to both houses of Congress one of the most violent and embittered controversies of recent years . Unaware of these thoughts of adjournment passing through the mind of the Majority Leader , but fully in accord with their general import , the President Pro Tempore of the Senate is also anxious to get away . Seabright  | n . Cooley of South Carolina is just turned seventy-six  --  his colleagues spent all day yesterday trying to outdo one another in paying him tribute , except for Fred Van Ackerman of Wyoming , who deliberately stayed away with the sour comment to the press that he " was n't interested in soft-soaping srnility " ? and he fully apprehends that he had best get on home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he wishes to retain his gradually slipping hold upon it . The basic sources of his political power are Is ancient as himself , and many of them , indeed , are gone . A great name and a great reputation , great battles in the cause of Carolina and the South , have carried him through election after election ; but he is conscious now that new generations , new interests , new industries , and new money in the state are threatening his position as never before . " Seab wo n't leave the Senate until they carry him out on a stretcher , " Senator John DeWilton of Vermont remarked the other day . The old man knows with a lively awareness that he can be carried out just as effectively on a ballot box . New leaders walk the streets of Barnwell and new voices exchange the softly accented passwords of power in the moss-hung gardens of Charleston . Seab Cooley still commands great respect in his native state , but his instinct is not playing him false : there are whispers everywhere , an urge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasingly articulate , that South Carolina should have a younger and more vigorous spokesman in the Senate . " Younger and more vigorous , my God ! " his junior colleague , H. Harper Graham , comments to his fellow Senator . " Could anybody be more vigorous than Seab ? " But Harper Graham knows the talk , too , and Seab Cooley has good reason to believe that among those who would not be at all averse to seeing him defeated is Harper Graham himself , melancholy , dark-visaged , filled with ambition and temper almost as great as his own , burning like a dark flame in the Senate . He would not put it past Harper at all to actively seek his political downfall , Seab concludes , and the thought brings an ominous scowl to his face for a moment as he sees his colleague entering at the back of the big brown chamber . Then the look passes almost as it comes and is replaced by the sleepy , self-satisfied expression his fellow Senators know all too well . " What 's that old scallywag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murmurs to Blair Sykes of Texas as they enter the Senate together , and they speculate for an idle and amused moment that he is probably dreaming up some way to get Harper Graham : so well-known to the Senate is the nature of the bond that unites the senior and junior Senators from South Carolina . Actually , as is so often the case with Seab , the somnolent look conceals a mind at work on much more far-ranging matters than merely how to remove  | the threat of a bothersome colleague . " Getting Harper " is part of it , but his entire political problem is what engages him now , and the self-satisfied ex pression is really due to one of those flashes of intuition  --  or inspiration ? " or hashish , or whatever it is , " as Senator John Winthrop of Massachusetts one , ? put it  --  which occasionally show the senior Senator from South Carolina how to work his way out of difficult situations . It is not even , in this case , anything particularly specific , nor is it as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall just now ; it is just that Seab is reminded that on one issue , at least , neither Harper Graham nor any other successful politician in South Carolina can afford to take a position different from his . The man he sees is Cullee Hamilton , the young colored Congressman from California , but the thought Cullee immediately inspire , in the mind of Seab Cooley is not one that directly concerns him ; it is simply a generalized reaction , prompted by his presence , going back into the Nara past of a troubled region , stirred by emotions as new as tomorrow 's headlines , as old as the tears of time . It is not an especially original thought , but in ; l political sense it works ; and contrary to much violently expressed northern opinion , which conveniently forgets such areas as Chicago , Detroit , and Harlem , it does not work simply because politicians both white and black make use of it for their own selfish purposes . It works because the overwhelm ing majority of his fellow southerners , like Seab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by tradition , and by belief . This poses many deeply tragic problems , but the Senator and his fellow citizens can no more change on that particular subject than they could fly , unassisted , to the stars . By the same token , neither can Cullee Hamilton , as he stands at thi center door of the Senate chamber looking about for California 's junior Senator , the dashing and slighdy overdapper Raymond Robert Smith . There is a bill involving a proposed water viaduct in the San Fernando Valley which is on the Senate calendar awaiting action , and Cullee , aware that this is important to a number of constituents in his sprawling district just north of Los Angeles , wants Ray Smith 's help in persuading Bob Munson to pass it through the Senate by unanimous consent in what everybody believes to be these closing hours of the Congressional session . Cullee already has the Speaker 's promise to pass it through the House tomorrow  --  the Speaker has always been fond of him , personally as well as politically , and Cullee has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his first term five years ago  --  but the Senate Majority Leader is another matter . He has rather more on his mind than the Speaker does at the moment , the Senate being customarily more cluttered up with last-minute odds and ends than the House each year when adjournment approaches , and it will take a little extra assistance to get Cullee 's bill approved .  | Not that he anticipates any great difficulty , but it is a matter of timing and that takes care . In this Ray Smith , for all that he is something of a laughingcc to his colleagues in their cloakroom conversations , can be of real asdistance ; particularly since those San Fernando Valley constituents are vitally haportant to him , too . Ray is up for re-election next year , and he is as sharply conscious of his constituency as Seab Cooley is of his . The fact that be too is in rather shaky condition may provide the extra spur to successful action on Cullee Hamilton 's bill . An extra spur to Cullee , too , Cullee thinks wryly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of git-up-and-go as she constantly tells him he ought to be . The thought of his wife , though it appears to be a circuitous and indirect way to approach it , and though they would both be surprised at the parallel and for the moment unable to see it , brings him to the very point that is just ing through the clever old mind of the President Pro Tempore of the mate as their eyes meet for a brief moment across the crowded chamber . He and Seab Cooley do not really know one another , having had only one brief and uncomfortable talk on carefully innocuous matters when Cullee Oestified at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing three years ago , but there h a certain instinctive understanding between them ; " perhaps , " as Cullee old himself dryly at the time , " because we 're both Southerners . " Possibly for this reason it occurs to each of them in this fleeting instant now that the other may be thinking of the subject of race . Both are right , though there is a shade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in terms of his problem in South Carolina , Cullee , much more basically , in terms of his wife . " Why do n't you run against fancy-nancy Smith for the Senate next year ? " she keeps asking in her taunting way . " Because you 're afraid a nigger ca n't make it , even in California ? " And when he winces at the expression she laughs and says it again three times . " I know you do n't like that word , my or little Cullee , " she tells him in mock-soothing tones . " That 's a bad word us enlightened people do n't use . But it 's true , is n't it , nigger , nigger , nigger ? " It is all he can do at such moments , Cullee admits to himself , to keep from slapping her straight across the face ; except that it is , as the M'Bulu of Mbuele has already indicated to the Secretary of State , a beautiful face , and it happens to belong to a girl with whom the young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fundamental he ca n't help himself . So his only response is a tired sigh and the comment , " Why do you say things like that , Sue-Dan ? You know it only bothers me , and what does it gain for you ? Do you like to bother me ? Have n't you got better games to play than that ? " But her response , as so often , is an apparently instant loss of interest . " You sigh an awful lot , lately , " she says , and with another little laugh she  | u the cat and a ma g sinks into a chair , and seemingly picks becomes lost to the world as she studies the printed page and croons soft endear ments to the cat . Thinking of such scenes , which are becoming increasingly frequent of late , the Congressman sighs again and gives an unconscious , instinctive jerk * Thus his thoughts again parallel Scab Cooley 's , and now almost identically . There is the same commingling of passionate belief , personal ambition , and practical politics ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man reared in a much different age , is able to stand back for a second and think to himself with an ironic and troubled amazement ho fantastic this America is , which lets one man seek office on one basis in one state and another man seek office on almost the diametrically opposite basis in another state . How broad this umbrella , which covers so many children , he thinks ; and underneath the joshing , uncomfortable conversation he is attempting to carry on with Senator Smith a deeper melancholy comes as he adds to himself : and will they ever rest together in harmony and peace , or will they always betray the ultimate reality of brotherhood and love that is the great final promise of the American dream ? But now , he chides himself , you 're talking like an editorial writer , and dir the whole thing is a lot more basic than that . The whole thing at the moment , in fact , is as basic as Sue-Dan Hamilton and what she thinks when she goes 1 to bed with Cullee Hamilton ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning to become obvious to one participant , at least , that the other does n't think too much of it . Certainly not as much as she used to in the first wild months of a union that seemed at the time so inevitable it could n't be stopped . Now he is beginning to find it possible to think that under certain conditions it could be stopped ; and the thought terrifies him , for what would blc be like without little old Sue-Dan ? But even here a basic , ironic honesty dill intrudes . You 'd get along , boy , his mind tells him ; you 'd get along . But bls body adds instantly , it would n't be the same . Oh , no , indeedy . It would n't be the same . At once there leaps into his mind  --  by now Ray Smith is really quite worried that the Congressman does intend to run against him , because he seems so absent-minded and unresponsive to all of Ray 's sallies and there surely can be only one explanation for that : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is n't able to concentrate on small talk  --  a picture of hot , dusty Molobangwe , capital of Gorotoland , lying in the blazing sun of distant Africa . He recalls the mud-and-wattle huts , the cattle and chickens in the dreets , the guttural , rapid , curiously clicking sound of Terrible Terry 's native longue , and in the rambling , ramshackle European structure , left over from an early ill-fated Christian mission , which now serves as the royal palace , a peculiar conversation with his elusive and half-naked host . The talk appeared to center around politics and the M'Bulu 's impatient and uneasy relationship with the British , but underneath it all Cullee had the impression that It concerned Sue-Dan . They had been in Molobangwe for a week at the request of the House Foreign Affairs Committee , and the visit had proved , so far , quite disappointing . " Why do n't you run along over there and see what 's up with that boy ? " Representative J. B. ( " Jawbone " ) Swarthman of South Carolina , chairman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Mebbe he 'll let you in on things he would n't tell the rest of us . " It was indicative of the working relationships in the Congress that neither Cullee nor Jawbone made any point of this practical reference to his color . Jawbone 's assumption , however , had been false , and this had been very disturbing . In Africa he soon began to feel that he was being received , not as e fellow Negro , but as a prying and probably hostile American . Despite his preliminary reading , he had been a little too goodhearted to expect this , and to his first visit to Africa was proving something of a shock . The conversation with Terry had served to increase this unhappy realization that in e continent of tribes he was regarded as the representative of just another one , and that probably inimical . The whole thing was so foreign to his Idealism about his own background , both racial and national , and his exhilaration at the great African surge to independence that was contemporane-  | ous with his college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haviN considerable difficulty accepting it . Consequently he did not pay too much attention to the M'Bulu 's rambling , if charming , discourse . Except that , at the end of it , he had gathered enough to be able to report later to the coat mittee in Washington that there was probably real trouble coming with the British ; and to carry away in the back of his mind the feeling that Teren ( r Ajkaje , given half a chance , would love to appropriate his wife . Whether Sue-Dan fully understood this he never knew directly , excel ) t as he was male enough to know when his female was desired by anodic male . He did realize that she was conscious of it to some extent , and pc haps bothered by it a little . He preferred to think that she had not en couraged it , and indeed there was little opportunity during their long , jolt ing rides through the back country in Terry 's old American jeep that had come down to Gorotoland through the mysterious channels of jungle and desert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . fl wife had been circumspect and noncommittal in the presence of the M'Bult who alternated between showing off his gorgeous robes and appearing stripped to a breechclout with his magnificent torso rippling like moltea ebony in the sun . Sue-Dan had professed to be unimpressed by all this , and had even remarked sardonically at one point , " For a man with as man pretty clothes as you 've got , Terry , you sure do like to undress . " Terry had given her his charming smile and exploded into delighted laughter . Aftci that , save for his final talk alone with the Congressman when they had both sat around half-naked drinking native wine in the steaming hot room that had once resounded to " Rock of Ages " thumped out on a pump organ , the M'Bulu had been ceremoniously and fully clothed . And now , Cullee thinks uneasily , Terry is at the United Nations and his argument with the British is front-page news , and sooner or later their paths will probably cross again . In fact , he is almost sure they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggestion that he " trot along down to that Jason party for the Emm-booloo in Charleston , " he is sure Terre wo n't miss the chance to come through Washington on his way back t New York and create as many headlines as possible for himself in the pros ess . And he , as the most popular , well-liked , and respected Negro in Congress , will indubitably be expected to be on hand at some point along the line . He decides , as he stands there by the Senate door responding with a tenth of his mind and attention to the nervous chatter of Senator Smith , that both he and Sue-Dan will stay out of it as much as possible . Patsy Labaiya and her family can whoop it up for old Terry as much as they like , but he , Cullee Hamilton , will do only the minimum that he absolutely has  | M and Terry can be a white man 's pet nigger if he is willing to lend himself to the Jasons ' patronizing ways , but he , Cullee Hamilton , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will be damned if he aal11 do the same . And he is also not disposed , given the present uncertain we of his marital situation , to encourage any stray sparks in igniting any *. y dynamite that may be lying around . He frowns , driving Ray Smith almost frantic , and after an absent-minded wression of thanks for Ray 's help on the San Fernando Valley viaduct , beets Seab Cooley 's eyes once more , gives a polite nod which is politely reWed , goes out the swinging doors of the Senate , and starts back down the bag , dim marble corridor , crowded with tourists who think he is probably a rerk , to the House . At this final exchange of glances , five charming ladies whose presence in the Family Gallery is unnoted by the two participants exchange glances of their own and , with them , amused smiles and a significant nod or two . Beth Knox , wife of the Secretary of State , has come to the Hill to have lunch with Dolly Munson , wife of the Majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floors down they have , just a few moments before , run into Kitty Maudulayne , wife of the British Ambassador ; Celestine Barre , wife of the French Ambassador ; and Patsy Labaiya , wife of the Ambassador of Panama , dressed as always in one of her bright , garish dresses and bright , garish hats . Since no one of any prominence can be seen in Washington with anyone else of any prominence without half a dozen people immediately speculating on the significance of it all , Beth and Dolly have both been instantly . struck by this odd conjunction of Britain , France , and Panama . Both have perceived some of its possible implications in view of recent developments at the UN , and it has taken only the slightest and most elusive pf feminine communications to produce a unanimous and hearty invitation p join the luncheon party . This has been promptly accepted by Kitty , who loves politics and gossip ; by Celestine , who has approved with her gravely dent smile ; and by Patsy , who interrupts her own rush of conversation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd be simply DELIGHTED , " and then goes pn talking about her own opinion that the recent and surprising marriage of that perennial prowler about town , Senator Lafe Smith of Iowa , may already be on the verge of breaking up . It has been her DISTINCT impression , patsy informs her companions , two passing newspapermen , a Capitol cop , and a group of tourists from Nebraska , that ALL IS NOT WELL in that household . Why , do THEY know that at Dolly 's last garden party at " Varies , " Lafe and little Irene were seen by Justice Tommy Davis of the upreme Court VIOLENTLY arguing behind one of the rhododendrons , and now that Lafe is up there at the United Nations , Patsy 's husband , HER  | husband , Felix , says it 's common talk that Lafe is ? But here the Senator . ' private elevator arrives and swallows them up , leaving behind two disc 1 , pointed newspapermen , one grinning cop , and six puzzled but thorough I intrigued tourists from Nebraska . Now in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beth , even Pate Labaiya has to shut up , they have dutifully stood for Carney Birch 's pray ( , and then settled down to watch the Senate for a little while before goin ; , back down for their I2:3o luncheon reservation in the Senators ' Dinh , : Room . Beth says she ca n't stay away from the Senate even though Orrin is .0 State , now ? " it 's always been home to us , and I guess it will always be " ? and now that Dolly has finally landed Bob Munson after long and diligent effort she is finding that she , too , is drawn constantly to the best show in town . The best , and , with the House , the most important , in the opinion of ti ? Congressional wives . The ambassadorial , knowing that here in these chain hers United States foreign policies are implemented and American money i approved for distribution abroad , are inclined to agree . While Tom August drones on about the aid bill , interrupted occasional I by heckling questions from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five busy minds of five busy ladies click away like efficient little machines . Beth Knox , thinking over the telephone call that come faithfully from Orrin every day that he is away from her , recalls that last night he expressed a genuine worry about the latest developments , 11 the UN . The M'Bulu of Mbuele is vividly present in Beth 's mind , for Orri ? has told her without embroidery exactly the problems posed by that shrewd young figure : the possibility that the United States , though it will do its beat to seek a compromise , may yet have to break with Britain on the issue ; the possibility that France , still courting the favor of the young African state , she released to independence , may also find herself forced to certain im peratives of national interest ; the possibility , not yet supported by real prool but always present , that the Soviets may seek and in Gorotoland possibly find one more African foothold ; and the Secretary 's additional uneasy feeling that " this boy is a hell-raiser and I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that , Beth 's own feeling of incompleteness when Orrin is away and she has a good deal to contemplate as Tom August rambles along ; added also the fact that just before she left the big comfortable house in Sprint Valley for the Hill she received another phone call , this one from Springfield , Illinois . Her son Hal and her daughter-in-law , Senator Stanley Danta 's daughter Crystal , had burbled over with the news that the Knoxes would presently be grandparents . This too , understandably , gives her much to think about . For Dolly Munson , reflecting her husband 's concern with getting the  | ate session concluded , the problems are also of a domestic , though someghat less emotional , nature : whether she should have one last quick cocktail ty and buffet at " Vagaries " on Saturday night , or whether Congress will ve left town by then so that everyone of any importance will be gone ? ? tether she should tell the advance crew of servants to leave for Michigan ? open the house in Grosse Pointe next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week and just enjoy Washington and the Valley of Virginia in the beautiful fall weather without having to worry about the mate , Congress , government , social obligations , or anything else  --  whether k might not even be best for Bob to take him away altogether , arrange ? quick reservation on Cunard to Europe , and do their relaxing in London and Rome . Being married to the Majority Leader has brought with many subtle responsibilities Dolly never really found out about in her first happy marriage . The basic problem of how to take care of a man , which Seth knew instinctively on the day she first met Orrin in college , is only now being fully understood by Dolly . Kitty Maudulayne , who , like Beth , never doubted from the moment she hst saw Claude come riding over the green meadows and stone fences Crale that this was what life had planned for her , is also concerned to One extent with domestic matters and the possibility of a brief vacation . ? It being Kitty , loving politics , and very thoroughly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power in a world of aggressively advancing forces , she is also vitally concerned with matters at the UN . they come sharply into focus as she watches the handsome young Congressman from California nod briefly to Senator Cooley and leave the chamber . ' My dear , " Patsy Labaiya whispers loudly behind her hand , " some of them bok like BLACK GREEK GODS ! " Kitty responds with a brightly absentminded smile and , as she does so , catches the thoughtful eye of Celestine jarre . She knows at once that the wife of the French Ambassador is also *minded of color , and so of Africa , and so of Gorotoland , and of Terry , and d the UN , where events may soon take a turning that could conceivably bring to an end an association possessed of a warmth notably pleasant and notably close in the annals of the Washington diplomatic corps . This , Kitty thinks with a real regret , will be too bad if it happens ; but if ft must , she knows there is nothing for it but to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best of it . These necessary estrangements occur in international politics as in domestic  --  indeed , it has been quite unusual that the Ambassadors of the two major West European powers and their wives should have been good friends at all , so many are the points of friction between their countries  --  but Kitty is one of the world 's nicost people and quite capable of not liking what her husband 's profession  | * between them , suddenly asks , " Why does n't that OLD FUDDY-DUDDI sit down ? " in a whisper so loud that Tom August actually looks up at tin gallery with a startled and annoyed expression . The Problem of Gorotoland little sticky with Raoul and Celestine , but let 's keep on with it as long a , requires them to do . She knows that he does n't like it , either , for he told hei before going up to New York a couple of days ago that " things may get s is temporarily forgotten as all the ladies again exchange amused smiles . Actually on this occasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ambassado of Panama is proceeding , with methods that have often proved effective be fore , in pursuit of purposes that most people usually do not suspect . All of her present companions are aware that there is a lot more to Patsy Jason Labaiya than appears on the ostensibly rattlebrained surface , but this know I 1 11 edge is not shared by the general public or even by many people in Washing ton . " Patsy Labaiya is a very clever woman , " Beth Knox remarked to her hus band when they came home from the diplomatic reception where the I'I had met her for the first time , but Orrin only snorted . " She is ? She conceal it well . " " Beautifully , " Beth agreed , and suggested that he file the fact awa somewhere in his mind for future use . But Orrin had apparently dismissed it , even though he made no attempt in hide from his wife the fact that he considered Patsy 's brother to be someone worthy of the greatest respect and wariness in the political arena @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California , a stupid man , and Beth could not understand why it was so difficult for Orrin to imagine that Ifl some of the family brains might have been conferred upon his sister . Pos sibly it was because the Governor could conceivably pose some threat t Orrin 's ultimate ambitions that Orrin was willing to concede his abilities and not do the same for Patsy ; or possibly it was just that men in politics , even more than men in other lines of endeavor , tend to be unwilling to accord full equality of intelligence to women . Nonetheless , of the five ladies sitting so cordiallY together in the Family Gallery , not one is under any illusion Vi ' III about the wife of Felix Labaiya-Sofra.  | As for Patsy herself , she too at this moment is thinking with the deep concentration of which she is capable about the M'Bulu of Mbuele and the ace where he fits in with the family plans to win the White House for her ther . The Jasons are no different from the Adames , the Harrisons , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numerous than the first , no his ambitious than the last , they too see no reason why one or more of their ' umber should not occupy the fearful seat of power at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue . Her brother is willing , her cousins are eager to help , her aunts and sicles are prepared to spend as many millions as may be required to win the tmaries and add the White House to the other family possessions , and in tsy 's clever mind the whole thing boils down to the question , " What are we waiting for ? " That the principal thing they are waiting for is Orrin Knox lends an extra little ironic fillip to this chance meeting with the Secretary 's wife ; and the game is lent an extra zip by the fact that Patsy assumes that Seth must be as aware of its ironies as she . Beth is , but it says much about the Nvo of them that Beth can sometimes relax and stop thinking about the next election , whereas Patsy Labaiya , like the rest of her family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the M'Bulu of Mbuele to the United Nadens has come as an unexpected bonus , a fortuitous circumstance that must , Ake everything else , be examined for its value to the cause of Ted Jason end used for whatever it may be worth therein . The luncheon in Charleston tomorrow was originally the half-amused , not quite serious idea of Bob Lef6ngwell , passed along to her at the last garden party at " Vagaries " ; but the Idea of bringing it under the aegis of the Jason Foundation and making of the guest list as powerful a cross section of influential opinion-makers as the ' lotion affords , was Patsy 's own . California , despite its fantastic growth , has had relatively few racial explosions of late , and the Governor has consequently had few opportunities to associate himself with the politically suitable side of this politically useful question . Felix had called her from the UN a month ago to suggest that the M'Bulu could be very useful to the family plans if handled right , and her brother , apprised of this , had promised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The gain among the Negro vote , they hope , may be very substantial . Therefore the luncheon has its values , both immediate and long-range ; and k is lent an extra piquancy and excitement by the inspiration , also hers , of bolding it in Seab Cooley 's Charleston . Thank God , Patsy Labaiya tells herself with a scornful glance down at the white-haired figure of the President Pro Tempore , slumped in the Vice President 's chair on the dais , her brother Is n't an insincere racist demagogue like THAT . As for Bob Leffingwell , it may well be that a direct approach should be made to him about joining the Jason forces . In six months ' time , aided by  | the President 's generosity in salvaging his career by appointing him direct ( il of the Commission on Administrative Reform , he has managed to recoup .1 good deal of the ground he lost when the Senate defeated his nomination for Secretary of State . There is a disposition in the country to be fair to a man who has , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and who has now , in the wake of that defeat , gone to work diligently and faithfully for the President who rescued him from what could have been disastrous end to his public usefulness . The attitude of most of his fellow citizens has been : if the President is willing to give him another chanc the country should too . In general , the country has . The only thing that might interfere with Patsy 's plans to bring him her brother 's camp , in fact , is the possibility that he might feel so much gratitude and loyalty to Harley Hudson that he would not wish to take position that could bring him into conflict with Harley 's plans for next yea ' But this would only be true , she suspects , were the President to reverse hi announced decision and decide to run again . If he were , as all indication ? now suggest , to step aside in favor of Orrin Knox , then Bob LeffingwclI might feel perfectly free to join those who wish to defeat Orrin . ParticularI since everyone knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though he has been careful to keep his rare public references suitably decorous . In some ways , Patsy concludes with some annoyance , it is really that old character in the White House who is her brother 's principal obstacle eve more than Orrin Knox . Like so many , she never thought much of him , r Vice President and she does n't think much of him now , in spite of all 1-11 . Geneva triumphs and recent executive energetics. *  | b fawn upon the President . Possibly he deserves some credit for doing what be had to do with a real show of courage , and she is willing to concede him abet ; but , really , this adulation is approaching the ridiculous . It is also making b quite difficult to challenge him politically , or to make any really solid plans obout next year until he makes clear what he intends to do . Like everyone in Washington , Patsy never takes a denial of Presidential ambition to mean that it says , and neither she nor anyone else can believe that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ premises until the Constitution says he absolutely must . Harley , having acceded to office with Idly twenty-one months of his predecessor 's term remaining , faces no bar whatsoever to two full terms for himself if he so desires and can persuade the gDters to approve . Right now his stock is so high that there seems little doubt tat the voters , if requested , will do just that . Whether he will ask them , however , remains his secret ; and now , as Patsy ( , abaiya decides she has been silent long enough and must make some whispered comment to try to persuade the other ladies , unsuccessfully , that the has not really been thinking like a little engine every minute , he is Contemplating it quite seriously as he sits a mile away in the study on the wcond floor of the White House waiting for his lunch . It is a room that olds many memories of many Presidents , but the one he associates it with frost often and most poignantly is the midnight conference last spring when his predecessor attempted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth about Bob Leffingwell . The President has thought many times of that talk , with all its implications and difficulties and terrible national imperatives , which , in the final rendering of judgment , required from his predecessor duplicity and from Brigham Anderson his life . " Suppose you were sitting here ? " his predecessor had said . Well , now he was , and he could see things now that he could n't see then , even though he would never , he honestly believes , have permitted events to carry him to the point of no return to which they had carried the late President . To even contemplate for a second running again is , he tells himself , sheer insanity . It is a terrible job , one of the most terrible ever devised by human ingenuity to meet the need of men to have an organized society ; why should anyone subject himself willingly to its fierce demands ? Yet , he concedes , it exerts a powerful hold , conferring great rewards in return for the human toll it exacts upon those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honor , he believes , and with a courage that can not help pleasing him as he thinks back on the rather scornful and patronizing attitudes of Washington in his Vice Presidential days . Events have given him the opportunity to achieve the basic ambition of most men , which Ir to make the world accept them at their own evaluation . He thanks God  | every day that he possessed the character to do it when the time came . Then ? are still moments , however , when he wonders with awe how it ever cane about , in the mysterious movements of human destiny , and his emotion deepens as he recalls the searing moment of revelation he had as he al , proached the great bronze doors of the Assembly Hall in Geneva that fie fateful afternoon . Now , my boy , he had admonished himself with a deep breath , you 's really got to act like the President . Quite suddenly , like a flash of light thti almost stopped him where he stood , came the thought : I do n't have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President . After that , he had proceeded as though under some other guidance than his own . He had preferred to consider it divine , for that had been his fami I upbringing , and while he knew Harley Hudson had character that few pc ( ple suspected , he also knew it was n't quite as good as all that . Accordingly on his return from Geneva he had declared a day of national prayer and thanksgiving and had led it himself by attending a solemn convocation : 1i the Washington Cathedral . He was gratified to note that it had been join ( l by all denominations and , so far as press estimates could tell , by well over a hundred million of his countrymen . From , that moment , too , he note I with an inner irony , had begun the steady change in press estimation and public attitude which had now resulted , six months later , in making him the most popular Chief Executive in recent years . At first , he would admit , this had been a highly uncertain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the major elements of the America news community had greeted with an alarm approaching hysteria his treat ment of the Russians in Geneva . So violent and vitriolic had been the al tacks upon him from his own country , he remembers now , that it hail seemed for forty-eight hours as though the United States , at least as rely resented by its major communications media , had turned into one gigantic yawp of bellowing agony at the thought of the possible consequences mil maintaining national integrity in the face of the Soviet threat . He wou I t I not blame anybody for being afraid , he remembered telling Bob Munson i his only show of real anger at the time . God knew he was afraid himself But at least he was n't acting like a sniveling baby about it . Twenty-four hours later , of course , after the Soviets had made their mop strously preposterous demands , press , radio , and TV had swung complete about , given him the most absolute support , and poured out upon the Rus sians a scorn at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Bit ' he could never forget that first headlong rush to condemn him , without hesi tation , without judgment , without waiting to ascertain the facts , withouu waiting to see  --  the automatic assumption that their own country must pct  | M be wrong and stubborn and pigheaded and without justification , and that the enemy by the same token must have reason and justice on his side . Of his own inner turmoil and the terrible weakening effect upon him of time attacks by his own countrymen at a moment of absolute decision for be United States , he said nothing publicly then , and it was only after he led been back a few weeks that he made his feelings clear . He had given a lag dinner for some of the nation 's top publishers and unburdened himself e little . " Do you have any idea what it is like to try to face the world and protect the United States with a lot of you boys yapping at my heels all the time ? " be had asked with a mildness that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sting . " To do your best to defeat the people whose major consistent aim b quite literally to destroy the United States of America and then pick up the papers or listen to radio or television and find yourself called a traitor led a fool and a ? an aging child playing with the fires of world destruction , ' $ my good friend from the Post , here , put it ? I 'd expect to read that kind of Stu ' ff in Pravda , but I must confess I was a little surprised to turn around kom facing the Soviets and find my back full of American knives . " They had taken it with a rueful laugh and a round of applause , but they ' had n't liked it at all . Well , he had n't liked what they had done , either , and k had gone on to tell them quietly , " There were a couple of moments there when you almost had me convinced that I was wrong and ought to give in . You just stop and think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then ask yourselves how well you have served your country lately . " The next day the inevitable inside reports from " informed sources " had tarried his off-the-record comments to the public . " A face-to-face dressing ( town of the American press , " the AP described it . " Veteran observers have rarely heard the President so angry , " the UPI agreed . " H.H. DOES AN 1J.S.T. , " the Washington Daily News reported cheerfully ; " GIVES US I JELL . " But he had announced with a friendly smile at the start of his next press conference that he had " decided I 'm not going to answer any questions on White House stag dinners , " the correspondents had laughed , and the flurry had died down . When he noted a couple of weeks later that it had really died down , and that the press had apparently decided that his popularity was such as to make a real attack upon him unwise , he had known with a feeling of genuine triumph that he had won a major victory . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told Orrin next day , " and I do n't think one in ten does it with any but the best of motives . But damn it , they 've got to realize this is n't a tea party we 're in with these people . They 've got to do b responsibly . "  | " odor , the President smiles in an affectionate way . The senior Senator from West Virginia , with his easygoing nature , steady humor , and stubborn dedication in the cause of the United States , may not be as subtle in his methods as might sometimes seem advisable . Yet he inspires , at the UN as in the Senate , a warm regard and a deep and abiding trust in his integrity and rod faith . Lafe Smith of Iowa , replacing Clarence Wannamaker of Monliana , who asked to be relieved to return to his Senate duties , is  --  well , Lafe Smith , liking everybody , liked by everybody , hard-working and able , with Ike extra ingredient of an attitude toward sex which , the President suspects , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delegations than some more strait-laced Americans who have served at the UN in the rt . Possibly Lafe 's recent marriage has curtailed his energies and activities , the President rather doubts it . Unless Lafe has changed mightily , he has ? bably already strengthened relations with half the young ladies in the secretariat . Around the world in eighty days , the President thinks with a mild chuckle at his mild joke , and decides he will have to josh Lafe about it when the Senator is next in Washington . The remainder of the delegation , composed in the usual pattern , consists of the customary State Department advisers and staff and , with an exact attention to the nation 's minorities , a Catholic , a Negro , and a Jew . Of these last , the Negro is the only one who arouses some uneasiness in the mind of the President , who has been wary of changing the delegation left him by his predecessor . LeGage Shelby is something of a problem , and the President , at something of a loss how to solve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young man who heads Defenders of Equality For You ( DEFY ) and has been in the vanguard of the increasingly vigorous drive to overturn the hard-dying racial patterns of the South . It is not that ' Gage Shelby has been openly opposed to United States policy , but he has managed to convey to both his own government and the United Nations as a whole that he is not entirely happy with such attitudes as those concerning Red China , now awaiting admission in two years ' time tinder the compromise finally worked out by Yugoslavia and Ceylon ; the tient tolerance toward France and her still-uneasy relations with the Algerians ; the continuing insistence of the President on adequate disarmalent safeguards in the face of the steady and terrifying growth in the ? atomic club , " now numbering eleven nations , including Communist China ; end the situation in the Caribbean , where the Republic of Panama seems of late to be working with elements not overly friendly to the United States . ' Gage has done a great deal of what he calls , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ African states ; but neither Hal Fry nor the President has been entirely satisfied that all of it was in line with what  | Washington desired . " It is n't that I 'm out of step with you , Mr. President , " LeGage had told him recently with a disarming smile ; " I 'm just an inch or two ahead . " Such candor had momentarily stopped the President , as he wat , sure LeGage had known it would , and he had only said mildly , " Well , you understand of course that it is advisable for all of us to proceed along the 1I same general line if we are to present a united front to the world . " " Abso lutely , " LeGage had said , again with the disarming grin . " You and I could n't see more eye to eye on anything , Mr. President . " But , the President thinks now , of this he is not so sure ; and how to hail ( I ; die LeGage within the context in which he must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major , problems that now concern the occupant of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue . DEFY , a youthful and turbulent offshoot of I the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People , formes I out of the impatience of the younger generation with the cautious older , commands the loyalties of many of the nation 's Negroes in the college anal young-married levels . It was for this reason that the President 's predecessor appointed LeGage to the delegation a year ago and , shortly before his death , announced his intention of appointing him again . The President has gone along with it for reasons that are as practical as his predecessor 's : the simple fact that LeGage is well on his way to becoming one of the nation 's major rcolored politicians , plus the fact that the increasing prominence of the new African states seems to make him a natural for the UN assignment . Now the President wishes he had chosen someone like Cullee Hamilton , even though under the custom which governs appointment of the United States delegation , the Senate and House alternate in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a Senate year . Somewhere , the President recalls , he has heard that Cullee and LeGage roomed together at Howard University right here in Washington , and it it , quite possible that the young Congressman from California may have some useful insights into the chairman of DEFY that would prove helpful to the p I ! White House . He makes a mental note to talk to him about it if the op portunity arises and thinks with genuine pleasure of his few brief contacts with Cullee in the past . He has always found him eminently sensible , he thinks approvingly  --  and then assures himself hastily that he does n't mean that as patronizingly as it might sound if said d aloud . Cullee has not been sensible in the negative sense that Seab Cooley might use the word in de scribing a Negro ; rather , he has seemed sensible to the President in the sense of his understanding of the needs of all parties involved in what the iii President considers the major domestic problem , human , economic , emo tional , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think we should move too fast , " Cullee had said three years ago  | when the then Vice President had asked him to drop by his Senate office hr a private chat after the Congressman had testified before the Senate ludiciary Committee , " but we should move . That 's the important thing . We 've got to keep moving . History wo n't let us stop now . " There was , the President was pleased to find , an absence of the cusmmary cant , true but fatuous in its false emphasis , about " the eyes of the world are on you , America . " There was just a firm insistence on America king true to what America ought to be , irrespective of what anybody else might think . Just because there were certain things that America , being America , must necessarily do and certain high standards that she must evenWally live up to if she were to be ultimately whole . Compared with LeGage , who is always giving lengthy interviews about ' America 's solemn obligation in the eyes of humanity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she does not disappoint humanity 's hopes , " this is a very sensible position on Cullee 's part . It is not demogogic  --  indeed , the Congressman is so calm-spoken and mild in outward bearing that political Washington somedines wonders how he ever got elected in the first place  --  and it is not the Sort of thing to win big headlines in the papers . But it is , the President suspects , an attitude that , matched by a similar attitude on the part of responsible whites both North and South , will ultimately provide a solution If solution is to be found . If solution is found ! He snorts , startling the butler bringing in his lunch . It has to be found . He sighs at the unending complexity of the problems that beset the President , and instantly a hundred pressing urgencies rush into his mind . Trouble in Asia  --  trouble in Africa  --  trouble in the Middle East  --  trouble in Latin America  --  disarmament talks  --  a slight sag in business  --  unemployment rising  --  missile program still lagging behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South Carolina  --  the space program  --  maintaining the moon expedition , readying another  --  Governor Edward Jason of California and his ambitions  --  Orrin 's ambitions  --  his own ambitions and/or lack OE them  --  criticism by America 's enemies  --  criticism by America 's friends ? the United Nations  --  anti-American riots in Lima , West Germany , Manila , Capetown , Panama City  --  bills he must sign  --  people he must see  --  things he must worry about . . . it never ends . And always , overriding all else , the constant evil pressures from the Communist world , inflaming every problem , increasing every difficulty , negating every hope for peace in a blind , insensate drive toward world destruction so automatic by now that he doubts if the Kremlin could reverse itself and rejoin the decent purposes of a decent humanity even if it wanted to .  | He finds it difficult not to feel that this is , as Bob Munson remarked to him the other day with a surprising melancholy , a haunted autumn ; indeed , ; i haunted era @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Majority Leader had said , " I do n't trust it . " Whether there are valid grounds for this premonitory sad ness , the President does not know ; probably no more than at any time in the past decade or , if the world is so fortunate as to have one , the next decade . But he , too , can not escape the frequently recurring feeling that things everywhere are moving toward some sort of climax , one that may come a month from now , a year , two years , a day , a minute : who knows Ever since the last war the Russians have engaged in a relentless and un ceasing campaign to push tensions everywhere to their absolute peak ; and the human animal does not live forever under such conditions without any explosive release into violence  --  it is simply beyond human nature . War may come , the President feels , for no other reason than that the Soviets have deliberately created so many tensions in so many places that there is nothing else that can logically happen except war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such a holocaust and wonder , what , if anything , a man even in his position can do to stop it . Sometimes he considers the struggling masses of the earth and it seems to him that their leaders are no more than chips on a tide , flung this way and that by the necessities of national security and self-interest and the pres sures of the inarticulate yet insistent millions below . No sane man aware of the facts wants to destroy the world ; but who , nowadays , is sane , and who has all the facts ? Even he , on whom so many heavy responsibilities and desperate hopes devolve , often thinks that he possesses no greater light to see by than anyone else in the fitful darkness that rests upon the twentieth century . Lost in such thoughts he does not realize for a moment that he has stopped with his sandwich halfway to his s mouth and is staring bIanklY out at tlxI Washington Monument , the river , and autumn - tawny Virginia beyond . Then he starts , gives his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lettuce sandwich sent up from the White House kitchen . He had asked for chicken , he recalls with an ironic smile : even here , the President is power less to set the course . Like the rest of the world , he will take what the kitchen sends him and make the best of it . He wonders if anyone else undergoes such prolonged and self-scarifying ; appraisals as he has found himself called upon to undertake since he entered the White House ; and concludes that probably many do , though possibly none with quite the direct and agonizing personal involvement of the Presi dent . " The buck stops here , " Harry Truman had put it , in a sign he kept on  | his desk . " I am all alone , " Harley 's own predecessor had remarked in a tone of absolute desolation , in a secret telephone call Harley had never told anyone about , on the morning after Brigham Anderson 's death . In a world of Problems that range from men on the moon to the relatively minor yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delegation at the GN , the President now realizes to the full the import of both these comments , at once curiously pathetic and deeply terrifying , on the office he now occupies . As for the United Nations , which he has thus returned to in the course of his absent-minded and preoccupied lunching , he wonders how the sesdon is going today and what Orrin will have to report when he calls in later . The Problem of Gorotoland is not a simple one either , filled as it is with implications of an argument with allies , and the President contemplates it with teal misgivings . Trouble anywhere is sooner or later trouble for the United States in these times , and in the person of the M'Bulu of Mbuele he can tense all sorts of potentials for trouble . He thinks for a moment of putting In a call to the Secretary-General , just to get another point of view on the situation , but then abandons it for the time being . The S : G. he considers a friend of his , they had enjoyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ session of the General Assembly  --  but the thought occurs to him that perhaps he should hold in reserve against a time of real need any further direct contact . It might be interpreted now as going behind Orrin 's back , and that would be most unfortunate . Nonetheless he wonders whether the Secretary-General , agent of an organization with such great potential capabilities but so little real power , is ever moved by such philosophizings as those which come to him who has so much real power as bead of a state whose capabilities are felt wherever men live . If he were to make the phone call , instead of abandoning it for a later day , he would find that the Secretary-General , sitting in his office on the thirty-eighth floor of the Secretariat building , is indeed filled with a comparable concern . He has changed the chaste decor left him by his predecessor ? there is more color in the room and a livelier atmosphere in which to conduct negotiations  --  yet far below in the General Assembly Hall , the Security Council , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of earth remain as obdurate and contentious and far apart as ever . For this , the S : G. thinks moodily , he is not to blame , yet he can not avoid feeling , as other idealistic men in his position have felt before him , that he bears a major responsibility . Like them , he has come into office to find his powers ill-defined , his duties circumscribed by the conflicting national interests of more than a hundred nations , and his office the focus for a conttant tug of war between the Communist and non-Communist worlds . In-  | deed , he would not be here were it not for this constant conflict ; and the t fact that he is here , in and of itself automatically makes him almost impotent Remembering his election , outcome of two months of bitter struggle be tween East and West , the S : G. sometimes wishes one of the other candi , . dll dates had received sufficient votes : then at least the issue would be clear . I ; illllp But the East would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the East . Finally his name had been mentioned , almost as an afterthought , by the British . Within two days sentiment in the lounges , the corridors , and 1 the delegation headquarters scattered through midtown Manhattan had co , i ill lesced in his favor and he had been elected . " Il n'est pas un Pape de Rome , " II'I Raoul Bane had commented to the prime minister of the Secretary-General ' . JI country . " It est un Pape d'Avignon . " And in truth , for ineffectualness and inability to do the things the salvation of the world so clearly demanded , h " was . For this state of affairs , he reflects , the Communists are largely responsible ' , for their constant attacks upon the office of the Secretary-General and then steady hammering at the morale of the Secretariat have inevitably , in time , lbegun to produce some of the results they desire . The attack begun by thn ' late Chairman of the Council of Ministers during his raucous attendance at the Fifteenth General Assembly has borne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now both the office of the Secretary-General and th " ' Secretariat are closer to real impotence than they have ever been . Even during the high point reached in the early stages of the crisis in the JI Congo , their powers and influence at best had not been very great ; now they have declined to a sort of innocuous and ineffective housekeeping that not all the earnest editorials at the time of his election have been able to redress . " It is with renewed hope , " the New York Times had commented then , " that the world hails the election of a new Secretary-General . Now , if ever , the United Nations has a chance to halt the decline of recent years and climb back to the high plateau of goodwill and sound endeavor that men everywhere still hope to find in the world organization . " Well , the hope had not been justified , because men everywhere did not hope to find the goodwill and sound endeavor so dutifully invoked by the Times . A great many of them just hoped to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world conquest . And their campaign to re 11duce the United Nations to just such a mechanism has made ominous and stead s deman11111 ever since . n Endless a ates , endless arguments , endless c  | Now , he thinks as he goes into his private apartment off the office to see whether his heavy beard needs a quick shave before he goes down to lunch with Terence Ajkaje and the Soviet Ambassador in the Delegates ' Dining Room on the fourth floor , all is tenuous and uncertain and the future is dimmer than it has ever seemed , even in the great slab-sided glass monolith that houses the United Nations . " We fly on a wing and a prayer , " his American deputy had told a luncheon meeting of the United Nations Correspondents Association a week ago , " if we fly at all . " Yet there is , he tells himself with a sort of angry hopelessness , such great potential for good in the flimsy shield , riddled with national self-interest and competing sovereign claims , which men erected in San Francisco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves against the dismal winds that howl down the reaches of history . Only yesterday he had Sopped by the offices of the Technical Assistance Fund on the twenty-ninth floor and been shown proudly by its director an enormous map of the world with little colored pins scattered over the surface , each representing a UN ' Mission . Sometimes the mission consisted of eight or ten people ; sometimes , b the vast expanse of some desert nation or the steaming jungles of another 's almost impenetrable heartland , the pin would represent just one man - just one , for so many hundreds of thousands of square miles , so many Millions of people . But it was a start  --  it was a start . Here and there in the darkness the UN was lighting little lights . " Maybe a hundred years from now it will all add up to something , " he had remarked somewhat bitterly to the director , a doughty little Welshman grown gray in the service of the world organization .

Maybe that , in the long run , is a work of the United Nations 1 ' : more hopeful and far more lasting than all the bitter political wrangles that go on in the Assembly and the Security Council . Here in Turtle Bay on tit ( East River , in the sheer marble-and-green-glass shaft of the Secretariat , he . aware that dedicated people from all the races of man are working in flit light of a fragile promise and a desperate hope . They are people as human , as imperfect , as subject to red tape and petty ambition and simple error a people everywhere , yet for the most part he has found them to be earnest and idealistic and devoted to the world organization and the good of human ity . He sometimes wishes that those who freely criticize the UN could know , as he knows , the patient , persistent , day-by-day work of the organza tion as it attempts , so doggedly and under such great handicaps , to push bac I. the night that threatens to engulf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light is so feeble .

And so , he thinks with an abrupt bitterness as he pauses for a moment t ? q stare out his apartment 's glass wall at the steel and concrete crags of Manhat tan that balance his office 's East River view over Brooklyn on the other side , one manages to convince oneself that it all adds up to something and reall does encourage hope , and that the vicious political conflicts of the UN an really less important than its small , snail-like progressions in the area of social , economic , and human relations . One can almost persuade oneself that a Corn munist pounding on his desk to stop free debate , or an African sneering a ' a white man , or a white man bitterly denouncing another white man , ca all be wiped out by sweetness and light in the Economic and Social Council or a tentative glow of compassion in the Children 's Fund . It would be nie to think so , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the fearful bitternesses that really matter ; it is the terrifying divisions that really control man 's fate , not the temporary and tiny co-operations . And here he knows , as any honest man must know , that the outlook is not promising and the future is not bright . Ever since Geneva the neutral states have been beating a path to his door . The burden of each has been essential ! the same : Protect us . " Protect you ! " he had finally blown up at the smugly self-righteous repro sentative of Ghana . " Protect you , when you did everything you could to subvert the Congo , and always try to play your own imperialist game in Africa ! Why should I protect you , even if the Charter and the big Power , gave me the authority to do it ? " The Ghanaian had been angrily resentful and accused him of being lackey of the British ; but the S.-G. ' s barb had sunk home , and it had been  | fully justified . They all wanted to follow their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the going got rough they wanted a man whose powers they had blandly connived to diminish to come running and help them out . When they get scared , he thinks , they turn tail fast enough ; but it is almost loo late for them to do so , because bit by bit they have helped to whittle sway the always flimsy powers of his office until now it is an almost empty shell . In the aftermath of the dramatic confrontation between the American President and the Soviet Chairman at Geneva , this fact annoys and frustrates him increasingly as the tensions heighten . He does what he can to ameliorate differences ; tries his best to serve as a bridge between East and West ; is respected by the United States , treated with contempt by the Soviet Empire and its colonies , beseeched by the Africans and Asians , ignored by the Latin Americans , patronized by the French , criticized by the British , advised by the Indians , given hearty admonitions by the Canadians , and made much of by the American press . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He may be a figurehead to some , but he does rate well with the New York Times , the Post , and the Herald Tribune . This is not such insignificant support , either , since most delegates to the UN are sensitive to the writings Of the metropolitan press and eager to find themselves mentioned in its pages . Today they should all be quite happy , for The Problem of Gorotoland is teceiving its full share of attention , and discussions concerning it are being followed most attentively by all channels of communication . He is not sur'sed that this should be so , for he has followed the career of Terence jkaje ever since he met him in London ten years ago . It is not unexpected at the M'Bulu should have been able to take a matter so dear to the hearts the press and raise it with skilled showmanship to a major international Issue . It would be surprising , in fact , if he did not do so , adept as he is at parlaying his flair for the dramatic into big news . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events in Molobangwe and elsewhere , d headlines , radio reports , and television commentaries are bound to folw , in America . It is no wonder that the UN , which in its standard legal dance is " seized of " issues when it assumes jurisdiction over them , should seized indeed of Terrible Terry . The thought of this brings a smile to the Secretary-General 's face for a second as he drops world problems to concentrate on his beard . " I do n't have eve-o'clock shadow , " he remembers telling Senator Fry of the United States the other day ; " with me , it is more like g A.M. " " It is n't noticeable , " Hal Fry ( assured him , " but if it bothers you , why do n't you give in and let it grow ? " F he Secretary-General had shaken his head with a smile . " That 's only for northerners like the Ethiopians . I would n't want to get people confused . "  | He decides now that he can probably get by without a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Waldorf tonight , especially since he does n't want to run the risk of cutting his chin again . He frowns as he notes the tiny clot of dried blood from the morning 's accident , but again. ? the black skin it shows hardly at all , and after a moment he forgets it and turns away . Then he leaves the beautiful apartment with its sensational view of New York , walks past the pleasant office with its sensational view of Brooklyn and the river , quickly paces off the long corridor to the elevate l , pushes the bell , and , after a moment , steps in . The Javanese girl who operate , the elevator greets him respectfully ; he responds , and then stands with hand clasped behind him and head thoughtfully bowed as they glide swift I v downward to the halls and corridors far below where the bickering heirs ( ) I Adam conduct their talkative and tendentious business . 4 yl It was at moments like this , the M'Bulu told himself with a happy satisfa ( lion , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) their greatest possible scope , that the world could not possibly avoid admit ting that he was as dashing and effective a figure as he knew himself to be .

At least , most of them were attentive . The British Ambassador was , you could be sure of that , for all his outward bland imperviousness ; and the America . Secretary of State , and the Soviet Ambassador , and indeed nearly everyone else around the globe , for today almost every seat in the big pale mahogany NI 1I and-blue bowl of First Committee was filled . Only Cameroun and Cone Brazzaville were absent , and he knew what he thought of them , particular ) Cameroun . He made a mental reference to Cameroun 's ancestors which wsr not complimentary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spiteful flourish , drew himself to his full six-feet-seven , and turned to th ( L fl Yugoslav delegate in the Chair with a suitable dignity as all those on the floor and in the press and public galleries who did not speak English ad justed their earphones and prepared to listen attentively . " Mr. Chairman , " he said soberly in his chopped , guttural accent , " I must thank you on behalf of my people in Gorotoland for permitting me to al ) pear here before this august committee of the United Nations on this matter so dear to their hearts . A long period of desperate suffering under a ruthics colonialism " ? he was aware of the slightest hint of motion from Lord Mauch  | ' sync and found it difficult to refrain from a broad grin ?

The distinguished Soviet delegate has already given you that sorry story this morning . It is one that does no *edit to the colonial power which has been responsible . " He looked squarely It Lord Maudulayne , who returned the look with the slightest of ironic winks that clearly conveyed the comment : Why , you hypocritical little pip-squeak . Terry broke into a sunny smile and marveled at how effectively he could make his tone change altogether . " But , Mr. Chairman , " he cried , " at last there is hope ! Hope from the United Nations ! Hope from the United States and the Soviet Union !

In the midst of it the British Ambassador raised his hand for recognition . " Mr. Chairman , " he said from his seat in a flatly impassive tone that instantly silenced the chamber , " exercising briefly the right of reply , I simply wish to reiterate again that Her Majesty 's Government have entered into a solemn obligation to establish the independence of Gorotoland in one year 's lime . There has been , to my knowledge , no change in this position to warnt the assumption just made by His Royal Highness . Nor can there be , til the territory achieves adequate preparation for self-government . Surely is Highness is aware of that . " And he pushed aside his microphone with an air of tired distaste , amid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout the room . At the rostrum the M'Bulu permitted an expreson of sadness to disturb his primordially handsome face , but when he reed it was in a tone of patient tolerance . " Mr. Chairman , the distinguished delegate of the United Kingdom ?  | whom I like to consider , " he added , with a wistful smile , " my good personal friend , however these differences of policy may divide us  --  is , as usual suc cinct and to the point . Naturally I am aware of the commitments undertaken by Her Majesty 's Government . I am also aware that history does not always , wait upon formal commitments . I am also aware " ? and his voice began to rise again ? " that freedom is impatient ! Justice is impatient ! Gorotoland k impatient ! What is the right thing to do is impatient ! Her Majesty 's Govern ment should remember that , too ! " But , Mr. Chairman , " he said , and he permitted his voice to modulate gently , " I am hopeful .

I shall visit Washington , D.C. , and there , I understand , the President of the United States , that great man whom we all admire " ? there was a thump from Vasily Tashikov , answering laugh ter from others , and with a sudden grin Terry amended his statement " whom some of us admire , will entertain me at a dinner in the White House . And also , though we have our differences here , I understand that the dis tinguished delegate of the U.K. and his delightful wife , who is known to many of you , will entertain for me at a reception at Her Majesty 's Embassy . So , you see , though we argue here and have our differences in this great house of the nations , we are still all friends . I think we should all , " he added with a commanding gesture that started and encouraged the responding ap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humanity and friendlines which mean that no real bitterness can linger here . " " That 's what you say , " Orrin Knox murmured to Lord Maudulayne , who replied with an ironic snort . " I defy you to get up now and say all this is n't so , " he whispered back . " You see how simple it is . Seek and ye shall find . Demand and ye shall get . The powers of the West are but as sheep , and , 1 little child is leading them . " " Little child , my hat , " said Orrin Knox . " Some child ! " But in this , as the M'Bulu bowed low and prepared to move on to the peroration of his brief address , the Secretary of State might possibly have been mistaken ; for behind the broad-planed face and towering body before them at the rostrum there were many complex things , and one of them might well have been a little child . Certainly Terrible Terry was filled with a happiness so tense and excited that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a child 's exuberance  --  a certain kind of child . The kind who might , in a moment of exhilaration , kill a lion with a spear , or catch a running wildebeest on foot , or , perhaps , castrate an enemy tribesman over a slow-burning fire and then roast the results for dinner .  | For there was much to the M'Bulu of Mbuele that of course could not be known to great sections of the rest of the world , though it was clearly understood by many of his compatriots from the vast upsurging continent who , like himself , now appeared amid the trappings of Western civilization in the gleaming glass citadel of the UN . Many an echo from the savage depths 01 mankind was present , though not all white men were sensitive enough ID perceive it in the bustling lounges , the long , murmurous corridors , and the contentious conference rooms on the East River . No tribal drums rounded in Turtle Bay , but their faint , insistent beat was never far from many ears ; and in few did they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Terence Wolowo Ajkaje . It would have been important for many men to find out why , had there ken time and not ten thousand other things to think about , for an underwanding of his background and purposes might have permitted some more reasoned attempt to be forewarned and thus forearmed . But possibly even that would not have been enough . Intelligent anticipation can only go so far , even under the best of circumstances ; and the M'Bulu was one of history 's sports in an age that encouraged them : extremely smart , extremely clever , deceptive , misleading , erratic , but , as many were now to find out to their sorrow , erratic with a plan . That the plan was not his own , but that he should have been able to lend himself to it so willingly and improve upon it so brilliantly in his own right , was a tribute to a mind that had traveled a long way since it first became sentient in Gorotoland . Now as he stood in First Committee gathering his thoughts for his final comments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Assembly take up The Problem of Gorotoland , he was thinking with an approving awe of that predestined forward progress which had brought him to the point where he could sway the nations of the world . It had not appeared at first that he would even live to maturity , let alone achieve so high a dignity in the councils of the earth . He had been born , twenty-nine years before , to the seventh wife of the 136th chief in direct descent from the legendary first M'Bulu , the great warrior Molobangwe . Many were the tales of this great one , and numerous the rival chieftains he was said to have killed to consolidate his power . One by one he had subjugated seven warring tribes , carefully marrying all the widows he created with each new conquest . ( " You call George Washington the father of your country , " Terry was fond of remarking during his year at Harvard . " You should have seen the man I 'm descended from . " ) By the time he died peacefully on his pallet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for some years to expire so uneventfully  --  Molobangwe  | had carved for himself a sizable kingdom and done more than any other on , man to populate it with the dominant Goroto people . 1,111 The kingdom , consisting of a small area of mountain highlands , soul dusty plains and sparse grasslands , a few elusive streams , and two fair-sized , sedgy lakes , was favored by nature just sufficiently to permit its people a bare subsistence if they worked from sunup to sundown from the day of birth t the day of death . The populace , filled with the innumerable progeny of tla late warrior king , was almost fatally diverted from this necessary diligene for the better part of half a century , for it was immediately torn apart h% rival claimants to the vacant throne . ( When he was at Oxford , Terry like I to refer to this as " our Wars of the Roses , " which sometimes made his h , , I teners wince . ) Out of the constant raiding , fighting , and general bloodshed I there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 137 M'Bulus . With the thirty-eighth , a great-nephew in the female line of tin great Molobangwe ( although which female , tribal elders were never entirely clear ) , there finally arose a youth firm enough and strong enough to cm again impose upon his warring people much the same pax virilis as that imposed by his fertile forebear . By a brisk policy of beheading his enemies and impregnating their wives , III he managed in ten years , time to pacify Gorotoland and turn its people once II again to the problem of eking out a living in the highlands , where some of hI them hunted , and on the plains , where the remainder grazed their cattle . He must in his way , as his descendant the 137th M'Bulu sometimes though ! with real respect , have been something of a statesman , for he was able t work out a trading relationship between the hunters and the grazers that per I mitted them to live together in peace instead of existing forever at each other 's throats , as was so often the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat of government the town of Mbuele in the highlands , thus adding to his title for all time the name of its first capital . It was only several hurl dred years later that the capital came down to Molobangwe on the plains as the result of a marriage between the two leading families in the nation a choice that Terrible Terry deplored but which he could not change eveiI in the mid-twentieth century , so rigid were the iron rules of tribal custom that still bound the ruler of Gorotoland to this day . The centuries passed and other M'Bulus succeeded the pacifier of moue taro and plain ; in Europe and Asia civilization advanced across the hem spheres , great states rose and fell , wars and revolutions and dynastic enter prises swept the earth , men drew maps and navigated the globe , developed science and theology and medicine , began to think , first in idle dreams and then with mounting excitement , beyond the planet to the stars . In Goroto  | hod , as in the rest of Black Africa , life never changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lived , and died in accordance with ancient ritual . Tradition , superstition , terror , and ignorance ruled the life of the people . Around succeeding M'Bulus and the elder priests who presently came lo form their council of state there encrusted an inflexible way of doing things that raised men barely above the beasts they hunted and the beasts they grazed and kept them there , apparently forever . So ages passed to the middle of what was known , in distant regions out of sight and out of mind , as the nineteenth century . And then suddenly the white man was everywhere in Africa , adventuring after gold , after diamonds , sometimes , encouraged by willing rulers such as the present M'Bulu 's grandfather , after slaves ; pushing up river valleys , handing along the endless coasts , trading , colonizing , bringing an impatient , pushing , ambitious , violent , explosive , restless , never-fulfilled and neverlttisfied civilization to all but the most inaccessible parts of the black continent . Some sentimentalists found it fashionable now to bemoan this invadon , alternating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the noble savagery which had prevailed before . Terrible Terry Was not among them . If it had n't happened , he would n't be here now addressing the First Committee of this wobbly parliament of man ; nor would he be able to command the attention of NBC , ABC , CBS , Time , Life , or the New York Times . Savage innocence ? They could have it ! He would take " Meet the Press " any day . For Gorotoland , the transition to British rule was sanguine and abrupt . A small exploratory expedition sent out by the Royal Geographic Society came innocently one day to Molobangwe in the sun . Fifteen savage minutes later its members were mercifully beyond sensation as a surprised and indignant reception committee readied them for lunch . The response of the Crown was inevitable and immediate . Two weeks later a full-scale military expedition appeared on the horizon , and by sundown a thousand of the M'Bulu 's finest warriors were dead , seven members of his Council of Elders were hanging from nearby thorn trees , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignominious captivity . Life was simpler in those days when there was no First Committee to appeal to , and the whole thing was ecided with a dispatch no longer permitted in seeking solutions to the orld 's more irritating problems . Disraeli turned up one morning at Windr with good news for the Queen and , graciously if a trifle vaguely , she cepted one more jewel in her diadem and Gorotoland joined that long ' st of rather inadvertent and absent-minded conquests which turned the ap crimson and , for a time now gone forever , gave the sun something to ine upon wherever it went .  | There ensued a period of uneasy dominion which inculcated deep in th ( Goroto people and their ruler those traits of dissembling , deviousness , and deceit which were , though few who watched him at the rostrum now wel aware of it , so much a part of the 137th M'Bulu . It went against ti n grain to give up slavery , ritual sacrifices , and the privilege of devouring on ( " opponents ; and back in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , despite the earnest efforts of the sweating , sandy-haired , red-faced , mil , tachioed , exasperated but terribly , terribly self-controlled young men wl , a came out from London to do their best for the Empire and , quite sincerck for the natives . The natives never really did desire all this well-meant awn tion , having been much happier in a state of self-ruled slaughter and thy ? own precarious trade balance between hill and plain . Toward the end something approaching a grudging tolerance for tip colonizers finally became general in Gorotoland  --  they tried so hard , and were so inexplicably just , and it was so easy to pull the wool over their ey ( and go right on doing what one had always done  --  but there was never any time any real affection or loyalty . Not even when , with the country ' population pushing toward two million , thanks to white man 's administration white man 's medicine , and white man 's peace , the British instituted a mode i but definite program of sending a few of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's world . This was regarded as one more example of an innate and baffling foolishness on their part , but it did not take loll , for the ruling family and the Council of Elders to perceive that this was good thing and they had better allow a certain number to get in on it . Th number , a fact known to Terry but unknown to Lord Maudulayne when they had argued the matter earlier that morning , was decided by the native themselves . Education was restricted to those selected by the then M'Bu I and his immediate advisers and it was , they thought then , in their best terest to extend it to no more than a handful . Later , when independence swept Africa and the M'Bulu 's grandson was hurtled on the tide of it inn , his demand for immediate freedom , the grandson could have wished it had been more broadly based to provide him with a greater corps of potential ad ministrators . But by then , of course , it was too late . For himself , however , Terence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be pleased ) Wolowo Ajkaje could not complain , once he had surmounted the apparently insurmountable obstacle of being born to the seventh wife nI his late father . Ahead of him in the succession were four half brothers , and for thirteen of his years in the dusty royal compounds of Molobangwe i i seemed likely that he would never be anything more than a very secondar brother of whoever succeeded to the throne , providing that worthy allowel I  | 11m and the other brothers to live at all once he came to power . Indeed , mere was considerable danger that some such sudden termination of his weer might occur even before his father passed from the picture , so violent ' ere the intrafamily feuds that surrounded the succession . But the genius this more notable ancestors , having skipped his father and several precedrg M'Bulus , seemed to have lodged in Terry , and with a shrewdness bepnd his years he dissembled his brains , hid his clever and overactive intellice , and went about with an air of stumbling stupidity that provoked ud cries of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other wives . To his mother , whom he only wished he could have brought along to see Mm at the United Nations , and would have had she not been Regent d also badly crippled with arthritis , the M'Bulu felt that he owed most his native abilities . He had never forgotten a wild night in his sixth year en a thunderstorm had seemed to come up from all of Africa below them the south . Without a word his mother had taken him firmly by the hand Ind slipped away from the compound to a great bare baobab tree that stood on a little rise looking toward the mountains . There , with a sort of wild crooning chant whose echoes in memory could still make him shiver , she had Implored the assistance of their ancestors and all the tribal gods for one , tingle , all-consuming purpose : " Make my son M'Bulu ! Make my son M'Bulu ! Make  --  my  --  son  --  M'Bulu ! " At the height of the storm the ancestors and gods had reached down and , in a blinding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground . " Damn-fool woman is lucky the lightning did n't kill them both , " the Resident had grumbled hopelessly the next morning when they were still resting from the shock in the little makeshift hospital in Molobangwe ; but neither he nor his mother ever doubted that they had been given a pledge of divine assistance for her ambitions , which thereafter became his own . It took six years for the gods and ancestors to contrive the means to do it In the crowded compounds , but suddenly one day after his mother had passed silently outside a window overlooking a fireplace where a broth was being prepared for his two oldest half brothers , the gods and ancestors began to make good on their pledge . Within two hours his half brothers were rolling in agony in the dust , and a couple of hours after that his father had two less heirs . Inevitably this stirred sharp suspicions in Gorotoland , but the gods and ancestors had been as good as their bond : his mother bad not been seen , and her protestations of innocence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and turned instead upon one of the Council of Elders , who presently vanished somewhere in the highlands and was heard from no more , despite the Resident 's earnest attempts for six months to find him .  | A short time after that , the gods and ancestors intervened again , apparently on this occasion entirely on their own volition . The younger of his two rc ? maining half brothers contracted a genuine case of pneumonia in the midst of the rainy season and was carried off in three days . That left one , a boy ( d fourteen , one year older than himself , son of his father 's fifth wife ; and now , it seemed to Terry , it was time for the gods and ancestors to again tal:rr an active hand in his destiny . It took him several months to decide how to help them go about it , but the approach of the annual puberty rites , held in a great cave in the high lands near the ancient capital of Mbuele , gave him the idea . The year befor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he and his brother had bccI permitted to watch in wide-eyed excitement from the outer reaches of tht cave as the ceremony , in which the older men of the tribe were mingle with the novitiate to youths , reached its peak . There came a moment when elders and young stark naked and inflamed with fermented banana bcci standing in a great circle in the dimly lit cave , the ceremony reached climax and everyone became so busy that no normal male could concentrat on anything but the sensations of his own body . Terry was normal enough in that , but he was abnormal in his powers of concentration and will That moment , it seemed to him , would be the ideal moment for the gods and ancestors to insert a knife between the ribs of his half-conscious , half-blind , all-animal brother . And so , as events went forward , it came about . With great presence 0 ! mind he concealed the knife beforehand ; pretended to drink but refrain ( l Ill from it ; and when the final moment came , did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then eased his dying brother gently down upon nearby rock , unnoticed in the general grunting frenzy all around . Instead of fleeing the cave , he simply moved to another part of it , until he was on tilt other side of the fiercely quaking circle . And when , some hours later , the firth spent novitiate staggered awake and tripped across the cold body of h brother , it was by then much too late for anyone to discover how the god and ancestors had performed so foul a deed . ( Far away in America , Tim ( magazine took its first notice of Terrible Terry in an account of the strange series of royal fatalities in Gorotoland , entitled " A Little Fresh Heir . " But of course no one in Gorotoland ever saw it , and it was soon forgotten by the rest of the world , for although it was an example of shrewd speculation , the fact to support it could not be proved . ) Thus at thirteen Terence Ajkaje became the heir apparent to Gorotoland and a fortunate absence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father 's remaining five wives made it unnecessary for him and his moth (  | OD seek any more divine assistance . They could now proceed to prepare him , with the rather dazed concurrence of his father , who could not understand why the gods and ancestors had bereft him of so many heirs , for the throne . In the boy and his mother the British found both the material and the appreciation for what they were trying to do in education . There was no doubt , the Resident reported to London , that the heir to Gorotoland was as kight as a whip , or possibly three or four whips . He recommended every encouragement , and that was what the Colonial Office , in its ponderous but eventually efficient fashion , set out to provide . Recalling now the stages of his education as he stared blandly down upon lord Maudulayne and the rest in First Committee , the M'Bulu of Mbuele could not escape a small ironic bow in the confines of his mind to those who had opened the doors of the world for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said in a silent conversation that Claude Maudulayne could not hear but would not have been surprised about if he had ; oh , yes , you did it well . More fools you , but  --  you did it well . First had come shoes and European clothing , and an awkward period of practicing with them that lasted until time to leave for the trip to Mombasa and the slow steamer up the east coast , through Suez into the Mediterranean , and so past the soft green shores of fertile France to the misty little island that now , in the aftermath of her second great war , was saying good-by with increasing speed to all the lands on so many continents and across so many as over which she had for so long held dominion . The British were a revelation to Terry , as they are to most who visit them at home ; and in some strange way he both resented and admired , could not understand and yet could not ever entirely escape , they had left their mark upon him forever , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , he told himself now with irony that was not quite irony and rcasm not entirely sarcastic as he readied his concluding words of appeal to e nations sitting silently before him , there would always be in Gorotoland some little piece of blackness that would be forever England ; and whether he or the English would ever understand the curious love-hate of it , either in Gorotoland or in so many other places in Asia and Africa where their stuffy , proud , and strangely gallant cavalcade had passed , he very much doubted . This , however , was a mature thought now , long after that first unforgettable passage up the Solent into Southampton Water ; the ride into London on the tootling train through the tidy little fields , green with a greenness even the highlands of Gorotoland could not match ; and his first excited introduction to the strange ways and strange world of the white man . The  | page deleted  | page deleted  | the firm determination to leave behind as many heirs as possible . He was pleased to learn a month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States he went about as determined to absorb impression , and knowledge as he had been in Britain . He arrived with his reputation fairly well established , and while he had decided that it would be best to , play down the " Terrible Terry " side of it , at least in public ( in private , he found himself as eagerly pursued in Harvard Yard and along the gaudier reaches of the eastern seaboard as he had ever been in Oxford and London ) , he put the rest of it to good use . Great racial ferment was under way in America , too , which was one rca son he had wanted to go there , and he promptly found himself in great demand from many groups in both races as a speaker and adviser on African lllil affairs .

" In my country , you know , we eat people . This is quite a change . " They had roared with happy laughter and considered him the most charm ing spoofer . After that he adopted a sort of sardonic double-talk with his American hosts which they always took with absolute seriousness . The Bri t ish , he decided , always believed that you were going to tell them the truth , and eventually caught up with you if you lied ; the Americans always believed that you were telling them the truth , and never caught up with you if you lied . He still found this puzzling , at times , but it did not stop him  | horn using the fact with the most calculating ruthlessness to advance his personal and national ambitions . In contrast to what he found in America , the harsh dynamism of Soviet Russia and the steady hammering advance of Communism upon the citadels of the West had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself the experience of studying in Moscow , even though the iet Government had secretly invited him on several occasions ; his business was with the West and he did not wish to alienate it unduly . Possibly if he had gone there he would have been less impressed and less willbig to be gullible about it . But to him , as an African watching the world lonvulsion go forward after the Second World War , seeing the confused Ind ineffectual way the West attempted to withstand it , perceiving in it all die opportunities it held for the clever little mice to play while the great cats were at one another 's throats , he inevitably came to admire and respect the loviet approach . It was as cruel , as brutal , as heartless , and as cold-blooded his own . The words were roseate , the principles were noble , the slogans were as ringing as any to be found in the West ; but , underneath , the undeviating purpose and aim was as deceitful , as deceptive , as devious and unprincipled and greedy for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Communists talked as volubly as the West of shining goals ; but the Commudsts acted , too , and the talk turned out to be a lie : and the lie worked . No one with a background such as Terry 's could fail to be impressed by that . It was no wonder that since his father 's deep senility he had permitted the secret entry of Soviet and Chinese Communist advisers and technicians into Gorotoland , that Communist arms were being secretly assembled in the highlands , and that in the past two years he had come increasingly to rely on his younger cousin ( making sure , of course , that the cousin was always wended by tribesmen absolutely loyal to himself ) , who had accepted Mosoonv 's invitation and had spent three years in Russia . At Harvard , where he audited a number of classes and participated in a ? umber of forums and other intellectual exercises concerning emergent Africa , he found himself looked to as an authority both on what should be done there and in the United States as well .

He w ade his statements suitably fervent and solemn , and was given much atOption as a youthful symbol of the wave of independence and dawning plaice that was racing across Africa and finding many echoes at the lunch minters and campuses of America . And this reputation , he thought contemptuously now , he still retained as  | *  | An exaggerated expression of surprise came over the M'Bulu 's face , folkwed by a broad smile . " Well , Mr. Chairman , if Her Majesty 's Government really think outworn charges about Communism will delay this vote on freedom for Gorotolmd , I think they are mistaken . Why is it , Mr. Chairman , that everyape  --  everyone in the West who wishes to stop the forward march of peoples always  --  always  --  tries to scare the world with Communism ?

" And with a flourish of his gleaming robes he stalked from the rostrum without another glance at the British Ambassador , who seemed for a second , but only a second , at a loss . " Very well , Mr. Chairman , " he said matter-of-factly , " I wonder if the Ambassador of Panama would read his resolution to us , so that we may all hear b again before we vote , bearing in mind the question I have just put to His Highness , which is based on very well-authenticated information reaching Ilcr Majesty 's Government from very reliable sources within Gorotoland .

" Claude Maudulayne nodded other grimly and tore up the note . " Whereas , " the Yugoslav delegate said in his thick but recognizable English , " it is the legitimate desire of all colonial peoples to achieve independence , and , " Whereas , it is the purpose of the United Nations to encourage and support all such legitimate aspirations of all colonial peoples everywhere , and , " Whereas , it is the intention of the United Nations , furthermore , that all dates should speed the easing of racial tensions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?

" The Asian , and Africans would n't permit any further change . Be thankful for small favors . " " And , whereas the Territory of Gorotoland is the outstanding area at the moment where these purposes may be achieved most speedily , " Now , therefore , it is the recommendation of the General Assembly that the United Nations do all in its power to persuade the United Kingdom ta grant immediate independence to the Territory of Gorotoland .

Ahead of me lies my delightful visit to the southern United States , my dinner at the White House , my reception at Her Majesty 's Embassy , the chance to renew old acquaintances and make new friends for Corotoland .

" " All caused by me ? " the M'Bulu asked coyly . The Secretary smiled at the attentive press . " You do love to be the center of things , do n't you ? No , not entirely by you . There are other things that concern the government of the United States . " " Ah , " said Terry . " But none more important , surely . " And in this , as the Secretary of State was to reflect in glum retrospect two days later , the M'Bulu was to be proven entirely correct . 5 The crowded elevator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sudanese , a Cypriote , two French correspondents , three American correspondents , a graying secretary from the Economic and Social Council , and she junior United States Senator from Iowa stepped off . The others rapidly found their luncheon companions and dispersed from the humming little entryway to the Delegates ' Dining Room , but the Senator paused a moment to watch the hubbub of arrivals , greetings , handshakes , and exclamations in half a hundred tongues before wandering to the reservations desk to get his table number . " Senator Smith of the United States , " he said with the intimately boyish pin that always fluttered feminine hearts , and the large Brunhilde behind the desk , true to her sex , gave a pleased titter and obediently skimmed through her reservation book with a swiftly ingratiating pencil . " Table 47 , Senator Smits , " she informed him with a dazzling display of teeth , and Lafe Smith reached over and patted her on the cheek . " I can always count on you , ca n't I ? "  | " Oh , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for all you know , " the Ienator from Iowa said . He frowned . " About as pure as my wife . But that 's *pother story . How was Fifth Committee ? Are the administrative and budget natures still after poor old Uncle Sam ? " " Always . Why do n't we wait for a minute and see if Orrin comes up ? " " O.K. I 'll ask Miss Fluoristan of 1896 to give us a table for four . " " I 'll ask her . You 've titillated the poor girl enough for one day . " " Titillated ! " Lafe Smith repeated dreamily . " What an obscene , delightful word . Ca n't you just see me with my naked hands around her naked  --  and ? y naked  --  and her naked  --  and ? " " All right , " Hal Fry said hastily . " Save that for the next time Tashikov sakes a speech in the Assembly and I need something to keep me awake . Not here . I 'll be back in a second .

" Their errands completed , they met again by the entrance to the blueutd-white dining room just as the Secretary of State and the British Ambasodor came out of the elevator and moved to the reservation desk . Hal hailed them , and in a moment they were on their way in together . By doing a little luick reshuffling that would a few minutes later badly upset four lady members of the Friends of the United Nations of Pipestone , Minnesota , Miss uuoristan had managed to give them the prize table that sits in the northt corner of the great glass-walled room looking straight up the East River the Queensborough Bridge and beyond . The gentle autumn haze had d a little ; the sun was bright and almost hot upon the river , ruffled by eshening breeze .

I think we ought to make more of a fuss over him . The poor guy needs help . " " We do as much as we can , do n't we ? " the Secretary asked . " Without making it too obvious . We ca n't afford to court the charge that he 's an American stooge . " " There is n't a charge in the world that we try to avoid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't make anyway . So why should we worry what they say ? I think we ought to work with him more closely , too . " " I do n't think he 'll do it , " Orrin Knox said . " Oh , he 'll lunch with us , I 'm sure . But look at him now . He would n't be any more relaxed or communicative than he 's being with them . " And indeed it did appear to many eyes around the room that the SecretaryGeneral was not entirely at ease in his present company . This was correct , for be was not . He found himself , in fact , wondering with some asperity how it was that his host the Soviet Ambassador could always succeed in placing him at a disadvantage , and concluded that it was by exactly the same means that the Communists used to put everyone at a disadvantage : simply by talelug the forms of polite and civilized custom and twisting them around with Samplete selfishness and ruthless inconsideration to serve their own ends . A cheon invitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sition did not normally turn down without a valid excuse if he were in ew York : so all Tashikov had to do was ask . And then all he had to do was pctend the invitation to the heir to Gorotoland , and there were the three of em in the eye of the world , obviously in cahoots and crowing about the dote in First Committee . Such , at any rate , was the exact impression he knew the Soviet Ambassador Wanted to give when he had ordered champagne and started the luncheon ' th a toast . The toast had been only the standard " To peace ! " but when he reed them to clink glasses with a big , obvious gesture and then grinned umphantly around the dining room , it was obvious to everyone that they re saluting Terry 's triumph . Particularly when that exuberant young man d gulped down his drink , refilled his glass , and gulped that down , too , with sunny smile upon the world . For him , at least , there was no subterfuge ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , " this is a wonderful day for my people . And indeed for all people like us , do n't you think ? " The Secretary-General stiffened slightly at this reference to their mutual nor and responded with a circumspect courtesy .  | page deleted  | It is n't anything , " Hal Fry said with some annoyance . " What ? " Lafe asked in concern . The Senator from West Virginia looked even more annoyed . " Now here 's Orrin making a federal case of it . I 'm just having a little blurting of vision , a little reddish thing . Very temporary . Nothing serious . It 's only happened twice ? " " In twenty-four hours , " the Secretary of State said . " I saw you blink just pow. " " ? and it 's just a little tiredness . Maybe I will lie down , but only for a little While . " " Let me take you to the doctor 's office , " Lafe suggested . " That would be an even better excuse than cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . " No , do n't tell me . It can only be one of the nurses . " " Raoul was telling me yesterday that the delegate from Senegal describes you as ' le chasseur formidable , " Lord Maudulayne said . " You 're the envy of the entire UN . " " I do n't really deserve it , you know , " Lafe said . " No , really I do n't , " he repeated when they all laughed . " But I suppose it gives people something to ssip about in the Lounge . . . Well , let 's be off . Fourth Committee 's going ck at three and I want to run across the street to delegation headquarters and check my Washington mail before the meeting starts . " " I 'll come with you , " Hal said . " Rest , " Orrin told him . " Call Harley , " Hal replied . " You worry about the cares of the world and I'Il worry about me .

" You know that fatherly manner Harley 's developed lately . Terry will be charmed to pieces and all will be well . " And as he turned at the door to give a cheerful farewell wave to the glittering M'Bulu , who waved cheerfully back , he actually believed it . " What I ca n't understand , " the St. Louis Post-Dispatch remarked rather purly as the Washington press corps drifted into the New State Department auditorium , " is why this press conference was called three hours early . " " I suspect the President 's going to take off for the Upper Peninsula of  | Michigan tonight , " the Houston Post said . " The word is n't out officially yet , but I understand he wants to spend a few days up there in the back woods . " " Oh , God , " the Washington Star said with a groan . " More roughing It around the campfire for America 's Finest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish , " said the Baltimore Sun . " Anyway , let the great man have his fun . He has a tough job . It says here . " " Oh , it is , " the Arkansas Gazette agreed . " Nobody said it was n't . " " I still think Governor Jason could do it better , " the Herald Tribune said . " What 's this thing the Jason Foundation 's throwing for that African gook ? " the Memphis Commercial Appeal inquired . " I understand they 're going In serve white man Bordelaise . You boys better stay away from there . " " Only bureau chiefs and columnists got invited , " the Philadelphia I , quirer said . " You do n't suppose they 'll be eaten , do you ?

Before him in tin auditorium he saw some two hundred members of the press corps in vario i stages of alertness , in back of them and on the sides the waiting television cameras . What he had begun by referring to as " my weekly ordeal " and had now come to regard as " my weekly picnic " was about to begin . He had n't much for them this time , but if he knew the press corps they 'd develop something before the senior wire-service man put an end to it by crying , " Thank you , Mr. President ! " and they risked life and limb racing for tit ( telephones . " I really have n't much today , " he said . " The Ambassador of the Ivor Coast presented his credentials this morning . I had a short talk with the Ambassador of Rumania on a possible food grant there . The head of the World Bank and I had a short talk on the world economic situation , and th ( Secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Labor Department is releasing those figures later this afternoon .

" " Please do , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the delegate of Guinea to NBC with an air of deepest injury , " the President knows what he wishes to do . But it is a distinct shock to us . We are indignant and horrified . "  | " If the President had deliberately set out to insult the entire Afro-Asian world , " the delegate of the United Arab Republic said sternly to Par ; , Match , " I do not see how he could have done a better job . I am surprised and disappointed . " " We are disappointed , " said the delegate of Ghana . " We are not surprised . " " I should hardly think it would be well received in Africa , " the French Ambassador said , " but that is the President 's problem . " " It might perhaps have been better to do as His Highness desired , " sa it I the Ambassador of the Argentine , " but we would not wish to enter into matter that is between the United States and the African states . " " It is typical Yankee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am puzzled by his decision , " the Indian Ambassador observed cautiousl to CBS , " but I would wish to study it further before saying anything about it . " " A bit thick , under the circumstances , was n't it ? " asked the Canadian delegate cheerfully . " As Africans , " said the delegate of Mali to the Daily Mail , who noddc ( I vigorous agreement , " we are personally affronted . I think we can promise y o there will be the gravest consequences . " " Oh , no , " said the British Ambassador with a bland expression that did n't quite come off , " I would n't want to make any comment at all . " " Oh , no ! " said the M'Bulu of Mbuele with a sunny smile . " I would n't want to make any comment at all ! " " It 's my fault , " the Secretary of State said . " I should have tried to rear l you earlier , but I just assumed you were having your press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course I just assumed that everything was in order up there , " ti ? President said with a trace of annoyance in his tone . The Secretary glance I across First Avenue at the green and silver shaft of the Secretariat Buildint caught now by the slanting golden rays of the late-afternoon sun , anti laughed rather grimly . " Nothing is ever in order up here . Particularly with everybody in Afric  | big as life and twice as self-important . I do n't think that reference to little character ' was especially fortunate . " " It was n't . But I knew how I meant it , and the press knew how I meant " ? but the world did n't , " Orrin said . " Or , anyway , a good portion of the world is pretending it did n't to suit its own devious purposes . " " Why are they such chintzy souls all the time ? " the President asked in mild wonderment . " They know perfectly well ? " " It 's like Alice in Wonderland . They do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , except to embarrass us . That 's the great game in the world , you we . We 're out front , so we 're fair target . That 's for the jealous and spiteful ones . For those who really want to tear us down , of course , the game is less frivolous and lighthearted . " " Do you know where the line is that separates the two ? " the President inquired dryly . The Secretary snorted . " It 's a little difficult to find , in some areas . I do think it would be wise to modify your plans somewhat . I ran into Raoul Barre just before I came across the street and he said he has already found great consternation and excitement among the former French colonies . Apparently they still come running to him with their troubles up here , and he thinks you would be well advised to think of some graceful excuse and change your plans . " " Oh , for heaven 's sake , " the President said in a tone of disgust . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be at the beck and call of every little two-bit international scalawag who wants to hold a gun at my head ? It 's blackmail . " " Sure , " Orrin Knox said cheerfully , " that 's exactly what it is . And everybody knows it . The most delightfully cynical double life goes on up here all the time about almost everything . Of a political nature , anyway . " " Now , Orrin , " the President said . " God knows I do n't have much side to me , but I do have some concept of the dignity of my office , and I ca n't let it appear that Terence Ajkaje is leading it around on a string . It 's beneath the office . It 's beneath the United States . " " That , " said the Secretary of State , " is exactly the point Raoul was making , In an indirect way . He 's not so sure it is . " " Have we fallen that low ? " the President demanded . " I do n't believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But ? " " And , furthermore , I must say all this hardly sounds like you . What 's become of the fearless fighting Senator from Illinois ? I thought I was appointing a Secretary of State with some starch in his soul . " " Now , Harley , " the Secretary said sharply , " you know that is n't fair . "  | " Well , " the President conceded , " you 're right ; it is n't . I apologize . But it does seem to me ? " " God knows I 'd like to tell the little worm to go to hell , " Orrin said , " but , you see , he is n't a little worm in the eyes of his fellow Africans , the prey , and the New York cocktail circuit . Or if he is , they 're doing an awful ! ) good job of keeping it quiet . He floats around this place on a wave ul favorable publicity that has n't been matched since Castro spoke to the newspaper editors . He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It does n't make any difference that he 's really the exact opposite . it 's the public image that counts , and I must say the public image is crowned with laurel and ten feet high . " " Even so , " the President said with a stubborn note that his Cabinet had come to recognize , " I am afraid I ca n't possibly change my plans for him . " " Raoul suggested that perhaps you could say that last-minute legislation needed your attention , so you had decided to put off the fishing trip until next week ? " " There is n't anything that ca n't wait to be signed until I get back . " " ? and then you could arrange to have possibly just a small buffet at the White House , " Orrin went on calmly , " with perhaps the members of Foreign Relations and Foreign Affairs committees and a few of the top correspondent , so he can get the publicity he wants ? " " I said I 'm not changing my plans . Now , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Raoul does , " the Secretary said earnestly , " that perhaps under the circumstances it would be best to find a good excuse and do it . The world does n't deal in realities any more , you know ; it deals in public fictions . " " I know . And I am determined that the public fiction about the Unites I States will be that it does not yield to every little passing wind of hysteria that blows . Have n't I made that clear already , at Geneva and elsewhere ? " " You have done beautifully , " the Secretary of State said soberly , " and , like you , I think the public fiction will coincide most closely with reality if that is the picture of us you can educate the world to accept . But there is a genuine feeling up here that we must take into account . And in that context ? " " I know what it is , " the President said . " It 's a feeling of blown-up ego that has the whole world out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United Nations has been to give unimportant little states nobody would ever have heard of a chance to inflate themselves out of all proportion to their 1 actual weight in things . It 's ridiculous that we let the tail swing the cat the I 'll way we do . " " But you understand why it is , " Orrin Knox suggested . The President sighed .  | " Yes , I understand why it is . The more real power you have , the less you afford to exercise it , and the less real power you have , the more you can w it around . It 's a sign of how topsy-turvy our world is . " " So you do think perhaps , then , that you can ? " the Secretary began , and its conscious at once of a change of atmosphere at the other end of the line . " No , indeed , " the President said crisply . " This is one of those times I feel k wo n't do to give in . " " I 'd rather do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Orrin observed . " I ca n't conceive of any situation in which we 'd have to later . ' Anyway , Ted Jason and his little luncheon in Charleston ought to give him all the beadlines he wants . " " LeGage Shelby wo n't be happy , either , " the Secretary told him with an Ionic amusement . " LeGage Shelby is the least of my worries . Are you coming back down might ? " " Yes , I think so . I do n't feel I can be away from the department more than t couple of days without a lot of things getting out from under me . Not that they do n't when I 'm there , of course ; but I feel better about it when I 'm on the spot . At least I can prevent some of it . " " Now , surely , " the President said with a mocking irony that exactly mimicked some other voices of the past , " you do n't think that some obscure little clerk in some obscure little bureau lost China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obscure little bureaus can do a hell of a lot of image in a government like this , and it 's either naive or disingenuous to my they ca n't . However , it 's more a matter of good administration that I 'm lOncerned with . So , I 'll be back in town late tonight if you want to reach me before you go to Michigan . " " I 'm going to Michigan at six . Do you and Beth like trout ? " " Love ' em . " " I 'll bring you a dozen . And , of course , you can always reach me through the White House switchboard if you need me . " " Sure thing , " Orrin Knox said . " Have a good rest . You deserve it . " " Thanks , " said the President . " I will . " And that , the Secretary thought as he returned the direct phone to the White House to its receiver and swung back to the pile of papers that confronted him on his desk , was what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had settled into the Presidency with a sure skill that had , in the we of Geneva , risen to an instinctive brilliance . But there was still a stubkm streak , certainly not decreased by the adulation that had followed his  | actions in the Swiss city , and a certain willful blindness about things , o n , occasion . Of course Orrin could see his position that the United States must 11 , 4 be " on a string to Terence Ajkaje , " but , by the same token , the President 's press conference remark and his decision not to entertain the M'Bulu .1s already an issue and rapidly becoming more so at the UN . The episode ww ; u exactly the sort of thing that the neutralist states , encouraged by the Cons munists , loved to fret about and worry away at until it had grown to a sin ' out of all proportion to its real worth . And in this recurring and oft-repeated process , of course , the lure of a good story and a major controversy alwa 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was already top news its the New York Post and the New York World-Telegram and Sun , whose late afternoon editions were on the desk before him . " PRESIDENT SNU I ; s AFRICANS , " said the former . " HASSLE DEVELOPS ON WHI ' I l HOUSE BID TO TERRY , " said the latter . As far as he was concerned , the Secretary thought with some annoyanw e , he would love to kick the bucket over the moon along with Harley and not worry about it any more . He smiled as he recalled the President 's rema I. about his own newly found diplomacy : he certainly had become 1 diplomat since leaving the Senate . But in the democratic system each ju , l , had its own imperatives , as each had its own prerogatives and privilege and you inevitably found yourself adapting to the style of new responsibiliti ( when you took them on . It was all very well to rise and denounce somethit , . in the Senate  --  and he thought for a wistful moment of what fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just once more  --  but in the delicate area of international relation ships it was not so easy or advisable to do so . Of course the Commun i . t could , that was their stock in trade  --  but the United States could not . I I would , ironically enough , shock all those powers that watched the Soviet performances with a secret envy and approval . They would never accept it from America . It would be much too uncomfortable to have two great power acting like great powers . As long as the United States confined itself to aei rejoinders and refused to take the offensive , everybody could pretend it was n't so . He swung again to the window and stared thoughtfully across at the U N buildings against the backdrop of the darkening river and Brooklyn , not becoming dotted with early-evening lights as the day swiftly faded . On t sudden impulse he picked up a phone , had his secretary verify an appoint ment , clapped on his hat and coat , and hurried over . " You know , Seab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by sic I , in the Senate and listened with half an ear to the foreign aid debate dronit ? -  | An , " you ought to take yourself a cruise when this is over . Get away from it ill . Relax . Rejuvenate . Regain your youth . " I Iis seatmate gave a chuckle and peered at him through half-closed eyes . " Now , Bob , you know exactly where I 'm going to be doing my cruising this fall . You know exactly where , Bob . In the great state of South Carolina , Sob . That 's where . " " Things getting a little rough for you , are they ? " Bob Munson asked . " I did n't know that could ever happen to you , Seab . " The senior Senator from South Carolina chuckled . " Oh , yes , sir . Oh  --  yes  --  sir . Even to poor old beleaguered Seabright B. Cooley , servant of the people these fifty years , Bob . The little mice are Idbblin ' , Bob . They 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a sudden emphasis , ' I still know a thing or two , Bob . I 'm not through yet . Or even near it . " " What are you going to do ? " the Majority Leader asked with the impersonal curiosity of one political technician to another . " Get involved in the ace issue ? " " I 'd rather not , " Seab Cooley said soberly , " if I can avoid it , Bob . It 's bad slough at best , and I do n't want to be stirring it around . Unless they push is too hard , Bob . If they push us too hard , Bob , then you 'll hear from me . Yes , sir , you 'll surely  --  hear  --  from  --  me . " " Mmm-hmm . I expect we will . Well , we 'll try to get you out of here tomorrow night , Seab . The Speaker and I would n't want Harper Graham and those other boys to have a free hand against you one minute longer than we tin help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cooley said , hunching himself around and peering dourly over the Senate . " Where is that devious fellow , Bob ? " " I do n't see your distinguished colleague , " the Majority Leader said . " Probably on the phone to South Carolina right this minute lining up votes inst you , Seab . " " It wo n't do him any good , Bob , " Senator Cooley said calmly . " It wo n't him any good at all . " " Well , I hope not , " Senator Munson said truthfully , " but you never know . Pr . President ! " he said , jumping to his feet as Paul Hendershot of Indiana poncluded a lengthy attack on the bill . Powell Hanson of North Dakota , in e chair , gave him recognition . " Mr. President , I should like to advise enators that it is the leadership 's intention to hold the Senate in session late tonight , possibly until ten o'clock or midnight , in the hope that we can condude action on the pending measure . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California , " I think we should have a quorum call so that a majority of the Senate can hear that  | r . President , " Bob Munson said , " will the Senator yield ? Is it not the that His Highness ' country is still under British rule and he is not yet head of an independent state ? Might this not explain the President 's on ? " " I do not know what explains it , Mr. President , " said Ray Smith severely , less it is shortsightedness of the most flagrant kind . Certainly a representaof the great Negro race ? " " He 's practically terrified , " Murfee Andrews whispered to Cecil Hathaway. " ? deserves better treatment than this from the President of the United tes . How are we to hold up our heads at the United Nations , Mr. sident ? How are we to convince the African states that we are truly ' r friend ? How are we to convince the world that we mean it when we k of equal rights , equal justice , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all men ? " " Mr. President , " said the senior Senator from South Carolina with an Ominous gentleness , " will the distinguished Senator from California yield ? " " Mr. President , " Senator Smith said hastily , " I do not wish to get into an argument with the disting ? " " Oh , Mr. President , " Senator Cooley said . " Now , I do not entertain at all the idea of getting into an argument with the distinguished Senator from California in this matter . But is it not true that in Gorotoland where this F.mboohoo of Embewley ? " " M'Bulu of Mbuele , " Ray Smith corrected nervously . " Emboohoo of Embewley , " Seab Cooley repeated firmly , " lives , there is season to believe that slavery still exists ? Is it not rumored that human recrifices and even cannibalism can still be found there ? Are there not even dgns of Russian and Chinese Communist infiltration ? " " Oh , well , Mr. President , " Senator Smith said with a relieved scornfuless , " do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to trot out old charges of Communist infiltration ! Now , that is ridiculous , Mr. President . " " Is it ? " Seab Cooley asked mildly . " Well , sir , I would n't know about that . the Senator from California is much more of an expert on Communism than I am , that 's true , Mr. President . He knows much more about it than I " What does the Senator mean by that ? " Ray Smith demanded with a nerv
