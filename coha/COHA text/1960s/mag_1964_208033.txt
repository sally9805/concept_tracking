The planet Mars follows such an eccentric orbit around the sun that it is accessible to probing spacecraft from earth only one month out of every 25-a period referred to by scientists as " the window . " All through November the window was open , but the first U.S. attempt to peek inside failed when the Mariner C spacecraft , unable to jettison its 300-lb. fiber-glass protective shield , could not attain the necessary speed . <P> Last week the U.S. tried again , barely two days before the window would have slammed shut until December 1966 . <P> At Cape Kennedy a three-stage , 100-ft . Atlas-Agena rocket blasted downrange over the South Atlantic missile track in a perfect launch . Five minutes later , the protective shield , a redesigned shroud of magnesium thorium , was jettisoned right on schedule . Thirty-seven minutes after that , from a 115-mile-high parking orbit over the Indian Ocean , the rocket engine reignited , kicking the 575-lb . Mariner D payload toward Mars at the required speed-25,600 m.p.h . At week 's end all was going well with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the spacecraft still has quite a way to travel-325 million miles along a route that is expected to carry it past Mars by mid-July . <P> Mariner 's mission is manifold . During its journey away from the sun , it will radio back information on radiation , magnetic fields and micrometeorites . If all goes perfectly , it is supposed to , transmit data on the density of the Martian atmosphere that could be invaluable to U.S. scientists who are hoping to land a capsule there by 1969 . As a final dividend , it will also try to take 22 still pictures with a television camera during a 30-minute flyby some 8,600 miles from the red planet . The pictures will be transmitted to earth from 150 million miles in space , but scientists think they could be as detailed as photos of the moon taken by the strongest telescopes on earth . If they are right , new light may at last be thrown on the mystery of the Martian canals .                @ @ @ @ @
