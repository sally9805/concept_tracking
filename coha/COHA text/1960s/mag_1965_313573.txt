Now that his new metal-plating system is all polished up and promises to revolutionize many industrial processes , Physicist Donald M. Mattox of Albuquerque 's Sandia Corp . is faced with a persistent question . " People keep asking me why no one thought of it before , " he says , and he has quit trying to find an answer . His best guess is that prac tical metallurgists knew too little theory to tackle the problem , while basic research scientists , who know enough theory , were unconcerned with such practical work . <P> Hard-Hitting Ions . Mattox supplied just the right combination of theory and practicality to handle a problem that has grown as steadily as expanding modern technology . Nowadays , nearly every metal gets plated for one reason or another-for beauty , against corrosion , to guard against wear , or to reduce friction . But all too often the plating does not stick tightly enough . The substrate ( the metal to be plated ) covers itself with a film of adhering gas or oxide that can not be cleaned away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not on the underlying metal , forming a weak bond that is easily broken . <P> After detailed study , Mattox decided that all present plating methods have the same weakness : as they are applied , the atoms of plating materials do not hit the substrate hard enough . Mattox gets around this difficulty by using a chamber filled with argon gas . Inside it the piece of metal to be plated is hooked up as the cathode ( negative pole ) of an electrical circuit . The plating material forms the anode ( positive pole ) . When a high-voltage direct current is passed through the circuit , positive argon ions fly across the gap and smack the substrate so hard that they blast it clear of gas or oxide . <P> Dug-ln Atoms . Since argon is an inert gas , its ions do not stick . But when Mattox heats the anode , the plating material begins to evaporate . Its own ions jump the gap and stick fast to the perfectly clean substrate . The coating that results adheres as strongly as if it were part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his method has a great future in space-age construction that calls for the coating of such exotic metals as molybdenum and uranium that other plating systems can not handle . The Mattox method can even plate the brittle ceramic parts essential to giant modern missiles and miniaturized computers-giving them such stick-tight coatings that they can be handled like metal components and joined together by brazing or soldering.
