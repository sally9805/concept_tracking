txt Senator Thomas J. Dodd , in a vigorous and at times emotional speech on the floor of the Senate , defended himself today against charges that he ' had diverted campaign contributions to his personal use . " I have not enriched myself Ifrom public office , " he declared . The speech came just ? three days before the Senate ethics committee is scheduled to begin public hearings on the Connecticut Democrat 's financial affairs , including his use of campaign funds raised on . his behalf from 1961 to 1965 . Mr. Dodd , appearing tired but defiant , spoke to a nearly empty Senate chamber and a small gallery audience that included his wife . Aides said that he had stayed up until 5:30 this morning revising his text . ' Weary of Press Abuse ' The speech , which broke a year of silence , contained not only a defense of his own conduct but also a bitter denunciation of what he called his " trial by press . " His principal targets were Drew Pearson and Jack Anderson , the columnists who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and The New York Times , which published several articles last year reporting on allegations that the Senator had collected twice for expenses for traveling for Senate subcommittees . " I have thus far kept silent about the allegations that have been made against me in the press out of deference to the Senate ethics committee , " Mr. Dodd said . " But I am weary of press abuse , and I have now come to the conclusion that I must break // my self imposed silence and speak out because the endless repetition of the false allegations against me by certain columnists and certain influential newspapers has created a climate in which some people may be inclined to presume me guilty , even in advance of hearing what I have to say in my own defense and in advance of any finding by the Senate ethics committee . " To support his assertion that he had not profited from public office , Mr. Dodd released a financial statement putting his net worth , as of Feb. 15 , at $53,979 . His assets of $188,616 consisted mainly of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other in Connecticut -- and the cash surrender value of a life insurance policy . His liabilities of $134,637 consisted of $87,470 in outstanding mortgages on the two homes and $47,167 in expenses payable " in connection with the Senate ethics committee investigation and pending litigation . " The litigation involves a $2-million libel suit against Mr. Anderson and Mr. Pearson . " I have always known , " Mr. Dodd said , " that my net . worth would reveal me as one of the poorer members of Congress . " The main issue before the ethics committee  --  formally the Senate Select Committee on Standards and Conduct  --  will be charges by Mr. Anderson and Mr. Pearson that the Senator not only diverted part of the proceeds from a series of testimonial dinners to his own use but also violated the law by failing to report this money on his income tax returns . Under present tax laws , political contributions are not taxable unless diverted to personal use , in which case they are taxable as ordinary income . Mr. Dodd , in his speech this morning , conceded that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and expenses , most of which were accumulated , he declared , during his unsuccessful campaign for the Senate in 1956 and his successful campaign in 1958 . He placed the total proceeds from the testimonials at $170 , - 000 . Of this , he said , $140,000 went to pay off political debts dating from 1956 . He did not say in his speech what happened to the other $30,000 ; but in a press release accompanying the speech , the Senator stated that " what was left was far exceeded by the cost of political office over an eight-year period . " Heart of the Issue However , the Senator insisted that he did not have to report any of these funds on his inMine tax returns because the money constituted a tax free gift . This insistence on the tax free status of the funds raised at the testimonials lay at the heart of Mr. Dodd 's defense . For if the purchase price of the tickets to the dinners was intended as a gift from Mr. Dodd 's friends and supporters , then , under existing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Senator argued vigorously that the purchasers of the tickets  --  whom Mr. Dodd regards as donors rather than political contributors  --  knew exactly what they were doing . " So far as I know , " he declared , " no donor has challenged the fact that the 1961 , 1963 , and 1965 fund-raising events were testimonials , that is noncampaign fund-raising events . " However , the charge has been made by people who have not attended these events that the donors were led to believe that they were contributing to my campaign fund . " To this very moment , not , one single donor who has contributed to these functions ha : ever contended that they thought they were contributing to my campaign . " Mr. Dodd then offered to re ? turn the money raised at the dinners to any person " whc came under the mistaken impression that it was for my campaign fund . " " I will return their money immediately if they were thus misled , " he added . " And if my personal means should not prove adequate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay the claims which may be made in response to this statement . " Boyd Questions Figures A sharp rebuttal to Mr. Dodd 's calculations came from James P. Boyd , the Senator 's former administrative assistant and the leader of the group of employes who took documents from Mr. Dodd 's files . Mr. Boyd said that the Senator collected more than $500 , - 000 between November , 1961 , and March , 1965 , and spent less than $200,000 of that on political expenses . He did not deal with Mr. Dodd 's contention that the money received was tax free . Mr. Dodd also dealt with allegations that on several occasions he had submitted two bills for travel expenses  --  one to an organization that had invited him to speak , in his capacity as chairman of the Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency or as vice chairman of the Subcommitee on Internal Security , and a second to the Senate . He began by conceding that on seven occasions he had billed both the Government and private organizations for the same trips . He said the double @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the travel fee had been paid either by the Government or by the private organization . Refunds Held Due However , he said the doublebilling had been the fault of his former office manager , Michael V. O'Hare and said that " O'Hare was probably one of the most inefficient and sloppy bookkeepers who ever lived . " In fact , he said , Mr. O'Hare had failed to get him refunds he was due for 21 trips to Connecticut . He added that by subtracting the cost of the Connecticut trips from " the cost of the so-called double billing trips , I would owe the Government a balance of $384.24 . " Mr. Dodd said that a series of articles that appeared in The New York Times last year dealing with what he called " alleged instances of deliberate double billing " constituted " one of the more glaring examples " of the " trial by press " to which he said he had been exposed . The Senator said : " Some time before he embarked on the series of pretended expos ? s , E. W. Kenworth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a confidential conversation with one of my assistants . He told my assistant that The Times head office had been after the Washington office to get in on the Pearson-Anderson attacks on Dodd , but that the Washington office had been rejecting this pressure , first because they'had no use for Pearson and Anderson and second because The New York Times did not believe in using stolen documents . " Apparently the pressure of the head office ultimately prevailed . Before it was all over , The New York Times had stooped to the use of stolen documents in the hands of known liars and admitted thieves . " What the New York charges boiled down to was that I had in a number of instances billed the same trip to Senate coinmittees and to organizations under whose auspices I was speaking . " Dodd Called Responsible Mr. O'Hare , one of the main targets of Mr : Dodd 's address , was not reachable for comment today . However , when Mr. Dodd leveled similar charges of administrative inefficiency against him earlier this year , Mr. O'Hare replied that any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As part of his general accusation that he had been unfairly tried by the press before having his own day in court , Mr. Dodd also criticized The Hartford Courant for " an editorial charging me with triple billings " ; The New York Times for referring editorially to " the astonishing affairs of Senator Dodd " ; Stewart Alsop for an article in a recent issue of The Saturday Evening Post linking in the same sentence . Mr. Dodd , Representative Adam Clayton Powell , Manhattan Democrat who has been excluded from the House ; and Robert G. Baker , former secretary to the Senate Democratic majority ; and James Reston , columnist for The New York Times , for a similar violation . Mr. Baker was convicted on Jan. 29 of income tax evasion , theft and conspiracy to defraud the Government . Quote From Reston Mr. Dodd quoted with disapproval the following passage from Mr. Reston 's column of Feb. 26 : " Bobby Baker , Adam Clayton Powell , Senator Dodd , all had their day but they were caught . The legal system trapped Baker , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bar of the Congress . " Much of the Senator 's speech was devoted to an angry attack on a group of his former ern ? ployes who admitted , in earlier hearings before the ethics com ? mittee , that they had taken records from the Senator 's and given copies to Mr. Pearson and Mr. Anderson . In addition to Mr. O'Hare and Mr. Boyd , the group included Mrs. Marjorie A. Carpenter , who once served as the Senator 's secretary . Mr. Dodd accused the two columnists of participating in a " conspiracy " with his former employes to steal his documents , some of which he said were classified , and use them " in a campaign to destroy , my public reputation . " He demanded to know why the Justice Department had not prosecuted those involved in the enterprise . " What is at stake in a still larger sense , " he asserted , " is the national security , because there is no Senator whose files do not contain confidential and secret documents relating to his various committee activities .
