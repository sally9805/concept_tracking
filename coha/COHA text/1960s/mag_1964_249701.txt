Heeding a piercing and highly public appeal for help from Archbishop Makarios , Nikita Khrushchev duly pledged Russian aid should anyone ( read Turkey ) invade Cyprus . But Khrushchev also called for moderation and warned Makarios to lift his economic blockade of the Turkish Cypriots . Still , even the remote prospect of direct Russian intervention seemed a little chilling to all sides . <P> President Johnson fired off messages to Athens and Ankara , once again urging Premiers George Papandreou and Ismet Inonu to settle the Cyprus problem and unite before the common Red enemy . Implicit , at least , seemed to be a threat that the U.S. can not maintain aid to supposed NATO allies if they use U.S.-supplied arms against each other . <P> Tempers calmed slightly in Athens and Ankara . Turkey made the gesture of returning to NATO control the U.S.-built planes it had used to bomb and strafe Cyprus . Greece , which had also withdrawn units from NATO , followed suit . Cyprus itself had a breather . Though still calling down curses on Turkey for its recent air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turkish Cypriot communities . For the first time in two weeks , running water was restored to the huddled refugees in Ktima , and badly needed fuel was delivered to Turkish Cypriot bakeries in Nicosia . <P> The U.N . peace-keeping force took a few aggressive steps . U.N . posts , manned by Swedish troops , were set up between the lines of the Turkish Cypriot defenders of Kokkina and the Greek Cypriot besiegers on the mountainside . Canadian , Finnish and Danish U.N . troops , moving forward with the bayonet , dismantled Turkish Cypriot gun positions that menaced a U.N . headquarters near Nicosia . <P> Even though the U.N . mediator , Finland 's Sakari Tuomioja , suffered a stroke , negotiations in Geneva continued . Greek and Turkish representatives in Geneva pored over a plan , proposed by U.S. Special Envoy Dean Acheson , which apparently envisages a union of Cyprus with Greece ( enosis ) , with special guarantees for the Turkish Cypriots and a permanent Turkish base on the island . Given suitable face-saving devices , Turkey and Greece might accept . The same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a loud advocate of enosis but now seems to enjoy being head of a sovereign state .
