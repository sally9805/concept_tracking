Oxford 's Sir Kenneth Clark respects and admires the faceless art of abstract expressionism , but he does not think it will be around forever . At Wellesley last week , he prophesied : " The imitation of external reality is a fundamental human instinct which is bound to reassert itself . " To prove his point . Sir Kenneth talked about two kinds of painters-apes and children-whom the crudest of critics like to lump with the abstract expressionists . <P> " Apes take their painting seriously , " said Sir Kenneth seriously . " The patterns they produce are not the result of mere accident but of intense , if short-lived concentration and a lively sense of balance and space-filling . If you compare the painting of a young ape with that of a human child of relatively the same age , you will find that in the first , expressive , patternmaking stage , the ape is superior . <P> Then , inexorably , the child begins to paint things-man , house , truck , etc . This the ape never does . " He does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record what he sees . If the desire to represent external reality reflects the loftier idea of " the formation of concepts , which are then modified by visual sensation , " the image is bound to return . " For I consider the human faculty of forming concepts at least as inalienable as life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness . " <P> Aside from this instinct , added Sir Kenneth , " it is an incontrovertible fact of history that the greatest art has always been about something , a means of communicating some truth which is assumed to be more important than the art itself . The truths which art has been able to communicate have been of a kind which could not be put in any other way . They have been ultimate truths , stated symbolically . " Until the need for such communication is felt again , " the visual arts will fall short of the greatest epochs , the ages of the Parthenon , the Sistine Ceiling and Chartres Cathedral .
