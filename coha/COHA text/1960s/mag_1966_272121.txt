The World Cup-a buxom , foot-tall lady hefting an octagonal bowl on her shoulders-is probably the world 's least artistic trophy . Without a doubt , it is the most coveted . For the unlovely lady is symbolic of supremacy in the world 's most popular sport , football-or soccer , as it is known in the U.S. This week , as the teams move into the final contests for the World Cup , the world is gripped by perhaps the most severe case of football fever in history . <P> The quadrennial matches are being held this time in Britain , where modern football originated 103 years ago . It has been quite a homecoming . Some 2,500,000 people , including 35,000 foreigners , will have witnessed one or more of the 32 games before the final match in London late this week . Fans who could not come to Britain have kept abreast with play-by-play accounts from 700 radio and TV broadcasters and 1,600 reporters . Thanks to a worldwide satellite hookup , the final game will probably be witnessed on television by no fewer than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began fortnight ago with 16 national teams in the running . By late last week , the only teams with a hope of victory were Britain , Portugal , the Soviet Union and West Germany . To the despair of their supporters , the others had fallen to noisy defeat . The loudest wails came from Brazil , whose team had won the cup in 1958 and 1962 . A loss to Portugal became a nationwide calamity . From office buildings in Rio and Sao Paulo , clouds of black carbon paper and typewriter ribbon cascaded onto the streets below ; flags were lowered to half-mast , and people wept in public . <P> Italians were equally bitter when their highly rated team was knocked out of the race by the tournament 's lowest-rated contenders , the North Koreans . Rome 's Corriere Dello Sport ran a one-word headline : SHAME ! In Parliament , a neo-Fascist deputy pointed to Italy 's defeat as the sign that a new Duce was needed to rescue the nation 's fading honor . <P> Teutonic Intensity . The West Germans ' victory in 1954 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreements combined . Hoping to become Weltmeister again , the Germans are following the matches with Teutonic intensity . Some have bought a second TV set in case one should fail , spurred perhaps by the tragic case of a 33-year-old leatherworker who hanged himself at his home near Frankfurt after his set went on the blink during one of the opening games . <P> Portugal is seized by excitement . During the matches , the streets in Portuguese towns are deserted : everyone huddles near radios or TV sets . Last week 's victory over North Korea paralyzed downtown Lisbon as fans , waving flags and shouting " Viva O Portugal ! " , snake danced through the streets . <P> The nation that perhaps yearns most for victory is Britain . With the country 's economy in a mess and Prime Minister Harold Wilson under fire , what Britons long for is to be supreme once more in something . " Please , please , England , win , " cries a fan in a London newspaper cartoon , " if only to take my mind off the pound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
