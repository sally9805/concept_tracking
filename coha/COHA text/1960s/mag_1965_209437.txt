LA BATARDE by Violette Leduc. 488 pages . Farrar , Straus &; Giroux. $6.95 . <P> Violette Leduc is 58 and , by her own admission , illegitimate , ugly and homosexual . She has managed to put all these dubious assets to some use : she is a writer of autobiographies , of which La Btarde , her fifth , was a considerable success in existential circles . It is a success based not on wit , wisdom or literary grace but on the unpleasant pleasure many people find in watching someone else behave shamelessly . Violette Leduc , shameless to the point of masochism , confesses to her greed and petty thievery , her gluttony , her love of begging and pleading , her torturing of others , her self-obsessive use of sex . " Violette Leduc weeps , exults , and trembles with her ovaries , " writes Simone de Beauvoir in her introduction . Ovaries may not be exactly the word , but there is plenty of weeping and trembling . <P> <P> THE SYSTEM OF DANTE 'S HELL by LeRoi Jones . 154 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a beard , a gigantic grievance collection , and a notion that he is the Jonathan Swift of the Ne gro revolution . But Swift 's excremental visions were elaborated by his intellect ; Jones 's explosive expressions proceed from a simpler impulse . In The Toilet , his most effective play , the action transpires in a latrine . And in this book , described on the dust jacket as an autobiography , he announces aggressively : " This thing , if you read it , will jam your face in my - . " It will indeed . On almost every page , Author Jones , who is now 31 years old , makes reference to evacuation-generally to some form of erotic evacuation . The filth is rationalized as social protest and enshrined in religious allegory : Jones explicitly identifies himself with Dante ( " Dante , me " ) and describes his life as a Dantesque descent into a hell called America , in which the devil is a white man and his victims are all Negroes named LeRoi Jones . <P> <P> CORK STREET , NEXT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pages . Scribner's. $4.95 . <P> Pamela Hansford Johnson is the wife of C. P. Snow , and a novelist in her own right-mostly on the light side . In her present book , she lampoons pop culture , black comedy , lady poetasters and the criminal mind .
