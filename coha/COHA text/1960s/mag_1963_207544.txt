D for Disinterested <P> MATTHEW ARNOLD-LECTURES &; ESSAYS IN CRITICISM ( 578 pp. ) - Vol . Ill in a ten-volume series edited by R. H. Super - University of Michigan ( $9 ) . <P> " Sweetness and light " was not the best of phrases even in Victorian times . Besides , Matthew Arnold had borrowed it from Jonathan Swift . But the eminent Victorian poet-critic 's oft-quoted formula for mental harmony has clung to his reputation like a sugary burr . Successive generations of collegians , coming upon it in more modern times , have turned away , convinced that Arnold 's comments on the world are about as relevant to the tough-minded 20th century as those , say , of Harriet Beecher Stowe . <P> This is a pity .

Arnold often indulged in levity that disturbed the specific gravity of fellow Victorians-and led to a cartoon by irreverent Max Beerbohm ( see cut ' ) mocking them both .

He foresaw that the 19th century 's grim but necessary preoccupation with industrial growth would pass away , and a time would come " when man has made himself perfectly comfortable and has ... to determine what to do with himself . " To provide a standard for that coming day , he proposed to seek out and proclaim " the best that has been known and thought in the world . "
