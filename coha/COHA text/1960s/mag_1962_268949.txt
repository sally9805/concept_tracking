A chill rain whipped Rue Desfontaines at noon one day last week as a carload of plainclothes police pulled up at No. 25 . The six-story building was barely distinguishable from dozens of other new , white apartment houses in the middle-class European quarter of Algiers-even to the crudely painted SALAN across one wall . But the plainclothesmen had made no mistake . Minutes later , they were inside a three-room , ground-floor apartment , their service revolvers leveled at ex-General Raoul Salan . In the heart of the city where his men boasted of being " as safe as fish in the sea , " almost one year to the day since his arrival in Algiers to take part in the abortive Generals ' Revolt , the head of the murderous Secret Army Organization had been captured at last . Said one jubilant gendarme : " He fell into the trap like a beginner . " <P> The arrest was like a scene from a Simenon thriller . From informers ' tips and details gleaned from a captured S.A.O . leader , special teams of security police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour-to-hour movements , decided the best chance of taking him alive would be to catch him on an unguarded visit to Rue Desfontaines , one of many hideouts used by his wife Babiche and daughter ( who were also arrested ) . After patient weeks of waiting , police learned that Salan was going to spend Easter weekend with his family , burst into the apartment before he had even removed his hat . <P> Shock for a Concierge . Pale , black-mustached , his silver hair dyed black , blue-suited Salan , 62 , looked like a typical Paris businessman , which he claimed to be . From behind the desk where he was seated when they arrived , he wordlessly handed a police inspector an identity card in the name of Louis Carriere . ( Methodical Raoul Salan took the name from the Paris street where he once lived . ) After a studied silence , the cop pointed his revolver at the general 's chest , drawled : " You are Salan . " <P> Captured in the apartment with Salan was his aide , former Captain Jean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came with him to Algiers for the April putsch . As police bundled them outside , one cop could not help identifying their catch to other residents in the hallway . When the concierge heard that M. Carriere was Raoul Salan , she fainted . Silent and deathly pale , Salan was taken with Ferrandi by helicopter to Reghai'a , French military headquarters 20 miles from town , where the S.A.O . chief huddled bleakly on a bench between two gendarmes . There he was spotted by an old comrade-in-arms , loyal Gaullist Gen eral Charles Ailleret , who was relieved last week as Algerian commander in chief . " You know who I am , " barked Ailleret . " You are responsible for all the crimes committed by the S.A.O . in your name . " Clenching and unclenching his hands , Salan stared silently at the floor .
