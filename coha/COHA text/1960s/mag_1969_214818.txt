For 17 years , CBS has been trying to find a worthy contender for NBC 's Today show . Veterans and beginners were thrown into the 7-9 a.m. time slot : Walter Cronkite , Dick Van Dyke , Mike Wallace , Will Rogers Jr. , Jimmy Dean . The only stayer was a kiddie show , Captain Kangaroo . Finally , CBS limited itself to a half-hour Morning News , which concentrated on national and foreign affairs . <P> Now CBS has once again entered the lists by revamping the Morning <P> News . The show , for which some 168 stations have been lined up ( compared with Today 's 195 ) , now lasts a full hour and is called CBS Morning News with Joseph Benti . The format eschews such Today specialties as book plugs , chitchat among the cast , skits from upcoming musicals and reviews . It generally sticks to newscasting by Benti , offbeat stories by Hughes Rudd , interviews by Ponchitta Pierce , a comely former bureau chief for Ebony magazine . Benti , 36 , and Brooklyn-born , sees his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create a new audience , or to take the old audience and make it aware of hard news in the morning . " <P> The " hard news " concept , the show 's basic theme , includes all the important events that have happened since the 11 p.m. newscasts of the previous night . " We wo n't use hashed-over news , " Benti insists . " It is either new , or our way of approaching it is new . " One of the new approaches is a continuing series on life in the ghetto , interpreted by Correspondent John Hart . By zeroing in on a two-block area along Washington 's Columbia Road , the Bend team hopes to involve its audience in the problems and progress-or retrogression-of a small group of ghetto people . <P> The program is clearly still on its shakedown cruise . Benti himself is engaging and incisive , but he has yet to emerge with distinctive authority and character . Hughes Rudd , who has a growing reputation as a writer of short stories and published a 1966 collection , My Escape from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news . Ponchitta , 26 , is obviously learning by doing and has awkward moments , as if suddenly numbed by awareness that the staring camera eye is on her . <P> In Benti , CBS has an undoubted if minor exclusive : he is the nation 's only Italian-Irish newscaster who is also a dropout from four Brooklyn high schools . After hitches in the Army and the Air Force , where he got his high school diploma , Benti in 1954 went to Indiana State Teachers ' College on the G.I. Bill , later earned his master 's at Iowa University . <P> While in college , Benti did part-time broadcasting , later worked at TV stations from Missouri to California . He settled down at Los Angeles KNXT , a CBS-owned-and-operated station , where he became political editor . He chaired the Western Regional Desk during the network 's election coverage in 1968 , and was heard by millions as anchor man on the news reports following the murder of Senator Robert Kennedy .               @ @ @ @ @ @
