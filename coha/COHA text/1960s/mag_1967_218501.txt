The Geneva accords of 1954 that separated North and South Viet Nam stipulated the creation of a buffer zone between the two countries . No troops were to enter this so-called Demilitarized Zone , which averages three miles in width on either side of the Ben Hai River frontier . Hanoi has long regarded the DMZ as a convenient , protected freeway for infiltrating its soldiers into the South . Flagrant though that violation was , in recent months Hanoi has done far more : it has turned the DMZ into a giant staging area and mortar and artillery base for its buildup against the U.S. Marines facing the zone . In almost a month of continuous fighting just south of the DMZ , the Marines have been repeatedly attacked in force and increasingly hit by round-the-clock , all-too-accurate mortar , rocket and recoil-less-rifle fire originating from the DMZ . <P> Last week , by land , sea and air , the Marines and South Vietnamese hit back in a multipronged , 10,000-man operation , sweeping into the DMZ area south of the border in an effort to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battalions struck from the south toward their own besieged base of Con Thien . A South Vietnamese task force roared northward up Route 1 all the way to the river border , then divided and turned back to push the enemy southward . Due north of Con Thien , a Marine battalion helicoptered into the DMZ to hammer the North Vietnamese toward the Marines moving north . And in a spectacular amphibious and helicopter assault , two more Marine battalions scythed in from the South China Sea . Waiting to do battle were two North Vietnamese regiments in the DMZ itself and at least three or four enemy battalions operating south of the zone - some 6,000 Communist soldiers of the estimated 35,000 in the border area . <P> A Formidable Fleet . Operation Hickory began with the Marine drive from Cam Lo to relieve Con Thien , which has been under almost constant mortar attack since May 8 . The terrain favored the dug-in enemy : a dense jungle tangle of banana trees , bamboo , betel-nut and breadfruit trees in which visibility was seldom more than 15 ft. , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within a mile of Con Thien when it was pinned down by fire from the seemingly deserted village of Trung An . The North Vietnamese had built of logs , trees and dirt an astonishing network of 300 holes throughout Trung An , were so well burrowed that even the U.S. bombers ' 1,000-pounders and napalm failed to root them out . The leathernecks called up big M48 tanks to break through the hedgerows and roll right up atop the enemy bunkers.
