For more than four centuries , Rome 's Pontifical Gregorian University has been both the pride and the protector of Roman Catholic orthodoxy . Eight of its alumni have become saints . Thirty-three have been beatified . Fifteen have become Pope , from Gregory XV ( 1621-23 ) to Paul VI . Every year 30 to 40 of its alumni become bishops . Fully two-thirds of the church 's seminary professors of theology have taken some part of their education at the Gregorian . <P> That success has not been without its costs . When Ignatius Loyola founded the " Greg " * in 1551 , he conceived of it as an intellectual citadel from which to battle the Reformation , and until 1966 it remained a bastion of authoritarian conservatism . Classes consisted of dry lectures in Latin , with no chance for student participation . Seminarians had virtually no lives of their own . They could leave their residence only in groups , and could never enter a store or restaurant . They could not take secular newspapers . They could not even wear trousers ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ residential colleges , representing 78 countries , wore colored cassocks , each color denoting a different nationality , and round , flat hats . <P> Beer , Blondes and Buuel . The Second Vatican Council changed all that . Although seminarians at the Greg had been advised by their colleges not even to discuss the council while it was in progress , the meeting had its effect soon enough . First , Pope Paul VI eased out conservative Giuseppe Cardinal Pizzar-do , secretary of the Sacred Congregation on Education and ex-officio chancellor of the Gregorian . He was replaced by a liberal French prelate , Gabriel Cardinal Garrone . Then , in 1966 , the Pope named Canadian-born Sociologist Herve Carrier , now 48 , as rector . <P> This fall , as the Greg heads into its fourth year of Carrier 's rectorship , the changes are little short of astonishing : <P> COEDS : Girls have invaded what was once an exclusively male world ; this year there are 198 females , mostly laywomen , among the Greg 's 2,858 students . The majority are in the Institute of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but a pert German blonde , Hannalore Oesterle , 25 , is studying in the department of theology , planning to get a doctorate and return to Germany to become religious editor of a newspaper . <P> DISCIPLINE : With the arrival of feminine skirts on campus , the male seminarians ' soutanes quickly vanished . In their place are typically collegiate " civvies " : khaki pants , sweaters , windbreakers and sports jackets . Students may visit Rome 's shops and restaurants . In the Greg 's main building , a new snack bar serves beer as well as coffee between classes . <P> CINEMA COURSES : Only a few years ago , Gregorian students were forbidden to enter Rome movie houses ; on-campus movies were limited to mild fare like My Fair Lady . Now students not only may go to movies in town , but get pretty heady fare on campus . Last year Father Nazareno Taddei , a cinema expert , introduced a course on <P> " Faith and Unbelief in the Contemporary Cinema " - and illustrated it with uncut showings of avant-garde films by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bergman . Vatican conservatives howled " Pornography ! " when Taddei ran Bergman 's erotic The Silence , but the show went on .
