Not since the Trotskyite riots in the 1920s had Moscow seen anything like it . While crowds of Russians watched with amazement , more than 400 African students last week battled Red cops in the streets , inside Red Square itself , right past Nikita Khrushchev 's own office window . " Moscow-A Second Alabama , " said one crudely lettered sign , in Russian and in English . " Stop Killing Africans , " warned another placard . <P> Mourning Bands . The race riot was touched off by the mysterious death of Edmond Asare-Addo , 29 , a second-year medical student from Ghana who was studying at Kalinin Institute , about 100 miles northwest of the capital . On the eve of his marriage to a Russian girl , the student 's body was discovered near the railroad tracks of a suburban Moscow station . The Soviet police claimed that Asare-Addo , drunk , had fallen down in the 11 - below- zero weather and frozen to death . But Ghanaians , who knew that the marriage was fiercely opposed by the girl 's Russian friends , insisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the snow . <P> Quickly swinging into action , students at Patrice Lumumba Friendship University spread the word to other Africans in Leningrad , Kalinin , and as far away as Odessa and Tashkent . The message : We march on the Kremlin . Wearing the traditional red mourning band of Ghana around their heads , the students gathered before the Ghana embassy on a street a mile from Red Square . " No trouble , " shouted their leaders as the procession trooped off , but at the end of the street , there was plenty . <P> Soviet police had barred the way with trucks and cars . When the cops refused to budge , the crowd began rocking a police car , intending to flip it over . Anxious to avoid bloodshed , and outnumbered 100 to 1 , the police gave way after a brief scuffle . As English-speaking Russian youths-members of the Young Communist League-blocked the view from Western photographers , the students regrouped , marched through the heart of Moscow singing freedom songs . But the police regrouped too , and near Red Square @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Loudspeakers blared " Entry to Red Square is closed , " but the Africans squeezed through a space between two trucks ; as two students dropped a policeman with a flying tackle , other marchers grappled with cops on top of the vehicles . <P> " It 's Natural . " Once again police gave way . The horde raced across Red Square , up an incline not far from Nikita 's window ( he was out inspecting an economics exhibition ) , past Lenin 's granite mausoleum , and on toward the historic Spassky Gate that leads to the inner Kremlin grounds . At that moment the huge iron gates clanged shut . Using sound trucks , the police pleaded with the students to disperse , but for two more hours they argued and jostled with police . Ogling the demonstration were thousands of Russians , who watched from the street and from the windows of GUM , the big state-owned department store , until employees curtained off the uncomradely scene .                   @ @
