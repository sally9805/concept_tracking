It was a year of revolutionaries-or would-be revolutionaries . Students and militants , black and white , neophyte radicals and New Leftists raised fists and hurled stones at the old order . The system must be destroyed ; the Establishment must be laid low . Obscenities mingled with tear gas in Chicago . Black Panthers roamed the streets of Oakland . With a sense of deja-vu-of old , familiar furniture being dusted off-barricades once again surrounded the University of Paris . There were no programs , or few of them , for the future ; there was only rage against the present . If the rage was often justified , the results of these revolutionary attempts ( sometimes mere games ) were doubtful . Here and there they did shake the established powers and did produce the beginning of reforms-although reform was not their stated aim . Predictably , they also provoked resistance and reaction , only entrenching the forces under attack . As the year ended , a different sort of revolution suddenly forced itself into the world 's imagination . It was represented by the flight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , in the devalued coinage of the language , the word revolutionary might still be properly applied . <P> <P> Incalculable Consequences <P> On the face of it , the space flight had little pertinence to the problems , the agonies of earth . It was possible to look at the moon over a Harlem or Watts rooftop and feel only bitterness at the money spent , the vast effort made , in a cause that would not alter a single life , a single dwelling in the ghetto . And yet the event was really incalculable in its consequences . Nothing comparable has happened in man 's history , except possibly the great ocean voyages that led to the discovery of the New World - and to the transformation of Western man . In Columbus 's day , as German Author Joachim Leithauser has pointed out , mankind believed itself to be in its old age , destined for poverty , sickness and evil . The famous Nurnberg Chronicle of 1493 predicted : " Conditions will be so terrible that no man will be able to lead a decent life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down upon mankind : Flood , Earthquake , Pestilence and Famine ; neither shall the crops grow nor the fruits ripen ; the wells will dry up and the waters will bear upon them blood and bitterness , so that the birds of the air , the beasts in the field , and the fishes in the sea will all perish . " <P> But the prophecy was false . What followed for mankind was not the Apocalypse , though there was to be abundant blood and bitterness . What followed was a tremendous resurgence of mind and spirit , a vast expansion of human knowledge and power , indeed a great age of reason .
