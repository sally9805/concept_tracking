THE BODY <P> Your face , my Thane , is as a book where men may read strange matters . - Macbeth <P> Even in absolute silence , animals are able to communicate with each other by an almost infinite variety of gestures and motions . In lower forms of life , such nonvocal expressions are often vital to the survival of the species . Man , of course , has the gift of speech . Yet he too is able to signal his moods and thoughts with a nonverbal vocabulary of gestures and expressions . These signals constitute a powerful silent language that is often as effective and direct as speech itself . The unspoken lexicon is becoming a subject of increasing interest to specialists in the new science of ethology ( the biology of behavior ) ; it is also providing new views into man 's hidden emotional world . <P> Minimal Place . Among the explorers of this uncharted corner of human interaction is a team of ethologists at work under Dr. Michael Chance in Birmingham , England . In a recent issue of the British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Dr. David Humphries , report that the team has isolated and catalogued no fewer than 135 distinct gestures and expressions of face , head and body . This human semaphore system , they explain , is not only capable of expressing an extraordinary range of emotions but also operates at a lower-and sometimes different-level of consciousness than ordinary speech . <P> <P> Examples of such nonverbal language are most easily observed in children under the age of six . Far less inhibited or restrained than adults , the nursery-school toddler operates largely by means of expression and gesture ; talk occupies only a minimal place in his limited culture . If , for example , a four-year-old thinks his favorite toy is about to be snatched away by another child , he probably will tense his lips and scowl , thrust out his chin and then raise his hand , as if to strike the offender with an open palm . In the ethological jargon of the Birmingham investigators , the child is in a " defensive beating posture . " The more forward he holds his hand , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Recognizing this change to an " offensive beating posture , " the other child may well decide to retreat , even though not a threatening word has been exchanged . <P> Subtle traces of this vivid posturing are still evident years later in adulthood . Like the angered child , grownups often turn an open palm toward those who happen to pose a verbal threat , although the gesture may be quite inconspicuous and unconscious . Women , for example , tend to make a rapid hand-to-neck movement when they are agitated , disguising it as a hair-grooming gesture . Men also exhibit similar signs of stress . Embarrassed by such a driving miscue as accidentally cutting off another motorist , they will frequently make a seemingly irrelevant sweep of their hair . Actually , the gesture represents a very real surge of inner tension or conflict . " If you find yourself doing this , " Brannigan and Humphries explain , " examine your motivation honestly-you will be feeling very defensive . "                 @ @ @ @
