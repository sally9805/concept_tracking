It used to be work , or simply play , for U.S. high school and college students in the summertime . Then came the big trend to summer study ( TIME , Aug. i , 1960 ) . This time the summer trend is to do something useful to help others . <P> The impetus is neither a desire to play Lady Bountiful nor a shortage of paying summer jobs , but a useful blend of altruism and self-interest . High school seniors yearn to report a substantial entry in that " Civic Work ? " blank on college applications ; collegians may want to put sociology lectures to practice . The Peace Corps is the model-but most of the jobs to be done are right at home . Says one delighted Boston mother , whose teen-age daughter is toiling in a hospital ward this summer : " She goes charging out of here in the morning like Florence Nightingale riding Paul Revere 's horse . " <P> 205-Pound Angel . The Boston girl is enrolled in a zesty enterprise called Operation Kindness , sponsored by United Community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agencies and institutions in greater Boston . The unpaid helpers are busy at everything from running bingo games to skinning rabbits for medical researchers at the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital . At a Massachusetts state mental hospital , a 15-year-old " beautician " cheerily restyles the hairdos of psychotic women and says : " I just love Nantasket Beach in the summer , really I do . But-well , I like this better . " <P> Operation Kindness has 2,000 youngsters at work in San Francisco , 3,800 in Philadelphia . In Manhattan , a towering varsity end from the University of Pittsburgh has worked 16 hours a day to keep tough kids from becoming drug addicts and alcoholics . A volunteer for the Young Life Campaign , Bob Long , 21 , can proudly look back on such experiences as the 14 nighs he spent helping one addict to kick the habit . " My man here stayed with me , " says Long 's grateful protege . " He 's my 205-pound guardian angel . ' ' <P> Taming Cobras . Much of all this began under seasoned adult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ launched by students themselves . In the forests of northern Minnesota , 16 collegians representing campuses from Bryn Mawr to Minnesota are living among the Chippewa Indians , who are 75% unemployed and too indifferent to care much . By organizing parties and ball games , the boys and girls of Project Awareness have slashed the Chippewas ' usual summer crime wave to a low that startles even the sheriff . <P> Judy Long , 22 , is a pretty June graduate of Northwestern University who enlisted 57 other students to tutor school dropouts ( rate : up to 75% ) in Chicago 's heavily Negro Lawndale area , stomping ground for gangs . One of the students , 19-year-old Elaine Stevens , works 20 hours a week as a summer research assistant in psychology at Northwestern , also coaches a Lawndale teen-age girls ' softball team called the Lady Racketeers . Along with batting practice , Elaine teaches baby care-her13-year-old third baseman is five months pregnant , and children of other teen-age players on the team form the rooting section . Pre-Med Student Gordon A. Fuqua , 21 , umpires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who might otherwise be rumbling in a Lawndale alley . Says Gordon : " What I 'm doing this summer is making me a better doctor than if I went to the finest medical school . "
