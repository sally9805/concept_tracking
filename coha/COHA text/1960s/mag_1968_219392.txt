As the G.O.P. readied itself for Jan. 20 , Democratic leaders still eyed one another warily and scanned the distant horizon . There was an appearance of cohesion : Hubert Humphrey had led the Democrats to a defeat but not to a debacle . Most encouraging was that in Senator Edward Kennedy the party saw a shining champion who had not been bloodied at all in the conflict-one , moreover , who offered the hope of future victory . <P> Last week , for the first time since Robert 's death , Ted Kennedy moved out of the seclusion of his Massachusetts and Washington bailiwicks . His journey took him to Morgantown , W. Va. , where he dedicated a federal rehabilitation center for errant youth named in Bobby 's honor . Recalling the 1960 primary campaign in West Virginia that confirmed Jack Kennedy 's position as front runner , and Bobby 's own campaign there last spring , Ted was momentarily husky-voiced . " These hills , these people , this state have had a very special meaning for my family , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We tried to make your problems and misfortunes ours and the nation 's . You made our misfortunes yours . " <P> Familial Duties . In Boston next day , Ted took up his self-imposed task of fund raising to pay off the $3,500,000 in debts run up by Robert Kennedy 's presidential campaign . He was determined not to let the $1,000-a-plate banquet at the Sheraton Plaza degenerate into a wake . After expressing the Kennedys ' gratitude to the " finest and dearest friends of our family , " he gently needled his mother Rose , introduced her as a " shy and retiring person , " as evidenced by her frequent appearances on NBC 's Today show . Listening to Ted , a Boston politician said sadly : " He could have been the nominee this year and if he had , he would have been elected . " <P> Whether he would have or not , the fact remained that Ted had clearly chosen not to run . The field of candidates would be open to others should he choose not to run again in 1972-he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his generation , and on him falls the weight of many and great familial burdens . Some of these responsibilities were apparent last week , when Ted flew down to Washington to escort Ethel Kennedy to the hospital and remained until a caesarean operation was completed and mother and daughter-her eleventh child-were doing well . The following morning Ted accompanied four of Ethel 's children to Arlington National Cemetery and knelt beside them at their father 's grave .
