THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment THESE last few months have been an education for all of us in the art of facing crises . Just by living through them , we have learned that disasters , catastrophes , and cataclysms , like everything else , can come to seem merely routine after repeated exposure . This does not make the individual crises any the less perilous , any the less absurd , or any the less tragic in their consequences . But it may be that in a nuclear-armed world  --  where we have as much to fear from our own overreaction to provocation as from the provocation itself  --  the more crises we face simultaneously , the better off we are . One might consider an analogy to be found in Konrad Lorenz 's book " On Aggression . " Observers of underwater life have long been puzzled , Lorenz says , by the behavior of certain schooling fish , like the herring , which have no natural means of defense , but which nevertheless flock together when they are in danger , .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - a - -   - -  - .cf , ap-a --  , M --  -- . , , , : 3 ,  - -   - -   - -   - -   - -   - -    - -  -  ....  - -   - -  instead of fleeing for cover in a hundred directions . Offhand , it seems that sticking together out in the open must he the worst thing the herring could do , since it provides an enemy , such as a hungry shark , with an easily visible target . But it turns out that the very size and defenselessness of the school of herring may constitute an embarrassment of riches for the would-be predator . A shark pursuing an isolated herring has no trouble zeroing in on his prey and making a dinner of it , whereas , according to Lorenz , " many , perhaps all , predators which pursue a single prey are incapable of concentrating on one target if , at the same time , many others are crossing their field of vision . " The author goes on to talk about a common tendency to " reach in the line of the resultant of two equally tempting attractive forces , " but what it boils down to is this : While the shark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pursuing one- , all the herring are darting about invitingly in the water , catching his eye , upsetting his timing , and , paradoxically , improving the chances of survival for all  --  including the predator , if we take our analogy one step further and assume that the shark is armed with nuclear weapons . A recent Gallup poll showed that only three per cent of the Americans interviewed wanted to go to war with North Korea over the seizure of our spy ship Pueblo and its eighty-three-man crew . Forty per cent were willing to use force " if necessary " to get the ship and men back , but in general the survey suggested that the man in the street was demonstrating a degree of maturity under stress that political columnists and politicians rarely give him credit for . Despite the egregious insult to American prestige ( in an election year ) , there was no great outcry for massive retaliation , no clamor to bring the boys back " at all costs , " nothing whatever that could be construed as a popular mandate to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majority of the Americans interviewed had carefully weighed the alternatives and concluded that the risk of setting off a nuclear holocaust was too great to warrant such action in this case ? Possibly . But it is also possible that the aggressive instincts of the majority were diverted by other , equally pressing concerns , such as the imminence of a showdown at Khe Sanh , and the Vietcong offensive against the cities of South Vietnam , and even by such relatively minor concerns as the unarmed United States Navy dive-bomber shot down by Red China off Hainan Island , and the still unrecovered H-bombs that fell over Greenland , and the threat of violence in our own back yard , and the crisis of confidence in our body politic . What would the reaction have been , we wonder , if the newspapers and the television networks , and the people in our government , too , had all been free to dwell on just the Pueblo crisis , instead of being diverted by a whole cluster of crises ? We may have entered a period in which it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deserves . Artificer IN these dark days , when with a happy ending is how exceptionally welcome a story that has not one happy ending but two ! We have such a story , and it concerns an English artist named Michael Ayrton , who , nut content with successful careers in painting and sculpture , has taken up a career as an author as well . His first novel , entitled " The Maze Maker , " was published here a few months ago and has received a universally favorable press . It purports to he the autobiography of the legendary Daedalus , and Mr. Ayr-ton has triumphantly brought off the tricky task of seeming to speak in the authentic voice of a man who , if he lived at all , lived some three thousand years ago , under very peculiar circumstances indeed . According to tales handed down from antiquity , Daedalus was renowned for his skill in fabricating things , both large and small . Among the large works attributed to him was a subterranean labyrinth constructed for King Minos , at Knossos , in which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a golden honeycomb , complete with golden bees , which he made as a thank offering to the Mother Goddess . Daedalus is also famous , of course , for having mastered the art of flying . In his novel , Mr , Ayrton maintains that Daedalus flew and survived because he accommodated himself to the thermal currents and remained respectful ) wary of Apollo , and that his son Icarus flew and perished because he was a fool and trifled not only with the thermal currents but with the Sun God as well : " The god made no sound , but threw Icarus out of his embrace .... It has been said that I saw him fall into the sea , but I did not . It has also been said that I searched the sea for hint and found his body . I searched but I did not find it . I do not know what his body became since I did not find him . I can only remember what I saw it become . " Ayrton was recently in town for a few days , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him . He is a good-Looking , bearded , appropriately archaic-seeming man of forty-seven , or perhaps three thousand and forty-seven , who lives in a fourteenth-century house in Toppesfield , Essex , with his wife , who is also a writer , two cats , and , in a nearby lake , an assortment of unimportanate carp . ( In the offing are three stepdaughters and four step-grandchildren . ) He was horn in London , on what is now the site of the Great Portland Street tube station , which he says he often passes with a ghostly sense of having been there before , His father , Gerald Gould , was a well-known journalist , and his mother was Barbara Ayrton , who was a prominent suffragette and , subsequently , chairman of the Labour Party . As a feminist , she added her name to her husband 's , and their son was born Michael Ayrton-Gould ; he later lopped off the Gould , as professionally clumsy . The parents were friends of Yeats , and one of Ayrton 's earliest memories is of the poet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the edge of the bed beside the three-or-four-year-old Michael , and intoning , " I 'll lull the child to sleep with a few ver-r-rses . " For some reason , this kindly statement , and the poems that followed , used to terrify young Michael , who would pull the blankets over his head and cower , unlulled , until the great man departed . A school dropout at fourteen , Ayr-ton spent a year or so with relatives in Vienna , then a couple of years studying art in Paris . He returned to London when war broke out and was designing sets and costumes for John Gielgud 's production of " Macbeth " when , in 1941 , he was drafted . ( This was the lowest moment of the war , but Girlgud was so wrapped up in his artisticlabors that , on Ayrton 's telling him he had been drafted , he replied abstractedly , " Why ? " ) Ayrton served in the R.A.F. , was invalided out in 1943 , and went hack to painting . " I achieved quite a reputation immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was embarrassingly easy to do , since we had been culturally isolated from the world for several years and a certain chauvinism gave me a temporary advantage . Subsequently , I went out of fashion as a painter , though I continue to paint and enjoy a modest success at it . I took up sculpture in earnest in the nineteen-fifties  --  I am a friend , if not exactly a disciple , of Henry Moore and my things do pretty well throughout the world . I 've also done a number of essays and documentary films , and I finally sat down to write my novel , because for a dozen years I have been obsessed with Daedalus , and I thought that writing about him would exorcise my obsession . What I had n't counted on was that the book might cause other people to become obsessed with him . Now they correspond with me about him , and even if I were ready at last to let him go , I could n't . " Which brings us to our story with the double happy ending . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astonishing variety of things with his own hands , wrote in " The Maze Maker " a detailed account of how to construct a golden honeycomb and some golden bees . " I never dreamed I 'd be given a chance to follow my instructions , " he said . " A reader in New Zealand has offered to commission a golden honeycomb and bees . He will provide all the necessary gold , and , of course , a fee . What a splendid challenge it is And , here in New York , another reader , the financier Armand G. Erpf , has offered me a far bigger commission  --  a stupendous commission . It is to build a maze for him at his country place in Arkville , in the Catskills . Mr. Erpf is a man of fantastic imagination ; I can tell already that nothing daunts him . My maze will have stone walls six and a half feet high , so nobody can see from one passageway to the next , and the correct passage will lead into two secret inner chambers , one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other a figure of Daedalus . The maze will probably he oval , and will be about a hundred feet across . Mr. Erpf has a distinguished collection of outdoor sculpture scattered about the lawns and fields of his Arkville place , and he thinks the maze will make a fine addition I doubt if anyone has commissioned a maze on this scale since Minos . What a patron , and what a reversal of fortune for me  --  not , after all , to he rid of Daedalus but to become him ! " The Sixteenth ON a chilly afternoon last week , we walked from our office past the vacant lot that was so recently the Hotel Astor , crossed Eighth Avenue and nodded to the supplanted and soon to be demolished Madison Square Garden , and proceeded west to say goodbye to a building that has played an important role in our area for a longer period than either the hotel or the old Garden . This is , or was , our neighborhood station house , the Sixteenth Pi ecinct , which is inconspicuously situated at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses  --  a row flanked at the east end by Congregation Ezrath Israel and at the west end by the establishment of Chic Gaylord , holster manufacturor  --  and which , after a hundred and eight years of almost unbroken service , is being shut down as part of a citywide consolidation that will reduce the number of precincts in the city from seventy-nine to fifty-five . Although special units will continue to operate out of the building for some months , the Sixteenth 's uniformed complement  --  two hundred and twenty-four officers  --  and its area , covering the seventy-seven square blocks bounded by Forty-second Street , Fifty-second Street , Fifth Avenue , and the Hudson River , are being divided between the Fourteenth Precinct , to the south , and the Eighteenth , to the north . When we looked the matter up , we learned , somewhat to our surprise , that the West Forty-seventh Street station house is not the oldest police-precinct building in New York City  --  the Bedford Avenue static in , in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn , predates it by five years  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under condemnation than any other building we know . As far back as 1905 , police surgeons were denouncing the structure  --  four stories of brick THE NEW YORKER and stone  --  as " a menace to health , " and William McAdoo , who was the Police Commissioner then , called it " damp , gloomy , forbidding , and incapable of being cleaned . " All this was  --  and still is  --  true . Nevertheless , the Sixteenth , during more than a century of keeping the peace between the Runyonesque denizens of Broadway and the formidable offspring of Hell 's Kitchen , has also ranked as one of the Police Department 's most highly coveted assignments . " Did you know the city 's most famous cop , Broadway Johnny Broderick , worked out of here ? " Sergeant Leroy McNally said as he prepared to escort us on a farewell tour of the building . The Sergeant , a dapper man , has spent thirteen of more than twenty years of service at the Sixteenth , and so has the distinction of having put in more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sure , the building could he cleaner , " he said reflectively as he led us up a metal spiral staircase to see the top two floors , devoted to lecture and locker rooms , and now littered with discarded equipment . " We could have used showers here , too . " He paused to pick up a battered cap and sail it into a pile of discarded clothing . " But the physical limitations of the place never affected the work of the men . Morale has always been good , primarily because this has always been a very active shop . It was the kind of precinct that not every man could work in , but the cop that could work here  --  he 'd get gaited for the city , he 'd get to love it . After a few years of protecting people around Radio City and Times Square and the theatres and the Garden  --  why , he 'd feel lost if he got put out in Queens somewhere . " On the second floor , as we passed the office of the Sixteenth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many a man who made detective on the strength of a good collar in the Sixteenth , " and then was almost howled over by an emerging patrolman . " The old Sixteenth is going out in style , Sarge , " the patrolman said after he had apologized . " Fabisenski and Smith collared a stickup man on Fiftieth Street , we had a guy knocked down by a car on the corner of Eighth Avenue , and I never saw so many 1039s . " What , we asked , were 1039s ? " Past burglaries , discovered well after their occurrence  --  generally when people return to their shops or businesses in the morning , " Sergeant McNally explained . In recent years , the rising number of 1039s , together with the heavy influx into the theatre districtin the evening , has led the commanders of the Sixteenth to concentrate much of their manpower on the four-totwelve platoon . " You 'd get a million people in this area on a good holiday-weekend night , " the Sergeant said . " They 'd all have to he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sergeant led us out a hack door and pointed across an alley to another building , consisting of two tiers of boarded-up cells . " They closed these a long time ago , and we never did have our own cells again , " he said . " We sure could n't use these ; they were built in 1860 , and they just could n't physically accommodate a man in the middle of the twentieth century . You 'd have to stoop to enter them , and even once he got inside , a man six feet tall would he unable to stand up . They were pretty awful . " Leaving the Sergeant shuddering slightly outside the cell block , we made our way to the muster room , where we found the desk officer , Lieutenant James Kiernan , working on the final entries on the Sixteenth 's blotter . " One of the good things about working here was that it kept you busy , " he told us . " We 'd get maybe twenty arrests on a good Friday night . " He pointed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ February is n't over yet , and we 're past the two thousand mark , " he said , with a sigh . " Oh , well , the cavalry went out of the Army , and the Sixteenth is going to go out of the New York City Police Department . " On the way back to the office , we encountered a Sixteenth Precinct officer we have known for some years . We asked his reaction to the closing of the station house . " What do you want me to say ? " he asked . " That I feel like crying about it ? " We said no  --  we just wondered how he did feel about the demise of the Sixteenth . " It was far from being one of the up-to-date houses , with all the conveniences , but I got used to it , " he said " Now that I think about it , I do feel like crying . " Labials and Fricatives THE film loop came around again on the projector , and General Kutuzov stood up to address his officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he had recited the same speech ten times in a row but because the French Army was threatening Moscow and the decision to attack or retreat was his alone . He glanced around the table at his officers and opened his mouth , and out came the fateful words " Gentlemen , I have heard your views . Some of you wo n't agree with what I say . But I ? ? the power vested in me by Russia and the Emperor  --  command a retreat . " There was a moment of silence . Then the dubbing director , Lee Kresel , said , " All right , let 's try it again . I need a breath on that second pause . " The film loop came around again , and an actor who was trying to match the English sentence to the image on the screen waited for his cue . At the precise moment that the General opened his lips , the actor leaned toward his microphone , and his husky voice rang out for the twelfth time " Gentlemen , I have heard your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a sound studio at 1600 Broadway , watching the dubbing in English of the approximately seven-hour Russian film adaptation of " War and Peace . " Mr. Kresel , who is fifty years old and wears a neatly trimmed Vandyke , and who works for a dubbing company called Titan Productions , had briefed us earlier on some of the fine points of dubbing . " We work like mountain goats , jumping from crag to crag , " he said . " The crags are the labials and fricatives . The vowelized words do n't matter  --  all vowels look MARCH 9 , 1 9 ( $ 8 more or less alike . But you ca n't mistake a labial or a fricative on the screen , so you must have one in English wherever there 's one on the original sound track and the actor is facing the camera . " This , he explained , means working from a special dubbing script , which not onl ) is faithful to the Sense of the original but also maintains the same distribution of labials ( " b " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and fricatives ( " Fs , " v " s , and " w " s ) throughout . As might be expected , content usually follows form in dubbing ( as long as no great violence is done to the plot or characterization ) . For example , when a French actress stares at her lover in a wet-lipped closeup and whispers " Je eetimc , " the English sound track can hardly have her whispering an unsynchronized " I love you . " But she may  --  as in an earlier Kreseldubbed picture  --  be heard murmuring a passionate " You 're him ! " Kresel , who writes his own dubbing scripts , begins by studying a literal translation of the original sound track , supplied by the overseas producer . Then he sits down at a Moviola viewing machine , either in his apartment in Manhattan or in his house in Southampton , and runs the entire film through once , to get the general drift , before proceeding to a painstaking search for a " peg " to hang each English sentence on . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labials and fricatives ) may remind him of an English phrase with the same rhythm . Or he may seize on a foreign word that closely resembles an English word in sound . Meaning is not the prime concern at this point ; the message of the sentence can always be reinforced by the vowel words that remain . Usually , it takes Kresel four or five weeks to complete a dubbing script . ( He has worked from originals in French , Italian , Spanish , German , Danish , Polish , Czech , Japanese , and Bengali as well as Russian . ) " War and Peace , " which presented special THE NEW YORKER 33 problems in addition to sheer length , took him nearly four months . According to Kresel , the Russians made the movie " as though they were going to be shipped to Siberia if they were n't faithful to the book , " and the " literal translation " they sent over was taken almost word for word from the familiar Oxford University Press version , by Louise and Aylmer Maude . Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it imposed the even heavier burden of maintaining the flow of Tolstoyan rhetoric while shifting all those consonants around . " Fortunately , it is n't the kind of book where people remember particular phrases with great affection , " Kresel said . " We do stick very , very close to the sense . " ( In the Maude translation , General Kutuzov addresses his officers in these words : " Gentlemen , I have heard your views . Some of you will nut agree with me . But I , by the authority entrusted to me by my Sovereign and country , order a retreat . " ) When Kresel finishes a dubbing script , and it has been approved by the United States distributor , he orders a print of the film cut into loops of from sixty to ninety seconds ' duration and begins auditioning actors from his stable , which consist of about seventy-five regulars . The ideal dubber is an actor who has studied singing ( for voice control ) , has sharp reflexes , and does n't mind submerging his personality . " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried using Method actors , but they take one look at a loop and come up with their own interpretation of how the line should be read , and we ca n't have that , " Kresel told us . " We 're completely hamstrung by what 's up on the screen  --  the facial expressions , the eyes , a nod of the head , a raised finger . Our job is n't to he creative  --  just believable . During an audition , I keep asking myself , Could that voice come out of that face " Kresel himself has taken an occasional turn behind the microphone ; he particularly remembers being called in to provide the sound track for a Broderick Crawford performance in " a terrible historical picture " shot abroad . His big line was " Feed her to the snakes ! " For this chore he won the highest accolade a dubbing actor can expect when Paul V. Beckley wrote in the Herald Tribune that " although the picture is obviously dubbed , Broderick Crawford ... seems to be reading his own lines . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hollywood pictures are often dubbed after the initial shooting to improve performances or correct mistakes , Kresel told us . " I once worked on an American Western in which an actor was brought hack just to say , ' There are six men left , sir . ' The line had originally- been ' There are seventeen men left , sir , ' but when the director got a good look at the battle scene , there were only six men moving . " Pictures made in Italy are idways dobhcd  --  even those shot in Italian . " For one thing , the way Italian movie studios are built , every time a plane went over , the take would be ruined , " Kresel explained . " And , besides , you ca n't keep Italians quiet on a set . " Dubbing procedures in Italy tend to be somewhat lax , according to Kresel . " They 'll just add a line , or change it completely , on the sound track . " In the films that Kresel has worked on , he has sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech just right . In the sound studio , the director and his actor moved on to another film loop . In this scene , General Kutuzov was addressing an emissary of Napoleon while the camera switched hack and forth between them . The first time the loop came around , the actor just listened intently to the way Boris Zahava , the Russian actor playing Kutuzov , delivered the original line . The next time around , the sound track was cut off and he read his own line aloud experimentally , trying to memorize it . t He had not seen the script prior to the recording session . ) The third time around , he was staring directly ' at the screen , trying to fit the English words to the Russian lip movements . After the fourth reading , Kresel suggested that they try a take . A tape recorder in the control room began to whir , the actor took a deep breath , and out came the words " Your Emperor 's message brought an offer of peace for us . Yet I 'm sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generations should I become the instigator of any such bargaining . "
