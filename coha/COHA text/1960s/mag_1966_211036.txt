While other Americans were off on vacation this summer , or at least enjoying tennis or a dip in the pool , Robert Welch , the founder of the John Birch Society , went about the U.S. on what must have been a dreary mission . As Welch tells it in the society 's bulletin , he spent a good part of the summer going " from one city to another , where acrimonious disputes were raging among our members . " Even worse , admitted Welch , " about all I usually accomplished , in trying to pour oil upon these troubled waters , was to get myself completely splattered with oil . " <P> Part of the trouble is Robert Welch himself . Though he agreed under pressure a few years ago to put some young men in important administrative posts , he still runs the society with an iron hand , brooking no opposition to his ideas and acknowledging no power to veto his decisions . Moreover , the society , founded on the notion that a Communist conspiracy was taking over the U.S. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time when the U.S. is fighting an open war against Communists in Viet Nam . <P> <P> No Fight . Dissension within the society came to a head with the resignation of two important members of the group 's national council : Classics Professor Revilo P. Oliver of the University of Illinois , a Birch theoretician with views far out even by the society 's standards , * and Slobodan Draskovich , a Yugoslav migr who heads a Chicago-based group called the Serbian Cultural Club . Oliver and Draskovich accused Welch of leading the society away from its basic aim of militantly combatting Communism into a purely educational role . " The fight has gone out of Mr. Welch and the John Birch Society , " says Draskovich . " The society is becoming increasingly frustrating to its members and decreasingly disturbing for the enemy . " <P> Despite the unrest , however , the society is far from disintegrating . It has a staff of 250-more than that of the Republican and Democratic national committees combined-at its Belmont , Mass. , headquarters and at regional offices in New York , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 75 full-time field coordinators and 1,100 section leaders direct the society 's chapters throughout the U.S. And though John Rousselot , the former California Congressman who serves as the Birchers ' public relations director , admits that the growth in membership has slowed down , the society is still attracting new members . It officially claims a membership of just under 100,000 , but some informed estimates place the figure as low as 32,000 ; the true figure is probably somewhere in between . <P> The society is more affluent than ever , profiting not only from the large contributions of anonymous wealthy donors but from a spate of its own activities . Its budget in 1964 was about $3,200,000 ; this year it will probably be in the neighborhood of $6,000,000 . Last year the society 's 360 " reading rooms " sold about $4,000,000 worth of materials . In addition to books and pamphlets , the society publishes a monthly magazine called American Opinion , a monthly newsletter and a weekly Review of the News . It runs a speaker 's bureau that has a roster of 250 people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is used by 175 radio stations .
