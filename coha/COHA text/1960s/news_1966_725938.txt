txt BOARD PRESSING TRANSIT SUBSIDY Estimate Majority Appoints ! O'Dwyer to Take Dispute to Appellate Division By CHARLES 6 . BENNETT A majority of the Board of Estimate disregarded Mayor Lindsay 's wishes and hired a lawyer yesterday to fight a ruling that the city could not subsidize the Transit Authority . The Democratic-controlled board and City Council have been trying to force a transit subsidy through since earlier this year . Their original object was to roll back the subway and bus fare from 20 cents to 15 cents . Now , however , they are trying to keep the 20-cent fare from going to 25 cents . The board members , caucusing in the Municipal Building office of Controller Mario A. Procaccino , selected former City Councilman Paul O'Dwyer to take their case to the Appellate Division . Also attending was J. Lee Rankin , who swore in Mr. O'Dwyer on the spot to handle the case . Move a Surprise . Mr. Rankin 's assistance to the board in employing Mr. O'Dwyer took the Republican Mayor by surprise . Earlier this year , after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in budget funds to subsidize the Transit Authority , Mr. Rankin ruled that the money could not legally be transferred . Similarly , the authority took the position that it could not legally accept the money without permission from the Legislature . Acting on Mr. Rankin 's opinion , Mayor Lindsay at that time opposed any action by the Board of Estimate designed to try to force the transfer . The subsidy move was ardently favored by the Democratic majority . The board voted several weeks ago , over the negative vote of Mayor Lindsay , to ask the Appellate Division ? under terms of the Transit Authority 's lease with the city ? to permit the transfer of funds even though the Legislature had refused permission . Mayor at News Conference Yesterday morning , while the Board of Estimate 's Democrats were caucusing with Mr. Procaccino , Mayor Lindsay happened to be holding a news conference at City Hall . In answer to questions , he repeated his position against the transfer of the $84.3-million and based his opposition solidly on the opinion that Mr. Rankin had given holding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should spend its energies in backing up my efforts to save the 20-cent fare and preventing it from going to 25 cents , " Mayor Lindsay said . He did not know that Corporation Counsel Rankin was meeting with the board 's Democrats . After he returned to his office he was told of Mr. IRankin 's participation and called ' him on the telephone . After the phone conversation // the Mayor said : " Mr. Rankin feels this is the best way to handle what the Board of Estimate members want to do . He has advised me to go along with the action , so I am following his advice . " At the same time , however , the Mayor said he had not retreated " one inch " from his position . The City Council , which is Democratic by 30 to 7 , is also pushing to force the subsidy . This summer it approved , over the Mayor 's veto , a formal transfer of $84.3-million to the Transit Authority . In an interview after the Municipal Building caucus , Mr. O'Dwyer said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is called a submitted question rather than an adversary question . That , lhe said , is because the Board of Estimate will be seeking court interpretation of a lease of city transit facilities to the Transit Authority . He noted that the transit agency has held that it was not legally in a position to accept money . A section of the Transit Authority 's lease with the city provides for submitting questions of law to the Appellate Division of the State Supreme Court . Mr. Rankin said , also in an interview , that he believed the authority was right . " If I feel Mr. O'Dwyer has not brought out all the facts , " Mr. Rankin asserted , " I reserve the right to come forward and supplement them . " Mr. O'Dwyer said he hoped for a prompt court ruling " so that the city can ask the Legislature to change the law if the court holds that the present law does forbid the $84.3-million subsidy . " Controller Procaccino was asked what would happen if the city was not permitted to subsidize the Transit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he replied , " that unless something is done come July 1 at the latest , the fare is going to go up to 25 cents . " Present at the meeting in the Municipal Building , in addition to Controller Procaccino , were Bronx Borough President Herman Badillo ; John F. Hayes , Deputy Brooklyn Borough President representing Borough President Abe Stark , and Leonard Cohen , Deputy Borough President of Manhattan , representing Borough President Percy E. Sutton .
