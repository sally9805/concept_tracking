JOHN JAMES AUDUBON by Alice Ford . 488 pages . University of Oklahoma . $7.95 . <P> The Frenchman who became the world 's most celebrated delineator of birds was himself a bird of paradox . His name , until he anglicized it , was Jean Jacques Audubon . His adopted home was the U.S. And his natural habitat , proclaimed in assuming an additional name , was " Laforest . " But a major part of his time was spent in courtrooms eluding creditors , in Europe 's royal courts soliciting patronage , and in scientific academies quarreling with competitors . <P> Alternately driven and dreaming , irresponsible and ingratiating , mean-spirited and maudlin , Audubon was inevitably misunderstood by contemporaries and , maintains Biographer Alice Ford , " errantly idealized " by her dozen-odd predecessors . As an antidote , Author Ford has presented , in rather stilted fashion , back-to-back facts that usefully clear away the web of fabrication that the Audubon family did their best to spin . <P> In-Port Wife . His granddaughters , romanticizing Audubon 's own embellished accounts , implied that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - the son of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette , whom she tried to smuggle out of France just before she died on the guillotine . John Audubon was , in fact , the bastard son of a Breton-born chambermaid , and was sired not at Versailles but in Haiti in 1785 . The father was Jean Audubon , a captain of French merchantmen and men-of-war . Though he commanded a corvette in Count de Grasse 's fleet at the surrender of Yorktown in 1781 , Jean Audubon was never , for all his son 's boasting , of flag rank or a staff officer in the so-called " Battle of Valley Forge . " He was also , despite land speculations in the Caribbean and Pennsylvania , ever at sea financially . When a native insurrection threatened his Haitian holdings in 1790 , he brought young John and another lovechild ( by a quadroon ) back to his complaisant in-port wife in Nantes . She happily adopted both of them . <P> John flunked out of maritime training school , and was bundled off to Pennsylvania to try his hand at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His first investment was in a frontier store in Louisville . On a typical day in the firm 's short , unhappy life , Audubon 's horse strayed away with a saddlebag full of cash while the proprietor stalked an unfamiliar warbler into the canebrake . Subsequent business ventures in other states and territories also foundered , leaving Audubon briefly in debtor 's prison . <P> Peddler in Coonskins . The failures convinced Audubon , at 35 , that his real vocation was as a painter and naturalist . He started on the 435 drawings that were to become his masterwork , The Birds of America . It was 18 years in the works , and in the meantime he supported himself as a sign painter , debutante 's tutor and dancing master . To help feed the two children , his wife Lucy taught school .
