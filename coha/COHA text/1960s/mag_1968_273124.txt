In what they called a " peaceful protest " last spring , Columbia 's rebellious students seized control of several university buildings , held a dean hostage and rifled private files . But university punishment , they insisted , would be downright illegal . Rather than answer a summons to a disciplinary proceeding , five of them went to federal court . <P> There they asked for an injunction barring any university action against them . Instead , last week they got a dressing down from Judge Marvin Frankel . Like an exasperated teacher correcting careless students back on the campus , the former Columbia law professor dismissed the legal arguments as " a whole series of errors . . . equivocal legalisms . . . sprawling verbosities . . . gross flaws . . . baroque rhetoric . " <P> As the judge saw it , the students ran into fatal trouble on the very " threshold " issue : he was not convinced that his court had jurisdiction , despite the students ' claim that the university was an agent of the state . Frankel agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that " is not enough to make the recipient an instrumentality of government , " he said . " Nothing supports the thesis that university ' education ' as such is a ' state action . ' " <P> Non-Sense . Although he left the way open for the students to seek further evidence to support their case and to plead again for an injunction , Frankel offered them little hope of success . One by one , he demolished their arguments . The Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination would not be violated by disciplinary hearings , he said . There was no requirement to say anything at the hearings . Nor should the hearings be delayed until after any criminal proceedings . " A motor-vehicles commissioner , authorized to suspend a driver 's license for speeding , need not wait for the months or years of a negligent homicide prosecution . " <P> The most fundamental-and fuzzy-student point was that the " rule of law " should be abandoned because the sit-ins were merely an exercise of the First Amendment rights of free speech and assembly . Said Frankel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at worst deeply pernicious ) nonsense in courts of law . It is surely non-sense of the most literal kind to argue that a court of law should subordinate the ' rule of law ' in favor of more ' fundamental principles ' of revolutionary action designed forcibly to oust governments , courts and all . This self-contradictory sort of theory-all decked out in the forms of law with thick papers , strings of precedent , and the rest-is ultimately at the heart of the plaintiffs ' case . " It was not surprising that Frankel found their case both " unsound " and " untenable . "
