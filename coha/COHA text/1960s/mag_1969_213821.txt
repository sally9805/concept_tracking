THE presidential soft sell , the lowered voice and the low silhouette had produced the impression of a vacuum in Washington . Now Richard Nixon is reacting against this feeling of drift . Under the pressure of events , he has begun to exhort and to " jawbone . " The pace is still hardly breakneck or the mood galvanic compared with those of more activist Presidents , but Nixon is clearly determined to reassert a sense of leadership . <P> He is acting on many fronts . He spent a hard-working weekend in the quiet of Camp David . He summoned Secretary of State William Rogers . Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird , National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger and top CIA officials to grapple with a painfully familiar topic : Viet Nam . Back in Washington , Nixon invited reporters into his office and vowed that he intended to stand behind his Supreme Court nominee , Judge Clement Haynsworth , " until he is confirmed . " He accused some of the judge 's critics of " vicious character assassination . " Then Nixon held a two-hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Administration 's proposals for narcotics legislation . <P> Nixon had said last January that he did not believe in jawboning with labor or business leaders to get them to hold down prices and wages , but in recent weeks he has adopted a mild version of the technique . He pleaded for restraint through 2,200 personal letters to union and management chiefs . He sent a pointed message to Congress , prodding it to speed up action on his legislative proposals . This week he expects to go into New Jersey and Virginia to provide some purely partisan support for Republican gubernatorial candidates . He also plans a speech outlining new directions in Latin American policy . <P> The rising presidential silhouette is having its greatest impact on the Viet Nam debate . Nixon 's unusually early announcement two weeks ago that he will deliver a major speech about the war on Nov. 3 has touched off intense speculation . Indeed , some of his severest critics on Capitol Hill were easing up , apparently convinced that something big is stirring . Senator William Fulbright , chairman of the Foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to wind down the war in Viet Nam " and predicted that the speech will demonstrate " his determination to liquidate " it . Fulbright postponed new hearings on the war until after the speech . Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield said he had moved in the direction of a ceasefire , and urged public support of the President 's efforts . <P> Republican Senator Howard Baker of Tennessee said he thought that " we might have American troops out of combat within a year . " Vermont 's Senator George Aiken made a similar prediction . Those views were given added weight by House Republican Leader Gerald Ford 's estimate that half of all U.S. troops will be out of Viet Nam by mid-1970 . Senate Republican Leader Hugh Scott contended that the U.S. is approaching a de facto ceasefire . He urged that the U.S. go a step farther and declare that " on a certain date we will stop firing , and if we are not fired on , a cease-fire will occur . "             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
