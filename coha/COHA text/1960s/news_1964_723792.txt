txt The Johnson administration 's ending of aid , predominantly military , to five countries in retaliation for their trading with Cuba was taken by Washington quite reluctantly . Indeed , the administration tried to find a way around the legislation which went into effect last Friday requiring the administration to take just such action . Nevertheless , the aid cutoff to Britain . France , and Yugoslavia  --  and the refusal of new aid to Morocco and Spain  --  comes at a time when Washington is doing all it can to get its allies in Europe to join in an economic blockade of Cuba . Linking Clear As such , the aid cutoff will undoubtedly be generally linked with this boycott action . That law , which went into effect Friday , specifies that no funds shall go to those nations which fail to take " appropriate steps " to prevent their ships and planes from carrying goods to and from Cuba . The French cutoff amounted to perhaps $25,000 to $30,000 , while the British cutoff was even less . The Yugoslav amount was described as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sales arrangements for these three nations . Spain and Morocco involve much bigger amounts , Spain , site of a number of large United States bases , was listed as receiving S30 million in arms aid last year . Morocco was reported to have obtained about $20 million in economic assistance in 1963 plus unspecified amounts of military assistance . Over a variety of United States protests . these countries have all stepped up their trading with Cuba in the past six to 12 months . British Sales Continue A British firm is selling 1,480 buses to Cuba . another is looking into the sale of road-building equipment , and the British Government has said it does not see any reason to stop this sort of sale  --  regarded as nonstrategic by the British . France is selling trucks , and other items ; Spain has established regular commercial air service with Cuba , once a Spanish colony . Morocco has been purchasing large quantities of sugar from the Caribbean island .                   @ @
