Sex has not been much of a subject for official debate since women got the vote . Now , however , as an unpredictable result of the 1964 Voting Rights Act , la diffrence bids fair to stir another furor . At issue is a clause in the law that bars job discrimination because of race , color , religion , national origin - or sex . Among harried employers , the new law has become known as the " Bunny problem , " because of an extreme but oft-cited example of the problems it may pose . Suppose , runs the hypothetical question , a man applies for a job as a Playboy Club Bunny . <P> Would the law require that he be hired ? <P> The problem is far from frivolous . <P> The sex clause affects all U.S. employers of 100 or more workers , a limit that will drop to 25 in three years . A new federal agency , the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission , has been set up to enforce the antidiscrimination ban- and seems likely to become Washing ton 's most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last July , 306 complaints of sex bias have been lodged with the commission . Typical was the case of a woman employed as an assembler in a California electronics plant . Although she holds a degree in electronics , she wrote , and could make from $1 to $3 an hour more as a technician , her employer refused to pro mote her on the convenient ground that she might have to lift something weighing more than 25 Ibs. - which would violate a California law that prohibits women workers from doing just that . <P> To help employers decide where sex ends and discrimination begins , the commission , chaired by Franklin D. Roosevelt Jr. , recently drew a set of guidelines defining unlawful sex bias . From now on , ruled the commission , it shall be unlawful to : <P> &gt; Treat jobs as men 's or women 's work unless the employee 's sex is " a bona fide occupational qualification " ( it takes a woman to model women 's clothes ) . <P> &gt; Refuse to hire men or promote women " because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customers , " unless the need is obvious , as in theatrical roles . <P> &gt;Forbid the hiring of married women , unless the same rule applies also to married men . <P> &gt; Use separate seniority lists that discriminate against either men or women . <P> &gt; Publish separate " male " and " female " help-wanted ads without a disclaimer that U.S. law forbids sex discrimination . <P> While Roosevelt does not believe the commission 's guidelines " will cause a revolution in job patterns , " he promised that the commission would " work cautiously " to avoid creating absurd situations . They will doubtless arise anyway . What about the woman pilot who aspires to be an airlines captain ? Or the man who loves kids so much that he applies for a job as a nanny ? The male homosexual who would like to fit bras for a living ? Hardly more farfetched is the case of two prostitutes , Jeanette McDonald and Hattie May Smith , who have appealed convictions in Oakland , Calif. , on the grounds of sexual bias . They were discriminated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were with them when they were arrested were released without charge .
