 | NEWPORT NOTES : The Kennedys and Other Salts N E W P O R T is a small Rhode Island center of excesses . To start with , its trees are enormous , outsized . Its magnificent estates along the Cliff Walk , most of which went up in the late nineteenth century in a competitive building splurge by wealthy New York families , are so large that in many cases they can be converted instantly into religious and educational institutions . The Newport Preservation Society has turned some into museums ; others , in these days of certain limitations for most , have appealed to the style of the Texans : some are already installed in palatial residences , the word is out , and more are on their way . Newport has been the place of the grand gesture ? where James Gordon Bennett was so outraged when a friend of his was barred from the exclusive Reading Room for galloping his horse into the place , that he built his own club in Newport Casino , a huge dark-shingled edifice which now houses the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Newport is quite as resplendent and excessive as that synonymous with racing for the America 's Cup ? the great yachting trophy which since 1930 has been competed for sporadically in the waters offshore . It is a remarkable spectacle . Roosevelt watched the races in the ' thirties from the Astors ' diesel yacht Nourrnahal . Eisenhower saw them in 1958 , and last fall President Kennedy was on hand to watch the competition whenever possible . The Cup is yachting 's most important trophy . It was won in an English regatta in 1851 by the schooner America , and after nearly being melted clown for inscribed medals , it was pulled halfforgotten from a carpetbag and deeded to the New York Yacht Club as a cup open to challenge from foreign countries . Up until last fall . seventeen challengers had crossed the ocean . Not one of them was successful . The America 's Cup has not budged from the New York Yacht Club . The trophy itself ? it stands twenty-seven inches high ? is actually of little practical or monetary value . It 's missing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars on the silver market . And vet incalculable millions have been spent in its name without any hope whatsoever of return ? an oddity among contemporary sporting events ? except the pleasure and excitement of competition , the elixir of winning , and for the loser the despair of defeat plus a sizable kick in the pocketbook . Sir Thomas Lipton spent well over . S3 million on his five green-hulled challengers , all unsuccessful ? except as advertising media for his tea , sales of which went up sharply in those years that Lipton challenged . Last fall a new challenger was on hand in Newport for a best four-out-of-seven series ? the Australian Sir Frank Packer 's twelve-meter Gretel , sailed by Jock Sturrock . The American defender , selected after a summer of elimination races , was Weatherly , a blue-hulled twelve-meter , skippered by Emil Mosbacher and financed by a syndicate of Wall Streeters . The twelve-meters ? now roughly 45 feet on the waterline ? may have been something of a comedown for those who remember the great J-boats of the ' thirties , often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towered as high as a fourteen-story building , but that first clay the spectator fleet ? moving out past Breton 's Reef lightship on a course for the America 's Cup Buoy , nine miles out ? was vast  | and colorful , numbering over two thousand craft by some estimates . Just over a century ago the Times of London was moved to say of the fleet out to watch the yacht America race around the Isle of Wight for the cup which bears her name that it was " such as the Adriatic never beheld in all the pride of Venice . " The same could have been said of last fall 's great fleet , and for the early arrivals at the Cup Buoy , looking astern and seeing that oncoming armada stream out from shore , it seemed as if catastrophe had struck and the land itself was under evacuation . Such a variety of craft was offered , particularly ancient designs , that one was often reminded of a vintage automobile show ? as if each owner of a bizarre or antique craft had spent that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that opening day ? bugeyes from the Chesapeake , converted fishing smacks from Maine , early Herreshoff designs , a pair of brigs with topsails set , a 33-ton Boier cutter with massive leeboards ? an infinite variety including a six-foot overall Sailfish , not much more than a surfboard with a mast , which bobbed furiously out of sight of land in a heavy chop close aboard the America 's Cup Buoy . In the cockpits of most yachts a Lloyd 's Register was kept handy , along with the binoculars ? to check who was who and what was what . An indispensable piece of equipment to have aboard was a transistor radio . Since the Coast Guard often shepherded craft as much as a mile from the competing twelve-meters , the radio was necessary to keep tabs on the progress of the race . Two stations carried accounts , the local Newport station , which did an excellent and authoritative job , and the Providence station WPRO , which periodically interrupted its mid-morning diskjockey show to provide bulletins and on-the-spot reportage , including an occasional report from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so by engine reverberations that he was largely unintelligible . These reports would give way all too quickly to the disk jockey . He utilized , in the manner of his kind , an hysterical machinegun patter to introduce the hit records ? of which Sherry , Venus in Blue Jeans , The Monster Mash ( that graveyard smash ) were the favorites that week ? the strains of these teen-age tonics incongruously caught and eddied on the wind . The disk jockey 's remarks about the race itself indicated a rudimentary knowledge of yachting to say the least . On one occasion he speculated that the yachts raced around an oval course , like racing cars , a statement that so upset an elderly yachtsman who happened to hear it below-decks aboard Winthrop Aldrich 's Wayfarer that he picked up the offending transistor , fiddled with it truing to throttle the disk jockey 's voice . and . confused by its workings , hurled the instrument to a settee and slapped a cushion over it . The transistor murmured there , muffled , until it was resurrected for the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a Goodyear blimp . Broadcasters and newsmen used it during the day . At night it cruised above Newport , flashing down messages from a screen rigged aft of the gondola . One would hear the purr of its motors , far up , and look into the night sky to see the letters " WELCOME GRETEL , " in red , drifting through the Milky Way . Its vocabulary was not large . It liked the word " WELCOME . " " WELCOME JFK. " it proclaimed through the darkness the night the President arrived from Washington . T H E President and his family spent their vacation at Hammersmith Farm ? his father-in-law 's ( Hugh Auchincloss ' ) home , a large , rambling , dark-shingled house whose architecture is especially busy ? all angles , corners , turrets . A piazza looks out on a broad meadow sloping down to the narrow entrance of Newport harbor . and in the evening the sun sets directly opposite , beyond the bluffs of Conanicut Island . Just off the main channel an eccentric , many years back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ island with a two-story gabled structure so large that it is difficult to distinguish the rock that supports it ? so that at first glance the house seems to be floating serenely out to sea . It has been deserted for many years , and rats as big as terriers are supposed to scuttle through its timbers . But it is remarkably picturesque , and there was hardly a youngster passing by in the spectator fleets who did n't take a crack at prodding his parents into buying the place and taking up residence . The President knows Newport well . He has spent many vacations at Hammersmith Farm , both as Senator and President . His predecessor , Dwight Eisenhower , spent the last summers of his Administration at Newport ? first at the War College . then at Fort Adams . He went out to see one or two Cup Races in 1958 , but for summer activity Eisenhower much preferred playing  | the Newport Country Club golf course which is just across the road from Hammersmith Farm . On one occasion . Kennedy , then the junior Senator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and he came down the curving driveway from Hammersmith Farm and crossed the road to watch President Eisenhower 's progress from the tenth to the eleventh hole . The fairway is shielded from the road by a thick screen of shrubbery , mostly honeysuckle , and through this barrier Senator Kennedy , using his hands to part the branches , peered briefly at the Presidential golfing party going by . Now the entrance to the Farm is guarded by a sentry box , and the Secret Service guards have moved across the road . They stand silently in Mrs. Auchincloss ' gardens , by the rhododendron bushes , and at night their cigarette ends glow like fireflies . President Kennedy took a more active interest in the Cup Races than his predecessor . Whenyet possible , he went out to see the races aboard he destroyer Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. , Mrs. Kennedy with him . Caroline , and guests ? the President and many of the latter wearing brown leather flight jackets bearing the Presidential seal and his name stenciled on the back . Air squadrons around the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insignia affixed hove the breast pocket ; for most of the Cup Races the President wore one a helicopter squadron had given him a few days before . The i , kets were fine for the crisp weather that turned up in the latter part of the series , and he guests wore them with some pride , particularly the girls , though from the back , seeing three r four of these stenciled dark jackets in a row , ne took the wearers to be members of some organization , a roller-skating team , perhaps , ailed the " John F. Kennedy " out for a day on he sea .... The Farm 's pier stands far enough into the channel for the motor-yacht Honey Fitz to embark the Presidential party and transfer it to theJoseph P. Kennedy Jr . for the long trip out to ha America 's Cup Buoy . The Honey Fitz is a familiar sight in Newport waters ? the Barbara ' , Jr she was called during Eisenhower 's tenure , d was used to ferry him from the War College r his golfing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portrait of Kennedy 's grandfather ? ( peppery Boston politician ? hangs in the ht 's salon . A large leather chair has been inlied in the after cockpit ? like an ornate fishing air ? and when the President is n't sitting in it , the motion of the boat rocks and turns it spookily its casters . BY GEORGE PLIMPTON 41 At the America 's Cup Buoy , so many yachts were jammed into a small area of sea that they showed up on the Joseph P. Kennedy Jr . ' s radar screen as a solid mass ? the first time any of the men on the bridge had ever seen such a thing ? as if their destroyer had grounded on a submerged reef at high tide and was now , at low tide , sitting up on an extensive shelf of dry land . The big excursion steamers kept clear of this ruck ? standing off as much as a mile from the fleet . Each had over a thousand spectators aboard , and their weight ? crowded on one side to watch the twelve-meters ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portents of marine disaster . Hundreds of transistors played bravely out there ( " Sherry . . . **25;373;TOOLONG ? " ) , but then a belch of black smoke from her stack and a steamer would revive , apparently , and lopsidedly work in toward the fleet . INTEREST in the start was intense . The relative performance of large yachts in the same class can often be gauged in those first minutes of competition . When the schooner America first arrived in England in 1851 , the Royal Yacht Squadron had a representative waiting for her in the Solent , the crack cutter Laverock , whose function was to engage the schooner in a test of speed to see if she was as fast as reported . Commodore Stevens of America accepted the challenge , somewhat ruefully since he beat Laverock in their short informal run so decisively that British yachtsmen were scared off and he was unable to arrange lucrative races . Similarly , the relative qualities of Columbia and Sceptre , the twelve-meter competitors in the America 's Cup in 1958 , were made markedly clear in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the English boat , got the better start , but Columbia sailed through her lee with impunity and began to stretch out a lead . Commodore Vanderbilt , three times successful defender of the America 's Cup in the great J-boat class , was watching from his motor-sailer , and he turned to Lod Guinness , one of the British syndicate backers of Sceptre , and said firmly , " Well , I 'm sorry , Loel , but that 's that . " Guinness was dumbfounded . He had just arrived by plane from Europe the day before to watch a best-of-seven series , and after the first five minutes of the first race he was being told that as far as his boat 's chances were concerned he might as well start repacking . Commodore Vanderbilt was right . Sceptre was routed in four straight races ? and everyone was downcast .  | The fact is that Americans are embarrassed about the Cup . This country has held it for over a century . In particular , the embarrassment stems back to the latter part of the era of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Cup five times over a twenty-one-year period with his Shamrocks ? each with a potted shamrock below for luck ? and each time was defeated . Sympathy for him and his " green ladies , " as he called his J-boats , was widespread . Americans pitched in and gave him a loving cup after each defeat , and following his fifth and last defeat in 1930 ( which netted him a loving cup two-and-a-half feet tall ) when he cried out " I can not win ! I can not win ! " there was , as Ring Lardner wrote , " hardly a dry eye in any American speakeasy . " It has not always been so ? such sympathy for the challenger . In the early days of the Cup defense , American yachtsmen went to extreme lengths to insure that the challenger would return home empty-handed . James Ashbury 's first challenge in 1870 was thwarted when the New York Yacht Club sent a fleet of twenty-three yachts against his challenger Cambria . The Ashbury yacht came in eleventh ( even America , who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , coming in fourth ) , and yet the American public raised very little fuss about the injudicious odds . They wanted to keep the Cup . Besides , Ashbury was a dandy , a tall , pale fop with a habit of running delicate fingers through his beard . It got out that he bathed every night ? and that was an excess that did not endear him to the Saturday-night-bathing American public . Now , nearly a century later all this had changed . The Australians were not expected to fare well , but their people were very popular in Newport , their spirit and humor appreciated ? they were less standoffish than the British four years before ? and throughout the fleet waiting at the start , flags and banners offering support and good cheer to the Australians sprouted on boats from Marblehead , Rye , Annisquam , and other ports along the Eastern seaboard . At the starting gun , as Gretel and the defender , Weatherly , moved out to windward on the first leg of the America 's Cup Course , all eyes watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the downwind legs . If she could hold her own on the windward legs ? that is to say tacking for a mark upwind ? then her chances were good . After ten minutes she had fallen off a bit to be sure , but not seriously , and throughout the fleet there was genuine excitement . Yachtsmen were relieved that at least they were going to see a series of yacht races , not the sort of sailovers they had seen in 1958 . It was at the finish that this relief manifested itself most strongly . A fine salute of horns greeted Weatherly when she crossed the finish line . But when Gretel crossed the line , just under four minutes later , not an unsatisfactory showing , but still a loser , a fantastic din broke loose . Every horn in the spectator fleet seemed to have a thumb pressed on it , every whistle-lanyard seemed to be clutched ? so that such a welter of sound boomed about that acre or so of yachts wallowing by the finish line that the Australians. some of them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their senses , and they looked into each other 's faces for assurance they 'd lost the race . The din kept up for two or three full minutes . The destroyers ? five of them ? and the Coast Guard vessels were part of that salute , and even when it had died down , on the long haul back to Newport ? nine or so miles away ? occasionally a horn would erupt , imitated by others , then more , so that the entire flotilla flanking the in-going Gretel would join in yet another tribute of noise . When Gretel rounded Fort Adams into Newport harbor , an additional tumult of horns , bells , klaxons , whistles rose out of Breton 's Cove where much of the New York Yacht Club rode at anchor , and when Gretel moved slowly to her dock position a crowd of perhaps a thousand , jammed on the wharf , even on the dock-shed roof , began to applaud . The Australians clambering over their boat , getting her shipshape for the night , looked as one might expect under that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and extremely confused . T H E New York Yacht Club held itself a cocktail party across the grounds and in the mansion of the Berwind estate on Bellevue Avenue ? an ornate and massive edifice which fronts the avenue and in back looks out above a series of stairs and terraces to a vast expanse of lawn sloping gently to a distant row of trees bordering a formal Italian garden ornate with a few gazebos and a maze . " The Elms " this grand place is called , lately owned by the Berwind family , the last of whom was a sprightly lady , Julia , who well into her eighties could perform , and often did , a creditable high kick . She died just two years short of a hundred , and The Elms , after a worrisome tussle with contractors who would have turned the place into apartments , was snapped up by the town 's Preservation Society , to preserve in its original state as much as @#  | possible a Newport " cottage . " Large porcelained and glistening rest rooms were installed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art shows , and debutante parties , and for just such use as the New York Yacht Club put it to with their cocktail party . Yachtsmen in convocation produce an astonof noise ? more decibels per large offered up by alumni gatherings , or even New Year 's Eve stand face-to-face and their wives close in belt is n't that the average yachtsman is necessarily hearty or vigorous ? the outdoor prototype ? or that his vocal cords are highly toned by yelling at his wife to trim the jib sheet . Such torrents of sound are caused by pent-up relief let go ? in reaction , invariably subconscious , to getting one 's craft safely to port , moored and shipshape after the day 's tussle with the elements . The more boisterous the weather , and the more extended the yachtsman , the more piercing and declamatory his clubhouse chatter is in the evening . The mildest of bank subalterns is so affected by the tonic of the day 's racing that no matter what his subject of conversation ? the care of apple trees ? he stands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sloshing from his glass , his eyes sparkling behind his spectacles , his mouth ajar as he shouts into the ruddy , storming faces opposite him his considered views of insecticides and pruning forks . By and large , the wives are similarly affected . There is hardly a vestige of femininity among them at a cruise gathering of this sort ? their behavior hearty , their voices strident , and their clothes suitable for a ramble in the fens . A woman with any semblance of being fashionably ishing amount room than are American Legionnaires , celebrants . Yachtsmen shout , often in concert , side them to lend effort .  | outfitted would be the wife of a motor-yacht owner or a " stinkpot skipper , " as the sailing crowd would refer to him . Headroom below on motor-yachts is substantial enough to hang clothes their length and there is room for a mirror or two . The tackiest of the crowd are those off the small two- and three-ton sailing craft ? where below-decks is as confining as a badger 's warren . Whatever is worn is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it probably has been ? from a slightly clamp seabag . The wind had been brisk and steady that afternoon . Music was provided at The Elms party but it was impossible to hear above the tumult . The crowds swirled through the lofty rooms beneath huge canvases ? themselves swirling with richly painted battle scenes , the immaculately garbed generals staring out from their proudly rearing mounts with fine disdain and withdrawal , as if the background scenes of carnage and cannonading were beneath notice , and what they saw in The Elms beneath dignity . Their contemporary counterparts in rank ? the officers of the New York Yacht Club ? moved below , far less resplendent in their dark blazers , black buttons with the anchor , and their barely visible black braid stripes of office at their sleeves . Some commodores touched up their drab dress for America 's Cup Week : Winthrop Aldrich turned up with gold buttons on his blazer , a large and festooned crest emblazoned above one pocket , a handkerchief sprouting from the other . All officers , from the rank of commodore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit of braid , a crest ? and these at The Elms party were carried by their owners rather than checked at the cloakroom : when the officers moved outside , through the French doors onto the terraces overlooking the lawns , the caps were slapped on with alacrity , and properly squared ? as if perhaps head colds lurked in the warm fall afternoon . Large stone statues dominate these terraces . The Berwinds enjoyed strife in their art ? the battle scenes within and the statues on the grounds continue this motif : a large nude under harassment from a pair of satyrs , two stone lions , one carrying a dead bird , the other wrestling with an alligator . The sunset came , and for an instant it illuminated these friezes of combat and appetite ? tipping the stone bird 's plumage with a suggestion of its blood . Then the darkness fell to soften realism , and people set their drinks between the lions ' paws . Down at the end of the lawn , a subsidiary bar had been set up among the trees bordering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearing their yachting caps . Lamps glowed there . and mosquitoes , fat and crippled into languor bs the first cold snaps of the fall a few days before rose up on their last raids in heavy swarms . Yachtsmen kept themselves busy whacking at them , catching them out of the air , stunning them off friends ' collars and ears , so that viewed from afar , from the terraces , the crowd around the distant bar seemed engaged in violent argument ment ? arms flailing in jabs and hooks . Everybody smoked down there , feeling the fumes might hinder the insect attacks , so that the feinting and flailing was carried on in heavy blue clouds of smoke ? heightening the effect of combat . Wearying all this . and Thames Street in Newport too ? the harborside stretch of bars and restaurants , jammed all those nights of the Cup Race with celebrants from the New York Yacht Club . The Cameo was the Australians ' favorite hangout ? " The Royal Cameo , " the place was christened after the Australians ' victory in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The usual Navy Base clientele was crowded out ? as it was throughout America 's Cup Week ? and went elsewhere , subdued by the ardor of yachtsmen ashore . Finally , late at night , it is the sea itself ? the ( lark mirror-calm reaches of it in Breton 's Cove where the fleet of yachts lies at mooring ? which snuffs out the boisterousness . There is nothing to echo the yachtsman 's voice back at him ? so that he is conscious as he bellows his farewells at dockside that his voice is taken in by the darkness and diffused . Then , suddenly utterly sober , he rows his dinghy for the Springbok , or Argo , or Maltesa , or Sabrina , or Ulysses II . His wife , sitting in the stern , points the way past his shoulder , and he adjusts his course accordingly . He rows easily , watching his oars puff up clouds of phosphorescence . In the smaller yachts the soft yellow light of kerosene lamps shines dully through the ports and vaguely up the companionway onto the underside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all , they whisper , and as they pass they hear the tick of metal rigging high in the yachts moving imperceptibly but restlessly at their moorings . Once aboard his own craft , the owner checks the riding light , the set of the current , and the scope of his mooring before going below . The sea and its proper rituals have repossessed him . T H E Australians won the second race by 47 seconds ? the first time a challenger has won a race in the America 's Cup series since the Royal Yacht Squadron 's Endeavour I won the  | second race against Rainbow in 1934 . The Australian boat , sailing on a broad reach , forged ahead halfway down the second leg of the triangular course in a move so swift it did n't seem to belong to yachting . She got an enormous following wave under her transom , kept it there , and seemed to coast along , downhill , like a surfboarder . It was an extraordinary thing to see . She caught and went by Weatherly in seconds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to watch as grass growing ? and vet here , for one moment , at least , as Gretel 's stern rose up and she went by Weatherly on that monster wave , it seemed as if a film clip of the two yachts was speeding through a runaway projector ? and yacht racing suddenly took on the aspects of a hundred-yard dash or the twentyfour-hour car race at Le Mans . On board Gretel one of her crew felt the yacht lift , tremble , and surge under him , and he let loose with a long bray of excitement , picked up and echoed by the rest ? a wild cry that was swept across and heard by the inboard craft of the spectator fleet running parallel , certainly by Weatherly alongside ; her crew , struggling with a balky spinnaker , looked up , startled , and saw Gretel planing by . Aboard her , at the wheel , Jock Sturrock was concentrating on his steering , and the excited shouting of his fellow Australians scared him ; later he said that his first thought was of catastrophe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Despite the Australians ' win , the spectator fleet diminished rapidly . Sir Frank Packer called for postponements after every race , stretching the series late into a second week , and yachtsmen ? with regret , since the series was so evenly matched ? began to pull out of Newport for home waters . Others , true yachtsmen for whom no other possibility existed , changed their plans , stayed on , and spent the lay-days at the slips , where they watched the competitors tinker with their yachts . B A I L E Y ' S BEACH , the exclusive beach club more properly known as the Spouting Rock Association , is situated on the curve of a small bay on the ocean end of Newport . Two or three hurricanes have swept in and almost demolished the low-lying clubhouse and myriad rows of cabanas , but the place has endured and last year expanded its plant with the construction of a large , controversial , and fancy swimming pool . Up to that time the members had been content with the ocean ? though its temperature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PLIMPTON 45 monly choked with long strands of kelp , and often sports a rich purple color which results from some bacteriological phenomenon ? a true " wine-dark " sea . The swimming pool was installed only after an acrimonious debate between the traditionalists on one hand , who felt that such a thing would change the character of the club beyond repair , and a Young Turk contingent , which was done with emerging festooned with kelp from the cold , purple sea . The swimming pool , completed in July , two months before the America 's Cup Race , had been a great success . Even the grandes dames of Newport , who with their parasols have walked the gentle curve of the promenade past the cabanas for decade on decade , now do their promenading around the pool . President Kennedy would arrive at the beach with his children early ? at eleven , a couple of hours before the promenading ritual ? and the beach then , even on the most brilliant days , was usually deserted . Of course , the Secret Service men were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take on certain characteristics of their surroundings . When Eisenhower played at the Newport Country Club they fanned out ahead of his party disguised as caddies ? carrying canvas golf bags which one could see contained two or three rusty irons and a wood alongside the wooden stock of a carbine . At Bailey 's Beach , guarding Kennedy , they shifted into blazers and flannel trousers in order to blend in , but you could always distinguish them because they looked chilly ? their blazers buttoned from top to bottom ( to keep the armaments from view , presumably ) ? and somewhat forlorn . . . waiting for someone , it would seem , if one did n't know their function . . . waiting endlessly by the cabanas for some tennis date to show up . The President usually stayed at the beach for a couple of hours , using his father-in-law 's cabana , playing in the sand with his children . His son , John Jr. , is at that stage where it takes very little in life to satisfy him . To be tumbled in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balanced on his father 's knee is a thing of infinite pleasure . Walking , he kept his arms up to hold his balance , and he churned about rockily , usually wearing a large grin , with a tooth in it . Caroline : another matter . She is bewitching . Far more successfully than the Secret Service , she has the gift of epitomizing , even emphasizing her surroundings ? so that watching the Bolshoi at practice . for example , she is the essence of solemnity , and on the beach , her hair full of  | sand , she is its creature ? a gamine 's moppet face , bright with high coloring , her eyes , large and blue , connected across the bridge of her nose by freckles brought back from the Italian sun that summer . Close to , these eyes inspect one with a sense of appraisal rather than curiosity , or the blandness that would be typical of her age , so that there is the tight feeling under her quick clinical scrutiny that one had better come up with something , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced from some inner pocket . The President now found himself in this position ? having to produce something for her to do . Well , the President said ( and one felt he was casting about ) , would n't it be fine if she raced down to the ocean and brought him back some seawater so he could test its temperature . She set off instantly She runs like a sprinter ? back straight , head steady , only the underpinnings moving . and these churn at only one speed ? top . She flew clown toward the water , seventy or so yards away , calm that day , and purple as usual . She reached the water 's edge , stooped , and came hack across the sands , her hands cupped now ? the seawater within , leaking out as she ran at top speed for her father . She reached him , went to her knees , and held out her hands . The exertion of her flight had n't bothered her at all ; she was hardly winded . The President leaned forward , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A drop fell to the sand , the last of the seawater : the small open palms were damp , no more . " Well , where 's my seawater ? " the President asked . He grinned at her . His daughter looked at him . A torment was evident ? frustration , perhaps , annoyance at being hoodwinked into what was evidently a Sisyphean task . She strained to decide what attitude to take ? and then suddenly it came : the whole business was to he dismissed instantly . The past was to be put from mind , and only the future considered . She came up off her haunches , and said she wanted to show her father some " secret caves . " Where were these caves ? the President wanted to know . She pointed at a jumble of rocks at the end of the beach . She tugged at his hand . The President looked and felt the " caves " were pretty far for him . He said he 'd pay them a visit when she got them " cleaned up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Reasonable enough that seemed , and his daughter hopped up on the cement promenade and hastened past the row of cabanas toward the end of the beach . A friend joined her , and the two hurried along . On the walk , a few of the delicate parasols were out by then , swaying as their bearers turned to watch the two . The President sat at rest in the sand . He watched his daughter move down the promenade ; his section of beach was quiet . Then John Jr . appeared again ? thumping sturdily through the sand toward his father . His grin , the tooth shining in it , was enormous . He fell down and got up again . The grin seemed to remain fixed throughout the tumble . But as he neared his father the grin suddenly vanished , his face worked briefly and it was evident he wanted to say something . His father leaned forward a trifle anxiously . Was there a request ? A few words tumbled out past the single tooth , but they were unintelligible . Another attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For a time , at least , a smile was all he had to cope with . Articulation was not yet there . though it would come , of course . The President lay back in the sand , lifted his child up on his knee , balanced him there , and looked up at him solemnly . 0 N SUNDAY , September 16 ? a spectacularly beautiful clay with a bright sun which sprouted dozens of parasols at Bailey 's Beach ? a race took place offshore . bitterly contested , part of it witnessed by the President , between the 27-ton Brigantine yacht Black Pearl and the 33-ton Boier cutter Flevo . Ever since he 's owned Black Pearl , Barclay ( Buzzy ) Warburton , has been stung by criticisms of his yacht 's speed . ( " Well , the point is can the damn thing go ? " ) His yacht 's lines are bray e , she sports a square-rigged foremast , and Warburton is proud that in aspect at least it seems as if Black Pearl could well have served somewhere on the periphery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeatedly to rent her out as a pirate ship to motion-picture companies and ca n't understand why an enterprising writing team does n't do a television series utilitizing Black Pearl as heroine . It came as no surprise when Charles yl'acker III , a Chicago businessman and master of the cutter Flevo , made some uncomplimentary remarks at a cocktail party about Black Pearl ( " Well , the point is can the thing float ? " ) that Warburton , cut to the quick , offered to race against Flevo . He suggested as a stake a case of the " finest champagne , " provided such a stake was equally matched by the Flevo people . Wacker ? probably against his better judgment  | since Flevo is of massively bulky . design , sporting leeboards , and is described by some as a " gravy boat awash " ? accepted the challenge , sent out for his case of champagne , persuaded the Marquis of Milford Haven to be his sailing master , and conscripted a crew which included Senator Pell of Rhode Island . Mrs. Oates Lighter offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was used forthwith to dispense the stakes . A race committee was formed . It hastened to point out in a directive handed both Warburton and Wacker that " there shall be placed on board the committee boat before the start two bottles of fair , amber Scotch whisky to insure a fair , if obscure , decision . " The committee went on to say that it was open to a certain amount of bribery . Its directives were laden with regulations and restrictions , among them that neither craft could use for locomotion its engines , or powered bilge pumps ; nor were flippered feet allowed to dangle over the side . Any failure to comply with the extensive rules meant that the offender would be sunk ? the actual polite , if menacing , phrase used in the directives being " under penalty of loss of buoyancy . " The only interesting moments of the race were at the start . Warburton got Black Pearl on his opponent 's tail ? the favored position to hold ? upon which Milford Haven tried to lure the deeper-drafted Black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shake him , if not to shipwreck him in there . But Warburton would n't bite , and with fine calculation he came away from his opponent so that at the starting-gun he held the windward position at the line , moving his boat steadily and well , and on the starboard tack . " An absolutely classic start , " he said a number of times afterwards , particularly when in the hearing of either Milford Haven or Charles Wacker , or any of the other Flevo crowd . Flevo , despite her enormous mainsail , fell steadily behind at the start . She had some difficulty getting out of the trap she had laid for Black Pearl , and lost further ground when later , a few miles out , she had to tack frantically to avoid an incoming tanker which gave no indication of giving way . Both skippers have had trouble of this sort with ocean-going freighters and liners , and are beginning to think that ship 's navigators take their antique craft for hallucinatory phenomena . The course was a little over nine miles ? to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ida Lewis Yacht Club where the stake chamBY GEORGE PLIMPTON 47 pagne was waiting , along with Mrs. Lighter 's dispensing cup . Black Pearl crossed the finish line nearly fifteen minutes ahead of Flevo , which halfway down the last lap switched on her engines full-power ? the excuse being that those aboard felt that extreme measures were called for to assure that they were on hand for the dispensing of stakes . Senator Pell was asked to officiate at the prize ceremonies , to award the stakes , and be the first to utilize the cup . He declined , presumably on the grounds that his constituents might disapprove of photographs of him standing on a yacht-club lawn quaffing champagne from a silver tankard . When photographs were taken , Pell kept shrubbery between himself and the photographers . As for the champagne , he had that out of a Dixie Cup . H O M E A R D bound , with one victory out of five races , the Australians could reflect on mistakes made during the series ? some of them tactical , and one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luck , their decision to call a postponement or lay-day after every race , thus sacrificing , as it turned out , crisp sailing weather perfectly suited to their yacht 's design . Mainly , though , the Australians with fine justification can blame the loss of the series , not on their errors , but rather on the brilliant performance of their rival , Emil ( Bus ) Mosbacher , the American skipper . Traditionally , for over a century , defending skippers have troubled the dreams of challengers . The figure of the great professional Charlie Barr ? the laconic Scotsman who hand-motioned his enormous crews into action ? was recurrent in Sir Thomas Lipton 's dreams as destroyer of his lovely green Shamrocks . The towering J-boats Rainbow and Ranger , with Commodore Vanderbilt at the big-spoked wheel , discomfited the rest of T.O.M . Sopwith , owner and skipper of the two unsuccessful Endeavours . And now Bus Mosbacher ? deeply-tanned under a long-brimmed yachting cap , his pleasant-featured face split with a bizarre grin of white grease smeared across his lips to keep them from blistering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And yet , as has always happened , these faces fade , to be replaced by the outlines of the ugly , odd-proportioned silver pitcher , bottomless , worthless even as a container , yet as beguiling nonetheless as a Siren , emerging to entice energy , time , money , and finally competition in its name off the shores of Newport ... .
