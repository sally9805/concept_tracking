A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum was one of the hottest burlesque shows that ever hit Broadway . It had a grossly libidinous libretto snippeted out of the plays of Plautus , and lickerish leerics that read like Pompeian graffiti . Above all , it had a huge round Zero named Mostel , who wore a fingertip tunic the size of a pup tent and went tippety-skipping about the stage like a bull walrus in drag . <P> The movie has all these things and plenty more . It has Color by Deluxe , some charmingly scummy urbs and suburbs , a hilarious " sitdown orgy for 40 , " and a bunch of top bananas : Phil Silvers cast as a pious pimp who combines worship and whoreship , Jack Gilford playing a collector of " erotic pottery , " the late Buster Keaton doing a deadpan dad with a somewhat unusual problem : " My daughter is a eunuch ? " <P> Unhappily , Director Richard Lester ( A Hard Day 's Night ) sells his mirth-right for a mess of footage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ errors in which three men and two women paired off in most of the possible permutations . A direct director could have reduced complexity to clarity ; but Director Lester , with his scatty continuity and wham-bam camerantics , has about the same effect on this picture as a dachshund puppy might have on a game of chess . <P> What matters more is that the Lester manner conflicts with the Mostel style . Caught up in the director 's web of whimsies , this most projectively physiological of comedians subsides like an elephant conquered by cobwebs . Not once is Hero Zero permitted to charge the camera , as he charged his Broadway audiences , with the massive animal aggression that is the essence of his comedy and the soul of slapstick . <P> In his quieter moments , however , Mostel comes through beautifully . As a prospective purchaser , he examines a leggy pair of twin slaves like a prosperous matron examining a pair of table lamps , and then earnestly inquires : " I do n't suppose you 'd break up a set ? " And as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine Falernian and asks sniffishly : " Was 1 a good year ? "
