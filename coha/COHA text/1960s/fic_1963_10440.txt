them ( if you were walking on the other side ) bellowing and pausing now and then to paw the ground . Michael says this is to veil himself in dust and make the flies get off of him . With Michael , the animal is always right . Cricket could see a person moving two miles away and would begin to bellow and make his way to them with an air of terrible deliberateness . This , say the books , is showing a good herd instinct . A proper bull must be on the alert to protect the herd , resent intrusion of strangers , be ready to charge . Cricket certainly resented intrusion and gave every evidence of being ready to charge . One summer when Eugenie and little Jean were at the ranch , they went fishing down in the Calf Pasture . Nobody happened to remember , when they started out , that Cricket was in that pasture . They arrived back at the house hysterical with fright . Cricket had seen them as they walked along the stream ; came hurrying up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they fled , followed close behind them . They ran . Eugenie 's hook caught in Jean 's dress , and Jean 's in Eugenie 's . Jean began to scream . Michael and I agreed that Cricket would have to go . No use waiting until something terrible had happened . So , in town one day , Michael spoke to the Hebrew Rabbi to whom we sell our beef . When the Rabbi came out to make the appraisal I drove him in the car to a vantage point on the hillside above the pasture ; and we sat in the car looking down at Cricket a quarter of a mile away . The Rabbi wanted me to take him on foot into the pasture . " But he 's dangerous , " I said . " I 'm not afraid of bulls . " " You wait a moment . Wait until he catches sight of this car up here . He 'll know there 's a stranger in it . " The next moment Cricket saw us . He became motionless , his head alertly raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started40in our direction with that terrible deliberateness , never taking his eyes off us . Presently he paused , lowered his head , pawed the earth and bellowed . I do n't know how lions sound bellowing on their native heath , but I have heard them in the zoos ; and the sound is nothing to the deep belching roar , breaking to a furious squealing falsetto that is the bellowing of an angry bull . " He ca n't get to us . There 's a fence between , " I said . " But I ca n't appraise him without getting closer to him  --  much closer . " So I drove down and around to the fence on the far side of the pasture where the ground is , flat . We got out and stood against the fence . Cricket , twenty feet away on the other side , was quiet now that he had us under his eye . The Rabbi was guessing at his weight . He crawled under the barbed wire fence and walked closer ; Cricket lowered his head a little . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looking him over . Cricket circled too , keeping his head low . I kept my eyes on both . " Eighteen hundred pounds , maybe , " said the man at last , and turned his back and walked toward me . " Run ! " I screamed as the bull charged . One backward glance , and the Rabbi exploded into huge leaps ; he dropped to the ground and rolled under the fence . As he stood up and brushed his clothes off he said , " You tell the mister to kill that bull . Do n't bring him to me alive . I do n't usually allow an animal to be brought to me dead , but that bull is likely to kill someone if he ai n't killed first . " So now I have the Roamer who moans instead of bellowing , and runs away , but has never charged anyone . StillHe was waiting there at the fence for the cows to come up from pasture for milking . I saw them coming , scattered , some lagging , still nosing at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They had fed all day . Their stomachs were full . Many of them stood relaxed , chewing their cuds. 41As I walked across the corral to open the gate and let them in , the Roamer jumped the fence into the corral . The short chain did not impede him at all . I saw how he did it  --  just tossed the chain up by a swing of his head and in those few seconds before the chain fell again , his great weight lifted easily over the fence sideways , like an expert college hurdler , and dropped lightly on the near side . I stood at the gate while the cows filed in . The Roamer stood still , watching me . I made a bee-line for the barn door , but quietly . ( No panic . ) His head turned slowly ; his dark eyes , troubled , puzzled , crafty , never left me . Then he moved to the small wooden box where his grain ration would be poured and sniffed it . In the barn I found Felix and Missy , already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment heard the clattering of milk pails and the voices of Riley and George as they came down from the bunkhouse to milk . I 'm sitting on the terrace with my portable on my knees , just looking at the Green and enjoying it and being glad that we did n't build the house somewhere removed from the farm activitiesbut right here in the middle of everything. 42Chapter 6The well has come in with a fine flow . This is a triumph ; but the inlet is so low the water will have to be pumped up to the level where all the pipes are . This means a windmill . It will cost two or three hundred dollars . There is another worry . Just where shall it be placed ? Everyonehas a different opinion , and all the talk is about underground waters and overground air currents . The bed of Lone Tree Creek is the very lowest level of the ranch . From that the meadows and range sweep northward to the railroad tracks . It rises southward , too , in a series of swoops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it just big enough to hold our ranch . Wonderful shelter ! Then up again across pastures and county road to a higher ridge , long and undulating . This is the saddleback . Then another scoop and more and more , each one with a crest of a different line and color all the way to the Buckhorn Mountains of Colorado . Behind all , towering , sunlit , the NeversummerRange , snow-covered most of the year . That cut in the first ridge is a cosy spot for our ranch . It is shaped like an hourglass and our gorge is the narrow waist of it . Through the gorge runs a foot path and a trickle of water . The fairly steep timbered hills that enclose it on either side widen out for the stables above and the ranch building and Green below . Because it is a passage of the winds , we hang our meat there when we have butchered and have a sheep or side of beef to keep . We put it in a cage of fine wire mesh and hang the cage from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the wind and the meat is preserved from flies and birds and dries and43cures richly . This is where Michael wants to put the windmill . But old George insists the windmill must be high up on one of the timbered hills , not down in the gorge . And Michael says that cinches it  --  it must be in the gorge because George is always wrong . George resents Michael 's authority and acknowledges an orderwith a sort of mumbling snarl . But when he speaks to me his voice is so changed it is almost hushed . To western men , chivalry is very real . They have gentleness and deference and tenderness toward " the missus . " Nothing could make them give it up . George 's teeth are very large , very store-bought , very assertive . He has no hair at all . Teeth and bare skull conspire to give him the look of a death 's head . He would tell you he 's a cowboy . In his day , he has been . Even today he likes to catch up old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , step into the long stirrup from the top of a rock , and go ambling about . On most ranches ( all except the big beef-raising outfits ) " cowboy " and " hand " are synonymous . George is now a " hand . " We inherited him when we bought the ranch , like the IZ and the Jewish A. In the winters , if we do n't need him here , he gets a job in town as janitor of a small hotel . In the zero temperaturesand the heavy snows he is in the cosy dry basement ; he sleeps on as good a bed as he has ever known and near the furnace . He eats from the hotel kitchen . His personal needs  --  tobacco and occasional replacement of blue jeans , shoes and lumberjacks  --  are supplied by his salary . The salary is fifteen dollars a month . Now Michael has taken the three drillers to town in the car and the place seems very quiet . The windmill , Michael has decided , will be in the gorge . George goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have started to put it up . I can not rest . I change my clothes , wash my hands  --  change my clothes , wash my hands44This is a sign of mental confusion and always afflicts me when I move from one habitat to another . Apparently I am a limpet . Give me a chance to cling , and how I will cling . I marvel at myself . I simply can not stand the days ; suddenly can not stand this life or any life . The endless flux ; endless search , change , restlessness ; nothing ever right , nothing truly assuaging . I thought I was coming home , but it does n't feel like home . I think it 's the music . To write stories or music one withdraws from life and becomesan observer , an onlooker . When one has , in this way , been adrift in dreams too long one can not get back . I would like to be anchored . Right in this house , this chair , this dress ; and eat and feel warm or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I know I will . A tide of cosmic misery wells up inside me and my dis-ease becomes acute despair . I tell myself that I am simply making adjustments . For four . months I have been a certain woman , living at a certain pace , among certain vibrations , in a certain locality . Now all is changed , and not the least of the changes is that I am lifted from sea level to this high altitude , called by the trainmen of the transcontinental railroads , the big hill . This is their quaint name for the Rocky Mountain Divide . So I start to put the laundry away and lose it ; find it fifteen minutes later on the dining room table ; find myself standing before my bureau drawer , hunting and hunting , and suddenly realizeI. do n't know what I 'm hunting for . I go up to the corral to see what horses are in , and up there remember what I was hunting . I return  --  have forgotten it again . I open the drawers and look ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands . . . two of the yearling colts are missing . Michael and Riley have been riding for hours , hunting them. . . . every day I struggle with clothes . Blue denim Levi 's are classic on a western ranch ; but when new they are stiff and heavy , and even when softened by wear and washing they are tight  --  I have heard it joked that you need a button hook to get into them . So I wear linen jodhpurs of different shades  --  blue or45white or tan . These have to be bought in New York , as nothing of that kind is worn in the west except by " dudes . " Then the leather belt and gloves , jodhpur boots and a linen hat ( I never go out without a hat to keep my hair from blowing away ) and it is a lot to have to wear just to go up to the stables . Long before the day is over I 'm tired out by my clothes . After all , you associate very intimately with your clothes  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has to like them . If Michael does n't like my clothes he just gives them away . One fall in Los Angeles a friend came to see me and I sat looking at her dress , puzzled by something familiar about it and finally I cried , " Why that dress ! I have one just like it ! I bet you bought it at Robinson 's ! " And she gave a little shriek and said , " Why , Mary , it 's your dress ! ' Michael gave it to me . Did n't you know ? " In New York I had to shop hurriedly for New York clothes . And I did make some plans for the ranch , some things half made to be supplemented with this or that . But then came Joy in the Morning and I have forgotten all I planned . I look at a bundle of material rolled up with a string around it , and ca n't think what was to have been done with that . I get on a cotton skirt , socks and sandals and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; then ransack all my drawers and find nothing suitable to top it with . No sweater is the right color . The halter I bought in New York to go with it turns out not to fit . Besides , it looks like a piece of underclothing . So I 'm back in jodhpurs and spurs again , and the contents of my chest of drawers are spread over my room . I have been to town to put in an order at the employment office for a cook . I saw a man about selling some of my cows , as I have more than I need . I bought supplies . I went to the nursery and bought all the plants for the window boxes and flower pots . Two scarlet geraniums for the two little brackets under the pine room windows ; a dozen dark salmon geraniums for the long ultramarine-blue window boxes ; two vinca vines for46the wall pots on the front of the house where the pergola over the terrace gives us an outdoor living room . Then a mixture of things for the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and which now hangs from the pergola . One ivy , one vinca , a lantana , pink and white phlox , ageratum , purple and rosy morn petunias , and a single zinnia of an unusual cerise shade. . . . now I have planted the flowers and , as I write , am sitting out on the terrace under the pergola . It has not yet got its summerawning on , and when I look up I see the pretty square lattice against the cloudy sky . The Dutch oven , hanging at the edge , looks charming with all the new plants crowded into it and dripping over the sides . The grass on this terrace was so long Michael turned some horses on it last night . I heard them climbing up and down the stone steps , clumping about , squealing , knocking over chairs . Today , the terrace is shaved clean . Michael has been over it with the trimming shears . Tonight we will put the sprinklers on it . The flower border is full of light-blue meadow iris . The four big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Up here , with the high altitude , the seasons are two months or so behind New York . This year the spring has been unusually late ; the frost was hardly out of the ground before the end of May , and Michael only yesterday weeded and hoed the borders and dug up the ground around the lilac bushes . The big cloud is right overhead and thunder is rolling . Milking time again , and the cows are standing in the pasture near the corral , lowing . The Roamer is with them , of course , and now and then gives that deep moan . Three tiny calves are tied on the Green . Since something keeps their mothers away from them they are dejected and stand with hanging heads . The dogs are lying near me . Bunny , the brown cocker , and Rachel , my white setter . She is eight months old . I sent her to the ranch from Los Angeles when she was a baby of three47months  --  a highly bred , valuable Llewelyn setter . I wanted a dog big enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as Bunny 's little short legs get tired . I thought a setter would be just right . But Michael had to leave the ranch soon after her arrival , and she has grown up with no training and no manners . Hardly knows her name ! Knows only one thing , that life was made to do as you please in , and this means , for her , to run and run and run . And the more you are called and commanded to return , the faster you should run away . As a result , she is as thin as a little snake . And nervous and timid and wild . Michael is apologetic . The damage was done before he got back to the ranch . He has tried locking her into the tool house for days at a time , and she did eat better and picked up a little , but to keep a young dog shut up is not fair . I look at Rachel , quite despairing of her ; and as if she knew it , she rises , drops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bunny , so overjoyed to have me back , bursts into ecstatic tail-waggings every time I move or look at him . Tomorrow I shall go to town again to get the cook , whose name is Etta Biggs , and on the same trip take down our yearling steer to have butchered , hung and stored for beef for us , during the summer . It has rained . I moved in with the typewriter . Michael and Riley have returned . They did not find the two lost colts but spent an hour mending fence . Michael looks burned , hard as nails , happy , and about twenty years younger than he really is . He has the physique of a college athlete . The rain stopped and the sun came out and there was a rainbow . " How , " demanded Michael , " did all that short grass get into the bathtub ? " " Well , the terrace is covered with short grass ; and after I had48my sun bath on it this morning , I went up to the bathroom and rubbed myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of the grass you had cut was sticking to me . " " You must n't do that . The grass will wash down the pipe and clog it . " " But it was just a little bit of short grass ; and the pipe 's so big  --  " I made a big round with my hands . " So big , " he corrected , making a small round . " I was going to scoop it up anyway . " " You do n't have to . I scooped it up . " " Thanks . Am I a disorderly person ? " " Well , I would n't call you exactly orderly . " " My room 's tidy right now . " " Well , you 're not disorderly either  --  but it does n't matter . A little disorder is permitted , you know , to a genius . " There was a twinkle in his eye and good-humored mockery in his voice . " Well , anyway , " I declared , " you have n't got any ticks on you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his bare back for ticks . The other day , working on the dam in the meadow , he got two ticks . I kissed him good night . " How about you ? " he asked . " I have n't got any either . " " How do you know ? " " I 'd hear them ticking . " I grinned . " Will it keep you awake if I go down and play the piano ? " " Not a bit . " " I 'll shut your door . " " You do n't have to . I like it . " This kind word for my music warmed my heart , and I played an hour or two . Typed some more . I 'm going to bed now . I feel more calm than I did . I do n't like ticks . I do feel itchy. . . 49Chapter 7No chance yet to tell Michael about my music . Communication  --  I think of the African drums that shake a countryside just to communicate a tidbit of gossip . Or the Indian sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be told . Sometimes the mere meeting of eyes delivers a shock of communication that can hardly be borne . It links us , one to the other . So we must tell . Until I do , if it 's only to pages of paper , it does n't seem quite to have happened to me . So now I shall put it all down in this journal . All my life I have been making things . Houses and gardens to live in . Things to wear and things to eat . And love and marriages and children and many Hollywood screenplays . But not , so far , a serious career as a composer . Some time ago , I received a letter from Vernon Spencer , saying in effect , " If you have n't lost the urge to compose , or the ability , you ought to get at it again as there is now a good market for teaching pieces but very few good pieces . It is a crime  --  what they put out for children to learn . You have a charming vein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn up your nose at the idea , so get busy ! " There are two photographs of Vernon Spencer in my desk . One , as what the Germans call a jungling  --  and how dear a word , especially if translated youngling . It is the picture of a sixteenyear-oldboy , or eighteen , possibly twenty . He has an arch , bright expression ; candid expectant eyes behind studious spectacles , amazing big ears sticking out like small sails , and a sweetnessover the whole face that is benign and almost beautiful. 50The other picture ( as he is now ) is not beautiful and there is no resemblance to the youngling . This is what unremitting intellectuallabor , plus genius , does to a face . If one did not know him a genius his signature in the right-hand corner of the picture would be proof of it . No one but a genius could write like that . But in Los Angeles and Hollywood , proof is not needed . He is the maestro . Besides , he admits it . Recounting some achievementof his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't it ? " Above the signature he has written a characteristic gibe , To the only Mary I have ever loved . I gave his suggestion considerable thought , then decided I still had the urge and the ability , and if there was even a faint prospect of a market , I would certainly get busy . So I wrote eighteen teaching pieces , and now Schirmer has accepted four . For years Spencer has been begging me to stop composing long enough for him to teach me how to compose . . . . You should have studied as a schoolgirl , a child ; did no one recognize your talent ? Was there no one interested ? And I hear my father 's voice from long ago : " If you will only be serious about your music , Mary , I will not insist on your graduating from school ; and when you are old enough I will send you to Europe to study . " But I was not serious about a career . I just loved music as I love breathing air and living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be at least as distinguisheda composer as Chaminade . " I simply could not believe this for when I was a girl I and all my friends were playing Chaminade . The Flatterer , The Scarf Dance . Why !  --  she was famous on two continents . I had first gone to Spencer because I already had a big pile of compositions and hoped to get them published . He examined some themes I had written and burst out , " Every one a gem ! Valuable work which , if developed , would be instantlyaccepted by any publisher . I ca n't stop playing them . Take this thing . Make a climax here , like this  --  simply superb ! With a male chorus singing that it will lift you off your feet ! " But he qualified his praise . There were faults in all of them , he said ; phrasing omitted ; rests placed incorrectly and not of51proper duration . As they were they could not be published . Therefore , I must  --  I simply must  --  study . I had no choice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn all I needed to know . It made me feel faint . I could not see myself as a career woman . I already had two children . But the divorce  --  that had changed things somewhat . It had left an emptiness . Perhaps some sort of serious work . . . So I placed myself under Mr. Spencer and he began me on four-part harmony . They always begin with that . The four parts are the four human voices , soprano , alto , tenor and bass . Hymns and chorals . Sung by oratorios or chorale societies or church choirs , these are magnificent . There probably were no happier moments in my childhood than when I stood in my father 's church , singing the well-known melodies , watching my brother Reese up there in the choir  --  the soulful look in his eyes under the soft straight blond bang , mouth wide open above the black windsor tie , hymnbookin both hands  --  and all the rest of the choir , men and boys , so ordered , so dramatic in their black cassocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great and glorious roar going up . But choirs and organs are not accessible for practice at home , nor for lessons in the teacher 's studio . And the music as written in hymnbooks for just four notes is unattractive on the piano . If you could use all ten of your fingers instead of four , and all over the keyboard instead of only two octaves , it could be made to sound like something . But no  --  just four fingers . And to accomplish this meager and miserable sound you have to memorizeinnumerable rules and exceptions to rules . Arduous , unpleasant and unrewarding . All the same I worked very hard . Spencer was excited by my work and said I was covering what would ordinarily be five lessons in one . After six weeks the baby got diphtheria and I was quarantined for two months . Lessons had to stop . During quarantine I had fun , composing . I completed six teaching pieces for piano as Spencer advised , and sent them off52to John Church Company . To my surprise they were accepted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little more advanced . These were also accepted , and the largest music store in Los Angeles completely filled its window with the compositionsof this new composer . Spencer called me up and told me to go downtown and look at it . I stood before that big store window marveling , not believing it was really me . I decided to continue my study with Spencer . But just then I received an offer from Metro to go on their staff as special reader . The salary made the greatest difference in my small household . I began to look ahead and see good private schools for the children , summer vacations , . . . And from that I went to scenario writing , ten years of it , with surprising success . Then my marriage to Michael , and never again an opportunity to study composition with Vernon Spencer or any other . But I continued composing . I could n't help it . We have kept in touch . He has never ceased to exhort me . But in late years there has been less peremptoriness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has changed the tense . He no longer says , If you would only study  --  he says , If you had only studied . Is it then really too late ? This challenges me . A girl marries , has children , makes a home , brings up the children . Pretty soon half her life is gone . The children like birds crowd to the edge of the nest and fly away . My daughter , in Los Angeles now under the care of her father , is studying piano with Vernon Spencer , studying voice under Mara Kempbal ; she has a voice like an angel and red hair and long legs and sings in the choir and her two first names , like mine , are Mary O'Hara but we call her Pat . And my son . Before he went to West Point he was all long loose legs and arms . They seemed without bones . To see him put his six feet two into a chair one wanted to lean down and lift certain parts he had left behind and help him get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I visited him at the Academy , we were walk-53ing around and suddenly he said in his dreamy way , I think we 're going to get caught . He explained the ceremony of the sunset gun and the lowering of the flag . As he spoke there was the boom of the gun . His hand snapped to the salute and his body faced around and froze to attention  --  my ungainly colt and his undisciplined arms and legs ! And so he stood , drawn up tight , molded to significance , every inch of his body obedient , while the National Anthem was sung and the flag lowered and I struggled with tears . Anything beautiful makes me cry . So now , it 's no longer I who buy his clothes for him ( that magnificent uniform ! ) . And those three years of study that would be needed to make me a second Chaminade  --  I have them now . But more would be needed than time . Money would be needed  --  a good deal . Spencer is an expensive teacher . He has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is built on a steep hillside overlooking barancas , hills , and those abrupt craggy peaks that shoot up on the edge of Los Angeles , making everything look like an illustration on a poster . His studio is a long room with one side half filled with plate glass through which he can see that extraordinary view . He sits at the grand piano , a little left of center middle and gazes out that window while his hands are on the keys . To the left of him is a second grand piano , the Erhard , for the pupil . ( For me ? ) But we are economizing . And even if I were for a sufficient part of the year in Los Angeles , it would be pure self-indulgenceto place myself at the Erhard for a course of lessons . There is something else . One hears that to train a musician who is already composing is not always wise . For , they say , if first you compose , then go to school , you will learn rules , a dictionary of musical terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any more . ( Always this strange opposition between knowing and doing . ) In New York one winter I heard of a man called Bleeker , organist and teacher of teachers , and wanted to hear some of his lectures on improvisation . I called him up , a little at a loss54how to introduce myself , and said , " Well  --  I 'm a composer  --  I 've had a number of things published , but I 'm very ignorant , and I  --  , , I was interrupted by his chuckle . " An ignorant composer ! That 's the only kind there are ! " On the other hand , the editors of all the publishing houses are graduates of the music schools ; they catch the least divergence from the rules , and it is by them that my compositions are judged  --  either accepted or refused . So I am buffeted from one position to the other . One thing I know . I am in confusion and uncertainty . The music keeps pouring out , but anyone can convince me it is worthless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So , in New York , I did two things . I went to Schirmer 's and inquired about text books . Whose books , whose system of study was best ? Dr. Percy Goetschius , I was told , the strictest teacher of all , the one from whom all other methods derive . I have a picture of him , the distinguished , earnest , kindly , bearded , German face ; and underneath the picture , the list of his university degrees and achievements in the world of international music . He , like Spencer , is a graduate of the Leipzig Conservatory . One hears that brains deteriorate as one gets older . Well , I could put that to the test this summer . Perhaps one is slower , memorizes less easily , but youth has disadvantages too . It is preoccupied with the biological urge . It takes everything seriously , especially itself . It is apt to be touchy . It gets its heart broken . It has much to lose ; it must succeed . But let the years accumulate , and disappointments and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For is not everythinglost already ? Anyway  --  determination 's the thing  --  I ordered the books . Tone Relations , Lessons in Form , Elementary Counterpoint , Applied Counterpoint . They were to be sent to me at the ranch . The other thing I did was to write Spencer and suggest thatsince he has a sixteen-year-old son , and I have this summer camp55for boys , would he not like to send Jimmie here for the camp term and so arrange a credit for me against lessons next winter in Los Angeles ? . . . ca n't wait for his answer to come . . " What 's your letter ? " asked Michael , bursting out of the door . I was sitting in the hammock , the mail in my lap , a broad grin on my face , already seeing myself seated at the Erhard in Spencer'sstudio . Michael held a sandwich in both hands . Chopped onion and a fried egg between pieces of rye bread . So then I told him about everything , the pieces Schirmer had bought , and that Jimmie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's letter . Please let me have a list of what Jimmie will need . . . linen , blankets , toilet articles , clothes . . . bedroll ? Rifle ? And if you have any new compositions ready for criticism send them so that extensionlessons can begin immediately " So you see , " I finished , " that will mean a credit , and music lessons from Spencer for me next winter when I am in Los Angeles . " " How big a boy is he ? " asked Michael finishing his sandwich and going down the stone steps . " Small for sixteen . " Michael got the shovel and went about cleaning the manure off the Green . " By the way , I 've had Madame Pompadour brought in and put in the Stable Pasture for you . " " Oh , good ! " " Be careful . She 's been on the range all winter . " " I know . " Pom is a dark blue roan . Almost grape-colored , with a full black tail and mane and the wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many horses that have spent their lives on these upland ranges . She is nervous . She bolts . She runs away . Sometimes she rears and goes over backward . We forgive rearing , which is just exuberance , but falling over backward is going to extremes , and we do n't like it . I am crazy about her . She has wonderful gaits . We are good56friends . I am , to my chagrin , very soothing to all horses . When Michael rides them they are gathered , they prance , side-step and appear to be on the point of exploding . Michael put the shovel away . " I think , " he said , " if Jimmie Spencer is a little fellow , that dark , three-year-old bay would be about right for him . " " The mare ? " " Yes . I forget what you named her . " " Princess . Prinny for short . But she 's not broken yet . " " No . I 've got to get at those broncs right away . " I sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was setting . Long level rays struck the opposite cliff . I heard the clatter of some shale and small rocks cascade down into the rivulet at its base  --  some horses are picking their way across the face of it and now I see the blaze of gold on their bright hides . Michael is always wondering if he could not somehow lift that water to the top and persuade it to leap down in a long archingribbon of whitewater . When the moon rises , we see it first over the cliff there  --  just the thin gold edge . Then as you watch , it pushes up and in less than a minute it is sitting there , a big round golden Japanese lantern with the black branches of the jack pines laced across it . How fast the earth spins57Chapter 8Driving out yesterday with Etta Biggs , my new cook , she suddenlysaid , " Thing that worries me is , are you and I going to clash over the food ?

" " Well "  --  I hesitated , thinking of some of the heavy floury gravies , like paste , the thin , dry , fried steaks , the heavy f apjacks  --  " perhapsthere are just a few things I would like done differently ; steaks , gravies , and so on . But supposing I just tell you if there 's anything I would like different . Otherwise , do it your own way . You do n't mind being told , do you ? " " Not if you tell me nice like , " she answered with dignity . Then she told me about herself . Most of her bodily ailments , she said , came from not having been properly taken care of when her children were born . The story expanded and grew , and it appeared that every single misfortune that had come upon her was due to neglect , or abuse . She fairly blazed with indignationover all that had been put upon her ; and put upon others too . People on relief rolls should get more money . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . " And not so skimpy , neither . It 's more than just rent and food and clothes they need , by the time they have their laundry sent out and something for pocket money  --  " I listened . " And the thing that makes me the maddest , " she said , " is when I see people having one child right after the other . I could just get right up and fight  --  what right have they to make these58children be born ? I know I never forgave my parents for having me. , , " Are you really sorry you were born , Etta ? " " I sure am . If I 'd had anything to say about it , I would n't have chose the parents I had ; they never gave me no advantages . And if I 'd known as much as I do now , I 'd never have had no children myself . " " Would n't you really ? " " I sure would n't . Whenever I see a hearse going by , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's luck for you . Why could n't it have been me ? " Whether or not it was this conversation that caused my morale to slip , I do not know . At any rate , I found myself again in the same dreary confusion I had been in a day or so before . After having settled Etta in her quarters and given her directionsfor supper , I wandered out to find Michael . I found him submerged in the problem of finding a particular shape and size of a bit of lead pipe to make the fountain fount . He sat in the tool house over a pile of junk , fingering this one , then that one , muttering to himself . I sat down nearby , discouraged . One might as well have hoped for small talk from an Indian Yogi . I began to mutter to myself , too . " As long as Porn is in the corral , I would go for a ride if it were n't so foggy and cold . " He pricked up his ears at mention of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fog stop you ! " I sat thinking , and he again fell into his abyss . I wandered away . I went slowly upstairs , intending to wash my hands , I pulled myself up short . " None of that ! " I said . With determination I got into riding clothes . The cold was really bitter . I put on a woolen polo shirt , over that a sweater , over that a leather jacket , and pulled my woolen ski cap on my head . Pom was very fresh after her long free winter on the range and it was all I could do to hold her . First I took her down into the Home Meadow , for I wanted to practice some jumps on her . I made her jump the creek where59it 's narrow there , back and forth a couple of dozen times , and I found out what it is that unsettles me with this horse . It 's the way she abruptly changes her gait for the take-off rather than the jump itself . But Pom wanted to go , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so I left the meadow for the upper ranges where the fog would be thinner and I would have a chance to look for the lost colts . I had asked Riley which they were . Playboy and Floss . Those two beautiful little sorrels , inseparable friends . You never saw one without the other . I rode upward through the Home Pasture  --  the acreage immediatelysurrounding the house and the Green . Wind was roaring in the pines on top of the cliff so that , as I rode through them , it sounded as if I were by the sea with an equinoctial surf in my ears . I felt the endlessness of the sea . The smell of the jack pines , wet in the fog and mist , was deliciousand clean beyond words . I breathed it deep . A bluebird , color of larkspur , became interested in us and followedalong , flitting from one bush to the next , keeping just abreast of us . Such a small thing , he . Such big things , Porn and I. But he had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head and peered at me . I peered back . I am always expecting to exchange greetings with the birds and animalswhen I meet their eyes . Sometimes , very rarely , it seems as if I do . And if it happens , something more happens  --  I feel a little pang and a bond is forged between us . I have often looked into the Roamer 's eyes but have never really met them . Because I am afraid . If I could do that we might be friends . I went on up through the Stable Pasture , crossed the county road and began to mount the saddleback . Porn 's body gathered and her pace quickened . She is tireless , carries me like a feather and would take hills at a gallop if I would let her . On the upland , the mists and clouds rolled about us . The wind still roared . It had a pounding rhythm in it , as if I held a shell to my ear and was really hearing that strange echo of surf and sea  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should delight me , 60but no  --  it is too big . It is epic , and when suddenly there was a break in the coiling fog and my glance pierced through , following undulations that went on to a distance no eye could reach  --  here again was endlessness  --  all  --  all so beautiful it whips the heart out of you and makes you one with it  --  but it is a graft ; done with a knife  --  blood and anguish . Rachel and Bunny had started out with me but were soon led away by their hunting instincts . Bunny showed up every so often , as if knowing that he was in duty bound , but after one or two flashes of Rachel through the fog , during the first mile of riding , running like a mad thing , I lost her , and Bunny and I went on alone . I pulled up near the crest of the saddleback and sat there a long time scanning the world , but saw no colts  --  no life at all . Porn looked too . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high places . Her body quivered . Her proud neck was straight up , her ears sharply pricked . I let the reins lie loose on her neck and she kept turning her head first in one direction , then the other , with small , abrupt jerks . But fog closed over us again . It was impossible to see . I returned to curl up in the corner of the sofa by a roaring fire with a book on rhythm by Lussy in my hands , and to wait to see what Etta would produce in the way of eastern cooking by suppertime. . . . very late . . . a little white ghost outside the door . Rachel . Muddy , bedraggled , thin and wild beyond description , her flanks heaving in and out , her tongue hanging like a long wet streamer from the side of her mouth . I have fired Etta and telegraphed to Hilda in San Francisco on the bare chance that she may still be able to come to me for the summer . Apologizing , Rachel creeps up to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Rachel it is too desperate a need . After a moment or two I take my hand from her head and tell61her to lie down . But , cringing , she creeps to Michael and begs of him . Then she 's off to Riley where he stands watering the Green . I have seen her at lunch time , seated between the knees of one of the windmill crew , basking and blissful under the heavy , fondlinghands . And if anyone raises his voice to her  --  let alone shouts  --  she goes into a state of shock . All children shout at dogs , and nearly every dog begins life in a home with at least one child in it . And in the country everyoneyells at them . One calls . They do not appear . One calls louder and louder , one shouts . If it is cold , standing there , and one has left a good program on the radio or an interesting book or conversation to come out there with the food and call the dogs , some impatience enters the voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At last one bellows . The dogs do not mind . When , having at last heard those calls , they come as fast as they can , tails are wagging , eyes are adoring , they are ready to leap and love and to be fed and caressed and taken inside and comfortably possessed . The shouts mean nothing to them . They are sure of the love that is underneath the noise . But Rachel minds . How can all this be stopped for her ? All the men call her and shout at her . How she skedaddles . How angry they get . I see her hiding somewhere in the shrubbery , looking out , seeing all , determined and ready to run away . Her timid manner , I am sure , comes not so much from fear as from guilt . She has no intention of obeying and is crushed by her own wickedness . She is not even properly house broken . In the country where doors are often open and everyone goes in and out , where dogs are outdoors more than in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own needs without asking permission . Strictly their own affair . And all 's well provided the doors do not by some mischance remain closed longer than usual . Rachel will have to be house broken and she will have to learn to come when she is called. 62I am planning a special call of my own to summon her , a sound that shall be nothing like all these other shouts and calls that she has been running away from for so long . I would like to use a whistle , but can not , as the horses are trained to come at a whistle . So I shall call her on two notes , two high chest tones , pitched on the fifth then the third of the scale of D major . This small third is a plaintive interval . Children , calling to each other from one hill top to another , are apt to use it . In Switzerland and Germany the yodels one hears bouncing from one mountain to another contain it . And I can always hit it exactly because orchestras tune on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm and clear . All the colors are intense . I 've been lying in the hammock at the end of the terrace , basking . No loneliness today . Respite . I like to catch a glimpse of Riley and George going here and there  --  barn , corral , spring house , bunkhouse  --  the sudden bursts of sound that drift down from the windmill crew  --  the slamming of a doorAcross the Calf Pasture , up on Number Sixteen , I saw a suddenflash of color  --  the yearlings streaming down over the range to the creek for water . They are the fastest things on the ranch . They do n't run , they just pour over the ground  --  across the little swales and draws  --  up or down hill means nothing to them ; sorrels , bright bays , chestnuts  --  they blaze with color when the sun strikes them . Now the day is waning and the light changing for sunset . Soft and lovely . No clouds . Just a clear emerald green  --  and the eveningstar big and golden . The windmill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the piano and certain sounds emerge which enthrall me  --  sometimes just a short progression of chords , or a change of key , or a bit of melody  --  I play it over and over , taking the most intense pleasure in it . A sort of hypnosis results ; at last I am oblivious of everything around me and I see visions , nature pictures : sea , mountain peaks , flower faces , sunsets . As a child , I called this going into another world , and knew that certain sounds let me into it . This would exhaust me emotionally . My father would look at me long and thoughtfully , and say , Mary , you look as if you had been drawn through a knothole . I would feel guilty and ashamed and hang my head . I always know when this is going to happen . I become intenselysusceptible and aware and know that I am going to enter that different world ( which now I call Shinar ) . The naturevisionsplay upon me with great power , sometimes frighteningly . The light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mood from dawn to dark . First that light of early morning which I have written about in Joy . So innocent and gay and heartfelt , with the birds singing all together in a rapturous concert , " Here it is again ! The day ! The sun ! And air and wings ! " The whole world a cup yearning upward , lifting and opening itself for more light , and more and moreAnd more light pours down until the vast outpouring of noon ; and then it begins to be cruel . No cranny is spared . In early afternoon it is crushing . No faintest line of shade . Then , slowly , the sun rays tilt a little and become oblique and each sharp edge64is softened by a thin strip of shadow . Now the whole world is etched with ever-widening lines of blue and purple ; and watching the shadows grow you begin to smile and wonder and feel a mystery . And through all the upper air is a breath of relief that softly deepens into sadness as the day wanes . Twilight is enchantment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birds sing dramatically in the twilight , one at a time , as if making important announcements . Quite often , out of one of these semi-hypnotized experiences at the piano , comes a new composition , as when I wrote Enchantmentof Dusk . I have often thought the piano itself has something to do with it . Not only the limpid beauty of tone and matched-pearl action , but something more . For this particular instrument is special . It has a history . It is a grand  --  the largest size the Mason and Hamlin company makes  --  and was selected out of stock by the famous composer and pianist Leopold Godowski for a young piano pupil of his . ( This was in Los Angeles , a good many years ago . ) The boy was considered a genius . The Polish father who supporteda whole brood of children by his position as typesetter on the Los Angeles Times made superhuman sacrifices and the piano was bought and installed in the living room of the little Hollywood bungalow where they lived . There was no other furniture in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch the piano or even enter the room . This piano and the boy were the whole promise of their lives . The future . For a year the boy studied with Godowski and the piano was never silent . Then it was closed and locked . Interested philanthropists , persuaded by Godowski , were takingcharge of the young genius . They would send him to Paris to be educated . When he returned he would be a world-famous virtuoso and would no longer need this piano . The greatest of the piano manufacturers would be vying with each other for the honor of supplying him with an instrument . In those years I too was living in Los Angeles , and I was looking for a piano as fine as the one on which I had played as a child . In the Brooklyn house where I grew up , music was taken very65seriously . This was because my maternal grandmother lived there with us , and she was as full of music as a rose is of perfume . She owned a harp and played it beautifully . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Bible and is preached about in church . Of course it is golden and encrusted with cherubs and angel heads . No one could possibly have been more suited to be the companion of cherubs and heavenly instrumentsthan my stately grandmother . Occasionally I was gatheredinto this celestial association by being placed on the floor as she played , delightfully mixed up with her long black silk train , and permitted to shift the pedals when the key was changed . There was another imposing instrument in that Brooklyn drawing room . This was a Steinway piano , concert size , a gift from my grandmother to Elma , who was studying piano " se-riously . " As soon as I was tall enough to stand alone and get my hands on those keys , I did so . To hear a fifth played low down on such a piano with the lid up is an experience for anyone who has ears to hear . For a musical child , for me , in those first years of my life , it was a quickening ; it committed me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to sit close beside her on the piano bench . As long as she would play I would stay there . She would glance down at me with her look of combined sweetness and quizzical amusement , and I would watch her hands and learn the tunes . And as soon as she had left the piano , start picking them out myself . I learned by listening . Soon I was playing many things by ear . Anyone who , from infancy on , has played on such a piano as that is spoiled for anything inferior . So when I married and moved to Los Angeles and rented a Knabe grand , I was soon dissatisfied , and sent it back and rented a Baldwin . Then sent that back and bought an old Chickering . I was still dissatisfied . I played on all the pianos in the Steinwaysalesrooms , but none compared to Elma 's . The music companiesand salesmen became accustomed to my search for just the right piano. 66One afternoon , playing there alone , I noticed a small door in a corner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attic . There was nothing in it but one piano . Here was the twin of Elm 's . Long , black , closed , majestic , waiting . It truly was waiting . This was the concert piano held in readiness by the Steinway people for visiting virtuosos . I slipped onto the bench , lifted the lid , and played that deep fifth , the low D and A. And there was the magical , reverberating sound that had awakened my soul in childhood . They let me play there as much as I wanted . One day a salesman called me to tell me he thought there was a piano in a little bungalow in the Hollywood Hills which would interest me . He told me how to get there , for there was no telephone . So the practice piano of the young Polish virtuoso ( who , alas ! never materialized ) is now standing in my living room here at the ranch . It was shipped from Los Angeles in a crate the size of a small hut , put off at the Buford station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work teams , Jock and Ginger , Fanny and Cap , drew it at a slow walk over the plains to the house where piano movers from Denver were waiting to set it up . Enchantment of Dusk was written late one fall soon after we had come to the ranch . Michael was ill when I composed that piece . I felt guilty , working so steadily at the piano , probably drivinghim half crazy when I should have been up there nursing him . So I went up and aired out the room for a few minutes , pullingthe covers up to his chin until I shut the window again . I freshened his pillows , brought him fruit juice , pulled up a chair and took my sewing . He turned his face to the wall . " Go down and play , " he said . " Do you like this piece ? " I asked at the door . " Yes . " " What do you like about it ? " No answer . He did not turn. 67I waited a while , then started to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a  --  lovely  --  free  --  wandering thing  --  " I cherished the words . When it was done I saw that it had glamor and a mood . It truly was pervaded by that strange light of dusk . There was enchantmentin it , and one of the birds calling in it was a hermit thrush . They are never near , never in your garden or on the edge of a woods , but always buried in the heart of it ; and someonehearing the piece cried , That bird ! so remoteMichael 's throat got worse . It was quinsy and his fever kept going up , so the day came when I helped him bundle up and I drove him to the doctor 's office in Cheyenne . Because there was no room to park I drove the car around and around the block while I waited . Michael went in and sat down in front of the doctor who is a great friend of ours , a Hungarian . He speaks perfect English but in a strange nasal whine . The doctor directed his small glaring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What  --  a  --  beauty ! " ( When Michael told me this afterward I knew just how he sounded . ) Then he picked up his lancet and the nurse moved in with the basin . In fifteen minutes Michael was on the street , holding a wad to his mouth and looking up and down the block for me . In bed again at the ranch , pillows behind him , a pain-killer inside him , an extra strong highball in his hand , the open fire flickering , and the delicious comfort of painlessness oozing from every pore  --  it did me good to look at him . The piece  --  Enchantment of Dusk  --  has had a small career . I took it to New York one year and offered it to the Sam Fox Publishing Company with an alternate title : Twilight and Birdcalls . Mr. Fox has music in his soul , and when his editor is playing a piece for him to hear , he walks up and down the studio , concentrating , listening intently , and illustrating the ideas that are68suggested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body . An enchanted dusk with birds calling in it would be quite difficult for even a trained actor to act , but Mr. Fox was nothing daunted . Tall , very handsome and always dressed in London-tailored tweeds , he stood quietly waiting while the piano performed the birdcalls . It was the dusk that intrigued him , and the enchantment . " Now this is the enchantment beginning , " he exclaimed and began waveringly to progress around the room , lifting his arms and allowing them to float about like seaweed under water . Then the piece traveled still farther . A friend of mine in Holland showed some of my piano compositionsto a Dutch piano virtuoso , Pierre Palla . He chose Twilightand Birdcalls and played it at a concert in The Hague. 69Chapter 10All the animals love music , I find . When I sit playing in the living room , the top half of the Dutch door is open . Beyond that is the narrow terrace held up by a two-foot dry stone wall ( beautifullylaid by Michael ) , then the flower border , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they come up onto the terrace , to the very door . Birds come , perch on the pergola , hop and twitter , and often burst into such loud singing it seems they are trying to drown my piano . Only since I have returned has music entered Rachel 's life . I think it astounds her . When , for a pause and a breath of air , I rise and go to lean on the lower half of the Dutch door and look out , there they are . Glancing down , I see both dogs on the door mat . " Why , here is Rachel ! " Bunny wags his tail violently . I brought her . Felix and Missy are sitting in the sun at the far end of the terrace washing themselves . There have been occasions when , sitting at the piano , I have turned my head and seen the pricked ears of young Rheingold at the door . No sign , as yet , of the lost colts . Today it is brilliantly clear . I shall try again . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Rachel , but would call Bunny to me . This was treachery , for Rachel , having followed Bunny from infancy , has the impulse to come whenever he is called . Michael would help me . Then we would grab her and lock them both into the tool house , and so I would save her from running still more flesh off her bones. 70But I was already in riding clothes . Would she notice ? She watched Michael as Bunny ran to him , and when Michael called , " Here , Rachel ! Here , Rachel ! " she turned and fled . Michael shouted commandingly . I shouted . Riley saw her streaking past the bunkhouse and he shouted . The men at the windmill shouted . Several darted out and tried to catch her as she whipped through the gorge . She ran low on the ground like a weasel , her long tail so far underneath her body it could have touched her chin . Michael lost his temper . A few more terrific shouts and we all acknowledged defeat . Rachel was sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point from which she could see everything , particularly the corral in which I was saddling Madame Pompadour , and from which she could take off speedily into the wide wide world if the slightest move were made to capture her . Riding up the mountain I wondered how I could make her love and obey me . I saw her streaking past . She raised her face to me , not triumphantly , but just so happy that the joy spilled over . She is mad for freedom , but she 's anybody'sdog . She has no confidence . The frightened , cringing , crafty , slinky way she looks around ! Like a wild animal without home or friend or owner . I let Pom go up the saddleback at a canter . Rachel was alreadyout of sight . High on a ridge behind Section Twenty I pulled up and sat scanning the world . Thirty miles east , in Cheyenne , there were slabs of pure gold in the sky  --  that 's the gold-leaf dome of the Capitol . Stretching both east and west was the railroad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiny toy trains . Going west , climbing the " big hill , " two locomotives pulled them  --  I could see the clouds of smoke ; but going the other way , east , that was downhill ; and they balled the jack and had no extra locomotive . It is a busy road . A train passes , so they say , every three minutes . I could see the white jacket of a Pullman porter as he stood on the dining car platform . Ringing the scene , far away , west and south , were the mountains  --  theSnowy Range , the Neversummer Range  --  so the In-71dians named them . Fourth of July they always have a ski meet in the mountains down there in Colorado . No storms today in any direction  --  just fleets of white clouds sailing  --  but straining my eyes to those far peaks , I saw there was wind there ; for as I watched I saw a feather of snow whip up , like smoke from a chimney ; and I knew it was a mountainside that had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and spread and whirl  --  yes , a wild wind  --  and then slowly disintegrate and melt away . All was calm again . I rode on , holding Porn to a walk . Suddenly she stopped , her head came up with a sharp jerk , and she whinnied . An answering whinny came from behind a low hill to my left . I squeezed my leg against her , we moved forward around the hill , and there was the whole band of yearlings , all heads up , watching us , ready to fly off . One little blue roan came out to meet us ; and suddenly he and Porn were in an excited dither of reunion . This was her yearling colt . The other colts milled about us . Rachel had found them long before I had , and was seated on the opposite side of the little draw , calmly watching . I had time , now , while Porn and the colt were nickering and playing around each other , to look over the others . Rachel vanished . The colts are always rough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come off in patches . Sometimes they have changed so in color and size during the winter that I can hardly recognize them . I expected two to be missing from the original sixteen , but , counting , made it fifteen . This puzzled me . I counted again . Fifteen . How could Playboy and Floss both be missing unless a strange colt had got in with our bunch ? Looking at the sorrels , one of them seemed to me remarkably like Playboy . But Floss , who had unusual markings , was undoubtedlymissing . Riding home , I smelled carrion on the breeze . The smell was strong . I drew rein and looked about , then saw Rachel on the brink of a little gully , looking down . I galloped up . There lay Floss . Hard to think that was all72that was left of the lovely little filly  --  the body already half rotted away , the hide burst , shrunken and dried , the teeth bared , the lovely cream-colored tail that had given her her name ( for it had looked like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matted switch . All sorts of things had been at the carcass . Mercifully , it was still half covered with unmelted snow . I reconstructed the accident . All the colts racing across the prairie together as they constantly do . The ground covered with snow . The gully partially or fully filled . Unable to see just where there was firm ground and where not , Floss makes the leap , either miscalculates or her foot slips or the bank gives way with her as she lands . And she 's down . Back at the corral I told Riley . " But there 's two missing . " " Only one , Riley . Playboy 's with the bunch . " " But we did n't see him . " " You were looking for the two together . When you did n't see Floss you figured he was gone too . But he 's there . " I unsaddled Pompadour . " How many colts was there ? " " Fifteen . " Riley scratched his head , mystified . He is a comic . He has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Irish face . I walked into the living room to find Michael standing before the fireplace , a wild look on his face . " I 'm in the doghouse . You came just in time . " " What 's the matter ? " " The windmill is up but it does n't turn . " " It does n't turn ! " I was aghast . Then remembered with relief , " But there 's no wind today . " " A little . Enough . It ought to move , but it does n't stir . Here is all this time lost , so much to do , no water in yet , and I do n't know what to do first , where to begin . Should I try to siphon the water ? Or buy a pressure pump ? " 73He had the Montgomery Ward book in his hand open to the page where the pumps were catalogued . He was distraught . My heart began to beat . I felt it was a catastrophe . " Floss is dead , " I said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Playboy 's with the bunch . " I wish the windmill would go . We stood and looked at the lazy windmill . Now and then , with a strong gust of wind , the arms would turn for a few moments , and pump a little water . " Yay  --  ay  --  ay  --  " Michael would shout . And I too . " Yay  --  ay  --  ay  --  " And the dogs came running at these strange sounds and leaped and barked and wagged their tails . Then it would turn slower and slower  --  become motionless . " Anyway , " I said , " it 's not a major disaster . " " It is a major disaster ! " " No . If we had drilled for water here , there and everywhere , and found none as many people do , that would have been a disaster . But we found this good flow without much drilling . Now if we ca n't pump it with the mill and lift it that way , we 'll lift it some other way . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here in two weeks and I 've got three horses to break and train before they come . " His voice was desperate . " It wo n't matter so much if the water is not running when they get here . The horses have to be broken  --  that 's important . " We have to get a windmill expert out ; see if eight-foot blades instead of six-foot will do the trick . If not , see if the water can be siphoned from the well into our spring , a pressure pump put into the basement of the house , the mill taken downWhen anything stumps Michael he gets sick . So this time he has neuralgic pains on one side of his face , a slight cold ; hoarseness . He has tried to siphon it . It wo n't siphon. 74He blames himself passionately for everything that goes wrong . " This time I thought I had taken every precaution ; gone over every possibility before I ordered the mill ; and still I was wrong ! " " But , " I cried , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You spotted the water all right ; that 's the main thing . And there always seemed a good draught of air through the gorge . " " I could have tried out the air currents more thoroughly . Should have . Could have run up flags there , day after day , to just that height , before ordering the mill . " So his cold gets worse . Old George goes around looking very smug . The windmill man has come with another " expert . " They have inspected it thoroughly , inquired into the reasons of its coma , taken pulse and temperature , decided that , after all , there would have to be a pump to lift the water from the well to the big tank on the hillside above , from which it will be piped down into the house . They retired with Michael and the Montgomery Ward cata- logue into his study to choose the pump . Michael wrote out the order and they took it to town to mail . Before leaving , however , they replaced the six-foot blades with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened . Michael , having ordered the pump , feels much better . His neuralgic pains are gone and his voice is as usual . He tells me happily that the pump will be in and the water running in the house by Sunday . This is of course impossible , as today is Wednesday and the pump wo n't arrive for several days . But at any rate , things are moving . Where is the good-looking , well-dressed man who met me at the bus station in Cheyenne when I arrived from New York ? His riding boots were polished and his whipcord breeches im- maculate . That thick blond hair flat and burnished with much brushing. 75Army life not only gives a man a fine physique and carriage , it is apt to make him a bit of a dandy , too . I thoroughly approve . Men need to enhance their appearance with clothes and groomingas much as women do . But besides grooming of course he is very good looking . Peopleturn to look at his hard bronzed face with the big whitetoothedsmile , those keen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , blunt and abrupt , is the giveaway of his temper . But now ! His work clothes consist of a battered , perspiration-stained hat ; baggy old trousers covered with patches and discolorations ; a drab gray flannel shirt open at the throat ; heavy , shapeless , square , fanner boots with elastic sides ; coarse white socks crumpled above them . I never see him when he is n't carrying a hammer , files , pieces of wood or iron . His handsome , square hands with their strange wide fingers are always grimy , always cut or bruised as he goes about setting things right for the summer ; rearranging the tool house , chicken house , stables , machinery . Besides the big things like the windmill and the horses there are endless details to be attended to . And when the work , for the moment , is over , he reacts into semicoma , sitting there by the radio smoking his pipe , motionless , staring , no light in his face , dark hollows under his eyes . Hilda has come . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in perfect order . The little sewing table by the window with yellow flowers on it . My desk , so neat , with all the papers tucked into racks . I have filled the rest of the house with flowers . This is because now we 're a team , Hilda and I. And you must pay attention to your team work . But when you 're alone , you can get very slack . I have been to town and bought three dresses for a dollar each . I have one on now  --  red , with a small white polka dot , a little sash in the back and a zipper all the way down the front . It is light , cool , easy to get into , and has an air of insouciance . So I feel insouciant. 76Chapter 11There are lots of fish in Lone Tree Creek and the water has not yet been taken out of it and diverted into the irrigation ditches that run along the shoulders of the meadows . This will be done when the dams have been repaired . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will pour down over the meadows and flood them and so force the hay . Until then the meadows are dry ; the brood mares and their foals and of course the stallion are still in winter quarters  --  the aspen grove at the far end of Castle Rock Meadow . The meadows , each one a long eliptical saucer , run the length of the ranch and are connected with dams . So if I do n't go fishing now before the meadows are flooded I 'll probably miss it altogether . The sky is overcast today ; good weather for fishing . The first thing to do was locate Missy . She is as determined to accompany me on my expeditions as the dogs are . I found her sound asleep in the corner of the sofa in the living room . She was on her side , curled up like a caterpillar , her innocentface slightly upturned , eyes tight shut and four little paws dangling and limp against the creamy fur of her belly . No human infant wakes when his mother moves him . Nor do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my hand lightly down Missy 's soft fur , from tip to tail , there was not the quiver of an eyelid . So I went out and called George and told him to dig me some worms . Michael would be surprised , I thought , as I started off , when we had trout for supper . I would tell Hilda not to cook them in corn meal , but just in salt pork fat and in the open air so they77would have the taste of wood smoke . The dogs appeared from nowhere , leaped all over me , then took off on a fresh rabbit trail . I know where the trout are , close under the bank at every turn . As I fished I was thinking back to the beginning of the ranch . It must have been this creek . Without the creek there would n't have been the dams . Without the dams there could n't have been the hay . Without hay , no Mary-Dairy , nor boys ' camp  --  in fact , no ranch . And I would n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strike and jerked my line out with a ten-inch rainbow trout on the end of it . Four things happened at once . Missy shot out of the bushes behind me and leaped at the wriggling sliver of silver . The trout fell off the hook . The dogs , unaccountably , were there , saw the trout go into the water and plunged in after it . I dropped my can of worms . As I stooped to gather them up I felt a Presence and turned to look . The Roamer stood behind me , watching , the short chain hanging from his nose . I stood petrified . The dogs came out of the water , got as close to me as they could , and shook themselves vigorously . From infancy on , one is taught not to show fear . One is even told not to be afraid ( and how silly this is ! ) . All the same I instantly knew that the Roamer had no evil intentions . He was curious . He saw that something was going on and he wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want to be left out . Animals are congenitally lonesome and seek companions . ( Unless they are sick . Unless they are about to die . Unless a female is about to give birth . ) In one other respect they resemble their human big brothers  --  they seek security . Let some human being take over , speak with authority , show willingness to seize and possess them , and they will fling the burden of themselves and their whole lives upon you with love and gratitude . As my fear subsided I turned to Missy with exasperation . She could and probably would spoil everything . If she accompanies me on a fishing trip she usually sits on the bank motionless , 78right under my line , her eyes directed down into the water . I think she can see the fish swim up , nibble , taste and take the bait . The moment my line jerks him out into the air she competes with me for possession . I called her , " Here , kitty , " my hand held out . She can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharp little cry of love . I lifted her and put her against my left shoulder , where she assumed her usual snuggling position with one arm flung around my neck . As I walked up the creek the Roamer followed and soon was joined by Rheingold , junior stud . The dogs ran ahead , torn between the desire to keep track of me , not miss anything , and yet be off on every hot scent . I took my stand at the next bend . The dogs sat down , watching me , their tongues hanging out , whimpering with eagerness for something to happen . But nothing happened , except , far away , some movement in the grass which I could not see , and they were off again . I now caught three beautiful trout in quick succession . Each caused a commotion because I had to protect the fish from Missy and get it off the hook and into my pocket . The last time I dropped everything , including Missy , fell on my knees , almost lying on the fish , Missy jumped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roamer gave a deep rumble , both dogs came dashing back , hot and panting , and lay down in the creek to cool off . From now on they dropped other interests and paid attention to fishing , running ahead of me upstream , spotting likely pools and bends . They would turn and look at me with bright inquiry , their tongues hanging out , and when I said grumpily , " No , not here , " they would proceed upstream with unflagging optimism . How I managed to catch two more fish ! I thought of supper . My mouth watered . A good mess of trout . I came at last to the fence between Crooked Meadow and Castle Rock Meadow . At the far end is the great towering pile , once , of course , a small mountain . Through the ages it has been consumed by erosion until it is stripped of everything except its rocky skeleton ; and there it stands , a turreted castle with battle-79ments and towers and many roomy caves underneath . Not too inviting , these caves ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in or devour a kill ; and they are full of skeletons , and odd pieces of bone and hair  --  here and there a skull ; always the ugly buzzing of blow flies . But the meadow is a beauty , not only rich with the leavings of last year 's hay , as they all are , but provided with fine shelter by the grove of young aspen which straddles the Creek at the far end , near the Rock . Standing where I was , my hand on the gate , I could see no sign of mare or colt , but I knew they were there . They must then be hidden in the aspen grove . It is well , on a ranch , always to remember just where you are , where the fences and gates are , and just what stock is in the enclosure with you . If I opened this gate and went into the meadow , my escort would expect to go with me . I turned and looked at them . The dogs knew they had to be patient while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faces lifted to me . Missy was in my neck . Roamer and Rheingold also understood I was thinking and were patient , hoping it would come to something . I knew that only by force or quick maneuver could I keep Roamer and Rheingold from following me if I opened the gate in the barbed wire fence . Blazes would come galloping up from the far end of the meadow to inquire who was invading his domain and probably eighteen mares and seventeen foals would accompany him . There would be wild nickering and whinnying , especially over the reunion of Rheingold and his mother Juanita . For Juanita is in the brood mare bunch . She is also Michael 's particular favorite mount , exactly balancedto his height , weight , style . She is really head girl . It was I who brought Juanita to the ranch . It was several years ago and we had too many dairy cows and heifers and not enough saddle horses ; and I told Michael that a dairyman had stopped me in town one day and said that he80had a saddle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd like to make the trade . Michael pronounced it an excellent idea and suggested that I inspect the mare and make the deal . I did not feel enough confidence in myself as a judge of horses to do anything so important , but Michael was too busy to bother ; so I arrived one day with car and trailer at the little dairy farm north of town looking with great doubt and some distress at a tall , raw-boned mare , which the owner assured me was broken to the saddle , but which he appeared afraid to mount . She was a rack of bones . Her hide would have been black had it not been for what seemed the dust and dirt of years ground into her . She had an ugly cyst on her nose , size of a big plum . But she was unusually tall , and it seemed to me , looking at her this way and that , that she had a fine head . Being by nature credulous , I believed the owner when he said she had been considerably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use to us than one of my spare heifers . Perhaps what decided me was the fact that she was in a parched hillside pasture without grass , water or shade . I brought her home behind the car in the trailer , and as I drove ( not being able to see her ) I forgot the bones , the dust , the hanging head , the wart , and fell in love with her . I thought I was bringing home a glossy black mare , smooth and fine-limbed , with lovely spirited head , a fiery , intelligent eye , and good saddlegaits . I gave her a name befitting a Spanish princess . Juanita . My heart beat with pride and excitement when I stopped the car in front of the terrace of the ranch house . They were all there . Michael , some of the boys , Eugenie , and some friends . They said , " What 's that in the trailer ? " They shrieked . Even Michael , who can smell good horseflesh a mile away , was stunned . I turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tired horses often do , with weight on one hind leg so that all her bones ( and you saw them all ) seemed askew and lopsided. 81Her color was rusty black and dun . Her weary head hung dispiritedly over the side of the trailer . Her eyes were half closed . Her wart very conspicuous . Where was my Spanish princess ? I had to laugh myself . We laughed until we ached . It was one of those times when you just ca n't stop . And of course I knew the laugh was not on Juanita , but on me , for they kept shrieking , " Mary ! How could you ? " But in the end , she was Juanita , the Spanish princess . Broken , trained , schooled , well fed , groomed , cherished  --  " You 'll know her from the other mares , " said Michael not long ago as he directed a man to go out and bring her in from pasture , " because she 's the one that looks like a race horse . " She adores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drops the prize foal of the bunch , never like herself but reproducedin the image of the Sire  --  a golden chestnut . And they are as alike as peas in a pod . She raises them beautifully while she is being ridden by all our heavyweights , jumped over hurdles and taken on pack trips . On the Suicide Ride she is way out in front carrying Michael . This is the follow-the-leader run , down steep hills , up and down banks , over streams and hedges , always at a fast gallop , which is the last wild ride of the camp term . Rheingold was one of her children and she would be thrilled to meet him . I could imagine them rearing , nipping at each other , interweaving their heads and necks . But what about Blazes ? How would he receive his well-grown three-year-old son ? Usually , when the young colt is two , his Sire does n't want him around any more and drives him  --  with mean bites  --  out of the band . Well , I thought sulkily , intent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where there is always a good-sized trout under the bank , I do n't need to open the gate , I 'll just roll under the fence . But I knew the result would be practically the same . Blazes and his mares would come rushing down the meadow . Roamer and Rheingold on this side of the fence ; Blazes and his gang on the other ; myself in between , and undoubtedly those bad dogs would begin to bark frantically and even chase the foals. 82At the exact moment I came to this conclusion and decided I might as well give up my fishing trip , my escorting animals knew it . Roamer dropped his nose and began to graze . Rheingold did the same . The dogs removed their attention from me , trotted about , smelling out rabbit trails . I realized it had grown much darker and looked up at the sky . That heavy cloud was overhead , and suddenly lightning split it . I was going to get a wetting , I saw , unless I hurried home . I quickly reeled in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark clouds were boiling up . There was a crash of thunder . Missy leaped from my shoulder and vanished . It began to pour . I tucked down my head to protect my eyes , pressed my can of worms to my bosom and plugged homeward . Streams of water were running down Roamer 's white coat . Rheingold had turned a dark , soaked brown . Stoically , they both lowered their heads and hunched their shoulders . There were sudden , surprising blasts of wind . Bitter cold struck through me , the skies let loose one crash of thunder after the other . Lightning played all around me . I saw the field covered with little bouncing white marbles , which quickly became ping-pong balls , and looking up to see what on earth was happening , I caught a chunk of ice on the cheek bone . I made for shelter  --  that outcrop of rocks there  --  and as I squeezed under the overhang a little cottontail fled out from it . I tasted salt blood from the cut on my cheek . Presently I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glittered with diamonds . All colors were intensified ; green of grass and trees , red of roofs , blue of sky ; and as I looked , a rainbow came into being  --  the perfect arch , spanning the saddleback and the ranch ; and then as I watched ( no one can look away from a rainbow for a single second ) , another rainbow above it , again the complete arch . And then , unbelievably , the third . I stood at the cattle guard  --  staring . " Hilda ! Hilda ! I 'm drenched ! Throw some sacks down on the kitchen floor ! " She was horrified at my bloody face and chattering teeth. 83 " Goodness sakes , Mrs. Bergwin ! " Homemade rolls were baking in the oven and the room was warm . Hilda got my big bath towel and I stood in front of the hot stove and pulled off my dripping things . One of the trout was a beauty  --  twelve inches long . Hilda cleaned them and we had them for supper. 84Chapter 12I suppose it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him his skill in moving large numbers of horses . He needs no one to help him ; in fact , does n't want anyone around . The ranchers hereabouts comment upon it . " He 's right handy with a horse , " they say . They can not do it themselves . They collect neighbors to help and they all yell and gallop and get the horses running like mad . It takes half a dozen cowboys to keep them headed where they are meant to go . Not only Michael 's ways with horses , but our ways with all the animals , in fact our ways in general  --  ranching , planting , cooking , managing , everything is commented upon via the countrygrapevine . This country , which appears so empty , is simply sizzling with gossip and gossipers . We have no close neighbors . Ranch houses are miles apart and have no telephones , but they are linked by communication lines as effective as the African drums . Any telegram we send or receive is read aloud to anyone who comes ; so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is known ; if we have more or fewer boys for our summer camp than we had counted on , whether or not we will clear expenses is thoroughlygone into . Just how many hired hands we employ , what time they start work in the morning , how we feed them . And , if you should happen to drop in at the ranch just at dinner time , could you count on being asked to dinner ? A good dinner ? ( This became a racket. ) 85Greenhorns are always fair game and we did n't mind . Sometimeswe got a laugh ourselves when the tales came back to us . " How d'ye think they planted their potato field ? With Frenchfriedpotatoes ! " " What do you think she said when I went over there one day and told her one of her cows down in the meadow was wantin ' a bull ? She said , How do you know ? ' It got about soon that I knew nothing , not even the facts of life , would believe everything I was told ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I became accustomed , after smiling a greeting at some familiar face in the Cheyenne grocery , or garage , or at the Granite CanyonPost Office , to see several heads pressed together , faces contorted , and to hear the particular kind of sniggering laughter that always means someone is being ribbed . Strange things happened which purported to be accidents . " A bull , you say , Mrs. Bergwin ? A strange bull on your ranch ? Why how could such a thing happen ? Must have been some steer just happened to wander in . " " No , a bull . " " I bet it was a steer . " " No , a big red bull . " " A steer ' ud be just as big and red , but only  --  " " I tell you it was a big Hereford bull  --  I heard him bellowing down in the meadow . " Glancing about , I caught the look on the listening faces , red with pent laughter , and realized it had all been staged . But I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions prodded me if I paused . And I told how I had been sleeping outdoors , my cot under a tent fly that hung over a pole suspended between two pine trees ; and that I was wakened early one morningby the terrible bellowing of this bull . lie was quite far away  --  down in the meadow . And I lay there trying to figure out what bull that could be . Then he stopped roaring and I wondered where he was going . There 's a little path that comes up from the meadow , behind the house , to the stable corrals . My cot was right beside that path , and if he did follow it , he would end up here at my bedside and , maybe , be enraged by the white86tent fly and charge it . There had been silence for some minutes  --  I wondered where he would be right now  --  and suddenly leaped out of bed , swept aside the tent fly and all but hurled myself upon his horns ! My listeners exclaimed , " Tck ! Tck ! Tck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day I do n't understand about that bull , for we have met again and again . One night about midnight I was lying awake , unable to sleep , and heard a group of riders coming in the ranch road . They made no effort to muffle their steps or their voices ; they shouted and joked and galloped past the house , up the gorge and on up to the corrals . I thought perhaps some men wanted a short cut between the highway and the county road and had come through our ranch . No one is supposed to do this and it would have angered Michael . But he did not wake and I soon fell asleep . In the morning we found that same big Hereford bull shut into our corral . Old George , very excited , recognized the bull . A killer who had been put off his owner 's ranch years ago . No one would have anything to do with him or take the responsibility for him . Everyonewas afraid of him . We put him out on the county road . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite alone , wandering up and down . If I was on horseback I would stop and look at him and he would stand quietly and look back at me . With his immense body of beef , his little short legs , and stumpy horns sticking straight out sideways , he bore little resemblance to my Roamer . At last he disappeared . There is one advantage greenhorns have . They get scientific advice from the County Agent and read the government bulletinsthat are freely handed out . Local ranchers seldom do . We had a whole shelf of those bulletins . There was not one piece of information a greenhorn might need that was not given us in a short well-written brochure . Here was the agricultural brains and know-how of the country . So when I was faced with the extraordinary sight of three87immense hog carcasses  --  pink and hairless  --  laid on the grass before me , and heard the hired man say , " All ready for you to can , Missus , " and had recovered from my initial astonishment ( which provided amusement , via @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to the bookcase , extracted the brochure entitled How to Put Up Your Hog , commandeered a couple of hired hands and the use of the bunkhouse kitchen for a couple of days , and put them up ! The article promised superlative results provided directions were followed and this proved true . Never was such richly flavoredsausage meat , never such tasty bacon , never such tempting head cheese , or appetizing jellied feet . And the hams ! Here the brochure outdid itself . It stated that if you want to get your banker on your side for the rest of your life , just give him one of the hams when they have been rubbed with black pepper and sage and neatly sewn into tight jackets of white linen and hung from your kitchen rafters for six months ! And so , likewise , with the potato planting . Right out of the book , that planting ! And the resulting prize crop . I have always thought Michael escaped razzing because of his horsemanship . This , they simply could not laugh off . And in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighbor twenty miles south , came to visit us one day . Visitors came just to look around and see what we were up to , frequently to borrow equipment , or discuss a fence line , or just to cut through from one road to the other . Langley was a big red-headed fellow with a poker face . He was always needing a shave , always chewing . It might have been gum or tobacco but the jaws swung as my cows ' do . When he was ready to leave he rode his horse down on the Green and put on a bucking show . The horse performed every trick the horses do at the rodeos . Langley sat him without difficultyand kept casting challenging glances at Michael and me . Michael scorns the immense western saddle which , he claims , is like a rocking chair into which the rider is practically fastened to keep him from falling off . He scorns the way the westerner mounts  --  his back to the nose of the horse . He scorns the way the88horse is allowed to start off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first thing Michael teaches a horse is to obey the command , Stand ! ) He scorns the constant whooping it up , lashing , spurring the horse to buck and rear and show off . He scorned everything that Langley was doing and did not disguise it ; but of course I was impressed , and this disgusted Michael still more . I smiled in amazement and clapped my hands , and Langley was pleased as punch and rode off with head up , chewing his cud vigorously . Another neighbor , Reuben Haygood , is quite different and has become a friend . He uses horses in the human and humane way we do ourselves and Michael often hires him to come over and help out with our haying . I remember him last year when he was cleaning up Crooked Meadow with a rake team , his Nig and our Baby harnessed together  --  expertlycombing it with the rake , piling the greenyyellowhay into shaggy piles . He stopped the team as I greeted him . " Good morning , Mrs. Bergwin . " " Good morning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I do n't feel so good . How do I look ? " " Why you look fine to me , Rube . " " Yeah . That 's the way . See how I handle this team , Missus ? " " Yes . I was watching you . You handle them as if you know just what you are doing . " " And by talkin ' to ' em . I do n't hit ' em . That Baby of yours now , you notice by pullin ' at her you ca n't get her over , but just by talkin ' you can do it . " He passed on . And I heard him talk to them . " What you doin ' there now , Nig ? Do n't get to fightin ' . Now , Baby , look out , Baby , swing over now , Baby  --  " And obediently the horses would climb into a small stack and over , while Rube expertly lifted the rake and dropped another mound of hay on the pile . Baby was one of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy to ride . Her dull brown coat and coarse black mane gave her an undistinguished appearance but I liked to ride her. 89Michael disapproved . Horse must balance the rider , rider must balance the horse . This was why the Prince of Wales took so many falls  --  he rode horses too large for him . But whether we balanced or not , Baby gave me a thrilling ride , for she was eager to go ; she had smooth gaits ; and she had an affection for me . Under such circumstances I would enjoy riding an elephant. 90Chapter 13Now Michael has distributed all our horses  --  about a hundred  --  into the correct pastures for summer use . He brought the brood mare bunch  --  mares , foals , stallion  --  up from Castle Rock Meadow , moved them through the other meadows , then through the Home Pasture , up through the gorge and Stable Pasture , across the county road , up the saddleback and out onto Section Twenty . There they will spend the summer in charge of the stallion , out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near the house . Blazes will see to it that the mares are always where grass is thick and rich . He will hold them in sheltered draws during storms ; take them to water holes ; repel intruders . Two cowboys , working all the time , could not take as good care of these mares and colts as one good range stallion . Riley and George had orders to be invisible throughout the day . Not one head must be seen . Not one shout be heard . The dogs were locked up . The trek involved the opening and closing of about six gates . I offered to do this but Michael preferred to do it himself . He would ride Gold Coin , our big sorrel gelding . Gold Coin 's gaits are nothing to give a rider pleasure , but he is wise . He could almost do this job himself . The next bunch he brought in were the eighteen two-yearoldsfrom Section Seven . Ten of these were fillies , eight were colts . In the corral , he separated them , drove the fillies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are to be gelded , in the Home Pasture , convenient for the veterinarian when he arrives. 91Then from the main bunch of saddle horses and geldings and work horses he cut out the three three-year-olds who are to be trained immediately for use this summer . Diabolo , Wing Ding and Prinny . They were halter-broken when they were two , but they 've never been ridden . To have them ready for the boys to ride ten days from now means gruelling work . Here in the west horseback riding is no sport . Riders  --  cowboysand bronco busters  --  break horses in order to use them in their work . They do it as quickly as they can ; violently , sometimescruelly , but efficiently . Often the horses are found , rounded up and corraled in one day , broken the next , used under the saddle or in harness the next . The horse is fought to a finish and licked . There is that one thing he has to learn  --  that he must submit to a master . Then he is ready for work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that he will begin the fight already weakened . Then he is lassoed , his feet are tied , when he struggles up he is thrown again . Then he is sacked out . This means that he is flicked and whacked continuously with a blanket or sack ; banged on one side of the head then the other , until he stands without a quiver no matter what happens to him . Horses are extremely intelligent . Their scientific rating places them right at the top . They soon know the signals . In one of these fights , right at the beginning , they find out they ca n't win and so they give in . After that comes good treatment , oats , kindly words and they discover that life can go on as usual . But they never forget that first defeat and know better than to invite another . Cowboys feel that no horse is safe to be ridden unless he has been licked once . There is , however , the occasional horse who will not give in  --  he 'd die first . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ method . " Something goes out of him , " he shouts , " and he 'll never get it back ! " So he allows more time , subdues the horse more slowly , and it usually works . But cowboys do n't trust it . One of them told92me I was riding a horse not yet ready to be mounted by anyone . We are now working with these three broncs every day . Diabolo is wicked and has learned to toss Riley just about every time he gets on him . He does not toss Michael . And I am not allowed to mount him . Wing Ding is the biggest . When full grown he may be sixteen hands . Michael thinks he may do for the army . That would mean a good price . Michael is being very careful with him . The troubleoften is the rough treatment a horse gives himself , banging about , throwing himself down . For if he gets a bad cut or scar , the army will not take him , no matter how well trained he is . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Riley are far too heavy for her back , so she is my job . The Goetschius books have arrived from New York . Michael brought the package back from the post office and handed it to me . " What is it ? " " The Goetschius books ! Music ! Remember  --  I told you about it ? " I grabbed the package , rushed into the house , tore off the paper and sat down in a corner of the sofa . Counterpoint is the most difficult department of the study of harmony because it is so precise and mathematical . I knew that , so decided I ought to begin with it . I opened Elementary Counterpoint . Without pausing to study or do exercises I rushed through the book to get a general idea of the whole and to understand Goetschius ' plan for the student . I discovered that each chapter was a lesson . At the end were exercises to be done and then corrected . When I finished the book and put it down I already knew a good deal about counterpoint . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is , the flat monotonous line of the sea , or the skyscraper line of New York , it fascinates me . If the line were not solid but made up of a succession of little dots , and if there were two of these dotted lines , two different horizons running along together , one over the other , so that93opposite ( or counter ) to each little dot ( or point ) would be another point  --  this perfectly illustrates two-part contrapuntal or horizontal music . Romance enters in with the beautiful word fugue , for the points do seem to fly . They do not begin exactly together . One line starts running across the page of music ( or across the world , or the keyboard ) and a little later the other line takes off after it . Each of these lines , explains Goetschius , must be a beautiful melody in itself , and to achieve this you must be obedient to rules . In addition , when they are joined in a partnership of flying , they must be beautiful as a duet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They have to get married , these two horizon lines ! Not only one beautiful creature plus another beautiful creature , but a beautiful relationship as well ! But what is beauty ? Who can say that there is such a thing ? I can say it . For me , there is . Swift , graceful movement is beautiful . Flight , fuga , is beautiful . One summer one of the boys said to me , " But Mrs. Bergwin , how can you be so sure ? How do you know there is a God ? Supposingthere really is n't ? Or supposing you could n't believe there is ? " " It would n't make any difference to me . " " Why not ? " " I would worship just the same  --  worship goodness , worship beauty . I know that 's true because I see it all around me . Look around . Do n't you know it ? A warm color flooding his cheeks answered me . " But is that really IT ? " " It 's enough , is n't it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let you out of prison . " " Prison ? " " The prison of the flesh  --  of the merely physical , of the mate-rial . " He sat wondering . " But you said worship  --  all this is n't God , is it ? " 94 " Funny you should ask that . St. Augustine asked it about fifteen hundred years ago . He tells about it in his book . " " And what was the answer ? " " He said that just by loving the physical world so much he was asking it if it was God . And its beauty answered , No ! But He made us ! ' " He looked baffled . Since Goetschius undertakes to impart a technique he begins , as all schoolmasters do , with an examination of the classics . Look , for example , at one of Bach 's Two-Part Inventions , which are short fugues . The horizontal lines of notes start at the beginning and fly without pause to the end . Analyze each line and you will see that it comprises two kinds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Positive : fragments of very pronounced character called motifs which are repeated throughout the piece in different keys . Negative : rambling interludes that have not much character or originality but merely serve to connect the motifs . So before you attempt to do two related lines , write just one line of correctly mingled positive and negative music . And beforethat , write one motif ( anywhere from three notes to a couple of measures ) . And before that , make one note move beautifully and obediently to the next ! It is astonishing how many things you are forbidden to do if you are to get from one note to the next in accordance with the rules of strict counterpoint . It seems like a stunt such as children set themselves to do . Tie your hands , blindfold your eyes , put your legs into a sack , and then see if you can make it from here to there . Bach considered his Inventions stunts . He says he wrote them for exercises . Now I have done the exercises at the ends of Chapters 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are to be gelded are out on the Green , drinking at the fountain and playing with each other . I 've just been standing at the door watching them. 95You can almost see the hot sap pouring through them . Their coats , gleaming and iridescent as if they had been oiled , are golden , and black and blood bay . Manes and tails do not just hang  --  they seem to have a separate life , every hair springing out , strong and erect . Mostly the colts are on their hind legs , their forefeet high in the air , flailing at each other in play . Little squeals and grunts come from them . They wo n't be like this when they have been gelded . There is one among them , a black , whom I did not name till he was nearly full grown . Horse breeders are always looking for that one outstanding animal who might found a dynasty . Such a one as the little Morganhorse who has given hundreds of his progeny his own name and fame . ( Occasionally there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This colt has been outsize from birth ; his coat shines like jet ; he has unusual lift and spring in his action . But it is his hair that is phenomenal . His immense tail sweeps the ground ; his mane is full and billowing and blows around as wild and high-held a face as I have ever seen . He is like a wind rushing over the plains . It is my habit to name them from some early , spontaneous observation . As when I said to one youngster , " No shenanigans , please ! " ( Name , Shenanigan  --  Annie for short . ) Or , " Oh , you 're very hifalutin ' this morning , are n't you ? " ( Name , Hifalutin '  --  Falla for short . ) But I could not name that colt . I struggled for something that would suggest greatness , or lordliness , like Eagle , or Bugle , or Chieftain . He came down those hills blaring like a great horn . Finally I named him for that  --  I named him Trombone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting to be gelded . " What would you think , Michael , if we did n't have Trombone gelded ? Suppose Rheingold does n't pan out as stud ? One can never know in advance  --  " He said he 'd think about it . It causes a lot of trouble to have young ungelded colts growing up on a ranch with a lot of fillies96and mares . Sooner or later there 's bound to be a fight between the stallions . Michael saw such a fight in Belgium , during the war . One stallion killed the other . They have exact , precise fighting strokes , which could be named like a boxer 's . Rear  --  reach over  --  hammer stroke on kidneys . Sink , snake head forward , crunch foreleg . Up  --  bring hoof down  --  cleave the skull . I have seen all these strokes delivered ; I have seen a whole complete fight , but performed by the little foals in play . Just shadow-boxing . I 've been on Prinny . Nothing has happened yet , but it 's rather scary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any minute . She keeps her head turned , watching me , and her back is humped a little under the saddle . That 's close to bucking . I spend all day in riding clothes , too tired at night to change . But I continue with the counterpoint . Michael ca n't make it out . He stopped beside the piano . " What is that ? " " Counterpoint . You remember . I told you . The Goetschius books . " Seriously , not trying to be funny , he asked me , " Is it music ? " I burst out laughing . " Honestly I do n't know ! What do you think ? " " It sounds like something figured out with a slide rule . " " And it is ! Bach called these Inventions . But there are whole concerts of it . Big orchestras and virtuosos play it ! " " But do n't you compose any of it ? You know  --  create it ? " " Yes . About six notes at the beginning . The motif . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Michael , now that he has ordered the pump , is no longer disturbed by the windmill . Every time we go up through the gorge to saddle a horse we pass it . Like a languid lady posturing with a fan she stands gracefully ; now and then as if to tantalize us , waving her fan a97little in one direction , then the other . Then she stands motionless , smiling . She pumps no water . " Will we have to pay for it ? " I hazarded , thinking of several hundred dollars . " Certainly not ! " Michael glared . " It 's no use to us , is it ? And I 've ordered the pump . He can take the windmill down again and use it on some other job . It 's new . " " But  --  the labor . Putting it up . Taking it down . Who 'll pay for that ? " " Not I ! " But my heart sank . In the end , I knew , we 'd have to pay for the labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has n't come yet . I feel I am making a little headway with Rachel . I 've discovered she loves raw eggs . These she takes from a little blue bowl that I hold in my hands . Bunny , like most cocker spaniels , is greedy . If we do not watch , he gulps his own dinner , moves towards Rachel 's and gives a low growl . Rachel immediately steps back , Why , certainly , Bunny , if you want it . I was through anyway . And he eats it while she stands watching him , her long featherytail waving gently . So we worry for fear Bunny gets most of her food . And then , too , she is often far from home at feeding time . Or perhaps she is close at hand , but will not appear because she has been called in too peremptory a manner . So a bowl of food is left out for her at all hours . This does not work very well because of Bunny , or because of the cats who also love corn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love it too . But we have discovered that Rachel feeds herself . She insinuatesherself like a little snake between the bars of the calf pens and eats their raw ground oats . She drinks the sour milk that is put out for the chickens . So we have directed Riley to leave a bucket of sour or buttermilk accessible to the dogs at all times. 98Rachel eats what and when she pleases . It is the wild running that keeps her so emaciated . The raw eggs she licks up out of a little blue pottery bowl on the front terrace just after breakfast every morning . I hold the bowl in my hands . She is extremely dainty and gentleabout it ; casts many glances at me as if to say , " Are you sure this is for me ? If there is any reason I should not take it I wo n't give another lick  --  " I smile down at her . Her eye catches the smile and her brush waves a little as she cleans out the bowl . The dogs usually spend the evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At bedtime we go out with them , let them have a little run , wander around a bit ourselves , then call them and put them into the tool house for the night . That , at least , is the program , and Bunny follows it . But it is seldom that Rachel is not off like a shot the moment she realizes that bedtime is approaching . Bunny , then , is shut into the tool house alone . When Rachel returns , perhaps at midnight , when the whole ranch is deep in sleep , that is when she really has fun . Her bark , or rather , barks  --  for they always come in a barrage ( especially in the middle of the night )  --  are sharp and nervous . She sounds like a woman who simply ca n't stand it another minute . No human being could sleep through her barking . She places herself at a high vantage point where she can see every part of the ranch spread out below her in the bright moonlight ; and her rule is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a leaf is swung by the wind , bark at it . If a cloud goes over the moon and all the chiaroscuro is changed , bark at it . If a horse , grazing on the Green , takes a step , bark at it . At the first bark I am sitting up in bed , holding my head in despair . How long before Michael wakes ? Is there any use in going out and trying to stop her ? No , there is n't . She wo n't come if I call . I ca n't catch her . No use . After about half an hour of her barking , Michael is thoroughly awake , angry , determined. 99Michael does not accept defeat as easily as I , so he goes out . There are gentle calls , " Here , Rachel , here , Rachel , come , puppy , that 's a good little girl ! Here 's a biscuit for you , Rachel ! " She thinks this over in silence for a moment , then looses anoutburst of barks . The same soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , Bunny ! " She stops barking , sits there on the hill , watching Michael . He calls again , still softly . The horses hear his voice and movetoward him . Rachel forgets all about Michael and gives thehorses a piece of her mind . Michael shouts . Rachel disappears . He yells at her  --  that commanding yell ; but she does not returnuntil , disgruntled , he has gone back to bed . Then she comes back , sits on the hill , and barks some more . Just caught a glimpse of a familiar apparition on the sky line . Diabolo cantering jauntily along with an empty saddle . Where is Riley ? He trudges in , usually , about an hour after Diabolo has got back. 100Chapter 14I have come to the chapter in Elementary Counterpoint where the student must begin to " manipulate " motifs . The motif is given in the book . The student must work out a correct counterpoint to it ; then a counterpoint for the counterpoint . This constitutes the thematic ( or positive ) material of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Though the motif is short , often only two or three measures , yet there need be no more thematic material in the whole piece , only " negative " music to link the motifs together . I have discovered something interesting about the motif . If it is ugly , the counterpoint to it is uglier , and the counterpoint to the counterpoint still uglier . The whole piece , then , is a masterpieceof ugliness and very painful to work on . But if the motif is beautiful , as in most of Bach 's contrapuntal works , then the counterpoint to the motif is beautiful , and the counterpoint to the counterpoint , and so the whole piece . How strange and wonderful ! These little scraps of music  --  one measure or sometimes even part of a measure  --  how can it be that in them is contained the whole beauty that finally is deployedin a three- or four-page Invention ? But so it is , as ( I explained to myself ) the whole oak is in the acorn , and the whole beauty of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goetschius book are very ugly indeed . And I manipulated them bravely and ended up with one horrible piece of counterpoint after the other . And I suffered . So when I came to the page that directed the student to invent101his own motif and then manipulate it , I was happy . Now I would show them . With confidence and excitement I set myself to invent a beautiful motif . Ah ! How strange ! It 's not so easy after all ! How altogether incomprehensible ! I have not been able to do it ! With all the abundance of my musical imagination and my free-flowing inspirationI have not been able to create one single tiny motif worthy of manipulation ! This is an immense surprise to me , and I remember that Vernon Spencer once said to Michael , " Your wife knows a great deal , but not as much as she thinks she knows . " I work harder . I struggle mightily . I write motif after motif . Let me just create one  --  musical  --  acorn ! But I can not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice is hoarse . I am half blind . It 's a warm cloudless summer day  --  almost the first we 've had . At Michael 's orders Riley and George took the big rug , the curtains and upholstered pieces out of the living room and cleaned them . The whole house is spanking clean . Late in the afternoon Michael came in . I was standing before the fireplace , very morose because of counterpoint motifs . He was jubilant . " Well , I 've had a good day . I got the tank scrubbed out , all the holes in it soldered up , made the new cement platform for it farther up on the hillside so we 'll have more water pressure , set the tank on it , pipes all connected . Now that 's done ! George has made two big batches of butter . I 've got the colts in , looked them over and fed them oats . And the pump ought to arrive in a day or two . " He kissed me . He looked terrible . Unshaven . Ragged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't I a horrible-looking thing to be coming around to kiss a lady ? " " This , " I said , " is to celebrate the plumbing ? Or the plumber ? " Riley has come in with the mail . There was a post card for102Michael to say the pump from Montgomery Ward has come . Now Michael will have to take the trailer over to the station , pay for the pump ( C.O.D. , of course ) , have it loaded on the trailer and bring it home , then install it . But suddenly she 's whirling like a Dervish ! There 's a good wind blowing right there ! The long blades are almost invisible in the air . The piston rod goes up and down , pumping water up into the tank ! The lady is laughing at us , up there in the gorge . She 's havingfun , whirling her fan . We 're having fun too , watching her . " What about the pump from Montgomery Ward , Michael ? " " It can go back , " says Michael @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charges ? " " Not I ! " ( But we will . ) " I 'm going to town . " " By the time you get back there 'll be water in the house and a hot bath for you . " Michael is usually overjoyed to see me when I have been away , but this time , when I returned , I found him distraught . " I 'm in the doghouse again . " " About the water system ? " I asked in alarm . He nodded . " What 's the matter now ? " " It runs down into the basement but not up into the kitchen or the upstairs . Ca n't understand it . Runs into the bunkhouse too , and that 's higher than our upper story . " He explained a little more , then in exasperation flung the subject away . He built a fire and lit it . " Let 's not talk about it or think about it . I do n't give a damn . I 'm going to take a long day of rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In my mental vision I saw the network of pipes underground and tried to figure out the different levels , the pull of gravity . " How strange , " I said thoughtfully . " I said we would n't talk about it , " he snapped ; and I turned103away , put on the radio , sat down on the couch , feeling rebuffed . There was a long silence . The fire sparked a little . I could n't think of a thing to say . His eyes drifted to me across the room and he asked softly , " Tired , honey ? " " Going to town always makes me tired . " " I 'm tired too . Dog tired . I 'm going to have a drink . " He went to the kitchen and came back with two glasses , handed me one and sat down . We sipped our highballs while the fire slowly burned down . Then he said , " Before I go to bed , I 'm going up to see if the tank is overflowing . The mill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want it to undermine the dirt foundation . " Soon he came back . " Well , I 've found the trouble . The tank is empty . The water has all run out . And down here in front of the house , where the pipe turns to go into the basement , the ground is soaking . That 's where there 's a big leak . Either in the joint , or the pipe has burst . " " Oh , that 's fine , " I cried . " Is n't it ? Now you know where the trouble is and you 're out of the doghouse ! " " No , it 's not fine , " he said violently . " It 's a pain in the neck . " I was silent , trying to figure it out . " Do you think the pipe froze ? " He nodded . " How deep was it ? " " Three feet . " The way he looked at me , I knew he felt guilty . He 's been told that , to be safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's put them one foot , two , three , as it were , fighting every inch of the way . They 've all frozen and burst . He and Riley have dug up the pipe , found the leak and put in a new length of pipe . Water came into the faucets all over the house , upstairs and down , Eureka ! " Then you 're out of the doghouse ! " I said joyously . " No , I 'm still in the doghouse . " " What now ? " " My hot water boiler in the cellar has burst . " 104There is a man called Williams who goes around buying horses from ranchers . Michael hates to sell to him because he offers so little ; but often we have to . He came yesterday morning when Michael had driven down to Castle Rock Meadow to inspect the dam . I told Williams I 'd go down and get Michael , but he said he 'd come back tomorrow . I walked down to the meadow myself to tell Michael the good news , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the car and gone up the range somewhere . I walked up the slopes of the saddleback , wondering if he was watching me from somewhere . He has hawk 's eyes . If he was , why did n't he come to meet me ? Probably a little more inspection of the fences , the water hole , the grass , or what-not . I reached a high point and looked around . Then I saw the car circling far off , winding in and out the gullies and ravines . It takes expert driving to drive the range . It looks like an almost level expanse , but it is really a succession of undulations melting into each other , some shallow , some deep , some concealing little springs , runs , rills , groves of trees , fields of green grass , even a house or small building . As I looked , the car disappeared . I stood waiting , determined to stay right there until he found me . I tilted my head back and was lost in the vast blue sky . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I looked slowly all around . When one stands quietly out there on the range , one is watched by many eyes . Listening , you can hear the voices  --  the little pipe , the chirp , the far whistle , the cry , the sudden rustle nearby . My eye caught a little movement  --  I looked closer  --  two antelopenot fifty yards away . I would not have seen them but for the flash of white under their tails  --  a heart-shaped plastron . They stopped and turned to look at me , then moved away again . They have a strange sliding gait , as if they were rolling on wheels . They are most exquisite little creatures and look like porcelain figurines , quite unreal . Suddenly the car slid out of the ground right there to my left , 105and came toward me as if to run me down , with Michael 's big grin over the wheel . I jumped in and as we drove home told him about Williams coming and that he was on a horse-buying tour . " Is n't that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just when I 've moved them all out to the farthest section . " All the same , when we got home , he put on breeches and boots , rode out over the saddleback , cut out twenty horses , brought them in and left them in the corral . Williams never came back . Michael moved the horses out again . The veterinarian came and gelded the young stallions . There was one casualty . Sometimes , for no special reason , one takes a fancy to a particularcolt . Perhaps , with Star , it was because I had so often felt him give me a little nudge in the back if I was in the corral with all the colts milling about me . When I am making friends with a horse I turn my back so that , freed of my eye , he can come up behind and get to know me by smelling me . And first he touches his muzzle lightly to my shoulder blades , sniffs , blows on my nape , then gives a few snorts and prances away , only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the small of my back which means he likes me and wants to be friends . But it is more than that . He wants the excitement of my eye on him . When a horse first feels the human eye , it is almost unendurableto him . He goes half crazy . But what he at first fears he comes to tolerate and finally long for . I would turn and look at him , wondering which one was makingadvances to me ; then see the bright white star on his forehead , and recognize his comic , inquiring face . Something about him always made me laugh . Here on the ranch we see death often and close . When an old horse or cow takes the last step and sinks down , one does not grieve . It is good and right to sleep at the end of a long day . But106when it is a little filly like Floss , or a boy like Star , it flings a heavy pall . I stood outside the corral looking at the rest of them . Hanging heads and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six . Michael , I saw , had gone down to the house to get the car . To drag a dead animal through the pastures and across the range and up the hill to the shaft of the old gold mine in Section Sixteenis a job that he hates , but no one else can do it . The car backed up to the corral gates . I ran to the window . " Trombone ? " I asked . " I put him out on the range , " Michael answered . His scowl did not lessen . He probably felt he was shirking a duty . So he 's out there still . Still sailing over the hills with his head way up , a wild question in his eyes , and all that hair ballooning around him . I have acquired a second maid . An attractive Japanese girl whose name is Fumiko. 107Chapter 15Michael and I have spent a day in the car driving across the state to retrieve three saddles he lent a man last fall . A hundred and fifty miles to get there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take the time but we need the saddles for the boys . Mostly , we short-cut across the plains on old dirt roads . The whole day was like a dream in which we traveled strenuouslyand got nowhere . Grass and sky . Clouds and shadows . They held our eyes . They made the dream . They made us silent and spellbound . Strange , that all over the world the American west is typified by guns and bandits , holdups , rough riding , when the truth of it is this wide rolling emptiness , this incredible beauty . The horizon line was never without a little cluster of dark lines , a windmill and huddle of buildings all off the square . When one faded into the distance there would be another cominginto view . Sometimes there were several . Those old windmills are made of wood . They sit on squat wooden towers and look like sturdy athletes , twirling Indian clubs . But modern ones are like ours  --  made of fine strands of white metal , as delicate as spider webs against the sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the landscape hardly changed . Here was the same view that had welcomed me on the fourth day of the long bus trip from New York . I had watched one state after the other pass the window . When we began to be lifted up into the high altitude , into that down-curving dark blue sky , I was hypnotized again as I always am after I have been away . And remembering the way it feels to have a horse under108me on those plains , cantering on that cushiony grass , I began to be excited , I felt the rhythm , clop , clop , and presently I was composing a song . I named it Green Grass of Wyoming and decided that it could be the theme song of my Musical . Mr. Fox would publish it , I felt sure . The Musical exists at present in a box filled with different folders that contain songs , dances , theme books filled with melodies and musical ideas to be developed later . The box is labeled in good-sized black letters , FOR THEMUSICAL . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Schirmer returned a song I had submitted to them , saying , . . this is musical and has charm . . . the composer should study composition . " Yes  --  for half a lifetime I have had this dream . Is it a dream ? Or an intention ? Is there a difference ? When my sister Elma , aged thirteen , declared she was going to be a Medical Missionary and spend her life doing good in foreign lands , probably working among the women confined in the zenanas of India , she was not taken seriously ; and yet , one by one , she took those steps that finally made her head of a hospital in Shanghai , that put her in a pulpit to preach sermons in Chinese and a classroom in which she taught modern obstetrics to young Chinamen . And when , aged fifteen , I said , " Someday I 'll write a Musical , " neither was I taken seriously , even by myself , and yet have never ceased taking steps to fulfill that dream . The compositions have steadily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few of the dances to publishersand was told that if I could get a well-known choreographer , a man , say , like the famous Russian , Chalif , to make choreographies for them , they could be published . It is not easy to get a prominent artist 's attention , to make him really listen , to overcome that habitual listlessness and lack of expectancy which inevitably comes to be the chronic attitude of everyone who achieves eminence . I saw Chalif and told him the proposition . He put me off from109day to day . He had a class . Or the pianist was not there . " Where is Nelson ? Do you know where Nelson is ? " He got everyone in his large suite of rooms in Radio City hunting for Nelson . " Can you not play them yourself ? " I shook my head sadly , knowing how easily all my skill desertsme at a crucial point . At last one day , when again Nelson had vanished I undertook to play them on that frightful piano  --  many keys missing  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and outdid myself . " You play very well , " said Chalif . " I do not know why you are so modest . " Then he made a gesture , and said , " Your music has this . " He clenched his fist before his face , stiffened his whole body , thrust up his fist an inch or two and gave a little stamp . Oh ! that stamp ! My eyes suddenly burned . I could not conceal my emotion , my excitement , or restrain my smiles and tears . And he beamed at me understandingly and it was as if he took me in his arms and patted me and said , There  --  thereHe then carefully went over each dance with me , explaining with an artist 's patience and precision just what each one was . " This Ski Waltz is an exhibition waltz . Just two people on the stage dancing together , dressed in formal evening dress . This Dancing Dolls ( which I like very much ) is a whole ballet  --  about six minutes and a half  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he explained , I saw each dance  --  all performed so beautifullyon the stage of my Musical . I wondered why I had not seen all this myself , from the start . No deal resulted , of course . The choreographies would have cost too much money ; but I went out walking on air . Oh , that clenched fist ! Oh , that stamp ! The dances and Chalif 's directions as to what to do with them are all there in the box , and now the theme song too . On this long , all-day grass-drenched ride with Michael , I began to think about the story . Story ideas  --  the best of them  --  come to me when I 'm not try-110ing ; when my immediate attention is directed elsewhere , as , now , I was watching the horizon and the moving , changing shapes of the cloud shadows . Ideas come , then , from that lower level of the mind where the subconscious moves freely , whimsically and erratically ; and the conscious mind watches and takes note of them with surprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's drifting up ! " Henry James said it was like watching a pot boil . You lean over the stove watching the stew : " Ah ! there 's an onion ! A carrot ! A chum of meat ! " A story for my Musical boiled up . Half a dozen stories boiled up . It would be laid in Wyoming , of course , a sort of folk tale . And long ago , when we were raising sheep and there was a herder in charge of them , I had been surprised at his face , a distinguished , aquiline face . And I had made inquiries , and had been told tales that you could believe or not , as you chose , but immediately I put the tales into the mouth of a character in the play , and it went like this : " Wyoming sheepherders ? They bin written up in the newspapers ! Big bugs  --  that 's what they were once ! Seen better days ! Most of ' em come f'um the east . Git into trouble , hightail it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cai n't say as I blame ' em . Eff'n you got to run f'um the law , run as fur as ye kin ! " And so I would have three of these , and they would be funny men . And there would be one more  --  the hero , who had come west not because of a disgrace but because he was hunting a lost grandson . Suddenly I had my story in a capsule . Story of a lost boy . And he would be the young hero , who could n't marry the girl he loved because he was a " catch colt "  --  Ah ! Here 's the title  --  The Catch Colt  --  and it 's absolutely true of this boy , because no more than the catch colts on the range who are caught and tamed because they are handsome and have points although no pedigrees , does he have any background or knowledge of his people . And then I would have to get grandfather and grandson together ! And I 'd have to have a chorus , and remembered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famous Coloradoherd had told me he never allowed a milking machine or a male milker in the barn  --  just women or girls . So then I saw half a dozen pretty milkmaids . And the ranch would be a dairy ranchSometimes the ideas boil up so fast it exhausts me . I hurry to a typewriter and jot down an outline , a sketch , a bit of dialogue , the description of a face or type . All this would go into The Box as soon as I got home . Michael did not succeed in getting the saddles . The man had sold them . He and Michael got in a fight . Michael 's fist is still sore . All the way home his face had that look and I grieved . So today he took the long day in town he has been promising himself . And I spent the time at my desk making an ink copy of Joy in the Morning to send to Mr. Spencer . I resent having to do this , but he demands it . It is the Leipzig idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible . It tires my fingers and stiffens my neck and gives me a cramp in my foot . Besides , it makes it too final . So far , I think I have never played this piece twice the same . Still experimenting . Does it sound better in this register ? Or this ? Better with the melody in single notes ? Or octaves ? It is only a couple of months old . Many of Chopin 's works evolved for ten years . Brahms 's for ten . Beethoven 's never less than one . As for the counterpoint , I cut the Gordian knot . Since I am unable to compose a motif worthy of being developed I did as so many composers do  --  stole one . It is all right to do this , I have discovered , provided only that you announce it in advance . The title of my piece of counterpoint is Two-Part Invention in G Minor . And above the first staff I have put a bit of a miniature staff and the words , From a Bach Bourree  --  and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that constitute my motif . D , G , D , E flat . From there I have no difficulty in continuing . I know that I have a worthy musical acorn , and that in due time ( and considerablework ) I will have the oak. 112ob . I took a walk after supper . A beautiful balmy evening . Then put the dogs to bed in the tool house , then went indoors . The livingroom was dark . I sat down in the pompous chair and turned the radio on and sat listening awhile  --  but just nonsense . Turned it off . Sat there a long time in the empty room , the dark , the silence . I could see the French windows opening out onto the terrace ; the square panes of glass , so soft and pretty , were faintly light  --  was that starlight already ? I went out again and wandered around . There is a night light that I do not understand . Not moonlight or starlight , but the whole sky luminous  --  a pale burning blue over an earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black gulf lookingup . What was that fire ? The mysterious light faded when the stars came out , one by one , and the earth emerged from its blackness and I saw the familiarshapes of hills and woods and plains . They crowded the sky , those stars , shouldering each other , pouring down lightAfter a while I went in again , lit the lamps . Now it 's nearly midnight . I feel wide awake . I do n't want to go to bed and try to sleep and nap a little and wake up with a jerk to look at my watch and wonder what the time is . " And now  --  " said Michael , after telling me about how first of all he just went to a cafe and sat without moving for a couple of hours with a cup of coffee before him ( he often does this when he gets away from the ranch ) and then went hunting around and found some pretty good army saddles at a secondhandshop , and then did the rest of the errands ( there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Post and Lieutenant Hotchkiss was there and they went to the Club and met some other officers and had drinks and went down to the Plains Hotel for dinner " And now what did you do ? Did you ride ? What did you have for dinner ? " " I had Hilda make a creamed macaroni . " " Creamed macaroni . . . " Michael repeated dully . " And a chocolate cake for you . " He did n't answer . His eyes went to the fire . He looked sunk. 113 " No , I did n't ride , " I said , " I went for a long walk and took a book along . The dogs were out hunting across the creek so I was alone . And I stretched out there on the saddleback and just watched the sky for the longest while . There was a hawk up there . He was patrolling a big section . He saw me . He would slide down and circle away and up again and give that faraway lonely cry  --  " I glanced at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went on : " Then I fell asleep and when I woke up I propped myselfon one elbow and began to read . Then I heard Yip , yip , yip , ' and I looked down the hill and there was Rachel coming a mile a minute , Bunny behind her . So then I came home with the dogs . . . . What about bed ? It 's long after midnight . " He roused himself and said , " Yes ! " with sudden violence . I took my book and we went about blowing out the lamps. 114Chapter 16Reese has written that he is sending Jerome out a little before the camp term opens . Jerome is really our number one boy , not only because he comes nearly every summer but because when my own children are not here he is the son of the house , being my brother 's secondwife 's son . He calls us Aunt Marie and Uncle Michael . When Reese and Eloise got married Jerome was eleven , and it had long been the desire of his mother 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has always been phenomenal , the kind of child who is recognized as a genius in kindergarten . Give him paints and brushes and he immediately paints pictures people want to hang on their walls . A year 's piano lessons and he plays like a professional . Having learned chess , he beat all comers . But he had never welcomed opportunities to become better acquainted with horses . " What about Mary 's ranch ? " said Reese ( very anxious to take Eloise to England for a long honeymoon ) . " There in Wyoming everybody rides . It 's the way they get around . And she and Michael always have boys visiting in the summer . " It seemed made to order . He 's a handsome boy with dark skin , dark eyes , dark mops of hair  --  a streak of Jewish in his ancestry and another of Mongol . I remember Reese leaning over his wife 's chair one evening in the drawing room of his New York apartment . She was in a lovely evening dress of rose-colored chiffon . From above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her high cheek bones . " See that ? " he said proudly , " Mongol . " A faint smile appeared in her narrow and mysterious eyes . We had just come out from dinner . During the meal , Eloise's115Siamese cat had reposed , motionless , in the center of the table . When we rose from our chairs Eloise picked up the cat and draped it over her shoulders , like a fur piece . Mongol made me think of Genghis Khan , and I saw a vision of the mad chieftain and his hordes galloping all over Asia and Russia . But here sat Eloise in conventional evening dress , serene , faintly smiling and complete mistress of New York social amenities . Still  --  there was the cat on her shoulders . Her Siamese cat . When Jerome arrived and I looked at him , shadows of inscrutableSiamese cats flitted across my mind ; and galloping hordes ; cruel arms upraised , cruel knives flashing down . But what I actually saw was an overgrown child wrapped in a sort of sulky protest , already defending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something gentle and appealing reaching out . He aspired . This was the innermost truth of him . I asked him how he managed always to have such high marks at school and he told me , " I could n't bear not to . The minute the master gives out an assignment , then I ca n't do anything or even think about anything until I 've done it . " We soon became aware of his unusual abilities . He soaked up knowledge about everything , and his mind roved , seeking more . He painted pictures . He played the piano . And at the evening games of chess and checkers he was champion . He was passionate , noisy and violent . He had a distinctive laugh , a soft chuckle sustained quite a while all on one pitch . I loved to hear it and kept listening for it . Michael gave him old Baldy to ride . Baldy would know all about Jerome when he had carried him for five minutes . Baldy would do , at all times , whatever he himself thought was right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jerome wore habitually a small red felt cap , like a skull cap . I used to wonder why it never blew off , but it clung to the hair , and the hair clung to it . My counterpoint has gone well . The little musical acorn contributedby Bach did all for me that I thought it would. 116I applied the slide rule . I manipulated , shifted the key of the motif , mingled together proper amounts of positive and negativemusic , invented the counterpoint of the motif according to strict rules out of the book , and then the counterpoint of the counterpoint , and finally drew the two heavy vertical lines that announce , " It is finished ! " All without any emotion at all . Can anything truly alive be born without pain ? When I am doing one of my tone poems or even one of the little teaching pieces it is wrung out of anguish ; ecstasy too . And sometimes I clap my hands over my face and burst into tears . In the writings of the Saints I have seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There is none of this in counterpoint . No movement , no soul . I do n't see how there could be . But it is precise , it is correct , it marches terrifically . Done by a master , it is magnificent . Mathematics versus soul . It would be interesting to pursue this idea further . Does it mean physical versus metaphysical ? And do they , somewhere in infinity , merge and become one ? I think so . I wonder what Vernon Spencer , who , after all is professor of Counterpoint and Fugue at the University of California , would think of my Two-Part Invention in G Minor ? It occurs to me that , without waiting to finish the ink copy of Joy in the Morning , I will send him this little bit of a machinemadething and give him a surprise . The Roamer 's gone again . The fence between our land and Haygood 's is broken through . Riley , Michael and I got on our three broncs and went huntingfor him . This kind of riding is good for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , in and out of streams , slithering down banks and cliffs , clambering up  --  after all , this is what they have been used to since they were born . They relaxed and seemed to know what we wanted . Even Diabolo behaved , and Riley 's comical face wore proud grins . Wing Ding is superb . Well , of course  --  look who 's riding him . " What boy will have Wing Ding ? " I asked Michael . " Some kid my height  --  my weight . " 117I thought them over . Evidently Michael did too , for presentlyour eyes met and an impish grin spread over his face . " Jerome  --  " I said , and felt some consternation . The Roamer was traveling fast . He had gone up over the saddleback toward Langley 's ranch , which seems to have a speciallure for him . Is it some particular cow ? Or just any cow in heat ? We saw him at last far off . There 's nothing else on the range as white as he is . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the horses , and use of Michael 's whip to turn him . Once that was done , he seemed to know the jig was up and trotted briskly homeward . Finally broke into a lope and we made the rest of the trip at an easy canter . When we rode through the Calf Pasture , the cows had come in for milking and were waiting there . When the Roamer reached the corral he began to moan , then to bellow , then put his head down and pawed the ground . Michael made Riley get off and open the gate onto the Green . They made the Roamer go up near the tool house . They put the long chain on him again , and now he 's in the same old place in the meadow by the stream , not moving or eating . A wonderful day today . And all 's well with the water system . The wind blows . The windmill spins . The tank fills . Water runs through all the pipes and out of all the faucets in the house and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is installed . Tubs fill with hot water . The pump has gone back to Montgomery Ward . Invention in G Minor has gone to Vernon Spencer . Wing Ding , Diabolo and Prinny are ready to ride . And in no time at all , this morning , I composed another invention  --  motif and all ! It happened like this . I was waiting for Michael to come down to breakfast . I sat down at the piano and played Invention in G Minor through like a piece , up to time , trying to make it sound as stunning as I could ( and it 's quite stunning ) . Then I began to118fool around , looking for another motif . Instantly I had one . I am astounded by this . How can I have learned how to compose good motifs just by working out one Invention ? But there it is  --  a good , two-measure motif , plus its counterpoint , plus the counterpointof its counterpoint . This one will be Invention in D Minor . I began to manipulate it immediately . Negative material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole thing through , in correct form , to the end . I shall not have to steal motifs any more . There is not much satisfaction in these things . They leave me empty and lonesome . I keep playing Joy in the Morning over and over as if this were my last chance . Everyone likes it . Heads are poked into the room , people stop to listen and say , " What was that little rippling thing you were playing ? Seems to me I have heard it before . " Vernon Spencer once told me that when one writes something that hits the popular taste , it always seems familiar . The ink copy is not nearly finished yet . A piece with a gay ripple that goes on for pages and pages means hundreds of notes . After breakfast I worked some more . I went to the door for a moment 's rest and a breath of air , and looking down , to my surprise , saw Rachel on the door mat . And she had come of her own volition , for Bunny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Had she been hunting among the rocks on the top of the cliff , whimpering with her irrepressible eagerness , nosing , scratching  --  and then the wind brought her the sound of the piano ? And was she , too , seduced by the sweet sound of Joy in the Morning ? As I looked down at her and met the happy look in her upturnedface , I was encouraged . I said , " Would you like to come in , my sweet ? " Yes , please . I let her in and went back to the piano . She moved restlessly about the room for a few moments , collectingolefactory bulletins of Bunny , herself , the cats , Michael and me . Finally she flopped on the rug under the piano , stretched out and was in complete repose . A beautiful white china dog. 119Chapter 17Jerome has arrived . Michael presented him with Wing Ding . " Let 's see you try him out . " Jerome vaulted onto the horse without using the stirrup . He arranged the reins , his knees dug in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flanks and the horse started forward . Leaningin the saddle , to swing his mount in a circle , he looked back at us over his shoulder and Michael walked carelessly away . " He 's all yours . " I wondered about fear . How completely can it be eradicated ? That first summer , before Jerome came to the ranch , Eloise wrote me to tell me about certain of his difficulties . He did n't get along too well with other boys . He would n't go out for athletics . He went his own way and there was something sulky about him . We discovered this ourselves . He would start out on an expeditionwith the other boys , but soon turn back and come homealwayswith an excuse . He had got a barbed wire scratch getting through the fence and knew he ought to put mercurochrome on it right away . A thorn in his finger , a cut , tear , bruise , and he was filled with consternation . He habitually wore patches of adhesiveand bandage  --  dots of medicinal color . At first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had thought nothing of falls , even broken bones . Then I noticed that the teasing of the boys was really jeeringandI heard Riley say , " Why that kid 's afraid of his own shadow . " One day , out painting , carrying paintbox and glass cup of120Twater , he slipped and fell . The cup was broken and Jerome 's hand quite badly cut . It bled freely and he came rushing home , unashamedly howling . While I washed , stanched , assuaged and bound up I was silent , waiting for the uproar to cease . But it did not cease and he continued to seem on the point of fainting . " But Jerome , what is the matter ? It 's not really hurting now , is it ? " " Well  --  no , " he groaned . " And I assure you there 's nothing in the least dangerous about it . " Sobs that seemed to tear his breast . " Is it the blood ? " " Well  --  I  --  do n't  --  know  --  " The immediate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear to think of a child in a chronic state of fear . Under Michael'scommanding eye Jerome had to groom and saddle Baldy , mount him and ride him out of the corral , bring him back after the ride , unsaddle him and lead him to pasture . He had to listen to wild talk of the other boys about the rides they would be having before the summer ended . He would have to listen to evening gab fests when the boys would persuade Michael to reminisceabout the war . Some fear is necessary . We could not live without it . No one wants a child around who has n't sense enough to be afraid ; but courage is necessary too . After all , we live in a world that can wipe us out as easily as we draw a breath . This fact we have to face , get used to , then dismiss . I began to talk about it with Jerome . We took our afternoon rides together . I let him set the pace . ( We ambled . ) We talked about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it and letting it make you suffer , because no matter how carefullyyou guarded yourself , something would happen you could n't foresee and you were finished anyway . And we each contributed a number of such macabre instances . To come out with these did not frighten him but seemed to relieve him . And we had instances of courage too , and we talked of the beauty of it . Nobility . Heroism . And he kindled to this , the color121came up into his face . I told him how the Indians valued courage ; and how the young braves must prove their bravery by climbing to the eagle 's eyrie on top of the cliff and bringing down an eagle 's feather as trophy . " And I 've got an eagle 's feather , Jerome . Not that I climbed a cliff to get it , but it 's a true eagle 's feather . And I 'll give it to you . It 'll help you to remember about this . " He sat up there on Baldy , and turned his face to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I felt clouds of pain rolling away . He said , " If Mother could see me now  --  riding along like this  --  would n't she be pleased ? " And we broke into a gentle trot . I fastened the eagle 's feather in his red felt cap in such a way that it could be turned straight up  --  very jaunty and victorious  --  or tilted despondently down . It could even be worn at half mast . " Now you grade yourself , " I said . " I 'll always be looking for the eagle 's feather . When you ride in with the other boys I 'll see if it 's up or down  --  and I 'll know how you 're getting on  --  " and I thought to myself , self-examination , and self-knowledge and confession  --  the wig-wagging of this eagle 's feather will tell it all . I saw many a trailing feather that summer , with sheepish , hangdog looks from Jerome ; and I saw the feather up , too , with a look of victory . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burn to see it . Eloise was , indeed , very pleased when she heard of Jerome 's riding . And more than pleased when next winter the headmaster at his school told her that the summer on the Wyoming ranch had " put Jerome over . " I wanted to know in what way it had put him over . All I could elicit was that he had " taken hold . " He had been elected president of his class . He had gone out for football and had been made the captain of the team . Jerome , fifteen now and as big as Michael , is still more child than youth , unless conversation becomes intellectual or touches on art . Then his look changes . A depth opens in his eyes . His thoughts are worth knowing. 122Michael has put a ping-pong table on the Green way over beyond the fountain . Michael is quite a champ at it and proud of himself . He 's out there now , playing with Jerome . Jerome , as it happens , has never played ping-pong before , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived  --  seven new boys , and seven old . Young voices shouting and chattering everywhere , doors banging , groups wandering around , trying to get acquainted with each other , with Michael and me , with the lay of the land . The old boys guide them around , explain , warn , tease . They take easily to me . I am just another Mamma . But they do n't know what to make of Michael . Hearing the old boys call him " the General " they catch on to that . Then , hearing that there is an " officer of the day " appointed every morning , to inspect " quarters " and be Michael 's " aide , " they realize the camp is run on military lines . Then they discover that a large part of their lives is arranged for them ; that in the morningsthey do some sort of worthwhile ranch work  --  repairing roads , mending or setting fences , cutting posts ; that after our midday dinner there is an hour of compulsory quiet , reading , writing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compulsory horseback training , nothing less than true West Point " monkey drill " ; and only after that are they allowed to take their horses and go off and do as they please . This adds up to a great deal of conforming and obeying . Now and then we have a boy who seems never to have obeyed anyone before . I always wait to see how long it will be before they begin , in a natural and unconscious manner , to gravitate toward Michael . What is it ? There 's such an up about him . It is hero worship , I think , and I 've always considered it one of the most important experiences of adolescence . If a young person misses it , what a loss ! Like , later on , missing being in love . If Michael is in town for a few hours , the boys just sit around in a slump , waiting for him to get back . One after the other comes to me . " Mrs. Bergwin , when will the General be back ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming back for supper , is there ? " Michael makes all the noise . That this is a virtue and something to brag about I had not realized until one summer when I had come from New York to Wyoming by bus . Three young girls kept the passengers awake with a running fire of talk and laughter all of one interminablenight ; and when the bus stopped at dawn , and they jumped out and were met by friends , they boasted loudly , " We made all the noise , all the way from Omaha ! " There really has to be someone to make the noise ! We have a daredevil , Harry Brimmer , a smallish boy of fifteen with a crew cut , a sudden rough loud voice , very thick eyeglassesand a constant , delightful , Puckish smile . He fell off Diabolo before they had got out of the corral . Mounted him again , was spilled again . By that time Harry was really intrigued . I think he 's going to provide a lot of the fun this summer . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largest horse , disregarding all rules of balance . This is Baldy , who put one ear back as the little fellow was lifted to his back , and thereafter knew he was on his honor . So far , Jerome has had no trouble with Wing Ding , but I wonder how he really feels ? There is no eagle 's feather to tell me . My own preoccupation , these first days of camp , is the food . I am the caterer , shopper , hostess , housemother , trained nurse and confidante . Every other morning I sit with Hilda for an hour at the red checked table in the kitchen and make out the menus for two days . " What will we have for supper , Mrs. Bergwin ? " " What will we have for dessert ? " These two questions have often stumped me , not dinners . Beef , lamb , veal , chicken , pork , ham , game and the vegetables of the season and then around the circle again . But desserts and supper dishes ! The only ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the day before , and the day before that. 124I look pleadingly at Hilda and am secretly outraged by her expression of untroubled expectancy . But now I have solved this problem . Last winter I gave my- self with all seriousness to research in the matter of desserts and supper dishes . Confining myself to recipes that could be made without using all the utensils in the kitchen ( and this rules out magazine reci- pes ) I collected twenty-eight . As our camp term is eight weeks , there need be only one re- peat . So now when Hilda asks me those disturbing questions , I turn the pages of my kitchen book and feast my eyes on the type- written lists . Dutch Apple Pie , Caramel Rice Pudding , Apple- sauce Cake  --  and if Hilda has forgotten how to make them , on the following pages are the simple directions . I type the menus and pin them on the kitchen wall . From the menus I make my shopping lists . I go into Cheyenne three times a week with the trailer hitched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or beets . Michael and I now live in different worlds and it is lonely . He seems quite in his element . I think he is back in the war again and these are his " boys " to think for and care for . But me  --  I feel let loose in a crowd of leprechauns who dance and prance around me , laugh incessantly , shout meaninglessly , talk in a lan- guage unknown to me ( it can not be English ) . At meals , if Michael and I speak to each other , it is a public announcement down the length of a twelve-foot table , he at one end , I at the other . The boys sit on each side . There is a smiling face down there at Michael 's right who really has the look of a cherub . His forehead is framed by flat clustering curls of light brown hair . His eyes are dark blue . He makes me think of a woman who lives in Vernon Spencer 's house who has the beautiful name of Ruth . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her teeth are large , flat , per- fectly even and dazzlingly white . Of course she is the wife of Spencer and this is their boy , Jimmie . Jimmie is all lightness and easiness , all calm content . His smile is his mother 's smile . He is no musician . He is fascinated125by trains , tracks , engineers , railroad systems . He would rather , he tells me , be a brakeman than Paderewski . I wonder what Sheer Genius will do with this ? He sits a horse , says Michael , like a sack of meal . This is the highest praise , for if the rider is relaxed , so is the horse . Prinny took to him immediately . Jerome said , " Aunt Marie , can I have the piano every day in the quiet hour after dinner to practice the way I did last year ? " " As far as I 'm concerned , Jerome , you may . But ask the Gen- eral . " " May I , Uncle Michael ? " Michael gave permission . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why are you so thin ? Did you have many bad colds last winter ? " " I 'm always thin , Mrs. Bergwin . I eat like a horse , too . " " Have you an overactive thyroid ? " " I 've had a metabolism test and I 'm all right . And I have n't got a tape worm either . Dad and Mother have given up worrying about my being thin . " " I think you ought to put on weight . Everyone gains here at the ranch . " Perhaps the rich milk will do it . There are always buckets of creamy milk standing in the cold running water in the spring house , ready for the boys when they come in , hot and thirsty , from riding , late in the afternoons . They dismount , tie their horses and gather in the dark coolness inside . From the terrace I can hear their voices  --  arguing , laughing , gossipingI once said to Elma , who , after all , is a doctor , " I think the boys drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A quart , you mean . " ( She is used to prescribing a quart a day . ) " No , a gallon . They drink three or four glasses at every meal . And three or four dippers from the bucket in the spring house . " Missy presented herself to me as I sat at the window reading , and announced that she was going to have kittens . This was no surprise to me . She made petition to have her confinement in the house , pref-126erably on my lap . I put her out and closed doors . She made the rounds of everyone on the terrace , purring , winding herself around legs , telling about the wonderful thing that was about to happen , then vanished into the darkness . Now she has reappeared , slim as a movie star . She is detached , demure . The boys tease her to show them where the kittens are , but she sits quiet , washing herself , What do youmean kittens ? I know of no kittens . . . 127Chapter 18I have these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ; out onto the terrace ; or it sits on my lap during a long evening in the living room or out driving . Michael has spoken of building a little table for it in the car , beside the glove compartment , so that when we take our long motor trips across the continent , I can just reach forward and pull it out . The big L C Smith is on a permanent table in my bedroom . Sometimes they are both up there , at right angles to each other , a sheet of paper in each  --  writing a story on one , this diary on the other . I have noticed that whenever I tell people little anecdotes about the ranch life here , particularly the horses , they listen with interest . So I think I 'll try that next . Just a short story  --  about five thousand words  --  about one of my horses , perhaps a little filly . The boys are intrigued by the typewriters and my screen career . Particularly Ham ( Hamilton ) Parks who , one evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was going to " be " an author . Ham is swarthy , heavy-set , something of a football star alreadyand a true extrovert if ever there was one . His choice of a career surprised me . Now if it had been Billy AllengerBilly is seventeen , goes to college next year , and is our tallest boy : six feet two . He is pale and rather distinguished looking , wears dark-rimmed glasses , seldom speaks , never smiles , looks like a New York businessman of about thirty  --  one of " these sad young men . " 128I asked Ham Parks about his writing . " Of course , " he said modestly , " I do n't know how yet , but I 'm going to major in it . " I then asked him whether he had written short stories . Articles . No  --  what then ? His shoulders lifted superciliously . " Just whatever I had to do at school . " " Are you a good letter writer ? " He delighted the boys by making the face of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you mean  --  about becoming an author ? " He was patient with me . " What I said  --  I 'm going to major in it . " " Why choose that if you already know you do n't like it ? " " There was an author who came and lived near us in the country one summer . He had a Pullman trailer hitched to his car . He had to live where he was alone . I like the woods . I like to fish . What a snap ! " I asked Harry what he was going to be . " A psychiatrist . " Harry 's near-sighted eyes , through those heavy-lensed glasses , peered inquiringly around , but no one laughed at this . " My Aunt Jennie went to a psychiatrist every day for a year . And my Dad said she paid him a fortune . All he did was sit and listen to her talk . " They have all been to psychiatrists or know about them , and enjoy explaining about their complexes . Presently I was asked if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in Hollywood if you write for the screen . Here , I 'm writing for magazines . Trying to , that is  --  " " How do you mean ? Trying to ? " " Trying to get them published , I mean . " There was a puzzled , disapproving silence . This was not the way a successful career should go . So I added , reassuringly , " And I think I 'm getting close . " " How do you mean  --  close ? " " Well , now I 'm getting rejections , and that 's really very close to succeeding , you know , just one step away  --  " Murmurs of disgust . Success should come , of course , like afternoon tea being wheeled in on a tea wagon. 129 " One step ! " " Yes . I 've taken all the others . Thought up the story . Played with the idea . Decided against it , decided for it  --  a dozen times . Finally wrote it . That means paper , typing , carbons , revisions , time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , weighing and stamping , mailing ; then getting the script back . That 's a lot . " " And the one step more ? " " You get a check instead of the script . And a different kind of letter . " They mulled this over . " You could tell Ham how to write , could n't you , Aunt Marie ? " ( Jerome has done considerable writing himself . ) I laughed . " Well , I could tell him a good many ways hownot to  --  " They all wanted to hear how not to . " Well  --  do not be : literary or academic or precise or stilted or precious or woozy ( not too woozy ) or wordy or repetitious or long-winded or childish or kittenish or cute or clever  --  " " Gosh ! What does that leave you ? " " But tell us what to do then . " This was harder . Actually two or three tips have pulled me through many a jam . When I first began , in the Hollywood studios , to translate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of meticulously described photographs ) , I asked a veteran , " But how do you ever know how to begin ? " And he answered , " Just tell your story . " This never fails . In imagination I place my small boy across the room from me , direct my eyes on that eager listening face , and begin . Rule Two I got out of an English book that had a writer for heroine ; and once , all tangled up , she said to herself in exasperation , " Now can I put a few simple thoughts into plain English or can I not ? " And she immediately found she could . When I passed on these two invaluable rules to the boys they found them very disappointing , as all true observations seem to be. 130Bobbie asked , " But what if you get stuck ? I 'm always getting stuck somewhere in my compositions . " " Well , then , if I 'm at the typewriter , I change to lying on the bed . Or the hammock . Or going for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gabble broke out which I finally interrupted by : " It 's perfectlytrue . If I 've invented something when I 'm lying on the bed , and then try to expand it when I 'm sitting at the typewriter , I have to go back to the bed to get the rest of it . " More of the gabble , through which Jerome 's charming , sustainedchuckle persisted . He finally said , " Aunt Marie , is n't that being woozy ? " " It certainly is . " " Just what is woozy , Mrs. Bergwin ? " This from our usually silent Jimmie . " Well  --  let 's investigate this word by finding all its opposites . " This precipitated them into a wrangle in which I could eat a few mouthfuls in peace , while I listened to words emerge . Factual . Cut-and-dried . Precise . Mechanical . With some steering from me , they finally came up with physicaland metaphysical which I approved , and then asked if anyonecould define the point at which physical passed over into metaphysical . Just before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this  --  that there is no such exact point  --  and Jerome contributed the final words , " That 's why you can be a little woozy ? " At first the boys are scornful of taking a rest in the middle of the day , but gradually they come to like the quiet hour . Many of them fall asleep . The biggest boys sleep the longest . Each cabin accommodates two boys . The floors and the lower half of the walls are of wood . Above that is wire screen . A roof pole and rafters support a canvas tent fly with side flaps that roll down in case of rain . The little encampment is in a grove of young pines , on the gentle slope of land behind the house . It is kept in good order under the eye of the Officer of the Day . At the end of the summer , when the boys have left , I some-131times go up there and stretch out on one of the cots . I hear the murmur of the pine needles and smell the sharp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you away from any city . It puts you out of doors , and far away and alone . I found this out early in life , when as children we would be taken to the woods for part of our vacation . The boys will never forget it . The first week or two of camp , there is considerable strain for both Michael and me . I can see it on his face  --  a hard look . It is not only that it takes time for him to get them really in hand , there is constant worry about the horses and possibilities of accidents . Riding comes after the quiet hour . One boy is appointed to bring the horses in from the Stable Pasture . It is a mile square and full of rough hill-and-dale terrain , and the horses are scattered . But they know they will get oats as soon as they reach the corral and are eager to come . The horse ridden on this daily round-up is always Gold Coin , a wise old fellow who knows every trick and could almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it is excellent training for balance and hands . I enjoy being in the corral to watch the fourteen lively broncs sweep in at a gallop . Then every horse is haltered , his nose bag of oats put on ; he is tied to a post of the corral fence and groomed by his rider . We have one fifteen-year-old boy , Redding Brewster , who has already done a good deal of riding . He is blond , handsome , well set-up . Michael has given him Rheingold ; they are very well balanced and look magnificent together . The other day Rheingold was misbehaving , pulling at the rope as Red tried to tie him in his place . He balked , braced his legs , wig-wagged his head and acted , in general , as if he had never even been halter-broken . The punishment for such behavior is to be tied for a while to the snubbing post in the middle of the corral  --  a sort of dunce 's stool . Rheingold was thus humiliated and stood quietly now , with his nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from132that unpleasant Post . Then , when at Michael 's orders , Red un- tied him , the stallion seemed to attack his young master . They 've been arguing about it ever since  --  did Rheingold really intend to strike Red down , or did he just rear over him ? At any rate , the horse jerked loose and reared ; Red turned to get out of the way , but slipped and went down on all fours as the big hoof came down . I was there . There was a sound  --  sort of groan or exclamation from everyone . Michael scooped Red up , held him hanging face downward over his left arm while , with his right , he tore off the slashed blue jean trousers . I could see the awful dread on Mi- chael 's face for that second in which he expected to see the sort of wound that would be made by a down-pawing stroke of a stallion 's hoof . But Red was unhurt  --  there was not even a scratch on the smooth white buttocks . Rheingold had plunged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corral fence , subdued now , and waiting to be curry-combed . His head was turned around and his ears pricked to see what was happening back there at the snubbing post . Michael set Red down and he stood grinning , embarrassed for his bare behind . Someone yelled , " Where 's your pants ? " and when Michael jocularly draped the torn blue jeans over the snub- bing post there were whistles and cheers . No more trouble between Red and Rheingold . While the boys groom their horses , Michael goes from one to the other , giving directions . The curry-comb and brush must be run down the hind legs . This is hard for the broncs to endure . It tickles them . Michael teaches the boys how to stand while they do it ; they must be on the alert , ready to dodge ; above all , they must hang on to the horse 's haunches so that if there is a sudden kick they are not in just the right place to receive it . Nose bags and halters are then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All the exercises are done without saddles . Mounting from the ground with no saddle is difficult . Many a boy is left in the corral , struggling to get on his horse , when the rest of the troop is riding down to the practice field. 133This is a level area of the meadow between cow barn and creek . The drill actually quiets the horses . Standing in a row or circle , knowing that the reins are loose , feeling the boys slide all over them , slithering off , climbing on again , the broncs get completely relaxed and enjoy themselves . I can see the field from the terrace , and at this hour I usually am there to watch the maneuvers . The boys do " scissors " on their mounts  --  Michael doing it first . This turns them so they are sitting facing the horse 's tail . Then they do it again , to bring them facing front . Then Michael does a handstand , placing both hands on the horse 's withers , leaning forward till all his weight is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body from the back of the horse and gradually up in the air , till his legs are straight , pointing upward . The boys struggle with this . Occasionally there is an expert gymnast who can do it . There is frequent falling off , which Michael intends . He disapprovesof tense clinging to the back of the horse , anticipating the disaster of " being thrown . " For if your balance is lost you 're already thrown , in a manner of speaking , and you 'd be better off than on . The rider should slide or jump to the ground , leap on again . So they practice jumping on and off at a walk , trot , canter . This adroitness is learned gradually , through the summer . It is referred to in our advertising folder under the heading of The Study of Equitation . When the hour of drill is over , the boys are free to do as they please . This usually means more riding , probably to some distant spot . They have visited every ranch around . The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saddle up . But gradually , as they feel more secure , they just turn from the practice field , kick their horses and tear off bareback , whooping , galloping like a band of Indians . I finished the ink copy of Joy in the Morning , mailed it at Granite Canyon , and brought back the incoming mail . I always sit down in my hammock to distribute the mail , and the boys134cluster around . I noticed a large envelope with the address written in the handsome caligraphy of a genius . I wondered what he could be sending me and opened it to find my Invention in G Minor . He must have sent it back almost by return mail . There was not a correction on it , only one big word scrawled across the bottom of the page , STUNNING . And there was a short letter : " If your Invention in G Minor had been handed in at the University it would have won the prize in Counterpoint . Who has taught you Counterpoint ? " I am thinking seriously about this . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a par with the first , and I feel sure it is , then it seems that this is fairly easy for me to do . If I composed a dozen of them they might be offered a publisher as a series of modern contrapuntal pieces for a student to work with before tackling Bach . But this would be quite a job  --  and I do not particularlyenjoy it . I will wait to discuss this with Mr. Spencer when I get to Los Angeles . So now I shall take up the study of Thematic Development . I have books by Goetschius and de Lavignac on this . De Lavignac says , Early in the piece the composer makes a note of those scraps , fragments , tag-ends of melody which , later , he will use to develop his themes and fill out the body of his work . This is something I have always done unconsciously . But to know what I am doing and why , to become acquainted with the classic forms and patterns will , I believe , greatly shorten my labors . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my reservoir of manuscripts which is ready and waiting to have its thematic material " developed . " I am thinking of Bagatelle . I composed this some years ago in Los Angeles . When I played it to Mr. Spencer he completely mystified me by shouting , " You savage ! " He hurried to the door of the anteroom , flung it open , and called to the waiting students to come in . I had to play the piece again for them . Afterwards I asked him , " But why savage ? " 135 " Because you broke every rule in harmony with that descendingrun in parallel sixths and justified it by making a tremendouslyeffective passage . " As I was playing this over , Jerome burst into the room . " What 's that ? I like it . Play it again . " If , long ago , it made Mr. Spencer cross the room  --  if , now , it has made Jerome come running  --  it must have something . " But I do n't like that title  --  Bagatelle , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it is n't . " No . It has a hard , driving vigor . " I 'm thinking of making a big piece out of it  --  perhaps a recital piece . " " I 'd like to learn it . " But I can not decide . It seems just right as it is  --  three pages long ; and to tear it to pieces  --  " develop " it  --  would destroy its bold free flight . Oats , say all the government pamphlets , are best for feeding young stock ; calves , dogs , horses . ( The Scots raise their tall hardy men on oatmeal . ) " Bobbie , " I said , " I notice you take oatmeal for breakfast . Do you like it ? " " Yes , I love it . " I serve the breakfast cereals in colored bowls of Mexican ware . " Could you  --  er  --  eat more  --  if you had a bigger bowl ? " With some embarrassment Bobbie answered that yes , hethought he could . Now I have substituted for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen . He fills this with oatmeal , adds a cupful of thick yellow cream and a cupful of brown sugar . This he takes as a preliminary to his breakfast of bacon and eggs , toast , milk , fruit. 136Chapter 19Michael and I drove over to Granite Canyon for the mail and I waited in the car while he went into the Post Office . When he came out he thrust a parcel at me . For a moment I could not think what it was , then saw the name Schirmer , and remembered . " Oh ! It 's my pieces ! " I cried . " My complimentary copies ! " " What pieces ? " " My four teaching pieces that Schirmer bought ! " Michael was interested . I tore off the wrappings and we examinedthem . Schirmer had put them out very nicely ; very artistic , really , a cunning little picture of a " Papoose " in swaddlingclothes . A wee vignette of a tree " Blown by the Wind . " Michael seemed really impressed . Later he asked me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out on the piano ? " " What pieces ? " Still more indignantly , " Those pieces Schirmer just pub-lished . " " Oh ! Do you think I ought to ? " " Certainly ! " So I put them out . " Now play them . " " These ? " I was surprised . " Why they 're just tiny things . Nothingat all really . And you 've heard them over and over . They 're nothing worth listening to . " " Play them ! " I opened the pages of When the Wind Blows and set it on the rack . I had forgotten it long ago and had to read it . I am a poor137reader at best  --  frightful at worst  --  and this was the worst , with Michael expecting something marvelous just because Schirmer has published them  --  expecting to be bragging about them to the boys in another minute . I stumbled through it , wondering why on earth Schirmer had bought it . It was correct , rather clever , really had something , but stillWhen I finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't see why they bought it . " Then I realized his face was convulsed . At my remark he burst into stentorian shouts of laughter , nearly sobbing . " I ca n't either . " He laughed until he almost cried . I could n't help laughing with him , but I felt a small misery and a large confusion . Several of the boys came into the room . Quiet hour was over and they were getting ready to ride . I played the piece again , blaming the poor effect on my bad reading . Jerome stood beside the piano listening attentively . " It sounds like a fugue right there at the beginning , " he said . I felt supported . I noticed that in spite of the small size of it , so bare , unornamented , stripped down to its bones  --  just music in miniature really  --  it did have feeling . And a sort of signifi- cance . I played it several times . The other boys left with Michael . Jerome stayed . I began to feel irritated that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushed the music away and played it by ear with as effective an arrangement as came easily to my hands . I was surprised at how free and rampaging it was ; quite a dramatic little whirlwind of a piece , suitable to the title , When the Wind Blows . " Worthwhile that way , is n't it ? " said Jerome . This is what irks me about these teaching pieces . Good ma- terial , good musical ideas , just thrown away . And why do I do it ? For these four pieces Schirmer offered me fifty dollars cash . I replied that I would prefer royalties . They replied , " No royal- ties . " Fifty dollars take it or leave it . I took it. 138And when , long ago , John Church Publishing Company publishedmy collection of six teaching pieces called Summer Days at Deercreek ( and the biggest music store in Los Angeles filled its window with them ) I was paid twenty-five dollars for the six . No royalties . And for the three a little more advanced which were published @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we have another musician on the ranch . This is little Scotty . He has got this nickname because his familyis Scottish  --  last name McCollister . Scotty can sit down at the piano , reach for the pedal and play The Happy Farmer with accuracy and spirit . This sensitive child is carrying a heavy burden . He is the youngest and smallest boy in the crowd . He is on a horse that is always given to baby beginners . He can not get on him alone . Every other boy can annihilate him with a word . No , they do n't need a word . Just by being what they are , bigger and older than he , they demolish him . Harry has only to look at him brightly , the corners of his Puckish mouth turned up , and say in a kindly manner but in that loud voice which makes everyone turn and listen , " Well , Scotty ? " and every boy at the table bursts out laughing . A scarlet flush creeps up Scotty 's neck and cheeks and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these are tears of helpless rage . What can I do about this ? Nothing , that I can think of . Scotty sits at my left at the table . I feel we could converse very comfortablyif he were not every moment under siege and in an attitude of defense . But now , with the music , we have really got together . There is one of the teaching pieces which I think he could learn . When I was working on them last winter I placed them in groups of six . Six bird-song themes . Six little nature studies . And the group I called a Musical Travelogue was a set of national dances . I completed a German , a Swiss , a Spanish , a Scotch , an Irish , and I wanted a Swedish. 139This series was written not from authentic folk melodies , but in the style of the folk music of each country . Madchen Tanz ( Schirmer used English words instead of German ) is a little spinning German waltz with a few measures of the Blue Danube in it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kilts swing ! " cried Reese when I played it to him . ) I knew no Swedish music nor had I ever heard their folk songs . How should I get the inspiration for a Swedish piece ? Spencer once said , " Anything resembling folk melodies is difficult to compose . They are not made . They just grow . If you write anything like that you 've done something . " I have thought a good deal about the manner in which a folk song could come into being . The seed of it , the soil , the growth . Surely the seed is emotion  --  hot from the human heart . If I myself , in a mood of loneliness and longing , stood at a window and reached out my arms and cried , " Oh , come back to me ! Come back ! Come back ! " it is almost a song already . If such a cry should become rhythmic , then immediately it is a song . It would become rhythmic if it were accompanied by some routine action . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , holding a child in her arms and rocking him and hum- ming . Then to make it rhythmic  --  then to find the wordsShip she sailed , across the sea , Goodby my lover , goodby ! It 's taking my lover away from meGoodby my lover , goodby . By Oh ! My bay  --  bee ! By Oh ! My bay  --  bee ! By Oh ! My bay  --  bee ! Goodby my lover , Goodby ! ( I used to sing that to a little figure in long white nightdraw- ers  --  his bullet head pressed on my bosom , my arms wrapped around him , the rocking chair swinging back and forth , the day waning and the blue dark beginning to fill the windows . ) Songs that go with rocking the cradle and burying the dead , 140with grieving and loving , with greeting and leave-taking and planting and harvesting and merrymaking and fairing  --  these are folk songs . The book The Negro and His Songs by Howard Odum and Guy Johnson tells of a university don who wished to study the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near his house . So he took notebook and pencil and sat himself on a rock wall near them ; and after long listening made out the words of their song : White man settin ' on the wall , White man settin ' on the wall . White man settin ' on the wallJust wastin ' his timeWastin ' his time ! How should I get the inspiration for a simple Swedish folk tune ? We had at that time a Swedish foreman whose name was Nels , and I put it to him one evening up in the bunkhouse that I was sure he knew all sorts of Swedish songs and dances and tunes . But Nels shook his head shyly . " Oh , yes you do , Nels ! You know  --  at the fairs , at outdoor dances , how did they dance ? What kind of steps ? What kind of songs ? Did the boys pick the girls up and throw them around ? Did they run ? Or stamp ? Or what ? " Suddenly Nels put down his pipe and jumped up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stamping on the bunkhousefloor but he told me what actions went with the song . Bonde Danse means farmer dance . And it would be in the spring , after plowing and planting , that they would all gather in the birch groves , and the young girls and young men would sing and dance . He described the clothes they wore ; the full brightly colored skirts of the girls , and how , when they whirled , their drawers would show . Nels 's face became pink and sentimental when he described the two-inch wide band of handmade lace on the edge of the drawer legs , for , all his childhood , he had seen his mother141crocheting this lace , and as they grew up , his sisters too . It was to be sewn on innumerable pairs of knee-length white linen drawers . I once heard my grandmother exclaim in a tone of horror , " Just think ! " and roll up her eyes and toss up her hands , when someone told her of a friend who had seven daughters . " Think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little Swedish piece , following the exact rhythm of Nels 's stamping feet , called it Bonde Danse , placed it in the Musical Travelogue group , and felt it was the best of the lot . Evidently Schirmer did not , for it was not one they selected . I could see everything in it Nels had talked about . The birch grove with the fluttering green leaves of spring , stampings and leapings of the tall , stalwart , tight-trousered young men , whirlingskirts of the girls , and the happy , laughing , screaming young faces  --  the marvelous thrust and spring of the hot blood of youth carrying them all off the ground and into the air  --  and this was mixed , in the peculiar way in which a human mind can mix up its visions and dreams , with the sight of our own Nets , stamping and leaping there in the bunkhouse kitchen , lit by a few old oil lamps , and the striped dish towels hanging by the sink behind him . " Come , Scotty , see if you 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's called Bonde Danse . " Scotty slid onto the piano bench . I set up the music . Harry stood by , squinting and listening , mouth drawn up in his Puckish grin  --  all ready to spoof . I remarked , laughing , " Harry , you could n't learn this if your life depended on it . But now you watch Scotty . " Scotty learned it without difficulty and it gave me a peculiar pleasure to hear a little boy play it and interpret it in his own individual way . Harry listened for a while , as we worked at it , then grinning , squinting , drifted out to the terrace . Scotty played it one evening after supper with everyone listeningand sitting quietly , at Michael 's command. 142While he played it , I leaned on the side of the piano , hearing all that could have been in that music , but was not . I was thinking of Liszt 's wonderful concert pieces , the HungarianRhapsodies . These had been developed from simple littleHungarian folk tunes . In the extraordinary way in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every note present in one 's mind simultaneously  --  I remembered those concert pieces as I have heard them played many times in Carnegie Hall ( and with them always a surge of excitement in the audience ) and could excise out of the concert arrangement the simple little tune that had given them birth  --  now the themeThere was an example of Thematic Development ! How had he done it ? How had he been able to take small jinglesthat could be played by children 's little hands and evoke out of them these massive , thundering , reverberating , soaring mobilizations of harmonies and melodies ? I listened to Scotty play the Bonde Danse , and began to note what de Lavignac had named the " scraps , fragments , tag-ends of melody which , later , the composer will . . . develop . . . to fill out the body of his work , " and I did truly begin to notice them , and they began to leap and plunge in my mind like unrulyhorses . I could hear the chords crashing , the girls whirling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was a concert arrangement , parts of it , and that my work would be to hear it , unite it into a whole , bring my critical powers to bear on it , shape it to a classic pattern ; and finally write it down . It was overwhelming . And I felt as if I had received a shock , when little Scotty finished and rose from the piano bench and stood there a moment , facing the room and the burst of applause . His cheeks were pink with pleasure . This afternoon , in the corral , I noticed one boy helping another to mount . Red was helping Scotty . There is a look of responsibility about Red unusual in a boy of fifteen . I have asked him if he has a lot of younger brothers and sisters ; but no , he is an only child . Red opened the strap of Baldy 's stirrup and let it down , then helped Scotty to get his foot into it . Then as Scotty was clawing143at various parts of the saddle , yelling , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Red , with a clutch on the seat of his pants , gave him just the boost he needed . Now that all these boys have joined our family group , Rachel is completely out of hand . I had particularly made up my mind that since she is quite large she must be trained to keep off sofas and beds ; she , of course , would like not only to jump on beds , but sleep on them . Fourteen boys  --  fourteen beds  --  all the boys aiding and abetting herAll she has to do is disappear at locking-up time , stay away until all lights are out and all danger of capture past , then go to one of the cabins and whine . Next time I go to town I shall buy a brush with stiff bristles suitable for brushing the long curly hair of an English setter , and a leather harness and leash . And I shall roll up a newspaper with which to smack her . Everyone fondles and pets her , everyone feeds her , no one has ever raised a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love me. 144Chapter 20To a city dog the sight of a harness and leash can only be a delight . But a country dog is out already and owns the world . How could I make Rachel fond of her leash and harness ? The hour of training takes place on the terrace . At that time of morning when the boys have gone off to work and the house is empty except for Hilda busy in the kitchen and Fumiko doing the upstairs work , the sun is lazy and warm , there is not simply too much distraction all around , and , really , there is no better place to be than right here , with the box of biscuit , the blue bowl , the eggs and me . Not that this last as yet means much , for she loves everybody , but it is evident that there has begun to be something a little special about me . There are also some strange and peculiar-looking things on the terrace , which she has never seen before . She sniffs at brush , leash , harness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The brushing comes first . I allow her only a few licks of egg , then explain that now she must wait a little for the rest . I lift her to the bench , hold her with one hand , and begin the brushing with the other , talking to her , explaining . Now and then her hind quarters collapse and I must lift her again by jaw and tail into show-dog position and shame her a little with my voice . There was some whimpering protest at first , and a few times she turned and snapped at the brush . But a dog loves all attention and handling provided it is done with gentlenessand love . My voice comforts her  --  also occasional licks from the blue bowl . Next , the harness . She got used to seeing it there mixed up with the biscuits and145the blue bowl . One day , after brushing , when we were both lying on the grass I made passes at her with the harness , and she responded with licks and waggings . I slipped it over her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She showed curiosity , sniffed at it , turned a couple of circles , then forgot it and sat down on me again . I pulled her around by it to get her used to the feeling of the straps on her body . She did not mind . Obviously I was just playing with her . Then I attached the leash and stood up . We went for a short walk . I dreaded the first violent check . The moment came . She scented something , stood quivering a moment , then launched herself and was almost thrown on her side by the leash . Recovering and realizing that she was not free , she stood trembling , and strained , her eyes boring into the distance . Then she flung herself on me with a barrage of pleading cries . Please ! Oh please let me go ! No , Rachel . You 're going to stay here with me now . A moment or two more of that taut trembling , then she gave up and forgot it . We returned to the terrace . I sat down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at last I slipped the leash off and set her free she was not aware of it . The four short stories that I have had out knocking at the doors of the magazine publishing houses have now all been returned . The last one came today and with it a rejection note from the Atlantic Monthly which said , " The manuscript which we are returning to you has been among those in which we have taken a special interest ; and if through press of work it is not possible for us to write you a personal letter , we hope you will realize that we have enjoyed your work and are greatly obliged for your courtesy in sending it . " As I know from experience that the Atlantic Monthly has other less encouraging form letters , this offers a whiff of encouragement . What I have neglected to do is to " slant " my offerings to the146proper magazines . " Literary " stories should not be sent to the " slicks " and vice versa . But most of my stories , I think , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is for me . I like to tell a real tale , create a little suspense , make the listener open his eyes . So I have to put my point of view into it . The literary story of today , it seems to me , deletes the point of view ( a la Chekhov ) . I have heard the typical Chekhov story described as being a presentation of life without any intrusion of the author at all . Just show your people , make the reader watch what they do , hear what they say , and let the reader draw his own conclusions . Lest you have , at the beginning , set down anything that might introduce , or at the end , anything that might interpret , chop off the beginning and end of your story . Now this does not fit my idea of a story at all . This , I claim , is a vignette . Vignettes are fascinating . I was all agog one day in New York listening to snatches of conversation I heard on the streets . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind me exclaimed . " Yes , siree ! One hundred thousand buttons ! And I  --  " Or , two girls walking together , one saying , " Can you imagine ? And I had gone to him for consolation ! " Or , one young fellow telling another , " My job ? Just pickin ' ' em up and puttin ' ' em down , pickin ' ' em up and puttin ' ' em down  --  " And Eugenie , telling me about a dinner party she had gone to . And when I asked her if they had played bridge afterward , said , " No ! What do you think we did all evening ? " I could not guess . It turned out they had amused themselves by looking at what I shall call vignettes of real life . It was a hot night . They turned the lights out , sat in the dark , watching what went on in an apartment across the street where the shades had not been pulled down . Definitely Chekhov . There is a vignette that appears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is when I am sleeping in the pine room downstairs . The windows there have very deep embrasures ; the casing147is of light pine . Outside the window , just below the sill , is a little wrought-iron bracket with a ring which holds a pot of geraniums . When I wake early in the morning and see by the soft glimmer that the sun is just rising , I sit up against pillows and watch that smooth panel of pine , for I know that I shall see on it presently , when the long slanting rays of the sun are strong enough , the shadow of the geranium plant . It appears ! A vignette ! The most charming picture , blossoms , leaves , pot , and I wonder why the reflection of something that is already lovely can be still more lovely . But is it not always so ? An artist 's painting of a tree more beautiful than the tree itself , or a girl 's face in a mirror  --  something is added . And then , once , there appeared on that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hummingbird , fluttering with sudden flirts and lifts , plunging his beak in a blossom , then withdrawing , plunging again  --  then , unbelievably , a second hummingbirdWhat a vignette  --  but not a story . Sooner or later every writer evolves his own definition of astory . Mine is : A reflection of life plus beginning and end ( life seems not to have either ) and a meaning . Rachel is making rapid progress . This morning I took her for a long walk with me , on a short leash , and she paced at my side in a ladylike manner , not protesting , although I held the leash pretty short . The time came , of course , when she forgot it and lunged , and was caught by the throat . It happened just once more . The next time , starting to leap , she checked and glanced at me , as if to say , " Oh , I forgot ! Excuse it , please . " It did not happen again . When I praise her and caress her , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone with me as much as I can . When the boys are assembled on the terrace or in the living room , Rachel and I are apt to be off by ourselves somewhere . Sometimes I go up to my room early , taking her with me . I make myself comfortable against pillows in bed with a book , and Rachel lies stretched out , a ravishing figure of grace on the dark burgundy carpet . She knows there are puppy biscuits on148the bedside table and sometimes gets up , stretches , yawns , and comes nosing to my hand for a pat or a biscuit , then turns away ; and with a deep sigh of comfort , flops . She lies with her head on her paws , her eyes flicking to me at every page I turn . Sometimes my solitary occupations pall , and the loneliness that is inherent in human life  --  even more oppressive , I think , when it is in the midst of a crowd  --  makes my breath drag . And I find myself wishing there were some women of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gossip and maybe play bridge  --  and I remember the early days of my marriage in Los Angeles when four of us would meet each week in the afternoon to play bridge at a quarter of a cent a point , and one of us would make a batch of fudge and there it would sit beside the table , until we had finished the game and the fudge and paid our small debts and it was time to go home to our husbands and small children and dinners . Eugenie wo n't be here till the second week in August . I find I 'm waiting for her . But then , I 'm always waiting . If I 'm with Michael and the boys , then suddenly I must get away . And Rachel and Pompadour and I go off together . And if I 'm up there on top of the world , suddenly I have to get back . Yesterday I could n't be alone at all . Simply could not be left to myself . I wanted the impact of happy voices or any sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horses on my eyes . I wanted to watch movement  --  the boys ' bodies as they did their scissors and handstands , as they vaulted or tumbled off and leaped or scrambled on . ( It 's amazing how quickly they have learned . ) So I went down to the practice field when they were doing monkey drill and sat against a fence post to watch . I sat with my arms around my knees , a sprig of mint between my teeth , thinking about loneliness  --  trying to fight it out . Since every human soul must live and die alone it is strange that from birth onward we struggle to escape this solitary confinement . Eyes , hands , hearts , reach out , always supplicating for companionship  --  forits culmination and consummation in union . All the long childhood and adolescence we wait , straining eager eyes through , the mist to see that point in the road ahead149there  --  that magic point , where the miracle waits for us . Then , when we 've grown up , we rush upon our destiny and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through love or through art or through religion , we receive  --  what ? Something . A hint of union , perhaps . A moment 's surcease . Then the cold fog barriers drift down again , enswathing , separating , isolating . And the anguish of disunion and loneliness is sharper than ever . Even lovers are thrust apart . Oh , the pity of it , that loving you as I do , loving me as you do , yet this abyss between usShouts of laughter interrupted my thoughts . We have one ridiculous little animal that must be called a horse since it is nothing else . A guess would make it a cross between a pony and burro with head and ears like a mule , a fat belly , short piano legs and a black stripe down its backbone . It is called Skippy and is uncannily smart . It plagues the other horses ; they plague it . When we hear a barrage of squeals and kicks we know that Skippy has started something . In our school of equitation Skippy is the dunce 's stool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to live up to our traditions is made to sit upon Skippy facing her tail with his arms folded . What Skippy has to do is ignore him , go about grazing  --  and she never fails to do it . It is Harry on the dunce 's stool . He is thoroughly enjoying it . The boys shout and whistle , gallop around him . Skippy continuesher quiet grazing . . . . Lightning split the sky . I looked up , startled , to see black clouds , and suddenly it began to pour . The practice troop took off for the stables and Michael gallopedup to me , dismounted , and put me on Juanita , whom I am not supposed to ride because she 's too much horse for me . He gave her a whack on the rump which started her off with a leap that like to unseat me . All this rain ! Hardly a day without a downpour ! Wonderful for the hay . I walk through it measuring it against my body . Up to my knees , halfway up my thighs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big event of the summer is the covered-wagon trig across the plains to attend " Frontier Days , " the rodeo that i held the last week of July . It is a western summer festival on a large scale and is nick named The Daddy of Them All and that 's probably true . It is a week of wild-west shows held in Frontier Park , just out side of Cheyenne . The grandstand accommodates a hundrea thousand . It attracts visitors from all over this country and fron across the seas too . It features bronco-busting , bull-dogging , covered-wagon races Indian races ; any sort of western stunt that is violent , exciting dangerous , guaranteed to break bones , spill blood , put men ( an ( sometimes girls ) into the hospital , and occasionally kill . Two ambulances are on the grounds at every show ; and nc the least exciting moment of the afternoon is when the roar fror the grandstands rises quickly , is suddenly broken off , and ther is silence while every eye is on a still figure stretched out ther @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a questionin note , and the sudden clanging of a bell , as one of the ambulance rolls out across the arena . Before the show , comes the Frontier Days Parade , and this , t , my mind , is the best part of the whole thing . There is a Queen attended by her lady-in-waiting , two beau tiful girls dressed in white breeches , handsomely tooled whit leather cowboy boots , soft white suede Indian fringed tunic ! white leather gauntlets and immense white sombreros . They rid two matched Palomino horses at the head of the procession . Soldiers and officers in uniform ( from Fort Russell Warren are everywhere and brass hands play constantly. 151Lastly there are the pioneer women driven in surreys and buckboards with escorts of frontiersmen on horseback . The women of Cheyenne ransack their attics and old trunks to find costumes that belonged to their grandmothers or great- grandmothers ; flounced skirts , leg-o-mutton sleeves , poke bon- nets . They wave lace-edged handkerchiefs , bestow smiles right and left , carry parasols ; are driven in style behind slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the week of the festival there are many parties and both men and women wear a sort of fancy dress . The men have evolved a dashing half-military outfit ; snug , tan gabardine trous- ers , a matching pleated shirt , Mexican string tie , flat sombrero . They shine with polish and look very handsome . The women are not so uniform . At a cocktail party at the Governor 's man- sion I saw brilliant colored tights with braided tunics , numbers of " squaw " costumes  --  silver-spangled pleated skirts in turquoise , yellow , or red ; I saw one storybook vision in palest pink tights and sweater with long golden hair flowing down her back . To get from our ranch to Cheyenne is only thirty miles . But Michael has plotted a route across the plains which is about twice that distance . They have to camp out one night and are accompanied by a chuck wagon with the traditional white canvas cover of the old prairie schooners . They arrive at their allotted camping place in Frontier Park on a Saturday and spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ranch I always have to put one or two to bed with an indisposition , which we call Frontier Fever . All the strenuous horse-backing of the first three weeks of our camp term is to prepare for this trip . Each boy has to know not only how to ride but how to care for his mount and equipment . The date for this expedition is approaching and already it is practically the only topic of conversation . What horses will be ridden ? What colts will be along ? For if Mamma goes , baby must go too . How much money has each boy saved up to spend at the rodeo ? Harry Brimmer , it appears , has had it in his head ever since he arrived to ride in the bull-dogging contest at the show . He and Michael have hour-long arguments about it to which152we all listen . For some reason this makes me frantic . Will Michaellet him or not ? Harry wants an animal to practice on . Ham suggested the Roamer , which I vetoed . Michael finally agreed to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cow barn so that Harry can practice . Now , every evening after supper , we go down and lean against the corral fence , waiting for Harry to explode out of the barn door on this white heifer . She throws him immediately , whirls to face him , nose down , all four feet braced , and waits for him to get up and mount her so she can throw him again . Frederick Martin 's horse , Shag ( so called because he 's good at shagging polo balls ) , has sprained his shoulder , as he does every so often . And Fred is almost ill with anxiety lest the horse will not be able to go to Frontier . This Frederick is another boy I can not understand . ( Billy Allenger was the first . ) If there is anything Fred wants he becomeswhite with passion . His eyelids widen until you can see white all around the pupil . And this is over nothing at all  --  his desire to have a certain place in line , his wish to have the boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Puzzling , but interesting . To save the lame shoulder , Shag is not allowed to take part in afternoon monkey drill . Like an old fire horse when he sees the engine going to a fire without him , Shag whinnies wildly , runs down to the field riderless , gets into line and performs with the other horses . All the boys roar , " Look at Shag ! He does n't want to be left out ! " Fred goes to Shag , draws him out of the crowd and stands apart holding his head , caressing him , whispering secrets to him . Then goes around to all the boys and asks each one individually to be sure not to jump on Shag , or call him , or in any way interfere with him . And I notice that strange look on the boy 's face , almostbeside himself . Riley is excited about driving the chuck wagon , and has a brand-new ten-gallon hat , new blue jeans that are turned up to his bandy knees , and cowboy boots so high-heeled that he minces153from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milking . Hilda and Fumiko are getting ready for holidays in town , for I give them plenty of time off during Rodeo week . Old George and I will keep the ranch . We will do the milking , morning and evening . If there is anything we can not manage , Rube Haygood will ride over from his ranch and lend us a hand . Often George and I have been here alone together . He comes down into my kitchen and gets a meal for me now and then . He is slow , exact , scrupulously clean ; accustomed , from many lonely winters as caretaker on western ranches , to all departmentsof housekeeping . He is supposed to work with the horses , too , but Michael says he is afraid of them with his " troop . " He has ordered bales of hay to be set down there in a long row . Near it a picket line will be stretched to which the horses can be tied . The chuck wagon has been mended , spruced up , greased , properly equipped . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all kinds . Most of the boys will be riding geldings , but there is Red 's young stallion , Rheingold . Michael had some doubts about this and thought of giving Red a different horse for the trip . But Red was brokenhearted , so he relented . There will be several dry mares and four with foals at foot  --  Juanita , Falla , Bonnie and Glory . Heretofore the old work team , Fanny and Captain , have always made the trip , but Michael wants the young team to have the experience , so this year it will be Ginger and Jock . An extra horse will be taken , tied behind the wagon . This will be Baby , who is either light work or saddle . The boys are always asking how the horses get their names and can not see why such a big husky is called Baby . I tell them that her whole name is Poor Baby . This is worse yet , so I explainthat when she was a month old she lost her mother ; and the154first time I put the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baby . " " I bet I know how Bonnie got her name  --  from the song My Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean , ' was n't it ? " " Wrong . We had been waiting for that birth a long time . And when at last the colt came I said a la bonheur . Now if you know French , you know what that means  --  " " You could have called her Ala . Can I name a foal Ala ? " Usually when I let the boys name foals they come up with something from the race track  --  Madame X and Fraidy Cat . But Ala sounds quite smart . There has been another near accident . Again  --  it might have been so serious yet turned out to be nothing . Ham and Harry , after a long ride the other afternoon , were down in the pasture doing stunts . They were feeling their oats and made their horses rear . As they were bareback it was not too easy to stick on . Jazz went up on his hind legs obligingly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ham pulled him higher . Jazz went higher  --  Ham gripped tight  --  Jazz went over backward . Ham stuck on and the horse fell on him . I have seen Michael pull a horse over backward to discipline him  --  slide out of the saddle , be standing on the ground when the horse lit , and mount him again as he scrambled to his feet . The first I knew of the accident I saw Michael walking up from the meadow carrying a boy over his shoulder . Ham could n't walk ; one leg would not work . The backbone of the horse had come down exactly on the right groin . If it had come down an inch or two to the left , the doctor said , the bladder would have been ruptured . As it is , the violent blow was received by the big thigh muscle , which would be paralyzed for a few days , but would gradually recover tone and be as good as ever . I-Iam can stand , putting weight on the leg , but can not lift it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backward , dragging it . So at present that is his method of locomotion . I can stand only so much of that world made up of the horses , 155Michael , the boys , the noise and violence  --  like a big dust cloud just off there near me  --  then I have to find a retreat . I take long rides alone with Pom and Rachel . I think of Music . I think of Reese . Reese has always been caught into the same things that take possession of me . When I was seven and he was nine , he would hear me playing those deep fifths and come running and sit on the bench beside me . We would look into each other 's eyes and listen and wonder while the whole afternoon passed . We were knocking on a door  --  where did it lead ? This has not changed . When , after ten years of absence in Los Angeles , I returned to New York , I met him first at a dinner party . There was talk of some south African rhythms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table , " Did you by any chance , a few years ago , see a moving-picture travelogue in which there was a tribe of savages moving through the jungle , singing a war chant ? " Reese exclaimed , " I did indeed ! " In unison , we broke into that strange and disturbing chant . There was something else that we would do when we were children . I would play a simple piece as it is written . Then Reese would cry , " Now play it big ! " And , as I had done with the little teaching piece When the Wind Blows , I would cut loose , play it with all my fingers , with all my passion  --  as big as I could . Then there was the Wind Harp . I composed this years ago when we had not been long at the ranch . I was lying up there one day on the top of the world lost in the skies and the wilderness and I apprehended wind moving all around me . I could hear it singing and yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not a cloud . And I thought , But it is a harp  --  this place ! And I imagined the bank of filamentsslanting down across the world . And shoulders of wind like immense angel 's wings thrusting , making this faint twanging , this sighing  --  a sound so full of beauty , so full of doom  --  so potent to lift you and yet crush you , cradle you and drink all your tearsTwo long melodic lines came to me for that piece and when156they did I suffered a sort of shock . I could hardly move or speak for several days . I felt the ecstatic quality . Well , what is ecstasy ? It is the thirst and the drink together ; and how put that into music ? Simultaneously it flowed out and drew in . I looked up wind harp in the encyclopedia and found under the long dissertation these beautiful lines : " It is said that King David had a wind harp suspended over his couch ; and in the long watches of the night it would sound with ravishing harmonieswhen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one morning early in Reese 's apartment when suddenly I heard a shout and the thud of his feet as he leaped out of the shower . He and a bath towel arrived at the door of the drawing room . " Play that again ! Again ! Do it again ! Do n't stop ! Go right on ! " How long did I keep playing it ? He would n't let me stop . For Vernon Spencer perhaps even more than for Reese , this piece had deep significance . He seemed stunned by it . He read it again and again , slowly , pausing now and then to drop his hands in his lap and stare at the music , in deep thought . " How ever did you get those two melodies ? " He played them slowly , one note at a time , dropped his hands in his lap again and thought again . Finally he turned to look at me with brows drawn down . " It 's love ! " He exclaimed this suddenly as if surprised . " It 's just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This I had not known or particularly intended , but why not ? Have I not been in love with love all my life ? ( " All but love , " wrote the French author , Francois Mauriac , " is torment . " ) And all that is symbolic of love . Of all flowers , roses . Of all colors , pink . Of all musical intervals , the major third . Goetschius speaks of this interval  --  its piercing sweetness ; and says , " Use it sparingly . " Yes , yes , always use love sparingly . " The fierce joy of loving too much , it is a terrible thing , " wrote James Barrie . Spencer forgot my piece , sat with hands in his lap , fingers curled inward a little , staring past me out the glass wall of the room . Cruelly sharp-edged hills stared back at him . " I sit here , " he said in an odd , strangled voice , " day after157day , week after week , year after year , working like a gopher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many gophers . He went on in the same estranged way . " There is a verse by Dowson . " He recited it : " They are not long , the weeping and the laughter , Love and desire and hate : I think they have no portion in us afterWe pass the gate . " They are not long , the days of wine and roses : Out of a misty dreamOur path emerges for a while , then closes Within a dream . " He took off his glasses , shook his head suddenly and with the heel of his hand wiped the tears from his cheek . " I 'm sorry . Those lines always make me cry . " He stood up , went to the end of the room and threw logs on the fire . The doorbell rang . That meant the next pupil was there . He paid no attention but pointed to the sofa . " Sit down . I 'd like to talk to you a little . " Words poured forth . A torrent . He told me his life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rang again and another pupil arrived . They accumulated in the anteroom . At five he dismissed them all . I was wrung out . I slowly rose from the sofa . With his customarybright smile he patted my cheek . " You do n't mind , do you ? Some other day we 'll go on with your piece . Today it broke me up . I just felt I had to tell you everything . " What has stayed with me out of all that long tale is the picture of a little boy fourteen years old who stood in short trousers , long black woolen stockings held up by round red garters , pleading with his father . Since he had won the contest and had been appointed to be the organist of the church , could he not please have a pair of long trousers ? When Wind Harp reached Sam Fox in New York and he sat listening to the record ( Spencer had had one of his finest158pianists play and record it ) he too sat staring out the window , and said , " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because , he said , people would like to hear those two long melodies . The Dutch piano virtuoso who had played Twilight and Birdcallsplayed Wind Harp too . And when I asked the friend who had brought this about , " Oh ! He liked it ? " " He loved it . He said he found it very moving . And not at all easy . Because of the two rhythms . The going and coming to-gether . " Now they have left for Frontier.
