WILSON , JAMES GOLDBERG.ALBERT SZENT-GYORGYI.ROBERT Letters to The Times For Spanish Literacy Test English-Language Requirement Is Held Unfair to Puerto Ricans To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Almost every major newspaper in - New York City has recently printed an editorial on the question of whether Puerto Ricans , native-born United States citizens , should be allowed to qualify as voters through a literacy test in Spanish . Your editorial of Aug. 1 , unlike most Times editorials , does not seem to have thought out the real issue. : You make it sound as if the law were something sacrosanct to ' be hallowed just because it exists and not a requirement necessary for the fullest and broadest enjoyment of citizenship . We do n't think anyone quarrels with the right of a state to require that its voters be well informed . But we do n't think anyone could be blind to the obvious opportunities for such a law also to become a gimmick to disfranchise in one way . or another . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( informed voters ) Is satisfied , should not all then/be done to facilitate the citizen 's right to exercise his franchise ? We are sure you know that Puerto Ricans here are more than adequately informed through Spanishlanguage daily newspapers and radio stations . This is the essence as to the rightness or wrongness of being allowed to live as a first-class citizen , but it is n't all . The literacy test in English inhibits , and thus disfranchises , thousands of Puerto Ricans who could pass the test but who are afraid to take it because they have been made to feel that they will fail and that therefore it is better not to waste time or risk shame or embarrassment . Was this the law 's intent ? Difficult to Master The editorial statement that it 's not asking much that a voter learn enough English in his first year is manifestly unfair in the case of the Puerto Rican citizen . English , a difficult language to assimilate as any linguist will testify , is not learned in a day . Continued communication in Spanish helps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political change " escapes me . Is n't it just as political to suggest " take your citizenship rights later rather than sooner " ? New York is not in the majority on this issue . It stands with Alabama , Mississippi and only 15 other Southern and Western states in requiring literacy tests in English only . We are proud that Puerto Rico does not require a literacy test in Spanish . We are proud that Puerto Rico has been called " democracy 's showcase in the Caribbean . " But we will be prouder still when we can exercise our rights as nativeborn citizens throughout this land . Perhaps our country will then be known as " democracy 's showcase in the hemisphere . " JOSEPH MON SERRAT , Director , Department of Labor , Migration Division , Commonwealth of Puerto Rico . New York , Aug. 6 , 1963 . Toward Halting Dropouts TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : It was heartening to read ( Aug. 3 ) about President Kennedy 's allocation of $250,000 for an attack on problems of school dropouts . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will go to the big city high schools , with nothing for the elementary schools . The taproot of the dropout problem , it seems to me , reaches down into the elementary school , way down to the first grade . ' It is in these early years that a student 's basic attitude toward school work and school life is formed . A student with little intellectual ability , who lives in a socio-economically deprived area and who encounters mostly frustration and academic failure through the first eight grades , can hardly be expected to enter secondary school with any enthusiasm or determination . Hopefully someone will spend some money studying , not only the academically sick and dying in high school , but also those in elementary schools who are manifesting the first rash of discontent , the first fever of maladjustment . EUGENE S. WILSON , Dean of Admission , Amherst College . Amherst , Mass. , Aug. 5 , 1963 . Foreign Aid Opposed TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : It is necessary for the United States to be practical regarding foreign aid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assistance refuse to supporc the United States , despite the fact that they have been given aid by us . Our Government should adopt policy of " Support the United States in world affairs , then we shall give you assistance . " If underdeveloped countries do not wish to accept such an offer , then I am certain that our Government can use the money that would have been appropriated for foreign aid to help needy people here . Let 's stop this idiotic sentimentalism in foreign aid . JAMES GOLDBERG . Flushing , L. I. , Aug. 4 , 1963 . Test-Ban Treaty Backed Nobel Laureate-Views the Pact as Possible Turning . Point To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The complex technical problems connected with the test-ban treaty are of utmost ' importance and deserve the most careful consideration . However , we should not lose sight of the basic issue , which is this : modern science , born at the turn of this century , has made man the master of superhuman forces and speeds . We are only at the very beginning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the quantum theory that the first atomic bomb was detonated . ' The second destroyed a whole city . In this reaction , as in all present nuclear reactions , but a very small fraction of the energy residing in matter was released . Once we learn how to release the whole energy , we may be able to blow up our whole globe with a handful of matter . The march of science can not be stopped , and so man has to decide whether to use these forces for the elevation of his existence or else destroy himself . The forces released by science are incompatible with the present political and economic structures , thinking and relations . The only alternative to our extinction is the establishment of new and better human relations and supranational structures . The test-ban treaty may be the first step in this direction , a turning point in our history . Its rejection by the Senate would take us a big step toward catastrophe , while its half-hearted acceptance would jeopardize our moral leadership . ALBERT SZENT-GYORGur . Woods Hole , Mass. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIM ES : ? In a recent article in The Times Arthur Krock mentioned that the civil rights bill might find surer legal ground in the 13th Amendment than in the power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce . It is interesting to recall in view of this opinion , expressed also by others in current discussion of the bill , that Charles Sumner , in debate on the 1866 Civil Rights Bill , believed the 13th Amendment granted Congress all the power necessary to guarantee full equality before the law . Because of this belief , too , he felt the 14th Amendment unnecessary at the time of its consideration in Congress . He is also the one who in 1849 argued before the Supreme Court of Massachusetts the unconstitutionality of separate Negro schools . Re argued-105 years before the Supreme Court decision of 1954 ? that separate schools , even if providing the same facilities as others , were not equal simply because they were separate . Perhaps we are at long last " catching up " with the Senator . ROBERT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Church . Wheeling , W. Va. , July 31 , 1963 . One Way to Settle Strikes To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Those who maintain that both unions and management groups are too full of drastic solutions to today 's labor problems , and feel that both sides should show more restraint , may be interested in this : " A. miners ' strike in 1496 was settled by arbitration with an agreement to behead ten of the union leaders and three company officials " ( from Life 's Picture History of Western Man ) . Who says we do n't live in a conservative age ? WILLIAM B. HOFF . St. James , L. I. , July 28 , 1963 . Rescue of Trees Hailed TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : More power to those residents of Westchester in their fight to save their trees ! Three cheers and a tiger for Governor Rockefeller 's intervention ! I hate and despise on principle a " progress " that hews down noble trees and kills or drives away beautiful birds in order to build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live " things natural , wild and free . " RUTH A. ELLIOTT . Meadville , Pa. , Aug. 1 , 1963.
