The known and unknown perils of space stayed their hand last week as the U.S. shot a second man into space with almost clockwork success . What made the second flight less successful than the first - and nearly cost Astronaut Virgil ( " Gus " ) Grissom his life-was the same primitive danger that threatened the skin-covered boats of neolithic man : the hostile and brooding sea . <P> In space , the Mercury capsule that bore Grissom 118 miles above the earth was a functioning-if not always perfect-vehicle ; in the salt water of the Atlantic , it became as vulnerable as a paper boat in a storm . The difference spelled a near disaster that taught the U.S. space program some valuable lessons , and may cause a third astronaut to be flung aloft before the program can proceed with its plan to put a man into orbit . <P> Before his ordeal , Astronaut Grissom went twice through the tedious preparations for flight , .. sealed each time into the Mercury capsule Liberty Bell 7 on the nose of the Redstone rocket . Twice the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoil the photographic record of the flight . Air Force Captain Grissom , 35 , took it all in stride . " I 'll be ready when you are , " he told officials as he stretched his limbs after hours of fruitless waiting in the cramped capsule . <P> Not a Philosopher . Gus Grissom 's almost stoic calm in the face of the unknown was the product of both an introspective nature and a long and dedicated apprenticeship . The smallest ( 5 ft. 7 in. ) , most soft-spoken and most reserved of the astronauts , he tried the Air Force briefly as an aviation cadet just before World War II ended , later re-entered it after getting a mechanical engineering degree at Purdue . He flew 100 combat missions in the Korean war ( Distinguished Flying Cross , two Air Medals ) , returned to the U.S. as a pilot instructor at Bryan , Texas . Says his pretty wife , Betty ( they have two boys ) : " He told me Korea was safer than teaching cadets how to fly . He said flying was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has flown more than 3,000 hours , 2,000 of them in jets . Chosen as one of the seven astronauts in 1959 , he went about his tasks quietly and efficiently , was almost unnoticed as he backstopped the more ebullient Commander Alan Shepard during the first shot . His specialty : control of the space capsule 's , attitude system . After he was picked as an astronaut , he admitted that he sometimes lay in bed thinking : " Now what in the hell do I want to get up in that thing for ? " He had his own answer . " I 'm a test pilot , " he said , " not a philosopher . I 'm too busy to worry . This is a day-to-day job for me . " Just before he climbed into his space capsule for the second time last week , a reporter cracked : " See you in a couple of days . " Replied Grissom : " Yeah . I 'll see you in a couple of days-or never . "         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
