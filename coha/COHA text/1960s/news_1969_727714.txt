txt The General Accounting Office , after a 14-month study ordered by Congress , has found that the Government 's drive against poverty , begun in 1964 , has been poorly administered and that some of its programs have fallen far short of their goals . A report of the findings , made public today , was particularly harsh on the Job Corps , which provides residential training centers for poor youths . It said corps trainees did little if any better in the labor market than poor youths without such training . The community action program , the heart of the drive against poverty , achieved its goal , the study showed , of being an effective advocate of the poor " in lesser measure than was reasonable to expect in relation to the magnitude of the funds expended . " However , the General Accounting Office found that over-all the antipoverty programs had sueipecled in varying degrees and that perfection could not be expected in view of the nature of the task and the haste with which the programs had been set up . Asks O.E.O. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which administers the programs , be continued as an independent agency with responsibility for community action and " certain other closely related programs . " It called for the creation of a new office in the White House to take over planning and coordination of all Federal antipoverty efforts . This is a function prescribed by law for the Office of Economic Opportunity but one the harassed agency has never gotten around to performing . At the agency , there was relief that the report did not charge widespread malfeasance and involvement of political revolutionaries in the programs . Bertrand M. Harding , the director , said : " We are gratified by the over-all support of the find // ings . Many of the shortcomings are problems that O.E.O. has recognized and is in the process of correcting . " Included in the report is a reply from the agency , based on a reading of the summary , of the findings . Clearly hurt by the charges , the office said it should share some credit for the fact that the number of people in poverty had declined persons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 22 million in 1968 . Credits Specific Programs " We agree that economic expansion has played a big part in this reduction , " it said. , " However , the rate of economic growth has not accelerated sufficiently to account for the fact that since the inception of O.E.O. , Americans have come out of poverty at a rate 2Y2 *'n es faster than ever before . " trhe General Accounting Office , headed by the . Controller General of the United States , , is an arm of Congress and gen- , erally performs an auditing function . In 1967 , Congress ordered it to make a thorough study of the antipoverty programs begun in 1964 and to make a judgment as to both their efficiency and success in helping the poor to surmount poverty . For the study , the office engaged the services of a group of outside experts , including social scientists , economists and other specialists . Parallel by Nixon Its recommendations conform rather well with those made recently by President Nixon . The President said that the Office of Economic Opportunity should be continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Department of Labor , where it would likely be reduced , and the Head Start educational program for preschool children to the Department of Health , Education and Welfare . A fight , however , is shaping up in Congress over both the disposition and the extent of the antipoverty effort , which has been a subject of controversy almost since its inception . Representative Carl D. Perkins , Democrat of Kentucky , who is chairman of the House Committee on Education and Labor , has promised to expand the drive and leave all the programs with the Office of Economic Opportunity . The authors of the study acknowledged that evaluating the agency 's progress was a complex and difficult job and that in some instances no objective conclusion could be reached . But as to the Job Corps , for example , the findings were devastating . Financing for the Job Corps from its beginning totaled about 61-billion . Training is provided for about 100,000 youths a year in rural and urban centers . The Office of Economic Opportunity has vigorously defended the program against repeated attacks both in and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study it conducted of the corps showed it had achieved " only limited success " in its primary success of equipping trainees for work and social responsibilities .
