Coming from the staid First National Bank of Denver , the biggest bank in the six-state Rocky Mountain region ( assets : $530 million ) , last month 's outburst was an eyebrow raiser . Calling the first press conference in the bank 's 108-year history , President Eugene H. Adams declared that " We are very mad about this situation . " Next day First National further vented its anger by placing full-page newspaper ads to denounce what it described as a " blatant , selfish attempt of a part-time Coloradan turned New York Wall Street raider to take over . " <P> Object of the unbankerly attack was a 29-year-old , Yale-educated multimillionaire named William Mathews White Jr. , a bachelor who tools around Denver in a fire-engine red International Scout , acts on the belief that " the only people who are ever heard are those who stand above the crowd and shout . " <P> A vice president of Manhattan 's Allen &; Co. investment banking firm , White made himself heard back home in Denver in 1964 by parlaying $100,000 of his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He then shook up Denver 's old guard with some financial wizardry that enabled him to take over the venerable Great Western Sugar Co . He has since merged his two companies into the Great Western United Corp. , a diversified $259 million-a-year food products firm , of which he is both chairman and president . <P> Disruptive Influence . The young entrepreneur 's differences with the First National stem from the fact that both his grandfather and father were directors and prime movers of the bank . When William White Sr. died in 1966 , First National pointedly passed over his two sons in filling the vacant directorship , even though the White family held a major interest in the bank . <P> Determined to remedy that oversight , Bill White became embroiled with First National after it decided to form a holding company , a step that two rival Denver banks had already taken as a way of circumventing a Colorado law prohibiting branch banking . When the Whites suggested last month that five family-owned banks in southern Colorado be included in the holding company , called the First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the request only after the new company went into operation . <P> That was not soon enough for the Whites . Pointing to its 24% stock holding , the family demanded " pro rata representation , " presumably meaning at least six seats , on the bank 's 25-member board . First National countered by offering the family two seats , specified that both be filled by family representatives other than Bill White . " Young Bill is a very smart man , " explains First National Chairman Montgomery Dorsey , 67 . " But he does n't have the maturity of judgment or outlook to go with his brilliance . " Adds Adams : " We feel that he would be a disruptive influence on the board . "
