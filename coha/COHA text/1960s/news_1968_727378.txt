txt As the bill to establish the North Cascades National Park in the State of Washington nears final Presidential approval , a dream that began more than sixty years ago is about to become a reality . It was in 1906 that conservationists in the Northwest first suggested that this magnificent region of mountains , glaciers , meadows , rivers and lakes , sometimes called America 's Alps , should become a national park . The proposal was renewed from time to time without success . In 1937 , a special study team reported to the Department of the Interior that a national park in the North Cascades would " outrank in its scenic , recreational and wildlife values any existing national park and any other possibility for such a park in the United States . " The timber and mining interests , however , have always blocked the way . The area is rich in minerals and has valuable forests of fir and cedar . But now at last a park bill has cleared Congress due largely to the skillful leadership of Senator Henry Jackson of Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happens when an issue is bitterly controversial , it required a compromise to break the stalemate over the park , and the final bill , although excellent in many ways , is less than ideal . It would have been desirable , for example , to transfer the Glacier Peak-Image Lake region out of the existing Glacier Peak Wilderness Area administered by the Forest Service and into the new park . This is the region where the Kennecott Copper Corporation is planning to develop an open-pit mine and is also actively prospecting in the hope of filing additional mining claims . To permit the building of access roads to this mine and to permit pollution from mine wastes would be a desecration . But the Senate decided that to fight this Kennecott copper issue now would reopen the compromise on mining claims arrived at in the Wilderness Act four years ago and would seriously jeopardize the prospects of this bill in the House . Such is the power of a mining corporation . Another compromise involved Mt .. Baker and its environs . This area should unquestionably have been included in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visitors the complete story of the geology of the Cascade range . But the Mt . Baker region is richly forested , and the national Forest Service , which now controls it and which has resisted a national park for decades , made exclusion of ML Baker virtually its price for accepting the bilL Such is the power of the Forest Service . The Georgia-Pacific Corporation , the nation 's second largest lumber company , which we have already had occasion to criticize severely for its selfish resistance to a Redwoods National Park , appears again in opposition to the public interest in the North Cascades . The company 's current operations are hardly affected , but it sees the park as a threat to its hopes of future forest exploitation not only near Mt . Baker but also into the heart of the Glacier Peak Wilderness . Despite this corporate and bureaucratic resistance , both houses have now approved the park bill and it will become law once President Johnson signs it . In conserving a great portion of this superb wilderness unspoiled forever , the Ninetieth Congress has performed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
