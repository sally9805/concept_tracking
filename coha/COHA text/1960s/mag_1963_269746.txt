In front of a pale green building on Honolulu 's Kapiolani Boulevard one day last week , a band of ukuleles and a bass fiddle plunked out a rhythmic island tune . In the midday sun , languid , aloha-shirted islanders meandered back and forth along the sidewalk carrying their signs , pausing now and then for a swig of pineapple juice or to chat with a passerby . The occasion was neither a luau nor a festival , but the visible evidence of the first strike in more than 100 years of Hawaiian newspaper publishing history . <P> In its third week , the seven-union walkout led by the Newspaper Guild against the morning Advertiser and afternoon Star-Bulletin , Hawaii 's only two island-wide dailies , has become a contest of wills between hardheaded Financier Chinn Ho , who dominates both papers , and Jack Hall , the tough boss of militant unionism in the islands . At first the unions wanted an across-the-board pay raise of $10 a week . The publishers offered a sliding scale downward from $3.50 . The gap narrowed to the point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negotiations broke down , and the strike was on . Ho , the Oriental bank messenger who became a millionaire in real estate , said that management had not even had time to present its final offer . <P> There were obviously issues that never got to the bargaining table . Mainland-born Hall , who sailed to Hawaii in 1935 , teamed up with West Coast Labor Boss Harry Bridges and now presides over a diminishing domain of plantation and dock workers , has been looking for a way to organize Hawaii 's white-collar workers . With a small unit of his own union controlling some circulation-department workers and with the Guild seeking his counsel , Hall urged the Advertiser and Star-Bulletin employees to strike , and told them how to do it . Last week Hall spelled out his purpose frankly . The strike , he said , " will give the impetus to organization of many more white-collar workers here . " <P> Charging that this kind of talk proves that the motive for the strike has little to do with dollars and cents , Ho said he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But at week 's end Realist Ho was back at the bargaining table with the unions just in case a quick settlement was possible .
