VISIONS OF GERARD by Jack Kerouac. 151 pages . Farrar , Straus. $3.95 . <P> <P> It is hard these days to evoke childhood 's lost garden of innocence when current fiction insists that there is no such thing and that the very young are very wicked , with tendencies to parricide and cannibalism . Thus it is both a pleasant and surprising experience to read Jack Kerouac 's Visions of Gerard , which asserts the faith that a child has a better chance of being good than someone older who is already visited by corruption . Perhaps only someone known as a high-bellowing beatnik prose man , and thus a bit of a child himself , could have pulled off the unlikely feat of extorting tears for a dead child . The child is Gerard , doomed to sanctity in a New England tribe of boozing , brawling Canucks . He dies at nine , a neighborhood wonder , full of love for God , small animals and his mother . Kerouac 's feeling is genuine , and the self-indulgent gush of his prose is perhaps no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deal with real , grown-up saints .
