The grey haze of industry billowed up from Guatemala City on the valley floor below , andthe impatient tootling of traffic jams sounded far into the hills . " I remember when there were just two cars in Guatemala-both Packards , " said Lee Whitbeck , 82 , a U.S.-born dairyman who went to Guatemala in 1916 and now operates a farm outside the capital . " They used to drive down those cobblestone streets all alone . " Nowadays , Whitbeck never goes into town unless he has to . " You ca n't find a place to park , " he grumbles . <P> Nineteen months after the ouster of President Miguel Ydgoras Fuentes and the establishment of military rule , Central America 's biggest capital is also its busiest . The streets are choked with autos-Mercedes-Benzes , Peugeots , Volkswagens . Ford Falcons . <P> Sidewalks are filled with bundle-laden shoppers , and store windows beckon with imported washers , steam irons , refrigerators and TV sets . Outside town , barefoot peasants pad along the dusty roads with $40 Sony transistor radios slung over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one merchant , " but that 's what people are paying . " New Experience . Prosperity is a new experience for Guatemala , which scraped along for years in the banana-republic image-without industry , unable to import what it wanted , or even pay for what it did buy . During the regime of cantankerous old Ydgoras , graft and inefficiency , those standard Central American ills , cut the country 's dollar reserves from $72 million in 1957 to $28 million in 1962 . The foreign investors who might have helped stayed away-which was hardly surprising , with student riots in Guatemala City and grumbling peasants in the countryside . Then , in mid-1963 , Juan Jos Arevlo , 60 , Guatemala 's Communist-coddling onetime President ( 1945-51 ) and Yanqui baiter ( The Shark and the Sardines ) , was allowed to return to stand for election . That was the final straw . <P> The military sacked Ydgoras . Into his place went Army Colonel Enrique Peralta Azurdia , 56 , an austere career officer nicknamed " el Buddha . " So far he has proved a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's businessmen , asked them what to do , and took their advice . He promoted new trade agreements with his neighbors , offered low-cost credit to farmers , expanded cotton production on Guatemala 's rich Pacific slope . " That land is so rich in nitrogen , " says one cotton grower , " that you could sack it and sell it for fertilizer . " This year 's income from Guatemala 's major crops-coffee , cotton and bananas-should reach $134 million , 35% more than 1962.
