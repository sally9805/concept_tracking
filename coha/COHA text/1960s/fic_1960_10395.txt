protesting at once both ignorance and innocence . The magnitude and extent of the countryside itself amazed us once we had left the crowded confines of New York . Even the relative compactness of New England , when contrastedwith western states unknown to us , seemed inconceivablyvast and various to our alien eyes . The bright , sharply defined landscape constantly changed like some kaleidoscope . White villages slipped by , their houses made of wood instead of brick or plaster ; white churches with steeples and gilded weather vanes ; generous red or white barns , sometimes oddly attached to the houses by other white buildings , sometimes standing by themselves . We looked in vain for thatch . " Do you think we shall have a barn in Pepperell ? " Ansie asked . " I hope it will be red . " " Very likely , " my father said . " Everyone here seems to have a barn . " He sat staring out the dirty window , which he had discoveredto his discomfiture could not be raised or lowered by a strap . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been looking forward to a rare orange in the toe of his Christmas stocking and , instead , has been overwhelmed by possessions unexpected and innumerable . Occasionally he reluctantly interrupted his gazing to consult a thick paper folder which named the cities and towns through which we were to pass . " Does this train stop at a place called Concord ? " he inquired of the burly , blue-clad conductor , who punched our long tickets . " Which Concord ? " the conductor asked . " There 's one in Massachusetts , and there 's another in New Hampshire . " " The one nearer Boston , " my father said . " They 're neither of them on this run , " the conductor said . He was clearly worried over us all . " You have n't made a mistake , have you ? You wo n't planning to go to Concord ? "  | " No , " my father said . " At least not now . It 's only that I have a friend who once lived there . " We went past fields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given to garden produce , tall stalks of corn , harvested grain , a thousand fields beneath the blazing early September sun . No familiar hedges separated one from another , but , instead , fences of grey , interlocking logs or walls of piled grey stones . Sometimes brilliant red berries flamed against the stones . Now and then in a thicket a tree or a bush was crimson . The whole land , fields and thickets , valleys and hillsides , even the hollows beside the railroad tracks , were bordered or filled by the brilliant yellow plumes of some plant strange to us . Ansie 's curiosity over all this prodigal splendour could not be curbed . " Could you tell me what the yellow flowers are ? " he asked a boy on one of his many trips to the water tank at the end of the car . " Goldenrod , " the boy said . " Ai n't you ever seen goldenrodbefore ? It 's all over the place , come fall . " " It 's goldenrod , " Ansie said proudly , returning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michaelmas daisies , they call asters here . What 's fall , father ? " " Fall ? " asked my father . " Fall ? Oh , I remember now . It 's autumn . It 's the American word for autumn . It means the falling of the year . " More falls of a different sort , falls of tumultuous water sliding over high dams by busy mills and factories . Waterfalls in the wide courses of rivers , which we thundered across on bridges or followed for miles past woods and farmlands . Tiny falls and swirling eddies in countless swift streams . " American rivers are not much like the Little Ouse or the Stour , " Mary said . Or the Lark , I thought , slipping beneath the abbot 's ancient bridge , the drooping willows , and thep112limes at Bury . " Many of these rivers have beautiful names , " my father said . " Remember how we read about them in the encyclopedia ? Piscataqua , Androscoggin , Penobscot , and Kennebec ? I wish now I had found out their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can learn those presently . Thoreau visited the Penobscot River about fifty years ago . He tells all about it in a book called The Maine Woods . " Pastures with rough outcroppings of ledges and grey boulders , pastures which seemed always to be climbing hills and then losing themselves in the transparent distance of the clear hot sky . Cattle edging their way among the rocks , staring stupidly at the train , or galloping off in panic at our uproar and our billowing smoke . " There do n't seem to be many sheep in New England , " my father said . Forests of dark trees , pines and firs and larches , and others strange to us . At times we hurtled through miles of such forests , thin white birches on their borders , a thick tangle of interlacing green beyond . " It 's easy to see why most houses in this country are made of wood , " my mother said . Numberless lakes and smaller ponds , reflecting the blue of the sky , sparkling beneath the sun . Small boats with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the western light , their oars dipping in the cool water . On the short coastline of New Hampshire , suddenly the sea with low islands far in the distance . " The Isles of Shoals , " the conductor said . " I ca n't imagine anything shoal in this country , " my mother said , wiping the soot and dust for the hundredth time from her streaming face . " What 's shoal ? " Ansie asked  | " Shallow , " my mother said . Again the sea in Maine , waves rolling in to burst in white surf on long sandy beaches , the sails of ships against a far horizon , a white lighthouse on a rocky promontory . Miles of marshes with green and yellow grasses and thick reeds with sharp tops like spikes of brown felt . Tidal inlets making their way over pale , wrinkled mud , which was set with thousands of tiny blue and white shells . Hundreds of sea gulls , swooping in great circles through the air , resting on their wide grey wings , perching on poles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slime and shallow water in search of food . " The fens in the old days must have been much like these marshes , " my father said . Wider rivers , larger lakes , more white villages , fewer towns and cities , higher , rockier pastures , more small rushing streams , longer stretches of woodland . And always , until the night fell , the illimitable height and width of the sky , blue , cloudless , shimmering , looking even from the grimy windows of our coach as though it were boundless , far beyond the reach of human eyes , so vast that beneath it one felt unprotectedand alone . When in the darkness we changed trains for the last lap of our journey , this immensity of our new sky smote yet more intensely upon us . The sharp circumference , the unimpededoutlines of the moon , the brilliance of the constellations , the infinite number of the stars made us , as we gazed upward through the now cold air , incredulous , stunned . Here no low-hung clouds , no wandering wraiths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earth or set the few visible stars almost on the tops of church towers or glittering among the very branches of the trees.  |p114No  foreigner coming to our shores , provided that his tastes are rural rather than urban , ever forgets or , indeed , quite recovers from his first experience of an American autumn . Especially is this true of the English countryman in whom is bred from infancy a passion for the land , for open air , interminable walks , a close and profound association with meadows and streams , animal life , trees , clouds , mist , rain , and soft sunlight . Autumn in England is lovely , to be sure  --  the green of summer , less vivid but lingering ; the pale yellow of beeches and elms ; the bronze of oaks ; days likely to be windless ; early twilights shadowy and still . Yet there the colouring , for the most part , is subdued and sombre : pale blues and greys of close skies , the fading brown of the hay ricks , the tans of cropped downs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stubble fields . There is no blazonry on English hills ; no ranks of trees in massed scarlet , gold , orange , and purple ; no long succession of brilliant , diaphanous days ; no New Jerusalem on every mean roadside . Pepperell in September and throughout October overwhelmedus all . Its almost perfect half-moon of a harbour was enclosed by two high points of land , heavily wooded above their red cliffs with fir and spruce ; but this growth was so interspersed with birch and beech trees that its darkness was fired by tongues of yellow flame . The rough fields above the rocky shore were tangled with red sumac and dense clusters of goldenrod , which glowed more brightly after the early light frosts . Behind the white houses along the main country road tumbled the pastures , purple , rose , and scarlet from great patches of blueberry , rising northward toward the hills which were clothed in like pageantry . In every marshy hollow the swamp maples were crimson ; over every stone wall thep115red woodbine clambered ; vast flocks of golden-winged birds hovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their orange berries . The constant sun irradiated all , bathing the land with light , gleaming upon the full tide , heightening colours , lengthening shadows , silvering the wings of the gulls . As October ripened and waned , the sparkling air was filled with drifting leaves which , rustling downward , lay in roadsidehollows and upon village lawns like open mines of gold and jewels . In the early evening after their work men raked these into piles for burning ; and as the blue smoke curled upward and the piles were turned and scattered , the frail golden threads of ribs and stems glowed for a brief instant before they were consumed . Autumn here in this new land had its sounds as well as its colours , sounds accentuated by the stillness and thinness of the atmosphere . The resonant trill and hum of millions of unseen insects filled the air by night as well as by day , not plaintive and intermittent like that of the hedge crickets at home , but shrill , high , buoyant , continuous . It was easy when walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from boughs and twigs to float downward . Migrating birds in countless thousands flew overhead at dawn , twittering and crying , or , pausing for a brief space on their flight southward , chirped or sang all day as they foraged and scratched among the roadside growths . The calling of the gulls was clamorous ; and the crazy laughter of the loons was repeated in high , tremulous echoes . Even the heavy , muffled sounds of labour , the thudding of mallets , the thumping of boards , the rattling of chains became more thin and clear as they resounded shoreward from the piers and slips where men worked at building small fishing or pleasure craft or from the open harbour when the fishing boats dropped their anchors.  |p116My  father in all this radiance of colour , this harmony of sound , now moved from strength to strength like those highheartedpilgrims in the Psalm . Whatever unexpressed misgivingsmay have puzzled and tormented him as we crossed the Atlantic faded into nothingness . Hope rose again within him , strong and unassailable , that larger , all-encompassing hope inclusive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manhood had shaped his thoughts and determined his manner of life became again steadfast and unshaken . Men were at heart again generous and kind , aware of their parts in the drama of existence , able and eager to play them nobly and well . Humanity moved ever onward , out of evil into good , out of ignorance and indifference toward wisdom and desire , sensible , however dimly , of the purposes of God . Without humanity thus created and endowedby I Tim , God could have no meaning , perhaps even no Being . All these thoughts , flooding his mind like a returning tide , seemed in this new freedom , under this high , limitless sky and among these bright hills , more invulnerable than they had ever been ; and my mother , seeing him again both resilient and sure , confident , expectant , and content , looked herself more serene and happy than she had looked since we left Saintsbury , though I felt certain that she was more homesick than any of us for the old ways of England . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps more accurately the village of Pepperell , Maine , satisfied and reassured my father from the beginning of our sojourn . He felt secure and at home among men who laboured with their hands , believing as he did with the Apocryphal philosopher and poet that they , in truth , upheld " the fabric of the world . " His impatient ardour to learn everything at oncep117about his new environment amounted almost to voracity . He even seemed , to my mother 's amusement , to be abandoning at least for the time being his Suffolk slowness and deliberation . He spent hours upon the small docks and wharves , asking eager questions about the building of boats , lending a hand at ordinary tasks . The intricate mysteries of weir-setting excitedhim as did the simpler framing of lobster traps and the constant mending of nets , spread out to dry upon the beach in the sun or on the grassy slopes above . He acquaintedhimself as well with the upland farming carried on not too prosperously above a rugged coastline given over largely to the various pursuits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked miles in order to discover a few on some distant hills . As to a lambing meadow , no one among either farmers or fishermen had ever so much as heard of such a phenomenon , which he took vast pleasure in describing to them . He was almost equally engrossed in lesser matters : Mary 's entrance into the academy , which was a red-brick buildingwith a white-columned porch on a high hill above the harbour ; Ansie 's and mine into the grammar school , a battered wooden structure far less pretentious than the academy , on the country road a mile beyond the village centre ; Ansie 's new lore of baseball , and of football scrimmages , kicks , and passes . After tea , which we enjoyed a bit surreptitiously since it did not seem to be the general custom of the country , and before supper , Ansie initiated him into the batting of tosses in the field behind our house , both of them laughingat his good-humoured awkwardness , his almost complete ineptitude . The differences in the uses of words amused and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days at school and sprang them upon him and my mother at meals.  | " A boy at school ate too many crabapples and was terribly sick to his stomach , " Ansie said . My mother looked horrified . " Ansie ! " she said . " Kindly watch your language . " " I am , " Ansie said . " They do n't say just sick here . They say to your stomach as well . Stomach is a good American word . I wish I could say it to Katie or the vicar , or best of all , to Grandfather Oldroyd . " " They say bug , too , " Mary contributed with a slight reminiscent shudder . " Bugs here are any insects at all , not just  --  you know what  --  as at home . " " Well , why not ? " my father said . " Very graphic , I 'm sure . " My mother looked unconvinced about the helpful vividnessof stomach and bug , both unmentionable in decent English circles ; but she added to our linguistic researches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy a spool of thread in a village shop because she had asked for a reel of cotton . " Incidentally , my dear , " my father said , " you do n't say shop here . Shops arc stores , just as cupboards are closets , and sweets are candy , and biscuits are crackers , and taps are faucets . " He looked so pleased with himself that we forbore to tell him that we had discovered all these differences weeks ago . Ansie got his red barn in Pepperell . It was not attached to the house as were several of our neighbours ' barns , but instead stood well beyond it to the right behind our driveway and in front of our field . It had a spacious opening between two great doors to receive racks laden with hay in July ,  |p119and  , higher up , a smaller door for the pitching and stacking of the hay in its loft above the lower floor . On this lower floor there was room for three stalls , a grain bin , and an open space for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide and relatively low , with a most agreeable roof slope . It looked snug and hospitable with its fresh red paint in honour of my father 's arrival . Ansie loved it at sight , and , indeed , we all felt fortunate in its possession . In material comforts we were clearly far better cared for than the families of most Maine country parsons . The barn and the parsonage itself had been bequeathed some ten years earlier to the church by a wifeless and childlessMethodist deacon or elder . We were never quite sure of his exact identity , though we were grateful heirs to his bounty . " Whatever do you call these sidesmen , or wardens , or clerks in this odd church of yours ? " my mother used to ask my father ; but in spite of her frequent irritation over Methodism in general , she shared our pleasure in our new establishment . The parsonage was white with green shutters  --  or blinds , as we learned to say . Its rooms were large and sunny , and its furnishings , also bequeathed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyesores like the Royal Family and Susannah Wesley . The Wesleys seemed , indeed , not to figure prominently in American Methodism , at least not in nomenclature . My father here in Pepperell was the Methodist minister , never the Wesleyan parson as at home . Our lands , too , were generous . Behind the house and barn was a large , open field , which extended toward an equally large pasture , which in turn gave place to ample acreage of woodland . The field and the pasture were ours to use as we liked . Within a fortnight my father had bought a cow , an amiable , docile creature apparently of mixed parentage , sincep120her dull-red sides , blotched liberally with white , marked no discernible inheritance . Her name was Lilla . At first we allowed her to roam in the field and feed well on the second growth of grass ; but once my father discovered that Maine fields were sacred to hay and that pastures were the scantier portion of Maine cows , he moved her . He was excited daily over this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His youth was returning , he said ; but it would never be wholly with him again until he had a few sheep cropping around the pasture rocks with Lilla . One of his parishioners , neither a deacon nor an elder , but merely the superintendent of the Sunday school , insisted on the loan of a horse since the nature of our parish in this land of vast distances demanded frequent drives into the outlying countryside . My father , overcome by such benevolencewhich , he said , exemplified all the Old Testament commands toward strangers together with half the New Testament parables , gladly welcomed an elderly yet adequatewhite mare named Snow White , complete with harness and a light carriage . With Lilla in one stall of our red barn and Snow White in another , he awaited only his sheep in our pasture for entire contentment . My mother sorely missed a garden . In Maine there seemed to be no enclosures either behind or at one side of the houses and given to flowers , shrubs , and privacy . Instead , there were only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A garden here meant a sizable plot of earth devoted to vegetables only and usually cut out from a field at close proximity to a house . Such was ours . We did have an orchard , however , which flanked our barn and nurtured a dozen hardy apple trees well laden with fruit . Ansie and I gathered the apples with great pride and stored them in barrels in our cool , dry cellar , also an innovation to us all.  |p121The  final bequest of the deacon or elder had been his housekeeper , who had not only cared for him during his declining years but for three Methodist preachers and their families preceding us . Her name was Mrs. Baxter . She was a permanent fixture of the parsonage , as much a part of it as a floor board , or the sitting-room fireplace , or its front door , or the invisible joists and timbers which framed it . She was not so much essential and necessary as she was inherent , intrinsic , and intact . She was a widow of late middle age , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very red cheeks , firm and smooth like Peggotty 's in David Copper field , discerning brown eyes , and steel-grey hair , so tautly drawn back from her forehead and ears into a tight pug at the exact centre of the back of her head that not one errant spear had any hope of escape or even momentary release . Her standards of exactnessand perfection seemed almost awful to my mother , after Katie 's easy , casual ways . Mrs. Baxter was by both conviction and inclination an enemy to anything casual . She was totally unable to understand those wholesome periods of indifference to mere detail which promise freedom and refreshment . Details were her sacraments . She yielded up her being with complete devotion to her spotless floors , her dustless tables and chairs , her folded , snowy sheets , her loaves of fragrant bread ; and only after she and they had experienced full communion was she fully satisfied . Inured as she had been for a decade to ministerial incumbentsand their families , she had grown both sharp and sagacious in her summing up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our collective demands upon her discernment were costly at the beginning of our life together . My fatherp122was quite beyond her ken so far as Methodist parsons were known to her . She was puzzled by his courtesy and his quiet , slow ways . His absorbing pleasure and curiosity in his new parish at first startled and then delighted her . She was unused to such enthusiasm , such hourly interest and enlivenment . She was unused also to his apparent freedom from those niggling domestic anxieties which she had thought inescapable in the life of any rural parson . The quality which astonished her most , however , was his utter lack of domination both over his family and toward all church matters . This singular respect for the thoughts of others , even for those of us children and for her own ( for he often came to her for information and advice ) , aroused at times uneasy speculations in her mind , first as to the manner of man he actually was and then as to whether or not he would be valued by his practical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allegiance to him and prepared the way for what finally became her almost fierce protectiveness . She was understandably chary toward my mother , cautious , perhaps at the start more than a little suspicious . The ministers ' wives whom she had known were sobered and burdenedby countless cares , borne nobly for the sake of their husbands . They had obviously expected no lives of their own . My mother 's cares rested lightly upon her , or at all events gave that impression ; she apparently had more life of her own than she could well manage and intended to preserve and enjoy it ; and her treatment of my father often included a flippancy outside the range of Mrs. Baxter 's imagination or of her former association with loyal Methodist helpmates . Nevertheless , although all her robust principles governing a woman 's responsibility to her husband and home were constantlyshattered by my mother , the fact that she was willing and eager to entrust Mrs. Baxter with the entire running ofp123the household was not without its compensations . She grew slowly used to my mother 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Each morning they held a colloquy , revealing to them both , in the kitchen : " What did you plan for supper , Mrs. Tillyard ? " " I did n't plan a thing . You always know . Do I need to plan ? " " Well , most women do around here . Perhaps they do n't in England . " " Oh , I 'm sure they do  --  that is , the really good ones . " " What I mean is , the other preachers ' wives always did . " " I 'm afraid I 'm an utter failure as a preacher 's wife , Mrs.Baxter , but possibly I might improve with time . " " I never said you was a failure . I only asked about supper . " " What is there at hand ? " " Well , there 's baked beans to warm over , and applesauce , and I 'd thought of some red-flannel hash as well . " " Do Maine people exist entirely on beans ? Beans have been our meat day and night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Mrs. Baxter winced perceptibly at this airy reference to the Psalms as well as at my mother 's equally airy disposal of beans . " Well , beans are cheap and filling , and I never want to throw away good nourishing food . Has the minister consideredbuying a pig ? Most families around here keep a pig . There 's a natural place under the barn for one , and pigs alwayspay their way , come time for killing . Reverend Perkins had two , and they kept us going all last winter in hams and pork and bacon , to say nothing of hogshead cheese , and the eating up of all the table scraps . " " Kindly forget a pig , Mrs. Baxter , for the moment . Just now my husband thinks of nothing but sheep . "  | " Sheep do n't flourish in this part of Maine . Leastwise , almost no one keeps them . They get ticks . " " I do n't know what ticks are , but tell him they 're frightfullydangerous to human beings . Please do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning ? " " He 's fishing in the stream behind the pasture . " " Brook , we say here . " " Brook , then . " " Is he likely to bring home a string of trout in time for me to clean and fry them ? They 're always tasty and a real treat . " " Not a chance in the world . He took a book with him . " " Do n't he ever go anywhere without a book ? " " Never , I 'm afraid . " " Oh . Well , if you 're sick and tired of beans , there 's plenty of stuff for a nice red-flannel hash . " " Whatever do you mean by red-flannel hash ? It sounds like a poultice . " " Good beets and potatoes and some leftover bits of meat . We Methodists favour it for church suppers , but the Baptists stick to beans and brown bread . " " I see . Red-flannel hash will do superbly . The children will have something new to write home about . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' League tomorrow afternoon , have you ? " " Alas , no ! I wish I could . Whatever do we feed them ? " " I 'd planned on cupcakes , plain and chocolate both . With tea , I suppose . " " Admirable ! I 'll make the tea . At least I know how to do that . " " You English drink a powerful lot of tea . Are you sure it 's good for the children ? Folks around here always think that too much tea is  --  well , binding to the bowels. "  | " It 's never bound me . I 've drunk it from six months old on , and I do n't know anything that 's made me feel more free . I hope I have a good cup or two on my deathbed . " Mrs. Baxter winced again at this irreverent mention of a solemn hour . " The ladies really prefer coffee , but the cream 's slack just now . The cow 's not giving down too well . I tell your husband she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calm down . " " I 'm skittish , too , and I 'm afraid I wo n't calm down . I 'm going for a walk . I ought to stay inside and darn socks and write letters and help you in a dozen ways . But I ca n't  --  not with all this amazing colour . " " It is nice , " Mrs. Baxter said , glancing through her clean and shining windows . " But I 've seen it so often that I suppose I just take it for granted . " " Do n't take anything for granted ! " my mother called back from the open doorway . " It 's fatal , and I mean just that . Fatal , Mrs. Baxter ! " Probably our new housekeeper took us children for granted far more easily than she was able to take our parents , who , although neither exerted any mastery over her , were her overseers , not to mention the added fact that my father was the present leader and custodian of her sturdy religious adherence . From the hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tidy ways . Ansie and I , whom she looked upon as an inseparable team since we did most things together except when other boys claimed Ansie 's time and interest , clambered more slowly into her good graces through our early dependence upon her in the matter of food . When we hurried home from school in the late afternoon , we alwaysburst in the side door upon her faultless kitchen . For the first few days we hardly knew whether to be pleased orp126terrified to see her sitting there , by the window , in her red rocker , herself scrubbed like her yellow floor boards , her skirts covered by a starched white apron , her hands always busy at knitting or crochet , her eyes on the clock on the shelf above the sink , her nose carefully assessing her oven or her polished stewing pans , her hair in strict precision . But once she began putting out cookies and milk for us of her own free will without our so much as hinting at hunger , we knew that the game was won . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as all women , I was discovering , really preferred boys to girls , just as the faces of mothers were always more brightly illumined at the sight of sons rather than of daughters . Even Mrs. Baxter 's firm red cheeks creased with pleasure whenever Ansie asked her for an extra cooky or a bit of twine , or sniffed expectantly around her gleaming stove . She proved a help to him with his arithmetic , which he fell into the habit of doing at her kitchen table in the evenings . " Sorry , father , " he would say , when we had all gathered in the sitting-room after supper , " but I 'm afraid Mrs. Baxter is a bit better than you are at these queer problems . Do you mind awfully if I ask her ? " My mother always answered him before my father had gotten around to do so . " Not in the least , " she said . " Delighted , in fact . And do n't forget to ask her  --  most politely , mind you  --  for our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in yourself . " Of Mrs. Baxter 's further past we knew nothing , since , like all English people , we were shy of personal questions , and she did not evince any eagerness to enlighten us . She seemed to have been eternally involved with Methodist preachers . Reverend Hinckley , Reverend Wilson , Reverend Perkins , our forerunners in the parsonage , were but threep127among the many whom she had known and without doubt rigorously nurtured even though not under the inherited rooftree . Mr. Baxter had evidently died at a fairly early age . What his life had been like with Mrs. Baxter was , to my mother at least , a subject of amused conjecture . My father 's immediate pleasure in Pepperell extended to his church . This stood perhaps a quarter of a mile westward from the parsonage and on the opposite side of the rising country road . It was a dignified , even stately white church of the type often seen in old New England villages . It had four rounded white pillars at the entrance , a graceful steeple , green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either side , through which the sunlight fell across its high-backed white pews . Behind it woods rose , green and still , and it was flanked by open fields . In every respect it was a church rather than a chapel . From his researches into the ecclesiastical history of eastern Maine my father learned that the church had originally been of the Congregational denomination like the great majority of those Maine coast churches founded in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries by stout Puritans from Massachusetts , of which Maine itself had been a northern province until 1820 , when it became a state . He also gathered that among the various Protestant sects in Maine and , for that matter , throughout New England the Congregationalists from the time of the earliest settlements had held first place in social as well as in religious esteem . The Methodists and Baptists , who had appeared later in most communities and largely by way of itinerant or of lay missionaries , were in a distinctly subordinate position from the start and also of relatively inferior variety in matters of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descendants of the Congregational founders of our parish now were , whether their zeal had diminished or whether they had left Pepperell for wider and more gracious fields of activity , was never quite clear . If any of them remained among us , they were not voluble concerning their former doctrinal adherence or apparently dissatisfied with their present lot . Community memories , and loyalties as well , are destined , however sadly , to grow dim and uncertain during half a century . All that my father seemed able to discover was that the Methodists had superseded the Congregationalistssome fifty years previously and most wisely had taken over their really beautiful church . And this wisdom was more strongly borne in upon him as he grew further acquainted with examples of purely Methodist architecture in neighbouring coast towns and villages . The only other church in Pepperell besides our own was the Baptist church ; and it was always called the Baptist meetinghouse instead of the Baptist church . Since this difference in terms was at first confusing to my father , who was aware of no visible social contrast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deplored any such distinction , he tried to discover the source of its widespreadusage . There was none , the Baptist minister told him , except that of custom . For some reason , doubtless as unimportantas it was obscure , the Baptists favoured this name for their rather graceless , nondescript brown-shingled buildingwhich stood nearer the centre of the village than did ours . In quantity they were much the same as we ; in quality , likewise . Indeed , it was difficult to detect any outstanding dissimilarities between our respective congregations except for the practice of immersion of converts in the cold water of the harbour which the Baptists strictly observed whatever thep129season , and , as my mother somewhat lightly added , their predilection for baked beans instead of red-flannel hash for their frequent church suppers . In general we typified two inconsequential country parishes , strongly Protestant by inheritancerather than by informed intelligence , uninclined to question matters of either doctrine or observance , each devoted by habit and tradition rather than by studied convictionto its own adherence , both struggling to obtain the means for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affairs and in public performances , covetous of new recruits only once a year . Our counterparts might have been found in a thousand other rural communities , similarly situatedand as meagrely endowed . Mr. Kimball was the Baptist minister , and like all other ministers in our region he was called Reverend Kimball , a title which was never granted any helpful article to lend it grace or dignity . He was an elderly man and had held his charge for years , since the Baptists , unlike the Methodists , tended toward permanence in the tenure of their pastors rather than toward frequent change . The most charitable estimate of him could not accord him more than a modicum of learning or any deep desire for increasing it . His theology was rigid and unyielding ; but its terrors did not seem to cause him any personal alarm though he often gave fervent utterances to them from his pulpit . He was kind and cordial . In his hours free from pastoral duties , which he performed diligently and well , he dug clams , picked berries , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide for his own table and , therefore , eke out his slender salary . Not infrequently he brought us some of the fruits of these avocations . His wife was a busy , tired , angular woman , who was famous locally for her unsurpassed cooking , for her good works , and for her cheerless willingness to perform all manner of parishp130duties unpalatable to others . My father and Reverend Kimball did not discover many interests in common . Mr. Kimball 's theology was so tightly done up and put away that it was difficult of easy access , unlike that of the vicar at home  --  which was probably , on the whole , fortunate . He did not care much for books in general , and he recognized no past beyond that of Pepperell and his long stay there . There were no discernible antiquities in Maine ; my father preferred trout to flounder fishing ; and Mr. Kimball , like most of the people in Pepperell , neither rode a bicycle nor was interested in ranging the countryside to observe its natural gifts . Nevertheless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the good advice of St. Paul ; and if my father was puzzling to his fellow preacher , that in itself was not strange , my mother said , since he was still a puzzle to her after some fourteen years . Moreover , any whims or vagaries on his part which seemed odd and unorthodox to Mr. Kimball could be safely and even generously explained on the ground that he was a foreigner and , of course , as yet unacquainted with the ways of a new religious environment . We all sadly missed the Church of England , at least in its outward and visible forms . It was difficult to accustom ourselves to the total absence of those square , grey-stone towers rising above clusters of trees and snug green churchyards , never to see in this new land Norman porches or fourteenth-century window tracery , never to smell that damp , musty , clinging smell of many centuries , never to hear peals of bells echoing for Evensong across quiet meadows and over slow streams . My mother unwillingly learned to call Anglican churches Episcopal ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her early religious upbringing since only the larger towns and cities in Maine had any Episcopal church.  |p131They  were all out of her reach except by a considerable train journey even if , under the circumstances , she had felt it wise upon rare occasions to seek one out . The Roman Catholics had no existence whatever at that time in rural Maine . They were all safely confined to the few distant industrial centres or to the French settlements well beyond the Canadian border . Needless to say , both theirabsence and their remoteness were sources of suspicious relief to a community so entirely Protestant as our own . In short , the Methodist bishop had been quite accurate in what he had told my father . The State of Maine , New England , and the greater part of the United States as a whole were at the turn of the century almost entirely , in the English term , Nonconformist ; and since America from the start had determined against an Established Church , from the very idea of which her founders had fled , she had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designate any of her various sects . Surely , no costs which my father was to pay for his decision to come to America were levied by his new religious environment . They could not be ascribed either to the Baptists or to his own Methodist congregation . Instead , they lurked , as such costs always lurk , within the fabric of his ownnature , in that Fate which as the ancients well knew eachman bears inescapably within himself " for good or for ill " and often for a mysterious and unfathomable entanglement of both . During our first winter in Pepperell my mother occasionally observed that , in a country dedicated to the principle of nonconformity , we were in actual practice required to conformto more than a few distasteful customs . My father'sp132cheerful reply to that observation was , first , that any archdeacon'sdaughter who had been rash enough to marry a Wesleyan parson should not at this late date be overly distressedby distasteful features in her recklessly chosen life , and , second , that in all honesty she should use the adjective to describe her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distasteful custom in his new parish . In general , he said , he saw as yet no reason to disagree with Alexis de Tocqueville in his praise of the simplicity which marked Christianity in America . It was true that he and Mr. Kimball hardly saw eye to eye in church manners and methods ; but he had met such divergence elsewhere and had no intention of conforming to habits not his own . It was even more true that the first week in January , known as the Week of Prayer and dedicated in Pepperell , as in many other Maine villages at that time , to the fervent recruiting by both churches of those who were outside their folds , did cause him more than a little distress because such covetous zeal was at variance with his own convictions , which held that , though all men were erring , none was irretrievably lost . Still , one week out of fifty-two meant only an infinitesimal percentage of vexation , especially since Mr. Kimball was only too happy to take precedence over my father in its ardent practices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' snowfall at the beginning of that trying period helped immeasurably to tranquillize its annoyances . None of us , accustomed to the brief and infrequent snow flurries and squalls of East Anglia , had ever before imagined such snow , coming in the midst of what was known in Maine as an " open winter , " lying five feet deep in the valleys , softening the contours of the hills , etching the black trunks of the trees , enclosing all in profound white silence.  |p133My  father , watching the flakes drift downward from an almost windless sky and experiencing for the first time that feeling , old to rural New Englanders but unknown to him , of the snug safety of man and beasts , was so overcome by wonderand satisfaction that my mother forgot for the time being those distasteful customs which had prompted her exasperation  --  theendless succession of church suppers , missionary meetings , Sunday-school parties , ladies ' sewing circles , Youth Leagues , not to mention the Week of Prayer itself , which had tested all her powers of endurance and charity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was clearly inevitable : that of family prayers . Even my mother conceded their necessity from the start . What with Mrs. Baxter 's Methodist upbringing and the examples of Reverends Hinckley , Wilson , and Perkins together with their respective families , it would have been unthinkable to dispense with them in a parsonage inherited from a Methodist deacon or elder . Mrs. Baxter had upon our arrival granted us a few prayerless days to get settled in ; but it was evident that she considered this interim one of real sacrifice on our part , and we all lacked the courage to disillusion her . Still , when I look back on family prayers in Pepperell , I do not for a moment regret our conformity in this respect . They seemed a part of the newness of everything rather than unreal and awkward as they had seemed in Saintsbury . They had many redeeming , even attractive features . Once my mother had recognized that circumstances made them imperative , she conceived several notions to make us all enjoy them . Among our temporary legacies in the parsonage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plaintive , but responsive to her fingers in playing hymns . We always began prayers , which were held directly the breakfast table had been cleared , with a hymn , the first verse of whichp134Ansie was encouraged to sing by himself . Then , as a further innovation , each of us children in turn became responsible for the daily Bible reading , which we might select as we chose , and this honour in itself afforded us no little pride . With the imminence of school in mind , my father 's prayer was always brief , quiet , and assured , as though the presence of God among us were certain rather than asked for . If there was time after his Amen , we sang another hymn , which Mrs. Baxter always wanted , clearly because of Ansie ; and then a great clatter ensued as we got our books , lunchboxes , and coats together and dashed to school . Mrs. Baxter herself added impetus and enjoyment to family prayers although I am sure she was quite unconscious of any such contribution . She came in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , having as a mark of respect shed the sombre grey or black one in which she did her work . She looked solid and reliable like some tutelary guardian of stout tradition , or , as my father said , like one of those capable women in the Book of the Acts who had welcomed and cared for the earliest apostles on their missionary journeys . During the first days of our corporate devotions she seemed austere and somewhat solemn , but by perceptible degrees she grew much less severe up to the point of expectancy . She was not used to hearing the Scriptures read by children , yet she was clearly pleased by it . She loved to hear Ansie sing , and , if our choice of hymns seemed odd , since she was more accustomed to the " Throw out the Life Line " variety , she became reconciled to them , especially after my mother in a flash of inspiration confided to her that they were Ansie 's favourites . Our form of worship may well have seemed singular in comparison with what the Methodist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safely attribute to unfamiliar English ways.  |p135She  had a large , sleek tiger cat to whom she was devoted and whose name was Chessy . One late October morning when the last of the bright leaves were floating slowly downward and the early sunlight was streaming across the sitting-room , Chessy crept into prayers . Her entrance went at first unnoticedsince we were at that moment on our knees awaiting my father 's Amen ; but when she began to purr loudly as she entwined herself around his legs , her embarrassed mistress sprang up to extricate and banish her . My father , however , merely scooped her up in his arms and hastily closed his prayer with her draped over his shoulder . From that day on she came regularly to prayers , sitting on Mrs. Baxter 's lap while she cleansed her face with delicate sweeps of her paw or entwining herself about any legs she fancied . Unorthodox as her presence seemed , at least to Mrs. Baxter , she really lent an air of delightful informality to our family group . And once my father had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lesson while one of us children held Chessy , we all found ourselves quite converted to morning prayers in Pepperell . The village of Pepperell , like most other sizable villages on the long , deeply indented Maine coastline , was in the year 1901 a far different place than it had been a century or even half a century earlier . In those distant days it was a busy seafaring town , given to the building of ships designed for foreign commerce , able to boast of shipowners and merchants , men who knew the world far beyond the confines of narrow harbours . Upon the invasion of steam , which had meant the death of busy trade by sail , and the shifting of population either to the cities or to the free farming lands of the Great West , these more substantial citizens , if they had not died ,  |p136had  departed for more challenging and lucrative pursuits than fishing or than hammering upon small boats in a drowsy village . Perhaps among them , my father thought , had been those superior Congregationalists who had built our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a matter of fact , quite correct in spite of the fact that there remained few active memories to bolster his assumption . The invasion of summer residents which was shortly to recast the entire social and economic aspect of the coastline had not as yet reached eastern Maine or for that matter transformed many of the harbours westward . The prices soon to be offered for land on the sea frontage had not begun to amaze its owners ; country roads were still muddy , dusty , frozen into ruts , or packed with snow with the change of seasons ; and the rare sight of an automobile making awkward progress over them during the summer months meant not so much a prophetic warning as merely an object of curiosity to surprised onlookers and of complete terror to horses . Pepperellin common with a hundred other coastal communities was during our sojourn there experiencing not too consciouslyan interim between two civilizations , one decaying and all but dead , the other totally unimaginable . In such a village the last institutions to undergo decline were probably its schools , both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New England , as a result of tradition , there has lingered a tenacious pride in at least the idea of all good learning . When we three children went to school in Pepperell , moving from the grammar school to the academy , we escaped by fully thirty years the relinquishmentof Latin on the ground that it was too difficult for the average boy or girl and " useless " as well , just as we escaped the pounding of typewriters , the classes in home economics and " shop , " that change in emphasis from thep137mental toward the manual , from the attainment of knowledge for its own sake to its practical application in daily affairs which for good or for ill was eventually to invade most American public school systems . Country schools in isolated districts still flourished at the turn of the century and for fully fifteen years thereafter , for in a motorless age consolidation was beyond comprehension . History was still history instead of a social science ; and it had not yet occurred to anyone in authority that a stiff drilling in English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study of square and cube roots in arithmetic . Even though past prosperity together with its relation to a larger world had vanished in villages such as Pepperell , there still tarried among its more thoughtful citizens an almost curious pride in the stamp which it had once placed upon the community ; and nowhere was this pride so nurtured as in its schools . Without doubt our teachers , many of whom were local products , were largely responsible for its continuance , for they had known Pepperell in its better , more dignified days . They were , for the most part , middle-aged or elderly women , who in a time of little running about had held their posts for years . They could not , I am sure , have been too richly endowed ; yet , since we possessed no standards of comparison higher than Miss Caxton and the elementary school in Saintsbury , they seemed not only adequate but excellent to us . And our parents , seeing that we were strictly disciplined and encouraged toward diligence in study and recognizing themselves as strangers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause for complaint . I have often wondered since those days about my father 's contentment , even extreme delight , in Pepperell . Not a little of it sprang , I suppose , from his own country upbringing , from those basic , ingrained satisfactions which only thep138countryman knows : the skies , the seasons , the soil , the weather , the friendly struggles with them all possible only from a long and sympathetic association . And here in this new land these satisfactions were increased by a human intimacy which he had not known in England . There , few if any village parsons cut and gathered in their hay , cared for a horse and cow , shared those common , fraternal experiences not alone with all members of their parishes but with the community at large . Here , although a man was in no sense a farmer in terms of his actual vocation , but instead a boatbuilderor a fisherman , or perhaps a storekeeper or a house painter , or even the village doctor or lawyer , he nevertheless had a barn in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which to feed them . These alliances , together with the unsparing hospitality always characteristic of an essentially pioneer people , afforded my father that gift of freedom in social relations , that underlying harmony in human fellowship and mutual dependence which he had all his life desired . He must surely have missed the nearness to libraries and museums which he had known in Cambridgeshire ; Saxon remains and relics ; the Devil 's Dyke ; and Bury St. Edmunds ; but for the time being even these seemed to be compensated for . He had his books and , as in Saintsbury , spent long hours within them . All true scholars and thinkers are lonely ; yet their loneliness is never that of the egotist , or the thwarted , or the cynical , whose sense of isolation is often embittered by resentment . The solitude which is the lot of the idealist or the visionary knows no anger or resentment , because he lives , or believes that he lives , with the imperishablerather than with the transient . My father 's life , in comparison with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , never completely fulfilled except in hope and confidence ; and yet it was a dream ill exchanged for those **26;2014;TOOLONG must incompletely content most of us during our threescore years and ten . And lastly he could enjoy , at least at the beginning of our stay , that perverse , slightly absurd pleasure which aliens instinctivelyfeel from finding themselves in an unfamiliar land , that sense of individualism tinged perhaps with a certain quite harmless importance . This , as all perceptive travellers and sojourners recognize , often with amusement , is in itself a remedy against the pangs of homesickness , the loss of the familiar and the well known . Strangeness and even sadness resulting from voluntary exile possess a paradoxical way of enlivening themselves . We children felt this odd contradiction in emotions during our first year in Pepperell . We enjoyedour alienism , our difference in speech and habits , the curiosity which we engendered . My father , I am sure , for he was intensely sensitive to all human experience however simple , shared this singular excitement . In his turn he enjoyed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minister " from far away " ; their eager interest in his ways and manners . In the end these may have proved a frail support ; but in the beginning they were not without their strength and their ingenuous pleasure . None of us was ever to forget our first New England spring . Even without the events which it set in motion , it was memorable in itself , perhaps not so overwhelming as the autumn , but startling enough for those , like us , totally unusedto its sudden ways , its quick release from the long , close bondage of winter . A few warm days in late April , and everything burst forth at once with none of the laggard reluctance of an English spring . The snow melted as if by magic from hills and meadows to form a thousand tinyp140streams and grassy pools ; the tides , resentful of their narrow boundaries , inundated the lower fields and marshes ; in a matter of hours , it seemed , the harbour ice , which for months had distorted the rocky shores in jagged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everywhere there was the sound of running water . The catkins of the willows quickly clothed their sober grey with flecks of gold ; the ferns along the roadsideditches cut the gravelly earth with their tightly rolled fronds ; through a warm , soft night or two , buds swelled and burst until the treetops were mists of green in the morning sun . The woods with no warning at all , my father said , began to foam with the white of shadbush and the frail panicles of the wild cherry . The arbutus trailed its pale-pink flowers through the damp undergrowth of the pastures . Birds came back , apparently all at once like everything else . On one morning the familiar rippling of water ; on the next the vivacious outpourings of song-sparrows , the whistles and grace notes of whitethroats , the falling , bell-like cadences of thrushes . The gulls came sweeping in , no longer riders of winter winds and prophetic of storms in their slow , dark circlings , but darting and swooping in the sunlight , busy on their own swift errands between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new warmth of rocks and piers . One evening at sunset we were excited by a high clear trilling which seemed to be so completely surrounding us that to locate it was impossible . " Peepers , " Mrs. Baxter said . " When they begin all at once to sing like this , there 's sure to be no more winter . It 's gone for good . " Spring burst almost as suddenly into our red barn and across our pasture . Lilla 's calf , expected in mid-May , came a full week earlier and in no time at all was frisking amongp141the hummocks and the blueberry bushes . Snow White 's stiff old legs limbered up so quickly that she surprised my father by her speed and litheness when he drove behind her into the hills to see how some upcountry Methodists were faring . And since they were faring well and were unable to resist this prodigal deliverance from snow and cold , these warm winds which melted their tough hearts as well as their stark uplands , they insisted on his bringing home two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of his more tangible dreams come true , my father felt , he said , like a country squire viewing his acres , appraising his livestock , even though his estates were borrowed and his suddenly multiplied creatures , except for Lilla herself , gifts of good will . With all this blossoming and burgeoning of what had been so lately a frozen and snow-clad land , this bursting forth of new life in barn and pasture , a similar quickening reanimated the parsonage . Mrs. Baxter sang lustily over her spring housecleaning , a work of complete redundance , my mother said , since we were almost indecently clean at all times , yet one clearly of sacramental importance to Mrs. Baxter , who , only too eager to perform her rites alone , rejoiced when my mother made herself scarce withindoors to study American birds or to gather boughs of wild crabapple for our fireplaces . My father fished the swollen streams or was initiated with us children into the delightful mysteries of catching smelts , which crammed the brooks on spring tides and which we scooped up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evenings , while the peepers called , and Mrs. Baxter communedhappily in the kitchen over her starched muslin curtains , and we drank our tea , we made beautiful , chimerical plans for summer holidays in this immense country of our adoption.  | " I do want us all to see the White Mountains , " my father said . " And there 's California . We must manage that before too many years . " On the afternoon of Memorial Day , a new commemoration to us , but one of vast importance to Pepperell and , we quickly gathered , to the whole of America , my father gave the annual oration to the village at large and to much of the surrounding countryside as well . The invitation was doubtless tendered out of courtesy to him as a stranger , or perhaps only because in a district as sparsely settled and relatively unimportant as our own , speakers were difficult to obtain ; yet whatever the reason for the distinction , complimentary or merely convenient , he made such a notable address on " Lincoln in the Eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only to his own but to our combined stature . Mrs. Baxter , sitting in the front pew of the church with us all , was overcome by such astonishment and pride in my father 's eloquence and bearing that any misgivings which once had troubled her as to his success as a preacher or as a person were wholly obliterated . She became , indeed , so exuberant and expansive on our triumphal walk homeward that my mother forgave her even the turmoil of spring cleaning and willingly acceded to her determination to bake a fresh cake in honour of the bishop , who would arrive later with my father for tea . For this Methodist dignitary , the selfsame one who had met my father in London , had without any warning travelled miles by train and carriage to see how his alien protege was making out in his new parish and had fortunately chosen Memorial Day for his pastoral visitation . The tea party , which we held in the orchard under the blossoming trees , was presumably an unconditional success ,  |p143although  it was not without its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after we had excused ourselves from it to scrape her frosting bowl and finish up the remains of the cake in the kitchen , that she had never in all her years in the parsonage seen its like . In the long run , she said , she saw no point in decent folks eating out-of-doors , what with caterpillars , bugs , bees , and general messiness ; but in this instance my mother had without doubt been in the right . The bishop had obviously looked upon the tea party as a delightful novelty which he had enjoyed to the full ; and to say that he had been impressed by my father 's eloquence in his address expressed , she was convinced , not the smallest common fraction of his actual admiration . I could detect an undertoneof sadness in Mrs. Baxter 's generous enthusiasm , which Ansie , busy over the frosting bowl , was not so quick to sense , even though he himself was responsible for the major part of it . I knew , with an odd rush of affection for her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our leaving Pepperell before too long for some richer , more fruitful Methodist vineyard ; and I carefully refrained from telling her that the conversation at the tea party had made her fears far from groundless . I felt sure that my mother , far more acute than my father in the summing up of human personality , was not drawn toward the bishop from the start . Perhaps her hesitancy had its origin only in her early and long experience with ecclesiasticalpotentates ; perhaps the bishop 's size , his distinctly pompous language , and his somewhat complacent manner hindered her approval of him . She allowed none of these reservations , however , to alter in the slightest degree her role of hostess , which she executed with such grace and charm that the bishop easily extended his high opinion of my father to include her also . Nor was he in the least aware that herp144ambitions for my father and her extemely realistic view of Pepperell as a place of more than temporary sojourn for him were most assuredly playing their invisible parts under the apple trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our behaviour , comported ourselves with quite the proper mixture of respect and friendliness . " Well , " said the bishop , when he was once settled in a wicker armchair , which Ansie had brought from the house for his comfort and which creaked beneath his weight , " this is a delightful and a rare occasion . An old English custom in a New England setting . Most refreshing to see the former ways still venerated and the latter ways so quickly and easily embraced . I trust , my dear lady , you have not found your displacement too difficult . " My mother 's slight wince , caused both by his manner of address and by the notion of tea as an object of veneration , was , I am sure , perceptible only to us . " Not in the least , " she said brightly . " How could anything be difficult with everyone so kind ! " The bishop rubbed his rather fat hands together in satisfaction . " Capital ! " he cried , while the chair creaked ominously . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Precisely what I hoped and prayed for when I saw your husband in London . A man in my position with the future of so many human souls in his keeping has onerous responsibilities , I assure you . Our Conference has never before imported a foreigner to a parish ; but I felt impelled to do so in the case of Brother Tillyard . And his really superb performance this afternoon has amply justified my faith , or , I may more truly say , my vision of what he had to offer us . " My father from his seat beside Ansie on a long wooden bench looked uncomfortable . His eyes kept straying acrossp145the field to the pasture where his two new lambs were already merrily at home . Ansie broke the somewhat heavy silence . " We all love America , sir , " he said helpfully . " Fine , my son , " the bishop said . " Precisely what I have hoped to hear . " He turned again to my mother . " America prides herself on her kindness to the stranger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the life line , as it were , across the dark wave to all who want better things . She 's a refuge for the homeless and the oppressed . She 's a land of promise in very truth . " My sister Mary at this moment from her stool beside my mother felt called upon to make with some spirit a not too tactful remark . " We really were n't homeless or oppressed in England , " she said . The bishop , to do him credit , was amused . " That 's right , my dear , " he said . " Keep the home flag flying along with the Stars and Stripes ! We 're one people in very truth in spite of old differences . I often used to say to myself God Save the Queen ' after singing our own national anthem . The fact is , I said it this very day in respect for your father as well as for that truly noble sovereign of so many years . How the world misses her venerable presence ! " Mary now felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I love America , too , " she said . " So do I , " I echoed from my seat beside Ansie . My mother kept glancing nervously at her watch pinned on the front of her blue muslin dress . My father still looked at his lambs . " Mrs. Baxter would make a fresh cake for you , sir , " my mother said , " but I 'm sure she 'll be only a moment more . She was icing it just as you arrived . "  | " A noble woman , Mrs. Baxter , " the bishop said , " and what a veritable tower of strength to a long succession of our pastoral brethren . Would that we had a hundred Mrs. Baxters in our communion of saints ! " " She 's most awfully good at arithmetic , too , " Ansie said . The bishop laughed again . " Capital ! " he said . " That 's capital . How old are you , my boy ? " " I 'm going on for twelve , sir , " Ansie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eleventh birthday . " And what are you planning to do with yourself ? Shall you go to Harvard or Yale or perhaps to Bowdoin in this good old State of Maine ? I can see that you 're cut out to be a most able scholar like your father here . " " I 'm thinking of going back to England , " Ansie said , " to go to my father 's college in Cambridge . But that 's after six more years , of course . " He looked at my mother then as though , since she had saved him from York , she could , singlehanded , secure Cambridgefor him ; and she smiled back at him , her whole face all at once alight , even the bishop in his creaking chair forgotten . In her smile I suddenly saw all the old familiar things : the slow fen streams with their swans and ducks ; the church of St. Peter the Apostle ; the glory of King 's Chapel where Ansie might once have sung had the ghost of John Wesley not intervened ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps my father saw all these things , too , for he said to the bishop : " I 'd rather like him to go back . I do n't want any of them ever to forget England . " " Quite right and proper , " the bishop said . " Let young men dream their dreams according to the ancient prophet . But who knows what may happen in the next few years ? "  | " Who , indeed ? " my father said , after the manner of someone who must say something . Tea mercifully came then , Mary and I running to help Mrs. Baxter with the tray . The bishop dutifully thanked her for all her faithful service in behalf of Methodism over many years ; and she swelled visibly with pride within the ample folds of her best white apron . He made a most excellent tea , as we should have said in England , with three well-sweetened cups , four slices of bread and butter , and two large pieces of Mrs. Baxter 's superlative cake . As he ate , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all ambitious men . Methodism , he told us , had spread like a tornado during the past fifty years , and even today it was sweeping phenomenally through certain of the newer western states . Ansie nudged me then , and we both shot sly glances at my mother , all of us with the Plimsolls in mind . " I take it , " he said to my father , " that you 've found all the things I told you in London to be very true ? " " Quite , " my father answered . " I always believe in calling a spade a spade , " the bishop said . " But with a great country like ours I could hardly mislead you or exaggerate . No Established Church , no foolish social distinctions , no discrimination among our many religious sects . In America , I 'm proud to say , all men are free and equal in the sight of God . " My father looked worried , even distressed . " I believe that all men everywhere are free and equal in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's only in the minds of other men that they 're sometimes not free and equal . " The bishop moved uneasily in his creaking chair and looked , I thought , more than a little discomfited . We were all conscious of an atmosphere of tension.  | " Why do n't you take our guest down through the field to see your flocks and herds ? " my mother said quickly to my father , meanwhile giving the bishop the most companionable of smiles . " My husband has become quite a farmer , " she explained , " thanks to the generosity of our new friends . He 's immensely proud of what he calls his stock . " It was remarkable how swiftly the bishop regained his composure . " The stock I 'm interested in just now is what I call my rolling stock , " he said to my mother with an almost conspiratorialglance , as though only he and she completely understood each other . " Good Methodist rolling stock , I mean . In other words , if I may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolling . And when we find a really outstanding specimen , " he continued with a deep and conciliatorybow toward my father , " we find a parish worthy of his gifts . In other words , my dear fellow , our Conference is going to see that your talents are not buried in the earth , so to speak . " " Thank you , sir , " my father said , for he could hardly fail to acknowledge the bishop 's bow . " Thank you very much , but there 's no haste . We 're quite contented where we are . " I 'm sure my mother at that moment in at least a portion of her mind longed to send the bishop another and more companionable glance , but love and understanding of my father forbade it . Seeing them both sitting there , one contentedand secure within the narrow boundaries of his own small sphere of paltry power and dull activity , the other quickened and eager in a measureless world of thought and selfless desire , she felt her ambitions for my father 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a place suddenly seemed to be of no consequence , of little real significance . It might instead have been London , or Rome ,  |p149or  ancient Athens . She smiled at my father instead of at the bishop . " My husband is quite right , " she said . " We 're not at all dependent on places . We always find what we most want wherever we are . " " I 'm immensely gratified to hear it , " the bishop said , including us all in broad , pastoral smiles . " All in God 's good time , of course . It would be a pity to snatch you away too soon from these good people here . But there 's sure to be another call for you , my good man , just as there was a definite one only a little more than one brief year ago . For I 've never had the slightest doubt that your propitious coming to our shores was the result of a direct call from God . " We all knew then that we were again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she at my father , who , we both saw , was getting ready to speak , struggling within himself between his honesty and his courtesy . Mary was the first to save us . She told me later that she all at once remembered that night in the parsonage at home when my father had set us straight about calls from God . " Would you please excuse me , sir ? " she said now to the bishop . " I must do my lessons . " " Certainly , my child , " said the bishop , rising from his chair to take her hand , " though with regret , of course . " l-le was so tall that a sprig of apple blossom from a bough above him rested on his smooth , bald crown . " And what lesson are you bending your pretty head over just now ? " " Latin , " Mary said . " I used to know Latin myself , but I 'm afraid most of it has long since vanished . Trans Alpes Italia est . That was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll wager that you can tell me what it means . " " It means Across the Alps lies Italy , ' does n't it ? " Maryp150asked . " Capital ! " cried the bishop with a resounding laugh . " Capital , my dear ! There may be many Alps for you to climb before you all reach your Italy . But it 's out there somewhere waiting for you , I 'll be bound , with Cicero here to give orations to a far larger audience than Pepperell . " By this time my mother 's silent appeals to my father had , however unwillingly , told upon him ; and the bishop 's fulsome comparison to Cicero had clinched the matter . Calls from God were clearly not to be discussed at the moment . " And now , " my mother said , crossing the grass to slip her arm within the bishop 's , " before you start back on your long journey , you simply must see our new lambs . " It was then that Ansie and I excused ourselves to carry back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to scrape her frosting bowl , which , against all her principles concerning the washing up of cooking dishes immediately , we knew she had been saving for Ansie . We all felt more than a little depleted by the bishop 's visit , and when he had once been loaded into the carriage of the kind parishioner who was to drive him ten miles to the nearest railway station , we proceeded to relax in our various ways during the hour before supper . My father and mother went for a walk in the pasture , telling Ansie that they would be responsible for bringing Lilla homeward ; and , since my father was careful to carry his pipe with him , we all realized that they had things of importance to talk about and welcomedno other companionship . Mrs. Baxter managed to salvage a quarter of an hour to sit down on the steps at the side door where she proceeded to admonish Chessy in her lap against her predatory instincts toward a pair of robinsp151nesting in the woodbine overhead . Mary , forsaking her Latin , climbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspected that she had a poem in mind . At going on fourteen she was given to outbursts in verse with Longfellow and Whittier as her rather distant models . My mother encouraged these , since they were a safety valve against her far more disturbing outbursts in prose which she not infrequently discharged upon the household . Ansie , freed from his task of fetching Lilla , decided to write Katie a letter about the doings of our momentous day while they were still fresh in his mind . And I , not a little disgruntled because no one , including Ansie , had any desire for my company , took David Copperfieldinto the hayloft where I promptly fell fast asleep over my favourite chapter about David in his little whitewashed room in Peggotty 's queer home . The events of that afternoon were to come sharply back to me many years later when Katie showed me Ansie 's letter , which she had kept among her treasures : My dear Katie , I think my father is likely to rise higher very quickly now . You will remember that bishop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I learned the poem on the Statue of Liberty which at first you did not much like . Well , he , I mean that bishop , has been here to see us and to hear my father make a very fine speech indeed . He made it this afternoon at two o'clock in our church here which as I have said before is not ever called a chapel as at home . I wish you and my grandparents , I mean Tillyard , not Oldroyd , might have heard the speech as you would all have been most awfully proud of my father . His speech was about Abraham Lincoln who was a very great American who freed the slaves or black people who were being opressed by their owners . If you should care to read a book called Uncle Tom 's Cabin , you could discover just how much they suffered in the fields of cotton in what is called the South . It is a most interesting book . This day , 3oth May , is called Memorial Day or sometimesp152Decoration Day . It is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Bank Holiday at home , only much more solem , when people decorate their graves and the graves of soldiers who died to make the slaves free . There is always a speech or an orrationmade , and this year my father was invited to make it . I wish you all might have heard him . This bishop at tea which we had for him in our orchard which as I have told you is like a garden at home only not so nice said my father 's orration was supperb . I do n't think it is spelled quite right , but you can see what I mean . I did n't like this bishop very much . He laughs a lot at things which are not very funny and talks a lot in large rolling words , and I do n't think my mother liked him much either . But he is the man who moves Methodist ministers or Wesleyan ones to any place he wishes , just as he likes , and I am sure he means to move my father soon to a more important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He said my father 's talents must not be buryed in the earth . Please tell my grandparents this because they will like to hear it . I shall be very sorry to leave Pepperell for I like it very much , but of course we all want my father to rise higher . Even if he does n't much care whether he rises higher or not , my mother does and so do I.Please tell my grandfather that we have two lambs now . They are named Primrose and Cowslip . They are a present quite free like Snow White and Mrs. Baxter who is not quite free but mostly , except for what my father calls a pitance . Many things in America are free , but at times I am very homesick for England and for you . Now I will answer all your questions. 1 . No . I do not ever hear from Moses . I am afraid he is not very happy in those Dakotas. 2 . Yes . We both do quite well at school , and Mary does even better. 3 . Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes them nice . Yes . I sing every morning and sometimes in church , too. 4 . No . I do n't use too much soap on my hair. 5 . No . Boys do not play cricket here . It is all baseball in the spring . Baseball is a most dificult game to explain , but I will try one day when I have a great deal of time and draw you a planp153of it too. 6 . No . I never forget that I am coming back to Cambridge to college . Y 's faithfuly forever . Ansie . P.S. Now , Katie , it is 9 o'clock and I am just going to bed , but I will add this news of great good luck . At supper this evening a man who is called a Select Man and is very important in Pepperell brought my father 5 new American notes for $5.0o each to thank him for his speech . That means 5 whole pounds in English money . We are all terriably excited as it was a great surprise . My mother knows just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't tell how until tomorrow . 1 will tell you later or my father will . He asks me to say that he is writing my grandmother at once . Ansie did well to add his postscript for we were all dumfounded by the contents of the long white envelope , which Mr. Packard , the First Selectman of Pepperell , deliveredinto the hands of Mrs. Baxter while we were just finishing our supper . When my father had opened it , read aloud with modest hesitation the few lines which said that the town wished to pay a tribute for a truly noble address , and spread the five fresh notes on the table , we all sat staring alternately at them and at one another as though neither we nor they could possibly possess any actual reality . Yet here we were and there they were , green , crisp , and clean , snapping and crackling in their newness as my father took each up in his fingers and then laid each down again on the white tablecloth . There they were , with on one side an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a stern face , and on the other so many fives amid scrolls of leaves that there could be no doubt whatever about their value . In both upper corners there was the figure 5 ; in both lower corners there was the very word FIVE ; and as though to make my father entirely certain that there had been de/posited for him in the year 1899 in the Treasury of the United States of America in Washington , D.C. , five silver dollars , there was in the centre of each note the Roman numeral V. My father separated them , making each to lie singly , then put them together again , then separated them once more . My mother finally found her voice after she had wiped her eyes with her napkin as my father read the letter . " And they do n't smell in the least ! " she said . " Smell ! " cried my father . " Smell ! Whatever do you mean , my dear ? " " All the money in this village smells of fish , " my mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Or has dried scales on it . You do n't mean to tell me you have n't noticed it ? " " Like the smell in David Copperfield 's room in the Peggottybarge , " I explained to my father , once I , too , had found my voice . " Fetch Mrs. Baxter , Ansie , " my father said . " It 's just possible that she knows something . " " Mrs. Baxter ! " screamed Ansie , forgetting his manners and in the tumult escaping reproof from anyone . Mrs. Baxter came in hurriedly to stare at the money on the table , but , although her presence added to our excitement , she knew nothing at all . She said , however , that she was vastly proud of Pepperell , which had never before , she could swear , given a speaker anything except the honour of the invitation itself . " The Selectmen must have called a special meeting , " she told my father . " And no wonder at all , sir , for , mark my words , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baptists alike . As to the bishop , I 'm sure he 's never heard such an address , no , not even from the Conference . " " Thank you , Mrs. Baxter , " my father said , " I must say it 's all quite incredible . "  |p155Mrs  . Baxter still stared at the money . " I hope I 'm not presuming , " she said , " but just in terms of plain arithmetic , that 's a real tidy sum , ministers ' salaries being what they are . As I reckon it , just in my head , of course , it 's more than two weeks ' pay , that is , if you do n't count in the parsonage and me . " " It 's overwhelming , " my father said . " But we never forget to count the parsonage and you , Mrs. Baxter . " " Whatever shall you do with it , father ? " Ansie asked , with the awe which we all felt in his voice . " I really ca n't think , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stunned . I 'd rather like to give it to the church for  --  " " Never ! " my mother cried so vehemently that we all jumped in our chairs and Mrs. Baxter braced herself for supportagainst the table . My father laughed from sheer surprise . " Well , " he said , " if that 's that , and I gather it is , how about putting it in the savings bank ? At six per cent compoundinterest , Ansie , it would take you across the ocean to Cambridge in six or seven years . " " I hope you do n't mean steerage , " Mary said anxiously . He smiled at her . " No , I do n't mean steerage this time , " he said . " We 're not waiting for any six years , " my mother said briskly , " to spend that money on Ansie . He can pick blueberriesto pay his fare to Cambridge . " We all looked toward her sitting opposite my father in her blue dress with its round white collar . It was quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ framer of destinies , as she had been for as long as we could remember . She looked young and eager in the low sunlight which streamed through the western windows . Her blue eyes were shining , but she suddenly covered them and all her face with the up/right palms of her two hands in a gesture to which we were well accustomed . Sometimes it meant that she was confused or irritated or even angry , or had had in general more than she could stand from all of us ; sometimes it meant only that she was thinking . You could always tell from the pressure of her fingers against her forehead just how dangerous it might be . Tonight we knew that it was not dangerous in the least . " There 's always my sheep , " my father said a bit nervously , watching her fingers . " This would buy six more lambs at least , eight tiny ones perhaps . " Mrs. Baxter started to speak , as though she , too , might have a suggestion about the disposal of at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had gotten a word well out , my mother pulled her hands away from her face and surveyed us all . I thought I had never seen her eyes so blue or her face so resolute and sure . " No sheep , " she said firmly . " Not even one more lamb . And , Mrs. Baxter , you can get rid of that pig right now , for I can see him sitting in your head . No more livestock , no savings bank , no present to the church . I know precisely how that money is going to be spent . I 've spent it a hundred times already in my mind , only it 's never been here to spend . But now it 's here , and you can all just put away any other silly ideas you may have . " " How ? " we all cried at once . " Tell us how you mean to spend it . " " In the morning , " my mother said . " Not a word until tomorrow morning ! " Ansie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms around her . " You 're mean ! " he cried . " You 'll tell father once you get to bed . You know you will ! " My mother was obdurate.  | " I wo n't tell him one word , " she said . " I promise I wo n't . He would n't sleep a wink if I did , and he 's tired after all his glory and that wretched bishop . " " She wo n't tell me , Ansie , " my father said . " You can rest assured as to that . " " Will you tell us before prayers or after ? " Ansie and I asked together . " We 'll omit prayers tomorrow , " my mother said , smiling benignly at Mrs. Baxter . " We 'll all get together right after breakfast to hear my secret . " Mrs. Baxter seemed entirely acquiescent about the omission of prayers . She merely said as she began to clear the table that she did n't expect to sleep a wink herself . We children helped her with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and guesses , not one of us proved to be so much as warm in our nearness to my mother 's secret . " I feel rather like the Hundred Thirty-ninth Psalm , " my father said , staring at my mother who had just told us all her secret . " Such knowledge is too wonderful for me . ' I simply ca n't get it into my head . " " Well , you really do n't need to , " my mother said . " All you have to do is just to go on Monday week . I 'll pack your lag for you . By that time you 'll probably wake up . At least , if you do n't , the rest of us will . Mrs. Baxter will drive you over for the train , wo n't you , Mrs. Baxter ? I just ca n't manageSnow White . She goes to sleep the minute I take the reins . " " Of course , I will , " Mrs. Baxter said , although she looked as though the parsonage would either disappear or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Of course , I will . I 'm ashamed to say it , I really am , but I justp158do n't know about this Walden Pond or this famous man  --  what 's his name again ? " " Thoreau , " my father said . " Henry David Thoreau . He 's a great hero of mine , Mrs. Baxter . " " Idol , he means , " my mother said . " We 've all been brought up on Thoreau , Mrs. Baxter . " " Living or dead ? " asked Mrs. Baxter . " Dead years ago , " Mary said . " But immortal , " my father said . " He wrote a very great hook , Mrs. Baxter , called Walden . I read it when I was a young man , and it has shaped my thoughts all my life . I 've wanted for many years to see Walden Pond  --  that 's where he lived for a time  --  but really , my dear , this is quite too much . I just ca n't take it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 've set my heart on your seeing that pond , so just do n't say another word . " " If you would only come , too ! I 'm sure that twenty-five whole dollars  --  " " I do n't want to go , so that 's that . I want you to go by yourself on your own pilgrimage . I 'd only get uneasy with you mooning about . If you 're by yourself , you can go off into all the trances you like . " " I still ca n't believe it , " my father said . " I feel very selfish , I must say . " " You could n't be selfish , sir , if you put all your mind to it , " Mrs. Baxter said . " Could I perhaps read that Walden book so I 'd know what to say when folks ask me where you 've gone to ? " " Certainly , " my father said , looking a bit worried . " Ansic , please fetch Walden from my study for Mrs. Baxter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " We were n't even warm , were we , Mrs. Baxter ? " Ansic said , starting for the study . " My guess was for another cow ,  |p159father  . Then we could sell the extra milk like the Kimballs . " " No more cows , " my mother said sternly . " Lilla cost thirty dollars , " my father said , " and really I only fully paid for her a few months ago . " " It 's a great pity her calf was n't a heifer , " Mrs. Baxter said . " Do n't let him live too long , sir , else you ca n't beef him . " My father looked distressed . " I really could n't have him killed now , " he said . " He loves the pasture . We might sell him at the County Fair in the autumn . " " Few folks around here buy young bulls , " Mrs. Baxter said . " And by then it 'll be too late to ox him . " " My guess was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly . " You need one awfully . " " Mrs. Baxter and I will get his grey one all pressed up , " my mother said . " He wo n't know what he has on anyway . He 'll do nicely . " " And come to think of it , " Mrs. Baxter said , " there 's two nice white shirts left at the church for the missionary barrel to Africa . If I just put on fresh neckbands , they 'll be good as new . Never give the heathen what you can use yourself . That 's my motto . " " You 'll see Boston , too , father , " Ansie said , coming back with Walden , which Mrs. Baxter began to page through with deepening anxiety , though she was somewhat comforted by my father 's careful markings . " And you 'll see where once the embattled farmers stood and fired the shot heard round the world . If there 's money enough , I 'd like a postcard of the Minute Man to show at school . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promised . " Frankly , " Mary said , " I guessed a new fishing rod and perhaps a bicycle . " " I would n't know how to fish here without an alderp160pole , " my father said , " and my old bicycle is good for years longer . " " This Walden looks rather deep for me , " Mrs. Baxter said , " but I 'll try to read all the marked places , sir . " " That 's fine , " my father said . He turned to my mother . " You remember Horace , my dear . Nil est ab omni parte beatum . Well , for just once he seems not to have hit it . " " Horace who ? " Mrs. Baxter asked . " I do n't recall any I-Ioraces around here . " " He was a Latin poet , " Mary whispered to her . " He 's another idol of my father 's , like Thoreau . " Mrs. Baxter with slightly heightened colour returned to Walden . " Horace , " my father explained kindly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in common . He once said , Nothing in every respect is happy . ' I suppose it holds true in most circumstances ; but just now with a dream of my life about to come true , I ca n't see one thing that is n't perfect . " My mother beamed upon him . " Why do n't you go fishing , darling ? " she asked . " Let your old sermon go for once . " " I am tempted , I must admit , " my father said . " I 'm afraid I ca n't settle down to sermons . " " Well , if I keep this Walden , " Mrs. Baxter said , " and you do n't go taking along that Horace man or someone else , you might get a nice string of trout . It would be a treat for us all and not cost a cent . " " I think I 'll just take my thoughts this time , " my father said . " I surely have plenty of those with this wonderful thing that 's happening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Mrs. Baxter looked doubtful about even thoughts on a fishing trip ; but she hurried off to work on my father 's suit while we reluctantly got ready for school . My mother beganp161singing to herself . She did not then remember that the most innocent of plans are sometimes subject to unexpected accidents , like King Saul 's searching for lost asses , which forced a tragic kingship upon him , or like Oedipus unwittingly meeting his unrecognized father , or like foolish young Camilla , who paid dearly for the flame-coloured garment which she coveted . My mother kept hoping from his departure on Monday to his return on Friday that my father would not be in the least disappointed in Walden Pond . She need not have worried for a moment , for he came home quite enraptured . Even with the railway running too close to it as , we would recall , Thoreau himself deplored ( though he had hoped that the engineers and firemen of his day were better men for the sight of it ) , and the consequent loss of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still perfect in my father 's devoted eyes . It was deep and pale green just as Thoreau had said and so transparent that one could see thirty feet down to its very bottom where the remains of old timbers lay in the yellow sand or pale , swaying reeds grew . Myriads of small fish flecked with gold darted about in the still , clear water precisely as Thoreau had seen them . " Some form of perch , I think , " my father said in the explanatory way of the dedicated fisherman . " Perhaps what they call sunfish here . " " Were you in a boat then ? " asked Ansie , as we all sat listening on the evening of his return . " Yes , " my father said . " We rowed out just before sunset and sat there for a full two hours . And  --  will you believe it ?  --  there were swallows skimming over the water , whitebreastedones just like those he writes about , and two hawksp162circling high in the sky . We sat there until darkness began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the twilight , and the hermit thrushes . The only possible drawback was that I could n't seem to realize that I was actually there . That consciousness kept escaping me in spite of all that I could do to grasp it . " " Did you see the pond in the morning , too ? " Mary asked . " Yes . It was blue then from a distance , reflecting the sky , just as he says in Walden ; but in the centre , in the deepest part , the water was pale green again . And very cold when we put our hands in it . You remember he says it was his well already dug for him . We explored the shores , too , which are sandy in some places and rocky in others ; and we went to the place where his cabin once stood and where his bean field was . But it was being on the pond itself which made all the difference . I shall never forget it . " He looked around upon us all , but rather as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own which made further questions about Walden almost an intrusion . Mrs. Baxter , less used to him than we were , may have felt uneasy , for she said abruptly : " You must have done a good bit of scrambling around , for I see you 've torn your pants . Maybe on a blackberry bush . " My father surveyed the damage to the right knee of his trousers . " That 's right , " he said . " I had n't noticed . I 'm so sorry . " " It do n't matter a mite , " Mrs. Baxter said . " I can set a patch . I 'm sure we 're all glad that you had such a good time . Everybody at the church was real pleased about your going , even if I could n't find many that knew about this Thoreau . " " That 's not strange , " my father said . " We all have our special heroes , do n't we ? " " I did read the places you 'd marked , though , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I can see he was a man full of good thoughts . " " He was , " my father said . " If all men thought as he did , there would be less sorrow and trouble in this world , and far more faith in life itself . " " Perhaps now you will love Walden Pond as much as Bury St. Edmunds , " Ansie said with a shade of regret in his voice . My father smiled at him and with the smile came back a littler closer to us . " No , " he said . " Bury always holds its own place . Somedaywe shall all go back to Bury . Walden is quite different . I do n't know just how to distinguish between them . Perhaps Bury is first in my imagination and Walden is first  --  shall we say ?  --  in my soul . " " I see , " Ansie said politely , although of course he did n't in the least . " Who 's this we ? " my mother asked , scenting things that my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boat with you , sitting on that pond for hours ? " " A most remarkable man , " my father said , returning now fully to the parsonage sitting-room . " I 'm not much given to believing in Fate as you know , but meeting this man , who became my friend almost at once , makes me wonder if things are n't sometimes arranged for one in a peculiar , even mysterious way . " " Well , go on , " said my mother . " Just forget Fate and tell us about him . " My father , thus admonished , told us then about his new friend , who , first of all , felt his own devotion to Thoreau. He had boarded the train in Augusta and shared my father 's seat ; and when he saw that my father was rereading Walden in preparation for his visit , what did he do but pull out anp164almost identical copy from his own pocket . " What a moment that was ! " my father said . " You can imagine it did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were in Boston before we knew it . " " Is he a parson , too ? " my mother asked . " No , he 's a doctor and , I take it , a very eminent one though he 's most modest about himself . He has charge of the big state hospital in Augusta for the insane . He was bound for Boston on some business connected with the hospital , but he could n't resist going to Walden again , though he 's been there several times before . He 's been an admirer of Thoreau for years , and he knows all his writings far better than I do . I must say that falling in with him seemed far more than just a coincidence . And on Wednesday and Thursday , when he was free , he joined me in Concord . " He hesitated . Then he said to my mother , " I do n't think I 've had such companionshipsince those faraway days when you and I were in Cambridge , at least in the realm of books . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see that this was one of the moments when she loved everything about him , even his irritating ways . " Perhaps , Mrs. Baxter , you could bear to get us all some tea . And now , " she continued once Mrs. Baxter had discreetly closed the door to the kitchen , " let 's hear the rest of it . I know there 's more than just sitting in that boat . What about this doctor ? What does he want from you ? " My father drew his pipe from his pocket , rose from his chair , and stood by the fireplace where some logs were burning . It was so exactly what he had done on the evening in the Saintsbury parsonage upon his return from London that I think we all felt alarmed as well as excited as though all our futures were at stake , as , indeed , they were . " It 's quite extraordinary , " he said . " I 'm not yet used to the idea . I had meant to tell you alone later on , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceivably affect us all in one way or another . This doctor , whose name is Thomas , Dr. Edward Thomas , wants me to be the visiting chaplain of this great hospital . They 've never had a visiting chaplain before , and his Board of Governors has left the choice of one quite up to him . He seems to feel as though I should look upon the people there in much the same way as he does , I mean his patients , some of whom are very ill , and others , he thinks , hardly ill at all , but only lonely for some outside companionship . He wants me to come there every month or so for a few days , talk with some of them , and try to help them . He thinks I could be of great service to them . I confess I was overcome by his request . I told him I could n't say at once whether or no until I 'd discussed it with my wife and family . " Not one of us said anything for what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a loss for words . Thoreau and Walden with its clear green water faded from our minds . Finally Ansie said : " Do you mean crazy people ? I mean really crazy people ? Or just queer ones like  --  well , like poor Smike in Nicholas Nickleby ? " " I really do n't know , Ansie , " my father answered . " I suppose there are all sorts . Only I do n't like the word crazy for anyone , and Dr. Thomas does n't either . These people are ill , and many of them are ill because they are lonely and desperate or have suffered sorrows and tragedies which they could n't weather . I ca n't believe I 'd have much to give them , but it would make me very happy to try . We 're all so rich in everything that matters that I 'd like to think we were sharing our wealth with those less happy than we are . " My mother suddenly left her chair and stood beside him . She put her arm through his . The love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still bright and warm within her , giving to her , as such love always gives , a longing to know all his thoughts , in so far as one can know another 's thoughts , to enter into his dreams whatever they might be , and to further their fulfillment . " Then you shall , dear , " she said . " We 'll all help you to do what you most want to do . " Many times in the years since that evening , more than half a century ago , all its assurances have returned to me , all that singular confidence and faith which love within a family alone can generate and nurture if only it is actuated by freedomand balanced by humour and understanding . As I saw my mother standing there with her arm within my father 's , I must have realized , else I had not so often seen them in my memory , what values they had all unconsciously taught us to place upon such illumined moments in human existence , what safety there might be in the very throwing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope . Beneath my parents ' love for each other there was something unassailable and immovable . On its surfaceit might willingly find room for irritation and annoyance  --  what love does not ?  --  and yet in between , where we all really lived , there were respect and ease and gaiety . Such love within a family is seldom the subject for words , perhaps because by nature it is silent ; but wherever it exists ( and it is rare , indeed ) it may well be the source for all other pure and passionate affections . At this moment , however , I was by no means lost in such abstractions , but rather seized by the most mundane and earthly of anxieties . Mary and I had all at once thought of another question . Perhaps we had seen it stirring around in my mother 's mind , in which many divergent and contradictoryquestions and emotions were always colliding with one another , and asked it in order to save her the embarrassment.  |p167Mary  as usual got it out before I did . " Are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father . " Or do you have to pay for being it ? " I concluded . My mother looked relieved that we had thus brought it out into the open , for even in the midst of those sorrows and tragedies which were uppermost in my father 's mind it was an important item to us all . " That 's another extraordinary thing , " my father said , " though in itself 1 do n't think it matters so much . But if we do decide that 1 shall go every month for a few days  --  and , of course , the Conference or at least the bishop would have to approve it  --  I would be paid fifty dollars for each visit together with all my expenses . " " Whew ! " Ansie said , whistling through his nose in a distasteful way which he had recently learned from a boy at school . " I guess you are beginning to rise higher , father ! " " I do n't think of it in terms of rising higher , Ansie , " my father said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people to rise a little higher in their minds , it would be wonderful . " Mrs. Baxter at that moment brought in the tea ; but , though my mother invited her to share it with us , she declined . I suspected that she might well be wishing just then , in the unpredictable way that most minds change from one point of view to another , that my father were a bit more like other Methodist parsons whom she had more safely known and my mother much more like their sensible and practical wives . In the late summer my father began his monthly visits to the asylum at Augusta with the full approval of the Conference and of the bishop . These continued throughout the autumn and the winter and into the spring of 1903 with/out noteworthy incidents except for the fascinating stories which he always brought home about his new friends there among the patients . Quite clearly the doctor had been right in his estimation of his new chaplain . The patients loved and trusted him , for with his genius for entering into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel free to talk with him about their problems and anxieties . I am sure that Mrs. Baxter disapproved of his sharing his often strange experiences with us children , and perhaps my mother sometimes questioned the wisdom of his confidences ; but he looked upon this quite differently and was , as usual , rather obstinate about his thoughts . " I 've never believed that painful things should be kept from children , " he said one evening in the midst of an especially exciting narration , for this time Mrs. Baxter had expostulated in a really definite way . " I think they ought to know about the hard , sorrowful things in life as well as about the happier ones . It wo n't hurt them at all . On the contrary , it ought to make them far more thoughtful and kind . I know I think quite differently from many others about this ; but I 've never believed in shielding children from a knowledge of things as they are . People are responsible for most of the sadness in this world , and people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can and eventually will . I do n't want my children sheltered from the sad things in life . No one can really experience pleasure unless he knows pain as well . It 's Plato who tells us that , you remember , " he concluded , turning to my mother . " Is this Plato another of your heroes ? " Mrs. Baxter asked , with a distinct tone of unwilling resignation in her voice . " Yes , " my father said . " Go on about the lady who makes the flags , " Ansie begged , impatient at the interruption.  | " It really was funny , " my father said , " and quite charming , at least in the way it turned out . We were walking aroundthe grounds yesterday morning , the doctor and I , when we came across this woman sitting on a bench and sewing some strips of red and white cloth together . It seems that at timesshe believes she is Betsy Ross and that she made the first American flag . She 's quite harmless and goes about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of red , white , and blue . She 's a great help to him , too , Dr. Thomas tells me , for she 's always gay and pleasant , and everyone likes her . The doctor introduced us , and we had a nice chat about her years in Philadelphia before General Washington asked her to design the flag . This all seemed so real to her that I began to believe it myself . And then all at once she seemed to comeback from her special world to this one , for she said to me , Are you a minister as they say you are around here ? ' I told her I was , and then she said , You would n't by any chance be a Methodist one , I suppose ? ' Yes , ' I said to her , that 's just what I am . ' I do n't like them , ' she said . I 've never liked Methodists in general , with good reason , and I hate Methodist ministers . One of them nearly killed me , many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know quite what to say to that , but luckily I did n't have to say a thing . For she suddenly drew a yellow rubber ball from the bag which held her red , white , and blue pieces , and said , Well , let bygones be bygones . How about a nice throw or two ? ' And before I knew it , we were tossing that ball back and forth in an open space on the lawn . " " I hope you were better at catching than you are with Inc , " Ansie said anxiously . " You wo n't believe it , Ansie , " my father said , " but I did n't miss a throw . I really caught every one , and some of them went quite wild , I assure you . She caught all mine , too.  |p170The  ball was one of those big ones that children play with , and we tossed it back and forth for all of ten minutes . You really would have been quite proud of me . I rather felt that all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of applause from men working about and even from some patients watching us from the windows . She seemed to forget how she hated Methodist parsons , and we had a wonderful time . She 's really a remarkable woman . " " Is she old ? " Mary asked . " Yes , she 's even very old , " my father answered , " but she seems very young . There 's something quite unique about her . I have n't discovered just what it is , but I shall in time . She 's been there for years , the doctor told me , but she 's quite contented , whether she 's Betsy Ross or just herself . She 's had a tragic , unbelievable life  --  he 's going to tell me more about it the next time I go  --  but she 's much better , even quite normal most of the time . I gather that she could leave at any time , but she does n't seem to have any place to go even if she wanted to . " My mother looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her name ? " she asked my father . " Mrs. Gowan , " he said . When my mother on Saturday , the 6th day of June in the year 1903 , saw fit to consult Mrs. Baxter about my father 's new and startling plan for certain of his friends at the asylum , she took me along to the kitchen with her . I suppose there were a number of reasons actuating her decision to talk over this problem with Mrs. Baxter . First of all , of course , was the purely practical one . Since Mrs. Baxter as the managerof our somewhat unpredictable household would perforcebear the largest share of the responsibility for anyp171changes in it , she must in all fairness be allowed to express her opinions . Yet I am sure my mother was prompted by other considerations . I think she needed to bolster her own misgivings by Mrs. Baxter 's down-to-earth realism , her hardpancommon sense , her peculiar , unreflective knowledge of us all . Moreover , behind and shot through our housekeeper 's solid , matter-of-fact , honest discernment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even imaginative respect for other minds . She might be puzzled by Thoreau and ignorant of Horace ; yet she recognized through a curious , perhaps paradoxical intuition that , though there were worlds into which she herself found it difficult , if not impossible to enter , such worlds might be the source of nourishment , even of life , to others . In short , in spite of Mrs. Baxter 's rigidity in matters of her hair , her kitchen , and her spring cleaning , she was a flexible , extensible human being ; and my mother on that June morning was really in desperate need of pliancy as well as of common sense . I do n't know exactly why she took me into the kitchen with her . Perhaps she needed even my frail support . Perhaps , in the way that most generous people in anxiety want instinctively to be of help or comfort to others , she saw that I had been rudely deserted by Ansie , who was building a raft on the shore with his friends , and scorned by Mary , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disconsolate and unwanted . Anyhow she said as she went through the sittingroom , " Come along and help me through this tough assignment , " which remark banished all my resentment and made me feel of immense importance . When we reached the kitchen , Mrs. Baxter was about to submerge four squirming dark-green lobsters into a huge kettle of boiling water , thus to end their lives and make them ready for our dinner . The lobsters had been a present fromp172Reverend Kimball earlier that morning ; and Mrs. Baxter as always was deeply satisfied over the thought of a delicious and quite costless meal . " Just a minute , " she said upon our invasion of her domain . " And if you do n't relish hearing them hiss as I dump them in , stop up your ears . I ca n't say I like it much myself , but it must be a sudden death else they would n't turn red so quick . And folks claim they do n't feel a mortal thing . " She lifted each of her wriggling victims most cautiously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the steaming kettle , which she covered at once with its close lid . " Twenty minutes to go , " she said , glancing carefully at the kitchen clock . " Now what 's on your mind ? " " I 'm sure it was most generous of Mr. Kimball , " my mother said , disregarding Mrs. Baxter 's question for the immediate moment . " Yes , ' t was , but , there , what can he do ? Sell them , I suppose , but if he sells them uncooked to the neighbours , that 's giving his wife away in kind of a public fashion . You see , she wo n't boil them . " " Wo n't she ? Whyever not ? " " Oh , some odd nonsense , I take it , about cruelty to animals . She 's a good woman , but awful notional . Between you and I , he has his worries , poor man ! Why do n't you sit down ? " My mother sat down in the red rocker while Mrs. Baxter took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me a cooky from the crock in the pantry . I sat on the kitchen table beside her . " Yes , " she continued . " I often think that life 's no bed of roses for Reverend Kimball . He 's a good man , too . Not that I 'm for a minute comparing him with our own parson . Ours may have his quirks , but after nigh on to two years I think he 's about the best man I ever knew . You 're a lucky woman . "  | " I realize that , " my mother said , grateful in view of the foreboding future that Mrs. Baxter had thus far almost dangerouslycommitted herself . " Where 's he off to this morning with Snow White ? " " Someone 's sick up in the hills , " my mother said . " Would n't you know it ? And on a sermon morning , too ? But , there  --  never thinking of himself . I sometimes wonder  --  I really do  --  what he 'll find to do in Heaven . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sturdily summoning up her courage , " I 'm more concerned with what he wants to do on this earth . That 's , in fact , what I 've come to talk with you about . " Mrs. Baxter looked surprised , if not alarmed ; and I , ignorant of my father 's plans , shared her concern and curiosity . The water in the kettle bubbled and steamed above the nowdeceasedlobsters . " We 'll , whatever it is , " Mrs. Baxter said , " it 's bound to be good for someone or other . He may be a bit queer in his ideas , but he could n't be anything but kind , so let 's hear the worst . I can see that you 're plumb worried . I can make you a nice cup of tea in a minute if you 've got a feeling for one . " " No , thank you , " my mother said . " I 'd rather get this matter off my mind and have the tea later . I just do n't know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite set his heart on inviting some of his friends from that hospital down here . I may as well be quite frank . He means those patients . He 's got the idea firmly in his head that certain of them need a change more than anything . He 's convinced they are quite all right  --  I mean harmless  --  only just lonely and friendless . They 'd be allowed to come , that doctor says , if only my husbandwill be responsible ; but as you very well know , that means you and me , too , actually you most of all , for you really run this house . His idea is to ask two or three of themp174for a few days each , or maybe for longer if things work out all right . Now whatever are you going to say to that ? " Mrs. Baxter lifted the lid of the kettle and poked somewhat viciously at the lobsters with a long-handled fork in order to ensure an equal space for all . She was quite clearly trying to hide her consternation and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I choked on my cooky , and she brought me a glass of water . My mother put her hands over her face in the familiar gesture , only at this moment her fingers were pressed too firmly against her forehead . " Well , " Mrs. Baxter said , " I 'm not going to say I 'm not some taken aback . I 've never had anything to do with crazy folks before . " " Father says they 're not really crazy , " I said . " I trust your father in most ways , dear , " Mrs. Baxter said . " But when it comes to who 's crazy and who 's not crazy , I 'm not so sure he 's entirely dependable . " She looked anxiously at my mother , whose fingers were still tight against her forehead . " Now do n't you go to fretting overmuch , " she said . " If that 's what he 's set his mind on , I suppose we 'll have to look at it straight in the face . Maybe we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who knows ? Anyhow just stop mulling it over in your head , or throw it all out of yours into mine for a spell . That might help a mite . Who are these folks he wants to entertain ? " " I honestly do n't know , " my mother said , pulling down her hands to stare helplessly at Mrs. Baxter . " He 's told me about so many of them that I get them all mixed up . I 'm sure they 're not in the least harmful  --  just  --  well , let us say , overly imaginative . After all , he would n't do anything dangerous to us . One he 's especially interested in believes at times he 's a Roman emperor . "  | " Are there any Roman emperors left ? " asked Mrs. Baxter . " I know there 's a Pope in Rome , but I did n't think there were any more emperors . " " There are n't , of course . That was centuries ago . It 's just in this man 's mind . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a teacher once , it seems . " She started to cover her face again with her hands but hesitated before Mrs. Baxter 's gaze . " Now do n't you go getting all het up again . I 'm here to help you out , not to make things worse for you . Just you say what you think about all this . I 'm ready and willing to listen . " " Well , " my mother said , " you just have to understand , first , that my husband is n't like most men , or most anybody for that matter . He lives in a different world from ours . He 's always longed to help people who are unfortunate or sad or troubled . He 's always believed that life is better than it is , or at least can be made better if everyone does his best to make it so . He was just the same when he was young as he is now , always trusting people , always believing that they 're just like him and want everything that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd call him an idealist , or a romanticist , or  --  oh , I really do n't know ! I only know that at times it 's terribly trying , Mrs. Baxter . " " It 's possible , of course , " said Mrs. Baxter in an unusually thoughtful way for her , " that he 's just a Christian , which the rest of us are n't . " " Perhaps , " my mother said . " I 've had hours in my life , though , Mrs. Baxter , when I 've wished he were anything but his sort of Christian . Still , " she continued bravely , " I suppose if you ask me what I honestly think , I 'll just have to say that I hate to be always thwarting him , or bringing him down to earth , or disbelieving in him , or putting barriers in his way.  |p176I  suppose it 's a little like what I feel about Ansie . " She had touched a tender spot in Mrs. Baxter 's armour . " What 's Ansie got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thing , " my mother said , " except by comparison . It 's just that I think people should be encouraged to do the things they most long to do in this world , even if only in their dreams . Just now Ansie thinks about nothing but being one of those cowboys in that new book we 've been reading aloud  --  you know , The Virginian . Of course , he 'll be nothing of the sort  --  it 's just a silly fancy  --  but it 's terribly real to him . I was ashamed of myself when I laughed at him the other day , really made fun of him , and he burst out crying . After all , it 's his dream , and it 's cruel to laugh at dreams , Mrs. Baxter , no matter how wild they are . " Mrs. Baxter gave another , less vicious poke at the lobsters and moved the kettle farther back on the stove . " I have n't had too much occasion for dreaming dreams in my life , " she said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at folks that do . Well , go on with this queer dream of the parson 's . " " That 's just it , " my mother said , her voice trembling . " It is a dream , and I know it . It 's only another of his lovely ambitions which he 's had all his life . But if it 's cruel to shatter ambitions and dreams like Ansie 's , which belong to the real world , then it must be even more cruel to tear them to pieces when they 're in the world of one 's faith , in the place where one really lives . I 'm saying it very badly , I know , Mrs. Baxter , but my husband is always somewhere in an ideal world which just plain , ordinary people like you and me ca n't reach . He just does n't see evil and confusion and selfishness , or if he ever does , he thinks we can all make things perfect or at least less imperfect , if we only believe that we can . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really why we lovep177him as we do . " She hesitated for a moment . Now that Mrs. Baxter was not occupied with the lobsters , but looking straight at my mother , conversation was more difficult . " There 's another thing that perhaps I ought to try to explain , " she concluded . " I do n't think I 'm really being quite fair to him . This is n't all just a dream . It 's more than that . It 's  --  it 's a conviction that God ca n't work out His purposes without us  --  I mean without people who have faith in Him . It 's a kind of obligation as well as merely a dream . Maybe it 's even a dedication  --  I do n't know , though I 've lived with it all these years . So now perhaps you can see , Mrs. Baxter , that if I tell him he ca n't try to help these people and that he 's just as mad as they are with his impossible hopes and longings to make the world better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  think  --  I can . " She put her hands again against her face , and to Mrs. Baxter 's and my utter distress we saw tears begin to trickle down below their palms . I was at a complete loss as to what to do , but Mrs. Baxter rose at that awful moment to her full stature as a human soul . Though her hair was as tight as ever and her cheeks as firm , I could fairly see her insides softening and crumbling beneath her stout shoulders and her firm calico-covered chest . She said nothing until she had hurriedly filled the teakettle with fresh water and put it on the hottest part of the stove in place of the lobsters . Then she advanced upon my mother with a clean dish towel for a handkerchief , pulled her hands from her face , and put her strong arms around her . " You poor , forlorn little mite ! " she said . " Now do n't you go taking on another second . I guess you 've had your worrisomemoments , and I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not so weak-minded as I sometimes seem.  |p178We  'll just bear up together , with all these dreams and fandangoes of your husband 's . When 's this Roman emperor due ? " " I would n't know , " my mother said , drying her eyes on the dish towel . " I do n't really know anything except what my husband wants . You 've been wonderful about it , Mrs. Baxter . I did so hate to tell you . " " What about that Betsy Ross woman ? " Mrs. Baxter asked , a trifle curtly perhaps , for she was clearly embarrassed by this unwonted display of genuine emotion in her kitchen . " Is she likely to come in her turn ? I ca n't say I 'm exactly eager to see her . " " I am , " I said feebly from the edge of the table , since I felt distinctly out of the picture at the moment . " She sounds the nicest of them all to me . " Neither of them paid any attention , however , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before we 're through with this mess , " my mother said . " My husband has n't named her definitely , but I 've learned never to be surprised at anything he gets into his head . " Mrs. Baxter began assembling the tea tray . " I 'm just a dight puzzled as to what to say to folks , " she said . " At church , for instance . Suppose folks get nosy as to who these people are ? " " I do n't think we need to say anything , " my mother said , " except that we have  --  guests . Wo n't that do ? " " Maybe , " Mrs. Baxter said . " Maybe not . We 'll just have to wait and see . Now you take this nice cup of tea to the sitting-room and keep calm in your mind . In the meantime I 'll bust up these lobsters . And let 's not go looking for more trouble than we 've got already . " Once my mother had gone into the sitting-room with her tea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minds . I helpedp179her break up the lobsters or at least pick the meat from them , after she had demolished their shells with a hammer . She was still too agitated to cope with the claws , which for reasons of thrift she usually insisted on splitting , but which she now gave to me to chew . As we worked , she took me into her confidenceabout a far lesser matter than the one which had so recently engaged our attention . " When you get a real good chance , " she said , " and not before , you might give your mother this sixty-nine cents . It 's change from a dollar bill . Your father forgot to pick it up from the counter when he bought some oatmeal yesterday . Mr. Wood from the store gave it to me last night . I really do n't think your father is any too capable about the family shopping . " " I 'm sure he is n't , " I said in my most adult manner . " Well , " Mrs. Baxter said loyally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let 's contrive to keep him away from the grocery store if it 's at all possible . " Mary and I often reminded each other years afterward , when she was married and living in the Berkshire Hills of Massachusetts and we had been telling bedtime stories to her children about our own childhood both in Saintsbury and in Pepperell , that if our father , after Mr. Wheeler 's weekend with us , had been like almost anyone else in the world , not only the summer of 1903 but the future in general would doubtless have been different for us all . " But he just was n't like anyone else , " one of us alwayssaid , " and I suppose , all in all , we ought to be glad he was n't . " " Johnny and Hilda always think we had a much nicerchildhood than they 're getting , " Mary said . " It 's lucky thatone generation of children can never understand just what anp180earlier generation was like  --  I mean what actually happened inside their minds . And still I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones . " Usually at some point like this she had to go indoors or to call dire threats to Johnny and Hilda , who were taking their time to go to sleep . When this happened , I sat in the garden and listened to the whippoorwills wheezing away in the nearby thickets . " Do you like these wretched birds ? " I asked once , when she had either reappeared or paused in her warnings to the children . " No , I hate them , especially now with Bill in France , but he adores them . He even wants to name this place Whippoorwill Hill . " She laughed . " You spoke just like mother then . Remember how everything was always wretched with her ? " " It still is , " I said . " At least it was five years ago , and you can sec how it keeps cropping up in her letters . " The whippoorwills continued to sound their sibilant , hissing , querulous notes through the darkness . " Perhaps I owe Bill to Pepperell , " Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telling each other about our childhoods , he always said that after those years in Pepperell , I ought to make an extremely adaptable wife . " I do n't know that any of us consciously adapted ourselves to Pepperell , or at all events to that extraordinary summer of 1903 . Or perhaps I should say " adjusted " in the tiresome , shabby terminology of today . Fifty years ago people were rarely made aware as they now are in a thousand inescapable ways of the necessity for adaptation or adjustment . They just took things as things came along ; and , of course , a more stable and quiet world was immeasurably helpful in thep181process . Children took things , too , partly because their parents were happily ignorant of those dangers with which now they are constantly pelted and dismayed , partly because the best of parents respected their children enough to allow them to learn what life is really like in order that they might assume its obligations with a natural robustness and buoyancy sadly mistrusted in families nowadays . At all events I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its many entanglements none of us was ever so completely enmeshed in them that every vivid detail of it was not stamped indelibly upon our consciousness and our memories . It had its consoling , reassuring features as well as its alarming ones ; and , in spite of its seeming unreality , it was real in the sense that it contributed lavishly to the richness and the mystery of human experience . Perhaps Mr. Henry Adams Wheeler , our first guest from the asylum , was an unfortunate choice , but we were not made aware of that fact until the final morning of his weekend visit . My father brought him down on the train from Augusta , and Mrs. Baxter somewhat reluctantly drove Snow White over on Friday afternoon to meet them at the railway station while we anxiously awaited their arrival . When they had driven into the barn and Mrs. Baxter had left my father and Mr. Wheeler to the unharnessing of Snow White and the other chores , we all made for the kitchen except Ansie , who ran out to offer his services . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Quiet as a mouse , " she said . " A very nice man far 's I can see . Just like anyone else and real interesting in his talk . Not a thing to get flustered up about . Thanks for setting the table and getting supper ready . " Mr. Wheeler was a tall , thin man of some sixty years with large , dark , and rather troubled eyes . My mother told myp182father in the few minutes which they had together while Mr. Wheeler was straightening out his belongings upstairs that she thought his eyes looked resentful , but my father said they were merely thoughtful . He was " soft-spoken , " in Mrs. Baxter 's term , slow and dignified in his speech . He had little to say at supper except about his ancestry ; and my mother in her anxiety to make him feel at home and the centre of interest really pressed him into telling us a good deal about his family history . He came from two fine New England families , he said , the Adamses and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first-named , which had contributed so many presidents to the United States and so many foreign ambassadors , statesmen , and authors that he had lost track of them . The Wheelers had not been so spectacular , he added , but they had , all the same , played their parts well on the American scene . " The famous poetess , Ella Wheeler Wilcox , is a second cousin of mine , " he said . " I wrote to her some time ago recalling the relationship , but she has not as yet replied to my letter , though Dr. Thomas thought it courteous and not presuming in any way . " " Poets are awfully busy people , I 'm sure , " Mary said . Mr. Wheeler smiled kindly at her . " That 's very likely , " he replied . " I have not yet despaired of hearing from her . And there are always the Adamses . They are almost a dynasty , in the imperial sense , I mean . " " You 've taught a great deal , my husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not too happily . " Yes , for many years , " Mr. Wheeler said , " in more schoolsand colleges than I could easily name . My subject was ancienthistory , with an emphasis on that of the Roman Empire . " " How about a walk after supper ? " my father said . " I wantyou to see my lambs . Mr. Wheeler is very fond of animals , "  |p183he  added in an explanatory note to us all . " I love animals , plants , all things in a state of nature , " Mr. Wheeler said quietly , and largely to himself . My father told us afterward that Mr. Wheeler 's knowledge of Roman history , which they talked about in his study later in the evening , was really quite phenomenal . He was entirely familiar with Caesar 's campaigns in Gaul , Hadrian 's elaborate building projects not only in Rome but in Britain and the other provinces , and the persecutions of Nero and Domitian . " He truly knew just what he was talking about , " my father said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Saturday morning , for trout in the morning and for flounders on the full tide in the afternoon ; in the evening they talked again about ancient Rome ; and on Sunday , after he had gone to church and behaved quite like anyone else , Mrs. Baxter said , he spent the afternoon in the barn . Snow White evidentlyheld a fascination for him . Ansie reported with some excitement at four o'clock when my father was just up from his afternoon nap , with which he indulged himself on Sunday in view of prayer meeting in the evening , that Mr. Wheeler had not only curried and brushed her well , but had completely scrubbed her with soap and water . " She looks wonderful , " Ansie said , " but I think you 'd best have a look , father . She 's not used to being washed , and she seems uneasy to me . " Snow White was uneasy . Perhaps in those odd perceptions granted to animals she had sensed more about Mr. Wheeler than we had . He had tied her for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she was straining at her ropes and kicking about in protest . Mr. Wheeler suggested that he ride her bareback about the pasture in order to dry her better in the sun and wind , but he desisted willingly from his planp184upon my father 's disapproval . Instead , they put her back in her stall , where after a few carrots and lumps of sugar she quieted down . At Mrs. Baxter 's sacrificial offer she entertained our guest while we were at prayer meeting , where my mother , who usually heartily disliked that Sunday evening service , was clearly relieved and delighted to have us children under her wing in the front pew . When we reached home , Mrs. Baxter reassured her further . Mr. Wheeler had gone to bed after a short walk in the pasture and an hour 's talk with her in the kitchen over raspberry shrub and cake . " About blueberries , " Mrs. Baxter said . " Blueberries ? " questioned my mother . " Whyever blue-berries ? " " He 's got all sorts of new ideas about them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he 's quite a prophet . He claims that in fifty years blueberries will grow as big as grapes and make fortunes for folks here who own these rocky old pastures . ' T was all blueberries . He never so much as mentioneda Roman emperor . " " I told you all , " my father said with a somewhat irritating complacency , " that he was a most intelligent and farseeing man . " Mrs. Baxter looked thoughtful and , to my mother 's quick eyes , apprehensive . " I 'm sure you 're right , sir , " she said . " He 's both . And that 's just why I ca n't see how it comes that I 've felt squirmy all day about him . I ca n't put my finger on a thing , and I keep telling myself there 's not the least reason , but I 'm still squirmy . " " I 'll just go up and see if he wants anything , " my father said . He came downstairs a few minutes later to report that allp185was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window enjoying the stars and the late June evening . He wanted nothing , he told my father , except his own thoughts . Mr. Wheeler rose at dawn the next morning . Mrs. Baxter , aroused by the sound of his bare feet stealthily descending the back stairs and now overcome by her squirminess , dressed quickly . By the time she had reached the side door , however , on her way to the barn , she decided to call my father . Mr. Wheeler had again tied Snow White on either side of the entrance to the barn , where she was trying her best to free herself by rearings and stampings . He was on her back and with a pitchfork , which he had evidently mistaken for a lance or a spear , raised high in his right hand was proclaiming loudly that he was one of the Caesars making ready for his triumph through the streets of Rome . He had no clothes on whatever except for Snow White 's tattered blanket which he had draped across his shoulders , apparently in the illusion that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which of the Caesars poor Mr. Wheeler was impersonating . He sent Mrs. Baxter hurrying down the road for the village doctor , fortunately both a Methodist and a friend ; and together he and the doctor persuaded Mr. Wheeler to dismount and to dress himself in the clothing procured by Mrs. Baxter from his room . He was not at all violent or even rebellious . He was , instead , like a child who at the last moment has been forbidden to put on a carefully prepared show , or like a playwright who has seen his cherished drama fold up after the first night because of lack of popular understanding and acclaim . When he realized that my father and the doctor were planning to take him back at once to the asylum , he neither questioned their decision nor showed any signs of regret . Perhaps in the confused world of his mind such a decision meant more clarity andp186order than he was capable of achieving by himself and was , therefore , not unwelcome to him . While these proceedings were taking place in the barn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sittingroomwatching from the windows or just staring at one another in disbelief . Or , more accurately , Mary , Ansie , and I were watching and reporting from time to time to my mother , who was actually far beyond any of these activities . She looked so indifferent and abstracted , so quiet and sad , that I felt worried about her even in the midst of such unparalleled goings-on . A long time afterward , when in the process of growing up I had discovered more clearly certain things for myself , she tried to tell me  --  in England it was  --  just how far removed she had been that morning from things that were happening and how , just because she had been far removed , many other things happened later on . For she had suddenly found herself in that rare , salutary , and lonely state of mind when one accepts the imperfect just because there is nothing that human desire or human pity can do to make it any different from what it is . Of course , in lesser ways most thoughtful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some treasured house or piece of country , the frailties and defects in ourselves as well as in those we most love , the imperfections of language in which one 's thoughts are formed , but can never be entirely conveyed . Yet to accept the imperfect in the nature of life itself , to come face to face with injustice and tragedy , accident , irony , and pathos , and to know by some ruthless , quickening understanding , mingled with a wise , restrained fury toward things as they are , that one is forever caught among them and helpless against them  --  this acceptance and knowledge are quite another matter . If my mother had been merely indignant and angry at my father as she had been in timesp187past and was often to be in the future , I doubt if we should ever have known any other of his friends at the asylum . But , since such superficial emotions were for the time being lost in this dark , yet clear vision of life itself which was inundating her as my father with the doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of her quite practical and rational defenses against his ideas and hopes had suffered a shattering blow . Although , with that inconsistency which , in the course of mediocre events , makes havoc of all our revelations , my mother was to forget , or at least to set aside , that flash of understanding granted her on the morning of Mr. Wheeler 's departure , I have always felt sure it was responsible for her willingness a month afterward to assent to Mrs. Nesbit 's visit . At all events she came in August after the hay had been cut and gathered in and the goldenrod had begun to fill the thickets and to border the roadsides . My mother and Mrs. Baxter accepted her with wary resignation ; we children with curiosity ; my father as always with fresh hope . I do n't think that any of us experienced a shift in these emotions during the week except that the resignation lost its wariness , the curiosity was never satisfied , and the hope , since it found no tangible cause for diminishment , at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no ground whatevereither for alarm or for acute embarrassment , she exacted a heavy toll simply by her imposition of an atmosphere which so surrounded us all that it became an enclosure , an encirclement , all but a blockade . This atmosphere was silence , not the silence of contemplation or of meditation , of reverie or reflection , but merely an almost complete absence of human utterance . Until the last night of her stay with us Mrs. Nesbitp188literally never spoke except in occasional single words , which ranged from pleased comments to equally pleasant and sometimesstartling ejaculations . All of us , I am sure , revised our opinions concerning the value of silence during Mrs. Nesbit 's visit , each , of course , according to age and experience . From a solacing , reanimating gift , not only extolled by poets and philosophers , but welcomed by all quite ordinary human beings , it became during that week a harrowing , nerve-racking , even peculiarly sinister environment . Although there was nothing tangibly threateningabout it , it assumed the nature of a lowering , unpredictable cloud or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was fraught with problems which baffled solution , was frustrating beyond description . Yet in its essence , that is , in so far as Mrs. Nesbit herself generated its character , it was calm , harmless , quite free from any esoteric translation . We were clearly its misinterpreters , and still we were its unwilling , thwarted , perplexed prisoners . Whether Mrs. Nesbit was at all conscious of her silence we never knew , for she gave no sign . Nor did she seem in the least aware that it was causing any uneasiness or distress . She was like some small boat floating on a flat , unruffled sea , in the vast depths of which currents swirl and undertows surge , but which on its surface betrays none of these agitations . It had been in the hope of discovering those disturbances , which at some time in the past had wrecked the frail craft of Mrs. Nesbit 's life , that her sojourn with us had been encouraged ; but no such discoveries were made . She never evaded questions ; she simply disregarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , we never knew . She was a tiny , middle-aged woman , so small-boned and fragile that she seemed shadowy . She crept about like a shadow , too , suddenly appearing in a doorway or on thep189stairs and startling one quite unreasonably , for like any other shadow she gave the impression of lacking all corporeal substance . So far as one could gather , she was completely selfsufficient . In whatever world she dwelt it was apparently peaceful and untroubled . She had a vague , kind , benevolent face which never changed its expression of silent pleasure . She had delicate manners , too , as though she had once been well brought up , and a marked fastidiousness about her clothing and general appearance . She acquiesced wordlessly in all that we asked or expected of her . If one of us proposed a walk , she went happily , flitting about the fields or pastures like some small butterfly in the sun ; if she helped Mrs. Baxter shell peas or remove the strings from beans in the kitchen , she worked quickly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though such co-operation were the most charming of occupations ; if my father took her on a drive , as he frequently did to ease the growing tension in the house , she sat beside him , impassive , smiling , speechless . On the first of these hushed excursions we children went along in the back seat , since my mother said that my father was himself becoming nervous and uncertain and that we could lend him support . " Talk , " she said as we started for the carriage in which Mrs. Nesbit was already quietly sitting . " Do n't forget to talk . Just talk as you always do . Never mind if she does n't say a word . " This was without doubt simple and wise advice , and we did our utmost to carry out her wishes ; but we were vanquishedbefore we had gone a quarter of a mile . I called attention to some early autumn colouring ; Mary reminded us all that school was but four weeks away ; Ansie saw and communicated briefly the presence of a squirrel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips , snatched all efforts from our minds , settled down over us like some heavy , invisible blanket . My father , too , became swathed in its folds although he did his utmost now and again to emerge from them . " Were you born in New England , Mrs. Nesbit ? " he asked , as we began slowly to ascend a hill . A wood thrush answered him from a nearby thicket . " It 's late for a thrush , " my father said . " Too early for migrating , too late for song . " He turned sharply around to stare at us all , disapproval together with a plea for help in his eyes . " Yes , " we said in unison , avoiding his gaze , ashamed of our absurd inability to help him . Snow White 's iron shoes clanged against the stones of the road . One of the wheel axles , wanting oil , whined . We rumbled slowly across a corduroy bridge above a swift stream . " Brook ! " cried Mrs. Nesbit in delight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's mouth flew open ; Ansie looked white . " Yes , " my father said in almost equal delight . " A brook to fish in . Did you ever fish for trout , Mrs. Nesbit , when you were a little girl ? " We went on up the hill . Then we went down another hill . We stopped at a roadside spring to give Snow White a drink . The afternoon sun flecked the water with gleams of light . " Let 's sing something , Ansie , " my father said . " We often sing on drives , " he explained to Mrs. Nesbit , whose face did not alter from its empty , rather winning smile . " I do n't feel like singing , " Ansie said . He looked whiter . " Nonsense ! " said my father sternly . " Let 's sing Annie Laurie . ' "  |p191He  began with the first words , " Maxwelton 's braes are bonnie . " When he realized that Ansie was not joining him , he turned quickly around , ready with reproof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he saw that Ansie was being quietly sick over the wheel . After that episode Mrs. Baxter only accompaniedmy father on any drives taken for Mrs. Nesbit 's entertainment . Mrs. Baxter was , in point of fact , a veritable anchor to windward throughout that long , memorable week . Her hold on things never slackened . Nor was her stout moral sense outraged when we discovered that any respect for the possessions of others had left Mrs. Nesbit , perhaps at that undiscoverable time when so many other qualities had taken their leave of her . By observation or intuition she had ascertainedthe drawer in the kitchen chest where Mrs. Baxter kept her starched white aprons . These apparently fascinated her , for she began removing them one by one to her room and stowing them away in the canvas case in which she had brought her belongings . When my mother , bent on redeemingthem , inspected her room while she was with my father , or sitting silently in the orchard , or placidly wandering about the field and pasture , she discovered several other unrelated objects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a ball of Ansie 's , one of my hair ribbons , a spool of bright thread . We had no means of knowing whether Mrs. Nesbit resented or even noticed this reclamation . She continued to gather in , my mother to retrieve . The weather held fair throughout her stay , in itself a blessing since silence without was less oppressive than silence within . We even went on several picnics , which Mrs. Baxter not only tolerated but proposed in spite of her considered opinion that they were untidy indulgences . Mrs. Nesbit accepted them all with mute equanimity . Infrequently , butp192always to my father 's waning encouragement , she said " Sea gull ! " or " Sailboat ! " and invariably with the appearance of mild surprise and happiness . One day when we were fishing from an abandoned pier she hooked a flounder , which Ansie , seeing her line taut and trembling , drew in for her ; but she remained imperturbable in the midst of our lavish and vicarious congratulation . During her last evening with us we all sat in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for some days previously suggested various other occupations for us children , and Mrs. Baxter was constantly inventing excuses for our absence ; but either from a sense of loyalty to my father or from mere curiosity we usually managed to remain within the family circle . Perhaps because of the assurance of freedom on the morrow we found ourselves more able to talk with some degree of naturalness . My father and Mrs. Baxter reviewed seriously the best candidates for a Methodist conference in Bangor ; my mother , Mary , and I made plans for Mary 's birthday , which would fall in late September ; Ansie in his turn rehearsed a recent letter from Katie descriptive of two swans which unexpectedly had taken up their residence on my grandfather 's small stream . Mrs. Nesbit in the gatheringdarkness smiled on . Suddenly the orchard grass and the air above it became punctuated with intermittent glints of light . " Fireflies ! " cried Mrs. Nesbit . There was more than pleasure in her voice ; there was rapture , as though the glimmering , darting flashes were illuminatingsome more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She slipped from the bench where she was sitting between my father and Mrs. Baxter and began stealing about in the grass and reaching into the air for the fireflies . She was like some child who wakens in the night andp193gropes toward the thread of light beneath his door which promises safety and companionship outside . She was laughing in odd little ripples of sound as she ran hither and thither under the trees . Now we were the silent ones as we collided with one another , snatching after the elusive flickerings ; but we all helped her to catch the fireflies which even in our hands still flashed and glowed . Ansie ran to the house to fetch a box for them . When we had caught a good number , Mrs. Baxter said : " Let 's take them to the kitchen and put them under a bit of glass . I think they light up just the same , inside as out . " " Let 's , " Mrs. Nesbit said , with genuine excitement . They did light up just the same . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Mrs. Baxter had blown out the kitchen lamp , we all stood about the table and watched them glowing in the darkness so brightly that all our faces bending above them were brought now and again into sharp , fleeting relief . The fireflies had succeeded whereas we had failed ; for as Mrs. Nesbit watched them , entranced , she continued to laugh and to look happily at each of us in the fitful gleams of light . She was transfigured , radiant , a new creature . I felt all at once as though I were going to cry . Ansie was the practical one among us . " You can take them back with you tomorrow , Mrs. Nesbit , " he said . " I 'll put some grass in their box so they 'll feel more at home . I 'm sure they 'll keep on sparkling in the night . " " Thank you , Ansie , " Mrs. Nesbit said . " Thank you very much . " She looked smaller and more fragile than ever in the evanescent gleams , her narrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bones in her clasped fingers , which she had raised to her face , twitching like little sticks.  |p194Yet  she did not seem shadowy any longer even in the halfdarkness . The vagueness had left her eyes , and her empty , ceaseless smile had been vanquished by her laughter . " Thank you , all , " she said . The next night when Mrs. Baxter was getting supper , she reached for the glass saucedish in the kitchen cupboard in order to put some preserves in it . It was not there . We never saw it again . I think that the most memorable thing about Mrs. Gowan among many memorable things was the way she widened her eyes as though she had never seen before just what she was looking at , as though she were continually in a state of primeval , boundless surprise . She always did this upon greeting a person whether familiar or unfamiliar to her , and it had the effect of making one feel of importance . She did it , too , again and again , while she was listening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all unusual , an odd seashell , a bird 's nest , a scurrying sandpiper . Perhaps her eyes themselves lent significance to this distinctivetrait or mannerism . They were long rather than round eyes and of a rather pale , yet clear blue . They had a shining , innocent quality like those of a happy child . Whenevershe widened them in this singular way her eyebrows , which were high and quite beautifully shaped , rose , too , and gave puckers to her forehead , or , more accurately , deepened those already there . This way of looking at people and things lent her an air of almost constant astonishment ; and yet together with it and seemingly at complete variance to it she emanated an atmosphere of tranquillity and assurance  --  an atmosphere usually characteristic only of those few persons who havep195managed somehow to know satisfaction in its most basic , substantial forms or else who by some rare power or gift denied to most of us have been able to reach some mysterious mental and emotional citadel where fears no longer exist . Nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect , given her environment over many years . It was insteadpositive and vibrant , as though she had spent her mature life grappling with the pros and the cons of abstract ideas and theories and had at last come to an honest or at least workable conclusion about them . My father once said to me , some years afterward when he and my mother had returned to England , that he never saw a shorn , harvested Suffolk wheat field , lying quiet beneath an autumn twilight , without being reminded in an odd way of Mrs. Gowan . There were no discernible aspects about Mrs. Gowan 's earlier life as we learned about it from her in the late summer of 1903 which could account either for her serenity or for her attitude of gay , quickening surprise . Serenity had been entirelyabsent from it ; and , although it had richly furnished her with violent surprises , its rudeness and turbulence could hardly have produced that sense of artless wonder with which she viewed the world in her old age . It was as impossible to discover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what she was as it was impossible to forget them . I think , in fact , that they were in large measure responsible for my mother 's surprising invitation to Mrs. Gowan to visit us which she extended once she had met Mrs. Gowan in Augusta . Such an invitation was surely absent from her mind , indeed anathema to it , at the close of Mrs. Nesbit 's sojourn . Like most other reasonable persons in a similar situation she 11 id decided that we had had quite enough of my father 's experiments in hope and faith ; yet I can not honestly say that reasonableness in any form characterized her behaviour duringp196a most complicated and embarrassing week at the end of August . Whimsical and volatile by nature , she was given to swinging capriciously from one mood to another , and now she swung with no discretion whatever to the outer limits of vexation and resentment . She forgot or pushed aside the sorrowful burden of human knowledge which Mr. Wheeler had afforded her and the fitful light of the fireflies beneath the saucedish on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her particular captivity , just as she forgot or chose to disregard her earlier resolution to co-operate with my father . For fully seven days she was captious , indignant , and irritable , to use but the kindest of adjectives . My father , looking like a child who is bewildered by the illogical and quibbling censures of upbraiding parents , took daily to trout fishing ; we children sought for diversion anywhere but at home ; Mrs. Baxter was puzzled and anxious. " 1 would n't wonder a mite but what she 's close on to hy-sterics , " she said to Mary and me one evening at the close of this harrowing week while we were helping her with the dishes , all of us uncomfortably aware of ominous silence throughout the house . Ansie had long since disappeared . " No , she is n't , " Mary said . " She never has  --  those . " I knew she was politely refraining from the correct pronunciation of Mrs. Baxter 's noun . " You should have seen her on that horrible steamship , Mrs. Baxter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you must admit that father can be  --  well , difficult . " " Your father , " Mrs. Baxter said , pausing to rinse the dishes with more boiling water than was necessary , " is the best man I 've ever known in my whole life . " " I know that , of course , " Mary said . She stood with a cup in her left hand and the dish towel in her right . She was looking at neither Mrs. Baxter nor me , but staring dreamily197at nothing . Then she said slowly , " I often hope I 'll not marry someone just like father . " I have never forgotten the shock which my sister 's words gave me . I suddenly felt lonely and lost as though she had travelled to a strange country , leaving me in the worn , familiar one , with some dark , impassable gulf between them . I dropped my dish towel in my confusion . Mrs. Baxter hurriedlygave me a clean one from the rack above the sink . Then she looked quizzically at Mary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of getting married ? " she asked . " I do n't think so , " Mary said calmly , still staring at invisiblewonders in her new world . " Eventually , girls do get married , Mrs. Baxter . " At just that moment when I thought I could n't go on with the dish-drying and when even Mrs. Baxter was at a stupefied loss for speech , my mother burst into the kitchen . She was as merry as she was excited . " Where 's your father ? " she asked Mary and me . Mrs. Baxter answered her . " I have a notion he 's in the pasture , " she said . " I saw him setting out for a walk . It appears to me he 's got a lot on his mind . " " I 'm sure he has , " my mother said lightly , as she started for the side door . " So have I. I 've just now decided that I 'm going with him next week on his September visit to that asylum . He 's asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things for myself . I 'll go find him and break the news . " It must have taken some time to apprise my father of her quixotic decision , for darkness had fallen long before they returned , their feet drenched with dew , their faces calm and shining . Everybody but me had a most welcome reunion over our evening tea ; and I pretended to , difficult as it was . Ansiep198could n't believe his eyes and ears when he saw and heard us all laughing and talking and knew that he could now describe the huge kite he had been making in readiness for the next high northwest winds after the August dog days . I did n't stay in the same bed with Mary that night . Once I was sure that she was sound asleep , I stole up the steep stairs to the attic where there was a tiny , unfinished room with a cot in it . What with my mother 's petulance and my father 's distress , with Mr. Wheeler 's thwarted triumph and Mrs. Nesbit 's silence , with Ansie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , far beyond all these , yet heaviest in my aching heart , my sister 's new , idiotic , and perilous dreams which made us strangers to each other , I felt so tempesttossedand desolate that , I told myself , I required complete solitude even at the cost of rough dark rafters and probable spiders . I felt bitterly disappointed when I awoke in the morning not only to find my griefs less painful but to realize that 1 had fallen asleep before I had had time for appropriate misery.  |p199I  suppose Mrs. Baxter 's treatment of us during our parents ' five days ' absence in Augusta might well be described as therapeutic in the modern term . I have often since wished I could have been inside her mind when she planned it , for I am sure it was the result of deep and secretive design arising from her conviction that we had recently seen quite too much of the darker side of life . It was certainly restorative in every particular as well as healing and curative in its complete freedom from any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , for she threw all cautions , both physical andeconomic , to the brisk , clear September winds and gave us , as the first of her remedial ministrations , so much to eat that we were in a perpetual state of overstuffing . Our five days , by common and tacit consent , were prayerless . Instead , at a late and leisurely breakfast we consumed mounds of hot pancakes drenched in maple syrup . For dinner we had succulent clams fried in egg batter or pot roast thick with gravy ; for supper , prodigious slabs of hot blueberry cake yellow with fresh butter . There were all manner of pies , apple , blueberry , lemon , pumpkin , custard , for every meal , steamed puddings at noon and at night , and in the interims sizzling doughnuts dipped from a kettle of boiling lard . Mrs. Baxter was skeptical about the doughnuts , perhaps even guilty , since she knew my mother was given to questioningthem . She warned us as she ladled them from the fat that they had been known to cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in too great number . We gobbled them just the same and had no fits . Much as we loved our parents , it was really a wonderful span of relaxation , with the opening of school just around the corner . Along with her riotous indulgence in food Mrs. Baxter entered into our doings with an abandon which amazed us all . We dug our clams together at low tide , going out so far on the shaky flats to get the big ones that we sank our feet into the mud and slime without a word of disapproval from her ; indeed , since she was far heavier , she sank far deeper and always with great good humour . We fished for flounders from an actual dory which she borrowed and rowed a good distance out in the harbour like a seasoned mariner ; and once we had brought our bountiful catch home and she had dexterously filleted them , she dotted them with cloves before frying them , after a secret recipe of her ownp200hitherto untried in the parsonage . She harnessed Snow White and took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the field with an utter disregard of the second growth of grass and sang all manner of songs as we watched it sailing carelesslyhigh overhead . Mary forgot her silly fancies , and Ansie forsook all the boys of the neighbourhood , if not for me personally , at least for our combined and unexpected camaraderie . This became in fact so dependent and hilarious that we fetched Lilla as a foursome in the late afternoon and , while Mrs. Baxter expertly milked her , we three stood about watching . When she skillfully squirted some streams of warm milk into Ansie 's mouth , we thought it the most amusing thing we had ever seen and rocked with laughter . In the evenings we all played parchesi at the kitchen table until long past our usual bedtime . In the place of the counters Mrs. Baxter surprised us yet again by substituting coloured lozenges , a silly innovation which afforded us immensedelight , especially since the winner was given all the lozenges as stakes while fresh ones miraculously appeared for the following games . When the clock startled us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made quarts of rich cocoa which she complemented with delectable , fruity confections called " hermits . " As we reluctantly departed for bed on the final night of this boisterous and unbridled holiday , we all , prompted by Ansie , threw our arms around her and kissed her good night . She looked startled and perhaps a trifle culpable , but I think she was pleased . " It 's a relief to think just about yourself for a time at least , is n't it ? " Mary said to me as we undressed . " I mean , not even to want to do good to anyone at all . " I was too full of cocoa , hermits , and grateful astonishment over our incomparable five days to answer her.  |p201My  mother made it abundantly clear from the moment of their return home that Mrs. Gowan 's visit was at her own suggestion , without any urging whatsoever from my father ; in fact , she had previously conveyed this information in a letter to Mrs. Baxter which had not been shared with us doubtless because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fall upon her program of events for our entertainment while she was in sole charge of us . As it turned out , she need not have had the least misgiving . There was nothing in any way shadowy about Mrs. Gowan . She was , on the contrary , substantial , tangible , real . She was neither fragile like Mrs. Nesbit nor broodingly reflective after the manner of Mr. Wheeler . Although she was not far from eighty years old , she gave every impression of being twenty years younger . She was of average size and height , quick and eager in all her motions . She carried her head high and slightly inclined toward the left , a position which lent a certain archness to her appearance . She was genial , outgoing , gracious . And yet she possessed in her almost unlined , mobile face an expression of grave serenity , suffused , as I have said , by a kind of perpetual surprise and excitement like the sunlight of Indian summer streaming across some quiet , contained landscape ready and waiting for winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measureless capacity for acute enjoymentas well as the power to convey that pleasure to others ; yet unlike many prodigal persons she was never irksome or exhausting . She was rarely averse to talking , which she did exceedingly well ; but she was quite contented to sit quiet for hours in the sitting-room or the kitchen busy with her American flags or willingly setting them aside to help myp202mother or Mrs. Baxter with the family mending . Warned by my father about her Betsy Ross world , we expected her to retreat there often . As a matter of fact , such excursions were rare and could usually be circumvented if one of us thought of an interesting story or proposed a fresh activity . When they did occur and she told us about General Washington 's request to her to design the national standard , she made everything seem so normal and actual that we easily found ourselves , too , in Philadelphia in the year 777 . I have always cherished my own perhaps perverse ideas about Mrs. Gowan 's retirements from what is known as the real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selfdeceptions , and delusions some thirty years before we knew her had been serious , even violent enough to make necessary her commitment to the hospital . There had , indeed , been every reason for her desperate invention of another sphere in which to live . And yet I am inclined to think that her translations of herself into Betsy Ross and her hurried journeys to Philadelphia and brief stays there were in large measure , at least during her visits to us , excitements and indulgences , especially since with us she had no real desire for escape ; nor have I ever been convinced that the purely histrionic offerings of such behaviour did not possess their appeal to her . She had many of the qualities usually attributed to an actress . She was a genius at storytelling , throwing herself with gestures and even mimicry into her recitals . She had a quick , true sense of dramatic moments and effects . She loved to dance in games with us children and took unquenchable delight in the country rhymes which my father remembered from his Suffolk boyhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ansie sang and in which she loved to join , her thin , quavering voice often failing on the higher notes and causing her gay , even quite riotous laughter.  |p203I  think I remember her best during our afternoons in the orchard , for in the fine September weather we had our tea there , once we had discovered how she rejoiced in it , how she threw her whole being into every feature of it : Ansie 's hungry eyes staring at Mrs. Baxter 's frosted cupcakes ; my father 's relaxation in a long canvas chair recently given him by his friend , the doctor ; my mother 's assembling of the cups and saucers and her cordial voice saying , " I know you like it good and strong , Mrs. Gowan , just like me . " She had a passion for gathering flowers to make wreaths for us all , her fingers as nimble at this occupation as with her needle ; and when we were all there during the bright late afternoons she would crown each of us with her handiwork  --  some garlands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; a rakish coronet of goldenrod for Mrs. Baxter 's severe head ; some lacy white asters for my mother ; and always for my father a circlet of red leaves , which above his quiet , serious face afforded her a delighted sense of contrast . There are rare times and occasions in the experience of everyone when things for the moment seem entirely good and right , when life halts on its burdened , inexorable way , when anxieties fade and fears are not . Such , I have always thought , were the hours with Mrs. Gowan in our orchard . Her joy at being among us was so simple , primitive , and uncluttered that we all responded as though we were dwelling in the earliest ages of some ingenuous , single-minded , undesigning world . My father seemed almost transfigured during these hours as though , after countless disappointments and disillusionments , he were at long last realizing the truths upon which he had staked his all . Yet he was never so far away in his shining realms of renewed faith and confidence that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , early in Mrs. Gowan 's initial visit , when he looked particularly wanton and indecorous with the red maple leaves of her wreath fluttering above his eyebrows , he unearthedan old English poem or ballad , which he said he had not recalled for years but which he thought particularly suited to us all at the moment . It was one , he told us , that the children in his country school at home used to say in unison , clapping their hands as they did so . It might be even centuries old , he said , and never written down at all , just recited from one generation of children to another . My mother , I could see , had some misgivings as he began to repeat it ; but once she saw Mrs. Gowan 's unrestrained delight in it , she smiled , too , beneath her own wreath of asters . There was a mad man and he had a mad wife , And they lived in Ding Dong Dell . They had three children , all at one birth , And they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mother was mad , And the children were mad beside ; And they all got on a mad white horse , And madly they did ride . They rode by night , they rode by day , Yet nary a one of them fell ; And they rode madly all the wayTill they came to the Gates of Hell . The Devil was glad to see them all madAnd gladly let them in . But he soon grew sorry to see them so merryAnd let them out again . Then God came down and said to them all , " Now come along with Me , For My House is the maddest House That you will ever see.  | " It 's so full of madness there 's no room for sadness , It 's lasted for endless years . It 's built of gladness , and Grace , and joy . There 's no room in it for tears . " My father had to recite it fully half a dozen times for Mrs. Gowan , who began to finish each line like a child memorizing nursery rhymes by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why do n't I copy it out for you , Mrs. Gowan ? " Mary said . " Then you 'll have it for keeps just in case you forget it . " " And I could copy out father 's other verses , " I said . " We could make a real copybook of them for you , Mrs. Gowan . And we could even sew and bind it in some coloured pasteboard so it would be just like a book . " A slightly wary , almost frightened look crept into Mrs. Gowan 's eyes at this mention of a book . " Thank you , " she said , " but I like better to have things in my mind . I do n't care much for reading books . " My mother looked surprised . " You speak so well that I would have thought you had read a great deal , " she said . " Oh , I have , " Mrs. Gowan said . " A very great deal . When I was young , I lived to read , perhaps partly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much now . Books bother me , even copybooks . " " Why is that ? " my father asked kindly . " I do n't just know , " Mrs. Gowan said . " Perhaps all the many words marching across all the many pages . I keep thinking of all the tiredness there was for someone writing down all those words until I get quite tired myself and maybe confused , too . And when I remember all that the words carry  --  I mean about people and all their thoughts and doings  --  well , I guess that 's why I prefer space-takers . I love space/takers . I can think about those for hours and hours . They never tire me in the least . " We all looked confused in our turn . " Just what is a space-taker ? " Mrs. Baxter asked . She was knitting a sweater for Ansie under her generous wreath of goldenrod . I knew that she felt awkward and ill at ease with the yellow plumes so absurdly on her head , and I felt especially grateful for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue eyes widened in pleased surprise that she could tell us something which we did not know . " Does n't anyone here know what a space-taker is ? " she asked importantly . " I 'm afraid not , " my father said . " We should all be grateful if you could explain one , Mrs. Gowan . " " Certainly , " Mrs. Gowan said with marked gravity . " A space-taker is what takes up a bit of space when newspaper editors are done with all the news . You see , when they have said all they have to say about fires , or murders , or parties , or folks going places , or celebrations for this and that great event , they often need to fill the little spaces that are left empty at the end of their long columns . So they just open one of their desk drawers and find a space-taker for the bare places in their newspapers . " I 'll tell you how I know so much about them . Quite a time ago an editor of a newspaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a spell . His thoughts had gone higglypigglywith all his hard work , and he had other troubling things in his life besides . He was a very nice young man , named Charley Bright . I used to talk with him a lot when we held our parties for the patients on Saturday nights , and sometimes we used to meet about the grounds . He told me all about space-takers . He had thousands and thousands of themp207all filed away ; and when he had empty spaces to fill in his newspaper he just drew several out and fitted them in . Of course , they are very different . Some just deal in facts , like Samuel de Champlain sailed along the Maine coast in September , 1604 , and named Mount Desert Island ' or Last year tornadoes killed 146 people in the United States and rattlesnakes with their deadly fangs were responsible for the death of 34 . ' No one of course would care much for those space-takers , but often there are wonderful ones like  --  well , like Socrates saying , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am a citizen of the whole wide world , ' or like Shakespeare , There 's a divinity that shapes our ends , rough-hew them how we will . ' Space-takers like those give hours of thought . Sometimes they just glow quietly in your mind , or at other times they are like those Roman candles that send out stars in all directions and make you think of a hundred things . A while ago there was a beautiful one . It said , The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me ; because the Lord hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted , to proclaim liberty to the captives , and the opening of the prison to them that are bound . ' That 's from the prophet Isaiah , though I should n't be telling that to a real parson , now , should I ? " " Of course , you should , " my father said . " Parsons need space-takers , too , and that one is my very favourite passage from the whole Bible . " Mrs. Gowan was illumined by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wreath for her own thin white hair ( for she had been too busy with framing ours to think much of herself ) she had tucked two scarlet geraniums from my mother 's front-yard flower bed , one behind either car where they glowed now against her flushed cheeks . She rose from the orchard bench and stood among us with her arms outspread as though she were garnering unnumberedp208blessings . " So that 's what a space-taker is , you see , " she said . " I learn my favourite ones every week and stow them away in my mind just as Charley Bright put them away in his drawer . And when I have empty spaces to fill , in my days , as I often do when I 'm done with the unimportant things in the hospital , I just draw them out and say one or two over to myself and fill up my own spaces with their thoughts . And , will you believe it , that nice young man , that Charley Bright , sends me his paper every week  --  just for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maine State Hospital , Augusta  --  and what is more he puts a blue line around his space-takers so I wo n't have to read the news at all . He even says , " she concluded with a shy , half-coy look around our circle , " that he chooses them now with me in his mind . " " I 'm sure he does , " my mother said , smiling first at Mrs. Gowan and then at my father in his long chair . " he 's such a nice young man , " Mrs. Gowan said , " and very handsome , too , tall and straight . I hope he stays well in his head . He said in a letter which he wrote just to me that he uses space-takers now the way I do , to fill spaces in his thoughts when all of a sudden they grow empty or muddled . And always on the folder around his newspaper addressed just to me he writes hospital . He never writes asylum . There 's such a difference in words and what they suggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , there is , " my father said quietly . " What 's one space-taker that Charley Bright chose just for you , Mrs. Gowan ? " Mary asked . " A lovely one , Mary , " Mrs. Gowan said , her eyes wide and shining . " And only in his paper just last week . It was as though he knew that I was coming to visit you . When I woke up this morning and remembered I was really here among myp209new friends , and saw the sun , I said it over to myself . It 's from Shakespeare . It says : Night 's candles are burnt out , and jocund day Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops . " " Well , if you 'll excuse me , " Mrs. Baxter said , her solid cheeks trembling a little beneath her goldenrod , " I 'll go in and tackle supper . " Since it was Mary 's turn to set the table for supper , I could stay in the orchard with the others . Mrs. Baxter seldom allowedmore than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure she consented to that much assistance only because she thought it might be good for us , not in any way for her . The September sun was low in the sky and the shadows were long upon the orchard grass . Mrs. Gowan returned to my father 's poem , which he repeated yet again for her . " I 've got it pretty well in my head now , " she said . " It 's rather long for a space-taker , but it has lots of good thoughts , especially at the close where it talks about the house of God . I like that name much better than Heaven myself . Or is that wrong of me ? " " Not in the least , " my father said . " I 've never much fancied Heaven . No one knows anything really about Heaven , but most people at times know a little about the house of God . " " I understand about gladness and joy , " Mrs. Gowan said . " I feel them both this very minute . But I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for asking you , too . Just what it this grace ? " My father looked thoughtful . Perhaps just for the moment he forgot Mrs. Gowan in the recollection of his seminary days and their hot theological disputations.  | " Grace ? " he said . " Grace ? Well , that 's very difficult to explain , Mrs. Gowan . Many learned men have thought about grace for many centuries . Most of them think it has to do with forgiveness and mercy , but I 'm inclined to disagree with them . I rather think grace means just the constant presence of God . " A puzzled , slightly bewildered look crept into Mrs. Gowan 's eyes . " I 'm glad you do n't think it means forgiveness , " she said . " I heard too much about forgiveness when I was young . God will forgive you if you pray hard enough , ' I heard , or God will never forgive you . ' I heard that , too . Forgive , forgive , forgive . I got so I hated forgiveness ! And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " I 'm sure you do n't need to worry at all about forgiveness , " my father said , coming back from the seminary and looking suddenly at my mother as though he needed her help . " Of course , you do n't , " my mother said quickly , and as carelessly as though forgiveness were not worth an instant 's consideration . " Who cares a whit about silly old forgiveness ? And is n't it nice , Mrs. Gowan , to think of God 's house being mad ? You see , madness means being merry just as the poem says  --  so merry that there 's not a bit of room for tears . That 's just what it means , is n't it ? " she asked my father abruptly with , I thought , more than a trace of accusation in her tone . " Precisely , " my father said , and hurriedly for him . " Precisely . All the people in the poem were so merry , that is , so full of grace that God had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My wife always explains things better than I can , Mrs. Gowan , as you see . And the house of God , or at least a good-sized room in it , is here , right here in this very orchard , and we are all in it . Only , Ansie , I 'm afraid you'llp211have to slip out for a few minutes to fetch Lilla for her milking . " Mrs. Gowan became radiant again . " I 'm glad to get it all straight in my mind , " she said . " And not only for myself , but for Mrs. McCarthy . She 's really why I asked you about the meaning of that word grace . " " Who 's Mrs. McCarthy ? " Ansie asked . " I 'll go in a minute , father , once I know about Mrs. McCarthy . " " Mrs. McCarthy , " Mrs. Gowan said , with the dignity she always assumed when she was asked a direct question , " is a lady in the hospital who usually has the room next to mine off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like trees and where the mountains are bluer than the many lakes and where people really believe in ghosts and fairies and elves . She 's a very special friend of mine . She 's almost always clear in her mind , quite like me , but there are times when she gets muddled up and thinks she 's back in County Kerry where sad things happened to her on account of her husband and her three sons all going out in their boats to sea . They were fishermen . Sometimes , when these spells overtake her , the doctors carry her away for a few days to do healing things to her ; and when she comes back , she always says to me , There 's not a thing left to me , Mary Gowan , but the Grace of God . ' So now I can tell her just what grace means . " " Let 's all go after Lilla , " I said , for I saw the idea stirring in my mother 's mind . " Ansie and you and me , Mrs. Gowan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gowan said , Mrs. McCarthy and the Grace of God growing dim in her new anticipation . " And I 've a plan for you all , " my mother said . " You childrenput your wreaths on Lilla 's horns and lead her home in a triumphal procession . I can hear her now lowing at the skies . ' " " We 'll do that very thing , " Mrs. Gowan cried . " Lowing atp212the skies . ' That sounds just like poetry . " " It is , " my mother said . " It 's a space-taker of mine , Mrs. Gowan . " Mrs. Gowan did not tell the story of her life in the orchard , but in the sitting-room and on one evening toward the close of her visit when she had come to feel very much at home . I am sure our parents planned it that way in the thought that we children might well not hear it . At all events after supper that night my mother sent us upstairs to do our lessons for school the next day ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wanted , she said , to read The Lady of Shalott aloud in order to memorize at least part of it more easily , I went into Ansie 's room to work with him on our arithmetic problems which had to do with wallpaper . We felt unreasonablyannoyed with Mrs. Baxter , who might well have been of help to us , but who had gone , laden with soothing custards , to visit Mrs. Kimball , in bed with what in Pepperell was known as " the quincy . " The invitation to Mrs. Gowan to tell her story was given not entirely for her sake . My father , my mother told us later when she shared with us certain carefully chosen incidents from Mrs. Gowan 's past , was prompted by what one might call , I suppose , a professional reason . He already knew about her life from Dr. Thomas and the records at the hospital ; but both he and the doctor were anxious to see whether her own recital of it tallied exactly with the records or varied from them in any particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I , from his room at the right of the stairs leading from the sitting-room , could hear the fire crackling in the fireplacethere , for it was a chilly evening . Although my mother had discreetly closed Ansie 's door earlier , he had just as dis/creetly opened it , lowering his lamp as he did so . We both felt it quite impossible to settle down at his table with the hateful rolls of wallpaper , measured by a Mr. A. and ready to be put on walls by a Mr. B. , who was relying upon us to determine just how many rolls he would need in view of the many windowscutting up the space . We could hear also my father 's quiet voice beginning to encourage Mrs. Gowan . " There 's so much about your girlhood that we just do n't know , Mrs. Gowan , " he was saying . " You 've learned so much about us during your visit that we 'd like to know more about you , that is , if you 'd care to tell us . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , perhaps a trifle hesitantly . I am sure Ansie felt as I did that she was disappointed in the size of her audience . My mother was quick to read her thoughts . " I 'm sorry the children ca n't hear it , too , " she said , " but they simply must do their lessons . We 'll all have our tea togetherlater , at nine o'clock . " " Maybe it 's just as well after all , " Mrs. Gowan said . " I would n't say my life was especially fashioned for children . " When Ansie and I heard her say that , we were consumed by a single purpose which needed no expression . We slipped out of our shoes at the selfsame moment , closed Ansie 's door noiselessly after raising the wick of his lamp so that the thread of light could be clearly seen through the crack just in case someone peered up from below , and crept out on the floor near the head of the stairs . There was no light in the hall ; the stair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit with our backs against the protecting wall just outside his room . We could hear every word clearly and distinctly ; and now and again by careful bendings forward and peering around the angle of the wall we could even see the group in the sittingroombelow . I do n't think we once worried over the ethics ofp214our behaviour . Perhaps we were unconsciously accepting the fact that ethics often grow dim in the light of human drama and tragedy . Many times since that evening so long ago when Ansie and I huddled against the wall , and Mary 's voice murmured from her room down the hall , and the light from the open fire gleamed and glowed across the three faces in the sitting-room , I have reconstructed both the scene and Mrs. Gowan 's story in my mind , without doubt distorting some of her words , but remembering the essence of them . My father was in his chair at one side of the fireplace and my mother in hers on the other side , busy with some sewing . Mrs. Gowan sat between them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now and then as she talked she began to walk about the room . She was much given to using her hands whenever she told us anything at all ; and now we could see from our furtive glances down the dark stair well that she was extending them in a wide half circle , or clasping them together , or sometimes throwing them upward to rest uneasily upon her shoulders . " I suppose it 's usual to begin one 's life with being born , is n't it ? " she asked . " I daresay it is , " my father said , taking his pipe from his pocket and beginning to fill it . " I think you once told me you were born up in Aroostook County , Maine . " " That 's true , " Mrs. Gowan said . " And when I was born way up there all those many years ago , Aroostook County was n't so much as a county , only just the Aroostook . It was a great tract of land with wide-open plains and dark forest regionsand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long distance . They say today there are fields of potatoes up there , potatoes enough for all the world , and huge farms and big , bustling towns . I would n't know about that , for I 've never seen Aroostook County since I was seventeen years old.  |p215My  mother used to say over and over again that I 'd burn someday in Hell . I used to think then , and I 've thought ever since , that the burnings in Hell could n't be so bad as the burningsinside me when I was young in that wild Aroostook region . " Ansie and I could hear Mrs. Gowan walking about then . We could almost hear the silence , too , in the sitting-room ; but after a few minutes she sat down again on the hassock , and her voice grew more even and quiet . " When I was young , it was a lonely land enough . There were n't any towns to speak of , only tiny settlements of French and Canadians and us Americans all mixed together , for then no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't any railroads then . There was just this land going on and on with the wind sweeping over it and great shadows racing under the heavy clouds . I used to think it went on foreverand forever without any end . Or sometimes I 'd think that God had forgotten it and never finished it . Or perhaps that it was just dead and could never come alive . When you saw a man as you often did putting up a fence to shut in some of the land to make it his , you wanted to go and hang on to the fence because it was a sign that someday there would be a safe , enclosed field , or perhaps because it was just something to hang on to . " " I can see all the land and the fences , " my mother said quietly , " but not your father and mother , Mrs. Gowan . " " I ca n't make you see my father , " Mrs. Gowan said . " I do n't remember him at all . He went up there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frozen to death the very first winter when I was only three . " I could hear Ansie draw in his breath beside me . I knew he was wishing for more about Mrs. Gowan 's father and was hopeful when my father said :  | " How did that happen ? That must have been hard on your mother , Mrs. Gowan . " " Nothing was hard on my mother , " Mrs. Gowan said . " She was so hard herself that nothing could have made her harder . How did it happen that my father got frozen to death ? Why , he went out one winter day to hunt for deer which often bounded across the land from one forest to another . He went on snowshoes as men did then in untamed country , and I guess he just got lost in a blizzard or smitten by the awful cold way up there in the north . Anyhow he never came back , and they found him frozen to death some days later when some men went out to look for him . My father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but my mother stayed frozen all her life . " " Perhaps you 'd like to mend these socks of Ansie 's while you talk , " my mother said . " No , I would n't like to mend them , " Mrs. Gowan said . " I need my hands free , to talk . " " What made your mother frozen all her life ? " my father asked . " God , " Mrs. Gowan said sharply . Ansie and I snuggled more closely together in our dark corner next the wall . " Too much God , or what she thought was God . Even when I was a child , I never believed God could have any use for my mother . But she did . She said that God was right there in our kitchen watching me while I dried the dishes or made our bed in a sort of lean-to we had . And when I was too frightened and shaky to dry them right or to spread the sheets smooth and tight , she said He was watching me and storing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't tell me , the Methodist preachers did . That 's why I 've always hated Methodistpreachers  --  until now . "  | " I see , " my father said , his voice slow and kind . " Where did the Methodist preachers come from ? " " I do n't quite know , " Mrs. Gowan said , " but one was always there . ' T was just a little settlement where we lived , just a huddle of a few houses with a store and a schoolhouse . The Methodist preacher was usually our schoolteacher , too , and after he had scared us all the weekdays , he scared us worse on Sundays in the same place , for the schoolhouse was the church as well . " " Was everyone else who lived there as religious as your mother ? " my mother asked . " No , " Mrs. Gowan said . " That 's what made a lot of trouble . The Methodist preacher , whoever he was , for they were much the same , told my mother that she had been called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mostly not saved , only discouraged and tired with too many children to care for while their husbands cleared the distant woodland or set fences around the land they wanted . She helped the preacherson Sunday in the meetings that took up most of the day and half the night . She sang and talked and screamed ; and when I was twelve or thirteen she made me get converted so I would n't be a disgrace to her , she said . But , of course , I never was converted really . She 'd write out stories for me to learn , about how God had saved me at a certain hour and how happy I was with a clean heart , and she made me get up in the meetings and recite them . About then got to roaming about the land , running out even at night whenever I could steal away while she was asleep or holding some meeting somewhere else . I was scared enough ot.tside with the wind and the great , blazing stars , and sometimes with the Northern Lights which way up there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never so scared as inside , in the bed beside my mother or sitting at the kitchenp218table learning those stories she had written out for me . That 's when I found the fences a great help to cling to . " " Perhaps you 'd rather tell us the rest some other time , Mrs. Gowan , " we heard my father say . " You do n't need to tell it all tonight . Perhaps you 'd like to play a game of checkers with me . " " No , thank you , " Mrs. Gowan said . " I 'd rather tell it all . It will make my mind clear and empty so that I can put a space-taker in it when I go to bed . Besides , you have n't heard the most exciting part . You have n't heard how at last I got away from my mother . " We could hear her now beginning again to walk about the sitting-room . I leaned forward across Ansie , for I was in the angle of the wall . I felt better about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't look really sad or too much troubled , only excitedand eager . Her hands were restless , but her eyes were much the same as when she listened to our stories in the orchardor to my father 's rhymes and songs . " There 's quite a bit to tell before that , though , " she said . " It is n't exactly pleasant or even good , but it 's true . I began to hate my mother . The worst times of hatred were when I was in bed with her at night after she had prayed aloud with us both on our knees shivering in the cold . Sometimes it seemed hours that she prayed . I used to lie against the wall , on the inside of the bed ; and after she had gone to sleep , I used to imagine how I could kill her , with my father 's huntingknife , I thought , for the men had brought that home when they had found him frozen . Then I 'd ask God to forgive me , though I never felt He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " And whenever I 'd fall asleep I 'd have these awful dreams . I 'd dream either about the knife sticking out of my mother 's throat , or else I 'd dream that she was chasing me with thep219knife in her hand . We were often running around fences in my dreams . I 'd often be clinging to a fence post , for help I suppose , and she 'd be running along the tops of the logs that framed the fences and getting nearer and nearer with the knife to the post I was clinging to . Then I 'd wake up with a start and find myself soaked in sweat whatever the weather , and lie there waiting for the light to come . " " Did n't you ever have any good times at all ? " my mother said . " Were n't there any other children or young people for good times in that wretched settlement ? " Mrs. Gowan came back to her hassock . " Yes , there were , " she said , " but most of them thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scared of my mother . There was one boy I really liked when I was around fifteen , and he really liked me . When my mother was out ranting around with the preacher , for on some days they took trips together to hold these meetings in other huddles of houses , he used to come to see me unless they made me go along with them to tell my falsehoods in their meetings . I was n't badlookingas a young girl . I had yellow hair which curled nicely , though my mother made me braid it tightly around my head ; and I was light on my feet and might have danced well if I had ever been allowed to . And after I got to ranging around outside whenever I could escape or my mother was off somewhere , this boy , this John King , would meet me and we 'd talk . He hated the Aroostook , too , though his folks were nice and kind . He 'd lend me books , and I 'd hide them in the deep pockets of my skirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd read them with my back against one of the fence posts quite a long way from home ; and when the wind fluttered the leaves so that I could hardly keep them flat , they made me think how my heart fluttered at night , in bed , beyondmy mother.  | " There was one book , Treasure Island it was , which I loved . I 've never finished it through all these many years , even though it 's right there in the library at the hospital and I could read it any time , only I ca n't because whenever I see it I begin to get muddled and forget who I really am . My mother discoveredme reading it at just the place where a boy named Jim Hawkins was hiding in an apple barrel on board a ship and listening to pirates or mutineers . I 've never known what happened afterwards or how the boy escaped , for she snatched it away from me at just that very place and threw it on the fire in the kitchen stove . " " Ansie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or , better still , I 'll read it aloud to us all in the orchard . You wo n't feel in the least muddled when we read it together , Mrs. Gowan . " " Thank you , " Mrs. Gowan said . " Well , I 'd better get on with my story , for the really exciting place is now close at hand . This boy , this John King , went away to study in some academy farther south . I 'd have loved to study more , too , but my mother would n't hear to that . She had discovered about his coming to see me and about our meetings far afield . She gave me terrible warnings about what she called fleshly temptations of the Devil , ' and forbade me to see him any more even when he came home from school now and then to see his folks . So , until I was seventeen , we went on with me hatingher and with her really hating me , though she claimed she was helping God to save my immortal soul . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought she had begun to walk about some more , but she had n't , for we could hear no sound in the sitting-room except the murmur of the fire . Then she said slowly and thoughtfully : " There 's a place in the Bible where it tells about people who walked in darkness . Well , that was where I walked . As I remember that place in the Bible , a great light at last shone uponp221those people , but none ever shone around me up there in Aroostook , Maine . John King was a bit of a light as I recall him , but he went out just as a match goes out when it has burned away its slender stick . He hoped to be a doctor ; hetold me a lot about it . That was his dream , but I 've neverknown whether it ever came true for him . " One day the strangest thing happened to me . If you should read it in some book , you would never believe it , yet it 's true all the same and what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps in a queer way , but it saved it no matter what it may have done to me later on . Up there in those great , wide , mostly unfenced fields things were always blowing about before the high winds  --  sometimes careening brown masses of what they call tumbleweed , sometimes pieces of clothing that had slatted from lines in distant settlements , sometimes even hats and caps , or letters dropped by people perhaps miles away . Newspapers were the most common . When you were walking in a high , strong wind , you were likely to see newspapers , whole or in single sheets , billowing along toward you , end over end , now in the air , now scurrying next to the ground . And whenever you saw one , or at least whenever I did , I 'd seize it and read whatever I could just in order to take my thoughts away from my mother if only for a few minutes . " On this day that I 'm telling you about I saw a newspaper blowing toward me across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the sudden , queer notion that there might be something in it just for me . I was feeling more desperate than ever , for the new Methodist preacher we had at that time was a single man who hung about my mother . He said she had been seized by the Holy Ghost and was the holiest woman he had ever seen . He was a big man with a black beard and cruel black eyes . I knew he was up to no good , and I hated and feared him . The only thing he ever did for me was to make it easier forp222me to get out of the house , for when he was there in the kitchen with my mother and talking in his crazy way , they neither of them wanted me around . " Mrs. Gowan was evidently getting up to walk about again , for we heard my mother say : " I think you 'd best sit down to tell the rest , do n't you , Mrs. Gowan ? If you 'll just sit on your hassock right between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends , I 'm sure you can tell the rest of your story even better . " " Perhaps , " Mrs. Gowan said . " I do n't want to make you uneasy by my walking about when you 're so kind as to listen to me like this . " " It 's not that at all , " my mother said . " It 's only that I can hear better when you 're nearer me . I really think I do n't hear so clearly as I used to do , and I would n't want to miss a word about that newspaper and what you found in it just for you . " We knew then that she was on her hassock again . Now she raised her voice higher , perhaps because of my mother , perhaps because of her mounting excitement . " That newspaper , " she said . " That newspaper all brown with rain and dew and soil . When I had once caught it , I lay flat down on that big , empty space of land and began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspapers to read , for it had once been folded carefully  --  it even trailed a piece of string  --  and it was n't yet blown to pieces . It came from Boston  --  it said Boston on it  --  and it was dated only five days earlier . This queer notion kept stabbing at me , this notionthat it had something in it just for me , and at last I found it on the very back page . There , on that very back page among the advertisements , was a notice signed with the letter , J.G. It was a notice from a man  --  I swear it 's true  --  who said he wanted a wife . He said she ought to be about eighteen and ready to lead an interesting , adventuresome life . He said hep223could promise her kind treatment always , and if she would write to him at an address he gave , he 'd tell her more about himself . I read it again and again , lying there beneath swirlingthunderheads in the sky , for there seemed , if I remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and the address stayed in my mind and ran about there for hours like some old hymn tune . " When I went back home in the rain and wind and thunder , night was falling and my mother was gone , somewhere with the preacher , I supposed , only I just saw that she was gone , and I looked upon her being gone as just another part of the plan just for me . I decided then and there that I would n't wait to write this J.G. It took weeks up there in the Aroostook to get a letter from any place at all . I 'd never had a letter all my life from anyone or ever written one that I could remember . I knew if I waited that long , all my courage would leave me , even if I could put down words in a letter or even if my mother did n't ferret things out . I just decided I 'd go , and if he was n't there at that address , or if he 'd already found a wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do anything just to get away . I do n't think I thought then that I 'd really find him , or perhaps even look for him , though the address kept nagging at me . It 's hard to know exactly what I thought so many years ago ; but I think now it was the address 18 Milk street , it was that made me determine to go . It was something to hang on to 18 Milk Street like those few fences across all that great , barren land . " Once I 'd made up my mind to go , I went into the lean-to , which was the bedroom as I said , and began to get a few things together with the thunder bursting overhead . There was a straw basket with a cover on it on a shelf there , and I put my things in that . Then I suddenly thought I 'd have to have some money . I did n't have a cent of my own or anyp224purse either . But it was n't as though I did n't know where there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she kept the Sunday collections and the prayer-meeting ones in a tin box under her side of the bed . She kept the key to the tin box in the lining of an old hat in the closet . There was $64.13 in the tin box , and I took every penny of it . Then in the midst of all the thunder and the lightning which I knew would be keeping her wherever she and the preacher were , I lighted the stub of a candle and wrote her a letter tellingher how I hated her for what she had done to me and how I 'd gone , past finding out . When I 'd finished the letter and blown out the candle and opened the door to the rain and the wind , I had the strangest feeling  --  not that I was saying goodbye to my mother or to what she called my home , but to all the fences in Aroostook , Maine .  --  I guess now I 'll have to walk about a bit , but I wo n't say anything until I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " my father said . " You walk about all you like , Mrs. Gowan . " It was terribly still in the sitting-room while Mrs. Gowan walked to and fro . The fire sighed and sizzled , but there was no other sound except for her feet when they left the big square rug for the boards of the floor . My legs ached painfully from being folded under me , but I did n't dare stir . Mary 's voice had stopped murmuring , and I was prickled all over by needles of dread lest she might come out and find us there . Ansie was so motionless I thought he might be asleep or perhapseven dead from fright . I put out my hand to touch him . He seized it and kept on holding it , which was extraordinary behaviour from him . By and by we heard Mrs. Gowan begin again with her story and knew she had returned to the hassock . " It was a long way to Boston . First , I had to run four or fivep225miles in the storm to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Maine , stopped . I knew that because that John King boy had told me how he got on it late at night in order to go south to his school . I kept thanking God for the storm , though probably He did n't send it just for me . But in the thick darkness and the awful rain no one was out and no one could see me on my way . When I was n't thanking God , I kept saying 18 Milk Street , 18 Milk Street , over and over , like a prayer , too . " I do n't recall all the journey now , but I know it took several days in different stagecoaches or wagons and with stops at inns or boardinghouses where people were kind to me . When they asked me my name , I said I was Dora Smith and that I was a servant girl in Boston . They did n't ask me much , and I did n't say much either . I know it 's wrong to say it , but as I got farther and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money tied up safely in my handkerchief . I got this flutteringfeeling inside me , but light like the sun , not dark like the flutterings of fear . At first I thought it might mean I was sick in some odd way , and then I suddenly knew it was just happiness which I 'd mistaken because I had never felt it before . Once , on one of the stagecoaches , a blue butterfly flew in the open window , and I laughed aloud to see him as free and happy as I was . I 've never forgotten that blue butterfly . I 've remembered it all my life . " It was on a morning when we got to Boston . I 'd heard or read somewhere about Boston Common , so I found my way there and sat still in the sunshine . There were pigeons flying and hopping about , free like the butterfly and me . I do n't think even then that I really meant to hunt up this man , this J.G. , but 18 Milk Street kept running in my mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't know what else to do and in all my new happiness was worried because I did n't know anyp226way of getting any more money or finding any work , I asked my way there . The place turned out to be a butchershop with legs and sides of meat in the window and a fat man inside in a dirty apron using a long knife like my father 's hunting knife at home . I went in after a time and asked this man if someone called J.G. lived there . He looked surprised enough to see me there , just a slip of a thing I was then and likely mussed and untidy . You must mean Jim Gowan , ' he said to me . He do n't live here , but he comes in every noontime to see if any letters have come for him . Take a chair , ' he said . It 's about time for him right now . You know him ? You a relative ? ' Sort of a relative , ' I said , and I 'll wait outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , slicing at some meat with his big knife and still looking surprised . " I went down to the corner of the street where I could see anyone coming in all directions . I knew him the minute I saw him coming toward me . It was just as though I was told who he was . He was n't much more than a boy , small and almost puny-like , and he slipped along among all the many people almost like an eel or a snake . He was there , and then he was n't , in and out . When he got next me , I touched his arm in a corduroy jacket , and he started as though he was scared to death and stared at me . I 've forgotten now just what I said , but I think it was , Are you J.G. and are you still looking for a wife ? ' He just stared more at me , standing there with my straw basket . By God ! ' he said . Let 's get out of here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the Common again and found a place to sit , on an empty bench in a cluster of trees . ' T was funny about the pigeons . They kept coming to rest on his shoulders , though they fluttered away from me . He could take them right in his hands . We talked there . He had a low , quiet voice , which sounded to me as if he 'd come from some unbeknownstp227place , and he was nice and kind . He said he 'd had several answers to his advertisement in the paper , but most of them that wrote were far older than me and rather set in their ways , though how he knew that I could n't say . He was very honest with me after I 'd told him about my mother and how I 'd come that long way . By God ! ' he kept saying . You wo n't be well off most likely , with me , but a wharf rat like me is better to live with than that devil . ' " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because I 've forgotten so much since then . Anyway some days later we went to a priest and got married because he was a Catholic and I did n't care . " " Just what is a wharf rat ? " my mother asked . Her voice trembled a little , and we could hear her blowing her nose . " A wharf rat , " Mrs. Gowan said with her customary dignityin explanation , " a wharf rat is a thief . He 's able to slink around wharves and piers where cargoes are coming in or goingout . In those days there was a vast amount of shipping from many ports , Boston and New York and Philadelphia and Baltimore and New Orleans . We just moved from one to another where things were busiest or when my husband had reason to think there was danger in his staying too long in any one of them . I never quite understood just why he needed a wife , but he said a wife made him more respectable and coveredup scents and clues . " " Was this man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . His voice sounded puzzled as well as concerned , as though he could n't realize the mutually exclusive facts of Mrs. Gowan sitting on her hassock and Mrs. Gowan helping to evade the police in some seaport town . " Yes , he was , " Mrs. Gowan said . " I know he would be called a bad man , but he was always good to me . When he was at home , he helped me with my work always , and when he'dp228done well in his business , he often brought me gifts , and he never forgot to thank me and to say I was a good wife to him . And just as he 'd said in that newspaper , he gave me a very adventuresome life . Where did n't we go ? I 've been to the southern states and even to Mexico , and once  --  that was after the railroads came  --  we went to San Francisco on all its many hills and above its great bay . Sometimes we had plenty of money , and at other times we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was always good to me . We lived in all manner of houses , in dark , upper rooms sometimes and at other times in real houses with roses blossoming on their back fences . He had many friends or at least companions . They 'd come often at night after I 'd gone to bed and shift lots of boxes and bags about . Some of them were prosperous-looking men , whenever I 'd catch a glimpse of them , with gold watch chains and fine clothes . Others were different , with names like Peg Leg , and One Eye , and Black Bill . Often I 'd be alone for a good many months , and then I 'd work . I 've always been good with my needle  --  I have my mother to thank for that , I suppose . Once , while my husband was in prison for a spell , I worked in a big factory that made flags , in Philadelphia , that was , and I got so good and quick at making flags that I was made the manager of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I wish I could tell you both things , " Mrs. Gowan said , " but I truly ca n't . I do n't know whatever became of my husband , and I do n't know how long I was married to him . It was many years , I 'm sure , most of my life perhaps , but I do n't know . I think it was while I was making flags in that factory that I got bewildered in my mind and forgot who I really was . There 's a long space empty that I ca n't fill . Anyway , when things got clear again , I was in the hospital , quite safep229and well . Then I realized that I knew all about the Aroostook and all about my childhood and a lot about my marriage , but that the rest was sort of a jungle where I had got lost . I love the hospital . It 's been a home to me and , though I sometimes even now forget exactly who I am , I mostly know quite well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I surely would , " my father said , pride and confidence in his words . " We 're all glad you 're well again , Mrs. Gowan , and just like one of us . " Ansie and I heard him put another log on the fire , which began to crackle and blaze . " There 's one thing I did n't tell you , " Mrs. Gowan said . " I had a baby once , but it died before we could get a priest to baptize it , and that troubled my husband . He said he could have baptized it himself if only he 'd been home at the time . He said it could never go to Heaven because it had never been baptized . Is that right ? Do you believe that ? " " No ! " my father and mother said , both together and very sharply . " I 'm glad , " Mrs. Gowan said . " But when I think of Heaven , I do n't believe I want to go there if it means seeing people I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that . I 'd rather think the house of God is in the orchard as you said or whereverfolks are merry . You do n't think I 'll ever have to see my mother again , do you , or even the baby , or my husband ? " " I 'm sure you wo n't , " my father said . " You must n't let yourself worry about that , Mrs. Gowan . " " Thank you , " Mrs. Gowan said in her grave , polite way . " That 's a great comfort to me . When I think of dying , which ca n't be far away , I wonder if perhaps I ca n't sometime come right back to this earth , maybe as someone else quite different from me now , but anyway come back . That 's one of the things Charley Bright believes very strongly . I 'd like to seep230all those places you 've told me about in England or in Ireland where Mrs. McCarthy was born . What would you say to that ? " " We do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " only that it ca n't be cruel or unjust or even sad since it belongs to God . I often think just as you do , Mrs. Gowan , that there 's a lot for us to do right here . Maybe we 'll all come back in some strange way . Who knows ? If I were you , I 'd keep right on dreaming about coming back . " " And who cares ? " cried my mother . " We 're all right here and happy together , and we all love you , Mrs. Gowan . " At that moment , by the luckiest sort of chance , Mrs. Baxter came in the side door with so much noise and cheerful bustle that Ansie and I could get back into his room without any danger of being discovered . I think our evening tea was something of a strain upon us all except at its beginning for Mary , who , still unaware of what had been taking place in the sitting-room , was thinking of the Lady of Shalott floating down the river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mrs. Baxter , bringing in the tray at nine o'clock , was clearly puzzled . My mother , bending over her sewing basket by the table beneath the lamp , was silent ; Mrs. Gowan on her hassock with her hands clasped tightly in her lap seemed thoughtful and subdued , though she was evidently not in Philadelphia ; my father was even more abstracted than usual ; and Ansie and I , hugging our aching knees on the floor before the fire , might well have looked guilty to so practiced an eye as Mrs. Baxter 's . When she had cleared a space on the table for the tea tray , she looked about quizzically upon us all . " The night 's clear as a bell , " she said . " Should n't wonder ap231mite if there 'll not be a frost by morning . Well , what 's my family been doing to keep out of mischief ? " It seemed a long time before anyone answered her . Then my father roused himself . " The children have all been hard at their lessons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been telling my wife and me a most interesting story . " Mrs. Gowan sent him an anxious look , and he reassured her by a smile . " That 's nice , " Mrs. Baxter said . " Nothing like a good story on a cold night like this . What was this particular story about ? " " Why , " my father said a bit hesitantly after another awkwardsilence , " why  --  it was about a blue butterfly in a stagecoachmany years ago . " Mrs. Baxter stared at him in some alarm . Mrs. Gowan looked safe and happy . " The tea 's in , my dear , " my father said . " Will you pour out ? " My mother set aside her mending then and began , rather slowly for her , to arrange the cups and saucers . " Sit down , Mrs. Baxter , " my father said . " You 'll fancy a good hot cup , I daresay , after your long cold walk . Was it Mrs. Kimball you went to see ? How is she ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circle , looking slightly suspicious or at least questioning as she did so . Until my father 's odd description of Mrs. Gowan 's story , she had obviously singled out my mother as well as Ansie and me , flushed and silent by the fire , for the chief objects of her speculation . Now she was concerned for us all . " She 's more than a little melancholy , I must say , " she told my father . " Lots of other folks have had the quincy , and as everyone knows it 's not pleasant . But , there ! Most peoplep232take things as they come without so much to-do . Only not Mrs. Kimball . She just wilts . " " I 'm sure she liked the custards , " Mary said , breaking yet another pause . " Maybe so . I would n't know . She would n't try one while I was there though they do slip down nice and smooth . She just kept on feeling sorry for herself . " " Was Mr. Kimball there ? " my father asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , just setting , poor man . Probably plain out of his wits with her takings-on . " " I daresay , " my father said , slowly stirring his tea . " What have you twins been up to ? " Mrs. Baxter asked , carefully surveying Ansie and me . I waited for Ansie to speak . " Doing stinking problems about wallpaper , " Ansie said . Since his forbidden adjective evoked no reproof , he repeated it . " Just stinking , " he said , " and I mean plain stinking . " " Ansie ! " Mary cried . " Mother , you know he 's not supposedto use such words ! " My mother finished pouring out the tea , passing a cup to each of us . I sprang to Ansie 's defense . " Well , they are horrid , " I said . " Just these silly men paperingstupid walls . We missed you frightfully , Mrs. Baxter . " " You do n't mean to say you did n't finish them ? " Mrs. Baxter asked with real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said . " Miss Miller wo n't take kindly to that , I 'm telling you , " warned Mrs. Baxter . " She 's stinking , too , " Ansie said , growing bolder . " She 's the worst old teacher in the whole school . I 'll bet she ca n't do those problems herself . Everyone hates her . " " I think that will do , Ansie , " my father said.  |p233Ansie  subsided . " She is something of a tartar , sir , " Mrs. Baxter said , springingas always to Ansie 's assistance . " I understand on good authoritythat the school board  --  " " Mere pupils are not supposed to know about school boards , Mrs. Baxter , " my father said , sharply for him . He put another log on the fire . Mrs. Baxter , after some moments of embarrassment , scrutinized Ansie and me again . " Well , if you care to get up an hour earlier , " she said , " before I start breakfast , I suppose I could help you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be subtracted ? Those men , Mr. A. and Mr. B. ? " " That 's right , " Ansie said . " Those silly old paperhangers . Thank you , Mrs. Baxter . " " What have you been doing , Mary ? " Mrs. Baxter asked in the somewhat suffocating stillness . " Just memorizing potty old poetry , " Ansie said revengefully . " All they do in that academy is memorize potty old poetry . " " Keep still , Ansie , " Mary said , looking about helplessly for support which seemed to be nonexistent . " Frankly , you make me sick and tired . " " What poetry ? " Mrs. Baxter asked kindly . " A beautiful poem , " Mary said , " called The Lady of Shalott . I 'd be glad to say the first verse , that is , if anyone in this dull old tea party wants to hear it . " My father made an heroic effort to pull himself back from Aroostook County , One Eye , Peg Leg , and Black Bill . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said to Mary . " Yes , " Mrs. Gowan said , speaking for the first time . " I love to hear poetry . Please say it , Mary . " Mary looked hopefully at my mother for further encouragement , but she looked in vain . My mother 's head was bentp234again over her mending . She did not so much as glance at Mary . " Stand by me , dear , " Mrs. Baxter said . " It 's always nicer when one stands to recite . " Mary moved toward Mrs. Baxter 's chair . Mrs. Gowan turned on the hassock to face her . A note of sadness crept into my sister 's voice : " The poem 's about a lady who loves a knight of King Arthur'sRound Table , " she said . " Only she 's heartbroken because he does n't love her . So  --  well , she just dies . " " Coo ! " said Ansie with utmost disdain . My father seemed not to notice him , but Mrs. Baxter actuallysent him a dire frown , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached for another cooky and turned his face toward the fire . Mary 's voice filled the quiet room : " On either side the river lieLong fields of barley and of rye , That clothe the wold and meet the sky ; And through the field the road runs by To many-towered Camelot ... " She recited several of the following stanzas about reapers in the barley and piles of sheaves in the moonlight . Perhaps the sadness of the poem itself , coupled with the bewilderment of so strange and unusual an atmosphere in the sitting-room , lent a special eloquence to her voice , for she gave an extremelygood recitation . " Very well done , Mary , " my father said . " Lovely , " said Mrs. Baxter . " Just lovely ! " Ansie and I said nothing , but Mrs. Gowan on her hassock sprang suddenly into new life . Her eyes widened with pleasure.  | " It must be harvest-time along that river , " she said , " when they gather in the grain and the hay . That 's my most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is gathered in . Where I lived when I was young there were n't many fields fenced in and given to grass and hay ; but once , when I was about your age , Ansie , a farmer let me tread down the hay in his rack and ride right on the top of it while he drove his oxen into his barn . It was the happiest of times for me . I 'll never forget it . " " That 's what we do here , Mrs. Gowan , " Ansie said , glad of the chance to reinstate himself in the family circle . " When the hay is all dried and raked into cocks , my father pitches it into a hayrack , and we tread it down for him , do n't we , father ? " " Yes , " my father said . " That 's right . " " And we sing the harvest songs he sang when he was a boy , " I said , eager now like Ansie to do my bit toward furtheringthis lightened atmosphere . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are going toward the barn . " " Oh ! " Mrs. Gowan cried , with a sharp intake of her breath . " That must be wonderful . I 'd love that . " " Mrs. Baxter 's awfully good at treading , " Ansie said . " She 's helped to make the loads for us for two summers now , have n't you , Mrs. Baxter ? " Mrs. Baxter smiled at him . " He means I 'm good because I weigh nigh on to one hundred and eighty pounds , " she said to Mrs. Gowan . " That weight treads down a heap of hay . " Mrs. Gowan laughed with Mrs. Baxter . Then Mary laughed halfheartedly . Finally Ansie and I contributed a few chuckles co the somewhat listless mirth . At this point my mother folded her mending , picked some stray threads from her skirt , and rose quickly to her feet.  | " Next summer when you come , Mrs. Gowan , it must be at haying time , " she said . Mrs. Gowan stared at my mother from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean I 'm to be invited again , " she managed to say , interlacing her fingers in excitement . " Of course , you are , " my mother said lightly . As she passed Mrs. Gowan , she put her arms around the old woman 's shoulders , drawing her white head closely against her for a moment . Then from the door to the kitchen she turned to look back upon us all . " And now , every last one of you , get to bed , " she said , more than firmly . " You children , Mrs. Baxter , Mrs. Gowan , and the head of this house . I want a fresh cup of tea and a half hour quite to myself . Mrs. Baxter , take up Mrs. Gowan 's lamp for her . John , put up the fireguard . Mary , no more memorizingtonight . And , you twins , do n't forget to say your prayers . Now , every last one of you , get out of my way , and do n't take any time about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit in the early summer of 1904 she found many changes among us , all of which delighted her . She could not get over , she said , the added inches which we three children had attained during the year . Mary had shot up unbelievably . At nearly sixteen she was tall and as pretty as she was slender and graceful . She wrote more and more poetry and was much given to roaming off by herself , a habit which annoyed me excessively , althoughmy mother said we must all be resigned to it , and Mrs. Baxter informed me knowingly that it was " all part of the picture . " Just what picture she did not describe . Ansie and 1 at thirteen had grown taller , too . Ansie was threatening dailyp237to overtop my mother ; and he had suddenly become so strong that he could pick her up and carry her across the room . " Elevated , like all the Oldroyds , " my mother said to my father . " Let 's hope the resemblance stops right there . " Perhaps the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Ansie would go away to school in the autumn , to Phillips Academy in Exeter , New Hampshire . Through Dr. Thomas , who had himself gone to Exeter as a boy , my father had been assured of a scholarship for Ansie . He was to wait on tables in return for his fees , like hundreds of other Americanboys , my father said proudly . I was to enter the academy in Pepperell where Mary , already dreaming of college though no one knew quite how it was to be managed , had but one more year . Mrs. Gowan 's eyes shone when she saw the nametapesmarked Anselm Bentley Tilly ard in red printed letters ; and she happily laid aside her flags to sew them with fine , close stitches on Ansie 's new shirts and socks . Ansie inspected these a dozen times a day . I tried in vain to discover the least regret in his heart at leaving me . Mrs. Gowan herself had changed , and all for the best , my father said with vast pride and confidence . Although she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her Betsy Ross world had seemingly faded quite out of sight . She did not travel to Philadelphia even once during her second visit with us . She still sewed upon her flags , to be sure , but with a new and absorbing purpose . Through the hospital , which supplied her generously with the bunting , she had been asked to match and stitch the long red and white stripes , cut and set the white stars on the blue background , for some schools and public buildings in return for a payment which she considered phenomenal . To be earning money on her own was an unprecedentedjoy , more than sufficient to oust even General Washingtonfrom her mind . Mrs. Baxter explained to her thep238somewhat temperamental intricacies of the parsonage sewing machine , which she learned to use with skill and excitement . She was free , radiant , ecstatic , and at the same time , if one could judge from her face , serene and unperturbed . Only her new riches weighed now and again upon her conscience . One afternoon when my father spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a really large flag for a school in a thriving Maine town , when we all stood about admiring her delicate handwork on the stars and her even stitching on the long stripes , when Mrs. Baxter had declared that never in all her born days had she seen such a wonderful accomplishment , Mrs. Gowan 's clear eyes grew troubled . " Now that I 'm really earning money , " she said hesitantly , scanning my father 's satisfied , assured face , " now that I could pay back that $64.13-perhaps you may remember  --  those Methodists , I mean , up in that Aroostook  --  those preachers  --  my mother  --  that tin box  --  I could pay it back , I mean , to any Methodist church at all . " Mrs. Baxter looked puzzled and more than a little disturbed . Ansie and I exchanged surreptitious glances . " Whatever is she talking about ? " Mary whispered to me . " I would n't know , " I whispered back , waiting for my father to reassure our guest , relieved when my mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Not a penny , Mrs. Gowan ! " she cried . " Not one wretched penny ! Forget it all . Promise me you 'll never pay back so much as a penny ! " " My wife is quite right , Mrs. Gowan , " my father said at last . " That debt has been cancelled a thousand times with quite too heavy interest on it , too . Do n't ever think about it again . " " You have n't promised me yet , Mrs. Gowan , " my mother persisted , still to Mary 's and Mrs. Baxter 's bewilderment . " Un/less you promise me straightaway , you ca n't sew one more name-tape on Ansie 's things . " Mrs. Gowan in her turn looked distressed , but , with all her misgivings , immensely relieved . " I promise , " she said . " And now what would you say to daisies and buttercups for our wreaths ? There 's really no flowers quite like buttercups and daisies . " Mrs. Gowan 's favourite flowers fortunately bloomed in abundance along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them made no serious inroads upon the grass , tall and ripeningnow in late June in readiness for haying . She made us all wreaths of them , plaiting them adroitly by braiding and weaving their long stems in and out . Once we were crowned and Mrs. Baxter had brought out the tea , my father told stories of Harvest Home festivals in Suffolk : how the reapers and binders and thatchers gathered together at long tables under the trees or sometimes in the old barns for suppers of mirth and song , for hams and bacon , roast beef and plum puddings , and flagons of home-brewed ale , all furnished by the farmer for his workers after their long hours of stripping the fields with scythes and sickles ; how , tired as they were from swinging and pitching and stacking , they continued to smoke their clay pipes , drink their ale and beer , and sing their songs until the stars came out above the new yellow ricks and the bare , cropped fields . " The suppers were called Largesse Suppers or sometimes Frolic Suppers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were red poppies then all through the grain , were n't there , father ? " Ansie said . " I can remember the red poppies in the fields , Mrs. Gowan . " " So can I , " I said . " Yes , " my father said . " I miss the poppies here . People used to say that they were n't too good for the grain ; but , even so ,  |p240they  made it beautiful . The best man among the harvesters , Mrs. Gowan , was always called King of the Mowers . ' He told the men where to swing their scythes in the swaths or work their sickles in the tangled growths next the hedges . He always wore a wreath of poppies around his hat as he stalked about the fields giving his orders to the labourers . Sometimes , when I was a boy , women and girls did the sickling . This King of the Mowers ' called a halt now and then , a breather ' he called it , and then everyone had a swallow or two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the hedge . " " I 've never seen a real hedge , " Mrs. Gowan said . " I mean one that separates fields . I only know fences . Perhaps one day I 'll see a real hedge  --  in England . " " I 'm sure you will , " my mother said . " Sing the Harvest Home Song , Ansie , for Mrs. Gowan . You 'll all sing it on the top of the loads when the hay is cut next week . " " Yes , Ansie , sing it for us , " Mrs. Baxter said . Ansie sang the song , his wreath of buttercups askew upon his yellow hair . His eyes , 1 thought enviously , seemed to grow far bluer than mine as we got older . " It 's very easy , " he said . " You can sing it most any way , Mrs. Gowan . It 's really a shout almost as much as it 's a song . It goes : Harvest Home ! Harvest Home ! Merry , merry , merry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy , " my father said , " we used to sing that song all along the lanes and drifts on August nights , once the harvest was gathered in . After the suppers were over , all the young men and women , even the small boys and girls , went through the villages in long lines and out through the countryside , singing and shouting that old song , especially if it hadp241been a fair , dry harvest . Once in a while some fellow would have a mouth organ or even a raspy old fiddle , but mostly it was just the singing . When we came to a new , freshly stacked rick , standing all yellow in a field or rickyard , we 'd sing that song . It was almost more a hymn than a song , a thanksgiving for a fine harvest and for the promise of a safe winter with wheat and barley for our bread , and hay for the animals , and money , too , at market-time . That song always takes me back home again  --  to Suffolk and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , father , " I said . " Yes , " my father said , smiling at me . " Always back to Bury  --  the market and the abbey . " Mrs. Gowan 's face grew suddenly grave and thoughtful . " There 's really nothing like a lovely memory to live by , now , is there ? " she said . Just before it was time for haying a soft rain fell which kept us all indoors for a day . No one minded much . My father said that rain of that gentle nature would only help the hay , make its roots pliable for cutting . He seized upon the afternoon to make some distant parish calls behind Snow White . Mary retreated to our room , which she clearly wanted to herself for her own pursuits ; and Ansie , in his , studied the cataloguefrom Exeter which described his new life , although to his regret it gave more space to studies than to sports and games . Mrs. Baxter transformed the kitchen into a veritable jam and pickle factory , my mother said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the first fruits of the garden and fields , cucumbers , green tomatoes , onions , and strawberries , to a blistering stove where every manner of container boiled and bubbled and sent forth delectable , spicy fragrances which penetrated to the sitting-room through ap242tightly closed door . My mother and Mrs. Gowan sewed and talked there ; and I moved from one room to the other , now hulling strawberries or wielding a paring knife for Mrs. Baxter , who , skeptical of my talents , pestered me with advice and caution , now holding skeins of wool for my mother , who was planning to knit yet another jersey for Ansie . It was during one of my sojourns in the sitting-room as the lesser of two boredoms that I heard Mrs. Gowan telling my mother about her life in the hospital . She seemed relaxed and very much at ease as she talked ; and when she got to Charley Bright and the camels and to Mrs. McCarthy with her feather , 1 became so interested that I dreaded a summons from Mrs. Baxter , who might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course ) discover that she could make use of me in her jam and pickle factory . " Folks get all sorts of mistaken ideas about people in hospitals like ours , " Mrs. Gowan said . " They think we 're all strange and queer in our minds and perhaps even dangerous ; but that 's not really true . Of course , we 've had odd notions and sometimes terrible fears and troubles enough , else we would n't be there at all ; and often the notions and the fears ca n't be removed from our minds . There are some of us that talk far too much and others that do n't talk at all , just sit , silent for hours on end  --  I do n't mean in thin silences like Mrs. Nesbit 's , but in thick , heavy , dark silences that ca n't be lifted . And , of course , there are others who are very ill indeed , so that they have to be kept shut away by themselves . But even with all these things that are true , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all manner of things to do and people to be kind and understanding to us . " She paused for a few moments to look out the window at the softly fallingrain . " Sometimes I think , " she continued , " that people in the world outside have far greater burdens than we insidep243have to carry . " " Why would you think that , Mrs. Gowan ? " my mother asked with a quick , encouraging smile . " Well , I 'll tell you , " Mrs. Gowan said . " Not that I 've often seen hundreds of people together as those do who travel on trains , or walk about city streets , or attend churches and other public gatherings , or cross the ocean as you did once . But a few years ago I really did see a vast number of people together which gave me a chance to look carefully at them , or to study their faces , as you might say . It was when that nice young man , Charley Bright , was with us . Dr. and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country fair so that we could see the farm animals , and the merry-go-round , and all the exhibits of flowers and vegetables . It was a rare treat for us . Charley Bright and I rode on the merry-go-round , on two camels side by side , just like the youngsters , only a lot of older people were riding , too . All the animals rocked as we went round and round , in tune with the music . Then we walked up and down the main thoroughfare , seeing all the people , the side shows and the shooting at wooden ducks , and all the games of chance and luck . They were all new to me after so many years in the hospital ; but I think it was the people that interestedme most and that made me rather sad when I lived the day over in my mind . I kept watching their faces and wondering what their worlds were like and what they were having to carry about with them , without any help , sickness , perhaps , and loneliness , and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the fear of death . " I got thinking of all those secret sorrows and cares , shut up inside of each , and how each had to carry his own sorrow around with him right in this world with small chance of framing any other world to live in . I found myself saying to myself about this one and that : What 's resting heavily insidep244you ? What 's gnawing at your heart ? ' You see , people like us in the hospital have other worlds to live in . They may sound crazy to those who do n't understand them , but they 're worlds all the same , and often they 're far easier and happier ones to live in than the real world outside . " She paused to scan my mother 's face . " Does all this sound queer and strange to you ? " she asked . " Not at all , " my mother said calmly . " I 've thought the same , too , when I 've been in great mobs of people as we were on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fears weighed upon my mind , too . " " I 'm glad , " Mrs. Gowan said . " I would n't wish to be just alone with this kind of thoughts , but if you have them , too , I ca n't be so far wrong . " " Was Charley Bright 's real world outside a hard one for him to live in ? " I asked Mrs. Gowan . My mother looked startled then , as though she thought I might well be helping Mrs. Baxter ; but she relented when she saw how much I wanted to hear about Charley Bright 's real world . " Yes , it was , " Mrs. Gowan said . " His only little boy died , and I do n't think he was very happy with his wife , though he was careful never to say that . I 'm sure that his real world was one reason why he selected specially helpful space-takers in his newspaper so they might give courage to all sorts of people in their real worlds with all their private sorrows . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean about other worlds to live in . One day , when I was walking about the hospital grounds , I found a tiny white feather clinging to a bush . It was fluffy as though it had once belonged to a baby bird . I took it indoors and gave it to her , and ever since then it 's given her great comfort . She sits for hours in her room changing that feather from one finger to another byp245means of just a few smears of glue . It looks odd enough to people who do n't understand , but it 's very real to her . It 's a means of moving her about among her nicer memories and thoughts . Sometimes it takes her back to Ireland in her happier days there , and at other times , she says , it carries her far farther away than Ireland . That white feather has provided her with any number of different worlds to live in . " " I wish I knew Mrs. McCarthy , " my mother said impulsively . " Well , you shall , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come with your husband . He 's a great comfort to Mrs. McCarthy . She likes him much better than she likes a rather sober old priest who visits her and leaves her holy pictures and what she calls medals . Perhaps you could tell her things about Queen Victoria that she does n't know . Queen Victoria and Mrs. McCarthy were girls together ; and even though the Irish , she says , are n't disposed to like the English overmuch on account of what she calls the troubles ' that happened long ago , she just loves the old Queen . Some days she 's a waiting woman in one of the Queen 's palaces or castles , lifting the Queen 's feet up on a hassock or bringing her a nice cup of tea . That 's one of her most cherished worlds , and that little white feather can take her there in no time at all . " " I could tell Mrs. Gowan about the pennies at the Golden Jubilee , " I said to my mother . " Mrs. McCarthy might like to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother said . " It 's a nice story , Mrs. Gowan , and meanwhile I 'll see whether there 's anything to eat in this house except preserves and piccalilli . " The sun burst through the clouds and mist as I proudly told Mrs. Gowan about the offering of the pennies by all the women in England . Its light suffused her face in her chair byp246the window and lent added glow to her eyes as she listened intently . " Every woman in England gave a penny to the Queen , Mrs. Gowan , " I said . " Even the very poorest , and in all the country places as well as in the cities . If they could n't get new and shining ones , they polished up the old with scouring powder . Each one wrapped her penny in a bit of tissue paper , and each one took it to the vicar in every parish on a certain day . That was in 1887 for Queen Victoria 's Golden Jubilee after fifty years . Ansie and I were n't born then , but we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though we were . " Mrs. Gowan intertwined her fingers in delight . " How Mrs. McCarthy will love that ! " she cried . " She 'll spend hours counting all those pennies with the Queen . It will be still another world for her to travel to ! " The two days of haying were filled with matchless pleasurefor us all . Mrs. Gowan glowed and sparkled with such delight that Mrs. Baxter feared the results of such animation in one of so many years . She ardently prescribed some camomile tea for Mrs. Gowan as an early twentieth-century tranquillizer , but her suggestion was received with such summarydisposal that she felt presumptuous as well as deflated . " She 's the beatingest creature I ever laid my eyes on , " she declared to Mary and me as we dried the breakfast dishes for her on the morning of the mowing . " If anyone had told me three brief years aback that I 'd be hobnobbing with an old woman from an insane asylum who 's got more brains than I 've got and twice the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm giving you my solemn word when I say I 've learned a heap in three brief years in this parsonage . " " About us , too ? " I asked with real curiosity . " Or just aboutp247Mrs . Gowan ? " " Truthfully , Mrs. Baxter , " Mary said , " were n't you a little worried about us all , just at the beginning ? " Mrs. Baxter somewhat furiously dashed the wire soap shaker about in her pan of hot dishwater . " Well , " she said , " I 'm compelled to say I did have my doubts  --  that is , after Reverend Perkins . I was n't used to foreigners , as you might say , and I did n't know how I 'd take to them , or for that matter how they 'd take to me . " " Frankly , Mrs. Baxter , " Mary said , " you were more than a little overpowering just at first , or perhaps overwhelming is a better word . " " You seem to be taking a fancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , still swishing the soap shaker . " Yes , I am , " Mary said . " We 're studying vocabulary now in English , and we 're supposed to familiarize ourselves with a great many exceptional words and use them , too , in our everyday speech . " " I see , " said Mrs. Baxter . " What was Reverend Perkins like ? " I asked hastily . " That 's a most for-naidable question to answer , " Mrs. Baxter said , glowering slightly at Mary . " A real tough one in just ordinary talk . He was a good man enough , but sort of peak-ed in all his ways as though he 'd given up the battle from the start . Perhaps it 's easier just to say that he was n't one jot or tittle like your father . And as to his wife , she was n't any more like your mother than a worm is like a humming-bird . " " What about the children ? " I persisted . " Pale , " Mrs. Baxter said . " Puny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ansie ? " " He 's out waiting for Mr. Johnson to come with the oxen , " I said . " And Mrs. Gowan is out gathering flowers top248put on their horns . " Mrs. Baxter received this latter information with marked forbearance . " Trust her , " she said , " for any number of outlandish notions . Still , if I know the Johnsons , they 'll enjoy it all , and it 'll be a change from the humdrum . I had a chance to set them straight about Mrs. Gowan on Sunday after church . And they are n't like some folks , shut up tight in their minds and nosy about anything a bit queer or out of the common . Leastways , Caleb Johnson is n't , and I can tackle her . " Mary suddenly looked belligerent . I remembered Susan Pratt and the battle in the schoolyard . " You do n't mean that people would dare to criticize father , do you ? " she asked . " About Mrs. Gowan or anything else ? " " Not with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm through with them , they 're ready to say with everyone else that he 's the best man this church has ever seen . It 's just that some are a mite slow to take in a new idea . They 're like all Maine coast folks , and especially the Methodist variety . But do n't you worry . I 'll take care of them . " She paused . " I 've been set upon by a brand-new idea myself the past few days . What would you say to having a real Harvest Home Supper in the barn tomorrow evening after the hay 's in and all fragrant-like , up in the haymow ? I thought as how it might please your father , like them old days in England that he sets such store by . And Mrs. Gowan , too . She 'd probably go into a regular tizzy over it . I thought as how we 'd get those trestle tables from the church . Ansie and Mr. Johnson could fetch them in the hayrack , and we 'd have it as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my good spruce beer in place of ale , and I 'm planning on a prime roast of beef , costly as ' t is , with Yorkshire puddings , and some sausages thrown in . It 'll mean a heap more work , but with you two girls andp249Mrs . Johnson to help me out , I think it 's worth it . Come haying time , I can see that your father gets homesick for the old ways of England . " " Does mother know ? " I asked Mrs. Baxter . " No , she do n't , but she 'll be for anything that pleases your father . She may get a mite frisky now and again , but trust her when it comes to him . I saw that from the minute you all got here on September the loth in the year 1901 . " " So that was the date , " Mary said reflectively . " Yes , ' t was , " Mrs. Baxter said . " I only remember how strange it all seemed , " Mary said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Not exceptionally , " Mrs. Baxter said , carefully rounding her unusual adverb . " But I 'm not likely to forget that one . " Mary and I were ecstatic over Mrs. Baxter 's surprise for my father and would have thrown our arms around her at that very moment had we not seen that she was getting confused and uneasy over her rare wealth of confidence . Insteadwe joined Ansie at the entrance to the driveway and watched for the Johnsons to appear with the oxen and with the mowing machine in tow . They were the upcountry Methodists who had given us Primrose and Cowslip and , their own haying completed , were coming for two days to help us out with ours . The July sunshine was strong and dazzling in its brightness . There was no sign of mist or even of cloud . Mrs. Gowan , plaiting her flowers on the orchard bench , waved to us in ecstasy . She had been astir since daybreak . My father walked about the barn excitedly , clad in his blue shirt and blue-and-white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stowing of the hay . Through the open chamber windows we heard my mother singing as she made a room ready for the Johnsons . The song-sparrows and the white/throats trilled and whistled from the pasture and the woods beyond . We could hear the clatter and rattle of the mower along the stony country road even before it came into sight over the brow of the hill . Mrs. Johnson sat in the wagon driving their horse and towing the machine ; and behind her piled on the back seat rose a sharp , shining conglomeration of pitchforks , scythes , and hayrakes . Her best black hat with its ostrich plume over the crown , for after all she was going visiting , looked somewhat out of place backed by so many rude and dangerous implements . Mr. Johnson followed with the hayrack and the oxen , walking beside them with his long goad-stick over their broad backs . They plodded along heavily on their short , gnarled legs , their red muscular shoulders heaving , their huge , patient heads moving rhythmically from left to right , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were the finest yoke throughout a wide countryside , as everyone knew ; and Mr. Johnson , in a worn linen duster over his shirt and overalls , guided them with great pride . Unlike most oxen , who seemed inevitably to bear the names Star and Bright , they were called John and Charles after the Wesley brothers . Mr. Johnson was a man of humour and imagination , who from the first had delighted my father . He , too , had a feeling for tradition and the long past . His grandfather had been an early itinerant Methodist preacher , and the naming of the oxen was an artless , perhaps even sly tribute to his own inheritance . Ansie tore away up the road to greet our guests and helpers and to beg Mr. Johnsonto let him wield the goad , while Mrs. Gowan , her floral decorations for John and Charles completed , came running to join Mary and me , her blue eyes filled with joy and expectation . What a wonderful two days it was ! First , the mowing itself ,  |p251the  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clicking knives of the machine , the swish and heavy hiss of the scythes in the corners of the field and around the few trees , the drone and hum of the hones on the scythe blades as my father and Mr. Johnson paused in the hot sunshine to sharpen them after the mower had completed its task and John and Charles rested from their work . They were acquiescentand complacent under Mrs. Gowan 's garlands . Perhaps they even enjoyed this bit of gaiety in the light of their early sacrifice of love to mere labour . At all events they chewed their fresh hay under the trees with placid acceptance of their past and present fates . In the afternoon while the July sun blazed down upon the shorn field we all helped in spreading , turning over the swaths with our forks so that every blade and spear of fallen grass could dry under the heat and light . Mrs. Baxter mixed gallons of cold molasses and ginger water , which she called " swipes " and which we all drank gratefully in intervals from our work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the bright day moved on slowly toward its close . " There 's nothing like the smell of new-mown hay , " Mr. Johnson said , wiping his mouth with his hairy brown hand after a draught of swipes . " I reckon that 's what 's kept me an uphill farmer all my life . " My brother Ansie on that first day of haying seemed suddenly to burst out of boyhood . He wore a pair of overalls like my father and Mr. Johnson ; and with his shirt open at the neck and his yellow hair blowing in the light wind , he strode importantly about the field , taller than either of them , wieldinghis pitchfork like one possessed , tireless , skillful , scornful of mere girls who were framed to carry refreshment to men rather than to spread hay . To his vast delight Mr. Johnson had allowed him to wield a scythe for the first time , and hep252did it with such strength and care that even my father looked upon him with new respect . I caught my mother watching him from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look almost of fear in her face . After a warm , dewless night the hay was turned over and spread once again before it was ready to be shaped into cocks . John and Charles lumbered about the pasture with Lilla , Snow White , the sheep , and the Johnson mare , Jenny Lind , by their very size completing the manorial aspect of our domain , my father said ; for since Mr. Johnson had been unable to bring both the mower and the raking machine , the raking was done by hand . Mrs. Gowan in an old pink sunbonnetof Mrs. Baxter 's insisted on making a few cocks . She seemed indestructible , my mother said , and so happy in the sun that she added to its light . In the kitchen Mrs. Johnson lent her capable hands to Mrs. Baxter , who , warned hourly by Ansie , knew that she could not forsake the treading of the loads . At two o'clock John and Charles took their places on either side of the great wooden shaft that drew the hayrack ( the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the haymakingreached its joyous climax . Four of us made the loads , Mrs. Baxter , Mrs. Gowan , Mary , and I , stumbling from back to front of the long grey rack , falling , laughing , pressing down the forkfuls as they were thrown over the high sides , colliding with one another , burying ourselves in hay . Ansie pitched this year with the other men , though when the load was heaped and ready , he bounded up on top and rode to the barn , through the field , skirting the orchard , on the way to the great open doors below the loft . Up there with us all he suddenly became a little boy again . " Sing , Mrs. Gowan ! " he cried each time the great load started . " Now 's the time for Harvest Home ! "  |p253Mrs  . Gowan 's joy was complete . She disdained to lie down on the hay as the others of us were doing when once the straining oxen went on their way toward the barn . Instead she stood beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitchfork plunged deep in the load . Her voice , broken by laughter , rang out with his through the warm air : " Merry , merry , merry , merryHarvest Home ! " As I watched her there , with Ansie 's arm holding her steady against the joltings of the rack , bits of hay clinging to her white hair , her cheeks flushed , her eyes wide and shining , I thought of her long ago , a girl like Mary and me , riding on top of the Aroostook farmer 's load , living her rare bright hour in the midst of her dark , terrifying years . Now , at least for the time being , no trace of those dark years remained . That one bright hour of her childhood had flowed over them like some clear stream to join with these hours of the present . Mr. Johnson drove his oxen ; my father , singing lustily , stalked proudly beside his laden racks ; my mother trailed behind , singing , too , as with her wooden rake she gathered up the few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made our triumphal processions toward our waiting red barn . I do n't know whether my father or Mrs. Gowan enjoyed more Mrs. Baxter 's Harvest Home Supper under our closely packed mows in the long summer twilight . She sat beside him , insatiable for songs and stories . He insisted that Mrs. Baxter take the foot of the long table in my mother 's usual place ; and Mrs. Baxter , crimson from treading hay and from putting the finishing touches to her feast , was too flustered and happy to remonstrate . Mrs. Gowan had crowned us all with circlets of ripened redtop and timothy as befitted the occasion ; and Mrs. Baxter for once was too pleased with herself to feelp254embarrassed by her Bacchanalian appearance in the presence of the Johnsons . They , though clearly unaccustomed to such festivity , glowed with new pleasure like those who , late in life , have discovered something rich and strange and ardently regret that they had not known it before . Mrs. Johnson from her seat next Mrs. Baxter kept staring at Mrs. Gowan , who obviously was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom she had known all her life , was in this new role beyond her ken likewise , she was consumed by two poles of slightly suspicious interest . There were speeches , toasts to Old Englandand to New , one to Katie , proposed by Ansie , and another to our Tillyard grandparents . Ansie sent his plate up for so many helpings that my mother despaired of his free fees at Exeter ever covering his appetite ! Mrs. Gowan alone seemed to have no desire to eat . From her place beside my father she kept gazing at us all . She was blissful , enraptured . When the sunlight , streaming through the western windows of the barn , had faded , and the hermit thrushes began to sound from the pasture , and my father remembered with reluctance the nightly chores , he invited her as our guest of honour to make the final speech . She rose to her feet then in a silence not untinged , I fear , by apprehension on the part of us all . We need not have worried . She moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been bestowing a blessing . Her voice was clear and strong , and her white head , tilted toward the left , was high . " I 've never made a speech before , " she said , " or what you call a toast ; but here 's to long life and gladness to us all in this house of God that 's merry and full of grace . Here 's to Mrs. McCarthy and Charley Bright , and the good doctors in the hospital , and the oxen John and Charles , and our neighbours who have come to help us , and my new family ,  |p255one  and all . All I can think of is my space-taker which I 've thought of since the day broke and which was put in the newspaper just for me : Night 's candles are burnt out , and jocund day Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops . " " Whatever was that poor crazy soul from that insane asylum talking about ? " I heard Mrs. Johnson say to Mrs. Baxter as Mary and I were helping to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while my mother and Mrs. Gowan were having the far more pleasant task of taking some rewarding lumps of sugar to John and Charles in the pasture . Mrs. Baxter 's face grew stern under her redtop and timothy . " She 's not poor and she 's not the least bit crazy , " she said to Mrs. Johnson , who cowered perceptibly beneath her onslaught . " And in this house we do n't say asylum . We say hospital . And we never  --  and I mean never , mind you  --  use the words insane or crazy . She was talking about things we all know and folks we think highly of . So do n't go wasting your pity on her , for she do n't need a mite of it . " " But she recited a poem that did n't mean a thing to me , " Mrs. Johnson managed to say weakly as she began to scrape the plates in her confusion . " Well , why not ? " Mrs. Baxter asked almost savagely . " We say lots of poetry in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shakespeare . If you  --  and I , " she conceded unwillingly , " do n't know much about him , that 's just our own bad luck . " The autumn and winter that followed Mrs. Gowan 's second sojourn with us in the summer of 1904 were filled with utmost satisfaction for us all . In spite of the early cold which took the fishing boats from the water to be propped andp256canvased high on the beach or hauled into the more commodiousfish-houses against the winter , in spite of the ice which closed the harbour and halted the building of vessels , and the snow brought by mighty northeast gales , we lived in a state of almost perpetual excitement and pleasure . First , there was Ansie at his school in Exeter . He was very good about writing home , having been warned by my father that full and frequent news of his doings and wellbeingwould especially delight my mother . Whenever a letter reached Pepperell , brought by the mail-stage in the late afternoon , my father was waiting to claim it at the post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , we all gathered in the sitting-room to hear it read . Mrs. Baxter even left her preparations for supper , coming in rosy from the kitchen in her white apron . She usually brought Chessy with her , whose sedate behaviour during the reading was sure proof , Mrs. Baxter said , that she took in far more about Ansie than any of us could possibly surmise . Supper was always late on the days of Ansie 's letters since we were given to commenting on practically every statementin each of them . His roommate was named Thomas Jefferson Ferris . This name elicited remarks from my father on his own devotion to that remarkable Virginian , who , in some way of course , had determined Tom 's name , although Ansie had seemingly not yet discovered it . Ansie had joined the school choir , which encouraged singing in spite of squeaks and quavers as boys ' voices changed . He was more than a little heartsick at not having been chosen for the football squad . He thought it was because he was too thin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mother said . " At least we do n't haveto worry this autumn about that wretched , dangerous game . " The food at Exeter was excellent , on the whole , althoughp257baked beans figured rather heavily ; and whenever these were mentioned , Mrs. Baxter conceived the notion of sending yet another box of really good and nourishing food . " Beans are prime for church suppers and Saturday nights , " she said , " but not in too great quantities for a growing boy . " " Now , Mrs. Baxter , " my father expostulated , " you know what the special circular to parents said about too many boxes from home . " Mrs. Baxter was clearly not only unconvinced , but quietly recalcitrant . We would all be surprised at Christmas , one November letter said , by Ansie 's new school jacket of the proper Exeter cut and colour . He had almost asked my father for it ; but when he found that it cost six whole dollars , he and Tom , who also had hesitancy over the matter of money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and they had sold so much popcorn at the football game with Andover that they had proudly bought their own jackets . My father glowed with pride and enthusiasm over this announcement. " vVhat a country this is ! " he said . " Now that 's one thing he could n't have done at an English public school . " " Why not ? " Mrs. Baxter asked . " It 's quite too complicated to explain now , Mrs. Baxter , " my father said . " I 'll try sometime later . " " I do wonder if he 's growing any taller , " my mother said . " I surely hope not . He 's nearly six feet already . I do wish he 'd say . " " Well , he wo n't , my dear , " my father said , " unless we put it specifically on our list of questions . It just would n't occur to him that we care how he looks . " " It will by and by , " Mary said with annoying wisdom . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be thinking aboutp258girls , and then will he care ! " " Do n't be so stupid ! " I said hotly . " Ansie 's got more sense than you think . " Mary looked loftily at me . " It 's not a matter of sense , " she said calmly . " It 's just  --  well , it 's just plain biology . " " Biology ! " said Mrs. Baxter with reproachful contempt . " It seems to me some folks around here are getting too big for their boots ! " " Stop talking , all of you , " my mother said , " and let father read on . What about the list of questions we sent ? Has he forgotten to answer those ? " Ansie was often brief in his answers to the prepared questionswhich my mother sent him each week , including carefullythose of deepest interest to my father . Yes , he was doingquite decently in his Greek , and his teacher was really a good sort even if , because of his protruding ears , he was known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , he was not neglecting to brush his teeth twice each day . Yes , he had copped an excellent mark from his English teacher for an essay on " Harvest Customs in Suffolk " ( suggested by my father ) though it was no end of a bore to have to read it aloud in class with the fellows tittering audibly over his accent . He was more detailed in his answer to an earlier question of my father 's about migrating birds in southern New Hampshire . " I really ca n't say much about the birds , " he had written . " Exeter boys do n't go about gazing into trees and bushes . One rather queer fellow did just after school opened , and he 's been called Tweet , tweet ' ever since . I 'm sure father would n't want me called Tweet , tweet . ' It 's quite all right to look at birds at home , but not at school . " Aside from Ansie 's letters there were other exciting events.  |p259Mrs  . Bridget McCarthy sent me a really beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands , together with a letter thanking me for my story about the Queen 's Jubilee pennies . It had given her great delight , she said , and now she and Queen Victoria often counted the pennies together , making tall , shining piles of them in Buckingham Palace where two footmen in bright red coats arranged the piles on a long table . At their last count they had made 120 , - 000 pennies . She would be most deeply obliged , she said , if my father at his entire convenience would tell her the value of 120,000 British pennies in dollars and cents since for some odd reason her girlhood arithmetic in Ireland had slipped from her mind . After my father and I had worked it out for her and I had written that the sum would be in the near neighbourhood of $2,500 , she wrote again to thank us . Now she could better advise Queen Victoria , she said , just how to spend such a tremendous gift . Mrs. Gowan , between my father 's visits to the hospital , which were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a steady correspondent . When she did not write of hospital doings , or review the joys of her visits to us , or anticipate those to come , she sent us copies of Charley Bright 's space-takers . And in late January , when my mother longed for mist and rain and even for a wind from Russia in the place of continued bright and bitter cold , when Ansie had returned to school after the most wonderful of Christmas holidays , we were all overcome by a letter from Charley Bright himself to Mary , suggesting that she not only select some space-takers for his columns , but , since he had heard from Mrs. Gowan that she composed poetry , send him some samples of her work , which it was just possible , though in no sense sure , he might wish to print in his newspaper . Mary was in such a state of rapture that my mother likenedp260the parsonage sitting-room to the Poets ' Corner in WestminsterAbbey , which metaphor , once it had been explained to Mrs. Baxter , gave even her a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and critical study of Mary 's effusions , three were chosen , copied by Mary 's impressed English teacher on the academy typewriter , and posted to Charley Bright . Whereupon there ensued a period of such anxiety , expectation , and dread that Mrs. Baxter declared we were all headed for a state of complete decline . Charley Bright actually kept us in frightful suspense for only a week . A long envelope , ominous in its very shape and size , came from him one February evening when the mercury was still below zero . When my father brought it in and wordlessly laid it on the sitting-room table , his face was a study in fear and compassion lest disappointment and discouragementfor his first-born were concealed within it . I have always remembered him standing there , tiny beads of water gradually replacing the frost on his eyebrows , his eyes imploring my mother for understanding and probable comfort , his face worn with concern for everyone except himself . In a paralyzed group we stared at the envelope until Mrs. Baxter said the time had come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever the cost . Then Mary , with trembling fingers , opened it to find three one-dollar hills in payment for her three poems and the promise of early publication . And just how , asked Charley Bright , did the youthful poet wish her really excellent verses signed ? My mother , with the streak of realism always marked within her , kept saying throughout the winter that we really could n't expect everything to militate in our favour . That was not the way life worked , she said . We could n't alwaysp261expect beer and skittles , forever live on top of the world . We must fortify ourselves for a change in our emotional climate . I am sure the change came with the early spring though , since it chiefly concerned my father , we children were not for some time too cognizant of it or deeply affected by it . In late April or early May , when the peepers had begun to sound in the twilight and the pair of robins had returned to the woodbine over the side door , my parents fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by themselves . Nor did I need Mrs. Baxter 's anxious information to be aware that they stole down to her kitchen frequently in the dead of night to brew some cups of tea . " Mark my words , something 's eating away at both of them , " she said to Mary and me , " and it 's my guess it stems from that Conference in March , on Fast Day , when your father went to Bangor . " Mrs. Baxter as usual was right , although , whatever her apprehensions , she did not know how closely her own future might be concerned with the consequences of several interviewsin Bangor . She was quite aware , however , that serious deliberations were taking place between my parents ; and she was wise enough to conclude that my mother was more deeply engrossed in these and perturbed by them than was my father . In this conclusion she was also right . My father was simply not framed to be overly troubled for himself over what certain Methodist district superintendentsin Bangor had had to say about a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obvious talents . Time and place were important to him only in so far as specific human beings might be closely involved in them . In themselves they were relatively incidental , being only the sphere in which one moved and to which one gave one 's all . A man might , of course , prefer one sort of environment to another as he hadp262preferred the idea of America to the actuality of England , or as the country possessed a language for him which a city could never speak ; yet no merely physical locality loomed large in his thoughts except as a glowing symbol , like Bury St. Edmunds or Walden Pond . The dwelling place of a man 's mind was everything , but not the whereabouts of his body . Nor was he deeply disturbed by the awkward and halting advice of these same superiors in Bangor upon his unusual and perhaps unwise activities in behalf of certain unfortunate persons who , in God 's inscrutable scheme of things , seemed destined for tragedy and sorrow . I am sure he did not hesitate to state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tragedy and sorrow and perhaps in so doing increased their anxiety as to the wisdom of their bishop 's eager importation of him four years earlier . American Methodism at the turn of the century was committed to sound doctrine and to solid practice , to thriving Sunday schools , weekly prayer meetings , missionary labours abroad , and yearly revival seasons at home . It was not accustomed to odd parsons who held peculiar and upsetting convictions about man 's intimate obligations to his fellow man under whatever sort of circumstances , not to mention quite unorthodox opinions about the redemption of the human soul in its ageless and turbulent history . My mother may , indeed , have felt some measure of sympathywith the puzzled district superintendents . After all , she had lived with my father for nearly twenty years . Yet , although her practical and far more literal mind could not entirely fathom the reflections and affirmations of his own , she was as committed to him with all his vagaries as he was committed to his lovely , if unworldly ambitions . The burden of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tea in the small hours , as we were to learn later when wep263were let into their secret , was the effects which a change in pastorates might have not only upon us children and Mrs. Baxter , but even more especially upon my father 's hopes and desires , most of which at the moment concerned his friends at the hospital , and mainly Mrs. Gowan . Once Ansie had returned in June from school , not any taller to my mother 's intense relief , but unquestionably older in his ways and thoughts , and Mary had graduated from the academy with so many honours and awards that we were all quite dizzy with pride , we held a family council in the orchard where the last of the apple blossoms had given place to tiny and fuzzy pale-green apples and the grass in the field beyond was already ripening under the warm sun . The clatter of tins and china in the kitchen and the occasional energetic hurlings of pails of grey soapsuds on the shrubs and bushes at the side door proved that Mrs. Baxter was happily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her spring cleaning . Our gathering was not actually planned as a council to ponder over my father 's future , but rather to take careful stock of our financial assets in view of Mary 's . In spite of my mother 's painfully compiled list of figures , which had engaged her attention for weeks and which failed utterly to reach the $boo necessary for mere tuition and board for Mary , my father had determined that she was to enter in the autumn the Massachusetts college of her dreams . " I just do n't see how it 's going to be managed , " my mother said , a little petulantly since she was by nature averse to figures and dead-sick of adding and subtracting them . " Nor do I , " my father said , " but curiously enough I 'm sure it will be . I 've always believed that if a thing is unquestionablyright to do , one just goes ahead and does it , no matter how impossible or even mad it seems at the moment . "  | " You do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a tone of more than faint exasperation . My father looked distressed . " How short are we ? " Ansie asked , bending over my mother 's papers on the orchard table . " Two hundred dollars at the very least , " my mother said , " and we 're not even thinking of books and clothes and railway tickets . " Mary looked aggrieved and even angry . " We would n't be adding up and worrying at all , father , " she said , " if you had n't been so stubborn about that hotel in Bar Harbor . I could have earned at least one hundred dollars and probably a lot more . " " I 'm sorry , " my father said , " but I do n't like summer hotels , and I like less our not being together for as long as we can . " " And you 're not to blame just your father for that decision , " my mother said loyally . " I did n't like it either , as you know very well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subject rest , though not too pleasantly . " Well , you do n't any of you need to worry about me , " Ansie said . " I have n't told you yet , but I 've got a job in the Exeter library for two hours a day . That 's nearly five dollars a week besides my scholarship . I wo n't need so much as a penny from home all next year . " " Good ! " my father said . " That 's fine , Ansie . I am proud . " My mother smiled at Ansie with the special illumined smile always reserved only for him . " I 've got fifteen dollars in my bank , " I said , " from pickingblueberries and my prize at school . Add that on , mother . " " No , do n't , mother ! " Mary said . She was still sulky , butI knew that underneath it all she was grateful , thoughp265she glared at me . " I 'm not taking any of my sister 's money . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She wants you to take it , like Tom 's sister . His sister sent him twenty dollars that she 'd earned tutoring at college . He was quite in a rage at first and vowed he would n't touch it  --  with a ten-foot pole , he said  --  but after we 'd talked it over , he realized that it would be mean and unkind not to take it . " " Tom must be a nice boy , " my mother said . " When is he coming to visit us ? Did you say at haying time ? " " He 's tops , " Ansie said . He looked troubled at my mother 's question . " I do n't know just when he 's coming . When 's Mrs. Gowan coming ? Would it be all right if he came after Mrs. Gowan ? " " Why , of course , " my mother said , sensing his anxiety . " He can come any time at all . " My father was studying Ansie 's face and so seriously that Ansie did not wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Mrs. Gowan , " he said . " He thinks it 's fine that we have her visit us and all that , but all the same he does n't quite see just , why we do those things . I 'm afraid I was n't too good at explaining . I 'm afraid I rather put it all on you , father . I 'm sorry . " " Well , that 's just where it belongs , I daresay , Ansie , " my father said cheerfully , but with an apparent effort . " No , it does n't , " my mother said quickly . " I invited Mrs. Gowan . I wo n't have your father held responsible for all that we do here which may seem a bit out of the common . He has to bear enough of it , as it is , but at least I 'll take my share when it comes to Mrs. Gowan . Iler coming was my idea , so will you all please remember that . And I have n't regretted it for one moment either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face alight with love and admiration . At fourteen I was on the threshold
