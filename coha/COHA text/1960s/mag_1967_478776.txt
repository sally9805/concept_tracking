What happens between lawyer and client today goes something like this : The lawyer sits at the elbow of the businessman while contracts are being negotiated , that is , while a deal is being made . Then , once the principals feel an agreement has been concluded , the lawyers assure them it has not . After much further negotiation , the lawyers " draft the contract " ? reduce the deal to written late ? and pass it back and forth accompanied in each passage by increasingly minute argumentation ( e.g. , " W We believe in all fairness that the law 3f Luxembourg should govern in the event of nonperformance under Para . V(c) ( ii ) " etc. , etc . ) . Once they have decided that neither party can be further hoodwinked or bullied , the typist prepares many copies to make " doubly sure " ( making doubly sure in this special fashion is 28 per cent of law practice ) , and the clients sign all of them . Then they smile at each other and shake hands , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( it 's part of the fee-action ) . This little drama , in numerous manifestations , is the beginning of law ? perhaps , even , the final heart of it as well . Lawyers and clients do n't really like one another . Oh , they act friendly enough ? they play golf , eat and drink , nightclub together , and so on . But they really ca n't like each other : the forces that bring them together preclude it . The client owns things or has power or both , but he comes to the lawyer because he needs the latter 's brains and savvy to protect and otherwise make sense out of what he owns or controls . In brief , the client feels , If you 're so smart , why are n't you rich ? While the lawyer ( knowing that this is the way the other feels ) reverses the proposition and replies silently , Since you 're so rich , why are n't you smart enough to do without me ? There is another aspect to the relation , A very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Do n't , " he said . " You 'll get terribly bored with it . It wo n't hold you , intellectually . " I tried *David Itiesman.to explain how ambitious I was trying to be ; that I was already fairly well bored with being an unplaced , general-purpose intellectual ; and I added , somewhat petulantly , that everybody had always said I would make a good lawyer . " Okay , " he said , " but go home and ask yourself one question , very seriously ? are you a big enough son of a bitch ? Because that 's really what it takes ? not to practice law , but to like it . The lawyer is a kind of witch-doctor , a shaman , to the American businessman . The client comes to you feeling guilty about what he 's done or is getting ready to do , and one of the things he is paying you for is to carry his guilt for him . He 's going to leave that in your office with the rest of his problem , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ client is the one who has convinced himself ? with your help ? that you are the thief , the conniver , the guilty party . You have to he a very aggressive son of a bitch to put up with that sort of thing . And unlike a psychoanalyst , you know , you 're stuck with the projection ? you do n't get a chance to straighten him out later on . " He was right , too , as I later found out . Anyway , I went home and thought about it , realizing with some embarrassment why it was that everybody had always said I would make a good lawyer , and I ended up convincing myself that the law was the only safe place for somebody with my special talents . As it turned out , compared to the very best in the field , I was only moderately well qualified . I may say , moreover , that I used up all my meanness during my time in the law and have been a sweet , David Bazelon has been a practicing corporate lawyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He has written extensively for magazines on political economy and related subjects , and contributes frequently to " Commentary . " His books include " The Paper Economy " ( 1963 ) and " Power in America : The Politics of the New Class " ( 1967 ) and , as a Guggenheim Fellow , he is currently working on a study of the role of lawyers in America . gentle , irrelevant , all-purpose intellectual ever since . Once in practice , my comprehension of the client took a very practical turn , since I did not find myself with a great deal of time for sociological speculation . While learning my trade I did note , however , that clients lie a great deal . In the arduous process of preparing for trial , for example , half the show is to entice your own man into revealing more than selected items of the story , and doing so sooner rather than later . A smart young lawyer soon recognizes what lies behind his client 's faulty memory and other fumbling : the guy is just marking time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win the case . Many clients seem to feel that is the only clear and substantial reason for hiring a lawyer in the first place . Anyway , it 's the reason they understand best ( and are most prepared to pay for ) . This kind of interview can easily degenerate into an extremely sophisticated ballet , since the lawyer must know the facts in order to advise as to which fabrication will earn the fee ( a really good lie , after all , is only an edited version of the truth ) , but he wants the client to take full responsibility for the lie . Otherwise you get blamed morally as well as financially if the case is lost . ( Perjury charges , much less convictions , are extremely rare in civil actions . ) A style worthy of Diaghilev has been worked out whereby the attorney says , wistfully , " Gee , that 's too bad . If he had offered the money when your wife ? in fact , any witness " ( brief pause ) ? " was still in the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As it is , we 're stuck with quantum meruit " ? the latter made to sound like rubbery pizza . There are infinite variations on this little pas de deux . Of course , not everybody is a toe dancer . A colleague once told me of a flat-footed client who answered , in effect , " Okay , my wife was in the room , " followed by several minutes of awkward silence . Who 's Irrelevant ? As in all professional work , the activity of the lawyer breaks clown into two categories : ( I ) handling the client , and ( 2 ) doing the work . These can not be separated in fact ? that would jeopardize the fee and other interpersonal communication ? but must be kept distinct conceptually in order to accomplish the actual work . The point is that the client is not really very important but he does n't know this and , since he is incapable of believing it , you are not permitted to tell him , not even with a slightly elevated eyebrow . As a consequence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a wholly needful division of staff labor between the legal technician and the client-man . Unfortunately , the man who handles the client is closer to the source of income and so gets much more of it ( like premium pay for combat duty ) . Since the technician thinks he does all the " work , " this can create a very nasty situation within the office . In point of fact , this intraoffice tension is the price paid for the smooth front of professional mystique presented to the outside gullible world . What happens , without this division of labor , is that the client barges into the office , claps his hand to his forehead , and shouts , " He stole from me ! " or , " He 's going to steal from me ! " or , " I 'm having trouble stealing from him ! " - ' ? The client is very emotional , even though he may be dissembling . Very soon , if not immediately , it becomes clear just what he wants from you . If perchance you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) to go out and shoot his tormentor right now , then perhaps he will settle for some absolutely brand-new form of Chinese torture to be set in motion early tomorrow morning at the latest , and would you please describe it in exquisite detail now ; do n't rush , he has the rest of the afternoon to devote to this problem . If you are a client-man , you begin to sell him the sympathetic junk he wants . If you are a technician , you might , being frightened by his hysteria , begin to explain to him that the law does not always or so easily permit such forms of convenient homicide . Also , clients tend to get quite confused about whether they are appealing to a lawyer 's sense of justice , or his ordinary desire to get a little bit richer as soon as possible . Inexperienced men or young lawyers , who begin immediately to turn their minds from the " client-problem " to the problem-of-the-client , can be stampeded into forgetting the point of the whole matter as regards this special fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the lawyer needs from the client is certain selected facts ( selected by the lawyer , that is ) . But the client is filled with nagging irrelevancies , and quickly becomes a pest . He 's always on the phone wanting to know what 's happening , although if you told him the truth he *Better than 90 per cent of the problems in law practice have to do with money ? what we call property rights ? rather than with personal rights . In most places , criminal law is practiced as a professional obligation , since most criminals can hardly support themselves , much less a lawyer as well . Marital problems are handled by amateur psychiatrists , or as a professional favor to otherwise hopeful and well-heeled clients ; and civil rights and civil liberties are there for a handful of enthusiasts . 110 CLIENTS AGAINST LAWYERS would n't know what you were talking about , since he 's not a lawyer . So you turn him over to the client-man , if , happily , there is one around . If not , you turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more of That Stuff . But the client is irrelevant . I realize that there is no legal practice without clients , but still he is irrelevant to the actual work of the law ? when there is any other work than keeping the guy happy or well-conned . ( It should be perfectly obvious by now that I was no good at all when it came to peddling the mystique : no desk-side manner , so to speak . I had some kind of horrible compulsion to try to explain what was happening , and what I was going to do next , and matters like that . ) You Only Win the Case The key to the lawyer-client relationship is the way lawyers think . This is actually rather interesting for its own sake . Since the medieval headof-a-pin fellows were displaced , technical legal thought amounts perhaps to the most advanced and highly trained misuse of the human intelligence we have as yet achieved . The client is interested in his own actual situation ; the lawyer is interested only in translating that human situation into legal terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to learn how to do it in law school . For the first few months the process is very weird , and the student is quite disoriented . Then all of a sudden you get the point : nothing real is involved . What is substituted for " reality " is " winning the argument . " After you get going and when you get good at it , the less reality in the winning argument , the tastier it is . Many almost-good lawyers go under at this point -- something springs loose in their heads , they literally identify unreality with legal logic , and then they feel they must , poor souls , hull their way through the rest of their professional lives . They are perpetually recurring victims of a dream of the Completely Unreal Bullheaded Winning Argument . Put another way , it is one thing in law to figure out the substantial issues ? they usually come down to Did he or did n't he ? and How much ? ? and quite another to discover the points on which to fight out the case . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irrelevant to the human , or readily recognizable , substance of the case . For instance , in jockeying for the settlement price in a matter I worked on many years ago , it became important to get a court order to examine the president of the defendant corporation in New York rather than in Los Angeles . The former was inconvenient for him , and he was a man who liked his convenience , to say the least . We won the argument , with a fancy arrangement of precedents , by working out a noble theory about the perfect relationship between venue , state of incorporation , and principal place of business . ( It was so good I hardly understood it myself , although I created it . ) If we left the matter here , it would be very misleading because you would be free to imagine that winning the argument and defining reality were somehow still or eventually related , as in other areas of thought . In the law , they are not . That is because , in law , you never really win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , in fact , makes other good lawyers try twice as hard to win the argument on the other side the next time . In the law , you win the argument only by reference to the past , almost never by reference to present reality . ( When the latter happens , as in major revolutionary cases , scores of law review articles are written to prove that it did n't happen or should n't have happened ? in the best articles , both . ) This is the character of legal argument ? not the character of the best lawyers . Because ( I will finally admit it ) the best lawyers are exceptionally intelligent people , among the most intelligent our society permits to come into being They are the best because they know what they are doing instead of believing init . They have to , to win all the unreal arguments . The client , please note , does not win arguments ; he wins only things and conditions . What the laity considers to be the most distasteful characteristic of the lawyer ? his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any cause ? is exactly the measure of his achievement . In their own terms , lawyers elevate themselves professionally by arguing , at different times , opposite sides of the same great issue . Some achieve even more , and sit in judgment in the matter on a third occasion . This seeming triplicity is the ultimate in the law , for the lawyer ; but the general public is revolted . Perhaps the greatest difficulty the client has in understanding the law and the lawyer is that he can not get over his initial assumption that there is a major difference . There is none . The law is what lawyers do . Very goad lawyers , who know this , waste absolutely no time at all trying to find out what the law is ( and infinite time figuring out what the cases say , and can be made to say ) . They just do it , i.e. , go about trying to win another argument . Many unimaginative lawyers , it is true , slavishly imitate past winning arguments , from which derives the quaint notion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and are distinct from the lawyer making them . The greatest professional satisfaction comes from nibbling away at such ancient winners , and finally overturning them . ( Justice Holmes called this " the genius of the common law " ; he liked to talk like that . ) As a quick and important example , the clear old rule for the responsibility of corporate managers to stockholders ? the great winning argument of an earlier day ? had been to adapt the analogy of the strict accountability of a personal trustee . But corporations are much more complicated than personal trusts , and a series of smart , well-paid lawyers began to chew away at the edges of trustee accountability by frightening judges with the prospect of the detailed review of corporate affairs ( as in a trust accounting ) . Thus the principle arose that courts will not question matters of " business judgment . " This principle , which began as a minor exception , is now so dominant a winning argument that the only fun left is trying to prove that the business-judgment rule does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one outside of the law reviews even has time to suggest that this game he interrupted long enough to devise some relevant rules for corporate responsibility today . But Is Intelligence Enough ? Iused to have the recurrent fantasy , when I was practicing , that one day I would get out of the office-library and into court , carrying my own briefcase on a big matter involving some dramatic issue of justice ( not just which of the Bobbsey Twins got mommy 's money ) . My opening statement always began , " Now look , fellas . . . " and continued with a dazzling plea to the opposing attorney and the judge to join with me in a great creative human effort to knock off the professional happiness pills and dispose of this matter so as to further the progress of humanity and American culture , and save everybody a lot of time and wasted effort . It was really a major address in favor of nonlegal thought . This fantasy helped me to realize my deeper motivation : all I had ever wanted to be , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let somebody else tend the dogma ; somebody who was really interested enough in the power derived from an expert manipulation of it . Dogma and power , these are the two opportunities presented by the law as such . At the top of the profession , the first requires great technical accomplishment and consequently affords a technician 's deep satisfaction . The second , of course , has been the stuff of rulership throughout theages ; in the hands of a top-flight lawyer , it is today cleanly and beautifully sophisticated . As an extreme example of dogma in the law : a partner once caught me staring out of the window and as punishment gave me the crud-job of revising purchase-order " boilerplate . " This is the trade name for the fine print nobody reads ( it 's unreadable , on purpose ) which is printed on the back of contracts of sale . " Read " it sometime . It 's incredible ? an accretion of disclaimers derived from ancient but still nerve-wracking decisions on implied warranties , breaches entitling revocation , consequential damages , and similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a request to quote , an answering quotation of price , the final purchase order , and the post-final acceptance language on a shipping order , may well create such a bowl of legal chop suey that no one is able to sue on anything ; it 's much like two dinosaurs in ultimate and impossible approach , or two obese lovers who ca n't get close enough to smooch . In too great a degree , law is rationalism gone wild , rationalism as symptom . Oh , to romp in the green fields , away from the madness of men ! True enough , there are definite satisfactions available to members of the metropolitan legal elite . Some few lawyers even make some real money , even practicing law . But it is a demanding and even exhausting career . The distinctive advantage of the law is the opportunity to use your intelligence-as-trained in the course of each day . All skill involves intelligence , broadly defined ; what I refer to is intelligence narrowly defined , more specifically as the capacity of abstract reasoning and imagining : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good law office you have another chance to prove to yourself how smart you are , and to make a nice living while playing this game . But it is rather hard for a grown man to spend his whole life playing games with himself ; particularly such an egotistical one as proving again and again an element of superiority which you know you began with . After a time , one develops a strong desire to accept it as proven and get on to something more interesting or worthwhile or at least less enervating . In the law , this is mostly to move over into the client 's game in areas where intellectuals are reluctantly welcomed ? to take on a more direct participation in the system of business and state and other institutional power . There is a big change under way in the legal profession , which reflects the even bigger change in society : in general , toward the managerial preoccupations of administering a complex technological society . In brief , the elite lawyer is becoming 114 CLIENTS AGAINST LAWYERS a structural trouble-shooter in business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyer does , this is changing the nature of law itself . The law has become more a matter of administration , and is becoming noticeably less concerned with the proper tending of dogma . In the end , this process will possibly result in the creation of new dogma or ideology ; meanwhile , we have all become empiric ' Fits . The Intellectual Vanguard The legal world has become infinitely complicated and specialized since the New Deal ? all that legislation , all those administrative agencies , the war taxes , in sum , all those jobs , derived from all that rack of precedent . Not out of liberal commitment but just to keep one 's head above water , the whole legal process became unavoidably functional to an untoward degree . Many members of the legal elite have relied on this shift toward administration to move out from practice proper into governmental work and even politics ; to the law schools as a newly-paved road to advanced political and other institutional participation ; to executive-advisory positions directly with the institutions , whether corporate , charitable , foundation-academic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever . The effect of this has been that the lawyers have reconstituted themselves as the advance guard of the New Class in America . It is not advertising , magazine , or book publishing executives , not union or civil-rights activists , not movie or television producers , not teachers , stock salesmen , or new-money-men , and not even the foundation and academic hustlers ? but lawyers who remain the only general , inevitable and utterly practical vanguard of the intellectuals in the West . They will do anything , anywhere , and , if you pay extra , also come on for a five-a-day as the high priests of property and propriety , to the guaranteed satisfaction of any and all paying audiences . It is n't the oldest , but it is the most professional of professions . Doctors , for example , are inevitable idealists because , hard as they try and no matter how dollar-driven they may he , they can not get away from the anxious fact that animal existence depends on their work ; they can not avoid being the technicians of life-and-death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to stop the spread of spiritual infection ; this is so clear that it is sometimes hard to recall that many of them did not at the outset welcome their trained irrelevance as if it were some kindof fulfillment . But the lawyer , dealing almost always with the most pressing nonsense of the human race and almost always calling on his ultimate capacity of intelligence and word-use in the service thereof , is the one perfect professional . We 've been at this game a long time , you see ; and we 've gotten very good at it . Also , our product , all in all , is still more important in this country than these other and newer forms of morale-building . The dream of justice is still a greater dream than that of mouth-wash purity . Thurman Arnold , with Falstaffian tenderness , has said , The function of the law is not so much to guide society as to comfort it . " I would add : comfort in part by entertaining . We were the first entertainers on the frontier , only later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minstrels , and other con men . Law is an eternal dream , and indulging it as a form of personal expression remains one of the big differences between utterly bureaucratic societies . like Russia , and our messily bureaucratic one . The administrative mode will win out , of course ; but the better lawyers will exact a handsome price , in more ways than one . As always with the smart boys , the client pays .
