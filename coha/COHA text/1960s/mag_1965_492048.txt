By MYRON COPE " I got eight different pitches , " crows Wilmer Dean Chance , " including a sna ke ball , a su per snake bail and a one pronged fork ball . " Baseball 's slyest rube packs his pool cue wherever he goes , extracts $45,000 a year from a tough general manager and says he would pitch every day to win thirty games . Photographed hi/ Bill Bridges W Dean Chance . farmer , baseball pitcher and enfant terrible of the sporting scene , sat folded . nlo the right front seat , his bony knees almost to his chin . as the car sped north through the winter night toward Cleveland . To the journalist chauffeuring him , he declared , " You could call your story , The Most Exciting Pitcher Since Bobby Feller . You ever heard of a year like I had ? I led the league in wins , with twenty . I had the lowest earned-run average in both leagues-1.65 ? the lowest since 1943. and which by the way is only one one-hundredth from being the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the 1919 record held by Walter Johnson , but the difference seemed hardly worth an interruption . " My God , you could go back further and call your story . The Most Exciting Packer Strict . Dizzy Dean . Holy cow , I shut out the Yankees three times and another lime shut them out for fourteen innings before 1 got pulled for a pinch hitter . No pitcher in history ever did that . No man alive ever pitched like that . The Yankees averaged .089 bat ting against me . Talk about pressure . I 'm greatest under pressure . When I was a rookie , the largest crowd that seen me was 55.000 at Yankee Stadium , and I went the hell out there with the bases loaded and none out and blew down Howard . Skowron and Lopez on eleven fast balls . Fifty thousand seen me at the All-Star game last year , and I was the best damn pitcher out there . You could call the story , From Rags to Riches . Or how 's this ? The Greatest Year Errr ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His gray-green eyes , set in a baby-white face , focused straight ahead , as if the highway over which he roiled were Fred Haney , the Los Angeles general manager whom he has trampled in salary battles . In Wayne County , Ohio , he now owned 83 prime acres , 60 head of Angus and Hereford and 100 hogs , and he was getting 140 bushels to the acre on his corn yield . Pitching baseball for the Los Angeles Angels , he had seen the bright lights and been up late enough to watch them go out . Grandly , he now patted down his black hair , which had been styled in gorgeous waves by a Hollywood hairdresser recommended to him by his former teammate and fellow bon Pit. ( 1711 , Bo Belinsky . " Listen . " he tore on , " I led the league in innings pitched-278 . I gave up only seven home runs in Lhe whole 278 , which is phenomenal , and I would n't be surprised that it 's got to be a record , but no re:cords are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tied an all-time record held by Johnson and Hubbell . I pitched eleven shutouts , the most since 1920 . I had a lot of two-hitters and three-hittersyou can call Kaze , the publicity guy , and check that out . My earned-run average in home games was 1.00 , " Chance specified , converting the truth-1.08 ? into round figures . " Man , you ever heard statistics like mine ? You can call the story , The Farm Boy Makes Good . " Baseball season was corning on , but Chance was hell-bent to clean up the last of the banquet-circuit money ; on this swing he would go from Cleveland to New York to Philadelphia to Harrisburg . He wore his favorite ensemble  --  black overcoat , black suit , white shirt , black Lie , black socks , black shoes . " He looks like a divinity student , " a man had remarked at a banquet to Dick McCann , curator of the National Profcsional Football Hall of Fame . " You mean , " McCann had replied . " he looks like an altar boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Chance at Christmastime had appeared at his lawyer 's office in a powder-blue coat and burgundy necktie , demanding , ' ' Is n't this good-looking ? " The lawyer had answered . " We ought to sue the guy who sold it to you . " The Angels climbed from ninth place to fifth last year . and no small part of the reason was that the fashion plate , just turning 23 , pitched better than anyone else in baseball . He became the youngest player ever to win the Cy Young Award , a plaque that goes each year to baseball 's most valuable pitcher . Now . still reciting his deeds , Chance sang out : " In my last 57 innings against the Yankees , I gave ' em one run . One lousy run . I told Vic Power , ' Vic , I 'm gon na strike out Mantle this time ' ? and bang . Mantle hits one out of the park , the only stinking run they got all year off me . I should have won thirty games and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do n't know if it will get better this year , but it sure as hell ca n't get worse . Three games of mine they blew in the field . In one of them the little guy " ? presumably fivefoot-five outfielder Albie Pearson . though Chance in a burst of diplomacy would n't say ? " louses one up in the ninth . Nobody 's perfect , you ca n't blame them , but there 's three games . So I won twenty , and my God , I had a blister on my linger early in the season . I need one more big season , and I 'll go to Japan and pitch three exhibitions for twenty-five grand apiece . I do n't even want to think about winning thirty . Thirty ! Gosh , I 'd break my tail for thirty . I 'd pitch every day the last two weeks and go home every night and soak my arm in a bucket of hot water . You gon na use my picture on the cover ? You could put on the cover , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Great Money Pitcher . You put this story on the cover , and there ai n't nobody who 's not gon na read it . For crying out loud , I mean nobody . They pass it up , they 're a mental case . " The car pulled into a hotel near Cleveland-Hopkins Airport , and ' Chance went to bed , though not directly to sleep . After a thousand or so words , spoken in the darkness , he sighed , " Some of these ballplayers that go broke are such nice guys , it 's a crying shame to see them end up busted . I want that security . " So saying , he forthwith began to snore . The encomiums that Dean Chance showers upon himself can not properly be classified as bragging . Being the son of a midwestern dirt farmer , he is a tough horse trader , and he knows that one does not get the b:t price by calling attention to the animal 's spavined joints and loose teeth . Already he has reduced to shambles baseball 's traditional rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seniority . This year Fred Haney offered him 5.10. 000 . Chance countered with a demand for $50,000 , and sideline observers unanimously surmised the two men would compromise at $45,000 . Chance , however , made a point of defeating the sideline observers , making Haney cough up " just a pinch more " than $45,000 . His salary probably is the highest ever paid a 23-year-old baseball player . The fact is , Haney has found that negotiating with his rural uninderk.ind is like talking to a Missouri mule . Getting the money due him , explains Chance , is no different " than knowing the price of corn . " When he does not get it , he lays siege to Haney , blasting him in the newspapers till Haney wilts . Does the general manager resent such abuse ? " Not really , " says Haney , " because each time it happens he phones me and says he was misquoted . " In the end , Haney dares not tell his persecutor to spend the summer slopping hogs , for the young man is irreplaceable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he blossomed into a powerful pitching machine . All arms and legs , six feet three and 200 pounds , he winds up in a series of jerks , kicks and spasms , turns in the direction of center field , and without bothering to look at the batter till the last instant , whiplashes the ball at a speed that curls a batter 's hair . " It 's a god-awful delivery , " says Rocky Bridges , a former Angel coach . " He throws a lot of things at you and then the ball . " Most of all , Chance 's pitching style is characterized by his pugnacity , by the sheer joy he derives from the battle . Against Washington , in a late-season performance last year , he somehow gave the Senators the impression he was trying to break their skulls . Accordingly , when Chance himself strode to bat . Washington pitcher Bennie Daniels fired two pitches close to his head . " Everyone on the Washington team congratulated Daniels . " says Chance . proceeding with delight to the epilogue . " So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . I threw the ball a foot out of the batter 's box and still missed him by half a foot , that 's how fast he was running . I gins I put the point across to Mister Daniels . " American League batters fume that Chance throws illegal spitballs. secretly moistening the baseball while going through his strange windup . Baltimore slugger Brooks Robinson suggests , in fact , that Chance does so merely to satisfy a compulsive urge for mischief . " He does n't really need a spitter , because he 's got such good stuff . " says Robinson . On the basis of the accused 's retort , it is difficult to determine if he throws any spitters or not . " I did n't even throw two or three spitters last year . " he begins . " I did n't throw one , not one . It 's just that my last ball sinks , so they think it 's a spit ter . I throw fewer spitters than anyone in the league . " Whatever his transgressions , practically every game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which he works with frantic speed to complete the game before one of his teammates blows it . Last season his supporting cast finished seventh in fielding and eighth in batting . " Those guys , " says Sir Walter Burke , a traveling Boston Irishman who is one of many Runyonesque characters Chance has collected around the circuit . " could be standing on Pier Four and all they could catch is a cold . " When Angel infielders successfully field a grounder . Burke goes on , they sometimes are so astonished that by the time they have thrown to first base the runner is safe . " You can hear Chance swearing on Coney Island , " adds Burke . Chance , on the advice of friends , tries to accept his teammates ' errors as graciously as he can . The truth is , however , that he thoroughly enjoys the occasional sparks that his presence in the big leagues creates . " Nuts to the charts , " he says of the laboriously prepared reports that track the strengths and weaknesses of opposing players . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm gon na get beat , there 's one man who 's gon na beat me , " he goes on . thumbing himself emphatically in the chest , " and he 's right here . " Pregame clubhouse meetings , he contends . are largely a waste of time . " Who tells you how to pitch the opposing hitters ? " Chance demands . " Your hitters do . It 's a joke . If 1 do n't know more about pitching than those hitters do , I do n't deserve to pitch . " In the end , says Chance . the ability to win boils down to one quality . " There 's a word for it , and the word is gutsiness . I got gutsiness . " Roy Bates agrees that Chance does . Bates coached him at Northwestern High , a red-brick country schoolhouse in the northwestern part of Wayne County . When Chance first reported for the baseball team , Bates asked him , " What can you throw ? " " I got eight different pitches , " piped Chance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Having no time to wash out the freshman 's mouth with soap . Bates made him tuck in his shirttail. straighten his cap , and run 100 laps around the field . In succeeding years , Batts watched the evolution of Dean Chance with both amusement and awe . The first time the farm boy went on a road trip , a waitress asked him how he wanted his steak prepared . " Medium rare . well done , " he replied . Later , when asked if he cared for dessert , he answered , " No , ma'am , but have another steak if it 's all right . " As a pitcher . Chance began mowing down everybody in sight . He was so invincible that one day , when he gave up two solid hits in a row , Coach Bates rushed to the mound , alarmed at what seemed a collapse . " I put on the wrong shores , " explained Chance . " They 're two sizes too small . " Bates went to work with a knife . giving Chance 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitch a shutout . On at least one occasion Bates arrived late for batting practice and found Chance practicing knockdown pitches on his teammates . " He wanted to throw at anybody , " recalls Bates . " I would n't let him throw at people , but one day a shortstop from Shreve called us a bunch of so-and-so farmers . so I said , ' Dean , next time that guy bats I want him down . ' Dean 's first pitch to the kid was a little high , but his second pitch I 'll never forget as long as I live . That kid sat down so fast that he left his helmet sitting in midair . The ball passed between his helmet and his noggin . He was so scared he committed six errors in the next two innings . " After having accumulated a high-school record of 18 no-hitters , 51 victories and only one defeat , Dean Chance commanded a $30.000 bonus from the Baltimore Orioles and set off on a bus to the Orioles ' Class D farm in Bluefield . W. Va @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent him $3-1 for travel . and the bus ticket had cost only $12 . To his great astonishment , however . Appalachian League hitters , a notch better than Ohio schoolboys . promptly teed off on his most precious home-brewed pitch  --  a creation he had heralded as " my one-pronged fork ball . " Reduced to his last ball , snake ball . and super snake ball . Chance nevertheless won 10 games and lost only three , all the while deporting himself ou trageously , To amuse himself , Chance knocked on a teammate 's door and hurled a bucket of water in the respondent 's face . He paid another teammate to walk through a crowded restaurant clad in nothing but undershorts. i " What makes this story good , " Chance laughs today , " is that here is a ballplayer who signed for $75,000 parading around in his shorts for twenty-five bucks . " ) Moving on to a winter instructional league in Florida , Chance poured a . pitcher of beer on a teammate , was socked in the jaw , shook off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Appleton , Wis. , his next stop , he reported four days late , advising the club 's business manager , " If you want to win a game for a change , pitch me . " While in Appleton he helped win one game hours in advance by luring the opposing pitcher into an all-night poker game . He also married a Wisconsin farm girl , Judy Larson , and after being sold to Los Angeles for $75,000 , proceeded to the Angels ' Dallas-Fort Worth farm club . where he won only nine games and lost 12 during the season . " Who says I had a lousy record ? " Chance demands . " I had twenty-eight saves in relief ! Nine wins and twenty-eight ball games saved ? that 's a phenomenal record . " Stepping into the big leagues in 1962 . Chance immediately achieved notice by falling into the fast company of Bo Belinsky , a city slicker in suede shoes , whose skill with a pool cue and zest for life fascinated the farm boy . " Nobody except my mother has done more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawing a comparison that is intertsling inasmuch as his mother is a country-church Sunday-school teacher . In the trunk of his car he now carried a $50 pool cue , complete with soft-grain leather case . Early in the season Fred Haney picked up the morning newspaper and read that Belinsky had heaved an incompatible lady friend out of his Cadillac at 5:30 A.M. Because tagalong Chance had been at the scene . he  --  like Belinsky  --  was fined $250 , the first cruel blow that filled him with resolve to separate the club from large sums of its money . As it happened . Chance was then on his way to an admirable 14-10 pitching record and the Angels were winning with astonishing frequency , so he braced the front office for a type of benefit that he has since popularized  --  the mid-season raise . He demanded , and got , a boost from $6,000 to 811,000 . " We were in third place . " he says , getting swiftly to the root of Haney'sca pi tulat ion , " and everybody was out of their minds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promptly took back 8500 when Chance arrived late for a spring-training exhibition game . " I 'd pitched seven innings the day before and did n't give up one lousy run , " Chance fumes . " Haney said , ' Next time it 's a thousand . ' All this stuff builds up inside you . You get tired of getting it stuck to you . " Meanwhile , Chance introduced a new twist to intrasquad games , rejecting the time-honored proposition that pitchers are supposed to lob the ball so hitters can unlimber their muscles . It hurt him to see the hitters enjoying themselves . " So I struck out six of ' em in a row , " Chance recalls , delighted by the memory . " Wagner . Thomas . a whole string of them . Oh , Lord , were they moaning . " Fortified by his salary raise and new fame , the ascending Angel had invested $5,000 in a sporting-goods shop , which now folded . He recouped S-1,000 peddling inventory to Los Angeles store 's , each of which demanded he make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of autographs to get rid of all those sweat socks , " sighs the boy pitcher . To make matters worse , he was well on his way to losing 18 games , for the Angels had rediscovered their natural impulse to overrun easy fly balls and stomp grounders . Chance viewed their errors less than kindly . After striking out 12 in one game , he proclaimed . " I had to strike ' em out . I did n't dare let ' em hit the ball to anyone . " Teammates retaliated by filling his locker with garbage and posting a sign above it that read , I 'm NOT NATURALLY STUPID , I 'M JUST PRACTICING . Still . Chance continued to denounce ineptitude wherever he saw it . Demanding a substantial raise for 1964. he called Haney 's attention to the fact that in his 18 defeats the Angels had supplied him with only 28 runs . Nevertheless , Haney refused to raise his $18,000 salary a nickel , arguing that Chance had begun the previous season in poor physical condition , because he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game . " I 'm not going to give you a raise till you prove you 're willing and ready to make baseball your number-one objective , " Haney declared , adding that he would give him a raise in mid-season if his performance merited one . Chance , noting that one can not deposit promises in the bank , signed his contract under protest and immediately mounted a fierce attack on Haney in the newspapers , spicing it with trade rumors that he whispered to sportswriters  --  Chance for Minnesota 's Bob Allison , Chance for San Francisco 's Orlando Cepeda . " Hell , yes , " he says . " I put Haney on the spot . " No sooner had he recorded his second victory than he demanded Haney pay up . Recalling that Haney refused , Chance says , " I told him . ' Then you 'll get 818,000 worth of pitching and no more . ' Around and around we went , and I said , ' I 'm not wasting any more of my valuable time here . ' He just sat there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crazy . " Undaunted , Chance took his case to club president Bob Reynolds . " Dean did n't exactly go over Haney 's head , " wrote Jim Murray in the Los Angeles Times . " He went right through it . " Soon after , Haney caved in , hiking Chance 's pay to $25.000 . By now the intrepid farmer had wrung mid-season raises from management in two years out of three , a pattern that normally might touch oft a run on the front office . The Angels , however , created no such problem for Haney . " For crying out loud , " says Chance , pinpointing the reason , " they were n't doing nothing . " Meanwhile , on a July afternoon Chance proved to himself that he was worth every penny he was getting . Pitching three innings for the American League All-Stars , he shut out the National League on two hits , which was quite a feat because , he says , " I went to bed a quarter past four . " As the season wore on , Chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotel-room brawl in which his roommate , Belinsky , scored a quick knockout over an elderly Los Angeles sportswriter , Braven Dyer . The Angels suspended Belinsky but accepted Chance 's solemn oath that , far from participating in the fisticuffs , he had been in the bathroom showering . " I guess that proves he 's clean-living , " observes Rocky Bridges . Back in Wayne County , meanwhile , a country lawyer named Hank Critchfield measured the full import of the local boy 's success and decided it was time to touch up his public image . Critchlield , a stolid , ruddy-faced man with a shock of iron-gray hair and a small-brimmed fedora that sits atop his head like a loosened bottlecap , is Chance 's longtime friend and counselor . He was chiefly concerned that Wayne County had acquired the wrong impression of its native son , who by now was the father of a two-year-old son and had expressed the intention of becoming a substantial landholder . ( " I 'm gon na own so much land , it 'll be phenomenal , " was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoke and scarcely ever drinks , his much-publicized friendship with night-owl Belinsky had made him seem a bad boy to many in the community . " Around here , " says one Wayne County man . " if you get caught with a case of beer in your icebox , it 's as serious as getting caught crawling in someone 's bedroom window . " Upon Dean 's return home at season 's end , lawyer Critchfield coached him meticulously for a forthcoming speechbefore a Wooster service club . " The only thing I did n't cover , " says Critchfield , " was gambling . So he ends his speech by saying he loses all his money at poker and gin rummy , " Notwithstanding his furious campaign for money and security , Chance grabs his share of restaurant checks , and then some . Actually . Chance 's friends suspect that money itself gives him little more pleasure than the challenge he experiences in foxing it out of someone 's pocket . On the go all winter , he flew one day to Madison , Wis. ? a $69 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lunch . " I got a guy there who 's got nothing but cash , " he said . " He wants to put me on network TV . I should make a hundred G 's out of it . " He would star , he said , in a marionette show , to be called Dian Chance and His Funny Fr ( rut ' In Madison , tossing a few ideas off the top of his head , Madison Avenue style . Chance told the cash man , a metals tycoon named Marion LaMarr Roberts : " We can have a guy showing a puppet how to hit a ball . and then I can say , ' Hey , that 's not the way to hit . I 've got a guy here who can show you . ' And then I 'll bring in Mickey Mantle . Do n't that sound great . Marion ? " The tycoon winced . No money changed hands at lunch , but Chance left Madison richer by one title : executive vice president of the Funny Friends production company . The TV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had come to the big city to say a few words at a Friday luncheon held by a shirt company , buthe stayed the weekend . He treated his hotel-room telephone and TV set as if they were new inventions . For a solid stretch of two hours he phoned friends around the country to say hello . " Haney 's really a gond kid , " he remarked , and promptly phoned Los Angeles to tell Haney hello . The good kid , unfortunately , was not in . Tiring of the phone , Chance watched a 1948 movie , sitting on the edge of a chair no more than 18 inches from the TV . From New York , the Wayne County traveler proceeded to Philadelphia . " I 'm being honored there , " he explained , relishing the sports-page clichE There was no stopping him . He had money , fame and an expense account from any city where he might choose to speak . He was growing tired from travel . and his face was becoming slightly sallow , but Lord , he had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one afternoon shortly before reporting for spring training , the enfant ( err ihIc contemplated his future . " I could be washed up tomorrow , " he said , " and they 'll send me to Siberia . " On the other hand , he could become baseball 's first $100,000 pitcher . " That , " he purred , " is a nice round figure . " The mere thought of $100,000 sent his mind surging back to the day he rode a bus to Bluefield , V. Va. , in the Appalachian League . " Thal was the first time I 'd ever left home alone . " And he was moved to add : " If it 'll help you any , you can write in the story that I was wearing overalls and work shoes . Hell , you got ta make a living too . "
