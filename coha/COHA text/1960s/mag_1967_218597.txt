After scanning the British businessman 's $100 bill , the Geneva bank teller politely excused himself-and called the cops . When the Swiss police later nabbed Thomas G. W. Roe near Lausanne , they happily collected something else : $376,000 in U.S. funny money that was traced to Los Angeles and a British wheeler-dealer named Dennis Loraine . What ensued was a model of transatlantic cooperation . The Swiss sent Roe to California to testify against Loraine , who got six years on counterfeiting charges ; the U.S. then returned Roe , who is now serving his own six-year sentence in a Swiss cell . <P> Behind this recent tale of international crime and punishment was the simple fact that the Geneva teller had just read a counterfeiting advisory put out by the International Criminal Police Organization-Interpol . The glamorous acronym invokes images of SMERSH-smashing undercover men from U.N.C.L.E . but the glamour is a myth . Interpol never makes a pinch ; it is merely the information broker that helps the world 's police to help one another . The catch sounds small ( some 2,000 arrests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Interpol 's prey is the big-time international crook-the jet-borne jewel thief or heroin smuggler who can not be caught unless police spin a global web . <P> A to Z. Interpol started in 1923 , when European police opened an information-swapping center in Vienna . After Hitler grabbed Austria in 1938 , the Gestapo spirited the records to Berlin , where wartime bombing later destroyed them . In 1946 , Interpol was reborn in Paris to combat postwar crime . It got a charter , a general assembly and a **27;5408;TOOLONG Jean Nepote , 52 , a French Sret Nationale commissioner on leave . One-third of Nepote 's 90-odd staffers are French detectives ; most of his $500,000 annual budget is paid in dues by member countries-98 of them , from America to Yugoslavia ( the only Communist country ) to Zambia . The U.S. contribution : $20,000 . <P> Interpol has just formally opened its new eight-story HQ in the fashionable Paris suburb of Saint-Cloud . Equipped with a 50-ft. rooftop antenna , the streamlined building contains a massive communications center linking member countries by radio , Telex and Teletype @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year , are Interpol 's branch offices , called National Central Bureaus . The bureaus are manned by local police whose sole job is trading Interpol information with other bureaus and with Saint-Cloud . One payoff for Americans : interdiction of the narcotics pipeline that runs from Turkish farmers to French labs to New York pushers-pushing the price of an illicit kilo of opium from $500 to as much as $400,000 worth of heroin along the way . " Thanks to marvelous harmony between the world 's police forces , " says Rome-based U.S. Narcotics Agent Michael Picini , " a greater number of seizures is being made overseas today than on the American continent .
