txt President Johnson announced plans today for a comprehensive Government review of the military draft , including the possi- , bility of eliminating it within 10 years ? The present draft law is now more than 15 years old , he pointed out . It was extended last year until 1967 . The President said he was " concerned " that the original principle of equal sharing of military service obligations " may have drifted " in. practice . Mr. Johnson made the announcement at a suddenly called news conference at the White House . He said that he had just " drafted and approved " plans for the study submitted by Secretary of Defense Robert S. . Opening statement , page 70 . The study will be completed in one year , the President said . Broadest of Decade He said it would cover the draft system and related military manpower policies and that it would constitute " the most comprehensive study of the decade of the seventies . " The review will apparently supplant one that has been under way at the Pentagon during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least a partial answer to the growing number of appeals in Congress for studies aimed at revision or repeal of the military conscription law . Members of both parties in the House and Senate have recently called for studies of the draft act , reporting widespread complaints about it from among their constituents . Senator Kenneth B. Keating , Republican of New York , who is one of the most active proponents of a review , repeated in a Senate speech Tuesday his legislative proposal for the formation of a Presidential commission to study the draft . The President 's announced plans fall short of that . Administration officials have indicated they prefer to keep any such studies entirely within the normal channels of government operations . The Army 's recent rejection of Cassius Clay , heavyweight boxing champion , also has brought unfavorable atention to the Selective Service System . The Army said that the boxer had failed the standard pre-1 induction qualification test . Presumably he would have been // rejected even if he had volunteered for military service . However , several members of Congress reported that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt that the champion should have been placed in uniform . President Johnson , at his news conference , said the new review would consider " alternatives to the present draft selection system , including the possibility of meeting our requirements on an entirely voluntary basis in the next decade . " In response to a question , he stressed that he was not predicting the elimination of the draft . " We will have to see the results of the study , " he observed . Question 1.1 The President recalled that he had been " an original proponent " of the draft act . He said that he was " firmly convinced of the soundness of its basic principle , namely that the obligations and e. privilees of service must be shared equally in accordance with a fair and just system . " But he said there were " recent indications that in application the system may have drifted from this concept . " While he said it was clear that the draft was needed at present for meeting military requirements , he observed also that the law had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States never had a peacetime draft law until 1940 . The following year , partly as a result of parliamentary activity by Mr. Johnson , who was then a young Representative from Texas , the peacetime draft was extended in the House by one vote . After the war , conscription and proposals for universal military training were the subjects of furious debate . The draft was dropped briefly but reinstituted when military manpower requirements could not be met . The present Universal Military Training and Service Act , passed in 1951 , has been extended regularly by Congress every four years with diminishing debate . In the meantime , however , criticism of the draft laws has grown . President Kennedy , in a letter to James G. Patton , president of the National Farmers Union , conceded last year : " I am sure that all of us agree that the selective service act is administered as fairly as it can be but falls far short of being perfect . Certainly there are inequities in its results . " President Kennedy called attention at the time to inequities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of eligible manpower is far in excess of the needs of the armed services , short of a national emergency . " About nine million men of draft age , between 18 and 26 , are in the " pool , " but only about half of them are ever likely to see service , because of deferments and other factors . To maintain the armed forces at about 2.7 million men , the Pentagon needs only about 500,000 new recruits annually . Many of the recruits , under stimulus of the draft , are volunteers . Draft calls this year have ranged between 16,000 in January and 12,000 in May . In recent years , only the Army has depended upon the draft to meet its recruitment needs . Various alternatives to the draft have been suggested . These include pay increases  --  to make military service more attractive  --  and a nationwide lottery under which various deferment and exemption practices would be eliminated and the luck of the draw substituted . The law sets a basic military obligation of six years of combined active and reserve military status . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for those who do not volunteer for one of the various service programs and are not otherwise deferred .
