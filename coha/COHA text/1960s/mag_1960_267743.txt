Is pornography a mounting menace to U.S. youth ? Church bodies and guardian groups , including the Roman Catholic National Organization for Decent Literature , the Protestant Churchmen 's Committee for Decent Publications , and others , cite alarming statistics and urge various actions ranging from newsstand boycotts to congressional legislation . In last week 's Christian Century , the managing director of the American Book Publishers Council , Unitarian Dan Lacy , presents a cool and collected analysis of a situation that normally collects more heat than light . <P> Author Lacy sees little reason to believe that there has been much relative growth in " hard-core , " out-and-out pornography ( sold under the counter ) , and is skeptical of some of the statistics bandied about semipornographic publications ( sold openly ) . If the often-mentioned $1 billion figure were accurate , says Lacy , " every family in America would be spending on the average about $20 a year on pornography . " Psychiatrists , sociologists and experts on juvenile delinquency disagree , too , on the effects of pornography on the young- " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materials that can divert into fantasy certain drives that might otherwise be expressed in anti-social acts . " <P> Any group is within its rights to protest against a book , magazine or film , says Lacy , provided it limits itself to protesting and does not attempt coercion without due process of law , such as by boycott or the circulation of a blacklist under the " color of authority " provided by an attorney general or police official . Such extralegal activities inevitably open the door for doctrinal and political pressures : " The Legion of Decency warns against a film like Bette Davis ' Storm Center because its heroine is a librarian who refuses to remove a Communist book from the shelves . Films like The Miracle or Martin Luther are banned or attacked for reasons that seem purely doctrinal . " <P> More important than this danger of doctrinal coercion is the fact , according to Lacy , that most of the reform groups warn against pornography but do little or nothing to bring about good reading . Whatever corrupts youth , " it is not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Vladimir Nabokov or , for that matter , Grace Metalious . " In fact , it is the youngsters ' very " inability to do sustained reading , frustrating the youth at school and cutting off a major avenue of escape from the limits of what is usually a mean and sordid environment , that tends to breed rebellious delinquency . " Concludes Lacy : " Life itself is often shocking , beset with temptation , surrounded with sordidness . . . Frightened ignorance is no good preparation " to meet these . But a youngster who has been prepared for these shocks with honesty will have " little to fear from his encounter with the pages of any book . "
