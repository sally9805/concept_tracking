A Corner of a Foreign Jail A Story by ALEXIS LADAS Drawings by Abram Rudisill 0 U R attempt to escape from jail on the occupied Greek island of Samos shattered the composure of our Italian overlords . It was unheard of in their experience for prisoners thus to take their lives into their own hands for the absurd privilege of risking them again in the perilous business of war . " Why should you want to run away ? " the sergeant of the guard  --  the one we called the Dog " ? asked us in pained but genuine surprise . " Are you not fed and lodged and out of danger here ? " That it was even a temporary soldier 's duty to escape seemed to him much too far-fetched a concept of military virtue . As for the fact that we 'd been captured in civilian clothes behind the enemy lines and therefore stood a damned good chance of being tried for espionage and shot , he felt that that was something which should properly be left to the court-martial and to God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course of fate , and smacked of sacrilege . The three of us by no means shared his view . Till then the year  --  black 1942 ? had piled disaster on defeat ; the only hope for us was through our own exertions . We had tried to break outtwice before and we proposed to keep on trying , though I must admit that Elia and I felt that our latest attempt entitled us to a period of rest and recuperation . Not so Frank . On the very night of our recapture , when we were flung battered and bloody into the isolation cell with trigger-happy sentries pointing rifles at us from every direction , he had begun examining the prospects of starting a tunnel under the floor boards . I do n't know whether it was because he was an Englishman , cast by the chance of war among the lesser breeds , or because he was a Captain and a boxing Blue , or simply because he enjoyed it , but to Elia and me , as reasonable Greeks , his mania for escaping seemed to exceed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we secretly hoped that our Italian keepers would maintain their vigilance so that we could in all conscience take it easy for a bit . On this occasion our unworthy wishes were fulfilled , and with a vengeance . We were kept in isolation for a month in the notorious " cell of rigors . " Then we were locked up in the wash house with an armed sentry at the door . Our food ration was cut down to a minimum , and we were forbidden to exercise . To turn them against us , the other prisoners  --  petty thieves , black marketeers , and such , to whom escapes were schoolboy nonsense  --  were made to suffer too . Their bunks were confiscated ; they were locked up in their cells for a whole week so that they could not use the lavatories ; people from outside 60 A CORNER OF A FOREIGN JAIL were not allowed to visit them or send them food or cigarettes . The normally busy and cheerful atmosphere of a provincial jail was utterly destroyed , and we were most unpopular . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was " the Dog , " the prison Commandant . He was a brute and a martinet , a regular police sergeant with nineteen years of service and one more to go . Our attempted escape had nearly cost him both his pension and his stripes . He had no love for us at all , nor we for him after the beatings he and his boys had given us . The strange thing , though , was the ambivalence of his feeling toward Frank , a mixture of dislike and unavowed respect . I do n't suppose he liked Elia and me any better , but we , being Greeks and therefore members of a conquered nation , at least did not give him an inferiority complex . Frank , on the other hand , was the only real live Englishman on the island . To the Dog , having custody of Frank must have seemed much like being given responsibility for a lion in a flimsy cage ; the beast was dangerous , but it was also valuable and  --  even to a policeman  --  manifestly noble and impressive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those mixed feelings of subservience and envy toward the visiting " Milord Inglese , " dating back , doubtless , to the time of the Grand Tours . Add to this that the captive was an officer and the master a sergeant ; that Fascist Italy was determined to seem civilized and at the same time manly and inflexible ; and finally that Frank was personally handsome , blue-eyed , and " molto simpatico , " and the Commandant 's schizophrenic attitude is easily explained . He loved to lord it over Frank , but he could hardly keep from standing at attention when addressing him . What was more , he seemed to attribute to him almost supernatural powers . I do n't think the Dog got much sleep during the months that followed . As long as we were kept in the ramshackle old jail , he lived in constant fear that Frank would vanish . None of the elaborate safety measures he had taken satisfied him ; even our metal spoons had been Alexis Ladas is Overseas Director of Encyclopaedia Britannic:a Films , and lives in New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was recruited by a British intelligence outfit in Egypt , returned to Greece in disguise , was captured and condemned to death , but escaped and eventually became a naval commando . This is his fourth narrative in " Harper's. " replaced by wooden ones . Yet every clay the Commandant personally inspected every corner of our cell to reassure himself that we had not begun a tunnel . Frequently in the middle of the night he would come galloping across the moonlit courtyard dressed only in his boots and long --  johns , with a pistol in one hand and a flashlight in the other , just to make sure we were still there . I T WAS on one of his nighttime visits  --  pro- yoked on that particular occasion by the noise we 'd made in killing one of the multitude of rats which infested our cell  --  that he told us about the " salottino . " " Do n't worry , " he said . " You wo n't have to put up with the rats much longer . In the new prison which we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you . It will be clean and airy , and there will be no rats . A real little sitting-room . " It was the first time we had heard that we were going to be moved and there were a thousand questions we wanted to ask , but he would say no more that night . However , from then on until we were transferred some three months later , not a day passed without his making reference to the new salottino specially built for the English captain and his entourage . Then one day , about a month before we were transferred , the sergeant came and told Frank that , knowing the fetish which the British made of exercise , lie had decided to permit us the freedom of the courtyard for half an hour every afternoon after the other prisoners had been locked up . Such magnanimity was unbelievable , particularly when we found that only the normal sentries on the walk were present and that the main gate of the prison was left open . We feared the situation would be too much for Frank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain he would consider himself honor bound to make a dash for what he hoped was freedom , and what we felt sure was the lime pit . To us the scheme of the Italians seemed childishly transparent . There was the open door , the sleepy sentries , the oncoming dusk . This was the bait . But beyond the gate we knew there was an open square without a shred of cover for a hundred yards . There also were two permanent guards outside the door and a six-man mobile patrol with a machine gun . We knew that nothing would give the Dog such pleasure as to see Frank attempt the fateful sprint . Without a word being said , Elia and I took turns blocking Frank unobtrusively every time A STORY BY ALEXIS LADAS GI we trotted past the open gate , either by getting in his way or by distracting his attention . For my part , I was determined to bring him to the ground if he so much as started for the door , even if it cost me his friendship . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but we at least consoled ourselves with the thought that it might be more feasible to break out of the famous salottino . We learned from other sources that the new prison was a converted warehouse , and though we had not taken the Sergeant 's description of the salottino at its face value , we were completely unprepared for what confronted us the day we were transferred . The salottino was a concrete box hardly long enough to lie down in . It hail been built under the stone staircase leading to the second floor so that its outer wall was six feet thick . High up near the ceiling was what might he euphemistically called a window ; it was , in fact , a tunnel with bars at each end , through which , if one stood on tiptoe , one could see , beyond the barbed-wire fence , part of the balcony of a house with a geranium in a pot . The Sergeant personally escorted us down into our special little dungeon . " Is n't it pretty , " he said as he unlocked our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ; a perfect salottino . And no rats . Except for three big ones that I know . " He winked and patted Frank on the back . " But not even a rat could get nut of here , " he added with a nasty laugh . " I hope your Highness will enjoy his stay . It will be a long one unless the court-martial decides to have you shot soon . " We were too angry and disheartened to say anything at the time but later , when the three of us were sitting on the cold concrete floor nursing our grievance , Frank spoke for all of us when he remarked in that icy English voice of his , " If it 's the last thing I do I 'm going to make that bastard regret his little joke . " T HOSE were gloomy clays . Not all days in prison are such . As in the other life , there are cheerful days too ; days when a postcard has arrived from home , or the food has been better , or a rat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the girl in the house opposite watering the geranium . But our move to the salottino had coincided with the approach of winter , and winter on the sunny isle of Samos is something altogether disheartening . That year it poured almost without a break for three whole months . The rattling of the rain on the tin sheet overthe door above our cell nearly drove us mad . Even the normally cheerful Italian guards took to singing dirges . The parade ground  --  that narrow strip of earth between the building and the barbed-wire fence ? was turned into a sea of mud . Hunting for cigarette butts  --  our main interest during our exercise outings  --  became quite useless . Indeed , it was a pleasure to return to our " sitting-room , " to squat in our respective corners and teach each other songs or bits of poetry . It was amusing to listen to Elia reciting , ' ' Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow . " He always had trouble pronouncing " syllable , " which struck Frank as particularly funny since  --  the word being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the whole quotation . Frank reciting like a parrot the ancient epitaph to the three hundred Spartans fallen at Thermopylae seemed no less funny to Elia and me . And the three of us together singing " Carry me back to old Virginny " would have sounded quite absurd to anyone else . But our bellowing at least helped to deaden the mournful drumming of the rain .... And yet it was the rain which gave us the first glimmering for a plan of escape . Not long after our arrival in the new prison , we were informed that a girl working for the Bishop 's charities had obtained permission from the Governor to visit us in her capacity as a welfare worker . Her name turned out to be Danae , but she was very plain . Nevertheless she was the first woman I had spoken to for many a month and I was shocked to find myself all of a flutter . Worse still , / found that I was even more than usually susceptible to the dramatic overtones of the encounter : the rain , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then the girl in black  --  already full of mystery in my imagination  --  speaking to the doomed but still unconquered prisoner behind the barbed-wire fence . Such were the adolescent trappings with which my mind endowed our meeting as I watched the demure , ugly girl with her black kerchief and her downcast eyes , being escorted across the line where it was death to step at other times . But I had little doubt that all the mystery would vanish when she spoke , that she would prove to be just what she looked : the uninspired daughter of the parish priest or of the local pharmacist bringing a basket of food to the prison out of compassion perhaps , but mainly because she had been told to do so . Then she did speak and instantly my romantic imaginings were clothed in real and poignant substance . The eyes Danae raised to mine burned with the fierce light of dedication , 62 A CORNER OF A FOREIGN JAIL and her voice assured me that she was prepared to back her faith with action . I felt no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guards ' attention strayed . " The Bishop is in touch with people on the other side who are interested in your welfare . They also said to tell you your mission was not a failure . They got the information . " She had no opportunity to say more , but it was some consolation to know that prison and quite possibly the firing squad would not have been for nothing . Furthermore , even the most tenuous contact with our own Intelligence people in neutral Turkey not ten miles away was very good for our morale , though at that time we could n't see how it would help us . An aged cleric and a girl , no matter how devoted , would hardly make the best accomplices for us in a hit-and-run prison break . From then on , once a week , I was given a few minutes with Danae , who always came with a basket of food , and always wore the same spotless black dress and kerchief . As I came to know her better I realized that I was in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truly selfless person  --  or more accurately , a person whose only real satisfaction could he in self-sacrifice . Her ugliness , her passion for the Russian writers , her total Jack of worldly knowledge , joined the exalted mood of war to give her abnegation an unreal and at times alarming twist . I had the uneasy feeling that if no opportunity for heroism existed , it would have to be created to justify her expectations . What was particularly embarrassing was finding oneself cast in the role of hero When all one really wanted was to get out of that stinking jail . I tried to keep the conversations at our brief meetings to essentials , and away from emotional acrobatics , but our communications on escape plans were rare and fragmentary , as a Greek-speaking guard was always present . To exchange written messages was almost impossible . The food she passed in through the barbed wire was thoroughly inspected . The bread was cut up into little pieces ; the soup was poured from one container to another ; even the nuts were broken open . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lethal weapon past the guard . Itwas equally clear that she would not have hesitated to risk her life trying . For days we mulled over the problem of how Danae could help us to escape . A thousand possibilities were studied and discarded . And then , quite unexpectedly , the rain beating on the tin roof above our window reminded me of the mud on the parade ground and of the trouble it gave Frank who always wanted to be neatly turned out , of the time he spent removing the mud stains from his trousers and his shoes , and of how he washed his shirt every night and slept on his trousers so they would have a crease . " Frank , " I said , " the trouble with our thinking is that we are trying to smuggle something past the guards . Why not have them give it to us ? " Frank gaped at me . " How the devil do you think we can make them give us a file or a hacksaw blade ? " he asked . " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might . get them to offer us a pair of shoes , though . Supposing tomorrow you went out to the yard without your shoes on and said that you had worn them out or something . What would they do ? " " They 'd send me back into the cell . Anyway , they 'd search and find that my shoes were all right . " " I bet they 'd dig up another pair for you , " I said . " Besides I mean that you should really do away with your old ones . " " Like hell , " said Frank , " what if they never give me another pair ? I have no intention of spending the rest of the war in my bare feet . It 's against the rule for British officers to go about without their shoes on even in Africa . Anyway , why me ? Why not one of you chaps ? " " Because I 'm sure it would embarrass them much more to have an English Captain rather than an ordinary Greek walking about barefooted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Red Cross might even hear about it and the Italians would n't like that at all . They 're supposed to be civilized . " " Bahl What can the Red Cross do for poor bloody bastards captured in civilian clothes ? " Frank remarked impatiently , but it was clear that he conceded some merit to my argument . In fact , try as he might , he could not hide his rising excitement . " What I do n't gather , " he insisted with deliberate obtuseness , " is what this rigmarole will get us . At best I will exchange one pair of shoes for another . " " My hope is that they wo n't have any shoes themselves and that they will apply to the Bishop 's charities , " I answered . " Danae could have a hacksaw blade sewn inside each sole . The Italians could never tell the difference by the weight . They 'd have to tear the things apart , and that 's exactly what I trust they will not do since it is they who will be giving us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frank grudgingly . " I kite to part with these old things . But I suppose it 's worth a try . " So we ripped the sole completely off Frank 's left shoe , and worked the right one back and forth until the upper tore in half . When we had clone with them , the shoes were past repair . The following day Frank went out to the parade ground wearing no shoes . He was as usual freshly shaven and from the ankles up looked almost absurdly smart and handsome in his creased trousers and his clean shirt with the collar turned up . As was our habit , we started pacing sedately up and down the muddy promenade , pretending to be engrossed in conversation , " You know , " Frank said , " this is n't half unpleasant . I have n't walked barefooted through the mud since I was a child . The feeling of the stuff oozing between your toes is quite agreeable , but pretty soon it 's going to be beastly cold . " It took some time for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw the sentry on the watchtower by the gate trying by an elaborate pantomime to convey the news of Frank 's bare feet to the sentry across the yard . Then one by one the others became aware that the English captain was walking barefooted in the mud . There were stares and nervous giggles and furtive whisperings behind our backs , but whenever we looked straight at any man , he would pretend he was engrossed in something else , or walk off whistling with his hands in his pockets . When Danae came for her weekly visit , the guard who was escorting me to the barbed-wire cage asked me , after a good deal of hemming and hawing , why the Captain had taken off his shoes . " It 's not a question of having taken them off , but of having none to put on , " I replied snootily . Danae noticed Frank 's naked feet almost the very minute she was let into the cage . Distance and barbed wire notwithstanding , she had fallen head over heels in love with rather withthe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had first seen him pacing up and down the yard . Now she clapped her hand over her mouth and the tears started rolling down her sallow cheeks . " The poor boy . The poor boy , " she kept repeating through her fingers . Her distress upset the guard and he turned away discreetly . I took the opportunity to whisper to Dame , " It 's all a trick , but for God 's sake keep on crying . " I even had a chance to explain briefly what we expected of her . When the guard searched me for contraband before letting me out of the cage he mumbled in my ear , " It is n't right for the Captain to walk about barefooted . " " Ca n't he helped , " I replied curtly . " Vae victis  --  as you people say . " " It is n't proper , " he insisted . " Well what do you expect me to do ? " I snapped , " give him my own ? I 'm not his keeper . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go without shoes . " T H E next clay the Dog himself tried to browbeat me , but it was clear that his tantrum stemmed mostly from embarrassment . It was unheard of for an officer to walk about in public barefooted , he bellowed . It was bad for discipline . I told him that that was his problem . " Is n't the Captain ashamed to disgrace his country and his rank by his behavior ? " the Commandant shouted . I braced myself to receive a slap in the face and told him that I thought the shame was not on Frank but on those whose prisoner he was . " Civilized countries , " I added , " do not let their prisoners go without shoes . Or is not Italy a signatory of the Geneva Con-vention ? " The Sergeant went purple in the face , but all he did was clench his fists and sputter . He was so taken aback he did n't even think to tell me that the Geneva Convention did not cover people charged with espionage . " I run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shouted . " Or do you think I ought to buy a pair out of my pay ? " " Oh , that ? " I said offhandedly . " Of course , one does n't expect the army to give its boots to prisoners . But does n't the Church or the Red Cross usually deal with such matters ? " He said no more but I was almost sure that I had planted the seed . A few days later when Danae brought our food , we saw the Sergeant talking to her . When I was taken to see her , she was all smiles . " It 's worked , " she whispered . " The Sergeant asked me for a pair of shoes from the charities , 64 A CORNER OF A FOREIGN JAIL He said I was to keep it secret . He said it was to came as a surprise . It will take a week to have the shoes made He said I was to try and have them by Christmas Day . I have the blades . I will give them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Those seven days were torture for the Italians . They were going through agonies of pretense to keep the thing a secret from us . ' As the days passed , we started worrying that they would never make it . They did n't even trust each other to talk to us alone . Every time one of them approached us , a couple of others would come up to make quite sure that he would n't give anything away . The funniest thing of all was their determined effort to ignore Frank 's muddy feet , which seemed to exert upon them an irresistible fascination . They did not dare so much as look down at the ground , with the result that they all went about with their noses in the air like so many chickens drinking . In the end the strain began to tell even on us . At last the great day came . No sooner had Danae appeared than all the guards rushed out to meet her , even forgetting to lock the door behind them . The Sergeant practically grabbed the shoes out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back toward Frank , followed by a procession of broadly grinning soldiers . A few paces away they stopped and the Dog advanced alone to hand the shoes to Frank with a hesitant little old-world bow . " A Christmas present for the Captain , " he said . My heart was beating fit to burst as Frank turned the precious , shiny things over and over in his hands as if he did n't know what to do with them . In fact they were not shoes at all but patent-leather , elastic-sided boots such as clerics wear . Obviously they had first been intended for the Bishop himself . They were the absurdest , most beautiful pail- of hoots we had ever seen . Frank tried to look surprised as if he did n't understand what it was all about , but he was really quite moved and only managed to look sheepish . To my amazement , he seemed for a moment as if he were going to burst into tears . Then brusquely. to cover up his embarrassment , he stuck his hand straight out in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glanced inquiringly behind him at his compatriots . Encouraged by the grinning faces , he grabbed Frank 's hand and shook it . Then all the others wanted to shake Frank 's hand , and then , as an afterthought , Elia 's and mine , so as not to hurt our feelings . Frank was taken into the cell to dry his feet , and reappeared wearing the Bishop'snew boats . The back-slapping and cheering and good will made the three of us feel very guilty . Frank in particular appeared to be in a state of great inner turmoil . Suddenly he drew himself up at attention , blushing furiously , and shouted at me as if he were back in the orderly room . " Ask the Sergeant , " he snapped , " if I may be permitted to thank the girl who brought the boots . " My heart sank at the thought of thus pointedly reminding the Italians that the boots had come from a Greek source , but to protest at that point would have been even more dangerous . Besides , I realised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dog for such a favor and could not bring myself to make things even more difficult . But the Sergeant , in his expansive mood thought nothing of it . " But of course , of course , " he said , winking knowingly when I had translated the request . " The Captain has not spoken to a signorina for a long time . " He led Frank to where Danae was still standing outside the wire , watching the excitement . Frank stuck his arm through the barbed wire and shook Danae 's hand . " Thank you very much , " he said . The poor girl went very pale ; her lips started twitching , but she could n't utter a word . Then she looked down at Frank 's feet and began to cry quietly . She seemed much more moved at the thought that Frank was wearing shoes again than at the fact that we had pulled a beauty of a coup . T H A T night in the cell we were going over the escape plan once more . As was our custom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken , so as to give Frank a chance to spot the weak points . Later I would do the same in Greek for Elia 's benefit . " We wait for a rainy Saturday night , " I was saying . " After supper , when they 've had their double wine ration , they start singing upstairs . At about 9:30 , when they 're well warmed up and the sentries outside have been on duty for three and a half hours and are getting tired and careless , we cut the inside bars . " " How long will it take ? " asked Frank . " Eight minutes more or less . A minute for each bar , " I replied . " You have n't taken into account that the blade will be getting more and more blunt . " " Oh yes I have , " I replied , unable to prevent a certain note of self-satisfaction from creeping into my voice . After all , this was my baby , and I was n't going to endanger it by some stupid sentries , about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the rain I do n't think there is much chance they 'll either see or hear him ; the light over the sentry boxes does n't carry that far in the rain , and he 'll cut the wire through a blanket to minimize the noise . " " I suppose he can run for it if they challenge him , " Frank remarked . " Anyway , " I continued , " while he 's cutting the wire we 'll be sawing through the outside bars . Using both blades , it should n't take more than fifteen minutes if there are no interruptions . That will bring us to just a few minutes before the changing of the guard .

" Frank , I hate to say this , but you know what will happen to us if we do n't get out of here soon . I just do n't like the idea of being stood up against a wall and shot full of holes . I 've got a thing about it . You may not mind , but you should also think of Elia and me . " " All right , you two can go without . me . I never said you should n't , " he retorted , sounding more than ever like a stubborn little boy . " Do n't be idiotic , " I said , feeling moved and exasperated at the same time . I hated missing such an opportunity to escape , but to go without Frank was unthinkable . " You 've hardly even exchanged a word with the girl , " I said . " For all you know , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself for you . " " Sorry old man , " Frank repeated sadly . " I just ca n't do it . But do n't you worry . There 'll be other chances . " I knew that it was no good pressing him any more and I was heartbroken . Half an hour before , freedom had seemed within our grasp ; now the gray days stretched again before us with the specter of a bare and bloody wall standing at the end .

" Then he returned to memorizing the label on an empty bottle of Italian brilliantine which he had found in the courtyard that afternoon . Harper 's Magazine , April 1961
