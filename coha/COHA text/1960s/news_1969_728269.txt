Henry Ford 2d , chairman of the Ford Motor Company , committed his company today to " an intensified effort to minimize pollution " from its products and plants " in the shortest possible time . " Speaking at a news conference at Ford 's headquarters in Dearborn , Mr. Ford called environmental pollution " by far the most important problem " facing his company and the entire automobile industry in the next 10 years . " I can not emphasize too strongly my own personal ' oncern and that of Ford Motor Company with removing automobile-related pollutants as a threat to the environmental quality , " Mr. Ford said . " This concern will be reflected not only in words but in specific , concrete actions based upon all the scientific , engineering and manufacturing skills at our command . " We are making this commitment because of our recognition that the quality of the environment warrants extraordinary effort on the part of all who may be in a position to improve our physical surroundings . " To back up his company 's commitment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to feed hundreds of experimental , low-emission automobiles into auto fleets for testing . lThe development of an experimental clean air package // that could be used on older cars now on the road . clExperiments at one factory to develop a method of testing each automobile for pollution control as it rolls down the assembly line . 91Development of a " little white box " to help garagemen diagnose pollution problems in cars . Mr. Ford said his company would spend $31-million on vehicle pollution control next year and $60-million in the next two years on cutting air and water pollution at Ford plants . In the last 10 years , he said , Ford spent $6-million to curb pollution at its plants . " We are able to make this commitment at this time , " he said , " because years of research , development and testing have now brought us to the point where we can foresee , in the near future , the practical achievement of levels of pollution control that seemed out of reach until recently . " Mr. Ford 's remarks represented the strongest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although the General Motors Corporation , the largest auto manufacturer , and other auto makers are also spending heavily to develop pollution control equipment . A Major Share The executive warned that pollution control would be costly and that the car buyer would pay " at least a major part . " He said : " everybody 's going to have to pay for the environmental problem . " The major automobile pollutants are unburned gasoline or hydrocarbons ; carbon monoxide and oxides of nitrogen . At the news conference , two experimental projects were shown : One was a car with a series of muffler-like devices using catalysts and air pumps to remove exhaust pollutants ; the other was an engine equipped with reactors to burn off fumes . Both systems were said to cut more than 90 per cent of the major auto exhaust pollutants . While more work appears to be needed on both systems , Donald Jensen , Ford 's top pollution expert , said he expected to see some of the equipment on cars by 1974 or 1975 . The experimental car and engine would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent and nitrogen oxides 90 per cent from precontrol levels , Mr. Jensen said . Among the specific programs detailed , Mr. Ford said that , by the end of 1971 , his company would be offering to sell cars with the experimental pollution control systems to private fleets , and would lend vehicles to pollution control authorities in California and - Washington , D. C. , for testing . Several hundred cars would be involved , he said . He also noted the company 's efforts to curb water and air pollution at its plants . At a new Kentucky truck plant near Louisville , he said , Ford is cooperating with local government in establishing " the nucleus of a waste water treatment plant that will provide collection and treatment facilities not only for our own plant but for all other users at a wide geographical area . " Although there is " no such thing as a completely clean motor vehicle or industrial plant , " Mr. Ford said , " we will achieve products and manufacturing facilities that do not significantly contaminate our atmosphere , waters or landscape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was devoted to the pollution problem , he also announced that Ford was cutting back on its automobile racing program ; that a new Volkswagen-size ' car was being readied for production in the United States , and that a massive housing-office building project in Dearborn , costing hundreds of millions of dollars , would be started next year .
