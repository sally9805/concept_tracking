Trade Center . An announcement of the settlement is expected shortly , perhaps today . The details were worked out by Deputy Mayor Robert Price and Austin J. Tobin , executive director of the authority . A source close to the long and delicate negotiations over the 6525-million project confirmed yesterday that agreement was " within immediate reach , " but he declined to discuss the details . The principal point of argument has been how much money the Port Authority will pay the city in lieu of taxes for the 16-acre Trade Center site on the Lower West Side of Manhattan . The authority is reported to have offered an annual payment // of $4-million , while the city has demanded payments that the administration says total $18-million and the authority insists would cost it close to $30-million a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up issuance of building permits and street closings that the authority needs to begin construction . If the two sides settle their differences as expected , the agreement will remove . . the last major block to the project . The Port Authority 's proposal is to build a complex that would inI corporate twin 110-story skyscrapers on a superblock that would be bounded by the West Side Highway and Barclay , Church and Liberty Streets . Although the discussions have centered on the question of payment in lieu of taxes ? the authority , as a bi-state agency , pays no real-estate taxes ? the city has also sought to revise some of its existing agreements with the authority and write some new ones . City Hall has tried , for example , to persuade the authority to renegotiate leases on the airports , and to agree to build major new facilities on the New York side of the port . $100-Million Ship Terminal Among the latter proposals the city has urged the agency to build a $100-million passenger ship terminal on the West Side . Last spring the authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ source said the authority would agree to press ahead with plans for the project as part of the agreement on the World Trade Center . Although the news of the imminent agreement was widely discussed around City Hall yesterday , both parties in the negotiations were guarded in their public statements . Deputy Mayor Price , who has been chairman of a special committee appointed by the Mayor c-nduc  --  : : ctielons. confined himself to a two-sentence statement : " Discussions with the Port Authority on the World Trade Center and related matters are under way . We are hopeful that a satisfactory agreement will be reached shortly . " The Port Authority was even more succinct . A spokesman said : " Discussions are under way and we are hopeful that an accord will be reached shortly : , The negotiations began early in March , when the Lindsay administration seized on the Trade Center as an opportunity to review its entire relationship with the Port Authority . The talks proceeded uneventfully enough until May 29 when the Price committee submitted to Mr. Tobin , the authority 's director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would require for the issuance of building permits . Besides annual payments , the conditions included new , projects that the authority said would require a capital outlay of $242. million . All told , the agency contended , the city 's proposals would cost it more than $3-billion during a 99-year lease Mr. Tobin denounced the conditions as " preposterous " and angrily broke off the negotiations . Mayor Lindsay 's personal intervention was required to get the talks going again and they I proceeded for several weeks until they stalled a second time over a relatively minor point . The authority demanded that the city give it permission to go ahead with a preliminary step in the construction , and the city declined to issue the permits . The deadlock lasted until 1C days ago , when Mr. Price and Mr .. Tobin resumed the discussions . In the early stages of the talks the members of the Mayor 's negotiating committee  --  his Corporation Counsel and six of his commissioners and assistants ? participated fully . When the sessions resumed 10 days ago . Mr. Price and J. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the city . Estimates Vary Mr. Price assembled the committee last night at City Hall to outline the details of the arrangement to the other members . Speculation over how much the city would receive from the authority in annual payments for the Trade Center site varied from $7-million to $15-million . One committee member , who predicted two months ago that the compromise figure would be $14-million , said late yesterday that he expected it would be closer to $8-million . The City Council , which held a public hearing on the Trade Center two months ago , urged the administration at the time not to accept less than $25-million . One close observer of the negotiations said that the annual payment to the city would be based on a share of the revenue brought in by the Trade Center . This proposal was said to have been drawn up by Mr. Ranizin , but neither he nor any of the other participants would comment on the report .

In January , 1964 , Governor Rockefeller announced his intention to centralize the state 's New York City offices in the Trade Center , thereby making the state the project 's biggest prospective tenant .
