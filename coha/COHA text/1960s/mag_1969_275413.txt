Last week , just 16 hours after he retired as chief of the Los Angeles police department , Tom Reddin ran a Norelco over his afternoon stubble , popped in his contact lenses , tucked a microphone into the front of his gold shirt and took over as evening news anchorman of station KTLA-TV . <P> He asked the audience to " bear with me while I falter and stumble at times , " then talked his way into the lead item . Like most of the rest of the 60-minute program , it was about his arrival at KTLA . He ran footage of tributes from HEW Secretary Robert Finch , Senator George Murphy ( " Tom is the only real threat to John Wayne " ) and Mayor Sam Yorty ( " We did n't want to lose him " ) He traded compliments with KTLA Sportscaster Tom Harmon . <P> Finally , he worked his way into an awkward five-minute overview of the world that he had been writing for three days . It positioned him somewhat to the right of his reputation as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attitude maintained by the station 's majority stockholder , Gene Autry . Reddin 's prime target was the dissidents : " I am fed up with the militant , regardless of color or political persuasion , who is constantly on the attack . The promoters of urban guerrilla warfare are as much the enemy of our society as the soldier on a foreign battlefield . " <P> Electronic Addiction . At the end of the premiere , Station Manager Doug Finley found Rookie Reddin " so good " that he cried ( " Well , maybe not cried , but I certainly lumped up " ) . Reddin was more straight-shooting . Before the show he had quipped : " I believe each man should start at the top of his chosen profession . " Afterwards he said , " You know , it 's not as easy as it looks . " Despite two weeks of video-taped dry runs , he did not transmit the Cronkite-like " casualness " that he had promised . His normally easy Irish smile switched on when it should have been turned off , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the Liberty Bell . <P> But on opening night at least , KTLA got what it was paying $100,000 a year for : a fourfold increase in the ratings . In a town addicted to electronic news ( the supper-hour local report runs two hours on one station ) , KTLA had fallen into fifth place after a rival station wooed away its top announcer , George Putnam , an archconservative who never fails to put America first . The salary that won George was $300,000 ( Walter Cronkite earns something over $200,000 ) . Even if Reddin does not improve over his shaky shakedown , he has an escalator contract guaranteeing him $150,000 a year within five years .
