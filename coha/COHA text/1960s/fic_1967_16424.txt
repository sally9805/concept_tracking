13 . EXT . THE ORCHARD AND COTTAGE . DAY . Winter . The branches are bare . A few apples rot at the foot of the trees . A trail of smoke comes from the chimney . We hear the sound of a pony and trap coming nearer and now PAN off to the lane . A trap with a GENTLEMAN , in fact a solicitor , being driven in , comes slowly along and stops as the GENTLEMAN indicates to the DRIVER that this is the place . The GENTLEMAN checks his papers and then descends - town shoes onto the rough , slightly muddy ground . He slithers and then goes up the path towards the cottage . BATHSHEBA 's face is visible at a window . MRS . HURST opens the door as the GENTLEMAN reaches it . &nbsp; GENTLEMANMiss Bathsheba Everdene ? 14 . EXT . THE DOWNS . DAY . A bitter afternoon .

Her carpetbag beside her proves that she is leaving the district . The trap swings past us and we see that BATHSHEBA , her back to the GENTLEMAN , is gazing at her face in a hand looking-glass .

DICK crawls out from under the hut and shakes himself and growls to get REX to come out , but REX does n't . DICK goes racing off into the white mist which veils the edge of the field .

CUT ahead to the CORPORAL and SOLDIER sitting on the box of the ammunition cart .

GABRIEL with REX in the centre of the town , where the great annual assembly of LABOURERS is waiting to be hired . GABRIEL has an air about him , although he is stern-faced and thinner , which leads the LABOURERS to regard him with respect . &nbsp; LABOURERYou looking for hands , sir ? &nbsp; GABRIEL ( with a thin smile ) No , I 'm looking for a place myself - know anyone who needs a bailiff ? &nbsp; LABOURERNo , that I do n't . GABRIEL pushes on to where a crowd of MEN are waiting . CARTERS and WAGGONERS with pieces of whipcord twisted round their hats ; THATCHERS with a fragment of straw ; SHEPHERDS with crooks . A gig cuts GABRIEL off from our view and we pick up FARMER BOLDWOOD as he descends from his place . He is a strongly built farmer in his early forties , with a severe , lined face , well-dressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-groomed , his carriage trim . BOLDWOOD , without swagger but with considerable dignity , approaches the crowds of MEN looking for work . &nbsp; BOLDWOODWhat work are you after ? &nbsp; GABRIELBailiff , sir . &nbsp; BOLDWOOD ( passes on ) I 'm wanting a shepherd . He is promptly besieged by SHEPHERDS . GABRIEL bites his lip . Another FARMER comes up . &nbsp; GABRIELLooking for a bailiff , sir ? &nbsp; FARMERNo . Shepherd .

GABRIEL sighs and goes to where a bunch of SHEPHERDS are waiting . Behind the LABOURERS , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CHILDREN watch in sullen anxiety . A SHEPHERD by GABRIEL coughs and coughs . The FARMERS inspect the LABOURERS with shameless determination to get the strongest man at the lowest price . One FARMER even feels a MAN 's biceps. 29A . EXT . THE PRODUCE MARKET . DAY .

The LABOURER looks round at his WIFE and the CHILDREN . We use this dialogue to cover a series of CUTS of the families of the LABOURERS and of the HANGERS-ON , many with hungry and ragged CHILDREN . The GENTRY pass without arrogance but without any conscience among these wretched people , striking bargains . BOLDWOOD concludes his bargain with a shilling advance . Produce is also being sold , livestock examined and so on . &nbsp; GABRIELWanting a shepherd , sir ? &nbsp; FARMERWhere you from ? &nbsp; GABRIELNorcombe . &nbsp; FARMERLong way .

The WOMAN who tested the cabbage is still bargain hunting . &nbsp; STALLHOLDERThree farthings . The WOMAN opens her purse and takes the cabbage with an air of real achievement . &nbsp; pp. 20-41 31 . EXT . THE MARKET PLACE . EVENING . The LABOURER who has been hired by BOLDWOOD is giving bread to his family . We ease back from him to include the remnants of the LABOURERS who have not been hired . GABRIEL is standing among them . No more FARMERS are coming along . A clock is striking . GABRIEL watches as BOLDWOOD and his FRIENDS come by in their carriages . We hold on this complacent procession for a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accompany it . LABOURERS tip their caps to the FARMERS who have hired them . The last carriage passes out of frame and reveals GABRIEL , hope gone , but determined not to give in to gloom , playing his flute with gay abandon for the benefit of those LABOURERS who , cheered by success or staving off disappointment , are dancing and singing to his accompaniment under the shadow of the Corn Exchange . Successful LABOURERS and generous PASSERSBY toss pennies or halfpennies to him . The scene loses sound at last , so that the smiling faces and the nimble dancing take on a dreamlike air . The evening fades . The creaking of wheels comes to our ears .  --  20  --  32 . EXT . LANE . NIGHT . Out of the darkness looms a cart , with two MEN on the box . BILLY SMALLBURY , a cheerful man with a gloomy manner , and JOSEPH POORGRASS , a blushful , sententious sort of fellow , whom we shall later find to be BATHSHEBA 's WAGGONER . The cart swings past and we see , stealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , GABRIEL is eating some slices of ham and bread and swigging cider from a stone bottle . &nbsp; BILLYShe 's a fine handsome body , your new mistress , far as looks be concerned . &nbsp; POORGRASSSo ' a do seem , so ' a do seem . &nbsp; BILLY ( after a pause ) ' T is said , every night at going to bed she looks in the glass to put on her night-cap properly .

Ruddy light playing on GABRIEL 's face . He might be blushing . But he is n't . He frowns and looks over the side of the cart . &nbsp; POORGRASSWell , well , Billy Smallbury , well , well . And how 's she going to pay ? How 's she going to pay ? Can you tell me that ? &nbsp; BILLYThat I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . GABRIEL has quickly spotted the cause of the ruddy light . As the two LABOURERS chat on slowly , we see , from GABRIEL 's P.O.V. , that flames are leaping and then dying down in a rickyard about half a mile away . ( CONTINUED )  --  21  --  GABRIEL drops off the back of the cart and vaults a gate into a ploughed field and starts to run towards the fire . Dialogue continues , placidly , over : &nbsp; BILLY'Twere a funny thing to do , leaving a farm to a woman . I never thought old Mr. Everdene 'd leave his farm to a woman . &nbsp; POORGRASSHis nearest relation , she is . Looks in the class to put on her night cap properly ! &nbsp; BILLYHe were a shrewd man . &nbsp; POORGRASSThat 's a vain feymell all right . &nbsp; BILLYMaster Poorgrass .... &nbsp; POORGRASSThat 's a vain feymell . &nbsp; BILLYI 've a notion something 's on fire .

GABRIEL runs harder and harder , vaulting another gate and running down towards the rick-yard . Sparks shoot up . And now we see them landing on the top of another rick , one of a row which stand near the burning one . The situation is urgent . A roll of straw topples off the rick and the flames burst out with a roar . &nbsp; POORGRASS ( at last ) I think you 're quite likely right . 35 . EXT . BATHSHEBA 'S FARM . RICK YARD . NIGHT . GABRIEL leaps into a scene of pandemonium . LABOURERS are running about in all directions . No one knows what to do . Names are being called .

Under her instructions , buckets of water are brought and sluiced on to the site so that the whole place can be cleared . It is a scene of great energy and enthusiasm on the part of the LABOURERS who seem to be inspired by BATHSHEBA 's determination . BATHSHEBA stands apart from the work , making sure that all goes properly . As she turns to go back towards the house we ZOOM BACK right across the valley . 41 . EXT . BOLDWOOD 'S FARM . DAY . BOLDWOOD is standing outside his farmhouse with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which we have had of BATHSHEBA has obviously been his .

MARYANN MONEY , the charwoman , is dusting and tidying the parlour , which is being turned out . &nbsp; BATHSHEBAOh Liddy ! I wonder if I shall ever be able to keep it up . Do you think I will ? &nbsp; LIDDYI 'm sure you will , Madam . &nbsp; BATHSHEBA ( decisively ) So am I !

BOLDWOOD arrives at the front of his house , dismounts and hands the reins of his cob to his groom . He squares his shoulders and goes into the house . We go with him and get a sense of his well-ordered establishment with its well-polished floors , its portraits of naval ancestors , its furniture , a good deal more elegant than the solid rustic oak which fills Weatherbury Farm . The servants are working , and if they are not , they soon jump to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back of the house where there is a kind of large conservatory in which a number of trays of seedlings , all carefully ticketed and dated , are being treated with various kinds of fertilisers . BOLDWOOD is obviously deeply interested in the whole science of farming and extremely methodical in his own researches . There is a stove with a thermometer . BOLDWOOD checks the growth of the various seedlings and the temperature of the stove and makes notes accordingly . &nbsp; LIDDY ( OVER ) All he cares about is his farm and growing things and everything being as neat as he knows how to make it . &nbsp; MARYANN ( OVER ) They say he 's as scientifical as a man can be .  --  40  --  56 .

BATHSHEBA has looked very severe with MARYANN , but now she smiles , almost giggles at LIDDY . She picks up the Valentine and looks at it closely .

TROY looks at his MATE with a mixture of shame and nonchalance and draws out his watch , a handsome gold half hunter , from his pocket . A group of devout WOMEN who have been blessed by the VICAR at the end of matins , are now turning their busy eyes on TROY , to whom the VICAR is now beckoning . &nbsp; FIRST WOMAN ( whispers ) Wedding ! &nbsp; SECOND WOMANI would n't keep a man like that waiting , I can tell you . &nbsp; FIRST WOMANYou wo n't get the chance , I can tell you .

Can you believe it ? I went to All Souls ' . Can you believe it ? &nbsp; TROYI believe it very well . We now see that his expression shares none of her gaiety .

Over the end of this scene , the great bell of the church is tolling twelve o'clock , but now the sound is more funereal than rejoicing .

BOLDWOOD checks his own watch with the clock and then looks once again with a fixed expression at once contemptuous and almost hopeful , at the ( CONTINUED )  --  45  --  Valentine . We hear giggles from LIDDY and BATHSHEBA over this and then the sound of the gig being brought to the front door and BOLDWOOD takes the Valentine off the mantelpiece , thinks to tear it up , and then goes and locks it in a bureau drawer . 65 .

A spring boils up and runs across the road so that the gig has to go through it with a whoosh of spray . Now all is soft , springing with life . BOLDWOOD 's face is checkered with sun and green shadow . The hips of the horse drawing the trap move , supple and rhythmical , before his eyes . Moving down hill , the horse stretches out , and the rhythm increases . BOLDWOOD 's face seems to grow more animated as the shadows flick faster and faster across it . 67-69 . CUT . 70 . EXT .

BATHSHEBA listens to his plausible chat and seems quite taken in by his charm . He offers the grain , tipping it into the palm of her hand . She inspects the grain , serious now and then suddenly , with a look of contempt , tosses the sample in the YOUNG FARMER 's face . Shouts of laughter . At the moment it showers down on him , we CUT INTO SLOW MOTION , from BOLDWOOD 's P. O. V.

He slows down and with a look of hopeful disgust finds a threepenny piece which he pushes into the dirty hand held up to him . The WOMAN shows no gratitude but stares at him , buttoned in his tweeds , with a gaudy insolence . Her breast , naked and glistening with milk , is blatant to his gaze and she lets him stare at it and curls her lip as he looks away . She walks off across a glade towards where smoke is curling up .

BOLDWOOD comes up to her and she faces him wearily . &nbsp; BOLDWOODI wish I could say courteous flatteries to you - She shakes her head : that 's not the point . &nbsp; BOLDWOODBut I have neither the power nor the patience for such things . I want you for my wife , Miss Everdene , so wildly that no other feeling can - can live in my breast . I should never have spoken out , had not - had not I been led to hope . &nbsp; BATHSHEBA ( bursting out with remorse and apprehension ) That foolish Valentine - &nbsp; BOLDWOOD ( a wounded cry ) No . Not foolish - &nbsp; BATHSHEBAThat foolish , wanton Valentine ! BOLDWOOD flinches as if under a blow . &nbsp; BOLDWOODYou torture me to call it that . &nbsp; BATHSHEBAAnd cruel too . Foolish and wanton and cruel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything you want - no worries , no household cares - &nbsp; BATHSHEBABut I do n't love you . Oh if only you 'd pardon me my - my thoughtlessness - &nbsp; BOLDWOODNo , no , no . Do n't say thoughtlessness . Make me think it was something more - a sort of prophetic instinct - the beginning of a feeling that you would like me . She looks at him with anxious pity , helpless in the face of his passion to make her something she can not be . &nbsp; BOLDWOODSay at least that you do n't refuse me absolutely - &nbsp; BATHSHEBA ( wishing she could refuse and racked with guilt ) I must be honest - &nbsp; BOLDWOOD ( with descending force ) No . No . No . God only knows how much you are to me . &nbsp; BATHSHEBAI do n't know what to say - &nbsp; BOLDWOOD ( eagerly ) Then say nothing . And let me speak to you again on the subject ? &nbsp; BATHSHEBA ( nods ) I want to go home now . &nbsp; BOLDWOODI will call upon you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Please give me a little time - time to - to consider - ( CONTINUED )  --  54  --  &nbsp; BOLDWOOD ( agrees resolutely ) Of course . Any time . I am happier now . I - &nbsp; BATHSHEBA ( alarmed ) No , really - you must n't - you must n't think - I must think . &nbsp; BOLDWOODYes . And I 'll wait . BATHSHEBA walks away from him as if through treacle , guilt-laden and held back by the force of his brooding attention . As she goes away from us we HOLD her , from BOLDWOOD 's P. O. V. in the ZOOM , so that in spite of walking from us , she remains in the same perspective and so seems positively held back by BOLDWOOD 's look . It seems to be only with the greatest effort that she finally goes away out of sight . We HOLD on BOLDWOOD 's face at the end of the scene , and before it ends , the sound of whirring and the sizzle of metal against stone fills the valley like the swarming of steel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . DAY . By one of the outbuildings is a whetstone on which GABRIEL , with CAINY BALL turning the stone , is sharpening his shears for the sheepshearing . GABRIEL snips the air to test the blades and then signals to CAINY to turn the wheel . As the sparks fly , BATHSHEBA , in a different costume , her arms full of flowers , comes from the garden . GABRIEL looks across at her and she meets his glance with a slightly rueful and imploring look . She hesitates , as they start grinding again , and then comes over . &nbsp; BATHSHEBACainy , would you mind taking these to Liddy for me ? I 'll turn the stone . CAINY takes the flowers . GABRIEL says nothing , but allows BATHSHEBA to turn the handle . The wheel is not round and it whirls , hypnotically , flashing in our faces , sparks flying , with a bilious rhythm . BATHSHEBA stops and blinks . GABRIEL makes no move towards her . He waits for her . &nbsp; BATHSHEBAYou turn , Gabriel . I 'll hold the shears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowing very well that she is aching to speak out . He gives her the shears , on which he has lavished exact care , and begins slowly to turn the grindstone . &nbsp; BATHSHEBAI wanted to ask you if the men made any observation on my going off with Mr. Boldwood yesterday ? In her anxiety , she grinds the shears unevenly and GABRIEL winces before answering with cool humour . &nbsp; GABRIELYes , they did . ( winces again ) You do n't hold them right , Miss - like this - He lets go the stone and takes her hands and encloses them in his , demonstrating . &nbsp; GABRIELIncline the edge so - He holds the hands and shows her how the edge should go against the stone . BATHSHEBA allows it and then breaks free deliberately . &nbsp; BATHSHEBASuppose you turn the winch - He goes back to the wheel and turns it . &nbsp; BATHSHEBADid they think it odd ? &nbsp; GABRIELOdd was not the idea , Miss . &nbsp; BATHSHEBAWhat did they say ? &nbsp; GABRIELThat Farmer Boldwood 's name and your own were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was out . The sparks fly in a great shower . GABRIEL winces again . &nbsp; BATHSHEBA ( stops grinding ) That 's absolute nonsense . There 's ( CONTINUED )  --  56  --  &nbsp; BATHSHEBA ( contd. ) not a word of truth in it and you 're to tell them so . GABRIEL grins at her nerve . &nbsp; GABRIEL ( come off it ! ) Well , now , Bathsheba ! &nbsp; BATHSHEBAMiss Everdene , you mean . &nbsp; GABRIELI mean this , Miss Everdene. ( takes the shears from her ) I mean this . If Mr. Boldwood really spoke to you of marriage , I 'm not going to put it about that he did n't , just to please you . GABRIEL is red with frustration and humiliation . &nbsp; GABRIELI 've already tried to please you too much for my own good . &nbsp; BATHSHEBAI only want you to tell them that I 'm not going to marry him , that 's all . He nods , looking at her rather reproachfully . &nbsp; BATHSHEBAOh I know you think I 've behaved badly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't marry you ! &nbsp; GABRIEL ( shakes his head ) I 've long ceased thinking about that . &nbsp; BATHSHEBAOr wishing it , I suppose ? ( CONTINUED )  --  57  --  &nbsp; GABRIELLeading a man on you do n't care for just for the fun of it ... &nbsp; BATHSHEBAI will not be criticised ! I will not be criticised ! &nbsp; GABRIELI know . &nbsp; BATHSHEBAI warn you . I will not . Having goaded him into the frankness she wanted , she can not stand it . She turns away , tight-lipped and walks off towards the house . He holds the shears up to the light and shakes his head : she 's ruined the edge . 76 . INT/EXT . SHEEP SHEARING BARN . WEATHERBURY FARM . DAY . Naked , shivering sheep come stumbling out at one end of the barn , while sheep with heavy , clean fleeces wait , penned , at the other . CAINY BALL marks the fleeced sheep with B.E . on their clean rumps as they come out . GABRIEL with the shears in good trim is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and delivered to him just as we hear : &nbsp; CAINYMorning , Miss Everdene . GABRIEL looks up and sees BATHSHEBA 's profile in the barn door . He watches a second too long and the shears snip too deep . A convulsive jerk from the sheep and GABRIEL looks down at the blood . He makes a furious face , ashamed of his unprofessional conduct , and daubs a great blot of blue antiseptic on the place , from a pot kept handy . BATHSHEBA looks as the blue spotted sheep comes naked from the barn and her eyes meet GABRIEL 's staring out at her , half reproachful , half-ashamed . She looks cold as ice at him . TWO WOMEN with a great basin of freshly made cheese go stumbling with their heavy burden across the yard . ( CONTINUED )  --  58  --  &nbsp; CAINY ( to BATHSHEBA ) There 'll be some lordly junketing tonight , Miss , I should n't wonder . BATHSHEBA barely shows that she has heard . But then she turns from her hard look and we see a flicker of doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BATHSHEBAWhen the work 's done , Cainy Ball , when the work 's done ! The next sheep comes out and CAINY puts B.E . on it in bold letters . CLOSE on them and pp. 20-41 &nbsp; pp. 59-79 77 . INT . BOLDWOOD 'S DRAWING ROOM . EVENING . The face of a seal being pressed home on hot wax . The seal comes away and we see the initials W.B. The wax is roughly heart shaped . The letter is addressed to Miss Bathsheba Everdene ( BOLDWOOD turns it over and inspects it ) . He looks again at the seal and over all this we hear the singing from the sheep-shearing supper at Weatherbury Farm . Very slowly BOLDWOOD pulls the flap of the envelope open , ripping through the W.B. heart . He takes out the letter , which begins " Dear Bathsheba ... " ( no need for insert ) and slowly crumples it in his hand , making a fresh resolution . The singing louder . 78 . INT/EXT . WEATHERBURY FARMHOUSE . EVENING . The shearing-supper is in progress and songs are being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( singing ) I 've lost my love and I care not , I 've lost my love and I care not ; I shall soon have another , That 's better that t' other ; I 've lost my love and I care not . We EASE IN on the supper table , laden with lavish food and drink . The table is set so that one end projects through the open window of the farmhouse . BATHSHEBA sits inside the house , though at the head of the same table at which her LABOURERS are sitting out in the yard . She looks flushed and excited and very beautiful . The light from the sunset lays red and gold tongues across the faces of the LABOURERS as they tuck in . ( CONTINUED )  --  59  --  GABRIEL sits at the bottom of the table , in the other place of honour , facing BATHSHEBA at the far end . &nbsp; BATHSHEBANow Joseph , let 's have your song . &nbsp; POORGRASSMine , Ma'am ? &nbsp; BATHSHEBACome on ! &nbsp; POORGRASS ( sings ) I sow-ed th-e ... ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sow-ed the seeds of love , I-it was all i-in the-e spring ... BOB COGGAN ( the COOK 's son ) starts to laugh and tries to control himself by stuffing the tablecloth into his mouth . &nbsp; POORGRASS ( sings on ) I-in A-pril , Ma-ay , and sunny June , When sma-all bi-irds they do sing ! POORGRASS blushes and nods as they all clap . &nbsp; BATHSHEBANext verse , Mr. Poorgrass ! They all laugh and thump the table . &nbsp; POORGRASS ( starts again ) O the wi-il-lo-ow tree will twist ... BOB COGGAN can not control himself . He bursts out with a great honking guffaw and his father , JAN , catches him a great clout round the ear which knocks him off the bench and flat on his back . More raucous laughter and much drinking . BATHSHEBA signals to GABRIEL who goes along the table and leans across the sill to talk to her . &nbsp; BATHSHEBADo you have your flute with you ? GABRIEL nods and smiles warmly . She avoids his glance now . ( CONTINUED )  --  60  --  &nbsp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then bangs on the table . &nbsp; GABRIELCan we have a bit of quiet for the Mistress ? Ooh ! There is an appreciative buzz and BOB COGGAN climbs back onto his seat . The flute starts up . As BATHSHEBA starts to sing " The Banks of Allan Water " . 79 . EXT . WEATHERBURY FARM . THE VALLEY . EVENING . Against the red of the sunset we hear the clopping of hooves and see the trap , driven by BOLDWOOD , coming along the road which joins the entrances of the two farms and turn in at the drive of Weatherbury Farm . BATHSHEBA continues to sing over this . 80 . INT/EXT . THE FARMHOUSE . EVENING . The eyes of the LABOURERS are on BATHSHEBA , but as the BOLDWOOD trap gets closer , the eyes begin to swivel and the odd surreptitious nudge takes place . Eyes go back and forth . The hooves slacken and we hear the sound of footsteps . BATHSHEBA is watching . BOLDWOOD walks the length of the table , signalling to GABRIEL to continue playing . BATHSHEBA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door of the farmhouse , which LIDDY opens , a candelabrum of lighted candles in her hand . BOLDWOOD joins BATHSHEBA , with the freshly lit candles blooming golden behind them . &nbsp; BATHSHEBA ( sings on ) For his bride a soldier sought her , And a winning tongue had he : On the banks of Allan Water None was gay as she ! BOLDWOOD 's voice has joined in , bass and mellow , at the last couplet . The LABOURERS all clap . BATHSHEBA thanks GABRIEL politely . She then says something to LIDDY , who comes and closes the shutters , almost in GABRIEL 's face , though with no malicious intention . ( CONTINUED )  --  61  --  The LABOURERS keep up their applause and laughing good humour and more cider is passed . One or two belch heartily , COGGAN drains a huge quart pot . POORGRASS is asleep on his neighbour 's shoulder and MARK CLARK starts intoning a bawdy song to suit the occasion . GABRIEL withdraws slightly and shakes out his flute and gazes at the closed shutters and hears the soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) When I was young , many troubles I got , I wanted a sommat and did n't know what , To marry a wife I thought a good plan , For a woman , they said , was the comfort of man . GABRIEL , with good natured firmness , picks up MARK 's tankard and puts it to the singer 's lips , forcing him to drink and to stop his suggestive song . GABRIEL tips the tankard back hard so that the drink runs all down MARK 's chin and into his collar . The others laugh . 81 . INT . THE DOWNSTAIRS ROOM . THE FARMHOUSE . NIGHT . BOLDWOOD and BATHSHEBA alone . BATHSHEBA is behind a low arm-chair , on which BOLDWOOD is kneeling , holding one of her hands in both of his . &nbsp; BATHSHEBA ( as if in reply to him ) I will try to love you . And if I can believe in any way that I could make you a good wife I shall indeed be willing to marry you ... &nbsp; BOLDWOODOh Miss Everdene ! &nbsp; BATHSHEBABut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . &nbsp; BOLDWOODYou will not regret it . If it is in my power , you shall not regret it . He clasps her hand and kisses it passionately . &nbsp; BOLDWOODWhen can I - when can I hope to hear - ( CONTINUED )  --  62  --  &nbsp; BATHSHEBA ( gently ) I sha n't hold you in suspense a moment longer than I need - &nbsp; BOLDWOOD ( fearful of rejection ) But do n't decide too hastily . Do n't ... decide ... too hastily . &nbsp; BATHSHEBAI wo n't . Perhaps , perhaps by harvest time ... &nbsp; BOLDWOOD ( not sure if that is too long to bear or too soon to look forward to ) Harvest-time . By harvest-time I shall know . &nbsp; BATHSHEBAYou shall have your answer . ( takes back her hand , softly ) But please remember - I do n't promise yet ! &nbsp; BOLDWOODHarvest-time ! 82 . EXT . THE FARMYARD . NIGHT . GABRIEL in gayer mood is playing on his flute while the drunken LABOURERS , like Hamelin 's rats , go dancing round after him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the giddup of BOLDWOOD in his trap again and the sound of the horse starting up . The LABOURERS are near the sheep dip now , crossing the fields towards their cottages . BOLDWOOD rides up the drive past them and one or two wave a cheeky good night . &nbsp; MARKExpect he 's feeling a bit better now , should n't wonder ! BOB COGGAN lets out a great snigger at this and before they ( CONTINUED )  --  63  --  know what 's happened GABRIEL has each of them by the scruff of the neck and is propelling them towards the sheep-dip . They resist and the others chortle as GABRIEL , with a stern humour , runs them both full tilt into the deep end . &nbsp; COGGANHe warned you . You ca n't say he did n't . We see BOLDWOOD 's trap clopping along the road in the distance . The MEN gather round , mocking , as MARK and BOB haul themselves out . Section Details 83 . EXT . THE FARMHOUSE . NIGHT . BATHSHEBA , in a great cloak , comes out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shutter so that it may be closed off when not required . The light catches her face and then she moves off on her rounds . 83A . EXT . THE GRANARY . NIGHT . BATHSHEBA checks the big lock and then heads across towards the animals . We move into subjective CAMERA now . 84 . INT/EXT . COW SHED . NIGHT . With almost shock effect , C. U. of a great eye with long lashes , staring at us . The lid closes and opens and in the eye we see BATHSHEBA 's lantern and her reflection . As we PULL BACK , the eye is seen to belong to a cow . We PAN ACROSS a row of stalled cows , the lantern light gleaming and then darkness as it shuts off . 84A . EXT . THE FARM . NIGHT . Continuing in subjective CAMERA , a series of CUTS of farm animals , locked sheds , everything shipshape , as BATHSHEBA makes her final check that all is well . Eyes stare , noses twitch , ears jerk . Finally BATHSHEBA , some distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards a narrow path with a brick wall on one side and a dark fir grove on the other . 85 . EXT . THE PATH AND FIR PLANTATION . NIGHT . BATHSHEBA on the path , her lantern half-shut . BATHSHEBA ( CONTINUED )  --  64  --  suddenly freezes as she hears the sound of movement . Foot-steps ? She hurries on and suddenly there is a shape right close upon her . The lantern jerks and an eye is suddenly there in C. U. This time it is no cow . A flash of scarlet and gold and the white of a face . It is SERGEANT TROY . &nbsp; TROY ( innocently ) Good night , mate . &nbsp; BATHSHEBA ( gasps but recovers ) Good night . She brushes past him , but he rather insolently keeps close to her ( what else can he do ? ) and suddenly she is brought up short . She struggles , but ca n't get free . &nbsp; BATHSHEBALet me go ! &nbsp; TROYI have n't got you . ( mock surprise ) Is it a lady ? &nbsp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His spur has caught her dress and the material is enravelled in the rowel . &nbsp; TROYSomething seems to have happened ! If you 'll just give me the lantern a moment ... He takes it and opens the shutter . Bright light spills on his handsome face , his scarlet coat and his golden buttons , his burnished sword . It spills too on BATHSHEBA 's beautiful face , charged with excited indignation . TROY holds the lantern and looks in her face . &nbsp; TROYI 'll unfasten you in no time . He makes no move to do so . &nbsp; BATHSHEBAPlease do . He smiles broadly and holds the lantern down to see what 's ( CONTINUED )  --  65  --  happened . When he sees he bursts out laughing . &nbsp; BATHSHEBAI 'm in a hurry . &nbsp; TROY ( equably and with direct sexual challenge ) It could be a long business . Unless you want me to cut the material . &nbsp; BATHSHEBAThen cut it . TROY squats down and takes the material of her skirt and starts to unravel it . In doing so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at which he again smiles cheerily . &nbsp; TROYYou do n't want me to do that ! No need , if you 'll hang on a second . TROY looks at her , now drawn very close to him by the necessity of the operation . He turns her body with his hands and then draws her nearer to him again . All , of course , apparently without purpose or premeditation . He stops and looks again at BATHSHEBA . &nbsp; BATHSHEBAYou 're not doing anything ! &nbsp; TROYI 'm looking at a beautiful face . That 's activity enough ! One of the most beautiful faces I 've ever seen . &nbsp; BATHSHEBAIt 's unwillingly shown ! &nbsp; TROY ( laughs delightedly ) I like you the better for that incivility , I must say ! &nbsp; BATHSHEBAYou 're making it worse on purpose . Please go and leave me here . ( CONTINUED )  --  66  --  &nbsp; TROYImpossible , I 'm afraid . If I go , I shall drag you with me - and if I leave you here , I 'm absolutely bound to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from him , but he remains attached to her . &nbsp; TROYI 've seen a good many women in my time , but I 've never seen one as beautiful as you . &nbsp; BATHSHEBAWho are you ? What 're you doing here ? &nbsp; TROYMy name is Sergeant Troy . Before I entered the service of Her Majesty I used to live here . I always come back for haymaking ! &nbsp; BATHSHEBAReally ? Who 's your father ? &nbsp; TROYThat 's a complicated question , my dear ! In name , a doctor . In nature , a certain Earl with wide interests in these parts . He speaks with such fresh insolence that BATHSHEBA is quite put out - and much agitated . TROY grins and unravels the last of the material . &nbsp; TROYThere we are ! Free ! I only wish it had been the knot of knots there 's no untying ! BATHSHEBA sweeps off down the path . We watch her go from TROY 's P.O.V.

The LABOURERS at work under a warm sun , the MEN bare to the waist , their muscles working as they bend and stretch to the work . GABRIEL directs casual WORKERS to their places . BATHSHEBA on horseback rides along the boundary of the field . &nbsp; TROYMiss Everdene ! There he is , striding along the path towards GABRIEL , in working clothes with a cheery expression . &nbsp; TROY ( comes jauntily up to her ) I 'm sorry , I did n't realize it was you last night . Many 's the time I 've harvested for your Uncle . I hope you 'll let me do the same for you . He starts to strip off his jacket , with a nod at GABRIEL . BATHSHEBA watches him with attempted coldness . He smiles at her as if he knew her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You are beautiful . Beautiful ! I ca n't help saying it , I 'm a man of strong feelings !

BATHSHEBA looks at him and claps heels to her horse and rides on across the fields . TROY smiles to himself and goes jauntily to join the work .

The buzzing of bees has come in immediately over the end of the last scene and now BATHSHEBA is trying to hive the bees . She is on the ladder , covered with protective clothing - big leather gloves , a straw hat and a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place near the swarming bees so that they go into it . She climbs higher . The atmosphere is full of flowers and the golden dust of pollen . Suddenly there is a deep bass buzzing , very loud just behind . She turns to look , alarmed , and there is SERGEANT TROY , humming and grinning up at her . In shock , she slides right down the ladder and into his arms . &nbsp; TROYI must say you 're well protected ! She gets out of his arms . &nbsp; TROYLet me do that . &nbsp; BATHSHEBAYou 'll be stung to death . &nbsp; TROYDo n't sound so hopeful ! We CUT TO a NEW ANGLE and a gloved hand comes up with the hive and a deep humming noise is heard again . The straw hat and the gauze come into view and it is only when we see his trousers climb into SHOT that we realize that TROY has put on the full protective equipment . BATHSHEBA watches him from a distance . &nbsp; TROY ( calls to her ) Here they come ! Here they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hive at arm 's length and with a cloud of bees following him .

Heavens , holding up that hive makes your arm ache worse than a week 's sword exercise and that 's something I can tell you ! BATHSHEBA puts her arms round him to undo the gauze . &nbsp; BATHSHEBAIs it very strenuous then ? &nbsp; TROYStrenuous ? Have you never seen it ? BATHSHEBA shakes her head . 92 . EXT . WOODLANDS . DAY . TROY carrying his sword in its scabbard marching like an explorer , swaggering , skipping , doing a mating dance almost ahead of BATHSHEBA who , laughing , infatuated and only a little nervous , follows him through the trees . 93 .

We have a sense that they are animals among animals . Their coming together is a natural event . &nbsp; TROY ( unsheathes the sword ) Now ! First we have four right and four left cuts ; four left and four right thrusts . The sword catches the sunlight as he swings it and glitters like a living thing . BATHSHEBA stares at it , enraptured . &nbsp; TROYCut one - as if you were sowing corn - so ! A streak of light , as he demonstrates .

You 're the enemy , right ? &nbsp; BATHSHEBANo ! &nbsp; TROYI sha n't touch you , that I promise you . As long as you do n't flinch , you 'll come to no harm . Are you scared ? &nbsp; BATHSHEBANo . Hup , with eye deceiving brilliance the sword cleaves this side and that of her and then TROY is there again smiling , with the sword at rest . &nbsp; TROYSure you 're not scared ? &nbsp; BATHSHEBA ( nods ) Sure . ( small voice ) Is it - is it very sharp ? ( CONTINUED )  --  71  --  &nbsp; TROYNo - not a bit . Got no edge at all ! Still now ! The sun shines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its patterns round BATHSHEBA . It has again the quality of a dance or ritual or both , this slashing rainbow of steel which encircles BATHSHEBA . We see much of it from BATHSHEBA 's P.O.V. and the sword seems re-duplicated into infinite bars of light . The effect is of a burning brand being whipped about inches from our eyes . Photographically we use every technique possible to create dramatic visual images , both of the sword and of TROY 's face and body as he concentrates on his arrogant demonstration . &nbsp; TROYThere 's a caterpillar on you ! So there is ! On her bodice . &nbsp; TROYDo n't move ! Flash ! And there it is on the point of TROY 's sword . &nbsp; TROYWait a minute , there 's a lock of hair needs tidying ! Flash !

He bends down and picks up the lock of hair . &nbsp; TROYMay I ? He puts it in his pocket . She nods . The whole world is still spinning . He comes close to her now and steadies her .

He shakes his head , collects his rabbits and puts them in his bag and then sets off , wrinkling his brow at what he 's seen , towards the village . He starts to trot . 94 . EXT . THE FARM . THE SHEEP WASHING POOL . DAY . BATHSHEBA comes on an almost drunken course through the stubble towards the pool . She seems to inhale the whole joy of the countryside . She reaches the pool , hot-faced and fiery with excitement . She looks round and then lowers her face to the pool , closer and closer , till she seems to kiss her own lips , lapping the water .

Next to the TINKER is another figure , muffled also in a multicoloured cloak . The TINKER looks at him and a slow face comes out from the cover .

DAY . START ON : a horse marching stolidly into the sea . A bathing machine is being towed out to deep water . CUT TO : LOW ANGLE SHOT , looking sharply upwards . BATHSHEBA 's face comes over the top of the sea wall and looks down . She watches for a moment and then hurries down the ramp which leads to the beach . Now we see the whole beach scene , with bathing machines and properly dressed CITIZENS and WOMEN taking their stilted ease on the beach . A CONCERT PARTY performing to a small CROWD , VENDORS parading , etc. , etc . The CITIZENS are mostly in dark clothes , though the WOMEN have parasols and look quite " feminine " for all their overdressed style . BATHSHEBA , in her light-coloured costume ( white or pale blue ) , is in innocent contrast . BATHSHEBA heads towards the CONCERT PARTY , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what she has already seen , the gleam of scarlet among the sombre clothes . TROY and the CORPORAL are watching the performance , with an eye on any young GIRLS who might be similarly minded . BATHSHEBA reaches TROY , who reacts with surprised pleasure at her appearance . She is tense , but is forced to a small smile by his broad grin . She walks away , accompanied by him , leaving the CORPORAL looking at the show . A one legged SAILOR is doing his turn nearby , where a group of DRINKERS are listening to his tales of derring-do . He has a pole with a frame on top where a series of blood-curdling pictures are hung in such a way that they can be shown one at a time , to illustrate the story . TROY is intrigued by the pictures of native girls , sea-fights , etc. , and during the following dialogue allows his eyes to stray to them , without being blatantly rude to BATHSHEBA or seeming in any way to be bored or angered by her .

TROY looks warmly at her . &nbsp; BATHSHEBAIt 's what has to be . That 's what I 've come to tell you . She looks nervously - and inquisitively around . &nbsp; TROYI see . At least you 'll let me show you the town . She shakes her head , but wants to agree . &nbsp; TROYWe 're a long way from Weatherbury . His hand travels down her arm and takes her hand . She tries , but not too hard , to disengage her fingers . He looks her full in the face . Her fingers relax and he squeezes her hand . &nbsp; TROYYou really are a beautiful creature .

The local CARTER 's cart is coming into town and there sitting in the back , whistling softly to himself and eating some nuts out of a large paper bag and spitting the shells down into the roadway is TROY , swinging his legs and carefree as you please .

BOLDWOOD in menacing C.U . &nbsp; TROY ( equably ) That 's my name . &nbsp; BOLDWOODI 'm William Boldwood . &nbsp; TROYOh yes ? Good evening . &nbsp; BOLDWOODI want a word with you . TROY looks insolently at BOLDWOOD and nods curtly . &nbsp; BOLDWOODAbout her who lives up there - ( he can not mention Bathsheba 's name to TROY ) - and about a woman you 've cruelly wronged and should have married . &nbsp; TROYDo you really ?

A kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TROYFirst of all , she 's disappeared , and secondly , I 'm too poor . He watches BOLDWOOD rather cruelly . He takes a nut from his bag and cracks it between his teeth .

Leave her to me and marry Fanny as you intended - she 's beyond you anyway . TROY stares at him . He walks on thoughtfully , BOLDWOOD with him .  --  85  --  117 . EXT . WEATHERBURY FARM .

We EASE IN now to catch TROY 's face in the light of a cottage window . &nbsp; TROYYes . Very . ( weighing it up ) Fifty pounds right away , you said . BOLDWOOD produces a small bag , which chinks richly as he passes it to TROY who , looking full in the other 's face , takes it humbly . BOLDWOOD looks full of contempt and relief and unexpected joy . &nbsp; TROYIt seems you counted on me accepting . Suddenly there is extra light on the night scene . The door of the farmhouse has opened and there is BATHSHEBA , with her lantern , and she is coming down the drive towards them . She whistles softly . TROY watches BOLDWOOD 's face . &nbsp; TROYI 'm afraid she 's expecting me . I suppose I 'd better go and wish her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the necessity . Why ca n't you just go ? &nbsp; TROYShe 'll only wander around looking for me . You know women ! Tell you what , you shall hear all I say to her . It 'll help you in your love-making when I 'm gone ! BOLDWOOD looks at him suspiciously , but TROY manages an ( CONTINUED )  --  86  --  innocent air . BOLDWOOD nods and they go towards the farmhouse as BATHSHEBA whistles again . TROY whistles back . BOLDWOOD is anguished by this sign of intimacy . &nbsp; BATHSHEBAFrank , my darling - is that you ? &nbsp; TROY ( to BOLDWOOD ) Wait here . We HOLD ON BOLDWOOD 's face . TROY puts his bag down and goes forward to BATHSHEBA . &nbsp; BATHSHEBAOh , Frank , you were so long ! ( embraces him and whispers ) I 've got rid of everyone . There 'll be no one in the house but us . He grins at her . &nbsp; TROYYou go in . I 'll be back in a moment . I 've left my bag . &nbsp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute . Promise . She smiles and clasps his hand and goes . We are BACK ON BOLDWOOD as TROY comes back . TROY looks at BOLDWOOD . Now what ? &nbsp; TROYYou see my difficulty . BOLDWOOD leaps at him and grabs him by the throat . They wrestle furiously in the darkness , stumbling against the hedge . BOLDWOOD has TROY in a throttling grip . &nbsp; BOLDWOODI 'll kill you ... &nbsp; TROYAnd ruin her . &nbsp; BOLDWOODAnd save her . ( CONTINUED )  --  87  --  &nbsp; TROYHow can she be saved now unless I - ( chokes ) - marry her ? BOLDWOOD groans and throws TROY into the hedge amid the tearing brambles . TROY recovers himself . BOLDWOOD stands there , the inevitable boring in on him . &nbsp; BOLDWOODYou 're right . She must love you indeed to - to - you must marry her - you must - now - &nbsp; TROYFanny or Bathsheba ? I want to be quite sure I do what you want . &nbsp; BOLDWOOD ( no jokes ) Bathsheba - you must .

The whistle is heard again . BOLDWOOD restrains TROY instinctively , but TROY goes forward . &nbsp; TROYShe has a right to approve of the arrangement , do n't you agree ? TROY picks up his bag , signalling to BOLDWOOD to accompany him . BOLDWOOD does so . 118 . EXT . THE FARMHOUSE . NIGHT . BOLDWOOD is stopped by TROY , who goes into the house and ( CONTINUED )  --  88  --  shuts the door . We LIFT , from BOLDWOOD 's P.O.V. to the lighted bedroom window . BOLDWOOD suffers . TROY comes to the window . &nbsp; TROY ( leans on the sill ) Mr. Boldwood - BOLDWOOD comes forward , his face pale , confused . &nbsp; TROYNow what was the arrangement ? Fifty pounds to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marry Fanny ! Fifty pounds to marry Bathsheba ! Only one snag really . Do you know what that is , Mr. Boldwood ? We 're married already ! BOLDWOOD stands there , transfixed . &nbsp; TROY ( as if shaming a small boy ) You say you love Bathsheba , yet you believed at once she 'd invite me here , unwed , like a harlot ! Is that what you call love ? It 's not what I call love . He throws the money and it strikes BOLDWOOD , who makes no attempt to prevent it , in the face . BOLDWOOD reels back , purple with pain . TROY gives a laugh and pulls the curtains across the window . BOLDWOOD looks at the bag of sovereigns lying in the mud . He turns and stumbles away , leaving them there . BOLDWOOD groans to himself and blunders across the dark countryside , literally like a wounded animal . 119 . MONTAGE SEQUENCE . In BOLDWOOD 's troubled state , the whole landscape seems to heave and pump as if a living , writhing being . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his progress hand-held , as he blunders across country . ) Cross-cut with this , so that the images blend in one pulsating continuum , TROY and BATHSHEBA making love in the darkened room , so that branches become arms , hair grass , etc. , writhing in BOLDWOOD 's almost insane vision . ( CONTINUED )  --  89  --  The sounds of BATHSHEBA 's amorous sighs and TROY 's soft endearments contrast with the blundering moans of BOLDWOOD , but this very inexplicit and in a tactfully muted key . BOLDWOOD 's moan to have a chilling monotony . As the sequence ends , in a kind of stillness , we hear the triumphant crowing of a cock , strident and lord-of-the-roosty . MIX TO : Section Details 120 . EXT . WEATHERBURY FARMHOUSE . DAY . The cock strutting proudly . The sound of a window opening and we PAN UP to TROY , greeting the morning and his fellow spirit , the red-crested , arrogant cock . A gang of LABOURERS , arriving for work , come past the house as TROY is leaning out and he grins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; TROYMorning ! They nod and look at each other , MARK CLARK , HENERY FRAY , MATTHEW MOON . They see ' em come and they see ' em go . They also see a bag of sovereigns , half of them spilt out and gleaming in the early sun where they fell at BOLDWOOD 's feet . No one says anything , but they are uneasy as they go on by . TROY takes a deep breath and turns and smiles into the room . The harvest hymn comes in over this last second of the scene . 121 . CUT . 122 . INT . THE CHURCH . DAY . TROY in a fine set of new civilian clothes , stands arrogantly by BATHSHEBA . He takes the Earl 's gold watch from his pocket and inspects the hour importantly .

As the hymn proceeds , we get QUICK CUTS of sections of cut fields , ears of wheat hanging from the shaggy edges of ricks , all the signs of a well garnered harvest . In the middle of a field , TROY 's red jacket with the Sergeant 's stripes on it flutters on a broomstick which has been erected as a scarecrow . We move quickly on past it . The last CUTS are as darkness comes on , with dark clouds coming up on the horizon . We EASE BACK from the last SHOT of sheep moving nose to tail restlessly on a bleak slab of hillside to include GABRIEL OAK , his face dark and thoughtful , his whole body strong as a force of nature .

TROY goes to where BATHSHEBA is sitting and draws her to her feet . &nbsp; TROYCome on , The Soldier 's Joy . As they all applaud , we EASE BACK to INCLUDE GABRIEL once more as he ambles , anxious but uncertain of his right , into the stackyard , and looks up at the stacks and then at the thick sky , full of contrary clouds and lit with a metallic moon .  --  91  --  125 .

FRAY looks at him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across to GABRIEL . &nbsp; GABRIELAsk the Sergeant if he 'd give me a moment . FRAY nods and goes to TROY and says something to him . TROY goes on dancing and makes a face . FRAY goes back to GABRIEL . &nbsp; GABRIELJust tell him there 's going to be a storm , will you , and the ricks must be covered or they 'll be ruined . CUT BACK to TROY . &nbsp; TROY ( contemptuously ) There 's not going to be a storm ! What do you say , men , do we drink or do we work ? &nbsp; MENDrink ! &nbsp; TROY ( bangs on the table ) I want to make a speech . Friends , this is more than a harvest home , this is a Wedding Feast as well ! As you know , not so long ago this lady and I were married .

TALLHalf an hour . TROY gets the MUSICIANS started and gives the company a song , with full emphasis on the suggestive elements in it . The song continues over 126 and 127 . &nbsp; TROY ( sings ) A fair maid a-milking did go , A fair maid a-milking did go , Oh the wind did blow high and the wind did blow low , And it blew herpails to and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , She met with a man that she knew , And she boldly asked him if he 'd got any skill , For to catch her a small bird or two .

Here 's a health to the man and the maid , Here 's a health to the bird in the bush , For we 're all birds of one feather , and we 'll flock together , Let the people say little or much . Here 's a health to the man and the maid , Here 's a health to the jolly dragoon , ( CONTINUED )  --  93  --  &nbsp; TROY ( contd . ) We 've tarried here all day and drunk down the sun , Let 's tarry here and drink down the moon !

The WOMEN come out in a rush and TROY grins at them from the door as they scuttle like hens across the yard . He smiles and then turns back and goes into the next verse . 126 . EXT . THE LANE . GABRIEL 'S COTTAGE . NIGHT . GABRIEL going grimly home towards his cottage . The sounds of fiddling and laughter way off . GABRIEL looks down . A large toad looks up at him . GABRIEL grits his teeth , sighs and looks up at the sky before letting himself into his cottage . He is about to go in when he looks down and there is a slug inside the doorway .

The LABOURERS are in the last stages of drunken collapse . TROY sits on the table with the bottle to his lips . The only MUSICIAN still on his feet is playing and skipping and lurching and finally collapses with a gasp . GABRIEL makes a disgusted , helpless face . &nbsp; GABRIEL ( lifts MATTHEW MOON 's unconscious head and yells at him ) Where 's the rick ladder ? &nbsp; MATTHEW ( voice from the grave ) Under the staddles .

Suddenly there is a grating noise . GABRIEL looks over at the barn . A cock is crowing . The door slowly opens and the first shamefaced LABOURER blinks at the day , holding his head . It is JAN COGGAN . He staggers out , followed , in slow march , by the other LABOURERS . Last comes TROY , less hungover than the others , stretching and scratching himself . He takes a handful of rainwater and dashes it over his face . GABRIEL looks down at them as they stumble across the yard . They look up at him with a kind of guilty indifference .

The CAMERA sweeps past her ( as if TROY hardly dared to look her in the eye ) and looks at the various " feminine " additions which BATHSHEBA has made to the room . It SWINGS BACK to her as she looks up and follows its movement with her eyes . Now it steadies and MOVES IN on her as she watches suspiciously . We STOP a few feet from BATHSHEBA who looks .

TROY catches her wrist and pulls her back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money . I need it .

She bursts into violent sobs and half-attacks him physically , half-entreats him by throwing herself at him . He is alarmed at her fury and impatient with it too . Her passion throws him off balance and he drops the bag of money , from which a couple of sovereigns spill . He goes down on the floor , with a sheepish bravado , and recovers them . At the same time , he tries to calm BATHSHEBA . &nbsp; TROYFor heaven 's sake do n't be so desperate ! 155 . EXT . CASTERBRIDGE WORK HOUSE . NIGHT .

TROY comes across in the gig , gay and self-confident . He stops and looks at his watch . FARMERS and WOMEN go by on their way up to market . 159 . EXT . THE WORK-HOUSE . DAY . The sinister back door of the workhouse opens a full three feet above pavement level .

Normal single vision : he reaches the cart , hesitates , misses his step and swings himself aboard with a crash and whips up the horse . &nbsp; POORGRASS ( sings ) I sowed the seeds of love , I so-owed the seeds of love , It was all in the spri-ing , I-in April , Ma-ay and sunny June , When small birds they do sing ...

At the same time he shakes the reins and starts on towards the house . &nbsp; GABRIELJoseph , you ought to be ashamed , drunk at such a time . &nbsp; POORGRASSNot so , shepherd , not so .

LIDDY looks at her with worried eyes , but then goes . ( CONTINUED )  --  115  --  BATHSHEBA stares into the fire and huddles for the warmth she can not find in life . Very , very subtly , almost inaudible at first , the sound of whispers invades the room and BATHSHEBA 's consciousness .

Now we EASE ROUND so that we can see that the stone is in place and also that TROY is just finishing planting a whole bed of bulbs on the thick , wet earth which the GRAVEDIGGERS so briskly replaced . TROY 's clothes are clayey , but he does n't mind . He looks up . A dark cloud is above him . Rain begins to fall . He thrusts his hands in his pockets and strolls sadly towards the gate . 177 .

TOP SHOT : the rain spilling along the gutters and spouting out through the mouths of the gargoyles . We MOVE as if with the torrent , so that we are directly above FANNY 's grave and then seem to fall down towards it .

He sighs deeply and then - hup ! - he goes head down and heels only showing and falls over backwards and comes up grinning , with a stone in his fist . He starts to strike out boldly . He turns and tries to strike back to shore , but the shore ( and our P.O.V. is his ) seems to waver and grow smaller . We hear him panting and see him , gritting his teeth .

Now the rest of the procession comes into sight . First , high on the skyline , gaily painted carts , and then coming closer into view as the whole cavalcade comes sweeping down the hill into Weatherbury . On the sides of the carts are hand-painted signs with bold ( CONTINUED )  --  136  --  images of the various acts painted on them . We notice one which reads " Captain Fortescue in the Royal Hippodrome Performance of Turpin 's Ride to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we PAN the cart past us to go down into the village we see a pair of booted and spurred legs draped languidly over the tailboard .

Plenty of the Weatherbury folk are there , including COGGAN , POORGRASS , MARK CLARK ( eagerly goosing girls ) and HENERY FRAY . They stop and point and we see that BATHSHEBA 's ex-Baily PENNYWAYS is having a sly chat with a seedy looking INDIVIDUAL . We get a thorough sense of the gaiety and vitality of the occasion and finally PICK UP BATHSHEBA , pale but determinedly brave riding with BOLDWOOD in his trap . They come by the tent which has just been fixed up outside which Black Bess , Dick Turpin 's horse , is tethered as proof of the show 's authenticity . Over all this we hear TROY 's song continuing .

TROY uses for this fight all of the swordsmanship which he once displayed so proudly to BATHSHEBA , but now it is all turns and tricks and cheap melodrama . The crowd love it .

Look after her well , she 's done me proud . He grabs PENNYWAYS and loops the reins round his arm . Roars of laughter from the Weatherbury contingent . COGGAN nudges FRAY , FRAY nudges CLARK and CLARK nudges a pretty WOMAN who is not amused . &nbsp; TROY ( with heavy double meaning ) Keep your mouth shut , tell no one that you 've seen me and you 'll not lack your proper reward , mark my words ! But speak to those you should n't and ... He rams the pistol against PENNYWAYS ' throat . &nbsp; TROY ... you wo n't live to tell the tale !

When we CUT BACK TROY is back on BESS , with PENNYWAYS backing away , no longer going towards BATHSHEBA . BATHSHEBA watches with lowered eyes now . She does not recognise TROY and is uneasy at BOLDWOOD 's constant stare . &nbsp; TROY ( sings ) When the spires of York Minster now burst on my view , And the chimes they were ringing a knell , Halt !

This heavy sentiment is forcefully put over and now we see a tear rolling down COGGAN 's cheek . We PAN ALONG the row and see most of the LOCALS stifling sobs . MARK CLARK and his LADY NEIGHBOUR , however , have eyes now only for each other . The horse is hauled from the arena . ( CONTINUED )  --  142  --  Enormous applause as TROY comes on to take a bow .

In six years ' time . &nbsp; GABRIELI would n't be sure about that , sir . &nbsp; BOLDWOODAre you jealous , man ? &nbsp; GABRIELNo , sir . &nbsp; BOLDWOODIt 's true . If she gives me her word . In six years , less than six years , she 'll be mine . &nbsp; GABRIELIt 's a long time . A long time to rely on a woman 's promise . &nbsp; BOLDWOODYou 're wrong .

( CONTINUED )  --  146  --  She looks at the GIRL and there is , in spite of her tone , a hint of challenge and excitement in her eyes . 204 . CUT 205 . INT . BOLDWOOD 'S HOUSE . EVENING . BOLDWOOD with his tie done , stands at the head of the stair looking down at the bustle below ( platters being carried across , MUSICIANS unloading their instruments etc. ) and stares at the swinging mistletoe over the front door . He walks away across the landing , taking out a key from his waistcoat pocket . He inserts the key , trembling , in a door , and , with a nervous glance over his shoulder , goes inside . 206 . INT . BOLDWOOD 'S SECRET ROOM . EVENING . BOLDWOOD shuts the door and relocks it . We have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed and an air of daintiness . BOLDWOOD lights the lamp and now his full fantasy blooms before us . He has furnished the room for his and BATHSHEBA 's wedding chamber . There is the double bed , there her dressing table with silver brushes and tortoiseshell trinket boxes and there , on a tailor 's dummy , is her wedding gown , the very image of her without the flesh and blood to make it real . BOLDWOOD breathes in the delicate scent of the room , inspects the dressing table and , opening a drawer , takes out a jeweller 's box and opens it to reveal ( in C.U . now ) BATHSHEBA 's engagement ring . He takes it out and rolls it between thumb and forefinger . He takes it to the tailor 's dummy and rehearses its presentation . He presses his face to the tailor 's dummy . He returns the ring to his box and puts it in his pocket . He opens the cupboard doors and the full extent of his obsession is underlined in the rows of female clothes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window , hearing horse 's hooves . 207 . EXT . THE DRIVE . BOLDWOOD 'S FARM . NIGHT . Great flambeaux have been set along the drive and they flame and flicker with a hellish unnaturalness . Between them comes BATHSHEBA 's gig , the light blinking on her face and on MARK CLARK 's , who drives her and LIDDY . The gig goes into slow motion , from BOLDWOOD 's P.O.V. The moment of consummation spun out into fantasy .  --  147  --  208 . INT . THE HALL . BOLDWOOD 'S . NIGHT . Holly and ivy and all the Christmas cheer . BOLDWOOD signals furiously to the MUSICIANS to start up their music , urges the SERVANTS to pour drinks and the GUESTS to begin the merriment . Like automata , they all obey , as if actors in a play , not participants in a pleasure . 209 . EXT . BOLDWOOD 'S HOUSE . NIGHT . Furious music behind , but again subtle slow motion as BOLDWOOD hands BATHSHEBA down from the gig . 210 . INT . BOLDWOOD 'S HALL . NIGHT . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BOLDWOOD 's hopes , leaning on his arm as though they were indeed betrothed . The GUESTS , LOCALS of all kinds , invited with the reckless profligacy which a miser shows once in a lifetime , LABOURERS , GENTRY ( minor gentry ) , the one lot at the bottom , the other at the top of the hall , draw apart to leave an alley down which BOLDWOOD and BATHSHEBA advance , like minor royalty . BATHSHEBA is sick with apprehension , but reacts to the admiration . In front of the fire a whole sheep turns slowly , blushing in the flames and based by a KITCHEN BOY , himself red and dripping with exertion and heat . BOLDWOOD reluctantly introduces BATHSHEBA to a rich FARMER and his LADY and has to go and meet other ARRIVALS . He looks back longingly , but BATHSHEBA is glad to be with others . 211 . EXT . THE DRIVEWAY , BOLDWOOD 'S . NIGHT . Groups of LABOURERS , the real proles , stand watching the carriages roll up and look at each other . They are like some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change what will happen . They look along towards the road . 212 . EXT . THE LANE . ENTRANCE TO BOLDWOOD 'S . NIGHT . TROY , his back to us , a dark figure only and not unmistakable , stares at the brilliant light and the house and listens to the music . 213 . INT . THE STUDY . BOLDWOOD 'S . NIGHT . BOLDWOOD with BATHSHEBA . Guncases and pipes , naval relics , seasoned wood and polish and leather .

Your promise . You do give it , do n't you ? I do n't ask for your love . But your promise ... &nbsp; BATHSHEBAMr . Boldwood , I am not the same woman I was when - before - &nbsp; BOLDWOODI know . I know . I expect nothing . Nothing - sentimental . I ask only for the privilege of looking after you - &nbsp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I owe it you - &nbsp; BOLDWOODYes . &nbsp; BATHSHEBAYou 've been so kind - &nbsp; BOLDWOODIn six years then , in less than six , you promise ? &nbsp; BATHSHEBAIn six years from this day - &nbsp; BOLDWOODYes . Yes . &nbsp; BATHSHEBAIf my husband does not return - &nbsp; BOLDWOODYes . ( CONTINUED )  --  149  --  He is fumbling in his pocket . &nbsp; BATHSHEBAI - ( Ghastly whisper ) will - He takes her hand and clasps it . And now he springs open the jeweller 's box and reveals the ring to her . His eyes glisten . She recoils . &nbsp; BATHSHEBANo - please - I ca n't - She makes to break free , but he holds her . She reels , desperate . &nbsp; BOLDWOODIt means only a pledge - not sentiment - not feeling - just a pledge - a promise - &nbsp; BATHSHEBAI ca n't - please let me go - &nbsp; BOLDWOODTonight . Just tonight . Wear it . Only for tonight . Please . Tonight . BATHSHEBA is beside herself . She sinks into a chair , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raises her hand to him , her eyes swimming with tears . He looks like something seen through a screen of water , as if he himself were diluted and running like a watercolour . The ring glints and sparkles . He takes her finger and slides it slowly into the ring . &nbsp; BOLDWOODSix years to this day . &nbsp; BATHSHEBA ( nods glumly ) Now I must go home . Please , I want to go home . &nbsp; BOLDWOOD ( nods ) I 'm happy . Now I 'm truly happy . BATHSHEBA sits there . BOLDWOOD presses her hand then goes out .  --  150  --  TROY starts walking slowly and purposefully towards the house . Slowly tracking forward towards the house . We HOLD ON a rustic face and then SWOOP FORWARD , then HOLD AGAIN on a group of doom-ridden faces , then FORWARD AGAIN with the music growling , the torches flaming , horses stamping their feet , forward and slow , quick and slow , in towards the music and festivities . 215 . INT . THE HALL . NIGHT . BOLDWOOD , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the WORK FOLK . ( We notice LABAN TALL taking a big bumper and then , on a look from his WIFE , replacing it , reluctantly . ) And behind this comedy , we see , for a brief instant , a face at the window . TROY 's , but so muffled that it is more ghost than reality . BOLDWOOD touches bumpers with a FARMER and raises his glass . A knock at the door . 216 . INT . THE STUDY . NIGHT . BATHSHEBA on her feet , inspecting her face in a glass . She has her cloak on , ready to leave . The knock is repeated . &nbsp; SERVANT ( OFF ) Good evening . Yes ? &nbsp; TROYIs Mrs. Troy here ? 217 . INT . THE ENTRANCE . THE STUDY . THE HALL . NIGHT .

We now see TROY , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he steps into the light . BATHSHEBA has come to the door of the study and watches . The dancing has stopped . LABOURERS and GENTRY stand in the doorway of the hall . ( CONTINUED )  --  151  --  TROY takes off his cap and hands it to the SERVANT , looking round with a growing , twisted smile on his lips . Now he turns back his collar and his grinning face shines out at them . BOLDWOOD lurches back . BATHSHEBA stares . TROY begins to laugh , gently , as if at a good bar room joke . BATHSHEBA crouches down , sobbing dryly , her knees to the chin , like a hurt child , knuckles against her teeth . &nbsp; TROYBathsheba , I come here for you . Come home with me now . Come . He holds out his hand to her . &nbsp; TROY ( eyes bulging , in a tremendous voice ) Come , madam , do you hear me ? He glances away for a second and in that second the triumphant malice in his eye is horribly evident . BATHSHEBA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild . She crouches there . &nbsp; BOLDWOODBathsheba , go with your husband . His voice is like a double bass . BATHSHEBA 's P.O.V. : The scene blanched of all colour . TROY 's hand coming towards her . She shrinks back . TROY 's P.O.V. : He reaches her and catches hold of her and jerks her towards him . BATHSHEBA screams . TROY pulls again and then there is a shattering , echoing bang . BATHSHEBA 's P.O.V. again . The blanched effect . Grey smoke , swirling . And then there blooms on TROY 's white shirt ( his cloak is thrown back ) a great and spreading rose of blood . A new and terrible scarlet tunic . BOLDWOOD is beside BATHSHEBA , the gun smoking , its barrel only a foot or two from TROY . Behind BOLDWOOD , in the study , we see the open gun cupboard . TROY stares and gives a great sigh and then crashes , utter dead weight , to the floor , his hand still holds BATHSHEBA 's so that his fall pulls her to him , sprawling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pp. 119-134 &nbsp; pp. 152-157 218 .

She washes round the wound on his chest as gently as if she were trying not to hurt a child . She fondles him and , half crazy , croons a sort of lullaby . 219 . INT . THE LANDING AND STAIRS . NIGHT . LIDDY , with a guttering candle , sits nodding and tearful outside the door . BATHSHEBA 's broken singing in the room . LIDDY wants to help , but can not . TEMPERANCE and SOBERNESS look at her , helpless also . 220 . INT . BATHSHEBA 'S BEDROOM . NIGHT . TROY in a white shroud , lying on the bed . &nbsp; BATHSHEBAHow can I live ? How can I live ? It 's all my fault . How can I live ? She throws herself onto his chest and kisses his cold face . &nbsp; BATHSHEBAFrank ... oh Frank ... 221 . EXT . BOLDWOOD 'S FARM . DAY . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The LABOURERS watch it go and we catch a glimpse of BOLDWOOD , without any emotion on his face , between two top-hatted OFFICERS . The LABOURERS seem to understand his passion and shake their heads sadly . Over this we hear the steady tolling of the church bell . &nbsp; LABOURERPoor gentleman ! I 'd recommend him to mercy , if it was me . We PAN ACROSS the others as they nod agreement . Sound of hammering begins . 222 . CUT 223 . EXT . CASTERBRIDGE PRISON . DAY . The hammering stops and we see the long arm of the gallows rising , as the pole is hoisted , in the prison yard .

We all are - I 'm sure - BOLDWOOD ignores him . &nbsp; GABRIELIs there anything I can get you , sir ? Anything ... The hammering resumes . BOLDWOOD sits . 225 . INT . THE MALTHOUSE . EVENING . The glum faces of the LABOURERS , GABRIEL among them . Time is ebbing away . They consult a variety of timepieces and shake their heads . No reprieve , it seems . 225A . EXT .

CUT 227 . EXT . THE VALE OF WEATHERBURY . DAY . GABRIEL walking along towards the church . It is high summer and the fields are fat with corn . 228 . EXT . THE CHURCHYARD . DAY . GABRIEL opens the gate and goes in . Several other CHORISTERS are going ahead of him and wave to him to join them . He is going too , when he notices a dark FIGURE among the tombstones . BATHSHEBA is standing there looking at the stone . It shows that FRANCIS TROY lies in the same grave as FANNY . BATHSHEBA has been tending the flowers which now show bright blooms to the summer sun . She looks drawn and sad . Tears are drying on her face . GABRIEL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Are you in the choir now ? &nbsp; GABRIELHave been for some months now .

Inside the church , the choir starts singing " Lead , Kindly Light " again , from the top . &nbsp; GABRIELIt 's like this , Mrs. Troy , I may soon have to give up managing the farm , Mrs. Troy . Fact is , I 'm thinking of leaving England . &nbsp; BATHSHEBA ( shaken ) But I thought - I thought - you were to have Mr. Boldwood 's place - I heard - &nbsp; GABRIELI had the offer of it , but I 've refused , you see . I 've a mind to try my luck in California . BATHSHEBA looks horrified . Little TEDDY COGGAN now comes running , running , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door of the church .

Who would I turn to in time of trouble , if you were n't here ? The choir has broken off , but now starts again , more certainly " Lead , Kindly Light ...

You never ask . You must learn to ask . The first drops of rain fall and then it begins to rain harder . BATHSHEBA and GABRIEL smile and open their umbrellas . She takes his arm and they go away from us , under the rain , two dark glistening umbrellas hiding them from us . We PAN past the gravestone where TROY and FANNY are commemorated . Lichens and moss are already beginning to encrust it . It is all in the past . ( CONTINUED )  --  157  --  Pick up BATHSHEBA and GABRIEL now far down by the gate and going out into the lane .

A still photograph of the kind typical of prosperous Victorian country gentry . GABRIEL and BATHSHEBA , in plump middle age , surrounded , in rather formal poses , by their Sunday-best-dressed CHILDREN , of varying ages , one on a Penny Farthing , a GIRL with a tennis racket , etc . The credits begin to roll almost immediately this image appears on the screen . As the credits proceed , the photograph bleeds away slowly to sepia and finally yellows away almost to blank whiteness as the last title appears against the now bleached ghosts of those who lived FAR FROM THE MADDING CROWD .
