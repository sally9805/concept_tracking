As the bloodstained 1960-61 season crawled toward its grave last week , it had proved one thing to everybody 's satisfaction : it was the worst in the 13-year history of U.S. network television . <P> Described by a New York critic as a surrealistic mishmash of " Eliot Ness , Together Ness and Pointless Ness , " the season was one of unhappy comedy and unhealthy violence , of defections , dismissals and dismay . CBS lost its able News Division President Sig Mickelson. and ABC squeezed out veteran Newscaster John Daly . CBS 's Edward R. Murrow took his tobacco habit to Washington as head of the U.S. Information Agency ( see PRESS ) . Writer-Producer ( The Sacco-Vanzetti Story ) Robert Alan Aurthur quit TV with the parting shot : " Television may be unique in our free-enterprise system in that the harder one fights for a position in the marketplace , the poorer the product becomes-all in the name of ' satisfying the mass audience . ' " <P> Drooling Substitutes . One of the massiest satisfiers was ABC 's high-flying The Untouchables , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eliot Ness , a Prohibition era G-man , and specializing in novel ways to kill pretty women . Fortnight ago , the show 's cigarette company sponsor quit when its products were boycotted by sensitive Italian-Americans-but The Untouchables is so hot that ABC had drooling substitute sponsors waiting in line . <P> The celluloid gut-spillers were a rousing commercial success-about the only dramatic success in a season of frightful failure . Producer David Susskind 's tenuous empire was tottering : his Witness was canceled in midseason , his fatuous debate with Nikita Khrushchev drew critical scorn . As Susskind 's hair began to thin and his pockets bulged , his image as TV 's angry young rebel became less convincing , but his influence still pervaded the industry , and his Open End consistently demonstrated that conversation , if intelligent , can be entertaining . Jackie Gleason was miserably miscast as the M.C. of an ill-fated ( one performance ) panel show , You 're in the Picture , and Milton Berle was relegated to narrating Jackpot Bowling . The networks-which billed some 400 shows as " specials " in 1959-60-had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few notable exceptions-such as NBC 's Coming of Christ on Project 20 and the low-key Another Evening with Fred Astaire-most of them were both artistic and commercial flops . <P> Oaters &; Eyes . What about next season ? Well , The Untouchables will be back , along with a host of more or less recognizable imitations : ABC 's Roaring 20s and The Corrupters , NBC 's Cain 's 100 , CBS 's The Defenders . The next season will be the bloodiest ever : of 73 hours of prime evening time , the three networks already have tentatively budgeted 30 to oaters , private eyes and " action-adventure " series ( see chart ) .
