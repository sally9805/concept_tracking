txt London To the sudden visitor London seems one vast blur of fast traffic , new skyscrapers , bulging shopwindows , chains of small restaurants , supermarkets , a few wild haircuts  --  and more fast traffic . The blur is because you 're in a polished black taxi taking the roundabouts and swirls in a fashion that reminds you of traffic in Tokyo and Rome . Swift , free-flowing but more polite ; pedestrians do have a chance in London . If Britain is headed for a balance of payments crisis or devaluation of the pound , it is certainly riding to disaster with a fine flourish and in considerable comfort . An utterly stupendous improvement is noted here over the brave austerity years of 1947-51 , when this correspondent last spent long months in Britain . If Britain has lost an empire it has gained a Commonwealth . West Indians Run the Trains And a lot of members of that Commonwealth are riding the London tubes and underground  --  Pakistanis , Indians . Nigerians , Tanganyikans  --  many as students to British universities . Overseas students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1950 . Those other members of the Commonwealth . the West Indians , are running the buses and subway trains . They , too , have absorbed British politeness and will patiently explain , even to a bumptious American , how to get from Knightsbridge to Kingsway . But this influx of aliens and prosperity has not perceptibly eroded the native character . I spotted a deerstalker 's cap worn with nonchalance by an illustrious gentleman at Waterloo Station , looking for all the world like Sherlock Holmes . The important point was not that he dared affect this headgear but that nobody paid the slightest heed . And how lovely to discover in the classified columns of The Times ( London ) ? under " cats " ? that a " home in the country " is wanted for a certain " enormous black and white . " I once knew one of those sizable grinning felines on Chester Street , straight out of " Alice in Wonderland . " Shopping Hideaways Exist But London tempers all things . Great metal and glass boxes of new buildings have sprung up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to St. Paul 's . Yet the little alleys and shopping hideaways still exist . Supermarkets are thriving and selling just about everything that an American supermarket purveys , but some people still prefer the small greengrocer , the butcher , the local baker . That gauge of modern civilization  --  the women 's hairdressing salon  --  is thriving in Britain . Every typist , it seems , snatches an hour weekly to have her hair " done . " I have n't found as many long hairdos and marcelled curls among the men as the press publicity given this affectation would have suggested . But you occasionally see them , and your immediate impulse is to want to reach for the clippers. // Londontown Revisited // I remember a London that was sprightly with uniforms , and the sirens that wailed , and the buzzbombs that droned overhead . And when the pulsing stopped you wondered what dockside , what chapel , what block of flats was to come down in ruins . But that was long ago and far away . The memories now are enshrined in those volumes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heroic hours of Sir Winston Churchill . Today London is a city in a hurry , but not really in a traffic jam . Thousands of new cars are on the streets , and parked all night , for lack of garages , throughout Kensington and St. Johns Wood and everywhere else . Even beside the subsidized London County Council housing blocks . On summer weekends . I am told , you risk Gargantuan delays in trying to drive in or out of London . But on these winter mornings traffic does move pretty fast . Everybody has a television , everywhere . The rival networks , the BBC and the Independent Television Authority . vie for listeners . Hotels do a thriving business and they no looser . as in 1947 , try to interest you in trying a cutlet of whale meat . The old chops and cutlets and steaks are all back on the menu , long since . For the visiting American , the " fountain ' , at Fortnum and Masons , offers everything from creamy milk shakes to such savorys and sandwiches as " Club @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high , but still one admires Rolls Royces in the streets . This is a land of vigor , of breakthroughs . of imagination But with also pettifogging practices and legal delays that slow things down . What no one knows for certain is how much vision for the future the new government in Whitehall possesses .
