In Rome last week , the controlling interest in Italinvest , a newly organized food-processing and marketing company , passed into unlikely hands . The purchaser : Hawaii 's Castle &; Cooke , Inc. through its pineapple-growing subsidiary , the Dole Corp . Along with the other famed old companies that constitute Hawaii 's Big Five , * Castle &; Cooke was busily transferring as much of its stake as possible away from the land of aloha . <P> Caught by the Century . Founded by Yankee missionaries and traders in the mid-19th century , the Big Five long turned fat profits with their sugar and pineapple plantations , dominated the economic growth of the islands through intermarriages and interlocking directorates . But with World War II , the 20th century overtook the Big Five with some chilling effects . The unshakable grip that the International Longshoremen 's Union won over the islands ' agricultural workers forced wages in the pineapple fields up to an average of $1.78 an hour at the very time when low-wage countries , such as Formosa and Malaya , were invading the pineapple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world pineapple sales fell from 78% in 1952 to 64% in 1960 , and it is still slipping . Similarly , high labor costs restricted Hawaiian sugar sales to the protected U.S. market . <P> To the Big Five 's mounting economic discomfiture was added last year a political threat : the state legislature passed an antitrust bill specially aimed at the Big Five . So far , the state attorney general has filed two antitrust suits involving <P> American Factors ; the Big Five have reacted by beginning to cut down on their interlocking directorships . <P> Better than Death . Not surprisingly , the Big Five , though still continuing to invest in Hawaiian projects , are increasingly looking for new fields abroad . Besides last week 's Italian venture , Castle &; Cooke has over the past six years built up a thriving fish-cannery business in Oregon ; its Bumble Bee canned fish last year accounted for 38% of its $4,600,000 earnings . C. Brewer &; Co. has set up cane plantations and sugar refineries in Ecuador , Puerto Rico and Iran . American Factors is developing 1,400,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pineapples in Honduras . Theo . H. Davies has burgeoning sugar and cement operations in the Philippines , and Alexander &; Baldwin is reportedly dickering to buy a Manila stevedoring company .
