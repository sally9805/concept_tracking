txt The Federal Reserve Board signaled concern over the sluggishness of the economy today by authorizing banks to lend sorril of the money they now hold in reserve . The action will give the banks a $4,600,000,000 increase in potential lending power . The board 's announcement said nothing about the economic situation , but the meaning of its action was clear . It was the first broad policy move announced by the board since the series of steps it took during the recession of 1960-61 to make more credit available to prospective borrowers  --  to ease money by increasing the supply or reducing the interest cost . Gross Product 11p Now , without having taken any announced steps toward tightness in the meantime , the board has eased money again . The economy turned toward recovery 20 months ago . The Commerce Department announced today that total economic activity  --  the gross national product  --  rose to an annual rate of $555,500,000,000 in the quarter ended Sept. 30 . This was a record , but a smaller record than had been expected , and recent reports for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The recovery started off smartly , in March of 1961 . But it has paused four times along the way ? in September last year , in January , in June , and in September again . Measured from the low point , improvement to date has been less than in the three previous recoveries from postwar recessions . Credit Curbs Barred In the previous recoveries the Federal Reserve moved to tighten money as the recovery advanced . This time it has not. ; Today 's action applies specifically to the funds that regular commercial banks hold in reserves against their savings and time deposits . A time deposit is a deposit for a length of time that is specified in advance-30 days , 90 days , and so on . It is a type of deposit used by corporations and other big depositors . The reserve requirement has been 5 per cent for the last eight years . Today 's action reduces it to 4 per cent , effective a week from today for New York , Chicago and other major cities , and two weeks from today for banks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present , and reserves  --  the required 5 per cent  --  are about $3,800,000,000 . A one-point reduction in the reserve require- ment will free $767,000,000 of funds , the board estimated . In the nature of bank operations , this increases their lending potential by six times as much , that is , by some $4,600 , - 000,000 . It does not mean that much will immediately go into the expansion of business , because the banks can only lend what borrowers want to borrow . The multiplication of lending potential is derived from the fact that , when a bank lends money , it does not usually lend the cash on the spot . It credits the borrower with a demand deposit  --  a deposit from which he may draw as he needs . Demand deposits require reserves that average approximately $1 for $7 deposited . Thus , a $1 increase in money available for reserves creates a potential for a loan  --  creation of a deposit ? of $6 . Hodges Foresees Rise By chance , three of the principal economic voices of the Ad. ministration made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : 9 Secretary of Commerce Luther H. Hodges , who issued the report on the gross national product at a news conference , said that he was confident that it would continue upward for the rest of the year . The movement will be " a little slow for a few months , " he said , but business will move ur nicely next year . 9Secretary of the Treasury Douglas Dillon , addressing a meeting of the National Industrial Conference Board in New York , said that business shouk increase its investment in new plant and equipment now , emphasizing the word " now . " Walter W. Heller , chairman of the Council of Economic Ad. visers , said in a Columbia Broadcasting System radio in ? terview that he was sure that a tax cut would be proposed and that it would be substantial . Finds Activity Growing Business activity is gradually catching up with its existing capacity , Mr. Dillon told the in ? dustrial group , so " those whc are waiting for some dazzling upsurge in economic activity before committing investment funds may come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rebut the frequently stated argument that Federal tax cuts should await spending cuts . He said with certainty that the President would propose tax cuts next year , accompanied by reforms that would increase taxes on some things . In another report today , the Department of Commerce said that new orders flowing to manufacturers of durable goods rose by 2 per cent last month while their sales held steady , and that corporate dividend payments through September this year were 61/2 per cent greater than last year . The Federal Reserve ? the central bank , which is not a part of the Administration ? tends to take a more conservative , or less liberal , position on stimulating the economy by government action than do the politicians and their advisers in the Administration . This year , though , the central bankers have indicated concern by what they have not done , that is , by not tightening the credit reins  --  and today by taking overt action . They took a previous overt action when they eased restraints on stock market credit , but that move was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general economic conditions . Today 's move was not so broad and obvious as a cut in the discount rate  --  the rate that the central bank charges on short-term loans to commercial banks  --  would have been . The board noted , however , that balance-of-payments considerations still made it necessary to keep short-term rates from falling . The balance of payments is the relationship of money flowing into and out of the country , and low short-term interest rates induce money to flow out . The board said that today 's release of reserves would assist in meeting the heavy seasonal needs for reserves that the banking system always faces toward the end of the year . The reserve system would normally inject these funds into the banIsing system by buying short-term Government securities , but this would tend to drive short-term rates down , too . The board judged that releasing reserves on savings and time deposit would at least minimize the impact on short-term rates .
