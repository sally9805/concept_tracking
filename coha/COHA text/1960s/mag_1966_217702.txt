El Greco , like nearly every movie biography of a master painter , uses the artist 's art in much the way that a schoolgirl uses paper lace to decorate her valentines . On the heart of this large mushy studio card , dripping with De-Luxe color and local color ( from stunning location sites in Spain ) , is the usual message : Be Mine . Mel Ferrer as the young old master says it to Rosanna Schiaffino as the highborn senorita whose family will not allow her to be his . Rosanna ultimately dies in a convent , post partum and penitent , paying dearly for what began as just another portrait sitting . After a brush with a heretic-hunting cardinal ( Mario Feliciani ) of the Spanish Inquisition , Mel goes quietly to pieces and spends the brief epilogue in an asylum , where demented models presumably inspire his oddly elongated , mystical portraits of the saints . <P> <P> As a short course in art depreciation , El Greco distorts the little that is known of the artist 's life : born Domenikos Theotokopoulos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his young manhood in Venice and Rome , then moved to Toledo , where he died old , honored , contentious , debt-ridden and proud . Though the rest of the drama appears to be based on hysterical inaccuracies , the strain in Spain lies mainly in Actor Ferrer , who portrays the temper of genius with a flatness more appropriate to Toledo , Ohio . Dressed in custom-tailored smocks and tunics , Mel looks like nothing so much as a paid escort en route to the Beaux-Arts Ball .
