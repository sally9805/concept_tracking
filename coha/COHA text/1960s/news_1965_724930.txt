txt An election about to happen often speaks louder than a court decision that already has . Take Virginia . Its supreme court last January held , as many other courts in many other states have , that the political boundaries were unequal and needed rearranging . It also ruled that its 10 members of the House must be elected at large in 1966 if the state is n't reapportioned before then . Nothing has happened since . But now a state election is just around the corner . And the 10 congressmen are worried that if the redistricting is n't done before then , legal problems might follow . And that might make running at large inevitable . They pressured the Governor to convene a special session of the Legislature before the November election . He finally agreed . So the legislators will meet Aug. 31 . Walt Disney , that boon to children of all ages , once upon a time put up Disneyland . And it lived so happily ever after that now Comedian Bob Hope wants one . Mr. Hope says he aims to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 16,000 acres in Simi Valley north of Los Angeles once called Corriganville . Almost everybody has seen Corriganville in the movies . Thousands of western flicks have been shot there . It will now be known as Hopetown . " It 'll be southern California 's answer to Mt . Rushmore , " says Mr. Hope , who is not only funny , but rich . Its chief feature will be stone faces , the 10:enesses of celebrated western movie stars  --  Tom Mix , for instance  --  sculptured out of huge boulders lying around the place . To think it was n't long ago that " Indians " used to crouch behind those very boulders waiting in ambush for John Wayne ! Trends ... Water suddenly is whetting concern all around . States on the Eastern Seaboard are coping with a four-year drought . In Washington this month a House committee will take up Arizona 's Central Valley Project . Out in Oregon , Western water experts meet two days this week ( Aug. 5 and 6 ) to mull the perennial water needs of the American West . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water-basin planning on a regional scale . And some in Washington are even plugging for water planning that is national rather than just regional in scope . Many of these concerns are new . Up to now the West , which has been known to war over water , has been the main seeker of federal water funds . Suddenly everybody is starting to want help . What is emerging ? and it 's new ? is a search for a national water policy . How and why ... What happens when a policeman off duty wants to abet the very causes which on duty he is supposed to try to control ? In Los Angeles one policeman who did just got suspended from the force . Patrolman Michael B. Hannon on his off-duty hours took to marching in civil-:rights demonstrations and championing various militant causes . A Los Angeles police department trial board urged that he be dismissed for " conduct unbecoming an officer . " Police Chief William H. Parker reduced the sentence to suspension for six months for " crusading against law enforcement . " Now the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Liberties Union . Its outcome will probably set some precedents for policemen in general . es Still another precedent setter seems headed now for the Supreme Court of the United States . It bears on libel laws . And it has to do with Wally Butts versus the Saturday Evening Post . The magazine in 1963 published a story charging that Mr. Butts , the University of Georgia football coach , had passed team secrets to the rival University of Alabama coach . Mr. Butts won $460,000 in damages . An appeals court later upheld the award . But last year the Supreme Court reversed a. half-million-dollar award in a case brought against the New York Times by a Montgomery , Ala. , police commissioner . The court ruled that mere error in a comment on a public official 's activities is not cause for libel action . Actual malice and disregard for truth must be proved . The question now seems to be : What 's a public official ? Is Mr. Butts one ? That 's what the high court may be asked to define .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
