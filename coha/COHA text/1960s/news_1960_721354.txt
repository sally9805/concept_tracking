txt A customary roosting place for ' platitudes is in the foreign affairs planks of our party platforms , where , couched in the homely vernacular of politics , happy generalizations are handed to the voters . However , thanks to the efforts of Senator John Sherman Cooper ( Republican of Kentucky ) , who has been charged with preparing the Republican diplomatic program , this will almost certainly contain two nuggets of truth . The first concerns international freedom of space and the definition of territorial air rights ; in other words , posing the question of where national air ends and international space begins . This vital matter has not yet been settled for the simple reason that it never has been raised . The second concerns the difficulty of thwarting novel Soviet methods of subversion . These methods now found subversion on a blackmail threat to bombard with rockets lands which themselves seek to protect new nations now finding their way to independence . Shortly after last May 's summit conference collapsed , Marshal Malinovsky propounded a revolutionary Soviet doctrine which has since been both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another country sends aircraft over a " Socialist " state , the Soviet Union reserves the right to launch missiles against the base from which such planes took off . Malinovsky 's doctrine is based on ideology rather than geography . It assumes for Moscow the right to determine when a Government is " Socialist " and when it should be " protected " by these incredibly dangerous means . Originally , its implications were linked to our own U-2 overflights and were aimed at our bases in such lands as Turkey , Pakistan , Norway and Japan . However , since no one protested the idea with sufficient vigor before the United Nations or elsewhere , the Kremlin has pushed it to its logical conclusion . It issued a warning that the United States would be rocketed if we " interfered " against Castro . ' Soviets Suiting Themselves Since Malinovsky first iterated his doctrine , Khrushchev has been perverting it to suit his purposes . He warned Austria that Russia would consider its neutrality had been violated , were NATO rockets ever launched over Austrian territory , at no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act against Austria . Contradictorily , he claimed Soviet rockets cou 'd be directed against any land " interfering " in Cuba . Presumably these would not violate the air space of nations in between . ? Khrushchev has so far been permitted to pontificate in a legal noman 's land because there is no international agreement on the extent of territorial air space or freedom of the reaches above it . Thus , although Moscow was furious when our U-2 's flew over the Soviet Union , it never complained about American satellites whirling higher up over precisely the same area ; and Moscow sends its own satellites across other nations . Our Government , although it has studied these problems since 1957 , has not yet even formulated its own position or seriously consulted other nations . This lack was pointed out to Cooper by a nonpolitical friend on July 18 .

This evening , after discussion with representatives of the State Department , it was agreed to include these points subject to almost certain approval by the platform committee tomorrow morning . There is no easy solution to revoutionary diplomatic puzzles made possible by the advance in scientific technology . But in each case  --  the question of defining territorial air Doundaries and outer space or meetng the threat of subversion by nenace of rocketry  --  the Republimns would have us place the matter pefore the United Nations . This will not be an answer to a question , or series of questions , al ? eady grave and bound to become till graver . Nevertheless , it is the ) eginning of an answer . At last , the ssue is starting to be recognized and aced . And this is a fundamental question of the Nineteen Sixties . It s rare that political platforms do nore than make promises to better he past  --  instead of tackling the cal problems of the future .               @ @ @ @ @ @
