Once again the U.S. braced to hurl Marine Lieut . Colonel John Glenn into orbit about the earth-and once again the flight was canceled . <P> This time the trouble was traced to a layer of insulation in the Atlas-D 's giant fuel tank ( 65 ft. high ; 10 ft. in diameter ) . The insulation had somehow absorbed some kerosene-like fuel , which is mixed with liquid oxygen when the missile is fired . Engineers set about correcting the fault , and space scientists got ready to start the complex preflight tests all over again . Scheduled date for the next try : Feb. 13.
