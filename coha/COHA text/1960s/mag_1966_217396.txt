For more than half a century , Horn and Hardart 's Automats have been a Manhattan fixture . Into the coin slot drop the nickels , dimes and quarters , up flicks the lid of the traditional , post-office-style food box , and out comes everything from sandwiches to cinnamon buns and applesauce cake . Last week the automat moved outside . <P> <P> The new Windomat , with boxes facing directly on the sidewalk , is meant for rushed secretaries , who can take their food back to the office , or hurried tourists , who tend , to eat while standing . Sandwiches come wrapped in Cellutex , hot drinks and soup in paper containers . Horn and Hardart expects soon to have them all over town .
