It is like no other building in New York . Huge , cantilevered stories jut outward rather than recede , as in most commercial buildings . The ground floor is cut off from the street by a sunken sculpture garden , already dubbed " the Moat , " spanned by a partially canopied bridge . As last week 's opening-night throng of 4,000 quickly discovered , such architectural novelty has certain distinct advantages . Arriving in the pelting rain , the guests had no sooner ducked under the stone canopy than they discovered that the bridge ahead of them ( see opposite ) was bone dry , sheltered by the towering , projecting museum wings overhead . While still outside , they were already protected and being beckoned within . <P> <P> It was the first , but only one of the many surprises tucked behind the granite-sheathed fagade of Manhattan 's new Whitney Museum of American Art . Even in a time that has seen museum design change from the Roman palazzos favored by turn-of-the-century architects to the spiraling extravaganza of Frank Lloyd Wright 's Guggenheim , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Houston 's Museum of Fine Arts , the $6,000,000 Whitney , designed by Marcel Breuer and Hamilton Smith , was the event and talk of the evening . <P> Jungle Identity . Not that the exhibition within- " Art of the United States : 1670-1966 " - was overlooked . It hardly could be , for rarely , if ever , has a better survey of American art been assembled under one roof . But what won over the first nighters was Breuer 's dramatic exterior combined with spacious , almost handcrafted interiors , including white canvas and plywood walls , split bluestone floors , and precast concrete grid ceilings , that seemed to recede impassively behind the art works on display . <P> Thus the museum is two different experiences : monumental on the outside and functional , well-lighted and roomy on the inside . This is precisely what Architect Breuer had hoped for . " A museum in Manhattan , " he said , " should not look like a business or office building . Its form and material should have identity and weight in the dynamic jungle of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem began when he was handed a small corner plot only 104 ft. by 125 ft . To create within five stories a total floor space seven times as great as the site , he proceeded much like a Sardinian baker , who , with every piece of dough he subtracts , adds it back some place else in the loaf . Thus to compensate for space lost by the indoor-outdoor sculpture garden and the host of first-floor functional requirements , from coat racks and publications desk to unloading platforms , Breuer designed cantilevered upper floors to produce progressively larger galleries culminating in a lofty , sky-lit top gallery . <P> Realizing that a glass faade would only allow the polyglot architecture of Madison Avenue to intrude , Breuer walled off his neighbors with concrete blinders and nearly solid walls . Controlled ventilation and artificial light may make windows obsolete , but lack of them has the drawback of inducing claustrophobia . To allow " visual contact with the outside , " he added seven trapezoidal windows , including the largest on the front facade , which acts as both a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
