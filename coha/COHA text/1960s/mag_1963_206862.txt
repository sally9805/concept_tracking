It was Victory Day in Port Said , six years exactly since the last British soldier left Suez . There to celebrate the occasion was Egypt 's President Gamal Abdel Nasser . As 20,000 Egyptians cheered , Nasser called the British-from Queen to commoner- " sons of bitches , " sneered at his critics , and ridiculed as a pair of " nuts " Jordan 's King Hussein and Saudi Arabia 's King Saud because they oppose Egypt 's military venture in Yemen , where Nasser supports the rebel Abdullah Sallal . <P> " Brothers ! " cried Nasser . " This is not the Yemeni people 's battle . It is our battle , because the more people we can win over from imperialism and reaction , the more our power is increased . Revolution will soon triumph everywhere against reaction ! " Nasser promised that Israel 's turn would come as soon as " we get rid of Saud and Hussein , who conspire with Zionism and imperialism to preserve their own thrones and fortunes . " <P> Nasser proudly watched a parade of Egyptian might-60 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tactical rockets , and dismissed reports that more than 10,000 Egyptians had been lost in the Yemen campaign , insisted that the actual number of Egyptian dead was only 136 . <P> Washington was wrong if it thought that Nasser would withdraw Egyptian forces and leave the area in peace in exchange for U.S. diplomatic recognition of Yemen 's revolutionary regime . Instead , Nasser made it clear at Port Said that he plans to stay in Yemen , the better to export revolution into the British-protected states-ranging from Kuwait in the north of the Arabian peninsula to Aden in the south-as well as to Syria , Jordan and Saudi Arabia .
