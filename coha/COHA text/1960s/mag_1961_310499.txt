After a delay of two months , the quarrelsome nuclear-test-ban talks were scheduled to resume in Geneva this week . In response to a U.S.-British invitation , the Soviet Union last week agreed to pick up the discussions where they left off at the end of the 340th session . <P> Although the Soviet Union warned that it would resume its own atomic explosions if the West were to carry out any tests during the talks , the U.S. made it clear that it would not agree to any uninspected test moratorium until agreement was reached . Said the State Department : " The U.S. will continue to take such actions as it deems necessary to safeguard its national security until a controlled test-ban agreement is achieved . " Thus , the Atomic Energy Commission will go ahead with the fifth in its current series of underground blasts , scheduled for Dec. 10.
