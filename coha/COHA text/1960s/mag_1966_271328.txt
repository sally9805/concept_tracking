By buying mutual funds , 3,500,000 Americans have spread their investments over scores of stocks-and the average customer has seen his initial stake grow more than 100% in the past decade . Last week , after eight years of probing and parrying , the Securities and Exchange Commission declared that the funds charge too much for too little . While concluding that the funds are " a sound and useful investment medium , " the SEC advocated tough new laws to control them . In doing so , Chairman Manuel F. Cohen 's activist commission bid to expand its own power , and set off what will surely be a bruising battle in Congress over an industry whose assets top $33 billion . <P> " Unwarranted . " The most important and explosive recommendation in the 346-page report was that the funds ' sales charges to customers be knocked down by act of Congress from an " excessive " average of 9.3% to 5% . Commissions on a $4,000 order of mutual funds , for example , now run about nine times as high as on a $4,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gap " unwarranted . " As one way to narrow it , the SEC suggested that the funds bring down the fees paid to the management companies that advise and usually control them . Such fees generally run to .5% of the funds ' assets , far more than the .04% to .18% paid to advisers of bank investment funds and the .06% to .07% that goes to managers of pension plans . These charges take up to 40% of the fund shareholders ' dividend income , multiply into enormous profit margins for the fund-management companies ( see box ) and huge salaries and bonuses for their bosses . Last year , for example , the Massachusetts Investors Trust group paid $621,922 to its chief executive , Kenneth L. Isaacs , and well over $450,000 to each of three other executives . <P> Recommending a move that would come close to Government control of salaries , the SEC urged that Congress amend the Investment Company Act of 1940 so as to limit payments to fund managers to " reasonable " levels . Then , if the SEC or individual fund shareholders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the courts . There the controversy would be decided by such factors as the nature of the services that the managers provided and the fees paid to bank trust-fund managers and other comparable executives . <P> " Give-Ups " Plus " Churning . " Beyond that , the SEC wants to reduce commissions by forcing stock exchanges to reduce the brokerage fees on large transactions-that is , to give the funds " volume discounts . " One complication is that the funds often use brokerage fees as rewards for brokers who supply investment research or push sales of the fund shares . Fund managers frequently tell brokers handling big block trades to distribute up to 60% of their fees to other brokers . The SEC argued that such " give-ups " create pressures for " churning " - meaning that fee-splitting can lead to trading simply to generate brokerage commissions for the friends of funds . Thus the SEC wants to do away with almost all " give-ups. "
