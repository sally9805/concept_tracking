txt etters to The Times ; . 26 Letters to The Times Moses Defends Ocean Road Program forBoulevard on Fire Island Is Upheld To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : My attention has been called to Theodore H. White 's generally temperate , wistful and nostalgic letter about Fire Island published June 11 . Mr. White is a good citizen and writer , and has some claim to acquaintance with a part of the continuous barrier beach system , a system which extends from the west end of Staten Island to Montauk Point . This subject has been carefully considered by a representative State Commission which has enlisted the advice of acknowledged experts in the field , and will issue a definitive report after an early public hearing . Since Mr. White has singled me out , I would call the attention of his readers to the following gaps and errors in his testimony : The Army Engineers recommend hydraulic fill through this twentymile stretch at an elevation eighteen feet above mean high water . So do we . In this instance , the Army engineers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they did not concern themselves with a highway on top of the fill . This is properly a matter for the state and Federal highway authorities . It is proposed that the hydraulic fill be topped by a controlled , protected and restricted ocean boulevard built by the state with Federal aid . Cost of Project The cost , including underpasses , landscaping , etc. , would be about half the $19,000,000 mentioned by Mr. White . The total cost of the Federal project for the entire South Shore study , estimated by the Army at $51,000,000 for 34,000,000 yards of hydraulic fill , jetties and inlet stabilization , would be increased to $62,000,000 to cover the added cost of an ocean boulevard . There is no conceivable excuse for a high fill without pavement to provide access to a theoretically , remote , inaccessible barrier , littoral or reef for the exclusive enjoyment of a few aficionados . An ocean boulevard on Fire Island , properly landscaped and protected and accessible only at infrequent intervals , is no more a menace to beauty than the ocean boulevard on Jones Beach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty-three years . We have five miles of additional state park at the westerly end of Fire Island to be dedicated when the new bridge from Jones Beach opens in 1964 . Moreover , between this new park and Smith Point County Park there will be an additional public park east of Davis Park . These are for transients . Apparently Mr. White is talking about the twenty miles between Fire Island State Park and Smith Point County Park . Is he advocating acquisition of this area for public purposes or for commercial real estate subdivision ? He ca n't have it both ways . Easy Access The stretch in question would be properly zoned and no more offensive from the point of view of sub-division than Saltaire , Point O'Woods or other present villages . Why should n't there be more summer cottages on Fire Island , and why should n't husbands get home every night instead of only at weekends , and why should n't there be ready access available when a child is sick or when a hurricane is brewing ? Does Mr. White live in a dune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the local governments . Man can not live by bread alone nor can he live without bread . Therein lies the difference between foresight joined with common sense on the one hand and noble gestures and sentiment on the other . The population of the south side of Suffolk County is increasing so rapidly that a twenty-mile barrier beach accessible Only by boat and on foot would be a serious police problem and a public menace rather than a benefit . Has Mr. White ever tried policing beaches under increasing pressure of hundreds of thousands of summer vacationists ? If Mr. White wants ocean-front solitude  --  and who can blame him for that ? ? he will have to go farther from metropolitan complexes like New York . Meanwhile , we can promise him at Fire Island almost absolute immunity from intrusion at least seven months in the year , substantial immunity for another two months and comparative quiet for the remaining three months . All of the New York barrier reefs on the Atlantic were largely inaccessible town lands subject to periodic inundation . Jones Beach was preserved by our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attacks as Mr. White 's , which , by the way , reads exactly like the arguments which defeated the original Jones Beach town propositions . We successfully reconciled state and town parks and cottage usage on Jones Beach , but we got no help from the critics in the process . The very people who now advocate locking up Fire Island should go back to the days when the Regional Plan wanted Jones Beach sold for subdivision and Governor Smith was petitioned to remove the Long Island State Park Commissioners because of their far-sighted program .

South Africa 's Races Ambassador 's Facts Disputed on Presence of Black Man TO THE EDITOR 0#THE NEW YORK TIMES : I have been impressed with your newspaper 's coverage of the recent events in the Republic of South Africa and awaited with interest the response of the defenders of that troubled land . When finally a letter did appear June 7 I was not only disappointed by the inability of Ambassador Naude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was shocked by his inaccurate historiography in justifying the dominant position of the Europeans in South Africa . It is a complete fallacy to state that " no black man had ever set foot in most of what is today South Africa when the man of Europe brought civilization . . . . " Had the Ambassador been following the work of anthropologists and historians On South Africa , he would have realized that today there is a great deal of evidence that the Bantuspeaking peoples occupied most of . the eastern and better-watered half of the present Republic of South Africa long before white men settled there . Of course , the Afrikaaners do admit that Hottentots met the Portuguese and later on Van Riebeck when they arrived at the cape in the fifteenth , sixteenth and seventeenth centuries . However , for the purposes of their ideology they do not consider the copper-colored Hottentots black men . . Early Population In a recent article published in African Studies ( Volume 18 , Number 4 , 1959-60 ) , Professor Monica Wilson of the Department of Anthropology at the University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1554 the area *south of the Umtata River ( 32 ? S. Lat. ) was thickly populated with cattle-keeping people " very black in color . " Evidence from 1593 attests to the fact that these people spoke an Nguni language . From 1686 also comes evidence that Xhosa-speaking people were already at the southeastern tip of South Africa . Furthermore , the genealogies of all of these populations record no major movements after 1300 . In the nineteenth century Anthony Trollope said , " South Africa is a black man 's country ; it was so ; it is so ; and it will always be so . " Modern black South Africans would amend this to add that the white man came to South Africa , and he can remain on a basis of equality , but not if he intends to maintain baaskap Afrikaaner superiority over the blacks . ELLIOTT P. SKINNER , Associate Professor of Anthropology , New York University . New . York , June 11 , 1962 . The Military in Space To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : . The proposed military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insanity . In the name of American strength and security our Government is prepared to initiate , without definite provocation , a cosmic nuclear arms competition which will constitute an immediate and long-range threat to peace . President Kennedy talks of disarmament and of our purely peaceful intentions in space research and travel yet has the temerity to set the United States up as the first military power in space and expect the world to be grateful . ARNOLD LIEBER , M. D. Glen Oaks , N. Y. June 11 , 1962 . Speed of Buses Questioned To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The tragic accident on June 11 on the New Jersey Turnpike points up a question that has puzzled many of us for a long time . Why are bus drivel 's permitted by their employers and by the State Police regularly to exceed the posted speed limits by ten or fifteen miles an hour ? I suppose it is to enable them to meet the time schedules required of them . GEORGE C , MILES , New York , June 12 , 1962. .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
