MIDDLE EAST <P> The Egyptian artillerymen waited until the sun was low over the Suez Canal and shining in the eyes of Israeli gunners on the occupied east bank . Then , along the 70-mile front , they opened up with a sustained barrage , promptly answered in kind by the Israelis . At a time when a settlement in the Middle East is much on the minds of the leaders of the U.S. , Russia and Western Europe , last week 's sudden flare-up of violence seemed even more than usually to fit Clausewitz 's definition of war as " continuation of diplomacy by other means . " It was equally ominous that for four days Arabs and Israelis were once again doing battle in the heaviest exchange of artillery fire since their 1967 war . <P> Blackout in Cairo . The Egyptians have an estimated five divisions and 1,000 guns along the canal . The Israelis have roughly one division and crews to man perhaps a third as many guns , which they move frequently to deprive the Egyptians of fixed targets . An estimated 40,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marked improvement in Egyptian gunnery since the last major exchange in October , casualties on both sides were relatively light . The Israelis put their own losses at five soldiers killed , 26 wounded , two vehicles destroyed , and a Piper Cub downed by a Soviet-made SA-2 missile . The Egyptians admitted to four soldiers killed , 39 wounded and 72 civilian casualties , as well as extensive damage to 14 oil tanks at the Suez and Nasr refineries . <P> By far the heaviest blow to Egypt , though , was the loss of its " golden soldier " and Chief of Staff , Lieut . General Abdel Monem Riad , the most highly regarded officer in any Arab country . Artilleryman Riad had flown to Ismailia for a firsthand look at the shelling , when he was struck by what the Israelis termed a " lucky " direct hit . Perhaps as a mark of soldierly respect , the guns along the Suez were silent for Riad 's funeral next day . Egypt 's President Gamal Abdel Nasser led a parade of more than 100,000 mourners through Cairo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to the canal ! " <P> Fitting the militant mood , Cairo was a city preparing for war . The government is gradually extending a blackout of neon signs , house lights and auto headlights . Since blackouts are tactically obsolete in an age of electronic detection instruments , the objective seemed to be to bring home to Cairenes the possibility that they might be bombed . All Nile bridges , train stations , telegraph offices and key installations are protected by guards in sandbagged redoubts . Brick blast walls have been built in front of thousands of doorways . MIG-21s make practice scrambles over the city and on the ground are protected by concrete revetments against a surprise attack like the one that wiped out Egypt 's air force at the start of the Six-Day War . <P> Barlev Line . " There is no enthusiasm for the preparations , " reports TIME Correspondent Lee Griggs , " but rather resignation . Egyptians are sadly reconciled to another round , simply because it somehow seems inevitable , and even at the cost of another ' setback . ' They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established that might cost them Sinai as the price of a permanent settlement . " Declared a government spokesman : the Israelis " are arming our territory against us.
