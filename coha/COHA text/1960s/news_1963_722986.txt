txt The United States is thinking about a control council or " directorate " of four countries for a multilateral nuclear fleet it is discussing with its allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization . Besides the United States the council would consist of West Germany , Britain and Italy , reliable sources reported today . A place would be left open for possible French participation in the event that Paris comes around to supporting the plan . A council of four countries apparently is being considered in the expectation , or perhaps hope , that a minimum of six , and possibly seven , of the allies will go along with the United States proposals for a 25-ship 200-missile surface fleet . With West Germany 's acceptance in principle of the plan , the United States delegation discussing it with the allies is reported to believe that there is a better than 50-50 chance of getting the plan out of the blueprint and into the construction phase . The delegation , headed by Livingston T. Merchant , President Kennedy 's special envoy , and Thomas K. Finletter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , considerably buoyed by West Germany 's support and its apparent willingness to match the United States ' 35 to 40 per cent ' share Of the estimated *500,000,000 cost over 10 years . SO far as . the United States is concerned , West Germany 's support is a vital element for the success of the plan . What some American officials call the " comino effect " now is expected to operate . That is to say that , with Wed Germany in , Italy would feel that it was , impossible to stay out and this in turn would bring in Belgium and the Netherlands . The talks with British officials will be held Tuesday and Wednesday . Britain is committed to the Idea of a multilateral nuclear force , which was written into the Nassau agreement by Prime Minister Macmillan in December , but not necessarily to the proposals now advanced by the United- States . It was under the Nassau pact that Britain obtained United States agreement to supply her with Polaris missiles for a British-built nuclear submarine fleet . Though cheered by the discussions in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confident that the plan will mature . The mission is reported to feel that the- Bonn talks have created a more favorable atmosphere than existed previously , but that there is still a considerable distance to go before a treaty can be written . There is a strong feeling , however , that if the mission did not have to interrupt its round of consultations because of the Italian elections , the momentum built up would carry the preliminary talks to a successful conclusion . It is feared that between the talks with the British and the Italian " elections on " " April t ? , many new doubts . and hesitations will spring up among the Europeans . In that event , according toreliable sources , the United- - States would not , push its plan and would let the Europeans try to formulate their own proposals . This was hinted at by President Kennedy. : last week .

In any event , ' the sources here said , the United States was not prepared to pay any price to have its proposals accepted ; For ? the moment , at least , this apparently means that- the United States is not prepared to renounce the veto over the use a the NATO force 's nuclear weapons , nor is-it prepared to switch ' back to Polaris submarines . rather than advocating the use of surface ships for the contem- ? plated fleet .
