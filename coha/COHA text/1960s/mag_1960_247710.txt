What is the U.S. doing to help captured U-2 Pilot Francis Gary Powers ? Like any other U.S. citizen in trouble in a foreign country , he is entitled to all the help his Government can give him-but as of this week , that has been very little . The State Department has made four attempts . On May 6 , the day Khrushchev announced that a U.S. plane had been shot down . the U.S. embassy in Moscow delivered to the Soviet Foreign Ministry a note asking for details about both plane and pilot . No answer . On May 10 , after Khrushchev announced that Powers was alive , another note asked permission to see him . Again no answer . Twice since then , the U.S. embassy has renewed the U.S. request to see Powers . Still no answer . <P> <P> Whatever happens to Powers in Russia , the story of what happened to him over Russia is gradually coming clear . Competent U.S. observers are now convinced that he was not shot down by rocket fire at all . Backing up its case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Gorky Park , the current Aviation Week argues persuasively that Pilot Powers must have " made a controlled emergency landing . " <P> Backing down , the Russians have revised their original claim that the plane was hit and destroyed by a high-altitude rocket . Now the party line , as told to Gorky Park visitors , is that the rocket scored a near miss , that the damaged plane began to " disintegrate " as it fell . But in revising the original lie . the Russians bumbled into another one . To explain why the crash did not shatter the plane into small fragments , they said that the U-2 was largely built of unusually lightweight metal ( i.e. , titanium ) , and therefore did not fall so very hard . Fact : the U2 's frame was not built of titanium , but of ordinary aircraft-grade Duralumin.
