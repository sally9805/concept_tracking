( See Cover ) <P> Triumphant music blared across the land . Russia 's radios saluted the morning with the slow , stirring beat of the patriotic song , How Spacious Is My Country . Then came the simple announcement that shattered forever man 's ancient isolation on earth : " The world 's first spaceship , Vostok East , with a man on board , has been launched on April 12 in the Soviet Union on a round-the-world orbit . " <P> From Leningrad to Petropavlovsk , the U.S.S.R. came to a halt . Streetcars and buses stopped so that passengers could listen to loudspeakers in public squares . Factory workers shut off their machines ; shopgirls quit their counters . Schoolkids turned eagerly from the day 's lessons . Somewhere above them , a Soviet citizen was arcing past the stars , whirling about the earth at 18,000 miles an hour , soaring into history as the first man in space . <P> Radio reports identified the " cosmonaut " as Major Yuri Alekseevich Gagarin , 27 . According to the official announcement , the Vostok @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9:07 a.m. , Moscow time . Brief bulletins , from time to time , traced its orbital track . Word came that at 9:22 a.m . Gagarin had reported by radio from a point over <P> South America : " The flight is proceeding normally . I feel well . " At 10:15 he checked in over Africa : " The flight is normal . I am withstanding well the state of weightlessness . " At 11:10 a report was broadcast that at 10:25 Gagarin had completed one circuit of the earth and that the spaceship 's braking rocket had been fired . This was the perilous point when the Vostok , its nose white-hot from friction with the earth 's atmosphere , began its plunge to a landing . All Russia waited nervously-and the government-controlled radio milked every moment for suspense . Not until 12:25 was the proud announcement put on the air : " At 10:55 Cosmonaut Gagarin safely returned to the sacred soil of our motherland . " <P> <P> Hats were heaved aloft . Russians cheered , hugged each other , telephoned their friends . The celebration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streets to clusters of huts on the lonely steppes . Newspapers blossomed with bright red headlines . Everywhere people paraded with banners hailing the Soviet leap into space . Not even for Sputnik 1 had the U.S.S.R. worked up such effervescent enthusiasm . <P> Never the Same . The extravagance was understandable . Yuri Gagarin had flown higher ( 188 miles ) and faster ( 18,000 m.p.h. ) than any other man ever before ; yet even such startling statistics shrank into insignificance before the infinite implications of his trip . Suddenly man 's centuries-old dream of space travel had been transformed into reality .
