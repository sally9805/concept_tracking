txt MONTEGO BAY , Jamaica , Feb. ** Rose , the showman who made a fortune out of extravaganza , beautiful girls and the stock market , died at 2:15 A.M. today of lobar pneumonia at the Eldmire Nursing Home in Montego Bay . He was 66 years old . ' . Mr. Rose had come to Montego Bay , where he maintained a winter home , to recuperate from cardio-vascular surgery performed in Houston , in December . After surgery , Mr. Rose ? impresario , theatrical Foducer , newspaper columnist , nightclub owner and writer of such songs as " That Old Gang of Mine , " " Without a Song " and " Me and My Shadow " ? returned to his New York home on Dec. 22 . He flew to Montego Bay Tuesday with his Sister , Polly Gott // lieb , wife of Alex Gottlieb , Hollywood producer and writer . Doctors had prescribed a sixweek rest . Mr. Gottlieb said in Beverly Hills , that his wife had called him and said Mr. Rose had caught a slight cold two days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to accompany the body today to New York , where a funeral Service will be held on Sunday at 2 P.M. at the Billy Rose Theater , 208 West 41st Street . Surviving besides Mrs. Gottlieb is another sister , Mrs. Miriam Stern of New York City . Success in Several Fields In his scramble from Manhattan slum dweller to multimillionaire patron of the arts , Billy Rose built several careers . He was a champion shorthand writer , top-rated writer of popular songs , owner of nightclubs , producer of Broadway shows and large investor in stocks and real estate . He also was married five times , twice to the same woman , Joyce Mathews , an actress  --  and he was quoted by a Broadway columnist in December as saying that he and Miss Mathews planned to marry again , in Rome . " Rome , " Mr. Rose said , " because most marriages that take place there seem to last . " So varied were the phases of his life that many who knew of him in recent years only as the biggest holder of stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a million dollars worth of sculpture to Israel did not know that as the author of lyrics for nearly 400 songs , including 50 hits , he ranked AA in the American Society of Composers , Authors and Publishers ( ASCAP ) rating , the position held by Irving Berlin and Richard Rodgers . His songs included " Barney Google , " " Rainbow ' Round My Shoulder , " " Would You Like to Take a Walk , " " More Than You , Know , " " It 's Only a Paper ' Moon , " " I Found a Million Dollar Baby in a Five and Ten Cent Store " and " Without a Song , " his favorite . Behind a fortune estimated ' at upwards of $25-million was a life in which he pioneered in creating entertainment for people of moderate income His successful nightclubs , among them the Casino de Paree , Billy Rose 's Music Hall and the Diamond Horseshoe , were based on this approach . Musicals Were Hits And he earned his first million with his Aquacade , the biggest attraction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which often grossed more than $100,000 a week . In the theater , however , though he began with a similar approach to mass appeal with musicals , the most famous of which were " Jumbo " and " Carmen Jones , " he also produced such serious efforts as " Clash by Night , " " The Immoralist " and " The Wall . " As the successes of the 5 foot , 3-inch , fast-talking showman multiplied , he became , inevitably , the subject of considerable publicity , much of which he generated himself . Thus he encouraged Richard Maney , the Broadway press agent , to describe him as a Basement Beliasco , Bantam Barnum , Mighty Midget , Egregious Effendi , Mad Mahout and Small Svengali . Sometimes , partly from honest self-appraisal and partly from a sense of publicity value , he deprecated himself . Once he said of his career in show business , " I sell ballyhoo , not genius . " ' Or when a multimillionaire was pouring money into " Jumbo , " he remarked that the show " will either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach , he once remarked : " We key our shows to outshout and outclatter the customer , " and , " if the wells are red there 's a good chance the ink in your ledger wo n't be . " One day , when asked by Maurice Zolotow , writing a series about him for the Saturday Evening Post , to discuss his song-v : riting career , he replied : " Now get this ? I had no particular desire to write music , but I saw no reason why I , with a little preparation and work , could not join the gold rush . " By the time Mr. Rose had reached the security of an eight-digit fortune , he had become one of the most controversial figures in show business with at least two schools of thought on almost everything he did . There were those who lauded his boyhood labors to support a family . Others sneered at his trick as a schoolboy sprinter in getting off before the starting gun . Praise for his philanthropy was countered with thrusts about the publicity that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combination of vaudeville , sex and popular songs , were cited as examples of his vulgarity . And when " Jumbo , " despite attendance of about a million did not make a profit , George S. Kaufman said of Mr. Rose : " Failure has gone to his head . " Eventually theories were developed to try to explain Mr. Rose 's furious drive for success . Some said it was his height ? for a long time he used artificial heels that added more than two inches to his stature . One theory offered in the nineteen thirties in The New Yorker by Alva Johnston was that Mr Rose 's claustrophobia goaded him into buying ever-larger apartments and homes . Eventually , his wealth , love of luxury and strong individuality made some people think him somewhat eccentric . Several years ago , when his country residence in Mount Kisco was destroyed by fire , he bought Tavern Island , in Long Island Sound , and stocked it with peacocks and deer . This island home symbolized the distance Mr. Rose had traveled since his birth as William Samuel Rosenberg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sept. 6 , 1899 . As a small boy in that tough area , his natural aggressiveness and sharp tongue encouraged bigger boys to bully him . At the High School of Commerce he showed an amazing flair for Gregg shorthand and attracted the attention of John Robert Gregg , who was on the lookout for boys to train for service in the rivalry between the Gregg and Pitman systems . Mr. Gregg wanted his boys to beat the best of the Pitman professionals in " world 's championships . " He took young Billy under his wing and put him through a strenuous training program . Three men often dictated to him in relays of increasing speeds . Finally , the dictators broke under the strain , and a special phonograph was built by the Victor Company that fired words at him as fast as 350 a minute . Two days before one championship match , Billy broke the first finger of his right hand while skating in Central Park . It was impossible for him to close the finger on a pen ; but he stuck the pen through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won another victory for Gregg . The shorthand proved to be one of his most important assets . This expertise got him a job during World War I taking dictation from Bernard M. Baruch , who was then head of the War Industries Board . He also took notes at conferences between Mr. Baruch and im portant industrialists . In later years Mr. Baruch was to be come an important adviser to him on investments . During this phase of his life , the young man developed an intense admiration for tycoons that he never lost . It was the first time he had been close to men of great wealth and he liked what he saw and heard . These men were one of the reasons he decided that there was more to life than just making a comfortable living as one of the top shorthand experts and as an organizer of office staffs . So , after the war , he decided to travel in search of better opportunity . He ended his travels in New Orleans with only ship passage back to New York . On the ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Shuberts and that successful song writers , like Irving Berlin , made a great deal of money . He apparently decided then to become a song writer . His conviction was strengthened when he returned to New York and found the tales of wealth to be true . He went about planning his new career in a novel fashion . Tried Writing Songs He spent months in the libraries , studying the lyrics of hit songs going back to 1890 . He realized that such men as Berlin and Jerome Kern had special talent . But he was convinced that he could discover a formula for lyrics that would work for lesser talents . He decided that hit songs  --  so far as he was concerned ? either relied on glorification of the commonplace or on the use of odd words and sounds . His first song , in 1920 , " Ai n't Nature Grand , " earned $5,000 for him and proved the first point . Then , since " K-K-K-Katy , " had been a wartime smash , he , wrote " You Tell Her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His deter-I mination to do a song using the sound " oo , " succeeded with " Barney Google , " based on the famous comic strip character of that day . And in 1923 he had another smash with " That Old Gang of Mine , " which was used in the " Ziegfeld Follies . " That year his income topped $100,000 and he was only 24 . His first million seemed in sight . Turned to Nightclubs Song-writing , however , was not enough for the young man , who had changed his name from Rosenberg to Rose . He decided to expand into another form of show business , nightclubs . In 1924 he opened a small place on top of a garage . In keeping with a love of theater he never lost , he called it the Back Stage Club . Prohibition was in effect and , with bootleg liquor , a loud , fivepiece band and customers that were a conglomerate of the underworld , Broadway and society the place often was open from late at night until the following noon . One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Helen Morgan , whose style with torch songs made her one of the great stars of the twenties , At this club he developed her style of sitting on the piano while she sang . She took her piano perch because there was no room anywhere else . Then Mr. Rose allowed his admiration for the wealthy to dull his business sense and showmanship . He gave up this club and decided to open a place that would cater exclusively to the . rich . This was his Fifth Avenue Club in a converted mansion . It had a stiff cover charge and a major-domo so austere that even Mr. Rose was intimidated by him . It failed. , In later years he said of this venture : " I made a mistake . I had thought I 'd make the Fifth Avenue Club exclusive . I made it so exclusive nobody came . " He never made that mistake again . His next venture , the Casino de Paree , broke ground for the kind of nightclub that catered to couples of more limited means . For a minimum of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner , dancing and a 90-minute show . The show had good looking girls with a minimum of clothes . In this club , which opened in 1933 , Mr. Rose was , he acknowledged in later years , a front for gangsters , getting $1,000 a week . During one period , when he did not receive a salary while traveling , he talked of I suing ' He then began to worry . With Walter Winchell as intermediary , the Federal Bureau of Investigation sent representatives to talk to the gangsters and nothing happened . He did not sue and he was not paid . Trying to summarize the approach of the Casino de Paree and his later nightclubs , he said many years later that they were " the real corn " and that he did not care " how stupid or silly the acts were . " In 1929 , Mr. Rose married Fanny Brice in a ceremony performed by Mayor Jimmy Walker at City Hall . Miss Brice had first asked to meet Mr. Rose because she was haunted by the lines " In the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' meant , " from his song " In the Middle of the Night . " Miss Brice professed to be disappointed by Mr. Rose 's slight stature , but a few weeks later they married . His life then became something of a struggle to avoid being known as a celebrity 's husband . It was shot afterward that Mr. Rose made his first venture into the theater . He decided to produce a musical for Miss Brice , then a top star of Broadway musicals . It opened in 1931 as " Crazy Quilt , " and would have been a total failure except that he later converted it into a revue and sent it on a successful tour of the country . But it was with " Jumbo " that Mr. Rose showed an imagination and courage that even his - enemies conceded was considerable . He conceived of having a - show that would combine a circus , story and music . The book was by Ben Hecht and Charles ; the songs by Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart ; the direction by George Abbott and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his orchestra to play the show for $5,500 a week . The only theater large enough to hold such a show was the old Hippodrome , which had been dark for many years . In 1943 , eight years after the opening of " Jumbo , " Mr. Rose had a big Broadway hit in the all-Negro version of the opera " Carmen . " It was called " Carmen Jones , " ran for three seasons , had a tour on the road and became a movie . In 1936 he was hired by Fort Worth to arrange its exhibition on the centennial of Texas 's statehood . Fort Worth 's arch rival , Dallas , just 20 miles away , was spending millions on an exhibition of its own . The Fort Worth show had a budget of about $500,000 . Mr. Rose toured the Dallas fairgrounds , noting the many scientific and technological displays rising there . He decided that only girls could meet the competition and he phrased a slogan that is still heard in Texas : " Dallas for Education ? Fort Worth for Entertainment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fort Worth and Mr , Rose , who reportedly received $1,000 a day for his services . After World War II , Mr. Rose began his last three careers in earnest . He had a syndicated column that appeared in as many as 100 newspapers . How much of it he wrote was always a matter of dispute . Lee Rogow , a critic , was said to have done much of the writing . But in his two other careers ? investment and art collecting ? he had no ghosts , though he made no secret of the fact that he sought the best advice he could get . A. T. &; T. and I. B. M. A few years ago he told an interviewer that he owned about 80,000 shares in American Telephone and Telegraph , worth at that time about $10-million . He also made substantial investments in International Business Machines and other electronics companies . His home at 56 East 93d Street had a " trading room , " with ticker , telephones and files of vital information . Just before his death , his real estate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the west side of the Avenue of the Americas from 54th to 55th Street . While his financial and real estate investments increased , he became widely known as an art collector . After making his gift of sculpture to Israel , he said in an interview : " Outside the fact that you ca n't cuddle up to art , I get very much the same sort of joy I get out of friendship with a beautiful girl . " Eventually , Mr. Rose said at the time , he planned to give to Israel some 20 paintings , including a Gainsborough , Turner , Romney and Reynolds . The sculpture inclueed works Rodin , Maillol , Daumier and Sir Jacob Epstein . Mr. Rose 's former wives , besides Fanny Brice and Joyce Mathews , were Eleanor Holm , the swimmer , and Doris Warner Vidor , daughter of Harry Warner , the film producer . All his marriages ended in divorce .
