Had Surveyor 3 landed on the moon 's Ocean of Storms some 4 billion years ago , it might have created an even bigger splash than it made last week . For early in lunar history , Nobel Laureate Harold Urey told the National Academy of Sciences last week , the moon may have had an atmosphere , rainfall , lakes and even oceans . <P> Unlike most scientists , Chemist Urey believes that water-not lava-formed the smooth lunar plains and filled-in depressions revealed in photographs taken by Ranger and Orbiter spacecraft . The dark plains , he says , " look precisely like the bottoms of dried-up , primitive oceans or lakes . " And material in filled-in craters and crevices may once have been flowing mud . <P> Urey suggests that lunar water had a terrestrial origin . If the moon was torn from the earth , he says , it would have carried off substantial amounts of water . Or if , as Urey believes , the moon was a planetary interloper captured by the earth , its gravity would have attracted terrestrial water as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its close approach to the earth . <P> Fascinating Possibility . The moon could not remain wet for long , says Urey . Because of weak lunar gravity , the water that evaporated during the moon 's long , hot days would have escaped into space , along with the primitive atmosphere . Within a few thousand years after they had formed , Urey believes , the lunar waters dried up , before they could carve out major features such as valleys and stream beds similar to those formed by water flowing on earth . If any water remains on the moon today , he says , it is probably in the form of ice buried below the surface and insulated from solar heat . The gradual melting and vaporization of this ice , which would leave voids beneath the surface , may account for the cave-ins visible in moon-probe photographs . <P> Urey bases his wet-moon theory on far more than mere visual evidence . As he sees it , most of the earth 's stony meteorites come from the moon , knocked off by other meteorites and occasional comets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those moon-sent meteorites are smooth fragments that appear to have been shaped by frictional effects like those that would be caused by flowing water . They also contain such minerals as clay-type silicates and calcium carbonates that Urey says " can hardly be accounted for except by the action of liquid water over some length of time . " <P> The meteorites also contain carbon compounds that suggest an even more fascinating possibility . They could have been produced , says Urey , by primitive life forms that survived their violent passage from the earth and multiplied rapidly in the lunar waters during the few millenniums that the moon was wet .
