Inexorably , the U.S. intensified its air assault against the Vietnamese Communists . <P> Eight times in 13 days , U.S. and South Vietnamese bombers blasted in stallations north of the 17th parallel , moving ever closer to Hanoi . During a single week , U.S. and South Vietnamese pilots flew 17,570 sorties on both sides of the border . Their chief target was North Viet Nam 's radar network : with everything from half-ton bombs to deadly white phosphorous , they hit Donghoi , Hatinh , Cap Mui Ron and , in strikes by 100 Navy planes from the aircraft carriers Coral Sea and Han cock , Bachlongvi Island , only 80 miles from Red China 's heavily fortified Hainan Island . For the first time , U.S. pilots were allowed to seek out targets of opportunity instead of limiting their attacks to targets chosen in Washington . They were quick to exercise their new option . In one raid , eight F-105 Thunderchiefs found a break in the clouds over a radar site at Vinhson , swooped down to destroy it , then turned to sink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with little public fanfare , but U.S. military men could not conceal their satisfaction . Said Seventh Fleet Commander Paul Blackburn of the North Vietnamese : " Those people are not getting much sleep up there . " <P> The Tightrope . They were beginning to sound cranky about it up there too . When Yugoslavia 's Tito urged talks to settle the war , North Viet Nam irritably accused him of " peddling the sinister design of ' peaceful negotiations . ' " When the Viet Cong guerrillas said they were considering asking Communist countries " to send youths and army men , " Peking responded with a promise " to send our men whenever the Vietnamese want them .

" Added Chou : " The American Government will never force the South Vietnamese people and North Viet Nam into negotiations by intensifying the war . " <P> The U.S. was notably unfazed by the Red threats . At a Saigon Lions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " we do n't intend to get into World War III , " vowed that the U.S. would go right on escalating the Vietnamese war " in proportion to the requirements . " He wisely declined to discuss just how far the U.S. was prepared to go . " What has been done thus far , " he said firmly , " is public knowledge . What will be done in the future is something for Hanoi to worry about . " <P> In the Future . At week 's end Taylor flew back to Washington to report to the President-and he found Johnson steadfast in his policy of hitting the Communists where it hurts . Earlier in the week , at a three-hour White House briefing for 42 Governors , the President declared his determination to keep South Viet Nam free of Communist control whether it takes " 20 or 50 years . " <P> Later , in a 500-word policy statement to the Cabinet , he said that he was " ready to go anywhere at any time and meet with anyone whenever there is promise of progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Communist aggressors have given no sign of any willingness to move in this direction .
