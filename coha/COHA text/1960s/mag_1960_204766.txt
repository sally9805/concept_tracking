( See Cover <P> For more than two years the leaders of the two great power blocs have been slowly picking their way toward the summit . This week , under the long , tapering shadow of the U2 's wings , the summit conference and the dream of peaceful coexistence smashed against the rock of Nikita Khrushchev 's intransigent belligerence . <P> When his white Ilyushin jet bore him into Paris a day earlier than he had originally planned . Nikita appeared to be in a comparatively calm mood . At the country residence of Soviet Ambassador to Paris Sergei Vinogradov , he fed bread crumbs to the swans , even borrowed the scythe of a neighboring farmer and tried his hand at making hay . " Mr. Khrushchev has a fair cutting motion , " reported the farmer , " but since he is a stout gentleman , his stomach interfered with his swing . " <P> But in preconference talks with France 's Charles de Gaulle and Britain 's Harold Macmillan , Khrushchev 's geniality vanished . Obviously sensitive to the U2 's revelation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Russia was five years ahead of the U.S. in missile and space research , had the power to destroy the U.S. or any other enemy . " He came for no small talk , " glumly conceded a Macmillan aide . And West German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer , who , though excluded from the summit itself , had nervously flown to Paris to urge his allies to stand firm on Berlin , came away reporting that " Mr. Khrushchev seems to be in a bad mood . " <P> Just how bad became apparent when Nikita coldly refused to attend the first scheduled summit meeting , which had been planned as an intimate and secret confab amongst the Big Four alone . Instead , he announced , he would show up only for the large ( 24 people ) , on-record meeting whose proceedings he would be free to blare out to the world . <P> In the Salon . Shortly before 11 a.m. , the limousines , with their fluttering national standards , began to arrive at Paris ' freshly scrubbed Elysee Palace . Unsmiling , the Soviet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's colonnaded staircase to their destination : a sunny salon where once Madame de Pompadour used to hold intimate dinners for her cronies in the court of Louis XV . There , in view of the blossom-laden chestnut tree that dominates the Elysee gardens , the fateful confrontation began .
