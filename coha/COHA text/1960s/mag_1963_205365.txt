The way the Boston Celtics and the Los Angeles Lakers play it , Dr. Naismith would never recognize his game . Champions and challengers , East and West , old pros and ambitious upstarts , they are basketball 's Hatnelds and McCoys . In nine games during the regular season , the Celtics won four , the Lakers five , and each time it was a kneeing , elbow-digging blood feud . The Celtics , perennial champions of the National Basketball Association , jeered at Laker talk that Los Angeles was the " basketball capital of the world . " The Lakers called Boston a " bush town . " Last week the two teams met again in the playoffs for the year 's N.B.A. championship . And for six games , they put on the kind of brilliant , hard-nosed show that left basketball fans delirious-and even made fans of nonbelievers . <P> <P> " Running is our game , " said Laker Coach Fred Schaus , and he told his young team to chase the veteran Celtics ( aver age age : 29 ) off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were graceful about it . Bandy-legged Bob Cousy , 34 , the matchless playmaker , whipped sidearm passes the length of the court to launch Boston 's fast break . Towering ( 6 ft. 10 in . ) Bill Russell , 29 , swept in rebounds like an angry mother plucking her child from the arms of a too-attentive stranger . Sam Jones poured in points-29 the first night , 27 the next-as the Celtics , playing in Boston , swept the first two games of the best four-out-of-seven series . <P> The teams split the next two in Los Angeles , and the Celtics headed back to Boston , only one victory away from their fifth straight N.B.A. championship . " All we need , " said Boston Coach Red Auerbach , " is hustle and Russell . " Russell hustled ( 24 points , 27 rebounds ) , but the Lakers still clobbered the Celtics 126-119 . That made it three games to two , and the Celtics sounded tired . " I ca n't take it any more , " said Cousy . " You play in Boston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plane , fly all day , hurry to the game and try to play . It 's tough . " <P> " Cousy 's Hurt ! " " We 've got ' em now , " cheered the Lakers , as 15,521 fans jammed the Los Angeles Sports Arena for Game No. 6-the biggest crowd ever to watch a basketball game in California . But in the first three quarters it was all Boston . Pushing his tired legs to the ultimate limits , Bob Cousy scored 16 points , set up another dozen baskets with his magical passing and led the Celtics to a 12-point lead . Then it happened . " Cousy 's hurt ! " gasped the crowd . Down on the floor , Cousy writhed in agony , clutching a sprained left ankle . Teammates carried him off . " Now , " cried the Laker fans-now was the time to move .
