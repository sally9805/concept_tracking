The U.S. Senate 's Interior Committee finally approved one of the most controversial of President Kennedy 's political appointees last week , but not without a wrangle that caused a sensation in the placid Virgin Islands and some raised eyebrows in Washington . At issue was the appointment of Millionaire Democrat Ralph Paiewonsky , 53 , to be Territorial Governor of the Virgin Islands . The question : How could Paiewonsky possibly avoid conflict of interest considering the fact that his family owns the islands ' biggest rum distillery as well as wide-ranging island interests in real estate , movies , liquor , stationery and gift shops ? <P> At the Senate hearings in Washington , Paiewonsky declared that there was no problem , since he had divested himself of all family holdings that might do business directly with the Government . He and his family had sold their $1,500,000 interest in the A. H. Riise Chemical &; Distillers Corp. , which buys molasses from the Federal Government 's Virgin Islands Corp . ( VICORP ) . As Governor . Paiewonsky would sit on the VICORP board . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that simple . Under sharper questioning , he testified that the family 's distillery interests had been sold to the Schenley Corp. , in which he and a brother held $250,000 worth of stock . A rum-distilling competitor , A. M. Brauer , took the stand to testify that Paiewonsky had once imported Cuban rum and transshipped it to the U.S. mainland falsely labeled as Virgin Islands rum , thereby dodging $1,000,000 in taxes . " He 's totally unfit for any position of public trust , " concluded Brauer . Answered Paiewonsky : he had indeed bought 5,000 bbl. of Cuban rum , but had never shipped it to the U.S. <P> Down in the islands , the sound of crashing surf was temporarily drowned out by the echo of charge and countercharge . Aroused pro-and anti-Paiewonsky factions fired hundreds of messages to Washington , about 9 to 1 in Paiewonsky 's favor . Said Novelist Herman ( The Caine Mutiny ) Wouk , who lives on St. Thomas : " Paiewonsky is the best man . " In Charlotte Amalie , the Seventh-day Adventist Church said prayers for Paiewonsky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to an end . With the Internal Revenue Service 's Alcohol Tax Unit clearing Paiewonsky of Brauer 's accusation , with Paiewonsky swearing to divest himself of the Schenley stock , and with the White House standing pat with its choice , the committee approved Paiewonsky as Governor . The full Senate was expected to go along .
