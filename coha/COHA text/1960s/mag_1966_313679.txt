THE DRAFT <P> From Congress to the campus and back again , debate over the inequities and eccentricities of the U.S. Selective Service System continued at high volume last week . Republican Richard Nixon blasted it as a potential " national scandal . " New York 's G.O.P. Senator Jacob Javits called it a " crazy quilt " of regulations ; he proposed instead a McNamaraesque plan for universal national service ( not necessarily military ) to include everyone under 35 . And Joseph P. McMurray , president of New York 's 20,000-student Queens College , snapped , " Let us stop pretending that enforced service is democratic , " and demanded that U.S. conscription be done away with - period . <P> As the criticism increased , so did talk about the advantages of a nation wide lottery . In the eyes of its advocates , some form of number drawing from an electronic hat would be more equitable - particularly since less than one-third of the pool of 1A eligibles ( about 995,000 men ) are currently being called . <P> Always Exceptions . Said Wisconsin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Men should be drawn essentially at random - which is simply a way of saying everyone will have an equal chance of being picked . <P> I stress that this should be a national drawing - a fundamental change from the very limited sort of lottery used by local boards at the beginning of World War II . " As explained by Reuss , a lottery would work thus : " Young men should be given their physical and mental examinations immediately upon registering at age 18 . If found eligible for service , they would then be given a one-year exposure to call for service between the ages of 18 and 19 . If not called that year , their liability would end - except , of course , in that kind of national emergency which requires practically everyone to serve . " <P> Massachusetts Democratic Senator Edward Kennedy also favors such an all-or-nothing lottery , and sees it as a selection system under which " rich and poor , college and noncollege , married and single , would take their chances on an even footing . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advocate admits there still would be deferments , exemptions and special dispensations - almost certainly still to be administered by the much maligned local boards . <P> Reuss wants to abolish the controversial 25 ( college student ) deferment as well as exemptions for fathers and some occupations , but he admits there should still be exemptions for conscientious objectors , the clergy , students in the middle of the school year , cases of " extreme personal hardship " and some " extremely vital " civilian jobs . <P> Fishbowl Equity . Teddy Kennedy 's plan has a slightly different wrinkle : he would let college-bound youngsters get their degree and then go into the lottery with everyone else who turns eligible that year . A Pentagon-based presidential study group , which is expected to release its two-year survey of U.S. draft practices some time this summer , has favorably considered a lottery plan under which even collegians who get married in school and have lots of children would not be bypassed once their numbers came up-except for extreme hardship cases .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
