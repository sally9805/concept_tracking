The high-powered international diplomatic pressure generated by the May Day U-2 intelligence flight over Russia by U.S. Pilot Francis Gary Powers erupted spectacularly this week at the Big Four summit conference in Paris . <P> Sitting across the table from the President of the U.S. , Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev vented a bitter attack on the U.S. and on Dwight Eisenhower . He withdrew his invitation to the President to visit Russia next month . He demanded an apology for the U-2 flight , threatened to break up the summit conference unless the U.S. would promise to punish all responsible for the flight and promise that all such overflights cease . He suggested , in the kind of face to face insult that strained even cold war diplomacy , that the summit should be adjourned until the U.S. could elect a new president . <P> The President accused Khrushchev of coming all the way from Moscow to Paris to deliver an " ultimatum " and to " sabotage " the summit meeting , yet offered to meet with him in a private two-way conversation to try to save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overflights had been sus pended " and are not to be resumed . " Then the President disclosed that he in tends to go to the United Nations with a new plan for aerial inspection of all countries to guard against surprise attack - a plan similar to his " open-skies " proposal made to the 1955 summit conference at Geneva , which Russia has repeatedly and emphatically turned down . <P> Right to Look . The summit eruption was brought on not only by the U-2 flight itself see following story ) , but by the fact that all last week the U.S. took the firm position that , in the circumstances of the cold war , it had a right to defend itself against surprise attack by intelligence activities . This policy was laid down first by Secretary of State Christian Herter in a formal statement . " The Government of the United States , " said he , as he prepared to go to the summit , " would be derelict to its responsibility not only to the American people but to free peoples everywhere if it did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such measures as are possible unilaterally to lessen and to overcome this danger of surprise attack . In fact , the U.S. has not and does not shirk this responsibility . " When Khrushchev responded with a threat to " strike " and " hit " at any nation that provided an airbase for such U.S. intelligence flights , the State Department replied that the U.S. would defend any foreign nation whose bases were so attacked . <P> " Utmost Confidence . " Herter 's proposition was recognized from the beginning as straining the bounds of international law ( see box , next page ) , and promised a briefcase full of problems . But both par ties in Congress closed ranks behind it . In the Senate , Majority Leader Lyndon Johnson said : " Espionage and intelligence gathering are not something that cause the cold war . Nikita Khrushchev can not use this incident in such a way as to divide the American people and to weaken our national strength . The American people are united in a determination to preserve our freedoms , and we are not going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
