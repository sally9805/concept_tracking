txt The city 's Housing and Development Administrator conceded yesterday that New York was not in danger of losing $75-million in Federal housing aid if the City Council and the Legislature did not approve a new housing code by March 2 . The administrator , Jason R. Nathan , said that city applications for new Federal aid would be delayed next summer if the Legislature and Council did not act by March 2 . But failure to act before the deadline , he said , would not endanger current aid , which amounts to about $75-million a year , nor would it prejudice future applications except to delay them . The housing code , which has not been revised in al // most 40 years , establishes standards of maintenance and safety , sets penalties for violations , and defines the city 's powers to remedy hazardous living conditions . During an interview Mr. Nathan revised statements he had made at a news conference last Wednesday , at which the proposed new code was released . At that conference Mr. Nathan said that if the Council and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would become ineligible for various Federal programs . " As recorded by WNYC the following dialogue then took place : Question : " What is the minimum you can expect to lose if this program does n't go through by that date ? " Mr. Nathan : " Seventy-five million a year , at least . " Yesterday he said : " I did not think I was giving the impression that the city would lose ; 75-million . " Mayor-Lindsay could not be reached for comment . Mr. Nathan 's original statement and others by administration officials led Davis Ross , Majority Leader of the Council , to attack Mayor Lindsay for " jeopardizing " the $75-million by submitting the code so late . Legal Status Explained Many political observers also agreed that the statements put the Council in the difficult position of either approving the controversial code in three weeks or causing the city to lose badly needed funds . Mr. Nathan acknowledged yesterday that his statement was subject to considerable qualification . The legal situation , he said , is this : On Sept. 2 , 1964 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an acceptable housing code in operation for six months as of ' Sept. 2 , 1967 . Such a code is pant of a city 's " workable program " ? a collection of laws and programs that a city must have to prove it can use Federal aid efficiently . The city 's workable program comes up for recertification on Aug. 1 . Even though that is a month before the deadline , Federal officials have ruled the city must adopt an acceptable code by March 2 . For every day after March 21 that the legislative bodies fail to act the city would not be able to apply for new Federal aid for a comparable period after Aug. 1 . For example , if the Council approved the code on April 2 city applications would be delayed from Aug. 1 to Sept. 1 . Pressure It Cited Mr. Nathan insisted that the delay of such applications could hurt the city 's housing program . The pressure for Federal funds is so great , he said , that if there was a delay appropriations might be used up before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yesterday he was unaware of the legal situation on Wednesday and issued his statement " in response to the Mayor 's press conference . " He noted that subsequent research indicated that funds would not be " endangered " if the Council did not act by March 2 . " The worst that I believe can happen is that there may be a delay in approval of city requests , " he said . However , he added , the council will still " move as rapidly as possible . " Housing officials in the Lindsay administration said Mr. Ross had refused to discuss the legislation with them before , it was publicly released . The 120-page housing code , which has been drafted over the last three years by Prof. Frank P. Grad of the Columbia University Law School , covers one and two-family dwellings for the first time . The lack of such coverage in the city 's present code is the main reason why Federal officials find it unacceptable . The proposed code would also increase tenant liability for violations in their own apartments , make landlords and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violations , expand the receivership and emergency repair programs , and make occupancy standards more flexible and easier to enforce . The Metropolitan Council on Housing and the East Harlem Tenants ' Council yesterday attacked the proposed increase in tenant liabilities . Such a law would " operate only to give landlords another tool to liarrass tenants , " the council said in a telegram to the Mayor .
