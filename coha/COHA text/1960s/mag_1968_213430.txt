Only the naive believe that patients in a state mental hospital get much personal attention from psychiatrists . There are too few psychiatrists and too many patients ; the ratio is about 1 to 100 . Many of the doctors are administrators who never see patients , and most of them have at least some administrative duties . And after the doctor takes out time for staff meetings and professional conferences , the patient is lucky if he gets 15 minutes of a psychiatrist 's time a week . <P> So who helps the patient ? Kansas ' Topeka State Hospital declares in an official pamphlet : " Patients are directly dependent on psychiatric aides , the only team members who are with them every hour of the day and night . The aides are likely to know the patient best . The aide 's influence on patients and the quality of person needed in his job are often underestimated by the public . The quality of treatment in mental hospitals depends directly on them . " <P> Work-ln . Yet one place where aides are most grossly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dramatic revolt on behalf of themselves and their patients , is Topeka State Hospital . Kansas ' state capital , with a population of only 133,000 , has long proclaimed itself on roadside signs as " the Psychiatric Center of the World . " That was based largely on the fame of the Menninger brothers , Karl A. and the late William C. , and their private C. F. Menninger Memorial Hospital , universally miscalled " the Menninger Clinic . " <P> In the 1950s , the Menninger brothers wrought a transformation at the nearby state hospital . Thanks to their lobbying , the old snake pit was replaced by attractive modern buildings . Topeka State abandoned its bars , chains and straitjackets and began returning " incurable " mental patients from the shadows of its back wards . ( One woman was released after 53 years in confinement . ) Kansas led the states in the modernity and humanity of its approach to mental illness , and its budget of $8 a day for a patient 's care was about the nation 's highest . But that was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city was shocked to find that Topeka State 's psychiatric aides had staged , in effect , a one-day strike . They did not call it a strike , but an " administrative takeover , " and they stayed on the job for twelve hours instead of the usual eight to show that they were willing and able to give the patients more and better care than the bureaucracy would allow . Later they changed the name of their demonstration , for propaganda reasons , to a " work-in . " By whatever name , it stopped Topekans from boasting about their mental-health facility and started them talking instead about " that mess out there . " <P> At first , Dr. Alfred Bay , superintendent of Topeka State , reacted like a Mayor Daley of psychiatry . He fired the aides , had many arrested and spoke of eradicating disorder " before it spreads to the patients . " Other officials called the aides ' demands preposterous -a 35% pay increase , 40-hour week , revised job specifications , union representation on administrative bodies , a two-year contract , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for advancement .
