Apparently , Iraq 's General Abdul Karim Kassem had thought he was only offering an Arab pleasantry when he announced his intent to " liberate " oil-rich Kuwait . He was amazed when alarm bells went off all over the Middle East . At Sheik Abdullah as Salim as Sabah 's cry for help , Britain in a matter of hours poured 3,000 crack troops , with their tanks and troop carriers , into Kuwait from bases in Kenya , Aden and Bahrein . A British aircraft carrier and a fleet of warships appeared offshore ; another flotilla steamed toward the area from the Mediterranean . After the fiasco at Suez , the British were delighted at the chance to demonstrate that they could still defend the vital areas of the Middle East that are the source of Britain 's oil . <P> Storm &; Drink . The troops swiftly dug in along the scorched ridge of sand that separates Iraq from Kuwait . But the Iraqis made not a move . Faced by a no-show foe , the troopers concentrated on survival in the searing heat ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one bare-chested trooper : " To qualify as a royal marine , all you have to do is be able to drink 19 Cokes daily . " British and Kuwaiti officers shuttled companionably between neon-bright Kuwait City and the front in Sheik-supplied Cadillacs and Chryslers . Declared Brigadier General Derek Horsford , Britain 's infantry commander : " Wherever my troops have gone here , they have been clapped and cheered - including me . " <P> Scolded smartly by Nasser 's United Arab Republic for exploding " a foolish smoke bomb , " even Kassem started acting as if his invasion threat had been a desert mirage . " Peaceful means , " he announced blandly in Baghdad , " will prevail over tanks U.S. Ambassador John Jernegan 's Independence Day reception , where he was escorted inside by ten U.S. marines and ten of his own Czech-armed bodyguards . Seemingly oblivious of his scathing attacks on " imperialist " Britain , Kassem deadpanned : " Our relations with Britain are stronger than before our revolution , being based on mutual interest . I like the British . " <P> Cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less like a hero than an inspired eccentric to most of his countrymen , Kassem brays nonetheless that he is " a man England wo n't be able to beat . " He explained : " The British planned to get all the Arabs against me as the aggressor . But , instead , I have united all the Arabs against imperialism . The Arab peoples are already with us . Soon the Arab governments will also be with us . " <P> <P> Most Arab governments were still annoyed that Kassem had brought on " imperialist " intervention . Nasser allowed a British aircraft carrier and five other warships to pass through the Suez Canal en route to Kuwait without a word of protest , but finally decided he disliked the British more than Kassem . " Kassem is only a bad cold , but British imperialism is a cancer , " wrote Nasser 's favorite journalist . The U.A.R. forthwith sponsored a Security Council resolution urging an immediate British withdrawal from Kuwait . With support only from Russia and Ceylon , the resolution was defeated .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
