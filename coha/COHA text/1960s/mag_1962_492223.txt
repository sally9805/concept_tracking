RING OF HATE AROUND I ins iS the 1011011 in a , cries of reports Irons the Middle East hi . a Post editor-phologrciplier team . In a refugee village near the old city of Sidon on the south coast of Lebanon Arab children play before a no schoolhouse on whose whitewashed walls is scrawled this angry challenge : PALFSTINL IS OUR HOME . To RETURN HOME IS OUR GOAL . To STRUGGLE Is OUR WAY . SACRIFICE IS OUR DUTY . FAITH IS OUR SWORD . DEATH DOES NOT FRIGHTEN Us . PALESTINE ! OURS , OURS , OURS . Most of the children who chant this hymn , with its overtones of hope and hate . never saw the Palestine to which they are determined to return . They were born in the tents of the refugee town , or in the flat-roofed mud huts which replaced the first tent city . Yet if a stranger asks one of them where is his home , he does not point to a house ; he gives the name of the village in Palestine from which his parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Holy Land in 1948 . In all the countries where the Palestinian Arabs have found refuge , photographer John Bryson and I found this same spirit of longing and defiance . The world has long since grown weary of the refugees and their plight . to which there seems to be no solution . but the refugees have not become reconciled to their fate . They have , instead , nursed their rankling sense of injustice , have fanned the flames of their hatred for Israel and all who support her , and have instilled in their children horn in exile the burning conviction that someday , with Allah 's help , they will drive the Israelis into the sea . This glorious vision of revenge and restoration possesses the minds not only of 1,200,000 refugees but of 40,000,000 Arabs in Syria , Jordan . Egypt , Saudi Arabia and Iraq , whose leaders in every public utterance repeat with Cato-like monotony the grim axiom that Israel must be destroyed . Beneath this surface bravado . however , lurks an awareness of reality . Israel is there , 2,000,000 strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who nursed her through her infant years for political as well as compassionate reasons , will not let her he destroyed . The Arab nations know this to he true , and the anger and frustration born of this knowledge color their attitudes toward the West . To the Arab , " the friend of my enemy is my enemy . " No matter what helping hand is held out in friendliness to him , if it has also helped Israel , it must be struck down . The Arab view is put bluntly in a release by the government of Gaza , where 264,000 refugees crowd into a strip of land thirty miles long by five miles wide : We hate Zionism and the Zionists . We do not like any nation that supports them . The American people have our love .. .. But governments that fall under the influence of world Zionism ... evoke our abhorrence and hate . The problem of the refugees , therefore , is more than the question of what to do about a million helpless human beings who must be fed , sheltered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeper sickness the seemingly insoluble Arab-Jewish question  --  which poisons the mind of every Mideasterner and in time must threaten the peace of the world . A brief review of recent history indicates to what degree Arab-Israel antagonism can set in train a series of events which extend far beyond the Middle East and bring the world perilously near the brink of global war . In 1955 Egypt and Israel were striking at each other in small but bloody raids across the Gaza Strip  --  with Egypt getting the worst of it . Mr. Nasser obviously needed arms , which he could have obtained from us. if we could have had his promise that they would not be used against Israel , our protege . This promise Mr. Nasser could not give ; the most rabid of the Israel haters , he turned to Czechoslovakia for arms . His move irritated the late Mr. Dulles. , who announced that we would not help Egypt build the huge Aswan Darn , which would turn a million acres of desert into arable land . Angered , Mr. Nasser seized the Suez Canal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the French , who mounted an air and sea attack upon Egypt while an Israel task force struck swiftly toward the canal . The United States found itself in the embarrassing position of having to demand that its two oldest allies cease their attack on Egypt , and that Israel pull her troops back from Sinai . At the same time , the Russians were threatening London and Paris with bombs  --  a threat which , if carried out , would have involved the world in nuclear war . Since this flare-up in 1956 an uneasy peace , broken by minor clashes , has prevailed along Israel 's jagged frontier . Along the boundaries of the Gaza Strip and the shallow ditch that marks the line between Egypt 's Sinai and Israel 's Negev , armed soldiers of the United Nations Emergency Force stand a lonely watch . Occasionally a wandering Arab eludes their patrols . A few days later UN headquarters at Jerusalem receives word from Israel that a body will be delivered to the Belt Hanun check point on the border of the Gaza Strip . A UN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the files of the UN . Along the nearly 400 miles of border which Israel shares with Jordan , Syria and Lebanon , an unarmed UN force  --  the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization  --  carries out jeep patrols under a white flag that proclaims the UN 's neutrality . UNTSO 's function , through its Mixed Armistice Commissions which serve each country , is to provide a safety valve . The UN 's representative is an arbiter who can rule on the small infractions which exacerbate raw feelings  --  the case of the Bedouin who drives his sheep into Israeli grass , for example , or the Israeli farmer who runs his plow across the fuzzily defined border onto Arab land . Nothing concrete is accomplished . Invariably the side accused denies all guilt and refuses to discuss the charge . The arbiter makes his decision in a vacuum , and another report goes to burial in the UN files . " UNTSO , " said one of its members , " is absolutely ineffective  --  and absolutely indispensable . It can not punish . It can only provide a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It keeps a minor border incident from flaming into war . " The 5300 Danes , Norwegians , Indians , Brazilians , Canadians and Yugoslays who make up the UN Emergency Force have a larger responsibility . They are authorized to use force to stop border crossings , or to put down any armed conflict between Arabs and Israelis . Armed only with rifles and light machine guns and spread thinly along the 150 miles of border from the sea at Gaza to the Gulf of Aqaba , where the boundaries of Israel , Sinai , Jordan and Saudi Arabia meet , they would be ineffective if either side should launch 0 an all-out assault . Their impact is moral rather than military . Him long these UN forces can keep the peace between Arab and Israelite no one can foretell . The pressures are building , up instead of lessening . A few months ago Dr. John H. Davis , director of UN RWA , the UN 's huge refugee Relief and Works Agency said , " The refugee problem is still growing in size and complexity . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It hangs as a cloud over the peace of the world . " 70 When UNRWA was created in 1950 to house , clothe and feed the Palestinians who had taken refuge in neighboring Arab states , their number was estimated at 652,000 . Today , they number about 1,200,000 . More than 433,000 of them live in UNRWA villages and are entirely dependent upon the charity of the UN . More than 870,000 draw the UN 's meager food ration of 1500 calories a day in summer . 1600 in winter . They encircle Israel 's borders with a noose of hate-623,000 of them in Jordan , 264,000 in the Gaza Strip , 138,000 in Lebanon , 128,000 in Syria and 10.000 in Iraq . Others are scattered elsewhere throughout the Middle East . The number now carried on UN RWA 's rolls is admittedly inflated . In the first days of UNRWA an Arab , riding a donkey , would show up with his wife and children , to place his family on the ration rolls . He would appear later in different dress . under another name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vife and a borrowed set of children . Many of these duplicate cards are still in use . Deaths are concealed from the authorities , for the rules require that the ration cards of those who die must be turned in . To combat this chicanery , UNRWA has stopped issuing ration cards for newborn babies . This forces the refugees to redistribute the cards of the dead to the newborn . " It seems harsh , but it was necessary , " an UNRWA official explained . Our budget for 1962 totals about 539,000,000 . That provides about eight cents a day to feed an individual refugee , and in the past we could not meet the increase so long as the dead were still on the rolls . Now , a father dies , a daughter has a baby . The death is not reported , but the families see to it that the baby gets the dead man 's ration . " Since 1948 , UN and other agencies have spent more than S382,000,000 on relief and rehabilitation of the refugees . Of this sum , the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 percent ; the Soviet Union gave nothing . In its effort to keep the refugees alive and healthy , UNRWA has achieved remarkable success . Refugees , for all their meager ration , are healthier than the rank and file of Arabs . Absolutely no progress has been made , however , in solving the basic problem of their repatriation or resettlement . In 1948 a UN resolution urged that " the refugees wishing to return to their homes and live in peace with their neighbors should be permitted to do so at the earliest practicable date , and compensation should be paid for the property of those choosing not to return . . . . " The UN also resolved that its Conciliation Commission in the Mideast should seek " repatriation , resettlement and the economic and social rehabilitation of the refugees . " In 1952 it set aside S250,000,000 for this purpose , but the money was never used . The Arab nations would not permit resettlement outside of Palestine , nor would the refugees themselves accept it . This year UN resolutions for the fourteenth time will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the refugees has not been effected , nor has there been resettlement on any appreciable scale . The reason for this tragic failure lies in the deep emotions which stir the hearts of Arabs and Israelis alike and allow for no negotiation and no compromise . In barest outline , the Israeli attitude is this : The land of Palestine has been the one true home of the Jews of the world since the time of Abraham . Their return there is in fulfillment of the promise made to them in Holy Scripture ? " And they shall come that were lost in the land of Assyria , and they that were dispersed in the land of Egypt . " They have come to carry out , through their unremitting labors , the prophecy of Isaiah that " Israel shall blossom and bud and fill the face of the world with fruit , " and to defend by combat , if need be , the security that was promised them by God , who pledged that " My people shall dwell in peaceable habitations and in sure dwellingsand in quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Jewish view , is the oldest sovereign state in the world . It did not lose its franchise when the Roman Emperor Titus destroyed Jerusalem seventy years after the birth of Christ and scattered the Jewish people to the ends olthe earth , nor has its claim been abrogated by the usurping governments which have come there since . Half a century ago they began to buy back their birthright by peaceful purchase . They were carrying , out this program , aided by the compassionate nations of the world , when in 1948 the British protectors of Palestine withdrew , and the armies of five neighboring Arab countries suddenly attacked the infant state . Faced with annihilation , Jewish men and women who remembered the horrors of Belsen and Buchenwald defeated the Arabs and seized by right of conquest the land which now is Israel . The 652,000 Arabs who abandoned their homes and properties were not driven out by Israeli armies . They left on the orders of Arab leaders , who promised them they could come back  --  once the Arab armies had triumphed  --  to divide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 148,00 ? Arabs who chose to stay ? they now number 240,000 ? have lived peacefully in Israel since , sharing in the new opportunities of the burgeoning land . Those who fled , the Israelis argue , have nursed their hatred for fourteen years . It is obviously impossible , therefore , for a nation of fewer than 2,000,000 Jews , still struggling for survival , to welcome a million sworn enemies into its territory . Thus full repatriation is out of the question . Compensation , on the other hand , can be considered . But before any Arab claims can be agreed on the rights of 700,000 oriental Jews , who lied to Israel from Iraq , Yemen and Algiers , leaving their properties behind , must be taken into account . This , in simplest terms , is the Israeli point of view . The Arab attitude can he expressed as briefly : Before 1948 Palestine had been the home of the Arabs for 1300 years , ever since 4000 nomadic horsemen came out of the Arabian deserts to conquer Jerusalem in the name of Allah . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political ends wished to plant a Western outpost in the heart of the Arab world , the Jews were simply invaders who seized the Arab homeland by force of arms . The refugees who left their homes did not leave willingly . They were driven out by Jewish terrorists . There is only one answer to this great injustice . say the Arabs . The displaced Arabs must be returned to their old homes ; their property must be restored to them ; and they must be compensated for the despair they have suffered during their years of exile . If the U.S. , Great Britain and the UN , who established Israel in the heart of the Arab world , can not force Israel to carry out her moral obligation to repatriate the exiles  --  the Arabs argue -- then they , in Allah 's own good time , will restore the Palestinians to their homes by driving Israel into the sea . Until the time for battle comes , however , they will content themselves with lesser measures . They will keep Israel sealed off from her neighbors , forbid her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right to trade with Arab nations if they also trade with Israel . Above all , they will strive to limit further immigration to Israel by the political harassment of countries such as the United States , whose Jewish population contributes the gifts and loans which make further immigration possible . If immigration continues , the Arabs insist , Israel must break out of her present boundaries to seize more Arab lands . This , in essence , is the Arab attitude . The Israelis deny that they want more land . All that lies beyond their present borders are more rocky hills and dry deserts  --  and more Arabs  --  they point out , and they have plenty of each already . Once her scientists learn how to harness the sun and the atom for power , and to make fresh water cheaply from sea water , Israel will have no need for more land , for the vast Negev Desert alone could feed all the Jews who choose to come . The Israelis consider the Arab threats of annihilation to be mainly bombast , but they train citizen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the age when an American boy is getting his first air rifle , the Israeli boy  --  and girl  --  is learning to use a Tommy gun . Israel . whose airfields lie ten minutes from Egypt 's bombers , also must match her enemies in the air and on the sea . Whenever Egypt buys a new MIG-19 from Russia , Israel , in self-defense , must counter with a SuperMysthe from France . When Egypt buys submarines from the U.S.S.R. , Israel must buy submarines from Great Britain . Thus the possibility of an explosion grows more imminent . Russia , in fact . could set it off any day she chose by releasing her 2,000,000 Jews for migration to Israel . Such an act , the Arabs claim , would make inevitable an Israeli strike for Lebensraum . The obvious question is : What can the U.S. do to ease the tension , to find a path toward some understanding by which the antagonists can learn to live in harmony ? The answer is : Not much , except to do all in our power to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LINEF , which guards the Gaza border and the international boundary . We can support and strengthen UNTSO in its efforts to settle squabbles by arbitration . We can continue our support of UNRWA , not only in its task of keeping the refugees alive but in its newer mission of providing vocational training for thousands of young refugees , so that they may find a livelihood in the developing Arab countries which need skilled workers . We can calm Jewish and Arab fears alike by assuring both that the outside world will not permit either to attack the other , and that present boundaries can he changed only by peaceful negotiations . We can diminish Arab distrust of the West by conceding their most cherished point : that a great injustice has been done to those Arabs who were forced to leave their homes ; that when the time comes to make reparation for this wrong , we will insist that Israel deal as generously with her Arab neighbors as the world has dealt with her . Certain hopeful proposals already have been made by our Government . Israel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 percent of the more than 1,200,000 refugees . Latin-American countries might be asked to accept as many as they could absorb . The Arab nations would be asked to resettle and rehabilitate the rest over a five-year period , aided by a $500,000,000 fund to be provided by the UN . Israel , at least , has displayed a willingness to negotiate  --  on her own terms . Some Arab leaders have indicated privately that they might accept the original UN partition plan which they rejected furiously in 1948 ? a compromise which , if accepted , would cost Israel about one fourth of her present land . No progress toward a final solution is yet evident , nor is any likely soon . " There are some wounds that only time can heal , and some problems only time can solve , " an American diplomat said . The Arab-Israeli issue is one of them . It would be fatal if we should try to force the issue now . All we can do is try to keep them from fighting .
