STERN ( 191 pp. ) - Bruce Jay Friedman - Simon &; Schuster ( $3.95 ) . <P> Behind the sword dancing and cymbal clashing of the bestseller lists , where titles assail the eye from ads and authors assail the ear on panel shows , there are books that glow and grow with a life of their own , " discovered " and talked up by readers rather than literary promoters . Currently sparking such a small-scale chain reaction is a strange and touching little first novel called Stern . It is giving Author Bruce Jay Friedman , 32 , who has published some short stories and who works in Manhattan as editor of an adventure magazine , a coterie reputation as a new novelist with an antic imagination and a style to match . <P> Stern is about being Jewish in a lawn-proud suburb of midcentury , middle-class America . But Stern is no sociological novel . Blurring fact and fantasy , it is funny and sad at the same time in the tradition of the Jewish schlemiel story and the Charlie Chaplin movie . <P> Dogs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with fat hands and " pale , spreading hips " whose job is to write descriptive literature on labels . His wife is large-eyed , long-nosed and sexy , his lonely eight-year-old son spends most of his time sucking on a blanket . Stern moves them to the suburbs , buys a house for $23,000 , and at once begins to suffer the consequences . <P> Stern 's unfamiliar , spread-out country world seems full of traps and tortures . Night after night , as he makes his way home through a neighboring cluster of houses , two huge dogs vault a fence and savagely escort him , his wrist held wetly in the lead dog 's teeth . Caterpillars munch away half of every shrub and tree on the place . " This house has been standing here for thirty years with whole shrubs , " Stern moans . " We 're in it a month and there are halves . " <P> Worst of all is the man down the road , who refused to let his child play with Stern 's ( " No playing here for kikes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ push that sent her sprawling and may ( or may not ) have allowed him a look beneath her dress . Fighting the " kike man , ' ' as Stern thinks of him , becomes a constant obsession ; he takes to worrying all day about whether he will have the courage to drive home from the station by the route that leads past the man 's house . And when he does , he takes off his glasses to look more formidable . One day he sees the man wearing the jacket of a veterans ' organization , and Stern 's heart turns over . " It meant the man had come through the worst part of the Normandy campaign , knew how to hold his breath in foxholes for hours at a time and then sneak out to slit a throat in silence . He was skilled as a foot fighter and went always with deadly accuracy to a man 's groin . " <P> " A Little Theatrical .

Stern emerges to have a nervous breakdown , which Author Friedman manages to make both hugely comic and horrendously real .
