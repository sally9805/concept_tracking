of his life . Up three steps , in at the gray entrance , into one of those self-service elevators within whose clicking , measuredsuspension one rode always with a sense of doom , no matter to what event . Then the anonymous room , whose steppeddowncolors and noncommittal furniture offered only the neuter comfort of no stimulus to either approval or dislike . Then , finally , another installment in the long , delicate auscultation of himself , during which , sometimes clamped in resistance , sometimesirrigated with relief , he had been free to pursue the quality of his fear . Turning away , he walked down to the corner and joined the vague group waiting for a bus . Wherever you went , at almost any time , on almost every corner , there would be such a group assembled . It was a deceptively impressive fact which , when elaborated on , he had long since learned , led nowhere . It was part of the provocative pulse of a city , of a world in which , if you did not learn to deflect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to seize upon them , to weld them into some philosophy of destination , you were lost indeed . He wedged himself onto the bus , carefully protecting the cake . Looking down at the white box , he thought tiredly of what a funny symbol it was of that daily switch-off in which , laying aside the engrossing thread of himself , he bought a cake , he took a bus , and  --  rapped smartly back into the secondary  --  he deserted for another day the re-creation of himself as a workingbeing . As a working being , he cautioned himself , he heard himself being cautioned by the dry voice from behind him in the anonymous room . For if the whole process had not helped him to hold himself untremulously at last in a world where others managed , what had it been but an infinitely seductive excursion into ego , after which , as cut off from others as he had been in the beginning , he would find himself twice alone , holding together the explored corners of himself ? Clutching the box in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Less than a year ago , down here , there had been nothing but the great cylindrical gas tanks , nuzzled by tenements , slotted shops , and the exhausted outbuildings natural to the wharflike streets near an old river . Now the " housing development " loomed upward before him , an incredible collage pasted against the sky . Even remembering the excavations and the swarmed signs of contractors , even forcibly recalling the scores of families who were inside it going through their daily paces like tidy , trotting simulacra of each other , it was hard to believe that the whole organism had not been stroked from a lamp . Looking at it , the eye seemed always to be trying to wipe it away . He and Dorothy had already been drawn into the imitatively suburban life of the young couples who lived there . Dorothy , of course , he thought , much more than he  --  since whatever time he had away from his university job was already so prescribed . Again he strove for a better picture of her , brushing aside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he passed the playground on the way to his classes , he had seen her sitting talking or reading or sewing with the other mothers , watching Libby as she played with the other beplaided and corduroyed toddlers in the austerely planned sandpit , alreadycluttered with buried rakes and spoons and lost tin fish . All of the mothers , still slender and attractive , looked like thirty-year-old versions of the college girls they once had been . Many of them had had careers or talents that marriage and children had interrupted or aborted , and to the memory of these they paid insistent and bitter homage , constantly totting up the frustrations of housewifery in remarks which were like a kind of bleak , allusive shorthand understood by them all . For now that they were women of the home , they felt an inferiority to their former selves , and so , too , they had constructed a technicalpatter full of words like " preschool " and " security " and references to " Gesell-and-Ilg , " as if by this subaqueous jargonp108they would return motherhood , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a profession . With Dorothy , however , he thought thankfully , this defeated prattling never had been more than part of her half naive acceptance of the New York " line . " She had been reared in a town where people , particularly the women , expected that life would deal with them according to those archaic truisms which , if no longer so hallowed as once , came to them , at least , withoutthe friction of disappointment . It had been this certainty in her which had drawn him as much as her mild blond good looks , whose exact lineaments so curiously evaded him now ; it had been to this sureness that he , already deeply flawed with irresolution , had clung and married himself , in the sick hope of transference . How was he to have foreseen , he thought now , that this very ability of hers to cope , this health , would become formidablebetween them , sending him further into his cowl of preoccupation , leaving her beached on normality , so that , strangers now , too far apart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrible binding familiarities of the joint board , the joint child , and , less and less often , the graceless despair of the commonbed ? For in the world of the normal , he knew now  --  he heard the dry voice say  --  to those whose qualms were always based on the tangible , the active , the real , how could he have seemed otherwise than intransigent , when he had insisted that in his world there was a basic , roiling chaos , over which the footage was never more than a series of staircases that dissolved as one trod them , in the midst of which alternatives faced one like knives  --  and people were only alternatives ? He walked on through the circuitous approaches to his own building . Light skittered , noise faceted from the hived buildings about him , lazily compounding a day , redolent of livelier Saturdaysand more expectant springs , which was like a percussivep109recall to health . Fear was all right , it said to him , as long as one could bring it out into the light and give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ditch now , almost up on the other , the safe side , with Dorothy and all the people who knew where they were going , and could manage . He turned in at Number 6 Village Drive , noting , as always , the cozy term applied to the massive clinical building whose entrance halls , all of nude beige marble enlivened only by buttons , held the etherized silence of a museum . It was difficult to believe that on its upper floors hundreds of doors opened on interiors rumpled with living and the intimate sediment of people , on kitchens checkered with the aftermath of meals , bathrooms , clotted with diapers and cream pots , at whose windowsstockings hung swinging in the dust motes and the sun . The door opened to his key and he stepped into the apartment , receiving the familiar impingement of the pictures , the chairs , the books serried just as he had left them . Everything waited for him like a box full of stale attitudes , old grooves in which he both fitted and chafed . As always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in view of the way Sunday'slax living jarred and crumbled it  --  almost as if Dorothy expected someone  --  or something . He hoped she was not going to expect too much of him at first . He had n't really thought , he had n't had time to think of it during these years , visualizing her , when at all , as a man in a ward visualizes the ordinaryones , cumbered with health , who wait patiently in the anterooms of hospitals . In the bedroom , Libby lay on his bed , her face locked fast in the upturned purity of sleep . Dorothy , face down on her own bed , turned her head toward him as he came in . Her mouth , drawn down at the corners at first , in the half-drugged enmity of the dreamer coarsely awakened , quivered faintly in greeting . Of course , he thought , feeling foolishly relieved . This is she . This is the way she is.  | " Hi , " he said softly , because of Libby . " Hl . " He looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She in for the night ? " She nodded . " I gave her an early supper . You know how it is otherwise . " She raised herself up on her elbow and pushed back her hair . " Mmm , " he said . He knew how it was . In her voice , her attitude , he heard the echoing plaint of the other women : " If you do n't let them nap then they 're cranky , and if you do then they never want to go to bed later on  --  and you have them on your hands till nine ! " Nobody seems to enjoy or glory in his children any more , he thought . We 're always plotting , calculatinghow to have a personal life in spite of them . " Thought you might want to go shopping or something , " he said , trying on a smile . In his mood , composed half of his release , half of the infectious rhythm of Saturday expectancy , he found himself thinking of the Saturday afternoons she used to love  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Libby had been a woollen-wrapped bundle carried jauntily on his shoulder  --  when they had been part of all the other families idling through the stores , trekking through Sears , perhaps  --  and coming out of that array of rose trellises and tires with a pair of curtains or a kitchen tool , they had returned home heartened and gay and somehow conquerors , through that device so feminine , so American  --  the purchase . " I 've done the shopping , " she said , with a faint look of surprise . " The Ewarts asked us upstairs for the usual . I thought we could come down once in a while to check . It 's too late for a sitter . " " Mmm . " He put the cake-box down on the night table , stretching his cramped hand . " Mocha , " he said . " Thanks . " She awarded it a brief , listless smile . He sat down carefully on the side of her bed . His hand , p 111braced on the bed , was near her waist . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the casual gesture . For both of them it had become a matter of pride not to admit , to solicit for the shaming need that was no longer closeness . Nightly , the tense waiting for the hand which did not come had sagged more and more often into sleep ; in the infinitesimal edgings away they had built the routine of remoteness . He put his hand in his lap , inspected it . " I 'm through , " he said . " At the doctor 's . " He gave her a quick , guilty look , and concentrated again on the hand . Except for the first of the month , when the bills came in , it had been a matter of rigid convention never to mention the doctor . " For good ? " she said . " He thinks . I hope . " She swung her legs down to the floor on the other side of the bed . After a minute , she padded around in front of him and sat down at the dressing table with her back to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran a finger over the bristles . He waited for her to speak , turn at least , but she began brushingher hair , slapping the brush against her head with a tired halfhearted stroke . He gave a self-conscious laugh , and again , the surreptitious look . " Ring out , wild bells , " he said . " I 'm sorry  --  " She turned . He waited , he told himself , for her to drop the damn brush . " I 'm sorry , " she repeated , " sorry I ca n't be more . . . oh well  --  " She looked down at the brush . " I know you expected me to be . . . well . . . waiting . " Then she put down the brush and the words came with a rush , a bitterness . " At the door . Or a street corner , maybe .

" She stopped . " To what ? " " To get over their love affair  --  with themselves . " " Love affair ! " " Ah , you know you loved it , " she said . " Spinning out yourself . Because meanwhile you did n't have to do anything  --  about anything or anybody . " " Would it have been better if I 'd had T.B. ? Something that showed ? " She put a hand out toward him , almost touching his knee , then drew it back . " I kept thinking of them all the time  --  all the wives , and husbands , and parents of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time , smoothing things over , picking up the pieces  --  holding their breath . What are we supposed to do ? Stop living ? " " If you felt like that , why did n't you say some  --  " " Oh no , " she said quickly . " I was n't supposed to interrupt  --  or intrude ! " It was true , he thought . What she had represented these three years had been the damaging real  --  which he had avoided even as he fought his way toward it . " I know it has n't been easy for you , " he said humbly . " Perhapsthat was part of my trouble . . . that I did n't think enough about that . But now  --  " " Vhat 's now ' ? " She looked down at her clenched hands . " People like me will always be on the outside . . . with people like you . " He got up heavily from the bed and crossed to the window . God save us , he thought , us  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and see it whole . From those who ca n't bury or evade the truth , but have to drag it out and beat it like a carpet . Who can say the raw , the open thing , that can never be glozed over again . He stared out the window , twisting one hand around and around in his pants pocket . " Come on , " he said . " Let 's go up to the Ewarts ' . " " No . I do n't want to go after all . " " Well , for God 's sake , " he said , sore with his new effort , " you 're always the one who 's trying to drag me ! " " Because it was better than being alone together . " She shrugged , smiling crookedly up at him . " Besides . . . Saturday night . . . one always hopes for the best . " " Come on then . " He met the smile with a placating one of his own . " No , It 's just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You know , " she said . " Like a record we all play once a week . Jim , hanging around , waiting for Esther to get drunk enough so she 'll go home , and Karen watching Lou for her reasons , and me watching you for mine . I just do n't want any part of it any more . " He watched it almost jealously , that soft , flexible look of hers , which concealed the enviable certitude , the stubborn strength to reject , to decide . " Well , what do you want to do ? " She looked away from him consciously . " I thought I 'd go back home for a while . If you 're really on your feet now . " " For a while ? Or for good ? " he said . For good , he thought . That 's what she asked , only a little while ago . She was silent . " What makes you think Utica , or any other place , is n't more of the same , these days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where . I just ca n't go on being an adjunct  --  any more ! " " And Libby ? " He softened his voice suddenly , as if their joint concern might wake her , where their forgetfulness had not . She put her head down in her hands , rubbing her concealed face back and forth . She 'll cry now , he thought , although he could not remember when he had last seen her cry , and he waited , almost with relief , for with women , the lucky women , this meant the dissolving of an issue , the haggled end of emotion  --  but she went on defeatedly rocking . " Come on , " he said , after a moment . " I 'll fix us a drink . " He waited , and then put a hand on her shoulder . " We 'll have a party by ourselves . " In the kitchen , his hands took over the mixing of the Martinis , picking out and combining the gin , the vermouth , the lemon peel , with disembodied competence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thought . " Is n't it ? Is n't it ? " he said defensively to the dry voice in the anonymous room . IIe thought of the crowd upstairs now at the Ewarts ' , in the pattern , as Dorothy had said , pooling all their uncertainties of the week , drowning them in the fabricated bonhomie of Saturdaynight . The Ewarts , Syl and Harry , were a few years older than the average couple in the building and were both " in business " ; perhaps it was a combination of these facts which led them into great spurts of energy , in which droves of people must be enlisted to help them kill the weekend 's frightening acreage of time . To their coarse-grained parties there came , patronizingly , the fledgling physicists , the writers on their way to a foothold , the confused but verbose young men with their foetally promising jobs in the government , in the State Department , or , like himself , in the universities . They came because they were at loose ends , or at odds with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the city , or , let it be said ,  |p115because  the Ewarts could serve the liquor they themselves could infrequently afford . And with each of them came the wife , in the new hair-do , the primary colored dress with its attempted primary appeal  --  all the intelligent , frustrated girls , fleeing from the diapers toward an evening in which they could forget their altered conceptions of themselves . He held the Martini mixer up to the light , and stirred , forestallingthe thought of Dorothy and himself with critical thoughts of the others . It 's true , what she said , he thought . Esther , having to drink herself into insensibility more and more often , with Jim doggedly watching , and Karen , flitting grimly , unobtrusively into the kitchen now and then to see that Lou 's reflex skirt-chasing does n't get him in more trouble than he can handle . And me , wrapped up in a corner . " For once let 's not think about me ! " he said defiantly to the voice in the repudiatedroom . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with reassurances to the sufferers , administeringglasses , plates of food , or winks in the direction of the bathroom . The sufferers , he thought . The prowlers in retreat from themselves . He put two glasses on a tray and looked at the light through the mixer for a last delaying time . It stared back at him like an unanswerable , viscous , lemon-watery eye . He walked back with it into the bedroom . Dorothy was stretched out on the bed again , staring into the pillow . " Want to go in the other room , or stay here ? " " Oh leave me be . Leave me be . " He put the tray on the dressing table and sat down beside her with a brisk , overemphasized resolve . " Come on , " he said , urging her up to a sitting position . " This 'll fix you up . We 'll rustle up some dinner later . " They sat on the side of the bed together , sipping , not saying anything , as if they both sucked desperately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he put a drink-loosened arm aroundp116her , using his other arm to refill the glasses , and they sat on in the growing dark , finishing the second drink , the third , watching with careful fixity the lambent points of their cigarettes . Outsidethe window , the light-studded evening converged , ramified , without them . A tremor in her shoulder made him know , suddenly , that she was crying , and trying to conceal it . He was cleft with pity , and even a kind of possessive pride because she was the sort of woman who did not cry for show . " Ah do n't , " he said . " Ah do n't . " She gave her head an angry , backward shake . " I 'm not trying to . . . oh you know ! " she said , in a strangled whisper . " I know . " He tightened the arm that was around her , and put his other hand blindly toward her . It met her face . She moved her face back and forth in his palm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fingers . " I 'm afraid , " she said . " That 's all it is . " " Afraid ? " he said , delicately handling the sharp tool of the word . " What are you afraid of ? " " That 's it . I do n't know . I never used to be . " He held her as she sobbed , knowing that for this , on which of all things he should have been most knowledgeable , there was no answer that he could give . But it seemed to him that the edged word , coming through the sweetish , gin-fogged air , came like a bond , a link which slit through the cocoon around himself . He began to kiss her with a kind of heavy sympathy for them both . Turning , they stretched out on the bed and made use of one another in a final spasm of escape . Long after she slept he lay awake in the dark , which had a pallid incompleteness from the deflected street lights outside . After a while he got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clock . It was only nine o'clock . He crossed to the other bed , his own , near the window , and picked up the sleepingchild . Holding her , on his way to the crib in her own room ,  |p117her  warm , inert weight seemed to him like a burden he was inadequate to carry . " Parents like us ! " he thought . This must be why we avoid them , the children , because they are the mirror we make for ourselves . They are the alternative of no evasion , on whose knife we are impaled . He put her down , tucking the light blanket carefully around her , and went back into the other room . Through the window he saw and heard it  --  the Saturday night pattern  --  its neon blotted by haze , its multiplying , loose roar jingled into softness by the tricky distances of spring . It seemed to him that he heard in it , in that heightened blend of the hundreds of gurgling , cheeping noises of daily living , some of which were quickened for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never more than quickened  --  that he heard all around him the endless echolalia of his time , his world , his trap . They were all down in the ditch with him , the prowlers , and the weak alarums of their malaise lacked even the dignity of the old ecclesiastical cry : " Father , what are we ? And whither do we go ? " For , in our cleverness , he thought , we know what we are , and in the sadness of no mystery , we know where we are going . He looked down at the other sleeping figure , wondering what there was in the construction , the being of a face , that had once made it his vital necessity , and that now , by some combinationof circumstance and familiarity as brutal as it was quiet , had been attenuated past recall . He looked down , waiting , wishing for a sense of ruin . For ruin implied salvage ; it implied the loss of something dear . Where there was a sense of ruin , there might also be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small , dark American woman walking up the Via Aurelia Antica in the sauterne Romansunlight , was glad that she had worn the good brown pumps with the low French heels . " Take the Monteverdi bus from the Piazza Fiume , " Mrs. Wigham , the British journalistresident in Rome , had said on the phone . " After that , it 's a twenty-minute walk . " But of course it was turning out to be a very British twenty-minute walk , as the American had suspected it might . Visiting Italian villas , if one had no car and must watch long cab fares , had a technique of its own . One had to be dressed to cope with the crammed filobus , the dodging between motorcycles on the steep walk afterward , the long , cobbled approaches to the houses themselves . But once there the amourpropremight have to cope with a room full of signoras dressed with their usual black and white graffito perfection or , worse still , with those of one 's own countrywomen who traveled preservedin some mysterious , transportable amber of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the brown shoes would about do . She smiled to herself , remembering that she had read somewhere that a lady always traveled in brown . The road was walled on each side , so that the sun scarcely glinted on the occasional green Vespa , red Lambretta or on herself , the only pedestrian . Here was a door set tight in the wall  --  number four , and number three had been minutes back . Number twenty-two might well be another mile away . Well ,  |p122time  is not time in Italy , she reminded herself . " My time is your time , " she sang under her breath , and walked on . After a while she came to the top of a hill and saw four priests approachingfrom the opposite direction , walking along in their inevitably coupled way . From above , the four black discs of their hats , with the round , center hubs of crown , looked like the flattened-out wheels of some ancient bas-relief vehicle . The wheels of the church , she thought , and crossed the road . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numero ventidue  --  e lontano ? " In a flood of smiles and gestures they waved her on . High above her head the embankments hid the greenery , making the way seem endless . From the dust of the road came the deciduous , stony smell of antiquity . Her lowered eyes caught sight of a pebble , smooth and egg-shaped , rather like the white jelly-bean stones her younger boy at home in the States had in his collection . She passed it , hesitated , and went back for it . I found it on the Via Aurclia Antica , she would tell him . On Easter Sunday afternoon . At home it would still be morning . Her boys , released from the school chapel , would be at dinner in the commons or horsingin the yard . It was a habit she had not been able to break , these six months away  --  this counting back to what time it was over there . She had n't wanted to go , she had n't . But " Go ! " all the others on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once in seven years . " And four of those a widow , " they must have whispered behind her . " Perhaps . . . over there . . . " Well , they would find her the same as before her sea change . At forty , forty-one , to range the world like a honing girl , the eye liquid , the breast a cave , was no more decent abroad than it would have been at home . One learned to be alone over here , as one had back there . It was like baggage . She slipped the stone into her pocket and went on . At last she came to the high iron gates of number twenty-two . They swung open , released by the invisible keeper in the hutp123at the side , and at the end of a driveway shorter than most she came to the house  --  nothing of museum grandeur about it , like others she had visited , but low , extended in a comfortableway and about the size of her house at home . No one was about . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called , but did not . " Hello ? " she said , and waited . " Hell-lo-o . " Mrs. Wigham came round the corner of her house , neatly gray-haired , sweatered and skirted in dun , a sensible Englishwomanat home in her garden , in whatever country that garden might be . " Ah , Mrs. Bowman , so happy to meet you , " she said . " The Maywoods wrote me about you . On leave from your post , they tell me . " They shook hands . " Sociology , is it not ? " said Mrs. Wigham . " Are you going to be studying us for a book ? " " No , " said the American , laughing . " I tell myself I 'm seeing and being . " " Oh , well . No one ever does much work in Rome . " Mrs. Wigham led the way , past potting sheds , up a brief staircase , into the house and out again . " Two of your compatriots are here this afternoon , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her husband owns a film company , something like that . " She mentioned a name , one of the pioneer , supercolossal names . " Oh , yes , of course . No  --  I do n't know her , " said Mrs. Bowman . " She 's here with a friend of hers sent me by our film man in London . A lady who writes for the films , I believe . " Mrs. Wigham , correspondent for a London daily , had that pale , weathered glance which was perhaps de rigueur for middle-aged British lady journalists . It had never seen mascara perhaps but , in a quietly topographical way , it had seen almost everything else . It rested thoughtfully now on Jane Bowman . " You know of her , possibly ? A Miss Francine Moon ? " " No , " said Jane Bowman . " I , er  --  I 've never been to Holly/wood . " There , she thought . Was that snobbery or modesty ? Have I established myself as sufficiently Eastern seaboard and impecunious ? When abroad alone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stifle this terrible desire to establish oneself , knowing full well that , with the British , any overtness about this would establish one all too well . She stared at Mrs. Wigham 's back as it led the way to the terrace . The most mapconsciouspeople in the world , they were , yet they still alluded to the States as once they might have to Kenya  --  as to one of those vast but cozy terrae incognitae where certainly everybodyknew everybody else . But when they came out on the terrace and she was presented to the three ladies seated there in the magnificent light that made paintable even the debris of afternoon tea , she was less certain that " the States " was not the intimate terrain that her hostess had presumed it . On their left , the pleasantfacedelderly woman who had answered to the name of Miss Hulme with a brisk " Dew ! " was surely English  --  hatted and caned and wrapped in woollens whose lines one was not meant to pursue . But it was the nearer of the two hatless American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the light with a precision that defeated any tenderizing chiaroscuro of Roman air . But of course , I do in a way know her , thought Jane . If I were sleepwalking in Arabia deserta and I opened my eyes on her image , I would know her . Gray tailleur , a " Ford " as Seventh Avenue calls it , lapel pin so expensively junk that it does not have to be real . Enormous alligator bag  --  for this is one of the things that must not be counterfeited  --  and yes , there are the matching shoes . Gold of bangled wrist , flint of ageless figure , perhaps forty , hair irrefragably gold and coiffed not ten minutes before , butterfly glasses with this year 's line of twisted gold at the bridge . How should I not know her  --  this artifact of Northp125America , authentic in its way as the pebble I picked up back there on the road ? " Francine Moon , " said this person , reinforcing their hostess 's hummed introduction . One felt her to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living in London for the past six months , " said Mrs. Wigham . She looked from one American to the other with the bright teatime glance of those for whom conversation was still an accredited pursuit . " London ! " said Miss Moon , attaching the word to herself as she might hook another trinket to the polyglot baubles at her wrist . She was still leaning forward , partially screening the second Californian , a sullenly handsome woman of about the same age , who had acknowledged Jane with a single dead-pan , dark blink , returning to brood behind a lean brown hand afire with one astounding jewel . " Where did you live when you were in London ? I had the loveliest flat  --  on Hay Hill . " " Oh , Pimlico , Chelsea , " said Jane . " But most of the time with friends in the Middle Temple , " she added demurely . Miss Moon looked doubtfully , then shrewdly at the two British women , suspecting that her own Mayfair-tempered armor might have been pierced in some recondite way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hulme . " But how  --  how delightful ! " But " How amazing " was what she had begun to say . She and Mrs. Wigham exchanged glances . The Americans ; they are everywhere . One has grown used , in the last fifty years , to their heiresses unlocking our dukedoms . But now , even into our sanctuaries they fall , topside up on their incredibly neat , unlineaged legs . Even into the Middle Temple have they fallen , blunt and indiscriminate as the bombs . " You 've just come down from Florence , have you not ? " said Mrs. Wigham . " Ah . . . Florence . I shall not manage it this time , " said Miss Hulme . Over her simple , elderly-sweet profile there passedp126that basking glaze which , at the mention of Florence , crept over the faces of all Londoners old enough to remember the days before the pound-sterling travel restrictions  --  a moment 's Zoroastrian magic , sluicing through fog . " Florence ! " said Miss Moon . " I 've been up there for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 're all mad for Italy on the Coast , you know . " " The Coast ? " said Miss Hulme . " The West Coast of America , Enid , " said Mrs. Wigham . " Well , " said Miss Moon . " I was getting some simply marvelousstuff for my people when Mira here wired me from Garmisch , insisting that I come and stand by her in Rome . She gets so bored , you know  --  where there 's no skiing . " Mira , impassive , blinked once , an animal pricking slightly to the mention of its name . It was enough of a movement to refract the stone that studded her hand like a king 's seal . This then was the wife of that California magnate who perhaps had caught an imported starlet as she rose , or had been caught by her as she faded . Under its wiry , black karakul hair , this was a face that had never been personal enough for real beauty perhapsand was now a little too worn for lushness . But , shortnosedand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which did well with pictures and with men , which one saw now and then framed in marabou on little girls sitting like spoiled goddesses next to their mothers on the East Bronx train . She wore a coat clipped by couturier scissors but dusty , even dirty , and her scuffed sandals showed a split in one sole . Visiting people of no importance to her , she had abjured even conventional grooming , but the seedlets that hung from her ears had an ineffable grape-bloom and were , Jane saw suddenly , black pearls . It was a pity that Mrs. Wigham , obviously not one for the nuances of dress , might not know how subtly she was being insulted . For this woman was dressed , in a way that the Miss Moons would never dare , withp127the down-at-the-heel effrontery of the woman who , even in her bath , wears a diamond as big as the Ritz . " Rome has its attractions , " said Mrs. Wigham . " But I fear skiing is not one of them . " " Rome ! " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now it 's got it all over poor Paris . Sixteen times she 's crossed , and this is the first time anybody 's been able to drag her here . " " More tea ? " said Mrs. Wigham to Mira . " She hates tea , " said Miss Moon . Again Mira blinked , and this time it was as if she had twitched a ridge of skin to remove a fly . " When she 's skiing she wo n't even smoke . She 's marvelous at it . Dedicated . " She turned to shake her head at Mira , to look enviously at the body , still good , still lithe , that moved now , with the humility of the admired , in its rattan chair . SuddenlyMira took out a mirror and stared at it intensely , moving one hand around her eye sockets . Her face pursed in a spasm of regret . She put the mirror away . " Tarrible for the skin , " she said . " What . . . tea ? " said Miss Hulme . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , " said Miss Moon . " But she will do it . " And leaning forward , they could all see the white mask left by the goggles and , radiating through it , the lines of strain , flash burns from the agony of the sport . " But faces are more interesting as they gather life-lines , do n't you think ? " said Miss Hulme . Mira stared , unflickering , into space . Then she stood up , flinging out a hip , in a voiceless sex-contempt for women whom nature had not permitted to know what else a face may gather . She spoke , apparently to Miss Moon . " They have ordered that cab yet ? You know I have a date at six-thirty . " From Mrs. Wigham 's flush it was clear that " they " had been " she , " but her face retained its smile with only a slight shift , as if she had quickly substituted a spare . " Giuseppe is ringing about now , I should imagine . One does n't order any/thing ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have our sense of promptness . Miss Moon will have found all this out , I fancy . " The rapid flutter of her tongue was meant to imply that she had perceived rudeness and risen above it , but now it was she , Jane thought , who wasted a nuance . " I alwess like to rest before a date , " said Mira . The word " date " seemed to stir her to an anticipatory sleekness . She stretched a long leg in front of her , reared her chin and bosom . Then , uneasily , her fingers returned to explore her eye sockets , as if she were learning an unwelcome Braille . Not once had she looked at anyone directly . Jane had never seen a woman whom it was possible to observe so indiscreetly , without danger of the counterglance , the sudden swerve of rapport . " Mira 's husband phones her every night , " said Miss Moon . " Think of it ! " Behind the great , clear wings of her glasses she appraised the other women , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night she 's been away ! All the way from Beverly Hills ! " " Indeed ! " said Mrs. Wigham , who was the friend of more than one dexterous marchesa and had looked on Mussolini 's paramour hanging wry-mouthed in the public square . She rose . " Let us take a look at the garden until the cab arrives , " she said firmly . " I must show you our irrigation system . It 's quite unique . " " Ah yes , how lovely , " said Miss Hulme , rising also . " I hope to persuade your Giuseppe to sell me an oleander . I must have a present for my little Signorina Necci before I leave for home . " " No ! " said Mira . She kicked one shoe against a chair leg , dislodging some gravel from the sole . " I must be back at the hotel at six ! " But Mrs. Wigham had already handed Miss Hulme her cane . " Oh , yes , " she murmured . " Giuseppe has developed a very good nursery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thep129Vague smoke of her chitchat and a guerrilla flanking of Miss Hulme 's cane , the three Americans found themselves maneuveredoff the terrace , onto a path that meandered far and bournless into the flat surrounding field . It was a narrow path , hardly more than a rut in the yellow earth , hedged by currant bushes hair-do high and by low clouds of European daisies , their delicate nets set at nylon level , their perfect , flock-pattern faces , scratchier than in Botticelli , tipped ingenuously toward the sun . Miss Hulme headed the line , and her progress was slow . Her cane probed ; her enthusiasm , inflectedwith the remorseless lilt of solfege , paused at each planting . Behind her , Mira stumped , taking a step from the hip , when she was able . Miss Moon followed , placing each spike heel with safari decision , turning to flash encouragement to Mrs. Wigham and Jane . Moving thus crabwise , she was still able to give them a precisof herself . Hearing Jane tell Mrs. Wigham that she had two boys in school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ housewife herself . " Married to a script-writer , " she said . " Years and years of never using my mind ! " Then she had chanced to make some suggestions on a script and it had turned out that she was a born natural . " Ah , then you are one of those writer-teams , " said Mrs. Wigham . But it seemed that Miss Moon had ditched the husband  --  who had not been a natural . She had been in pictures ever since . The work she was doing now was really a luxury of the intellect that she had had to allow herself at last . For , said Miss Moon , whackingviciously at an artichoke plant that had caught her skirt on a spire , her mind was having its revenge for all those fallow years . It had become an instrument that gave her no rest . " Take Mira , " she said . Ahead Mira , face lowered as if to butt , breathed mutinously near Miss Hulme . " There 's a girl who knows four languages . And one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do is ski like mad and dance all night . Never reads a book or uses her mind . " Mrs. Wigham peered watchfully at Mira , so very near , so extremely close to Miss Hulme . " Sounds frightfully nice , " she said . " Do n't you think so , Mrs. Bowman ? " " Yes , indeed I do , " said Jane . " Well , of course , she goes in for domesticity like mad at home . " Miss Moon 's tone was huffy . " Her husband 's a great stickler for maturity . Everybody is , with us . " Suddenly the path ended abruptly and they found themselves in front of a large , dirty green pool , the path having led them to the front of the house . " Dear me , " said Mrs. Wigham . " You have left us so far behind . " She hurried toward the two women ahead at the brink of the pool , and it was thus impossible to say to whom she had addressed this last . Slipping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an explanation of the pool as a vestige of the great hydraulic systems of antiquity ; waving a brisk hand , she displayed the horizon , on whose line one might just see , or imagine , the worn arches of the aqueducts , marching with ruined step toward classical Rome . Mira gazed morosely at a stone faun that reared from the center of the pool and made a modest return of water to it on a basic principle . She inhaled ominously in her throat , so that one saw the fine , black ciliar fur of her nostrils . " Francine . Here is not yet that cab . " A white-jacketed servingman came from the house , a Maltese cat nosing between his legs . Mrs. Wigham questioned him in Italian . He spread his hands . Mrs. Wigham sighed and took out a handkerchief . Dabbing her lips with it , as if to blot them free of the hopelessly sweet jelly of Italian , she turned to Mira . " It will take a little time . Meanwhile . . . perhaps you 'd like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we ? " said Jane , with the smoothness of the touristp131who knows the rates of exchange . She wondered whether the others knew that they were being asked if they wished to wash their hands . At that moment the cat , rubbing against Mrs. Wigham 's legs , slid also against Mira 's . With an electric recoil , Mira screamed and kicked it . The cat , flung several paces , humped and spat . Giuseppe , his mouth open , ran forward and picked it up in his arms . Mrs. Wigham , immobile , used the handkerchief again to press her lips together . But it was too much for Miss Hulme , who rose telescopic in her suddenly military woollens , her hat a shako , her cheeks a murderous pink . " Really , " she said , " but really this can not be b  --  ! " Her fist rose , the fist with the cane . Ah , thought Jane . She is . She is going to . The cane came down , an inch into the ground , missing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment 's silence . For Jane it was a moment of the deepest overtone , that ecstasy of the traveler who realizes that for once he is looking at what he came for . In a moment of almost alcoholic percipience she saw all the inward threads of the mise en scene ; she saw the Reuters world of Mrs. Wigham , with a fringe of Vatican red ; she saw the metrogoldenshine of California knocked against the Bayswater Road ; down at the bottom she saw even her own little East Coast eye . And now , it seemed almost as if Mira were going to make apology . Her head dropped to one side , her shoulder moved circularly , as if it wished to rub against Mrs. Wigham as had the cat . " I hate them , " she said . " On the plane a woman have one in a box , and it claw me from hip to thigh . " She bent and peeled her skirt upward to the waist , extending the thigh as a queen might her hand at levee . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Behind Mrs. Wigham , Giuseppe stared with interest over the head of the cat . Mrs. Wigham moved indefinably , and Giuseppep132retired in haste , leaving the door open behind him . Since she had not turned her head , her manner too had its touch of the royal . " Do let us go in , " she said . " Cyril and James will have got back from their walk . They will be so delighted to meet you . And perhaps you would sing for us . Your friend tells us you have a charming voice . " Mira dropped her skirt down . " Do , " said Miss Hulme , rallying , although her hat retained its outrage . She paused to right it , to make amends . " A little Purcell , perhaps . I do so love the old madrigals . Or a ballad ? " Mira swung her head suspiciously to one side . She thinks she is being chivied , thought Jane . Or like an animal that must be persuaded it has not behaved badly . Mrs. Wigham moved the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond , recognizing the tone of the afternoon that might have been had she and Mrs. Wigham been alone . Tables confused under books , worn couches blotted with pillowsand stained with periodicals , all the familiar droppings of the intellect , in the international sitting room of the mind . From an unseen corner came the sounds of gentlemen . Mira stirred unexpectedly . " All right , I will sing . " Her head rose , in the diva 's pause . " I will sing  --  Bhramss ' Lullaby . " She advanced for entry , and Mrs. Wigham and Miss Hulme moved politely aside . She bent her head . " It is not needful , " she said , almost jovial , and it seemed she was awkwardly attempting a joke . " It is not needful to wait for me because I am the star . " And , as mutely , they all turned to follow her in , there at last was the cab . Mira crossed to it without ceremony , leaving their farewells to Miss Moon . " Yes , perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought it wise to share the cab . " We must have our chat another time . " As the cab door closed , she leaned across Jane , to the others . " Cyril will be desolute not to have met you . And I have so enjoyed our afternoon . " And from her smile ,  |p133wide  as a salmon 's , as the cab drove off , it appeared that he would , that she had . They rode down through Trastevere in silence . A darkness invested the cab , as if they rode through the white , siestastrickenstreets on the black , plangent core of Mira 's impatience . As they crossed the Tiber she muttered , " I like to rest before a date ! " and Miss Moon replied , " Well , you are resting . In the cab , " in that reasonable tone , half-toady , halfgoverness , which made Jane wonder at the exact terms of her standing by Mira in Rome . As they rounded the immense white sugar loaf of the Victor Emanuel monument , Miss Moon remarked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was kept in its cage . Because of Romulus and Remus  --  of course , they knew that story ? Mira shook her head , intent on twisting her ring in time to the wheels . Miss Moon told the story of Romulus and Remus . " And so , ever since , " she concluded , " they keep a wolf , a female wolf , in a cage in the middleof Rome . " " What you mean a wolf ! " Mira turned from the window . She stopped twisting the ring . That 's what gives her such a queer intentness , thought Jane . She only does one thing at a time . " What I said , dear . A real she-wolf , just like the one Romulusand Remus had . In a cage in the heart of Rome . " Mira grunted . " What hearts , these people ! She does not give suck now , yes ? " " Well , of course not ! " said Miss Moon . " It 's just a symbol , dear . And they only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mira . " What a thing ! " " Mira has the dearest little girl at home , " said Miss Moon , as if to explain this tenderness on the part of one who had just kicked a cat . " The dearest little four-and-a-half-year-old girl.  |p134Just  crazy for her mummy . Just pining for her mummy to come home . " Well , no six-o'clock cab will get her there , thought Jane . She rubbed the stone in her pocket with a secret , appeasing touch . Mira ignored this , bristling with some dark , libertarian sympathythat was as powerful as had been her impatience . " Crazy people ! " she said . " What a thing ! " When the cab drew up at the entrance of the Excelsior , she stood by unheeding while Miss Moon , over Jane 's protest and with the alertness of a lady in waiting , paid the very large fare . As they stood on the steps twilight fawned upon them , tangling their lashes with yellow , and from inside the hotel they heard , like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening pursuits . Mira blinked , breathing hard . " What a thing ! " she said , deep in her throat , before she turned and went inside . " What a thing , to keep a wolf in a cage ! " Left together on the steps of the gleaming entrance , Miss Moon and Jane each turned , hand held out , ready to make off . For there was nothing , each said to herself with an oblique inward glance , certainly nothing that they had in common . " Well  --  " said Miss Moon . " So pleased  --  " said Jane . But it was that perilously soft hour of all great cities in the spring , when the evening rises to a sound like the tearing of silk and it is better not to be alone , to have some plan . " Care to join me in a drink ? " said Miss Moon . " Well  --  perhaps just one , " said Jane . I ca n't refuse , she told herself . I must buy her a drink , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time for the eight o'clock sitting at the pensione . And after that I can sit on the balcony , on the pretty side , the Pincio side , and write letters home . Or I can ask that nice girl at the next table to have a granite di calf e at Doney 's . " Shall we go next door to the Fiore ? " she said . " Or if you'dp135like a walk  --  perhaps the Cafe Greco ? " She was faintly proud of knowing both . " Oh , no , let 's go in here , " said Miss Moon . As they entered the Excelsior her face brightened . " All California 's here on spring location , " she said , sotto voce , as she led Jane to a table near the door of the huge lounge , and they sat down . " And this is the bar that gets the play . " At the bar itself there was only a solitary young man , his tall legs wrapped around the bar stool , his blond , " clean-cut American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his tweed back turned away from the groups settled here and there in cushioned niches , as if he uncomfortably knew none of them . It was clear that these others all knew , or knew of , each other . Not that everyone talked to everyone else . But as new people entered conversations were arrested : foursomes spoke deeply among themselves but their glances were asymmetric , and as couples rose , scattering nods , and strode from the arena , a buzz formed behind them . And to the careful watcher , there was still another unity . The women  --  the wives , that is , for most left hands bore a shock of light  --  were not all young , but they were younger . The men were beautifully textured as puddings in their minimizing pin-stripe cases , and their cheeks were flanks freshly pummeled by the steam bath , but their wives were their daughters . Opposite them the women sat narrow in luminous sheaths , their shoulders soft explosions of fur , their faces unclenching and closing , automatic as fans . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke out of the side of her mouth . She raised her sharp chin with a brilliant smile that faded as it was doubtfully returned . Quickly she redistributed the smile to one far corner , waved briefly to another . She took a vengeful sip of her Martini . " Believe it or not  --  she used to do my nails at Marshall Field 's . " The Martini sank farther , and she leaned back with a sigh . " Pretty soonp136I 'll have to go upstairs and pound that typewriter . I simply have to lock myself in . " " Oh , you 're staying here ? " said Jane . " Well , no , but I have a place to work in Mira 's suite . She gets in a dreadful state when there 's no  --  when she gets bored . And I like to be where the play is , you never know . " One of the chattering groups strolled by , and Miss Moon leaned brightly toward Jane , speaking very distinctly . " For instance , I was just going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of Decca . Why do a book , he says , there 's more money in lyrics , and they 're shorter . So I do , and it turns out I 'm a natural . " The group passed . She waved to the waiter for another drink . " So then , " she said in a lower tone , " so then what does he do but go and die on me , in a cab on the way to work . With my stuff in his briefcase , right there in the cab . " " Oh , my , " said Jane . In her childhood she had been much at the mercy of a little girl who was always wanting to play house . Now you just be old Mrs. Brown , Jane , and I 'll be Elise Harper , just married , and come to tea . " So I do a narrative , weave all the stuff together , and almost sell Dolin and Markova on the idea of a ballet . " She took a sip of the second Martini @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dear , " said Jane . It struck her that she was still not a very good Mrs. Brown . Behind Miss Moon , at some distance , there was a mirror in which Jane could just see herself  --  rather unvarnished , tailored and small against all this princely down . Not quite plain Jane though , she told herself , and not quite yet , she thought , looking her age . At home , when she put on a bare-necked summer cottonand served gin-and-tonic to the sprightlier clique of the faculty , it was often hardly credited that she was the mother of those two enormous boys . " So then , " said Miss Moon heavily , " I 'm at the Park Lane , and who do I bump into but Grofe . Get him for music andp137you 're set for the Festival Hall , everybody says . The English are suckers for Americana . " Behind her own image in the mirror , Jane saw the bent head of the young man . He bit his lip and recrossed his legs , still staring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she thought , like me . It would be nice to talk to him , although the idea was , of course , absurd . That was the worst of being on one 's own too long in a strange country , so far from the base of affections that steadied one at home . One dried up without some personal emotion ; that was all it was . One could not forever be a lens . And at certain hours of the day one found oneself lingering with anyone , as she lingered here . " Surely you know who Grofe is , " said Miss Moon . " Oh , yes , of course , " said Jane . " Philip Morris . I mean the commercial . And is n't he Vladimir Dukelsky for classical  --  oh , no , of course not  --  that 's Vernon Duke . " She thinks me an idiot , she thought , and I am to sit on here , waiting to hear how it was they did n't get Grofe . For from the grim , antiphonal way Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had n't . " So then , " said Miss Moon , but she interrupted herself to twinkle a hand at someone who passed , to murmur an indistinctname . I 'll grab the check and go now , thought Jane . For it was no longer funny to watch Miss Moon . It was like seeing those women who hovered secretly at other women 's dressing tables , to spray themselves avidly and cheaply with another person 's scent . I 'll take the check and go now . She glanced at her watch . It was seven , that hour here when even the windows of pensione bedrooms were violet frames that turned one inside to say Look ! to the empty room , to lie face downward , ears stopped against the bell-shake of evening , and say Listen ! to the vacant bed . The hour when an experienced traveler knows better thanp138to corner himself there . The hour when the lens turns upon oneself . " And . . . so then ? " said Jane . But Miss Moon was looking elsewhere again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unrehearsed expression that Jane looked around too . It was Mira , standing at the entrance . Groomed now for people of importance , she had made herself , as women did , to be as like them as possible . Her dress was luminous too , cut with pale cleverness to conceal where it could no longer insist , and she stood encircled in a huge riband of fur . She looked sleeker and , in a powdery way , older . Perhapsshe had seen this in some mirror before leaving , for now she reached up uncertainly and rumpled her tamed hair , as if to declare the girl she had been against the woman she was . She walked forward with a mannequin 's glide , her smile full for the room , then turned her back to it and , with an eager , a crescent leaning , slipped her hand through the arm of the young man at the bar . He looked up , then stood up , and on his face , handsomer even than in profile , one saw the snow marks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white circles on Mira 's face were fretted like rose windows , his were still smooth . He was about thirty , that age when , with Americans , one often glimpses the young man looking through the palings of the man , and in his look , lightened with relief but somehow hangdog , one caught this now . As he and Mira left the bar , Mira saw the two women , Jane and Miss Moon . For the first time she really saw them . She looked directly into their eyes and she smiled . Then she and the young man passed by them , walking slowly down the long room , and although Mira , nodding here and there with narrowed eyes , clung softly and proudly to the crook of his arm , it seemed almost that he was paraded on hers . A buzz formed behind them . " She 's a fool . " Miss Moon breathed this to herself . Behindp139her glasses her eyes were bright and fixed . " It 'll be all over the Coast in twenty-four hours . " Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the room . The young man 's face was warm . Mira was still faintly smiling , and although this time the smile , fixed on the door , was for neither of the two women , to Jane , trembling suddenly in her tailored suit with a shock that was bitter and sororal , it came as if it was . Almost a grimace , it showed its teeth to an invisible mirror , denying with the lips the secret lines that a body must gather  --  the crow 's feet of the armpit , the dented apple of the belly , the mapped crease , fine leather too long folded , that forms between the breasts . As Mira passed her on the arm of the young man , her scent remained for a moment behind . It rested on Jane as if it were her own . At the door , Mira and the young man paused . A rush of lilac came to them from the outside , and Mira 's fur slid from shoulder to waist , a dropped calyx . The young man replaced it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a beautiful fur , manipulable as smoke . Before the arts of the furrier had dappledit , it might have been just the color of wolf . Left together by the flicking of the door , the two women stared at one another . " Traveling alone ? " said Miss Moon . Jane nodded . " Divorced too ? " " No , " said Jane . " I 'm a widow . " Her head lifted . " I have two boys . " Miss Moon seemed not to have heard this last . " Care to  --  join forces for dinner ? " No , thought Jane . Do n't settle for anybody 's company . As she does . As she has . Not yet . She gazed past Miss Moon , saw herself in the mirror , and looked quickly away . " Thanks , " she said , and her voice was kind . " I 'm afraid . . . I have work to do too . "  | " Oh , you work , " said Miss Moon eagerly . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Jane . " In a university . " I teach , an echo said inside her , and of course at home I have the two boys . And suddenlythe echo , her breath , something , rammed itself hard against her chest , inside . Not enough , it said , beating behind the mapped crease between her breasts . Not enough . What a thing , it said , crying . What a thing ! " Well , back to the salt mines for us , eh ? " said Miss Moon . Her voice was matey , unbearable . Just as if she too had smelled the scent , had heard the thing crying . As if she knew too that Jane , staring into the big , winged glasses , could see the two poor eyes beating against the glass . And now they stood up quickly , gathered their purses and signaled for the waiter . When he came , they paid him with a dispatch unusual to women , and the lire notes left lying in his saucer were large enough for anybody here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For now , each said to herself , the other 's company was no longer to be borne . No , it was not to be borne . Not now . Now that they both knew what it was they had in common.  |p143WHEN  I was in high school , my best friend for almost a year was another boy of about the same age by the name of Werner Hauser , who disappeared from his home one night and never came back . I am reminded of him indirectly sometimes , in a place like Luchow 's or Cavanagh'sor Hans Jaeger 's , when I am waited on by one of those rachitic-looking German waiters with narrow features , faded hair , and bad teeth , who serve one with an omniscience vergingon contempt . Then I wonder whether Mr. Hauser , Werner 's father , ever got his own restaurant . I am never remindeddirectly of Werner by anybody , because I have n't the slightest idea what he may have become , wherever he is . As for Mrs. Hauser , Werner 's mother  --  she was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all like her , and I do n't expect to . Although Werner and I went to the same high school , like all the boys in the neighborhood except the dummies who had to go to trade school or the smart alecks who were picked for Townsend Harris , we were really friends because both our fainilieshad back apartments in the same house on Hamilton Terrace , a street which angled up a hill off Broadway and had nothing else very terrace-like about it , except that its five-story tan apartment buildings had no store fronts on the ground floors . Nowadays that part of Washington Heights is almost all Puerto Rican , but in those days nobody in particular lived around there . My parents had moved there supposedly because it was a little nearer to their jobs in the Seventh Avenue gar/ment district than the Bronx had been  --  my father worked in the fur district on Twenty-eighth Street , and my mother still got work as a finisher when the season was on  --  but actually they had come on the insistence of my Aunt Luba @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's , of whom she was exceptionallyfond and could not go a day without seeing . When Luba talked about the Heights being higher-class than the Bronx , my parents got very annoyed . Like a lot of the garment workers of that day they were members of the Socialist Labor Party , although they no longer worked very hard at it . Occasionally , still , of an evening , after my father had gotten all worked up playing the violin with two or three of his cronies in the chamber music sessions that he loved , there would be a vibrant discussion over the cold cuts , with my mother , flushed and gay , putting in a sharp retort now and then as she handed round the wine ; then too my older sister had been named after Ibsen 's Nora  --  which sounded pretty damn funny with a name like Rosenbloom  --  and of course nobody in the family ever went to a synagogue . That 's about all their radicalism had amounted to . My younger sister was named Carol . The Hausers had been in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the regular moving day , October first ; later a neighbor told my mother that they had gotten September rentfreeas a month 's concession on a year 's lease  --  a practice which only became common in the next few years of the depression , and , as I heard my mother say , a neater trick than the Rosenblooms would ever think of . Shortly after they came , a sign was put up to the left of the house entrance  --  Mrs. Hauser had argued down the landlord on this too . The sign said Erna Hauser . Weddings . Receptions . Parties , and maybe the landlord was mollified after he saw it . It was black enamel and gold leaf under glass , and about twice the size of thep145dentist 's . When I got to know Werner , at the time of those first frank questions with which boys place one another , he told me that ever since he and his mother had been sent for to come from Germany five years before , the family had been living in Yorkville in a furnished " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had occupied during the eight years he had been in the United States alone . Now Mrs. Hauser would have her own kitchen and a place to receive her clientele , mostly ladies from the well-to-do Jewish families of the upper West Side , for whom she had hitherto " helped out " at parties and dinners in their homes . From now on she would no longer " help out "  --  she would cater . Most of what I learned about Werner , though , I did n't learn from Werner . He would answer a question readily enough , but very precisely , very much within the limits of the question , and no overtones thrown in . I guess I learned about him because he was my friend , by sucking it out of the air the way kids do , during the times I was in his house before he was forbidden to hang around with me , and during the dozens of times before and after , when he sneaked up to our place . He was at our place as often as he could get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken him for one of the family , since he was blond and short-featured , like my mother and me . He was a head taller than me , though , with a good build on him that was surprising if you had already seen his father 's sunken , nutcracker face and bent-kneed waiter 's shuffle . It was n't that he had the special quiet of the very stupid or the very smart , or that he had any language difficulty ; he spoke English as well as I did and got mostly nineties at school , where he made no bones about plugging hard and was held up as an example because he had only been in the country five years . It was just that he had almost no informal conversation . Because of this I never felt very close to him , even when we talked sex or smoked on the sly , and sometimes Ip146had an uneasy feeling because I could n't tell whether he was stupid or smart . I suppose we were friends mostly out of convenience , the way boys in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposite sides of the small circular rear court of the building ; by opening his bedroom window and our dining - room window we could shout to each other to come over , or to meet out in front . I could , that is , although my mother used to grumble about acting up like riffraff . He was not allowed to ; once , even before the edict , I saw the window shut down hard on his shoulders by someone from behind . After the edict we used to raise the windows very slightly and whistle . Even then , I never felt really close to him until the day after he was gone . Saturday mornings , when I was that age , seemed to have a special glow ; surely there must have been rainy ones , but I remember them all in a powerful golden light , spattered with the gabble of the vegetable men as they sparred with women at the open stalls outside their stores , and ringing with the loud , pre-Sunday clang of the ash cans as the garbage collectors hoisted them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm smell of settling ash . It was a Saturday morning when I first went up to the Hausers ' , to see if Werner could get off to take the Dyckman Ferry with me for a hike along the Palisades . I already knew that he helped his mother with deliveries evenings and afternoons after school , but I had not yet learned how prescribed all his hours were . The hall door of the Hauser apartment was open a crack ; through it came a yeasty current as strong as a bakery 's . I flicked the bell . " Come , " said a firm , nasal voice . Or perhaps the word was " Komm . " I was never to hear Mrs. Hauser speak English exceptonce , when Werner and I , who had not heard her come in , walked through the parlor where she was dealing with a lady who had come about a daughter 's wedding . That was the occasion at which I saw her smile  --  at the lady  --  a fixedp147grimace which dusted lightly over the neat surface of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cakes . I walked in , almost directly into the kitchen . It was very like ours , small and badly lighted , but it had two stoves . Rows of copper molds and pans of all shapes hung on the walls . One graduated row was all of Bund pans , like one my mother had , but it was the first time I had seen utensils of copper , or seen them hung on walls . Supplies , everything was in rows ; nothing wandered or went askew in that kitchen ; even its choke-sweet odor had no domestic vagary about it , but clamped the room in a hot , professional pall . Werner and his mother , bent over opposite ends of a cloth-covered table , were carefully stretching at a large plaque of strudel dough which almost covered its surface . Both of them glanced up briefly and bent their heads again ; the making of strudel is the most intense and delicate of operations , in which the last stretching of the dough , alreadyrolled and pulled to tissue thinness , is done on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , feathery tension . I held my breath and watched . Luba and my mother made strudel about once a year , in an atmosphere of confused merriment and operatic anguish when the dough broke . As I watched , red crept up on Werner 's face . Almost opposite me , Mrs. Hauser bent and rose , angularly deft , but without grace . I had expected some meaty-armed Hausfrau trundling an ample bosom smeared with flour ; here was the virginal silhouette of a governess , black and busked  --  a dressmaker 's form collared in lace . From the side , her face had a thin economy , a handsomeness that had meagered and was further strained by the sparse hair spicked back in a pale bun . Suddenly she straightened . The paste had reached the edges of the cloth ; in a few whisked motions it was dabbed with butter , filled , rolled , cut , and done . She brushed her hands together , blew on the spotless front of her dress , and faced me.  |p148She  was not handsome at all . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , her eyes protruded slightly with a lashless , committed stare , and the coinsliaped mouth was too near the nose . She wore no make-up , and her face had the triumphantneatness of the woman who does not ; next to it Luba 's and my mother 's would have looked vital , but messy . Her skin was too bloodless though , and her lips and the nails of her floured hands were tinged with lavender , almost stonecolored , as if she suffered from some attenuation of the heart . Werner mumbled out my first name , and I mumbled back my errand . Mrs. Hauser , holding her hands lightly in front of her , still gave me her stare , but it was to Werner that she spoke at last . " Sag ihin nein , " she said , and turning on her heel , she left the room , still holding away from her dress the hands with the stone-colored nails . After that , I knew enough not to go to Werner 's unless he asked me to , usually on evenings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he worked , and Mrs. Hauser had an engagement , or on Sundays , when she had an especially fancy wedding and Mr. Hauser , dressed in his waiter 's garb , went along to help her serve . I never got used to the way their apartment looked , compared with the way it smelled . When there was no cooking going on , and the hot fumes had a chance to separate and wander , then it was filled , furnished with enticing suggestions of cinnamon , vanilla , and anise , and the wonderful , warm caraway scent of little pastries stuffed with hot forcemeat  --  a specialty of Mrs. I-Iauser 's , of which her customers could never get enough . Standing outside the door , I used to think it smelled the way the house in Hansel and Gretel looked , in the opera to which my parents had taken me years before  --  a house from whose cornices and lintels onep149might break off a piece and find one 's mouth full of marzipan , an aerie promising happy troupes of children feasting within , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the four dim rooms , curtainless except for the blinds which the landlord supplied  --  one yellow , one dark green to a window  --  had an almost incredible lack of traces of personal occupancy , even after one knew that the Hausers never thought of the place as anything but temporary . It was furnished with a bleak minimum of tables and chairs like those in hired halls . Mrs. Hauser had procured everything from a restaurant supply house , all except the beds , which were little more than cots , and wore hard white cotton spreads of the kind seen in hotels . Here , in the bedrooms , some of the secondhandsurfaces were protected with doilies , on which a few European family photographs had been placed . Years later , when I was staying in the luxurious house of a family which had managed to keep on its servants in the old-fashioned way , stumbling inadvertently into the servants ' wing , one morning , I came upon a room that reminded me instantly of the IIausers ' , although even its dresser had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letters . Even so , when Werner and I hung around awhile in his room , we never sat on the drill-neat bed . Usually we sat on the floor and leaned back against the bed . Except for the times we did our homework together , we either just talked or exchanged the contents of our pockets , for it was the kind of house in which there was simply nothing to do . Once or twice we smoked cigarettes there , carefully airing the room and chewing soda-mints afterward . I supplied both the cigarettes and the soda-mints , since it was an understood thing that Werner never had any money of his own ; the considerable work he did for his mother was " for the business . " The rows of cakes , frilled cookies , and tiny quenelles that we sometimes passed , goingp150through the kitchen , were for the business too . I never got anything to eat there . Usually , after we had been there a short while , Werner , wriggling his shoulders sheepishly , would say , " Let 's go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him up . I knew why Werner liked to be there , of course , why he could not keep from coming even after Mrs. Hauser had forbidden it . It may sound naive to say so in this day and age , but we were an awfully happy family . We really were . And I never realized it more strongly than during the times I used to watch Werner Hauser up there . I guess the best way I can explain the kind of family we were is to say that , although I was the only nonmusical one in a family that practically lived for music , I never felt criticized or left out . My father , although he tired quickly because of a shoulder broken when he was a boy and never properly healed , was the best musician , with faultless pitch and a concertmeister'smemory for repertoire . Nora played the cello with a beautiful tone , although she would n't work for accuracy , and Carol could already play several wind instruments ; it was a sight to watch that stringy kid of ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Both Luba and my mother had had excellent training in piano , and sang even better than they played , although Luba would never concede to my father that she occasionally flatted . My mother , contrarily , tended to sing sharp , which so fitted her mock-acid ways that my father made endless plays on words about it . " Someday , " he would add , striking his forehead with his fist , " I am going to find a woman who sings exactly in the middle ; then I will steal the company 's payroll , and take her to live at The Breakers in Atlantic City ! " " Mir nix , dir nix , " my mother would answer . " And what kind of music would be at The Breakers ? " " A string quartet , " Luba would shout , " with a visiting ac/cordion for the weekends ! " Then the three of them would pound each other in laughter over the latest " visiting accordion " who had been to our house . All kinds of people were attracted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the professionalquality of the music they heard there , and were forever introducing a protege whom they had touted beforehand . Whenever these turned out to be violinists who had never heard of the Beethoven Quartets , or pianists who had progressed as far as a bravura rendition of the " Revolutionary Etude , " our secret name for them was " a visiting accordion . " Not even Carol was ever rude to any of these though ; the musical part of the evening simply ended rather earlier than usual , and dissolved into that welter of sociable eating and talkingwhich we all loved . When I say I was n't musical , I do n't mean I did n't know music or love it  --  no one in that family could help it  --  I could reproduce it and identify it quite accuratelyin my head , but I just could n't make it with my hands or my voice . It had long ago been settled upon that I was the historian , the listener , the critic . " Ask Mr. Huneker here , " my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Mr. Gilman , or Mrs. Downes , according to whatever commentatorhe had been reading ) . Sometimes , when in reading new music the group achieved a dissonance that harrowed him , he would turn on me : " We should all be like this one  --  Paganini today  --  Hoffman tomorrow  --  and all safe upstairs in the head . " But the teasing took me in ; it never left me out . That 's what happened to Werner at our house . They took him in too . We had our bad times of course . Often my father 's suppertimeaccounts of his day on Seventh Avenue , usually reported with a deft , comedian 's touch , turned to bitter invective , or were not forthcoming at all . Then we knew that the mood in which he regretted a life spent among values he despised had stolen over him , or else the money question was coming up again , and we ate in silence . Luba and my mother quarreledp152with the violence of people who differ and can not live without one another ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage of which pervaded the house as recognizablyas what was simmering on the stove . My sister Nora , eighteen and beautiful , was having trouble with both these contingencies ; each month , just before her periods , she filled the house with a richly alternating brooding and hysteria that set us all to slamming doors and leaving the house . A saint could n't have lived with it . And Carol and I bickered , and had our pint-size troubles too . I can see how we must have seemed to Werner though . No matter what was going on , our house had a kind of ruddiness and satisfaction about it . Partly its attraction was because there was always something going on . If anyone had asked me about the state of my innards in regard to my family , I guess I would have said that I felt full . Not full of life , or happiness , or riches , or any of those tiddly phrases . Just chock full . I would have said this , most likely , because , as I watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our family , watched him being stuffed by my mother , twitted by my father , saw him almost court being ignored by Nora and annoyed by Carol , I had the awful but persistent fancy that he must be absolutely hollow inside . Literally hollow , I mean . I could see them , his insides  --  as bleak as the apartment where his parents were either oppressively absent or oppressively around , and scattered with a few rag-tag doilies of feeling that had almost no reason to be there . There would be nothing inside him to make a feeling out of , unless it were the strong , tidal perfume of the goodies that were meant for the business . One evening at the beginning of that summer , Werner was with us when my father scooped us all up and took us to the concert at the Stadium , only a few minutes ' walk from home . We went often to those concerts , although , as everyone knows ,  |p153o|pen-air  music can rarely have the finish of the concert hall . But there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the open air . It is not only the sight of thousands of ordinary faces , tranced and quiet in a celebration of the unreal . It is because the music , even while it is clogged and drowned now and then by the rusty noises of the world outside the wall , is not contaminated by them ; even while it states that beauty and the world are irreconcilable , it persists in a frail suggestion that the beauty abides . Werner , at his first concert , sat straight-backed on one of the straw mats my father had rented for us , taking in the fragments of talk milling around us , with the alertness of a person at a dinner who watches how his neighbor selects his silver . During the first half , when an ambulance siren , combined with the grinding of the trolleys on Amsterdam Avenue , clouded over a pianissimo , he winced carefully , like some of those around him . But during the second half , which ended with the Beethoven Fifth , when a dirigible stealing overhead drew a thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sleepy , drained look , did not join them . As we all walked down the hill afterward , Carol began whistling the Andante . As she came to that wonderful breakthroughin the sixteenth measure , Werner took it up in a low , hesitant , but pure whistle , and completed it . Carol stopped whistling , her mouth open , and my father turned his head . No one said anything though , and we kept on walking down the hill . Suddenly Werner whistled again , the repetition of that theme , twenty-three bars from the end , when , instead of descendingto the A flat , it rises at last to the G.My father stopped in his tracks . " You play , Werner ? " Werner shook his head . " Somebody plays at your house ? " " Nein , " said Werner . I do n't think he realized that he had said it in German.  | " How is it you know music ? " Werner rubbed his hand across his eyes . When he spoke , he sounded as if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know it , " he said . In the next few weeks Werner came with us almost every time we went . I did n't know where he got the money , but he paid his own way . Once , when he had n't come to go with us , we met him afterward , loitering at the exit we usually took , and he joined us on the walk home . I think he must have been listening from outside the Stadium wall . He always listened with a ravenous lack of preference . Once he turned to me at the intermission and said with awe , " I could hear them both together . The themes . At the same time . " When I spoke sophomorically of what I did n't like , he used to Iook at me with pity , although at the end of a concert which closed with the " Venusberg , " he turned to me , bewildered , and said . " It is possible not to like it . " I laughed , but I did feel pretty comfortable with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " Venusberg . " Then , one time , he did not come around for over a week , and when I saw him in the street he was definitely avoiding me . I thought of asking why he was sore at me , but then I thought : The hell with it . Anyway , that Sunday morning , as my father and I started out for a walk on Riverside Drive , we met Werner and his mother in the elevator . Mrs. Hauser carried some packages and Werner had two large cartons which he had rested on the floor . It was a tight squeeze , but the two of us got in , and after the door closed my father succeeded in raising his hat to Mrs. Hauser , but got no acknowledgment . My father replaced his hat on his fan-shaped wedge of salt-and-pepper hair . He chewed his lips back and forth thoughtfully under his large , mournful nose , but said nothing . When the door opened , we had to get out first . They passed ahead of us quickly , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Was hab ' ich gesagt ? " she said . " Sie Sind Tilden ! " Anybody who knows Yiddish can understand quite a lot of German too . My father and I walked a long way that day , not on the upper Drive , where the Sunday strollers were , but on those little paths , punctuated with iron street lamps but with a weak hint of country lane about them , where the city petered out into the river . We walked along , not saying much of anything , all the way up to the lighthouse at Inspiration Point . Then we climbed the hill to Broadway , where my father stopped to buy some cold cuts and a cheese cake , and took the subway home . Once , when my father was paying my fare , he let his hand rest on my shoulder before he waved me ahead of him through the turnstile , and once he caught himself whistling something , looked at me quickly , and closed his mouth . I did n't have a chance to recognize what he whistled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rang . Carol ran to answer it ; she was the kind of kid who was always darting to answer the phone or the door , although it was almost never for her . She came back to the table and flounced into her seat . " It 's Werner . We wants to see you . He wo n't come in . " I went to the door . He was n't lounging against the door frame , the way he usually did . He was standing a couple of paces away from it . " Please come for a walk , " he said . He was looking at his shoes . " Gee , why n't you come in ? " I said . " I 'm dead . " " Please , " he said , " I want you please to come for a walk . " I was practically finished eating anyway . I went back to the table , grabbed up a hard roll and some pastrami , and followed him downstairs . Summer in the city affects me the same way as open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them have such a hardp156time . Even when the evening breeze smells of nothing but hot brick , you get the feeling that people are carrying around leaves in their hearts . Werner and I walked down to our usual spot on the river , to a low stone wall , which we jumped , over to a little collection of bushes and some grass , on the other side . It was an open enough spot , but it reacted on us more or less like a private cave ; we never said much of anything till we got there . This time it was up to Werner to speak . I had the sandwich , so I finished that . The electric signs across the river on the Jersey side were already busy . Werner 's face was turned parallel with the river , so that it looked as if the sign that gave the time signal were paying out its letters right out of his mouth . THE TIME IS NOW ... 8:01 . . . Ordinarily I would have called his attention to this effect and changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I did n't . The sign jazzed out something about salad oil , and then paid out another minute . Werner turned his head . " You heard . . . this morning in the elevator ? " I nodded . " Your father heard too ? " I nodded again . He pressed his knuckles against his teeth . His words came through them with a chewed sound . " It is because they are servants , " he said . " Who do you mean ? " " My father and mother . " " You mean . . . they do n't like Jews because they have to work for them sometimes ? " " Maybe , " said Werner , " but it is not what I mean . " " It 's no disgrace , what anybody works at , over here . " I was n't sure I believed this , but it was what one was told . " Besides , they have the business . " Werner turned his back on me , his shoulders humpedp157up against the Palisades . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to face me , the words tumbling out with the torn confiding of the closemouthed . " They do not care about the quality of anything . " His voice lingered on the word . He jerked his head at the Mazola sign . " Butter maybe , instead of lard . But only because it is good for the business . " " Everybody has something wrong with his family , " I muttered . Werner folded his arms almost triumphantly and looked at me . " But we are not a family , " he said . I got up and walked around the little grass plot . The way he had spoken the word quality stayed with me ; it popped into my mind the time in spring when he and I had been sitting near the same old stone wall and two scarlet tanagers lit on it and strutted for a minute against the blue . You are n't supposedto see tanagers in New York City . Sooner or later , though , you 'll see almost everything in New York . You 'll have almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dark shine to it now . It smelled like a packinghousefor fish , but it looked like the melted , dark eyes of a million girls . " I wish we were going up to the country this year , " I said . " I 'd like to be there right now . " " I hate the country ! " Werner said . " That 's where they 're going to have the restaurant . They have almost enough money now . " Then it all came out  --  in a rush . " Come on back , " he said . " They 're out . I want to show you something . " All the way up the hill he talked : how his mother had worked as a housekeeper for a rich merchant after his father had left for America ; how he had always been the child in the basement , allowed to play neither with the town children nor the merchant 's ; how his mother would not agree to come over until his father had saved a certain sum , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would sail . Then , in Yorkville , where they had only taken a larger room because the landlady insisted , they used to walk the garish streets sometimes , listening to the din from the cafes  --  " 1st das nicht ein . . . ? Ja , das ist ein . . . "  --  but never going in for a snack or a glass of beer . " We breathed quiet , " I remember him saying , " so we would not have to use up too much air . " And always , everything was for the restaurant . At Christmastimeand birthdays they did not give each other presents , but bought copper pans , cutlery , equipment for the restaurant . They had their eye on an actual place , on a side road not too far from some of the fancy towns in Jersey ; it was owned by a man whose wife was a cousin of Mrs. Hauser 's . It already had a clientele of connoisseurs who came to eat slowly , to wait reverently in a waft of roasting coffee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smart  --  they knew that Americans would pay the best for the best , and even wait a little long for it , in order to be thought European . But they had let the place get seedy ; they did not have enough discipline for the long , sluggish day before the customers arrived , and they had not Iearned that while the Americans might wait out of snobbishness , they would not do so because the owners were getting drunk in the kitchen . The Hausers would be smarter still . They would serve everything of the best , at a suitably stately pace for such quality , and they would not get drunk in the kitchen . He stopped talking when we got to his door . The whole time , he had n't raised his voice , but had talked on and on in a voice like shavings being rubbed together . His room was dark and full of the cloying smell . He stood in front of the window , not turning the light on , and I saw that he was looking over at our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was the summer radios first really came in . Almostp159everyone had one now . We had n't got one yet , but one of Nora 's boy friends had given her a small table model . There were a couple of them playing now at cross purposes , from differentplaces on the court . " Thursday nights they are broadcasting the concerts , did you know ? " he said softly . " Sometimes someone tunes in on it , and I can hear , if I keep the window open . The echoes are bad . . . and all the other noises . Sometimes , of course , no one tunes it in . " I wondered what he had to show me , and why he did not turn on the light . " Today was my birthday , " he said . " I asked them for a radio , but of course I did not expect it . I am to get working papers . When they leave , I am to leave the high school . " He walked away from the window and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sprang into sharp black and white : the tie disposed on the starched shirt , which lay neatly between the black jacket and pants . That 's what it was . It was a waiter 's suit . " Of course I did not expect it , " he said . " I did not . " It was after this that Werner , when he whistled across the court , started using themes from here and there . Sometimes it was that last little mocking bit from Till Eulenspiegel when Till 's feet kick , sometimes it was the Ho-yo-to-ho from Valkyrie , sometimes the horns from the " Waltz of the Flowers . " It was always something we had heard at the Stadium , something we had heard together . When my father , to whom I had blabbed most of that evening with Werner , heard the whistle , his face would sometimes change red , as if he were holding his breath in anger against someone ; then this would be displaced by the sunk , beaten look he sometimes brought home from Seventh Avenue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said anything to Werner or to me.  |p160The  last night , the night it must have happened , was a Thursday a few weeks later . It was one of those humid nights when the rain just will not come , and even the hair on your head seems too much to carry around with you . We were all sitting in the dining room , brushing limply now and then at our foreheads . Nora was in one of her moods  --  the boy who had given her the radio had not phoned . She had it turned on and sat glowering in front of it , as if she might evoke him from it . My father was standing at the window , looking up at the sky . The court had its usual noises , children crying , a couple of other radios , and the rumble from the streets . Once or twice some kid catcalled from a higher floor , and a light bulb explodedon the alley below . My father leaned forward suddenly , and looked across the court , watching intently . Then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it a moment , and turned it on loud . We all looked at him in surprise . He did n't think much of the thing , and never monkeyed with it . I looked across the court at Werner 's window . I could n't see into its shadows , but it was open . I thought of the look on his face when he met us outside the Stadium walls and of his voice saying , " Sometimes no one tunes it in . " I would have whistled to him , but I could n't have been heard over the music  --  Scheherazade , it was  --  which was sweeping out loud and strong into the uneasy air . My mother whispered a reproach to my father , then took a side look at his face , and subsided . I glanced around at Carol , Nora , all of us sitting there joined together , and for some reason or other I felt sick . It 's the weather , I thought , and wiped my forehead . Then , in the square across the court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to grind down . And then we heard Werner 's voice , high and desperate , louder even than thep161plashing waves of the Princess 's story  --  a long , loud wail . " No ! Please ! Scheherazade is speaking ! " Then there were two figures at the window , and the window was flung up again . My mother clapped her hand against her face , ran over to the radio and turned it down low , and stood bent over with her back against it , her fist to her mouth . So it was that we heard Werner again , his words squeezed out , hoarse , but clear . " Bitte , Mutter . Lass mich horen . Scheherazadespricht . " Then the window came down . The next evening the house was like a hive with what had happened . The Hausers had gone to the police . There had been one really personal thing in their house after all , and Werner had taken it with him . He had taken the whole of the cache in the wall safe , the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around to question me  --  two pleasant enough Dutch uncles who had some idea that Werner might have made a pact with me , or that I could give them some clues as to what had been going on inside him . I could n't tell them much of use . I was n't going to tell them to look over at the Stadium , either outside or in , although for years afterward I myself used to scan the crowds there . And I was n't fool enough to try to explain to them what I had hardly figured out yet myself  --  that nature abhors the vacuums men shape , and sooner or later pushes the hollow in . Mr. and Mrs. Hauser stayed on , and as far as anyone could tell , kept on with their usual routine . They were still there when we moved  --  Luba had decided the air was better in Hollis , Queens . During the months while we were still at Hamilton Terrace though , my father acquired an odd habit . If he happened to pass the open dining room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was likely to pause there ,  |p162and  look out across the court . Sometimes he shut the sash down hard , and sometimes he let it be , but he always stood there for a time . I never decided whether the look on his face was guilty or proud . I knew well enough why he stood there though . For it was from our house that the music had come . It was from our window that Scheherazade spoke.  |p165RIETTA  MINOT FAY , at thirty-seven , still lived in thehouse in which she , her father and all their known maleforebears but the first had been born , a white , Hudson River-bracketed house , much winged and gabled but with a Revolutionary cottage at its core , set in a tiny village , once only a road , on the west shore of the Hudson River , about twenty-five miles from New York . Arietta 's first forebear , Yves Minot , had come to the States in the entourage of Lafayette ( some said as a body-servant , although this had never been proved ) and had managed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general 's campaigns except Valley Forge . In 1779 , when the general had gone back briefly to France , Yves had stayed behind , first to marry one of the local Dutch girls ( receiving the cottage and a large parcel of land as her dowry ) and later to leave her at home while he ventured into battle or other forays , whenever he was so minded . In 1824 , when Lafayette returned to America for a final visit , Yves was still there , flourishing in all but sons ( because of land inheritance , the Minot line usually ran carefully to one ) and had accompanied the general on his famous triumphal tour , again in some capacity typical of the Minots , something unidentifiable , profitableand without a doubt enjoyable . Arietta , if asked to hazard a guess as to what this might have been , usually replied , with the family talent for presenting itself accurately , that Yves 's function probably had something to do with a cap and bells . For , all the Minots took for granted what they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They werep166jesters , fonctionnaires attending the private person only , quartermasterssupplying the ego , minor affections and spirits of those who were rich enough to keep living standards equal to their own bon viveur tastes , had the intelligence to relish the thrusts of which they were wisely capable , and above all were important enough to enable the Minots to admire them . This was the Minot vanity and their backbone through the years : that managingalways to attach themselves to the most honorable patrons , they had meanwhile restricted their own knavish tricks to the surface diablerie required of their profession  --  that is , to entertainmentonly . Beneath the skin they were not knaves , beyond a certain French clarity as to the main chance , which in turn had instructed them that a supernormal honesty , shrewdly displayed , was invaluable to him who lived on perquisites . For no Minot had ever had a salary , or had gone , as the phrase is , " to work . " Every male Minot had attended a universityas a matter of course , to be refined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some symbiotic relationship that had lasted him for life . Arietta 's father , of the first generation to have no sons , had done his best by sending her to Vassar , where three members of the Rensselaer ( an old dining-club of which he was secretary ) had sent their girls that same year  --  the three men representing respectively money with family , money with politics , and  --  since the Minots had had to lower their standards along with the rest of the world , though belatedly  --  money with money . For until her father 's time  --  and he , poor man , was in no way responsible for the monstrous change in the world  --  all had gone marvelously well with the Minots in both comfort and reputation . And deservedly , for all had worked hard . Although their perquisites had often been extraordinarily vague , ranging from small properties given them to manage and subsequently inherited either in part or in toto , from careers as retainers ( they retained so gracefully ) or as incumbentsof benefices that never had to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the latter-day vulgarities of stockmarket tips  --  no Minot had ever boondoggled at the earning of what he received . Until well past the First World War , one could imagine two important men murmuring of a third , as in another context they might mention that his chef was the great-nephew of Brillat-Savarin  --  " Lucky man , he has a Minot . " Even in the non-Venetian world of post ' 29 , the world that had begun to be so hard on those useful types for which there never seemed to be any but foreign names : the cavaliere servante , the fidus Achates , the condottiere , the . . . Minot  --  the family had still managed , amiably using its talents where there was still scope for them , but for the first time dangerously using its resources when there was not . Over a hundred years in this country had weakened their French pith , making them less antipathetic than they should have been to eating their capital and selling their land . Marrying by inclination had been an even earlier symptom to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for like so many reared nobly , their inclinations had always been a little bit coarse  --  and this had kept the line remarkably healthy . This meant that Arietta , when she came on the market , did so from a long line of non-idiots , non-hemophiliacswith a minimum life-expectancy of eighty . It also meant that , with one thing and another , she had n't much expectancy of anything else except the uses to which she might put her share of Minot temperament  --  that merriment spiked with truth-telling , suppleness just short of servility , and love of ease combined with a wonderfully circuitous energy for pursuing it . Like so many of her ancestors , Arietta was willing to burn any number of ergs in the process , as long as neither dishonor nor the usual channels of attainment were involved . On this particular summer Saturday evening at about seven o'clock , Arietta , dressed to go out in her one still respectable cocktail dress , sat in the dimming upstairs parlor of the housep168that had been hers since the death a year ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father and her husband , and gazed out on the river , musing , moodily for her , on the narrow area of play offered that temperament by the modern world . Saturdaywas shopping day for the week , and that morning , hold back as she might on things like paper napkins  --  they would use the linen ones  --  she had not been able to avoid spending eighteen dollars on food . Her nine-year-old son Roger , away for the night at a friends house , would consume that almost unaidedduring the school week . One of the sweet-voiced robotladiesfrom the telephone company had phoned twice during the past few days , and even the Light &; Power , usually so kindly , had begun to press her about last winter 's beating bill . This week , to the bewilderment of her friends , she had taken to answering the phone in French , ready to aver that " Madame " was away . There had been no cleaning-woman for a year . Behindher , the rooms , receding wing on wing into the hillside with the depressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinguished stainings of a hundred and fifty years , the thin , gradual grime of amateur care . The house , free and clear for a century until the thirties , was hers thanks to her father 's single quirk of hereditary thrift , hidden from them until the otherwise worthless will was read  --  mortgage insurance . It was worth about twenty thousand dollars , possibly a little more to one of that new race of antiquarians who had debauched upon these hills aching to " restore " some old place electrically , and able to  --  viz. the Lampeys , where she was going that evening . But its sale , if she could bring herself to sell , would be slow . Here she sat in it then , in the richest country in the world . In addition to the house , she had a few marketable " old pieces , " small ones to be culled from among the massive bedsteads and armoires , but nothing on which to rear a nineyear-oldboy . She was sitting at Great-grandmother MarieClaire'stambour desk ; Roger could eat it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose-diamonds , and for Marie-Claire 's daughter-in-law 's epergne . And she had $126.35 in the bank . And in addition she had , of course , herself . It had been her only dowry , and until some six months ago she had never seriously attempted to draw upon it . " What a pity , " her golden-haired Uncle Victor  --  elder brother of her father and the last successful one of his generation  --  had remarked of her when she was eight , what a pity that Arietta was n't male , for she seemed to have all the Minot talents , including a marked facial resemblance to the founder of the line . Victor had died , from an overdose of his patron 's pheasant and Lafitte , at the minimal age of eighty , spared from knowing that it was even more of a pity that she was n't a nineteenthcenturymale . But here she was , and she was neither . The room where she sat now was the petit salon that held the conglomerationof family pictures , and without turning to look at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them not only the decline of the private patron  --  of which all the world was aware  --  but of his factotum  --  small , tragic , subdominanttheme that the world had ignored . Above the mantel was Yves , done on ivory , full-length too , which was unusual for the medium . Legend had it that he had insisted on this because , knee-breeched to the end of his life , he had declared a man to be incomplete without a show of calf ; certainly their japing angle went with the face above . It was a triangular face in which all the lines went up , a minstrel face whose nose , long for its tilt , must have moved , as hers did , with speech . The enamelist had even managed to indicate in couleur-de-rose those same crab-apple bumps of cheek she had when she smiled . Next to him was the Dutch wife , shown in conventional oval to the waist , of which there was much , a great blonde , serene in all but her stays . Beneath the two , depending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , werep170their heirs direct and collateral , daguerreotype to Brownie , spilling from the mantel to the side walls . As a curious phenomenon , one could see one or the other of the two progenitorsalways recurring , often with such fidelity that there had long been family slang for the two types  --  " the beefies " for the Dutch ones , and " les maigres " for those mince creatures who were true Minots . Although there had been no intermarrying , one type had usually managed to marry the other , and his children tended to be his opposites as well . Yes , it is all very interesting , thought Arietta  --  we are a fascinating lot , rather like the green and yellow peas in Mendel  --  and her father had often dined out on that story . In time , if there was time , she might dine out on it too . Meanwhile , brooding on the three pictures between Yves and the wedding portrait of herself and Carolingus Fay , deceased , she traced a history much more in Gibbon 's line . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " of whom it might have been said ( as Henry Adams had said of himself ) that " as far as he had a function in life , it was as a stablecompanionto statesmen , whether they liked it or not . " In Claude 's case they had . Next came Louis , her grandfather , who had switched to railroad barons  --  a light sprig of a man who had passed on , full in years and benefices , while accompanying home the equally aged body of his baron , on the Union Pacific somewhere between Ogden and Omaha , in a private car . Under him , in the sepia gloss of the eighties , were his sons , beefies again : her father in his teens , in the deerstalker 's cap so prophetic of his later years , and Victor , already a man with a beautiful Flemish jowl . Victor had already been with " munitions " at the time . At the minimal age of eighty he had died ( her father used to joke ) not of pheasant but of pique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporate air of Delaware , had entered Victor 's exquisitely intangible services on a tax sheet , had actually tried to incorporate him . If so , itp171had still been death in the high style , and of it . But with her father , the long descent , gradual as the grime on her bric-a-brac , was clear . He had still had the hereditary talent , but he had been fifteen years younger than Victor . Patrons herded in groups now instead of carrying on singly , and preferred the distressinglyplebeian admiration of the many to the fine , patrician allegiance of the one . And gaiety , the mark of the personal , was suspect in a sociological world . Ergo her father . When a Minot was stripped of his devotion and of the truth-telling that was its honorable underside , when he was reduced to picking up crumbs of " contact " wherever he could , to making public show of his charms like anyone else , then he did so in the only way he knew . Her father had become a diner-out . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between many long-stemmed rows of pink and tawny glasses , he had dined so well . She glanced at her wrist , remembered that she no longer had a watch , and looked at the river , estimating the seasonal angle of light on the opposite shore . Still too early to walk the short distance to the Lampeys , who , much as they adored her company , touted it , still preferred their guests to arrive , sharply gala , at eight . And these days Arietta aimed to please , had in fact aimed so steadily these past months and so far from her usual haunts , the shabby Saturday night parties of the real denizens of these hills , that it was no wonder if these were alreadyremarking how unexpected it was of Arietta  --  slated one would have said for years yet to the memory of Carolingus  --  to be openly hunting a husband , and in such circles as the Lampeys , too . How surprised they would be if they knew that all she was hunting was a job . A job , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for sloth , but for the spirit . With , of course , perks enough to feed a healthy nine-year-old boy . She rose and went to the mantel , staring up at Yves  --  one " maigre " looking at another . She was four velvet ribbons re/moved from him , and  --  except for Roger , who would be nothing for years yet  --  the last hope of his line . If from his vantage point he could have approved the resemblance , would he have expected her , a female , nevertheless to do something in his line ? Being female , what she had done was , twelve years ago , to marry Carolingus Fay . After Vassar had come a year in Italy with one of the daughters of her father 's three friends ; the girl had married there , and Arietta , after attending her in a horsehairhat , had returned home . Next , the second girl , married to an Englishman who farmed in Nigeria , had invited her there . Against her father 's wishes  --  it was not cautious for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in her lightsome way had enjoyed it , but marooned there , she had missed much of the war and most of the eligible men . In any case , esprit , or whatever it was she had , was difficult in a woman if it was n't so much accompanied by looks as contributed to by them . Returninghome , with her laugh-lines baked deeper than they should have been for her age , and with some knowledge of cacao and palm oil added to the magpie lore of her clan , she had vegetated in the Hudson Valley for a few restless months  --  her father 's profession so seldom left him home to be cooked for  --  and then had gone to Baltimore to visit an old cousin . And there she had met Carolingus . Eighteen years older than she , he had still seemed a man whom many might be glad to marry  --  a very fine " beefy " with proconsular manners and profile , and all his curls . Actually he had been a cliche , poor dear Carolingus  --  old Baltimore French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been very glad to marry her . For , by heredity , and unfortunately nothing else , he was a patron  --  an even sadder case than hers . They had recognized each other , or loved  --  in time it seemed the same thing  --  at once . The only way he could afford to retain her was to come live in her house , which he did , to her father 's delight  --  their mutual recognition too was a touching affair . Carolingus had been too shy to dine out ( he had only the dispensing talent ) , and in time , with her and her father 's full acquiescence , the house and what it held might have been taken by any casual guest to be his . At eighty her father retired , and the two men could not have been happier , jogging along in a life of aristocratic pattern gone native , shootingover their two acres for rabbit instead of grouse , and serving up the game with an excellent dandelion wine . And in their contentment Arietta had been happy too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy , not to see , in whatever dried facts and kernels of incident the day provided , the possibility of a souffle . Even when Carolingus had not long survived her father , she could not avoid thinking that he was better so , just as she could not help seeing , as the long , curlicued , taupe coffin went down the front steps , that it looked exactly like the eclairs of which he had always been so fond . And then of course , it had become her turn  --  to dine out . She had let no one know her real situation ; she would have been plied with all usually offered an untrained widow  --  " rent your lovely rooms to teachers ; become a nursery school aide "  --  all the genteel solutions that would trap her forever . No , she was still child enough of her race to risk all on its chimera : that somewhere there was a post where one might exercise an airy , impalpable training which could never be put down on any resume , somewhere even in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renew her father 's contacts in New York had shown her only how faded they were , and how even those old and well-bred enough to remember the breed she sprang from , its always delicate aims , tended to misinterpret when the diner-out was female , however plain . These last months she had been looking about her in the Valley , among people like the Lampeys , whose kindness had the practicality which went with money still fresh in the till . Tonight , for instance , they were having her in to meet a Miss Bissle from Delaware , who was devoting to a state-wide program of hedge roses and birdp174sanctuaries her one-twenty-fifth share in a great-grandfather 's fortune in explosives , and whose secretary-companion had just died . The Lampeys , drawing Arietta out for Miss Bissle 's benefit , would no doubt ask her to repeat the story they particularly loved  --  about the time a zebra , a real zebra , had appeared in her garden  --  although she had other anecdotes she herself preferred . A humanist , she liked stories about people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no ending really , and an explanationthat was sadly mundane . She would much rather tell about Claude and Henry Clay , about one of the Great Compromiser'scompromises that had never reached the historians . Or about Louis 's patron , a philanthropist who gave in kind only , and who , on being approached at his door by a panhandlerwho wanted money for a glass eye , was able to invite him into a cabinet de travail where he had a box of them . But considering the roses and birds , possibly the zebra was more in line . Across the river , the last evening light shone on the silver roof of a New York Central streamliner ; she had a few minutes ' walk and it was time . Courage , she said to herself , thinking of Roger . You are learning your trade a little late , that is all . You still have $126.35 worth of time . And maybe Miss Bissle would be a jolly hedonist who wanted a " good companion , " although this was not often the conclusion one drew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any case , that when the artist is good , it is still the patron who is on trial . Reaching up toward Yves , she blew the dust from his frame . Why should our art , she thought , the art of happiness , be such a drug on the market these days ? On that note , she tilted her head and went out , swinging the skirt of her dress , luckily so dateless , and tapping sharply , almost as if she scolded it , the tambour desk . Meanwhile , a few minutes away , the Lampeys and their houseguests , Miss Bissle and her second cousin Robert , werep175speaking of Arietta . Parker and Helen Lampey , a white-haired couple in their sixties , had started life together at Christian College , Missouri , but long since , owing to Parker 's rise to the extreme altitudes of international law , had accustomed themselves to the ponderous social mixture to be found there  --  Swiss bankers , German industrialists , American judge advocates and solid rich like the Bissles . Thirty years of moving intercontinentallyhad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had never felt an expatriate tingle . What it had done was to give them the eternally pink-checked , good-tempered look of summerpeople ; they had in fact been summer people all over the world . By native standards they should have been suffering from all the ills of cosmopolitan riches and ease ; actually money , comfort and change had kept them amiable , enabling them to be as kindly as they looked , though considerably more worldly . Parker held several directorships adjacent to Robert , whose share in the family fortune was much larger than Miss Bissle 's , and it was through him they had heard of her needs . And had at once thought of Arietta . " I made Robert come with me , " said Miss Bissle , " because Mary Thrace , the last one , you know  --  drank . " She was a large , gray pachyderm of a woman whose eyes blinked slowly . " And I do n't at all . You would think that would make it easier to notice in others , would n't you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Well , I do , " said her cousin , looking at his drink through the lower half of his bifocals . " Steadily . So you did just right . " Parker smiled . He knew Robert , a quiet , abstemious sort , widowed early and childless , devoted to rather sec philanthropiessince . One of those mild , almost expunged men for whom second or third generation fortune was a conscience , not a release . " Why do men always make themselves out more colorfulp176than they are ? " said Miss Bissle , for whom Robert , past fifty , was still a younger cousin . Helen Lampey glanced at Miss Bissle 's shoes , the flat , selfassuredfeet of a woman who would never know why . Her cousin looked the way most people who wore glasses like that did  --  round and tame . " Is this Mrs. Fay outdoorsy ? " said Miss Bissle . " Mary Thrace was n't . " " I do n't know that one thinks of her as out ' or in , ' " said Helen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Delightful either place . In Arietta 's company , where you are always seems just where you want to be . The father was just the same . " Helen could see Miss Bissle thinking that this was not the way one got things done . " She had a year in Africa , " she said hastily . " I should think one would have to be . . . outdoorsy ... there . And of course she grew up right here in the Hudson Valley  --  why , they caught a copperhead on their place only last year . " " Still has the old place . Old family hereabouts , the Minots , " said Parker , rising to replenish the drinks . " Minot ! " Robert said softly . " Did you say  --  Minot ? " " Yes , ever know any of them ? Understand they were quite a family at one time . " Busy with the drinks , he did not note Robert 's lack of response , covered in any case by Miss Bissle . " Trigonocephalous contortrix , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Robert sat back in his chair . Yes , I knew a Minot , he thought . I knew Victor . Probably is n't the same family ; chances are it could n't be . Still , what Lampey had just said about the woman they were expecting  --  that was just the way Victor had been , turning life rosy and immediate wherever he was , and for adults too , as could be seen in the aureole that went round a room with him  --  not merely for Robert , the small boy onp177whom he had occasionally shone his great face , fair , hot and flame-colored as Falstaff 's sun . Looking back on Victor now from the modern distance , it seemed to Robert that he must have dreamed him  --  that day on the Brandywine for instance , 1912 it must have been , when Victor had taken him fishing , the same day he had insisted on letting Robert join the men lunchingat Robert 's grandfather 's table before the stockholders ' meeting , and had fed the boy wine . Robert could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that portly group , the starched cars of the napkin he had tied around his cravat shining blue in the water-light reflected from walls that were white instead of walnut because of his choice , the napkin flecked , as lunch went on , with sauces Victor had conspired with the cook , the heavy company meanwhile tasting him with the same negligent appreciation they gave the food , as now and then he sent a sally rolling down the table like a prism , or bent over Robert , saying , " A little more claret with the water , Robert ? . . . And now , if you please  --  a little more water with the claret . " After lunch , Robert had seen him give his grandfather a sheaf of papers , saying , " Here they are , Bi  --  Robert and I are going out after turtle . " As they left , one of the men said , " Bi  --  where do you get your cigars ? "  --  it was Victor who had started people calling Robert 's grandfather Bi . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the man 's murmured envy , his grandfather had taken a careful puff , gently guarding the long , firm ash , and had smiled . And that afternoon on the dock , sitting over the lines that the caramel-colored Negroes in the shack behind them had lent them , had been a time he had remembered always , like a recurrent dream  --  a day on which absolutely nothing had happenedexcept sun , water and the lax blush of the wine in his limbs . And Victor  --  doing nothing all afternoon except what he did everywhere , making one feel that whatever you and he were doing at the moment was " it , " that where you were was " here . " They had caught , Robert recalled , two turtles ; he remembered being warned of their bite , and informed , lovingly , of their soup . " Victor , " he had asked suddenly , " what are you in ? "  --  meaning chemicals , cotton , tin , this being the way men in those days , at that table , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not ' in ' " had been the laughing answer . " You might say I 'm  --  with . " Breathing hard , Victor had been peering in at the hamper that held the turtles . Robert had looked down at him . " So shall I be , " he had said . " Oh no you wo n't . You 're already stuck with it , like these chaps . You 're already in . " Victor had risen , puffing . " Best you 'll be able to do is to have somebody around like me  --  way Bi does . " Robert had considered . " I 'll have you then if I may , " he had said . Victor 's face had been in shadow , the sun behind him , but after more than forty years Robert could still sense in him the unnameable quality that had sent him fishing in his cravat . " Mmm . If your father does n't get to you first , " he said . And Robert 's father had got to him first , as , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Victor . Not a hard man , his father , but a dull one , of the powerful new breed that cherished its dullness for its safety , and meant to impose that , along with the rest of its worldly goods , on its sons . " Like that brew we had at lunch ? " Victor had said , as they trotted the hamper along the shore . " And well you might , " he said , mentioning a name , a year . " Pity I 've only daughters , " he sighed . " Women 've no palate . Perfume kills it . " Above them , atop the green dunes of lawn that swept to the water 's edge , a small figure waved at them , his grandfather , guests sped , sauntering the veranda alone . " Will I have one , d' ya think ? " asked Robert . " Mmm , ca n't tell yet . " Robert considered . His grandfather , colorless and quiet , seemed to him much like his father , who drank only Saratoga water . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Victor smiled , waving back . " He 's got me , " he said . And Grandfather was like me really , not like Father , thoughtp179Robert , returning to the Lampeys ' , where conversation , as so often happened elsewhere , had rippled on without him . He as a dull man too , as I am , but like me with the different and often painful dimension of not valuing it , of knowing that somewhere , sometimes in the same room , conversation twinkled past him like a prism , a rosier life went by . Grandfather was like me . But Grandfather had Victor . And looking at the door through which Emily 's possibility was to come , telling himself that it was midsummer madness  --  of Victor 's daughters one was dead and the other last heard of years ago in a nursing order in Louisiana  --  he still told himself that he would not be surprised , not at all , if the woman who came through the door were to be huge and serenely fair , a great Flemish barmaid of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked through the door , he was surprised , at the depth of his disappointment . For what he saw was a slight woman , almost tiny , whose hair , sugared now like preserved ginger , might once , at youth 's best , have been russet , a small creature whose oddly tweaked face  --  one of those pulled noses , cheeks that looked as if each held the secret cherry of some joke  --  was the farthest possible from the classic sun-face he remembered . Even if she were some relation , she was nothing like . There was no point in asking , in opening a private memory to future rakings over whenever he paid a duty call on Emily . For what he was looking at , he reminded himself , all he was looking at was Emily 's future companion . As the evening progressed , he was not so sure . For the Lampeys ' protegee remained dumb . From their baffled glances he judged that this was not usual ; he himself would have guessed that Mrs. Fay 's ordinary manner , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever reason , her eyes remained veiled , her hands folded in the lap of her pale , somewhat archaic skirt . A certain stubborn aura spread from her , but nothing else , certainlynothing of the subtle emanation they had been promised ,  |p180and  but rarely a word . Only Emily , impervious to this as she was to so much , noticed nothing , intent on numbering the occasional sips Mrs. Fay took of her wine . Nor could Arietta have explained . She could have said only that almost at once she had felt Miss Bissle to be a person she could never admire . Or tell the truth to , the truth about Miss Bissle being what it was . Not because Miss Bissle was dull  --  the best patrons necessarily had almost as much dullness as money  --  but that she did not suffer from it , whereas the real patrons , all the great ones , had a sweetening tremor of self-doubt at the core . If dullness was what had made them keep Minots , then this human ( and useful ) sweetening was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thought Arietta . Roger , she said to herself . $126.35 . Nevertheless , when Parker deftly introduced Nigeria , on which he had often heard her entertain , she heard herself furnish him three sentences on the cultivation of the cocoa nib , then fall still . It must be stage fright , her first professionalengagement . Her father should have told her that the artist 's very piety and scruples were a considerable hindrance when the artist came down to dining out . In desperation she gulped the rest of her wine . Opposite her Miss Bissle blinked slowly at Robert , as if to say " I count on you . " " Arietta ! " said Helen Lampey . It was half command , half plea . " Do tell us the story about your zebra . " " Zebra ? " said Robert . " Have you hunted them , Mrs. Fay ? " " No . " Mrs. Fay addressed her small , clenched hands . " That 's equatorial Africa . " She heard Helen sigh . " Have you ? " Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Robert Bissle was that once in a while , under certain conditions , he lied . Not on the Exchange of course , or in any real situation . It was his only valve , his sole vice , and it escaped him , with the wistful sound of steam from an air-locked radiator , only when , as tonight , he deemed himself in the safe company of those even duller than he . He leaned back  --  on these occasions hep181always did . " Zebras are very beautiful creatures . I never molested them save to procure specimens for the museums , or food for the porters , who liked their rather rank flesh . " Mrs. Fay , for almost the first time , raised her eyes and looked closely at him . " Yes ? " she said . Her nose , he observed , moved with speech . " Do go on . " " The hartebeest , " he said slowly . " Coke 's hartebeest , known locally by the Swahili name of kongoni  --  were at least as plentifuland almost as tame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I never knew you were in Africa . " " Oh yes , " he said , still looking at his neighbor , in whose odd face  --  he had not noticed until now  --  all the lines went up . " One year when your back was turned . " He plunged on . " A few months before my arrival , a mixed herd of zebra and hartebeestrushed through the streets of Nairobi , several being killed by the inhabitants , and one of the victims falling just outside the Episcopal church . " " Handy , " said Helen Lampey , in spite of having been informedthat the Episcopal was Miss Bissle 's own . She was watching Arietta and Robert  --  Arietta with Robert , smiling her pawkiest smile at him , and saying , " Yes , yes , do go on . " Robert took off his glasses . No , there was no resemblance , not even if he imagined a napkin tied round her neck , although for a moment there he had almost fancied an echo saying , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head . The company , whatever it was , was not as safe as he had thought . " Your turn , " he said . " Your zebra . " Arietta unfolded her hands . They trembled slightly . Miss Bissle 's cousin , and even richer one had heard  --  and even more . One of the old breed , she was sure of it  --  and she had almost missed him . " My zebra ? " she said . " Mine was  --  " She had been about to say real . But one let people see one knew the truth about them only after one had won them , sometimes longp182after . And particularly these people . " Mine was  --  here , " she said . " Right here in the Hudson Valley . In our garden . " " So help me it was , " said Parker . " I saw it . Go on , Arietta . " So she did . It had been a Saturday morning , she said , and she had been sitting in her bath , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door and said there were policemen in the garden and she had called back , " Tell Daddy . " Minutes later , Roger had knocked again and said , " Mum , there 's a zebra in the garden , " and she had replied  --  " Tell Daddy . " " Now , " said Arietta , " Roger is not a fey child . I should have known . " She knew every periphrasis of this story , every calculated inflection and aside ; this was the point where everyone always began to smile expectantly , and pausing , she saw that they had . " I 've never been able to afford to disbelieve him since . " For then Carolingus had come up the stairs . " He looked , " said Mrs. Fay , delaying softly , expertly , " well  --  like a man who has just seen a zebra in his garden . " As , according to him , he had . She went downstairs  --  and so had he . She made them see the scene just as she had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yelling " Stand back there ! " from a point well behind Carolingus , and there , cornered in a cul-de-sac near the carriage house , flashing and snorting , the zebra , ribanded in the rhododendronslike a beast out of the douanier Rousseau . " The policemen , " she said , " had had no breakfast , so there I found myself , carrying a tray with sugar and cream and my best coffee cake  --  luckily I had baked on Friday  --  to two policemen and a zebra , in a back yard twenty-five miles from New York . " She rose , circled the room , holding the scene with her hands pressed lightly together , and as if absent-mindedly , poured Parker some coffee out of the Lampeys ' silver pot . Outside , in the Lampeys ' garden , a barn owl hooted  --  it was the atmosphere , conspiring gently with her as usual . She waited . At this point someone always asked , " But how ? " " But how ? " said Miss Bissle.  | " Ah , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ double back . I have to tell you that across from us , in one of those very modern houses with the kitchen set just under the crown of the road , the family gets up very early . They garden , and the mother-inlawis a past president of the Audubon Society of Atlanta , Georgia . " Still circling the room , a diseuse gently fabricating her own spotlight , Mrs. Fay rested one hand , a brief wand , on Miss Bissle 's shoulder as she passed her . Robert watched , enthralled . There was nothing to it , yet she held them all . They sat like marionettes whom she was awakening slowly to a mild , quizzical sensation like the pleasure-pain in a sleeping foot . " And at about six o'clock that morning , the head of the County Police picked up the phone and heard a cultivated Southern voice say , Ah should like to repo't that jus ' now , as we wuh sctten at breakfas ' , we saw a zebra payss bah on the Rivuh Road . ' " Parker laughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in quickly . " Ah yes , " she said , " ca n't you hear her ? And the chief thought to himself that the River Road is rather the bohemianpart of his parish , and that Saturday morning comes , well  --  after Friday night . So he calls our policeman and says , ' George , people down your neck of the woods seeing zebras . ' George decides to wait until , well , two or more people see it . Then Joe Zucca , the old caretaker at Fagan 's , telephones , babblingthat a striped horse is crashing around his conservatory . And the chase is on . And they bring it to bay in our garden . " Parker guffawed . " There are zebras at the bottom of my garden . " Arietta , reaching her own chair , sat down in it . Someone alwayssaid that too . She looked round at their faces . Yes , she had them , particularly one . Quickly , quickly now , wind it up . And in a long , virtuoso breath , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the yard , a gold mine if she 'd just had the lollipop concession , how her smart-aleck neighbor had stopped by the front gate , offering a drive to town , and when she'dp184said , " Wait a bit , Tom , we 've got a zebra in the back yard , " had smirked and said " Yeah , I heard that one at Armando 's  --  and the horse said , I 've been trying to get it to take its pajamas off all night . ' " And how it had been one of the great satisfactionsin life to be able to lead him round to the carriage house . And how the cops had finally got hold of the Hudson River Cowboys Association  --  yes there was one , those kids in white satin chaps and ten-gallon hats who always rode palominosin the Independence Day Parade  --  and how they 'd come , out of costume alas , but with their horse trailer , and how Carolingus and the cops had finally jockeyed the beast in , using a three-man lasso . And how , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three heated men hanging on ropes , the whole garden spiraling like a circus suddenly descended from the sky , and in the center of it all , the louche and striped , the incredible  --  how Arietta 's eighty-five-year-old Cousin Beck from Port Washington , a once-a-year and always unheralded visitor , had steamed up the driveway in her ancient Lincoln , into the center of it all . " Oh , Cousine Beck , " she 'd stammered  --  in French , she never knew why  --  " you find us a little en deshabille , we have us un zebre . " And how Beck , taking one look , had eased her old limbs out of the car and grunted , " Arietta , you are dependable . Just bring me a chair . " Mrs. Fay folded her hands . Now someone would ask the other question . She gave a sigh . Next to her , her neighbor marveled . No , she was nothing like  --  no aureole . This one whisked herself in and out , like a conjuror 's pocket handkerchief . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignored , made themselves known , piped like a brigade of mice from their holes . There was a confused keenness in the ear . . . nose . . . air ? One saw the draperies , peach-fleshed velour , and waited for their smell . The chandelier tinkled , an owl hooted , and a man could hear his own breath . The present , drawn from all its crevices , was here.  | " But where did the beast come from ? " said Miss Bissle . Yes , it would be she , thought Arietta . The cousin , his glasses still off , was staring at her with eyes that were bright and vague . " A runaway , " she said in a cross voice . It always made her sulky to have to end the fun this way , with no punch line but fact . " There 's an animal importer up the mountain ; we found out later . He buys them for zoos . " She turned pertly to the cousin . " Perhaps it was one of yours . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Miss Bissle . " I 've always known exactly where you were . " Robert , before he replaced his glasses , had a vague impression that Mrs. Fay looked guilty , but she spoke so quickly that he must have been wrong . " Parker , " she said , " did you and Helen ever hear about GreatgrandfatherClaude , and Mr. Henry Clay ? " They had n't . Nor had they heard about Louis 's patron 's glass eye . Robert , saved , sank deeper in his chair . He was his father 's son after all , trained to fear the sycophant , and he brooded now on whether Mrs. Fay wanted something of him . Look how she had got round the Lampeys . Was she honest ? Victor 's tonic honesty , he remembered , had spared no one ; he never flattered individually but merely opened to dullards the gross , fine flattery of life alone . And what did he , Robert , want of her ? If he closed his eyes , prisms of laughter floated past him , flick-flack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could feel , there and here , the lax blush of the present in his limbs . He slouched in it , while Arietta told how , when Carolingus spoke for her , her father had said , " You know she has no dot . " And how Carolingus , who was slightly deaf , had replied , " I 've no dough either . " And how in after years , both always amiably purported to be unsure of who had said which . And then Robert sat up in his chair . For Arietta was telling the story of the " beefies " and " les maigres . " So that 's it , he thought . I knew it , I knew it all the time.  |p186And  in the recesses of his mind he felt that same rare satisfactionwhich came to him whenever he was able to add to a small fund he had kept in a downtown savings bank almost since boyhood , money separate from inheritance , made by his own acumen , on his own . I recognized her , he thought , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing all evening , that in the right company he was not such a dullard after all . He leaned back now and watched her  --  quiet now after her sally , unobtrusive whenever she chose . It was not wit she pretended to ; her materials were as simple as a child 's . What was the quality she shared with Victor , born to it as the Bissles were born to money , that the others here felt too , for there was Lampey , murmuring ingenuously into his brandy-cup " Wonderfulstuff , this , is n't it ? "  --  quite oblivious of the fact that it was his own  --  and there even was Emily , her broad feet lifted from the floor ? Whatever Mrs. Fay did , its effect was as Victor 's had been , to peel some secondary skin from the ordinary , makingwherever one was  --  if one was with her  --  loom like an object under a magnifying glass  --  large , majestic and there . She made one live in the now , as , time out of mind it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did not know how she did it . Or whether she did . Watching her rise from her chair , begin to make her adieu , the thought came to him that he would not mind spending a lifetime finding out . " Let me go with you , " he said , standing up . " Let me drive you home . " But Emily had arisen too . " Mrs. Fay , " she said , her blinking fluttered , " have you had any experience with birds ? " Arietta smiled between them . How lucky she had recognized him , the real thing , poor dear , even if his sad little blague  --  out of African Game Trails of course , old Teddy Roosevelt , on half the bookshelves in Nigeria  --  was not . " Do , " she said to him , " but let 's walk . " She turned to Miss Bissle. and let the truth escape from her with gusto . After allp 187it was her own . " No , not really . Of course  --  I 've shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river , lapping blandly , made conversation . Robert spoke once . " I do n't really think Emily would have suited you , " he said , and Mrs. Fay replied that it was nice of him to put it that way round . At Arietta 's doorway , they paused . But it was imperative that she find out what was on his mind . Or put something there . " I 'd ask you in , " she said , " but I 've nothing but dandelion wine . " " I 've never had any , " said Robert . " I 'd like to try it . " She led him through the hall , past the rack where Carolingus'sleather jacket hung , and her father 's , and the squirrelskinweskit they had cured for Roger , then through the softly ruined downstairs rooms , up the stairs and into the little salon . It was an educative tour ; it told him a great deal . And this was the family room ; he sensed the intimate patchouli that always clung to the center of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them all above the mantel , hanging on their velvet tree . While Arietta went for the wine , he moved forward to examinethem . What a higgler 's collection they were , in their grim descent from ivory to pasteboard to Kodak , yet a firm insouciancewent from face to face , as if each knew that its small idiom was an indispensable footnote to history , to the Sargents , Laverys , de Laszlos that people like him had at home . And there , in that small brown-tone . Yes , there . " Take me round the portraits , " he said when she returned , and here too , since she also was on the wall , he learned . he saw that Carolingus must have been of an age near his own . " And who are they ? " he said . " You missed that one . " They were sitting at a small escritoire on which she had placed the wine , and if he stretched a hand he could touch the faded browntone . " That 's my father as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What an absurd feeling happiness was . That must be itsp188name . To feel as if such a sum , such a round sum had been deposited in that bank that he need never go there again . Not if he stayed here . As , in time , he thought , he could arrange . Opposite him , Arietta fingered a drawer inside which the name of the desk 's first owner was inscribed  --  Marie-Claire , who had married for inclination but had got the rose-diamonds too . She stole a glance at her vis-a-vis . After all , she had recognizedhim , and in time , as she did remember , this and inclinationcould come to be almost the same . It was strange that he was no " beefy , " but she had already had one  --  and no doubt her tribe , along with the rest of the world , must move on . And he was very responsive . In time , she thought , the house would come to seem to him like his own . " Wonderful stuff , " he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old green bottles into which Carolingus and her father had put the wine . " Is it really ? " said Arietta . " I was never any help to them on it . " " What it wants , " he said , " is to be decanted , for the sediment . One does it against a candle flame . I was thinking  --  I might come by tomorrow . And show you . " " Do  --  for company , " said Mrs. Fay . " Actually , one wine seems to me much like any other . I 've got no palate for it . Women do n't , my father always used to say . " " No , they do n't . " He was looking at her so deeply that she was startled . " Perfume kills it , " he said , and so intensely that , odd averral as it was , it hung over them both like an avowal of Iove . Downstairs , she let him out the front door , and watched him to the end of the lane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another dog set up an answering cry . In the darkness , as she closed the door , she smiled , one of old Teddy 's sentences lumberingthrough her mind . " The hunter who wanders these lands sees the monstrous river-horse snorting , the snarling leopardp189and the coiled python , the zebras barking in the moonlight . " As she went back up the stairs , she wondered whether she would ever tell him . Some truths , as an honest companion , one spoke in jest ; others , as a woman , one kept to oneself . At the moment it did n't matter . Standing in the doorway of the little salon , she stretched her arms . " I 've dined out ! " she said to the pictures , to herself . " I 've dined on zebra , and on hartebeest , and yes , I think , on . . . husband . I 've dined well . " Outside the hedge at the end of the lane , Robert watched the door close . He knew just how it would begin tomorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never asked anyone , to call him " Bi . " There would always be a temptation to say more  --  who , for instance , would understand about that day on the Brandywine better than she ? But he must remember ; with all she was  --  she was also a woman . They liked to be chosen for themselves . He must always be as mindful of that as of his incredible luck . And what utter luck it was ! He swelled with the urge to tell someone about it . But there were not many in the world today who could appreciate precisely its nature . It was even possible that he himself was the last one extant of all those who once had . Standing in the shadow of the hedge , he whispered it to himself , as once a man had whispered it to his grandfather , over the cigar . " Lucky man , " he said to himself , " you have a Minot ! "  |p1930  N an afternoon late in the Indian summer of 1918 , on the lawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the city the next day , a garden party was ending , and the talk there was all of the war , which was ending too . But inside the house  --  in a room called the " music " room because it held chairs in which no one could settle , a piano on which no one played , and a broken guitar slanted in a corner like a stricken figure  --  the Elkin child , Hester , lay on the floor , wishing that the war would never end and that a little old couple called the Katzes had never come to the party at all . Outside , in the pink , operatic light , all the town guests , most of them Mr. Elkin 's elderly retainers , had just gone , lookingalmost rakish out of their city serge , in the foulards , pongees , and sere straws they had thought proper to the occasion . Her father , who was the head of the family and of the business which supported it , attracted retainers  --  as her mother often said  --  as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and useless to the point of impossibility , like old Mr. Katz , they swam knowingly toward him out of the sea of incompetents , and he kept them on , out of sympathy , some vanity , and an utter lack of the executive violence necessary to have off with their heads . Today , all of them had eaten greedily of cakes whose scarce ingredients had been so happily procured , had partaken reverentlyof Mr. Elkin 's claret  --  meanwhile chattering thinly of what the end of the war boom might do to such claret-consumingincomes as the one which maintained them  --  and ancientp194relatives whom Hester had never before seen out of chairs had sat daringly on the grass . Toward the end of the party , Mr. Katz ( thought of by Hester as her Mr. Katz ) , who had drunk no claret , had nevertheless been found sitting on the grass too , dazedly preoccupied in wrapping remnants of cake and ice cream , plates and all , in some napkins and a length of string , yards of which projected from a ball in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his wife had just gone , gathered up and reassembled by Miss Lil , Mr. Elkin 's forelady , a tall old woman with dead-black hair and a face like a white Jordan almond , who had shepherded them into a taxi , flapped her draperies officiously over their humbled , retreating backs , and climbed in after them with a great show of agility , as one whose competence age had not affected . Outside the window now , Hester 's mother and Mr. Elkin 's sisters , Aunt Mamie and Aunt Flora , clinked and murmured over retrospective cups of coffee . The aunts , as per custom , had come out from the city the night before , to " help " in their peculiar way  --  Flora to check interminably on Mrs. Elkin : " What you have to pay for this chicken , your butter , these berries , Hattie ? " and to cap each of her sister-in-law 's responses with some triumphantly cawed instance of her own shrewdness in such matters . Mamie would clog the air with vague recipes out of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an extra and regional delicacy either because these scorned Yankee exactitude for " a pinch " of this and " a piece the size of a walnut " of that , or had some little trick she could never quite recall  --  " a wild geranium leaf , I think it was "  --  or had no pertinence whatever to the occasion at hand , like okra soup , when the question was afternoon tea . In addition , both had to squelch any assumption on the part of the maid that they might be poor relations , and this they did by handily assuming any of Mrs. Elkin 's duties which were merely verbal ,  |p195and  by their keenly critical acceptance of service at one magpiesit-down snack after another . " Good coffee , " said Flora . " The last of the Mocha Joe got from his importer friend , " said Hester 's mother . It was in the nature of things that Flora 's remark was tinctured with disapproval , and Mrs. Elkin 's with a hint of scarcities to come . " I must n't eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says I 'm not to gain another ounce beforehand . Did you know  --  I ate a pound and a half of Seckel pears the night before Hester was born ! " " No wonder she 's so greenish , " said Mamie 's pecking voice . " I know , I know , " said her mother . " The summer has n't done a thing for her . Autointoxication , Kozak says . He thinks I ought to put her on a farm , let her get built up . I thought maybe next spring , when the time comes . Or afterwards . " Hester inched closer to the window . The family had made the transition from Manhattan to White Plains very late this summer , because of that ailing of Mrs. Elkin 's which Hester knew to be connected with the impending birth of a baby . She had guessed this , just as she had long ago concluded that what her parents really wanted , and what they must have wanted her to be , was a boy . To the aunts , and Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At fifty , Mr. Elkin had produced Hester , last in a line of six girl first cousins , the other five of whom  --  Isabelle , Lucille , Jessamine , Gertrude , and Caroline  --  were sitting in their own group on the lawn now . All of these were flamboyantly handsome young women , to whom the nine-yearoldHester had never once been likened except , ruefully , in the matter of sex . If the women in her family ( as , possibly , in the world ) seemed to be of peculiarly dominant natures , it might be because they must never admit to a value somewhat loweredbecause there were so many of them . " I 've set my foot down with Joe , " said Mrs. Elkin . A cupp196rang decisively in a saucer . " We 're not going to take on this place another summer , with the war ending , and nobody knowing what business will do . Now he 's even talking about a trained nurse , instead of a practical . When we should be cutting down  --  all along the line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself , " said Flora . " No , " said Mrs. Elkin . " No , indeed . " " The way he lets people run on at the factory ! " Mamie put in hastily . " A place that size , without a proper chemist ! But he lets that Lil , who I remember when she was nothing but the head girl . . . and now she wo n't even tell Joe himself the formulas ! " Oakley and Company , as Mr. Elkin 's business was known , were wholesale purveyors of finely milled hand soaps , individuallywrapped in paper printed with testimonials so genteel , so familiar to the devoted users , and in such fine type , that these were rarely read . In addition they had several lines of talcums and toilet water  --  old-fashioned essences of lilac , rose , coreopsis , lily of the valley , and violet , favored mostly by that trade which had once been carriage : gentlemen whose tastes had retiredwith their incomes , and grandes dames living in rooms alreadyoverheated with the floral essence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its staff was as old as its clientele . " And Katz ! " said Flora . " My God , Hattie , is n't Joe going to do something about Katz ? It 's a wonder the firm is n't a laughingstockto the trade ! " " I keep telling him , " said Mrs. Elkin . " I had it out with him that awful day we came down here . " That day , the trip had been made , as usual , in a touring car hired with driver for the occasion , and as usual it had been a caravan of hampers , floating motor veils , and hindsight ejaculations . At the last minute , the two aunts had arrived uninvited , with a bland coincidence that had overreached itself in theirp197already having donned veils . At that minute which inevitably followed the very last one , " old man Katz , " the messenger boy attached to Mr. Elkin 's office , had arrived with a folder of money , checks , and notes that he seemed unwilling to surrender , standing there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparent on his bewildered , age-spotted face that they had been afraid to leave him there on the street , and had wedged him in , too . Hester , squeezed in next to him for the long ride , sneaking looks at his shaky , almost luminous hands with the blue veins and the brown cemetery spots , had felt that he and she were kin . He and she were the worthless people , whom the practical people could not forever afford . With her father , she and Katz were safe . Mr. Elkin , when pressed for an indulgence , might counter , " Money does n't grow on trees , daughter ! " but this was a joke promptly nullified by the indulgence itself , provoking only a delightful image of a tree from which , in ropes and ribbons and spangles , money did somehow hang . But from her mother 's arpeggios of background complaint came another portent , tied to the lurking references to the baby , and focused not so much on living expenses as on the particular objects of Mr. Elkin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be one . For with her father , one had only to be . But with Mrs. Elkin , some businesslike reason for being was expected . With her there was a status to be earned , either by a displayable beauty , like that of those cousinsto whom Hester was never compared , or by some competence , of which , in company with Katz , Hester had only the lack . Lately , the predicted end of the war and the arrival of the baby had joined in Hester 's mind as the probable end of a halcyon time , after which expenses like herself and Katz , unlessthey could justify themselves in the meantime , might not be rescuable , even by her father , from her mother 's measurementof worth . All that uneasy summer she had listened withp198concern to the fluctuating dinner-table destiny of Katz , appraisingit silently , feeling that it involved her own . Today though , at the party 's beginning , Mrs. Elkin had sat in its midst in a peaceful mood that had thickened upon her of late , letting others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her , and for them all , the ultimate extravagance . With the most lavish , reassuring touch of all  --  she had invited Mr. and Mrs. Katz . Therefore , when Mr. and Mrs. Katz had trotted up the path this afternoon , it had at first seemed an augury of the best for them and Hester also , for expendables everywhere . For , judged by the least worldly of standards , the market value of the Katzes must be doubtful indeed . With matching white wool hair , stunted twin statures of something under five feet each , and flat , cartilaginous faces nodding , blanched and puzzled , over their hard Sunday black , they looked like two elderly lambs , somewhere between full size and mantelpiece . Lambs , moreover , between whom there must be a preliminary agreement that Mr. Katz was to do the gamboling for the family , and Mrs. Katz the baaing . While Mr. Katz , whisking back and forth between the guests , his hands tremulous with cake plates and cups , seemed determined to prove that his rickety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Katz plodded from the edge of one group to another , looking up at the faces of the conversationalists until she caught a declarative sentence , which she would thereupon confirm with a loud , assenting " Annnnh ! " Watching them , Hester thought it cheering that two of such small wit had not only found each other , but managed to grow old . Later , watching her mother , as Mr. Katz was uncoiled from his string , wiped , and sped on his way , she had seen that her mother had not been cheered . Now she stretched out an arm and scuffed the strings of the guitar , which let out a plangent sigh . " Hester ! Come out in the open air ! "  |p199Outside  , clouds of motes gyrated in the lustrous , Indian heat . Her mother bent again over her embroidery hoop . Aunt Mamie was crocheting in nervous jerks , and Aunt Flora was stringing the bronze beads and jet passementerie with which she would later adorn her front . Near them , in a circlet of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but such was the twiddling of curls by ringed fingers , the fluttering of chiffon kerchiefs drooped from airy wrists , that one had almost an impression that they were . Behind the casement Hester stuck out a wrist and shook it , but the effect was not the same . She picked up the guitar , hugging it to her like a doll , and walked outside . Standing near the older women , she listened to the ripple of the cousins , the stirred flounces , the round-robin lilt of " the Casino , " " the Island , " " the Turkey Trot , " that went from velvety head to head of those five who so resembled one another in their darkfannedeyes , fair necks , and cheeks that curved with rose . " Will you look at that hem line , " said her mother . " Half up from her knees again ! " Hester sat down , looking at herself . One was to be built up , yet one 's hem lines were to stay the same . There was no pleasing them  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She looked over at the cousins . They are a wreath , she thought . They are like a rosy wreath . They were as closed to her as if they had locked hands against her , meanwhile interchangingthe soft passwords of their pet names  --  Belle , Cile , Jessy , Trudy , Lina . " Mother , " she said . " Why do n't I have a nickname ? Why do n't I ? " Her mother 's needle speared a French knot . " Oh  --  I do n't know . " She held her work critically at arm 's length . " Daddy and I are just not a nickname family , maybe . " " Nicknames come natural , " said Aunt Flora . " Drink morep200milk . Maybe one 'll float up . " She looked over at her Belle , her mouth smug . Hester took a breath . " When the baby comes  --  will Daddy keep Mr. Katz ? " " Why , whatever put ... ? " Her mother glanced at the aunts , who looked down in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . " Mrs. Elkin expelled her breath in a chiding sigh , as if at some unknown transgressor . " There 's a limit to what one can do for some people . Sometimes it is n't even a kindness to do it . " Reddened , she stared at Hester , with severity , as if some of the unseen offender 's guilt had rubbed off on her . Hester stood up . At the far end of the lawn , her father and the uncles were talking business , ratifying their words with large , blue puffs from their long cigars . She walked toward them . " What do you know ! " said her mother behind her . " Out of the mouths ! " said Mamie . " Out of the mouths . " Hester sat down on the grass near her father 's chair . He was lighting a fresh cigar , and absently passed her the band . " Coronas ! " her mother had said this morning , watching her father carefully slit a brown box . " Nothing too good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the week her father smoked Garcia Vegas . " Here 's a quarter , Hester . Run down and get me three Garcia Vegas . " Bending over , she saw her face in the shiny guitar , sallow , shuttered , and long . It must lack some endearing lineament , against which people and language might cuddle . For it , a nicknamewas a status to be earned . Leaning against her father 's chair , she fell asleep , rocking the guitar . Sometimes , in her doze , it was Mr. Katz she rocked , sometimes it was herself . During the next days , after the Elkins ' return to the city , all New York seemed brimming with more than the autumn season . At school assemblies , teachers rehearsed " The Red Cross Nurse , " " There 's a Long , Long Trail A-Winding , " " In Flan/ders Field , " with a zest that lilted through and contravened even the saddest days . During the day , street corners knotted up with chattering crowds , and at night , Hester @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound of windows upflung to the halloos of newsboys who ran below with indistinct , curdled wails . On the morning of the Armistice , racing home from school declared off for the day , she was certain that this morning , in her absence , the baby must have been born , too . Her mother however was there as usual in toque and wide , shapeless coat edged in martin , waiting for Hester to eat her creamed carrots and change into her pink crepe . It was dancing-school day , and they were to go , though , because of traffic and people already shoaling the streets , they were to leave early and take a cab . They were an hour getting to the place , normally a short ride away , for not only were cars and buses creeping bumper to bumper , but people trailed heedlessly between them , poking their grin-split faces into cars , swarming on the platforms and roofs of the buses , as if on this one day bodies were more indestructible than machines . Inside the brownstone which housed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little anterooms where private pupils received coaching in " toe , " or young men and women initiated each other into the wicked mysteries of the Turkey Trot , were dark and quiet . In the grand ballroom , the rows of gilt chairs , where the mothers usually knitted and watched , were empty , but a few mothers clustered around Mr. Duryea , a loose-jointed , very tall man whose length seemed the more exaggerated because all significant detail  --  toupee , dental plate , ribboned eyeglass  --  was crowded together at the top . Now he detached himself from the twittering group , clapped his hands , and the lesson began . No commotion in the street was to interfere with the verity of the two-step , the waltz . At the end of the lesson , however , Mr. Duryea , pairing off the pupils , presented the girl of each couple with a single Americanp202Beauty rose , from the long stem of which dripped streamers of red , white , and blue . As often had been the case before , he had left out Hester @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pianist they were off , for chorus after chorus of a bounding , exultant waltz , Mr. Duryea bending low so that Hester might approximate the correct position with her arms , in her fist the rose of peace . Back in the returning cab , Hester held the bruised rose thoughtfully against her skirt , as one who was not easily to be tricked into believing that pink crepe and roses were her just and personal due . She glanced over at her mother . Sirens and whistles were keening overhead ; as they drove slowly past a church they heard the continuous shrike-shrike of its bell . Her mother , holding her coat tightly around her , stared out fearfully at the crowds which caromed in the streets . Hester would not have been surprised if she had said , " Now that this has happenedI must see about getting the baby born , " but her mother said nothing . " Is the war really and truly over ? " said Hester . " Indeed it is , indeed it is , " said her mother , still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the curb nearestthe cab . One of them , an elderly man , rose painfully , scrabblingfor his hat . Hester 's fingers tightened on the mauled rose . She put her hand on the fur band of her mother 's sleeve , then drew it back . There was no use asking her again about Mr. Katz . Just before they got out of the cab at their door , her hand crept out again and touched the sleeve . " Do you suppose . . . do you suppose it 's because I 'm the best  --  that Mr. Duryea dances with me ? " Hier mother , fumbling for change , looked up as if she were looking over the rims of eyeglasses , although she wore none . " Might be , " she said , and gave her a pat to hurry her out of the cab . " But it 's more likely because you 're far and away the tallest. "  |p203In  the weeks after the Armistice , the city faded slowly through an anticlimactic New Year into the liverish restlessness of off-season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sparrows seemed to idle in the trees , and through days the color of flat soda water one saw more clearly the chapped curbstones of the streets . At the Elkins ' there was quiet , too ; even the number of family visitors had fallen off . A nurse had come to stay , whose only function seemed to be the arranging in the spare room of packages which arrived constantly , or to watch , squinting , while Mrs. Elkin , who spent most of her days in a wrapper , sat nibbling shamefacedly from little plates , or even from paper bags . Mornings Mr. Elkin could hardly be got out of the house , and he came home earlier and earlier , stopping to kiss Hester as she played , for the first time unsupervised , with the gangs of children in the streets . There , as in the papers read aloud at the Elkin dinner table , the talk was all of a great victory parade with which the city was to greet General O'Ryan and the victorious Twenty-seventh . At Madison Square , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Honored Dead . The Washington Arch was to be transformed into an electrified version of the Arc de Triomphe . Fifth Avenue was to have arches hung with glass jewels , in front of the longest continuous grandstand in history . And here , in the matter of the grandstand , history reached out to the Elkins ' dinner table . For according to the outcry in the papers , in spite of all that welter of plaster and wood and glass , no scats in the grandstand had been provided for those wounded soldiers who had been returned to their country in a condition which preventedtheir being honored either as part of the line of march  --  or in Madison Square . A group of merchants whose places of business fronted on Fifth Avenue had arranged , angrily and proudly , to accommodate these . Oakley and Company had been allotted four . On the morning of the parade , Hester , waking before it wasp204light , heard the milkman 's horse clopping in the street below . By the time she reached the window it had vanished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its hoofs and the lurch of the wagon as it stopped far down the block . The growing morning had a glinting change in it ; there was a green trickinessin the March air , and paper scraps scuffled high above the streets . She dressed hurriedly , without calling for help in buttoningthe backs of her camisole and sailor dress . Dragging a chair to the closet , she took from a high shelf a blue serge cape and a Milan straw hat with a broad band trailing from its rear . With luck , since her mother was not to be of the party watchingthe parade from the Oakley and Company premises , no one would notice that Hester was not wearing her winter coat and had substituted for woolen knee socks the short , pale silk ones which were always the true demarcation of spring . At the breakfast table , occupied only by her father and the nurse , no one spoke . The nurse looked at them with that sliteyedremoteness with which she regarded their family life , as if she were telling herself and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for my patient . " Mr. Elkin ate abstractedly , fidgeting without his newspaper , which had not yet arrived . They were to go in the touring car , for which they had a special permit . The streets were to be closed to all downtown traffic by eight . Downstairs , the open car was waiting , the two aunts , here this time by invitation , already in the back seat . Hester got in between them , noting with disappointment that , except for the veils , they were dressed much as usual : Flora in the violent stripings and trembling arrays of jet on which hardly any extra would be noticeable , and Mamie in that lofty dowdiness which exempted her from style . " How 's Hattie ? " said Flora . " Wish I did n't have to go , " said Mr. Elkin , getting in with the driver , " but the nurse is with her . " " Any time ? "  | " Any time . " " Is n't this child dressed rather thin ? " said Mamie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hester squeezed down as far as possible between the aunts . Near her left ear , the tiny percussions of Flora 's jet went on and on in a rhythm that aped the car 's , then paused . " What are we stopping for ? " said Flora . Hester , sitting up , saw that they had pulled up in front of one of the tenements on Amsterdam Avenue . " I thought I better get the Katzes there with us , " said Mr. Elkin . " Oh good God , Joe , " said Flora . " I know , I know , " he answered . " Pull down those two extra seats , will you . Hester , you go on in and tell them we 're here . It 's the ground floor right . " He pointed up at a window . " Just knock and tell them . I do n't think there 's a bell . " Hester went up the stoop and into a vestibule floored with linoleum , in it a great worn hole . The door groaned closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose sharply in front of her , their risers just visible . Far above , at least four flights higher , a skylight glimmered . There was no definite sound , but the building murmured , nevertheless , with the unseen nearness of people . The riband hanging down her back rustled in a steady , poking draught , and she flipped it quickly forward over her shoulder . A door at the right had a glass pane at the top , over which lozenge-patterned paper had been pasted . She knocked . She heard the tinkle of a plate or a spoon being pushed back , a creak , a tread  --  all the noises , begging for mystery , which sounded so exciting from behind closed doors . The door opened and Mrs. Katz stuck her head out on a level with Hester 's . Her woolly fringe caught on the brim of the straw hat , and Hester looked for a moment straight through Mrs. Katz 's spectacles at eyes which rolled like large blue immiesbehind them.  | " Annnnh ! " said Mrs. Katz , clapping her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door . " Katz ! Katz , they are here . The child is here . Come , Katz ! " In the room , there was so much , so fantastically much , that at first Hester could not untangle Mr. Katz from the rest . This was not merely the furniture , which seemed to consist of innumerablesmall mounds , so swagged with throws and coverlets and scarves that tables could not be told from chairs . The walls , the surfaces of the mounds , the ceiling , from which objects hung on strings , the very air was crammed with such a miscellanythat Hester 's eyes could not take it in , but had to stop , blinking , on one thing , until recognition set in . This thing resolveditself into Mr. Katz , who lay on one of the larger mounds , looking vaguely in front of him . He was dressed as he had been at the garden party , except for a wide collar of flannelwhich was tied around his neck with two long ears sticking up behind . " Annnnh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He has with the throat . " Still nodding , she scuttled to Mr. Katz 's side and began pecking at him with little croons and pats . " Up , Katz . Come . Up ! " Hester stared at one of the walls of the corner in which Mr. Katz lay . It was tacked from top to bottom with scraps of lace , colored and plain , pleated and flat , fanned out straight or puffed in bows that quivered with dust . On a shelf above his head , several yards of it were festooned over drapery cards . Betweenthese there was a signed picture of the banquet variety , and a placard which said Henkel Brothers . Fine Laces and Veilings . Beneath the shelf , almost touched by one of Mr. Katz 's flannel ears , there was a collar and cuff set , tacked in dainty alignment , as if waiting for a neck and two wrists to sprout neatly into place out of the wall . Hester looked at the other side of the corner . This wall was crosshatched with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranged , almost there tinkled , an army of china trifles : Dutch boys , pagodas , slippers filled with pincushions , tankards and bud vases gilded with the names of towns or painted with simpering girls whose ringlets ended in a curl flowing artlessly over a shoulder . Among these , too , there were pictures , and one large placard  --  Weinstein and Gaby . Jobbers to the trade . Hester turned on her heel . Here was a far corner devoted to buttons , there , beyond it , objects she could not identify . Each section had its photographs and placards . Even among the things which swung from the ceiling  --  an assortment of feathers  --  there was a sizable plume to which a placard had been pinned . On the mantelpiece , arranged as in a showcase , there was something  --  familiar . " Katz ! " said the crooning voice behind her . " Mr. Elkin is waiting . On you he depends , Katz . " At the sound of her father 's name , the array on the mantelpiecemerged and made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oakley and Company , were samples of all its products . Here were the bottles with their intricate labels : Lilac , Parma Violet , Coreopsis of Japan , and Triple Essence of California Rose . On tripods between them were the " compacts , " small rounds of satin centered with moire rosebuds , each box containinga hard cake of powder , or a flaming oval of orange or purplish rouge . There was even a display of one of Mr. Elkin 's transient ventures  --  tiny vials of rosy or greenish liquid ( each with a brass clip at its back ) , which had been designed to hook onto a lady 's corselette or inside the lacy masses of her decolletage , there to dispel a mysterious fragrance as she breathed  --  but which , Hester knew , had somehow or other " not caught on . " Set in the center of all this , flanked by many gilded cardboardtrade-marks , were two pictures . She moved nearer . One was a picture of the Oakley office . The other was a picture of herself . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downtown  --  of herself at the age of three , inp208white corduroy bonnet with lining frilling her solemn face , coat with belt absurdly far below the waist , the hem just touching the kid uppers of her patent boots . Scrawled in her father 's fancy hand , on this copy , however , an inscription ran right across the boots : To Mr. and Mrs. Katz . Regards . From the Coreopsis Kid . " Annnnh . Now ! " said Mrs. Katz in a failing voice . Hester turned . Mr. Katz was on his feet . He still had a vague look of waiting for instruction , but he was vertical . " Come , " said Mrs. Katz . She stepped nimbly in front of Mr. Katz , as if she were used to shielding him from notice . " You looking samples ? " She pointed a knotty paw . " When Katz was in Lace . " She pointed again . " When he was Souvenirs . " " What are those ? " Hester indicated the far corner . " Findings , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She followed Hester 's gaze to the mantel . " Annnnh , " said Mrs. Katz , folding her hands . " The Company . " Behind her , Mr. Katz jackknifed so suddenly that Hester thought he had fallen over , until she saw that he was tugging at several packages which were piled on the floor under the mantel . " Nab , nah , Katz. " said Mrs. Katz , with a fretful sob . Shc tweaked at the flannel . " Today is holiday , remember , Katz ? " There was a sharp rat-a-tat at the door . " Annnnh , Gott , " Mrs. Katz sighed , and pulled Mr. Katz upright . She pressed her face close to Hester 's " Sometimes Katz can not think how to come any place but home . Versteh ? " she whispered . " So he brings them here , the bundles , and we go out togedder . Him to carry . Me to show where . " There was another , louder knock at the door . " Like podnership , see ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against her pleading , wrinkled muzzle . " Sh-h-h . You are good girl , nu ? " Then she scurried to the door . " Yes , yes ! We arep209ready ! " she cried , and flung the door open , bobbing low behind it , almost in a curtsy . " Well , please come on then , " said Mr. Elkin , in a voice more indulgent than his expression . " Or we 'll never get there . " He looked at Mr. Katz , shook his head , then took Katz by the arm and led him out the door . Hester and Mrs. Katz waited on the stoop while Mr. Katz was inserted in the front seat of the car , next to the driver . Mrs. Katz put a hand on Hester 's upper arm and squeezed it . " Big strong girl , " she muttered . She nodded closer , so that Hester again looked through the spectacles at the round , swimming eyes . " Sometimes I carry , too , " whispered Mrs. Katz . Mrs. Katz was to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mulishness of the timid , she pleaded the anxiety of her " podnership " and was finally allowed to get up front . From the back seat only her nodding bonnet was visible , next to the tartan shawl she had wrapped carefully around Katz . Mr. Elkin got in one of the small seats facing the back , turningaround to hand the driver a large engraved card . " Drive down to Washington Square and back up , whichever way they 'll let you go , " he said . " I think this will get you through . " Ile sat Hester on the little seat next to him and cradled her hand in his lap . " I want Hester to see the Arch . " It was still very early . The car made good headway , creepingalong the battered streets near the East River . " How many boys will you have , Joe ? " said Flora . " Four , they said . " " They say some of them . . . " Mamie said nervously . " Basketcases . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. Elkin gnawed his mustache . ' They would n't . " Hester saw the soldiers in her mind , baskets over their poor , mad heads , with holes woven for the strange , lucent eyes . " Joe , " Flora 's voice cracked , parrotlike , above the motor hum.  |p210She  motioned with her chin toward the front seat . " Is he always like that ? " she said , lowering her voice . " Really , you ought to realize . " " On and off , " said her father . " He 's not much use around theoffice any more . Still pretty fair on deliveries , though . " Hester lowered her eyes to the hand held in her father 's andcounted her breaths . In , out . In , out . " Could n't you mail ? " said Mamie . " Oh . . . " said her father , looking vaguely out the window . " There 's always something . " " You mean you see to it there 's something , " said Flora . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these days . " Mr. Elkin looked patiently back at the two who had been part of the dead weight for years . " They have n't a soul . I 'm trying to get them into a home . " " Daddy , " said IIester , " what is the Corylopsis Kid ? " " The Coreopsis Kid ? " Mr. Elkin squeezed her hand with an absent smile . " That 's you , m'dear . " " Me ? " Mr. Elkin nodded over her head at the aunts . " Louis Orenstein , was n't it , who started it with that telegram the day she was born . Three cheers for the Coreopsis Kid . ' " " What a fool you were that day , Joe , " said Flora , her jet quivering with chuckles . " What an old fool . " " Why not ? " said Mr. Elkin . " I 'd waited a long time for that day . " " And the telegrams you sent out later , " said Mamie with a pursed smile . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Company and the Coreopsis Kid . ' " " Well , the line 's known from coast to coast , " said Mr. Elkin . " And so am I. " He looked down at Hester . " And so is Hester . When I 'm on the road I get it all the time . How 's the CoreopsisKid , Joe ? ' " Suddenly , turning a corner , they were at the Arch . It gleamedp211in front of them like an enormous croquet wicket massed with jewels . Then it was hidden by the blue bulk of a policeman . When he saw the card , his face cleared . " I 'll get you over to the curb , sir . You 'll have to wait there a bit , but we 'll get you through . " At the curb , the people packed swelling behind the barrier looked enviously into the long car . The two aunts held up their bosoms , looking stiffly ahead with the hauteur of influence . The car edged into a line of others and stopped , pointing straight at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ west , phalanx after phalanx of waiting uniforms quivered in the early morningsun , Here and there commands sparked suddenly above a continuous surf of sound . To the left of the car , a horse curvetted and was reined in , his nostrils distended but still . Hester looked at the Arch . Hung with a dazzle of light , it swayed with the sound of thousands of colors chiming softly together . It kept time with the dazzle in her chest , inside of which a music box tintinnabulated over and over , " Coreopsis ... Coreopsis . . . Coreopsis Kid . " She stood up , and stepped on Mamie 's foot . At Mamie 's sharp yelp , she sat down again . " When that baby comes , " said Mamie , nursing her foot , " I know someone whose nose is going to be out of joint . " " Mamie , " said Mr. Elkin , " sometimes you have n't the sense of a mule . " Hester stared at Mamie . Idly , she noted how well her aunt 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small for anything more , but her own answer came from far below the stare . " I do n't know , " she said . " I guess Daddy can afford us all . " A murmur from the crowd drowned out her father 's guffaw . The lines of soldiers tautened , each to a single glitter . Waves of brass washed over them , and the glitter moved with the drums . Now everyone in the crowd was throwing something  --   |p212|packs  of cigarettes , oranges , paper rosettes , and streamers of tricolore . The aunts dug down in a hamper and brought out things to throw , too . From the windows around the Square , confetti flaked and fell through the air . Some of the brilliant bits spiraled onto the car , and Hester , leaning against her father , raised her face to receive them , as she did in winter with the first , slow feathers of snow . Her father held her , as he would uphold them all . And there was no other quite so dashing name in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon them . Its clangor invaded her chest . She burst into tears . " What . . . what ? " said her father , bending down . " I loved it , " she whispered back . " I loved the war . " But her father shook his head , his smile half turning into a frown . Mrs. Katz leaned over the back seat . Her arms and hands were crammed full , and her muzzle was pleated with glee , with the joy of having things to throw away . She pressed an orange into Hester 's hand . " Throw ! " she said , nodding her woolen lamb-curls . " Throw ! " Hester cupped the orange in her hand . It was round , perfect , like the world at this moment . If there was a flaw in it , it could not yet be seen . She held onto it for as long as she could . Then , closing her eyes tight , she threw it.  |p215WHEN  the scream came , from downstairs in the streetfive flights below her bedroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenancy of the flat had becomethe lightest of sleepers , stumbled up , groped her way past theempty second twin bed that stood nearer the window , andlooked out . There was nothing to be seen of course  --  theapartment house she was in , though smartly kept up to thestandards of the neighborhood , dated from the era of frontfire escapes , and the sound , if it had come at all , had come fromdirectly beneath them . From other half-insomniac nights sheknew that the hour must be somewhere between three andfour in the morning . The " all-night " doorman who guardedthe huge facade of the apartment house opposite had retired , per custom , to some region behind its canopy ; the one downthe block at the corner of First , who blew his taxi-whistle soincessantly that she had for some nights mistaken it for atraffic policeman 's , had been quiet for a long time . Even thewhite-shaded lamp that burned all day and most of the nighton the top floor of the little gray town house sandwiched between the tall buildings across the way  --  an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour the wide expanseof the avenue , Fifty-seventh Street at its easternmost end , looked calm , reassuring and amazingly silent for one of themain arteries of the city . The cross-town bus service had longsince ceased ; the truck traffic over on First made only an occasionaldim rumble . If she went into the next room , where there was a French window opening like a double door , and leaned out ,  |p216absurd  idea , in her nightgown , she would see , far down to the right , the lamps of a portion of the Queensboro Bridge , quietly necklaced on the night . In the blur beneath them , out of range but comfortable to imagine , the beautiful cul-de-sac of Sutton Square must be musing , Edwardian in the starlight , its one antique bow-front jutting over the river shimmering below . And in the facades opposite her , lights were still spotted here and there , as was always the case , even in the small hours , in New York . Other consciousnesses were awake , a vigil of anonymousneighbors whom she would never know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utterly alone . All was silent . No , she must have dreamed it , reinterpreted in her doze some routine sound , perhaps the siren of the police car that often keened through this street but never stopped , no doubt on its way to the more tumultuous West Side . Until the death of her husband , companion of twenty years , eight months ago , her ability to sleep had always been healthy and immediate ; since then it had gradually , not unnaturally deteriorated , but this was the worst ; she had never done this before . For she could still hear very clearly the character of the sound , or rather its lack of one  --  a long , oddly sustained note , then a shorter one , both perfectly even , not discernible as a man 's or a woman 's , and without  --  yes , without the color of any emotion  --  surely the sound that one heard in dreams . Never a woman of small midnight fears in either city or country , as a girl she had done settlement work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mining engineer 's wife had nestled peacefully within the shrieking velvet of an Andes night . Not to give herself special marks for this , it was still all the more reason why what she had heard , or thought she had heard , must have been hallucinatory . A harsh word , but she must be stern with herself at the very beginnings of any such , of what could presage the sort of disintegrating widowhood , full of the mouse-fears and softening self-indulgences of the manless , that she could not , would not abide . Scarcely a secondp217or two could have elapsed between that long  --  yes , that was it , soulless  --  cry , and her arrival at the window . And look , down there on the street and upward , everything remained motionless . Not a soul , in answer , had erupted from a doorway . All the fanlights of the lobbies shone serenely . Up above , no one leaned , not a window had flapped wide . After twenty years of living outside of the city , she could still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground  --  she had been born here , and raised . Secretly mourning it , missing it through all the happiest suburban years , she had kept up with it like a scholar , building a red-book of it for herself even through all its savage , incontinent rebuilding . She still knew all its neighborhoods . She knew . And this was one in which such a sound would be policed at once , such a cry serviced at once , if only by doormen running . No , the fault , the disturbance , must be hers . Reaching into the pretty , built-in wardrobe on her right  --  the flat , with so many features that made it more like a house , fireplace , high ceilings , had attracted her from the first for this reason  --  she took out a warm dressing gown and sat down on the bed to put on her slippers . The window was wide open and she meant to leave it that way ; country living had made unbearablethe steam heat of her youth . There was no point to winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always been ones to enjoy the weather as it came . Perhaps she had been unwiseto give up the dog , excuse for walks early and late , outlet for talking aloud  --  the city was full of them . Unwise too , in the self-denuding impulse of loss , to have made herself that solitaryin readiness for a city where she would have to remake friends , and no longer had kin . And charming as this flat was , wooed as she increasingly was by the delicately winning personalityof its unknown , absent owner , Mrs. Berry , by her brica-brac , her cookbooks , even by her widowhood , almost as recent as Mrs. Hazlitt 's own  --  perhaps it would be best to do some/thing about getting the empty second twin bed removed from this room . No doubt Mrs. Berry , fled to London , possibly even residing in the rooms of yet a third woman in search of recommendedchange , would understand . Mrs. Hazlitt stretched her arms , able to smile at this imagined procession of women inhabitingeach other 's rooms , fallen one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How could she have forgotten what anyone who had reached middle age through the normal amount of trouble should know , that the very horizontal position itself of sleep , when one could not , laid one open to every attack from within , on a couch with no psychiatrist to listen but oneself . The best way to meet the horrors was on two feet , vertical . What she meant to do now was to fix herself a sensible hot drink , not coffee , reminiscent of shared midnight snacks , not even tea , but a nursery drink , cocoa . In a lifetime , she thought , there are probably two eras of the sleep that is utterly sound : the nursery sleep ( if one had the lucky kind of childhood I did ) and the sleep next or near the heart and body of the one permanently loved and loving , if one has been lucky enough for that too . I must learn from within , as well as without , that both are over . She stood up , tying her sash more firmly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She listened , rigid . It came exactly as remembered , one shrilled long note , then the shorter second , like a cut-off Amen to the first and of the same timbre , dreadful in its cool , a madnessexpended almost with calm , near the edge of joy . No wonder she had thought of the siren ; this had the same note of terror controlled . One could not tell whether it sped toward a victim or from one . As before , it seemed to come from directly below . Shaking , she leaned out , could see nothing because of the high sill , ran into the next room , opened the French window and all but stood on the fire escape . As she did so , the sound , certainly human , had just ceased ; at the same moment a cab , goingp219slowly down the middle of the avenue , its toplight up , veered directly toward her , as if the driver too had heard , poised there beneath her with its nose pointed toward the curb , then veered sharply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and drove on . Immediately behind it another cab , toplight off , slowed up , performed exactly the same orbit , then it too , with a hasty squeal of brakes , made for the center street and sped away . In the confusion of noises she thought she heard the grind of a window-sash coming down , then a slam  --  perhaps the downstairs door of the adjoining set of flats , or of this one . Dropping to her knees , she leaned both palms on the floor-level lintel of the window and peered down through the iron slats of her fire escape and the successive ones below . Crouched that way , she could see straight back to the building line . To the left , a streetlamp cast a pale , even glow on empty sidewalk and the free space of curb either side of a hydrant ; to the right , the shadows were obscure , but motionless . She saw nothing to conjure into a half-expected human bundle lying still , heard no footfall staggering or slipping away . Not more than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cry . Tilting her head up at the facades opposite , she saw that their simple pattern of lit windows seemed the same . While she stared , one of the squares blotted out , then another , both on floors not too high to have heard . Would no one , having heard , attend ? Would she ? Standing up , her hand on the hasp of the French window , she felt herself still shaking , not with fear , but with the effort to keep herself from in some way heeding that cry . Again she told herself that she had been born here , knew the city 's ways , had not the auslander 's incredulity about some of them . These ways had hardened since her day , people had warned her , to an indifference beyond that of any civilized city ; there were no " good " neighborhoods now , none of any kind really , except the half-hostile enclosure that each family must build for itself.  |p220She  had discounted this , knowing unsentimentally what city life was ; even in the tender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , human ones , that the most responsiblepeople , the kindest , had shrugged away , saying , " Nothing , dear . Something outside . " What she had not taken into account was her own twenty years of living elsewhere , where such a cry in the night would be succored at once if only for gossip 's sake , if only because one gave up privacy  --  anonymity  --  forever , when one went to live in a house on a road . If only , she thought , holding herself rigid to stop her trembling , because  it would be the cry of someone one knew . Nevertheless , it took all her strength not to rush downstairs , to hang on to the handle , while in her mind 's eye she ran out of her apartment door , remembering to take the key , pressed the elevator button and waited , went down at the car 's deliberate pace . After that there would be the inner , buzzer door to open , then at last the door to the outside . No , it would take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the phone , by the time police could come or she could find the number of the superintendent in his back basement  --  and when either answered , what would she say ? She looked at the fire escape . Not counting hers , there must be three others between herself and the street . Whether there was a ladder extending from the lowest one she could not remember ; possibly one hung by one 's hands and dropped to the ground . Years ago there had been more of them , even the better houses had had them in their rear areaways , but she had never in her life seen one used . And this one fronted direct on the avenue . It was this that brought her to her senses  --  the vision of herself in her blue robe creeping down the front of a building on Fifty-seventh street , hanging by her hands until she dropped to the ground . She shut the long window quickly , leaning her weight against it to help the slightly swollen frame into place , and turned the handle counterclockwise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place with a thumpp221she had never noticed before but already seemed familiar . Probably , she thought , sighing , it was the kind of sound  --  old hardwareon old wood  --  that more often went with a house . In the kitchen , over her cocoa , she shook herself with a reminiscent tremble , in the way one did after a narrow escape . It was a gesture made more often to a companion , an auditor . Easy enough to make the larger gestures involved in cutting clown one 's life to the pattern of the single ; the selling of a house , the arranging of income or new occupation . Even the abnegation of sex had a drama that lent one strength , made one hold up one 's head as one saw oneself traveling a clear , melancholy line . It was the small gestures for which there was no possible sublimation , the sudden phrase , posture  --  to no auditor , the constant clueing of identity in another 's  --  its cessation . " Dear me , " she would have said  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they had often planned , and lie would have just returned from an overnight business trip  --  " what do you suppose I 'd have done , Sam , if I 'd gone all the way , in my housecoat , really found myself outside ? Funny how the distinction between outdoors and in breaks down in the country . I 'd forgotten how absolute it is here  --  with so many barriers between . " Of course , she thought , that 's the simple reason why here , in the city , the sense of responsibility has to weaken . Who could maintain it , through a door , an elevator , a door and a door , toward everyone , anyone , who screamed ? Perhapsthat was the real reason she had come here , she thought , washing the cup under the faucet . Where the walls are soundproofedthere are no more " people next door " with their ready " casserole " pity , at worst with the harbored glow of their own family life peering from their averted eyelids like the lamplight from under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best way to learn how to live alone was to come to the place where people really were . She set the cup out for the morning and added a plate and ap222spoon . It was wiser not to let herself deteriorate to the utterly casual ; besides , the sight of them always gave her a certain pleasure , like a greeting , if only from herself of the night before . Tomorrow she had a meeting , of one of the two hospital boards on which , luckily for now , she had served for years . There was plenty more of that kind of useful occupation available and no one would care a hoot whether what once she had done for conscience ' sake she now did for her own . The meeting was not scheduled until two . Before that she would manage to inquire very discreetly , careful not to appear either eccentric or too friendly , both of which made city peopleuneasy , as to whether anyone else in the building had heard what she had . This too she would do for discipline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sound had been real . The next morning at eight-thirty , dressed to go out except for her coat , she waited just inside her door for one or the other of the tenants on her floor to emerge . Her heart pounded at the very queerness of what she was doing , but she overruled it ; if she did feel somewhat too interested , too much as if she were embarking on a chase , then let her get it out of her system at once , and have done . How to do so was precisely what she had considered while dressing . The problem was not to make too many inquiries , too earnest ones , and not to seem to be making any personal overture , from which people would natu rally withdraw . One did not make inconvenient , hothouse friend ships in the place one lived in , here . Therefore she had decided to limit her approaches to three  --  the first to the girl who lived in the adjacent apartment , who could usually be encounteredat this hour and was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the building  --  back tenants were lest likely to have heard . For the rest , she must trust to luck . And whatever the outcome , she would not let herself pursue the matter beyond today . She opened the door a crack and listened . Still too early.  |p223Actually  the place , being small  --  six floors of four or five flats each  --  had a more intimate feeling than most . According to the super 's wife , Mrs. Stump , with whom she had had a chat or two in the hall , many of the tenants , clinging to ceiling rents in what had become a fancier district , had been here for years , a few for the thirty since the place had been built . This would account for so many middle-aged and elderly , seemingly either single or the remnants of families  --  besides various quiet , well-manneredwomen who , like herself , did not work , she had noticedat times two men who were obviously father and son , two others who , from their ages and nameplate , noticed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only child in the place  --  a subdued little girl of about eight . As soon as a tenant of long standing vacated or died , Mrs. Stump had added , the larger units were converted to smaller , and this would account for the substratum of slightly showier or younger occupants : two modishblondes , a couple of homburged " decorator " types  --  all more in keeping with the newly sub-theatrical , antique-shop character of the neighborhood  --  as well as for the " career girl " on her floor . Mrs. Berry , who from evidences in the flat should be something past forty like herself , belonged to the first group , having been here , with her husband of course until recently , since just after the war . A pity that she , Mrs. Berry , who from her books , her one charming letter , her own situation , might have been just the person to understand , even share Mrs. Hazlitt'sreaction to the event of last night , was not here . But this was nonsense ; if she were , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought again of the chain of women , sighed , and immediatelychid herself for this new habit of sighing , as well as for this alarming mound of gratuitous information she seemed to have acquired , in less than a month , about people with whom she was in no way concerned . At that moment she heard the door next hers creak open . Quickly she put on her coat , opened her door and bent to pick up the morning paper . The girlp224coming out stepped back , dropping one of a pile of boxes she was carrying . Mrs. Hazlitt returned it to her , pressed the buttonfor the elevator , and when it came , held the door . It was the girl she had seen twice before ; for the first time they had a nice exchange of smiles . " Whoops , I 'm late , " said the girl , craning to look at her watch . " Me too , " said Mrs. Hazlitt , as the cage slid slowly down . She drew breath . " Overslept , once I did get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you hear all that fuss , must have been around three or four ? " She waited hopefully for the answer : Why yes indeed , what on earth was it , did you ? " Uh-uh , " said the girl , shaking her head serenely . " ' Fraid the three of us sleep like a log , that 's the trouble . My roommates are still at it , lucky stiffs . " She checked her watch again , was first out of the elevator , nodded her thanks when Mrs. Hazlitt hurried to hold the buzzer door for her because of the boxes , managed the outer door herself , and departed . Mrs. Hazlitt walked briskly around the corner to the bakery , came back with her bag of two brioches , and reentered . Imagine , there are three of them , she thought , and I never knew . Well , I envy them their log . The inner door , usually locked , was propped open . Mrs. Stump was on her knees just behind it , washing the marble floor , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , not luxurious but up to a firmly well-bred standard , just the sort a woman like Mrs. Berry would have , that she herself , when the sublease was over , would like to find . Nodding to Mrs. Stump , she went past her to the row of brass mail slots , pretending to search her own although she knew it was too early , weighing whether she ought to risk wasting one of her three chances on her . " Mail do n't come till ten , " said Mrs. Stump from behind her . " Yes , I know , " said Mrs. Hazlitt , recalling suddenly that theyp225had had this exchange before . " But I forgot to check yesterday . " " Yesterday vass holiday . " " Oh , so it was . " Guiltily Mrs. Hazlitt entered the elevator and faced the door , relieved when it closed . The truth was that she had known yesterday was a holiday and had checked the mail anyway . The truth was that she often did this even on Sundays here , often even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long expanse of a day when she either flinched from the daily walk that was too dreary to do alone on Sunday , or had not provided herself with a ticket to something . One had to tidy one 's hair , spruce a bit for the possible regard of someone in the hall , and when she did see someone , although of course they never spoke , she always returned feeling refreshed , reaffirmed . Upstairs again , she felt that way now ; her day had begun in the eyes of others , as a day should . She made a few phone calls to laundry and bank , and felt even better . Curious how , when one lived alone , one began to feel that only one 's own consciousness held up the world , and at the very same time that only an incursion into the world , or a recognition from it , made one continue to exist at all . There was another phone call she might make , to a friend up in the country , who had broken an ankle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed it more . This was yet another discipline  --  not to become a phone bore . The era when she herself had been a victim of such , had often thought of the phone as a nuisance , now seemed as distant as China . She looked at the clock  --  time enough to make another pot of coffee . With it she ate a brioche slowly , then with the pleasant sense of hurry she now had so seldom , another . At ten sharp she went downstairs again , resolving to take her chance with whoever might be there . As she emerged from the elevator she saw that she was in luck ; the owner of a big brown poodle  --  a tall , well set up man of sixty or so  --  was bent over hisp226mail slot while the dog stood by . It was the simplest of matters to make on overture to the poodle , who was already politely nosing the palm she offered him , to expose her own love of the breed , remarking on this one 's exceptional manners , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in general , to a particular noise . " Ah well , Coco 's had stage training , " said his owner , in answer to her compliments . She guessed that his owner might have had the same ; he had that fine , bravura face which aging actors of another generation often had , a trifle shallow for its years perhaps but very fine , and he inclined toward her with the same majestic politeness as his dog , looking into her face very intently as she spoke , answering her in the slender , semiBritishaccent she recalled from matinee idols of her youth . She had to repeat her question on the noise . This time she firmly gave the sound its name  --  a scream , really rather an unusual scream . " A scream ? " The man straightened . She thought that for a moment he looked dismayed . Then he pursed his lips very judiciously , in almost an acting-out of that kind of resposc . " Come to think of it , ye-es , I may have heard something . " IIe squared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over . And Coco 's a city dog , very blase fellow . Rather imagine he did too . " He tipped his excellent homburg . " Good morning , " he added , with sudden reserve , and turned away , giving a flick to the dog 's leash that started the animal off with his master behind him . " Good morning , " she called after them , " and thanks for the tip on where to get one like Coco . " Coco looked back at her , but his master , back turned , disentangling the leash from the doorknob , did not , and went out without answering . So I 've done it after all , she thought . Too friendly . Especially too friendly since I 'm a woman . Her face grew hot at this probableestimate of her  --  gushy woman chattering over-brightly ,  |p227lingering  in the hall . Bore of a woman who heard things at night , no doubt looked under the bed before she got into it . No , she thought , there was something  --  when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter , still clear , she felt her resolve stiffen . Also  --  what a dunce she was being  --  there were the taxis . Taxis , one of them occupied , did not veer , one after the other , on an empty street , without reason . Emboldened , she bent to look at the man 's mailbox . The name , Reginald Warwick , certainly fitted her imaginary dossier , but that was not what gave her pause . Apartment 3A . Hers was 5A . He lived in the front , two floors beneath her , where he must have heard . As she inserted the key in her apartment door , she heard the telephone ringing , fumbled the key and dropped it , then had to open the double lock up above . All part of the city picture , she thought resentfully , remembering their four doors , never locked , in the country  --  utterly foolhardy , never to be dreamed of here . Even if she had , there were Mrs. Berry 's possessions to be considered , nothing extraordinary , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had inherited or acquired herself  --  in the matter of bric-a-brac alone there was really quite a kinship between them . The phone was still ringing as she entered . She raced toward it eagerly . It was the secretary of the hospital board , telling her that this afternoon 's meeting was put off . " Oh . . . oh dear , " said Mrs. Hazlitt . " I mean  --  I 'm so sorry to hear about Mrs. Levin . Hope it 's nothing serious . " " I really could n't say , " said the secretary . " But we 've enough for a quorum the week after . " She rang off . Mrs. Hazlitt put down the phone , alarmed at the sudden sinking of her heart over such a minor reversal . She had looked forward to seeing people of course , but particularly to spending an afternoon in the brightly capable impersonality of the boardroom , among men and women who brought with them a sense ofp228indefinable swathes of well-being extending behind them , of such a superfluity of it , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met in that efficient room to dispense what overflowed . The meeting would have been an antidote to that dark , anarchic version of the city which had been obsessing her ; it would have been a reminder that everywhere , on flight after flight of the city 's high , brilliant floors , similar groups of the responsible were convening , could always be applied to , were in command . The phone gave a reminiscent tinkle as she pushed it aside , and she waited , but there was no further ring . She looked at her calendar , scribbled with domestic markings  --  the hairdresser on Tuesday , a fitting for her spring suit , the date when she must appear at the lawyer 's for the closing on the sale of the house . Beyond that she had a dinner party with old acquaintances on the following Thursday , tickets with a woman friend for the Philharmonic on Saturday week . Certainlyshe was not destitute of either company or activity . But the facts were that within the next two weeks , she could look forward to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of intirnacy with people who , within limits , knew " who " she was . A default on either would be felt keenly  --  much more than the collapse of this afternoon 's little  --  prop . Absently she twiddled the dial back and forth . Proportionwas what went first " in solitary " ; circling one 's own small platform in space , the need for speech mute in one 's own throat , one developed an abnormal concern over the night-cries of others . No , she thought , remembering the board meeting , those high convocations of the responsible , I 've promised  --  Lord knows who , myself , somebody . She stood up and gave herself a smart slap on the buttock . " Come on , Millie , " she said , using the nickname her husband always had . " Get on with it . " She started to leave the room , then remained in its center , hand at her mouth , wondering . Talking aloud to oneself was more common than admitted ; almost everyone did . It wasp229merely that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Around eleven o'clock , making up a bundle of lingerie , she went down to the basement where there was a community washing machine , set the machine 's cycle , and went back upstairs . Forty minutes later she went through the same routine , shifting the wet clothes to the dryer . At one o'clock she returned for the finished clothes and carried them up . This made six trips in all , but at no time had she met anyone en route ; it was Saturday afternoon , perhaps a bad time . At two she went out to do her weekend shopping . The streets were buzzing , the women in the supermarket evidently laying in enough stores for a visitation of giants . Outside the market , a few kids from Third Avenue always waited in the hope of tips for carrying , and on impulse , although her load was small , she engaged a boy of about ten . On the way home , promising him extra for waiting , she stopped at the patisserie where she always lingered for the sheer gilt-and-chocolate gaiety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , again on impulse , an eclair for the boy . Going up in the elevator they encountered the mother and small girl , but she had never found any pretext for addressingthat glum pair , the mother engaged as usual in a low , toneless tongue-lashing of the child . Divorcee , Mrs. Ilazlitt fancied , and no man in the offing , an inconvenient child . In the kitchen , she tipped the boy and offered him the pastry . After an astonished glance , he wolfed it with a practical air , peering at her furtively between bites , and darted off at once , looking askance over his shoulder at her " Sec you next Saturday , maybe . " Obviously he had been brought up to believe that only witches dispensed free gingerbread . In front of the bathroom mirror , Mrs. Hazlitt , tidying up before her walk , almost ritual now , to Sutton Square , regarded her image , not yet a witch 's but certainly a fool 's , a country-cookie-jar fool 's . " Oh well , you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , and for some reason this cheered her . Before leaving , she wentp230over face and costume with the laborious attention she always gave them nowadays before going anywhere outside . Again , when she rode down , she met no one , but she walked with bracing step , making herself take a circuitous route for health 's sake , all the way to Bloomingdale 's , then on to Park and around again , along the Fifty-eighth Street bridge pass , the dejectedly frivolous shops that lurked near it , before she let herself approach the house with the niche with the little statue of Dante in it , then the Square . Sitting in the Square , the air rapidly blueing now , lapping her like reverie , she wondered whether any of the residents of the windows surrounding her had noticed her almost daily presence , half hoped they had . Before it became too much of a habit , of course , she would stop coming . Meanwhile , if she took off her distance glasses , the scene before her , seen through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , blue and green lights of a barge going at its tranced pace downriver  --  was the very likeness of a corner of the Chelsea embankment , glimpsed throughout a winter of happy teatime windows seven years ago , from a certainangle below Battersea Bridge . Surely it was blameless to remember past happiness if one did so without self-pity , better still , of course , to be able to speak of it to someone in an even , healing voice . Idly she wondered where Mrs. Berry was living in London . The flat in Cheyne Walk would have just suited her . " just the thing for you , " she would have said to her had she known her . " The Sebrings still let it every season . We always meant to go back . " Her watch said five and the air was chilling . She walked rapidly home through the evening scurry , the hour of appointments , catching its excitement as she too hurried , half-persuaded of her own appointment , mythical but still possible , with someone as yet unknown . Outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been entering it from the westerly side . Now , approaching from the east , she saw that the fire escape on this side of the entrance did end in a ladder ,  |p231about  four feet above her . Anyone moderately tall , like herself , would have had an easy drop of it , as she would have done last night . Shaking her head at that crazy image , she looked up at the brilliant hives all around her . Lights were cramming in , crowding on , but she knew too much now about their nighttime progression , their gradual decline to a single indifferent string on that rising , insomniac silence in which she might lie until morning , dreading to hear again what no one else would appear to have heard . Scaring myself to death , she thought ( or muttered ? ) , and in the same instant resolved to drop all limits , go down to the basement and interrogate the Stumps , sit on the bench in the lobby and accost anyone who came in , ring doorbellsif necessary , until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Excuse me , " said someone . She turned . A small , frail , elderly woman , smiling timidly , waited to get past her through the outer door . " Oh  --  sorry , " said Mrs. Hazlitt . " Why  --  good evening ! " she added with a rush , an enormous rush of relief . " Here  --  let me , " she said more quietly , opening the door with a numb sense of gratitude for having been tugged back from the brink of what she saw now , at the touch of a voice , had been panic . For here was a tenant , unaccountably forgotten , with whom she was almoston speaking terms , a gentle old sort , badly crippled with arthritis , for whom Mrs. Hazlitt had once or twice unlocked the inner door . She did so now . " Thank you , my dear  --  my hands are that knobbly . " There was the trace of brogue that Mrs. Hazlitt had noticed before . The old woman , her gray hair sparse from the disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceal the skulls of old ladies , her broadtail coat not new but excellently maintained , gave off the comfortable essence , pleasing as rosewater , of one who had been serenely protected all her life . Unmarried , for she had that strangely deducible aura about her even before one noted the lack of ring , she had also ap232certain simpleness , now almost bygone , of those household women who had never gone to business  --  Mrs. Hazlitt had put her down as perhaps the relict sister of a contractor , or of a school superintendent of the days when the system had been Irish from top to bottom , at the top , of Irish of just this class . The old lady fumbled now with the minute key to her mailbox . " May I ? " " Ah , if you would now . Could n't manage it when I came down . The fingers do n't seem to warm up until evening . It 's 2B . " Mrs. Hazlitt , inserting the key , barely noticed the name  --  Finan. 2B would be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A 's . " And you would be the lady in Mrs. Berry 's . Such a nicely spoken woman , she was . " " Oh yes , is n't she , " said Mrs. Hazlitt . " I mean . . . I just came through the agent . But when you live in a person 's house  --  do you know her ? " " Just to speak . Half as long as me , they 'd lived here . Fifteen years . " The old lady took the one letter Mrs. Hazlitt passed her , the yellow-fronted rent bill whose duplicate she herself had received this morning . " Ah well , we 're always sure of this one , are n't we ? " Nodding her thanks , she shuffled toward the elevator on built-up shoes shaped like hods . " Still , it 's a nice , quiet building , and lucky we are to be in it these days . " There was such a rickety bravery about her , of neat habit long overborne by the imprecisions of age , of dowager hat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key yet living alone , that Mrs. Hazlitt , reluctant to shake the poor , tottery dear further , had to remind herself of the moment before their encounter . " Last night ? " The old blue eyes looked blank , then brightened . " Ah no , I must have taken one of my Seconals . OtherwiseI 'd have heard it surely . Auntie , my niece always says  --   |p233what  if there should be a fire , and you there sleeping away ? ' I ) o what she says , I do sometimes , only to hear every pin drop till morning . " She shook her head , entering the elevator . " Going up ? " " N-no , " said Mrs. Hazlitt . " I  --  have to wait here for a minute . " She sat down on the bench , the token bench that she had never seen anybody sitting on , and watched the car door close on the little figure still shaking its head , borne upward like a fairy godmother , willing but unable to oblige . The car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Someone else was comingdown . No , this is the nadir , Mrs. Hazlitt thought . Whether I heard it or not , I 'm obviously no longer myself . Sleeping pills for me too , though I 've never  --  and no more nonsense . And no more questioning , no matter who . The car door opened . " Wssht ! " said Miss Finan , scuttling out again . " I 've just remembered . Not last night , but two weeks ago . And once before that . A scream , you said ? " Mrs. Hazlitt stood up . Almost unable to speak , for the tears that suddenly wrenched her throat , she described it . " That 's it , just what I told my niece on the phone next morning . Like nothing human , and yet it was . I 'd taken my Seconal too early , so there I was wide awake again , lying there just thinking , when it came . Auntie , ' she tried to tell me , it was just one of the sireens . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very slowly and settled her hat . " The city 's gone down , you know . Not what it was , " she said in a reduced voice , casting a glance over her shoulder , as if whatever the city now was loomed behind her . " But I 've laid awake on this street too many years , I said , not to know what I hear . " She leaned forward . " But  --  she . . . they think I 'm getting old , you know , " she said , in the whisper used to confide the unimaginable . " So . . . well . . . when I heard it again I just did n't tell her . " Mrs. Hazlitt grubbed for her handkerchief , found it and blewp234her nose . Breaking clown , she thought  --  I never knew what a literal phrase it is . For she felt as if all the muscles that usually held her up , knee to ankle , had slipped their knots and were melting her , unless she could stop them , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nervous woman , " she managed to say . " But it was just that no one else seemed to  --  why , there were people with lights on , but they just seemed to ignore . " The old lady nodded absently . " Well , thank God my hearing'sas good as ever . Hmm . Wait till I tell Jennie that ! " She began making her painful way back to the car . Mrs. Hazlitt put out a hand to delay her . " In case it  --  I mean , in case somebody ought to be notified  --  do you have any idea what it was ? " " Oh , I do n't know . And what could we  --  ? " Miss Finan shrugged , eager to get along . Still , gossip was tempting . " I did think  --  " She paused , lowering her voice uneasily . " Like somebody in a fit , it was . We 'd a sexton at church taken that way with epilepsy once . And it stopped short like that , just as if somebody 'd clapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next time I thought  --  no , more like a signal , like somebody calling . You know the things you 'll think at night . " She turned , clearly eager to get away . " But , ought n't we to inquire ? " Mrs. Hazlitt thought of the taxis . " In case it came from this building ? " " This build  --  " For a moment Miss Finan looked scared , her chin trembling , eyes rounded in the misty , affronted stare that the old gave , not to physical danger , but to a new idea swum too late into their ken . Then she drew herself up , all five feet of her bowed backbone . " Not from here it would n't . Across from that big place , maybe . Lots of riffraff there , not used to their money . Or from Third Avenue , maybe . There 's always been tenements there . " She looked at Mrs. Hazlitt with an obtuse patronage that reminded her of an old nurse who had first instructed her on the social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money , poverty , snobbery  --  with a firm illogic that had still seemed somehow in possession  --  far more firmly so than her own good-hearted parents  --  of the crude facts . " New to the city , are you , " she said , more kindly . " It takes a while . " This time they rode up together . " Now you remember , " Miss Finan said , on leaving . " You 've two locks on your door , one downstairs . Get a telephone put in by your bed . Snug as a bug in a rug you are then . Nothing to get at you but what 's there already . That 's what I always tell myself when I 'm wakeful . Nothing to get at you then but the Old Nick . " The door closed on her . Watching her go , Mrs. I-Iazlitt envied her the simplicity , even the spinsterhood that had barred her from imagination as it had from experience . Even the narrowing-inof age would have its compensations , tenderly constrictingthe horizon as it cramped the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's snugness , on her way by now to the triumphant phone call to Jennie . But that was sinful , to wish for that too soon , what 's more it was sentimental , in just the way she had vowed to avoid . Mrs. Hazlitt pushed the button for Down . Emerging from the building , she looked back at it from the corner , back at her day of contrived exits and entrances , abortive conversations . People were hurrying in and out now at a great rate . An invisible glass separated her from them ; she was no longer in the fold . Later that night , Mrs. Hazlitt , once more preparing for bed , peered down at the streets through the slats of the Venetian blind . Catching herself in the attitude of peering made her uneasy . Darkening the room behind her , she raised the blind . After dinner in one of the good French restaurants on Third Avenue and a Tati movie afterward  --  the French were such competent dispensers of gaiety  --  she could review her day more as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  do  --  that ? " And even here she was addressing a vis-a-vis ,  |p236so  deeply was the habit ingrained . But she could see her selfimposedproject now for what it was  --  only a hysterical seeking after conversation , the final breaking-point , like the old-fashioned " crisis " in pneumonia , of the long , low fever of loneliness unexpressed . Even the city , gazed at squarely , was really no anarchy , only a huge diffuseness that returned to the eye of the beholder , to the walker in its streets , even to the closed dream of its sleeper , his own mood , dark or light . Dozens of the solitary must be looking down at it with her , most of them with some modus vivendi , many of them booking themselves into life with the same painful intentness , the way the middle-aged sometimesset themselves to learning the tango . And a queer bookingyou gave yourself today , she told herself , the words lilting with Miss Finan 's Irish , this being the last exchange of speech she had had . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accents , always such a delight to Sam , as good as ever . Well . she had heard a scream , had discovered someone else who had heard it . And now to forget it as promised ; the day was done . Prowling the room a bit , she took up her robe , draped it over her shoulders , still more providently put it on . " Oh Millie , " she said , tossing the dark mirror a look of scorn as she passed it " you 're such a sensible woman . " Wear out Mrs. Berry 's carpet you will , Millie , she thought , twenty minutes later by the bedroom clock , but the accent , adulterated now by Sam 's , had escaped her . Had the scream had an accent ? The trouble was that the mind had its own dis cipline ; one could remember , even with a smile , the story of the man promised all the gold in the world if he could but go for two minutes not thinking of the word " hippopotamus . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile , but it too had escaped . " Hippopotamus , " she said , to her dark image . The knuckles of one hand rose , somnambulist , as she watched , and pressed against her teeth . She forced the hand , hers , down again . I will say it again , aloud , she thought , and while I an '  |p237saying  it I will be sure to say to myself that I am saying it aloud . She did so . " Hippopotamus . " For a long moment she remained there , staring into the mirror . Then she turned and snapped on every light in the room . Across from her , in another mirror , the full-length one , herselfregarded her . She went forward to it , to that image so irritatingly familiar , so constant as life changed it , so necessarily dear . Fair hair , if maintained too late in life , too brightly , always made the most sensible of women look foolish . There was hers , allowed to gray gently , disordered no more than was natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if strained . " Dear me , " she said to it . " All you need is somebody to talk to , get it out of your system . Somebody like yourself . " As if prodded , she turned and surveyed the room . Even in the glare of the lights , the naked black projected from the window , the room sent out to her , in half a dozen pleasant little touches , the same sense of its compatible owner that she had had from the beginning . There , flung down , was Mrs. Berry 's copy of The Eustace Diamonds , a book that she had always meant to read and had been delighted to find here , along with many others of its ilk and still others she herself owned . How many people knew good bisque and how cheaply it might still be collected , or could let it hobnob so amiably with grandmotherly bits of Tiffanyware , even with the chipped Quimper ashtrays that Mrs. Berry , like Mrs. Hazlitt at the time of her own marriage , must once have thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls , with the silly , strawberry-mouthedMarie Laurencin just above the Beerbohm , the presence of good faded colors , the absence of the new or fauve . On the night table were the scissors , placed , like everything in the house , where Mrs. Hazlitt would have had them , near them a relic that winked of her own childhood  --  and kept on , she would wager , for the same reason  --  a magnifying glass exactly like her father 's . Above them , the only floor lamp in the house ,  |p238least  offensive of its kind , towered above all the table ones , sign of a struggle between practicality and grace that she knew well , whose end she could applaud . Everywhere indeed there were the same signs of the struggles toward taste , the decline of taste into the prejudices of comfort , that went with a whole milieu and a generation  --  both hers . And over there was , even more personally , the second bed . Mrs. Hazlitt sat down on it . If it were moved , into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , how sympathetically this flat might be shared . Nonsense , sheer fantasy to go on like this , to fancy herself embarking on the pitiable twin-life of leftover women , much less with a stranger . But was a woman a stranger if you happened to know that on her twelfth birthday she had received a copy of Dr. Doolittle , inscribed to Helena Nelson from her loving father , if you knew the secret , packr ; it place in the linen closet where she stuffed the neglected mend ing , of another , in a kitchen drawer , full of broken Mexican terrines and clipped recipes as shamefully grimy as your own cherished ones , if you knew that on 2/11/58 and on 7/25/57 a Dr. Burke had prescribed what looked to be sulfa pills , never used , that must have cured her at the point of purchase , as had embarrassingly happened time and again to yourself ? If , in short , you knew almost every endearing thing about her , except her face ? Mrs. Hazlitt , blinking in the excessive light , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ album , tumbled once . by accident from its shunted place in the bookshelf , and at once honorably replaced . She had seen enough to know that the snapshots , not pasted in separately , would have to be cx humed , one by one , from their packets . No , she told herself . she already knew more than enough of Mrs. Berry from all that had been so trustfully exposed here  --  enough to know that this was the sort of prying to which Mrs. Berry , like her . self , would never stoop . Somehow this clinched it  --  theirp239understanding . She could see them exchanging notes at some future meeting , Mrs. Berry saying , " Why , do you know  --  one night , when I was in London  --  "  --  herself , the vis-a-vis , nodcling , their perfect rapprochement . Then what would be wrong in using , when so handily provided , so graciously awaiting her , such a comforting vis-a-vis , now ? Mrs. Hazlitt found herself standing , the room 's glare pressing on her as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she reminded herself irritably , it were not self-imposed . She forced herself to make a circuit of the room , turning out each lamp with the crisp , no-nonsense flick of the wrist that nurses employed . At the one lamp still burning she hesitated , reluctant to cross over that last shadow-line . Then , with a shrug , she turned it out and sat clown in the darkness , in one of the two opposing boudoir chairs . For long minutes she sat there . Once or twice she trembled on the verge of speech , covered it with a swallow . The conventions that guarded the mind in its strict relationship with the tongue were the hardest to flaunt . But this was the century of talk , of the long talk , in which all were healthily urged to confide . Even the children were encouraged toward , praised for , the imaginary companion . Why should the grown person , who for circumstance beyond his control had no other , be denied ? As she watched the window , the light in the small gray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way disappeared . Without looking at the luminous dial of the clock , she could feel the silence aging , ripening . At last she bent forward to the opposite chair . " Helena ? " she said . Her voice , clear-cut , surprised her . There was nothing so strange about it . The walls remained walls . No one could hear her , or cared to , and now , tucking her feet up , she could remember how cozy this could be , with someone opposite . " Helena , " she said . " Wait till I tell you what happened while you were away . "  |p240She  told her everything . At first she stumbled , went back , as if she were rehearsing in front of a mirror . Several times she froze , unsure whether a sentence had been spoken aloud entirely , or had begun , or terminated , unspoken , in the mind . But as she went on , this wavering borderline seemed only to resemblethe clued conversation , meshed with silences , between two people who knew each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was almost at ease , settling back into the comfortably shared midnight post-mortem that always restoredbalance to the world  --  so nearly could she imagine the face , not unlike her own , in the chair opposite , smiling ruefully at her over the boy and his gingerbread fears , wondering mischievouslywith her as to in which of the shapes of temptation the Old Nick visited Miss Finan . " That girl and her log ! " said Mrs. Hazlitt . " You know how , when they 're that young , you want to smash in the smugness . And yet , when you think of all they 've got to go through , you feel so maternal . Even if  --  " Even if , came the nod , imperceptibly  --  you 've never had children , like us . For a while they were silent . " Warwick ! " said Mrs. Hazlitt then . " Years ago there was an actor  --  Robert Warwick . I was in love with him  --  at about the age of eight . " Then she smiled , bridling slightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know her age . " Oh , all right then  --  twelve . But what is it , do you suppose , always makes old actors look seedy , even when they 're not ? Daylight maybe . Or all the pretenses . " She ruminated . " Why . . . do you know , " she said slowly , " I think I 've got it . The way he looked in my face when I was speaking , and the way the dog turned back and he did n't . He was lip-reading . Why , the poor old boy is deaf ! " She settled back , dropping her slippers one by one to the floor . " Of course , that 's it . And he would n't want to admit that he could n't have heard it . Probably does n't dare wear an aid . Poor old boy , pretty dreary for him if he is an actor , and I 'll bet he is . " Shep241sighed , a luxury permitted now . " All , well . Frail reed  --  Miss Finan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her . " And on you . A police siren sounded , muffled less and less by distance , approaching . She was at the window in time to see the car 's red dome light streak by as it always did , its alarum dying behind it . Nothing else was on the road . " And there were the taxis , " she said , looking down . " I do n't know why I keep forgetting them . Veering to the side like that , one right after the other , and one had his light out , so it was n't for a fare . Nothing on the curb either . Then they both shot away , almost as if they 'd caught sight of something up here . And wanted no part of it  --  the way people do in this town . Wish you could 've seen them  --  it was eerie . " There was no response from behind her . She sat down again . Yes , there was a response , for the first time faintly contrary . " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ siren . I was up in aflash . I 'd have seen it . " She found herself clenching the arms of the chair . " Besides , " she said , in a quieter voice , " do n't you remember ? I heard it twice . " There was no answer . Glancing sideways , she saw the string of lights opposite , not quite of last night 's pattern . But the silence was the same , opened to its perfect hour like a century plant , multiple-rooted , that came of age every night . The silence was in full bloom , and it had its own sound . Hark hark , no dogs do bark . And there is nobody in the chair . Never was , never had been . It was sad to be up at this hour and sane . For now is the hour , now is the hour when all good men are asleep . Her hand smoothed the rim of the wastebasket , about the height from the floor of a dog 's collar . Get one tomorrow . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaking ? She made herself stretch out on the bed , close her eyes . " Sam , " she said at last , as she had sworn never to do in thoughtp242or word , " I 'm lonely . " Listening vainly , she thought how wise her resolve had been . Too late , now she had tested his loss to the full , knew him for the void he was  --  far more of a one than Mrs. Berry , who , though unknown , was still somewhere . By using the name of love , when she had been ready to settle for anybody , she had sent him into the void forever . Opening her eyes , adjusted now to the sourceless city light that never ceased trickling on ceiling , lancing from mirrors , she turned her head right to left , left to right on the pillow , in a gesture to the one auditor who remained . " No , " she said , in the dry voice of correction . " I 'm not lonely . I 'm alone . " Almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head cocked . No , she had heard nothing from outside . But in her mind 's ear she could hear the sound of the word she had just spoken , its final syllable twanging like a tuning fork , infinitely receding to octaves above itself , infinitely returning . In what seemed scarcely a stride , she was in the next room , at the French window , brought there by that thin , directional vibrationwhich not necessarily even the blind would hear . For she had recognized it . She had identified the accent of the scream . The long window frame , its swollen wood shoved tight by her the night before , at first would not budge ; then , as she put both hands on the hasp and braced her knees , it gave slowly , grindinginward , the heavy man-high bolt thumping down . Both sounds , too , fell into their proper places . That 's what I heard before , she thought , the noise of a window opening or closing , exactly like mine . Two lines of them , down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But that was of no importancenow . Stepping up on the lintel , she spread the casementswide . Yes , there was the bridge , one small arc of it , sheering off into the mist , beautiful against the night , as all bridges were . Now that she was outside , past all barriers , she could hear ,  |p243with  her ordinary ear , faint nickings that marred the silence , but these were only the surface scratches on a record that still revolved one low , continuous tone . No dogs do bark . That was the key to it , that her own hand , smoothing a remembered dogcollar , had been trying to give her . There were certain dogwhistles , to be bought anywhere  --  one had hung , with the unused leash , on a hook near a door in the country  --  which blew a summons so high above the human range that only $ dog could hear it . What had summoned her last night would have been that much higher , audible only to those tuned in by necessity  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the fold . Alone-oh . Alone-oh . That would have been the shape of it , of silence expelled from the mouth in one long relieving note , cool , irrepressible , the second one clapped short by the hand . No dog would have heard it . No animal but one was ever that alone . She stepped out onto the fire escape . There must be legions of them , of us , she thought , in the dim alleyways , the high , flashingterraces  --  each one of them come to the end of his bookings , circling his small platform in space . And who would hear such a person ? Not the log-girls , not for years and years . None of any age who , body to body , bed to bed , either in love or in the mutual pluck-pluck of hate  --  like the little girl and her mother  --  were still nested down . Reginald Warwick , stoppered in his special quiet , might hear it , turn to his Coco for confirmation which did not come , and persuade himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lying awake snug as a bug , listening for that Old Nick , death , would hear the thin , sororal signal and not know what they had heard . But an endless assemblageof others all over the city would be waiting for it  --  all those sitting in the dark void of the one lamp quenched , the one syllable spoken  --  who would start up , some from sleep , to their windows . . . or were already there . A car passed below . Instinctively , she flattened against thep244casement , but the car traveled on . Last night someone , man or woman , would have been standing in one of the line of niches above and beneath hers  --  perhaps even a woman in a blue robe like her own . But literal distance or person would not matter ; in that audience all would be the same . Looking up , she could see the tired , heated lavender of the mid-town sky , behind which lay that real imperial into which some men were already hurling their exquisitely signaling spheres . But this sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highcr than any of those . She brought her fist to her mouth , in savage pride at having heard it , at belonging to a race some of whom could never adapt to any range less than that . Some of us , she thought , are still responsible . Stepping forward , she leaned on the iron railing . At that moment , another car , traveling slowly by , hesitated opposite , its red dome light blinking . Mrs. Hazlitt stood very still . She watched until the police car went on again , inching ahead slowly , as if somebody inside were looking back . The two men inside there would never understand what she was waiting for . Hand clapped to her mouth , she herself had just understood . She was waiting for it  --  for its company . She was waiting for a second chance  --  to answer it . She was waiting for the scream to come again.  |p245WHEN  Dr. Bhatta , the Hindu " neurologist , " acquired the old Kuypers estate , which no one else would buy , and installed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a number of indeterminately transient guests , and a faintly rotten , saffron breeze of curry , the neighborsin the other old houses strung along the riverbank absorbed his advent with little more than mild comment . The river road , though deceptively near the city , was part boundary line of a county that brushed shadowy patroon-descended towns to the north , still sheltered , in its gentle ranges toward the west , tribal remnants with tattered Indian red in their cheeks , and had weathered many eccentrics in its time . Something about the county 's topography of rear-guard hills , pooled with legend and only circularly accessible , of enormous level-land sunsets brought up short by palisades that dropped the river road below into darkness at four , had long since made it a natural pocket for queer birds , birds of privacy . Many of these were still there , appearing at yearly tax meetings as vestigially alive as the copperheads that sometimes forked before the nurserymen 's neat spades in the spring . It was a landscape from which individualitystill rose like smoke , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the houses along the river road had had a special history , of the tarnished kind that often clings longer than honest coats of arms . Houses of wood , white , with endless verandas and gabled bedrooms framed in carpenter 's lace , they had been built by the dubiously theatrical or sportingp248rich of seventy or eighty years ago , whose habit had been to leave their trotting races on the Harlem of an afternoon , and to come , with a change of carriage , up the river , there to pursue , in champagne and blood and scandal , their unclosetcd amours . And the capricious summer palaces they had had the native workmen build for them , though sturdy of timber , still showed , even in a new age , the shaky regality of seasonal money . From turrets made without ingress , balconies soared and died away . Iron weathervanes swung unheeded over " widow 's walks " on which no rightful widow had ever paced , and at the ends of the grounds there was often a tiny pavilion , lodged like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was such a house that Dr. Bhatta had bought , acquiring it with some sleight of hand whereby the accompanying gunpowderpops of bill-collectors from the other places where he had lived were delayed for several weeks . When these too came , the neighbors were not surprised . Houses like the Kuypersestate had been harmonious even in decline . Descended through relatives who had not been deeded the income to keep them up , they seemed destined to be lost again by owners whose need of grandeur exceeded their incomes , often by those who needed grandeur in order to acquire income . Fakirs , healers , dealers in correspondence course faith  --  the river road had seen them come and go  --  all of them sharers in the circuitous faith that if one lived in a castle one could more easily attract devotees from whom one might then borrow money to pay for the milk . Idly the road decided that Bhatta 's title of " doctor " was more than probably self-assumed , but this did not really matter . Charlatans , if one made it quickly clear that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very tractable neighbors . They could not afford to be like old Mrs. Patton , who had half a million but never painted her house , and let her lawn grow as high as her hedge . Theyp249painted quickly , lavishly , at least in all the spots that showed , and kept their sites trim for trade . Not much was seen of the doctor that winter . It was an open winter , a mild one , but the doctor 's tall , corpulent form only showed itself occasionally , on the broad steps underneath his porte-cochere , calling to his dog , Lili , or shuffling in his carpet slippers as far as the greened bronzed griffins that guarded the gate , where he always turned to look critically at the house , his long maroon overcoat flapping at his ankles , the sun running like brown butter on his dark jowls and on the bald pate with its muttonchop of black hair . Occasionally he was seen , still in the coat and slippers , in front of the chainstorein the village , waiting while his two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have been said that he looked , at times , disconsolately cold , but to John Garner , his immediate neighbor on the road , and to others who established a greeting basis with him , the doctor 's comments on the world were always showily serene . Either he was a man of inner peace , or else his trade constrained him to appear so . Whatever his trade was  --  and this had not been quite established , it was of too large a dignity to allow him to help " the ladies , " as he always called them , load the car . These , Miss I.eeby and Miss Daria , were both blond , both small , both of uncertain age , but life had faded them in different ways . Miss Leeby 's hair and accent had a New England thinness and respectability , her pale eyes and stubby , broken-nailed hands the absent look of a worker uncomfortably away from her task . It was she who was seen from dawn to dusk on the grounds , grubbing and cutting , on the roof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away on the cupola of the house itself . When encountered , she had the stifled voice , the ducking ways , of a tweeny . Conversely , if , as rumored , the ladies were not the doctor 's secretaries but his consorts , then it was Miss Daria who gave herself the airs of the boss-wife . Her streakedp250hair fell to her shoulders in cinematic curls , her eyes were sunk in sockets blackened with experience , or kohl , or occasionally , as gossip had it , the doctor 's fist . Under her haggard fur coat she wore blouses of no illusion , through which one saw the bright satin points of her brassieres . It was she who drove the car , since the doctor did not work with his hands , and managedthe finances , since the doctor never handled money  --  some stores had already begun to complain that they had not yet handled any of his . But , as regarded the two women , he made no other distinction that anyone could see . When the dusty old car had been loaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his stance against the wall , seated himself in the front seat between the two ladies , gave a portly nod , and was driven away . But , with the earliest March thaw , activity burst its pod at the doctor 's , in advance of any place else . Armies of crocuses snapped to attention on the vast lawn , burlap was unwrapped to display dozens of rosebushes that must have been planted the fall before and were already beginning to twine properly up the chipped columns of the veranda , and all over the grounds there were peeping green evidences that Miss Leebv had indeed grubbed well . A truck came and groaned up and down the horseshoe driveway all one afternoon , depositing a sparkling white carpet of crushed stone . After it came the two women , raking it smooth , bordering it with two lines of whitewashedrocks that they lugged from the barn . When the mailman'struck stopped at the gate , Miss Daria called to him , and with his dazed help a large , ugly cement urn was eased up the cellar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When he left , with her nonchalant thanks , he looked angrily over his shoulder , and slammed hard the door of his truck , before he drove away . For , all that time , with eyes squinting happily in the tawny air , with powerful arms and chest revealedp251by the short sleeves and Byronic collar of his shirt , the doctor had been sitting on the stoop . It was only during the next few days , however , that John Garner , his neighbor to the north , began to take any consistent notice of what was going on next door . Garner was no gossip ; in the city during the business day he was conversely rather proud of the lazy , non-suburban tolerance of the road on which he lived , but a man who owns property , or nearly , has a natural vested interest in that of his neighbor . Ten years before , he and his wife Amelia had been " that nice young university couple " whom the cautious local bank had entrusted with a surprisingly large mortgage on the big old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the Garners , " with four children , two in school , and during all that time both the house and the mortgage had remained a little too big for them . Garner 's father had been a trial lawyer who had enjoyed to the full the strutting side of the law ; Gamer had passed for the bar , married , and been in practice as a modestly salaried subordinate of a small firm for some years before he had finally admitted to himself that there was no side of the law that he would ever enjoy , and that he would never be anything more at it than a respectable drone . Each work day , carrying the briefcase that had been given him when he passed the bar , he took the seven-thirty bus to the city , a tall man with thinning sandy hair , with cheeks whose tired creases quirked pleasantly when he smiled , and each evening , at half past six , he returned , a little thinner on top , a little more creased than he had seemed the day before . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magnificently tilled lands above the Finger Lakes , and when Gamer , in his private shuffiings of the past , thought of what might have been , he always returned to the same boyhood image of himself and the old man , his palm in the old man 's fist , and the two of them standing to watch whatever might be going on at the moment on the farm . In thep252evenings , the old man would sit at his roll-top desk in his catalogue-lined study , poring over his accounts , and it was the image of this too that Garner had retained , even more than the memory of the plump barns , and the tractor grooving the hills . It was a feeling of not " going to work , " as his father had done , but of working where you lived , where you stood , and of standing on the land . But his father had made the break to the city all too well ; the son , gentled to pavements and collars , listening to the valedictorian tell him that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been as incredulousas the father at the idea that the grandfather 's life might have been one such choice . Only , some five years later , during that same year when he had come to terms with his private assessment of himself , he had bought the property adjoining the Kuypers estate . Both properties fronted on the river ( although the Kuypers place had a seven hundred footage to his two ) , and the acreages of both places ran back in a straight line up and over the hill that rose sharply behind , and were lost in the woodland at the crest . Amelia , his wife , always assumed that they had made the move for the children 's sake , and because here , just barely within commuting distance of the city , their bit of money had stretched to so much more than it could have done in a newer , neater suburb . Over the years , Garner had come to believe this himself . But certain references in the deed , surveyor 's jargon that granted him a portion of ground under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ceded him certain calculable powers over the river , also gave him an immeasurable delight . It was , obscurely , because of this that , although he left all other civic duties to Amelia , he had allowed himself to be voted in as a member of the road 's zoning board , which met three times a year to ratify building permits , to consider and defer the pro ) lem of repaving the road , and to reaffirm its one holy gesture against the cellularly creeping city to the south  --  that no cow/merce , no multiple dwelling of any kind was ever to be allowed . He had long since forgotten that his own house , stolid relic of a history too colorless to survive , had once reminded him of his grandfather 's place , and that when , on fine Sundays , he walked up the back acre to his part of the hilltop and looked down over the cascaded tips of the pines that still grew here , the great blue stare of the river , deceptively motionless and foreshortened by other hills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an indifferent gardener ; he had never learned to pull salvation , like a turnip , from the soil . But each evening , when he crawled back from the multiple of multiples , there was a moment when he rested the briefcase on the porch steps , and plowed the river with his eves . It was at such a moment , at dusk on a Friday evening , when , turning from the river to note that his lawn should receive its first mowing in the morning , he saw that , over at the doctor 's , they had boarded up the little hexagonal summerhouse that perched halfway up the hill . The tiny peaked roof fitted like a dropped handkerchief over the columns that formed the sides ; it had been a simple job to fit long wooden shutters , of which most of the houses along the road had an abandoned stock in the cellar , in the airy spaces beneath . Between two trees , in a small clearing hacked out for it , above the ground-honeysuckle that matted the entire hill , it glimmered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for what purpose would they have done this now , in the spring , and as he did so , a figure came from behind the pavilion and started slowly along the skinny footpath that zigzagged down the hill . It was a woman , carrying honeysucklecuttings , two big sheaves of them that lifted her arms at right angles and trailed behind her , dragging the ground like a train . She passed him , quite close on the other side of the hedge , coarsely cut gray hair , emaciated eyes in a face he had never seen before , and trailed on through the opening in thep254hedge , down to the riverbank , where she let the cuttings fall into the river , and stood while they were borne away . She wheeled , and came back up the path . Even as he nodded , tentatively , into the uninflected face , he saw , with an inner , breaking " Ah ! " of pity , that she must be mad . The eyes told him first  --  set motionless , aghast , as in those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full eye set staring in the profiled nose . But it was the arms that told him for certain , arms still extended , cross-like , above the empty shape of the honeysuckle , as she marched back up the hill . She made three trips through the darkening air , each trip preceded by the sound of her scythe up above . When Garner finally entered his house , she had stopped coming , but he could still hear the slashing of the scythe among the vines . He said nothing to Amelia , eating in the kitchen with her and the four chattering children , grateful for the familiar , perky pottery dishes , for the room 's bright chromium sanity . But that night , as they were undressing for bed , in their room that faced the hill , he told her , and they discussed it in low , troubled voices . " It 's about the children that I 'm . . . " said Amelia . She turned out the light , as she always did before she put on her nightgown , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Look ! " she said , leaning on the window sill . The shutters that had been used to board up the summerhouse , Garner remembered , had been of the kind with a small half-moon cut out of the wood , and now , in each of them that made up the blank facade , there was a weak spot of light . The next morning , he was leaning on his new power mower ( almost paid for now ) , and looking at his shaved lawn with a warm sense of satisfaction , when the doctor emerged for his morning tour . To date , his and Garner 's over-the-hedge interchangeshad consisted mostly of Garner 's murmured assents to the doctor 's pronunciamentos on the beauties of what lay before them  --  Bhatta had a way of conversationally appropriatp255ing the glories of the universe , and pointing them out to his listener ( as if the latter might not have noticed them without his help ) that reminded Garner of some ministers he had known . Sometimes , at his approach , Garner , out of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get too thick " with neighbors , waved and moved on to a distant task , but today he stayed where he was . " Good morning , Misser Garner . " Bhatta advanced majestically . " I see you have been up early , and worked well . " He waved an expansive hand . " Now comes the beautiful time , har ? No fuel bills ! " Garner nodded , paying a moment 's silent tribute to the landscape , in accordance with the doctor 's gesture . " See you put in a fine lot of roses there . " " Yars . In my country , the cultivation is very simple . Plenty of manure , plenty of roses . But here there is only chicken manure  --  and very expensive . A commentary , har ? " Bhatta smiled broadly . Garner smiled also  --  an overcompensating smile of the kind one used with people who spoke a foreign language . He could never get over a feeling , of the worst provinciality , he knew , that Bhatta was not speaking English , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you closed up the summer-house . " " Yars . " The doctor took another turn at the landscape . " You , urn . . . you moving your practice up here ? " " I do not have what you would call a pract-ice , MisserGarner . " " Oh . . . I see . " " Um . " The doctor smiled again . " When I come to America to study medicine , I am very young , very enthusiastic . But when I finish , I find after all that I am not sufficiently  --  assimilated . For me , neurology is only part of a philosophy . I find I can not sit in an office and take mo-ney for making cures . A littlep256surgical , a little phar-maceutical housework  --  bang bang , one hundred dollars . " He shook his head . " Unfortunately , I am not happy doing housework , Misser Garner . " " But you do take some patients ? " " For a while I do many things . I give lectures , I write books , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people say , Bhatta , you have the secret of living , what is it ? ' I tell them that it is only because in India , where life is hard , we have to learn early the connection between work and love . I tell them that it is only here , where mo-ney churns butter , that people have time to suffer , because they do not have this connection . But they do not believe me . So I let them come up here and learn . " He turned to look at Miss Leeby , who was standing on a ladder some yards away , clipping a hedge . " When they arc grateful , they give gifts . For them it is therapy to give , and therefore it is possible for me to receive . " he turned back to Garner . " You understand how this is , Misser Garner ? " Garner had no immediate answer , but he saw , from the doctor 's expression , that a prompt one would have been a disappointment . " Ah , you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He turned away from Garner again , looking downriver with a benignant smile . " The air is so clear in America , " he said softly . " So very , very clear . " He beckoned suddenly toward Miss Leeby , who started obediently down her ladder . " Come and see Misser Garner 's beautiful new lawnmower , " he called . " How that woman works ! " he said , sotto voce . " How she loves flowers ! " Miss Leeby came and squatted down over the lawnmower , her work-split nails moving expertly over it , her bun and prim , altar-guild face odd over her man 's shirt , dungarees , and dirty saddle-shoes . " Is this not a beautiful machine , Leeby ? " said the doctor . " We ought to have one like it . " She looked up at himp257devoutly . " It would give me so much more time for the roses . " " Well , perhaps Misser Garner will show you how to run it , one day . " Garner nodded , half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his giving them the mower . Meanwhile , Miss Leeby had wandered over to Garner 's peony bed , and was kneeling there . " Why , you 're letting these choke ! " she said , horror sharpening her high voice . " If you do n't thin them , the ants will be all over the buds ! " She stretched a compassionatehand toward them , she had already taken a trowel out of a pocket , she was already beginning on them . " Now Leeby , " said the doctor , shaking his head indulgently . " Cultivate our own garden , please . " He watched her move back to her ladder , chuckles shaking his shoulders , his considerablebelly . " A happy woman , Misser Garner . When she first came to me , she was stone-deaf . Only a case of psychologicaldeafness , as her hundred-dollar man took care to tell me . Over on the doctor 's driveway , Miss Daria had backed out the old car , and leaving the motor running sluggishly , was stuffing a battered peach basket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with her black net stockings and very short skirt , with her long curls bobbing above the withered femme fatale make-up and the embarrassingly evident underwear , she looked like a grotesquely debased little girl , but she moved with stolid competence . The doctor squinted at her appreciatively , but made no revelations as to the history of her cure . " Ah , they need me for the shopping , " he said . Ile waved . " They keep me stepping , those ladies . This morning , a lobster , no less , for the curry . " He caressed his belt buckle . " How they love to spend mo-ney , those silly girls ! " With a salute to Garner , he started off , then paused . " You are a lawyer , eh , Misser Garner ? "  |p258Garner  nodded . By a fraction , he felt , he had prevented himself from adding " Yars . " " Ah , you must take curry with us some evening . I myself have a good many legal problems from time to time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doctor 's style of address had cast him . " Guess I 'm like you , Doctor , " he said , with a grin . " ' Fraid I do n't have my own practice either . " But it was the doctor who had the last word . " Ah , how lucky ! " he said . " How wise ! You too have learned , then , how destroying it is to admit the connection between mo-ney and the work one loves ! " Garner watched him cross his lawn and enter the car . The car moved stertorously down the driveway and slowly past Garner . Bland between his two ladies , the doctor saluted once more . Garner leaned on his mower for a minute , then started rolling it toward his garage . It was not until he had emerged , empty-handed , looking absently about him for the next Saturdaytask , that he realized that he had not learned anything more about the woman on the hill . That afternoon he went to the village to do the weekly shopping he and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preparations for the birthday party to be held for Sukey , their oldest , the next day . Ever since they had lived up here , a treasure hunt had been a traditional part of the children'sfetes ; in the dime store he gathered together a collection of prizes of that familiarity imposed by the ten-cent limit  --  crayons , bubble pipes , harmonicas , string bags of marbles and jacks , packets of green paper play-money with which the chi dren could play store in Sukey 's new cardboard grocery , some jointed plaster snakes , some rubber balls . At the last minute , groaning with lack of inspiration , he raised the limit to a quarter , and added some water pistols , and some pink plastic babies for the smaller girls . Then to the butcher 's , for the orderp259Amelia had phoned in , and at last to the supermarket , where he scarcely needed Amelia 's list . The order was always roughly the same , it seemed to him  --  enormous renewals on the breakfastfoods , the bread and the canned tomatoes ( Grade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and boxes of frozen vegetables ( these were no longer an economy except of time , Amelia had worriedly said last Saturday  --  now that they needed two of a kind for enough servings at a meal ) , the same list of staples , the two dozen eggs . Not pullets , he remembered , although this was not down on the list , for he had been a good pupil , and he knew now , among other bits of lore , that the cheaper pulletsworked out to no eventual good , because of their size . Poor Amelia , he thought , it was not her fault if her prideful instructionson the arts of domestic evasion had become repeti-tive  --  it was not her fault if the evasions had always to be the same . " Butter  --  or oleo , " the list said , leaving it up to him . Yes , perhaps it had better be an oleo week . He recalled the doctor 's phrase about money churning butter . A little dig at America . Where the living is easy , he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Garner chuckled . He was a sharp one , Dr. Bhatta , even if one could not quite tell whether his manner came from a lack of the language or a way with it . And a nervy one  --  to deliver that kind of sermon from a scat on the stoop . Garner had finished his list , pushed his overflowing wire basket to the end of the long queue at the cashier 's desk , and was idly betting with himself that his total would be somewhere between eighteen and nineteen dollars , when he saw , with a twinge , that he was directly behind Mr. and Mrs. Adrian Dee . The Dees were very thin , very old , and very poor  --  of a poverty that gentility held together like the black string tic that Mr. Dee wore to do his shopping , even in this weekend wilderness of sports shirts and dungarees . " Natives "  --  that is of the old Hudson Valley Dutch stock , as distinct from newcomers like Gamer himself  --  they were , as cousins , both of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose tenure had long since thinned with its blood . Mr. Dee had alwaysworked hard in one of those clerkly jobs the exact nature of which no one ever remembered , other than that it had been in some outmoded business which had finally faded just as its outmoded employees needed it most . They lived now in the smallest house on the river road , a kind of baroque toolhouse , its tipsy turret supported by a wisteria vine thicker than either of the Dees , that was located on the edge of what probably had once been all Dee land . Cornered in this last briar patch of inheritance , Mr. Dee , county historian and fiercest member of the zoning board , upheld the conscience , ancient and present , of the road . For if he loved the town deeply , with the love that one gives only to the place that best knows who one is , he had an even more subterranean fright of the city , with whose approach his delicately guarded identity would no longer be known at all . And the town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been delicate with him indeed . It was aware that he had refused to register for Social Security , and no one had ever dared sound him on the subject of old age pensions . Quietly the town saw to it that he had a place on those important committeesto which no suspicion of a fee could be attached ; even more quietly it had made his name the sole contender for those still honorable civic duties for which he could be paid . He was a keeper of records , a taker of censuses , a watcher at polls . At one crisis in Mrs. Dee 's health , the historical society had found itself in sudden need of a commissioned sesquicentennial report ; at another , the library had found itself similarly helpless without a part-time custodial appointee . But still , altogether , the fees must be very small . Once before , Garner had found himself in the aisle of canned goods , behind the Dees , and had averted his eyes , his ears , from the two pairs of hands , pale as thorns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twop261hatted heads bent in secret consultation over the price on the bottom of a tin . Now , above Garner 's bulging basket and the Dees ' sparsely tidy one , their glances met . " Mr. Garner sir , good morning ! " Mr. Dee offered his handshake , ghostly version of one that must once have matched the office with the fumed oak , the black leather davenport , the wine-dark cigars . Behind him , Mrs. Dee , gloved hands clasped , nodded only ; she belonged , by both personalityand era , to those women who enhanced their husbands ' dignity by echoing their actions but never equaling them . " Well met , sir , " said Mr. Dee . " On the part of the zoning committee , I was just about to get to you on the telephone . " Eighty , if he 's a day , thought Garner . Not the man for the latter-day " Ring you , " " Call you . " Or , more probably , no phone of his own . Mr. Dee leaned forward . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activities ? " he whispered . " Well . . . an unusual menage , I gather . " " Oh , that ! " Mr. Dee smiled primly , raising a milk-blue finger . " Not our concern , of course . We are not that kind of meddler here . But of late years  --  I have had to acquire the habit of reading the Times ' real-estate section . Unfortunately , local transactions have grown beyond the local newspaper . " Ile coughed , remembering gently that Garner , a former city man , must have had a history of just such a transaction , and fumblingin the watch-pocket of his vest , held out a clipping . Garner bent over it . Under the heading COUNTRY BOARD , he read : Come to the house of the Pundit Bhatta . Great white house like castle . Crushed stone driveway . Roses everywhere you look . Build your own guest-house . Indian cookery and wisdom . Health through peaceable work . Contribution , $30 per week . " I thought you and I might talk to the gentleman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him that the tradition , in fact the law ofp262the river road does not permit even two-family dwellings , much less any such communal development . " " From what I know of him , he 'll do the talking , " said Garner . He felt annoyed , suddenly and sharply , less by the threat to his own property  --  although the thought of other poor creatureslike the woman in the summerhouse , all sweeping the hillsidelike the seven maids with seven mops , was an unnerving one  --  than by the humiliated feeling that in this morning 's conversation with the doctor he had in some way been " sold , " been " had . " Some tricky sympathy in himself had responded to the kernel of what the man had said , had led him to conclude that if Bhatta sold nothing but confidence , he perhaps belonged , nevertheless , to that unique and complicated breed which believed in its own wares . He , Garner , had been " taken , " like those who listened to the talented swindler purely out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shares after all . " I doubt if we can force the boardinghouse issue , Mr. Dee , " he said . " The road never has , you know . Because of the occasionalhardship cases . " " But it 's not that ! " Mr. Dee pointed again to the ad , looking agitatedly around him , as if here , on this Rialto of screaming children , harried mothers , packhorse husbands , there were the very signs of the urban beast that waited , alert for the tip on a house that might be converted , a property that might be ac quired as a wedge , a sudden amalgamation that might be made . " Build . " he whispered . " You see what he says right here . Build ! " Back of Garner , the long line murmured , ahead of him the checker shrugged her impatience . " Oh I do beg all your pardons , " said Mr. Dee . With a " No , allow me , dear , " to his wife , who had once again moved a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ile took a five-dollar bill from hisp263wallet , and paid . " Perhaps I could walk down to see you tomorrow , sir , after church ? " Garner nodded , busy emptying his own basket . Then , as the Dees filed out , he called after them . " Care to wait , I 'll be glad to drop you and your things on the way . " " Oh , thank you , " said Mr. Dee , " but Mrs. Borden has already been so kind . " He raised his hat , including the checker in his nod , and went out , followed by a clerk carrying the small box of goods . Behind him , Mrs. Dee turned once , and smiled . Mrs. Borden , Garner thought . That would be the old Mrs. Borden , whose vintage car and chauffeur were often to be seen parked only in front of those grocers who still sold over the counter . After he had lived in the county for a while , he had gradually become aware of some of the old , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of things , he would never become acquainted with Mrs. Borden , or want to , there was somehow , because he did live here , a more than antiquarian or social interest in the knowledge that she had been a Van Schaick , that the Van Schaicks had held on to their land . No doubt she took care of the Dees quite regularly , in many little ways . For , below the stratum of couples like Amelia and himself , there was still discernible , in the bedrock of that very village which they would someday overwhelm , a faint vein of that other antique world of allegiance , still banding together against the irresistible now , still , in resentment or noblesse , taking care of its own . That night , after the children were asleep , he and Amelia walked up the back hill , lie swinging a lantern along the path , she carrying a basket of the toys for the treasure-hunt , which she had placed in the printed cotton bags they kept from year to year . Above them , the wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of maple seedlings , dogwood , fern , by an ominous spreading of bush and brush whose names he did not even know . Thirty years ago , in the feudal time of gardenersp264and servants , the hillside had been worked and terraced , a carefullyhusbanded sampler of grape arbors and cold frames , of neatly curtailed dells . But now , in this suburban renaissance where people bought for the sake of the houses and the land was only extra and ignored , almost all the places along the road backed up against a dark encroachment like this one , where , here and there in the spring , an occasional old planting sparked with stunted fruit , or a sentinel iris pushed its spear through the honeysuckle , the sumac and the grass . Just back of the house there was a large plateau where the garden officially ended , and it was here , in scuffed , already traditional places  --  in the hollow tree that held the swing , in the ledges behind the children 's tent , in the dry channels of last year 's squash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not too well hidden , where the children might find them the next day . They looked lovely in the starlight , with their dim paisley scrolls and freckles  --  like the fey nesting of some wild and improbable bird . He swung the lantern in an arc above them  --  an efficient department store lantern , bought for those evening hours when he cadged a bit of time to chop wood , to fix the fan-belt on the pump . Silly or not , with its fake oillanternshape , it felt good to swing it in this ritual that their years here had already built for them , above these places which for the children were long since familiar and old . Back at the kitchen door , Amelia stumbled in ahead of him , murmuring that the children had worn her to a frazzle , in and out of the house all day . He doused the lantern , and sat down on the porch steps , looking out at his acre , his back hill . At times it made him feel like an interloper , a defaulter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wilderness , but like a domesticanimal , crying to be tended . This year he would have to burn back the brush , for sure . Sometime before morning , he got up from bed to latch back a banging shutter . For a moment he thought he saw a **30;3618;TOOLONG from trees to watch him mount his wife . And Stem had begun to play " Billy One-Foot " again , a game in which he pretended his leg was a diabolical criminal . " I 'll get that old Billy One-Foot this time , " his son Donald would say , flinging his sucking blanket to the wind and attacking Stem 's heavy leg . And Stern , whose leg for months had remained immobile , would lift and twirl it about once again , saying , " Oh no , you do n't . No one can ever hope to defeat the powerful Billy One-Foot . " It was as though a great eraser had swept across Stem 's mind , and he was ready to start fresh again , enjoying finally this strange house so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home-coming train on one of these new nights , Stern , a tall , round-shouldered man with pale , spreading hips , flew happily across the estate , the dogs howling him on , reached his house , and , kissing his fragrant , long-nosed wife deep in her neck , pulled off a panty thread that had been hanging from her shorts . He asked her if anything was new and she said she had taken their son Donald about a mile down the road to see the new boy she 'd heard about . When the children ran together , the boy 's father had stopped cutting his lawn , pushed her down , and picked up his child , saying , " No playing here for kikes . " " What do you mean he pushed you down ? " Stem asked . " He sort of pushed me . I ca n't remember . He shoved me and I fell in the gutter . " " Did he actually shove you ? " asked Stem . " I do n't know . I do n't remember . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean he saw you ? " " I was wearing a skirt . I was n't wearing anything un-derneath . " " And he saw you ? "  | " I think he probably did , " Stern 's wife said . " How long were you down there ? " " Just a minute . I do n't know . I do n't want to talk about it any more . What difference does it make ? " " I did n't know you went around not wearing anything . You did that at college , but I thought you stopped doing that . " Stem knew who the man was without asking more about him and was not surprised at what he had said . The first Saturday after they moved in , Stem had driven around the sparsely populated neighborhood , smiling out the window at people and getting a few nods in return . He had then come to this man , who was standing in the middle of the road . The man had taken a long time getting out of the way , and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head incredulously , put his hands on his hips , and , with his shirt flopping madly in the wind , looked wetly in at Stem . Stem had held the smile on his own face as he drove by , letting it get smaller and smaller and sitting very stiffly , as though he expected something to hit him on the back of the head . On one other occasion , Stem had driven by to check the man and had seen him standing on his lawn in a T-shirt , arms heavy and molded inside flapping sleeves , his head tilted once again . And then Stem had stopped driving past the man 's house and , through everything that happened afterward , had blacked the man out of his mind . Yet he had waited nonetheless for the day his wife would say this to him . There was half an hour of daylight remaining . Stem 's son flew to the top of a living-room bookcase and said , " Get me down from this blazing fire , " and Stem climbed after him , throwing imaginary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him down to administer artificial respira/tion . They saw Popeye together on television , Stern 's wife bringing them hamburgers while they watched the set . When he had eaten , Stern said he was going to see the man , and his wife for some reason said , " Be right back . " He did not take the car , wanting the walk so he could perhaps stop breathing hard . On the way over , he kept poking his fingers into his great belly , doing it harder and harder , making blotches in his white skin , to see if he could take body punches without losing his wind . He hit himself as hard as he could that way but decided that no matter how hard you did it to yourself , it was n't the same as someone else . As he hit himself , a small temple of sweetness formed in his middle ; he tried to press it aside , as though he could shove it along down to his legs , where it would be out of the way , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and immaculately landscaped , but with a type of shrub Stern felt was much too commercial . It might have been considered beautiful at one time . A child 's fire wagon stood outside . Stern walked past the house , near to the curb , and then walked on by it , stoppingfifty yards or so away in a small wooded glade and ducking down to do some push-ups . He got up to nine , cheated another two , and when he arose , the sweetness was still there . He saw that he had gotten something on his hand , either manure or heavily fertilized earth . He wiped it on his olive-drab summer suit pants and kept wiping it as he walked back to the man 's house again , past it , and on down the road to his own . His wife was scrubbing some badly laid tile on the floor of the den , pretending the deep crevasses did n't exist . She was a long-nosed woman of twenty-nine with flaring buttocks and great eyes that seemed always on the edge of tears . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he asked her . " Whether there was physical con-tact ? " " I do n't remember . Maybe he did n't . " " Because if there was physical contact , that 's one thing . If he just said something , well , a man can say something . I just wish you had something on under there . I did n't know you go around that way . Do n't do it any more . " " Did you see him ? " his wife asked . " No , " said Stern . " It does n't make any difference , " she said , continuing on the tile.  |p17IT  WAS a lovely house , seated in the middle of what once had been a pear orchard , and yet it had seemed way out on a limb , a giddy place to live , so far from the protection of Stern 's city . Mr. Iavone , the real-estate agent who had taken Stern and his wife to the house , said , " If you like this one , it 's going to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can raise and I 'll see what I can do . " Mr. Iavone was a grim , short-tempered man who had been showing them selections all day , and when they finally drove up to this one , Stern felt under obligation to buy some house , any house , since Mr. Iavone had spent so much time with them . Golden children began to spill out of it , and the one that caught Stern 's attention was a blinking woman-child with sunny face and plump body tumbling out of tight clothes . Stern , had his life depended on it , would not have been able to tell whether she was a woman or a child . Iavone , in an aside to Stern , told him that the girl-woman was the reason the Spensers were selling the house , that she had taken to doing uncontrol/lable things in cars with high-school boys , bringing shame to Mr. Spenser , her father , who was in data systems . The house had many rooms , a dizzying number to Stem , for whom the number of rooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wealth of people by the number of rooms in which they lived . He himself had been brought up in three in the city and fancied people who lived in four were so much more splendid than himself . But now he was considering a house with a wild and guilty number of rooms , enough to put a triumphant and emphatic end to his three-room status . Perhaps , Stem thought , one should do this more gradually . A three-room fellow should ease up to six , then eight , and , only at that point , up to the unlimited class . Perhaps when a threeroomermoved suddenly into an unlimited affair he would each day faint with delirium . While Stern examined the house , Mr. Iavone sat at the piano and played selections from Chopin , gracefully swaying back and forth on the stool , his fingers , which had seemed to be real-estate ones , now suddenly full of stubby culture . ( Later , Stem heard that Mr. Iavone always went to the piano for prospective buyers to show he did not drive a hard bargain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Spenser , a man with purple lips and stiff neck , who seemed to Stern as though he belonged to a company that offered many benefits , walked around the house with Stern , clearing his throat a lot and talking about escrow . Stem listened , with a dignified look on his face , but did not really hear Mr. Spenser . Escrow was something that other people knew about , like stocks and bonds . " I do n't want to hear about stocks , " Stern 's mother had once said . " It 's not for our kind . Not with the way your father makes a living . There 's blood on every dollar . " Stern was surep19now that if he stopped everything and took a fourteenyearcourse in escrow , he would still be unable to get the hang of it because it was n't for his kind . Still , he felt very dignified walking around a house with a data systems man and talking about escrow . Mrs. Spenser invited Stern and his wife and child into the kitchen and brought out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this house ? " Stern asked . " Yes , " said Mrs. Spenser , a skeletal woman Stern imaginedhad been worn down by her husband 's dignified but fetishistic lovemaking requests . " This is quite a house , " said Stern . The price was $27,000 . Someone had told Stern always to bid $5,000 under the asking price , and , adding on $1,000 to be nice , he said , " How about $23,000 ? " Mr. Spenser muttered something about expediting the escrow and then said OK . Stern 's heart sank . He had been willing to go to $25,000 , and his face got numb , and then he began to tingle the way he once had after taking a onepennysharpener from the five-and-ten and then waiting by the counter , unable to move , to get his Dutch Rubbing from the store owner . Getting the house as low as he had , he felt a great tenderness for Mr. Spenser ; he wanted to throw his arms around the stiff-necked man , who probably knew nothing of Broadway plays with Cyril @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just got two thousand dollars from you . How much could you get paid by your company , which probably gives you plenty of benefits but only meek Protestant salaries ? Do n't you know that just because a man says one price does n't mean that 's all he 'll pay ? You 've got to hold on to those two thousands , because even though you 're a churchgoer you 've got a glandular daughter who 'll always be doing things in cars and forcingyou to move to other neighborhoods , pretending you 're moving because of oil burners or escrow. "  |p20Mr  . Iavone left the piano and said to Stern , " I see we have nice people on both sides . Would you like to leave some kesh now ? " " I want someone to see the house , " said Stern . " But you 've already talked price , " said Mr. Iavone . He grabbed his coat and slammed the top of the piano . " You bring people out , you 're a gentleman with them , you spend the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding the bag . You think they 're nice people . . . . I closed three million dollars ' worth of homes last year . " " I 've always lived in apartments and I want someone I know to look it over . Then I 'll buy it , " said Stern , but Iavoneslammed shut the front door . Mr. Spenser cleared his throat , and Stern was certain that the next day he would tell the other data systems people in his company about the tall , soft man who had come out , talked price , and then left without buying , the first time this had ever happened in the history of American house-buying . " I think I 'm just going to take it without doing any inspecting , " said Stern . " Sometimes it 's better that way . " Mr. Spenser called back Iavone , who came in and said , " I knew there were nice people on both sides . If we can get the kesh settled , we 'll be on our way . " There was much handshaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the piano . The closing was held several weeks later in the office of Mr. Spenser 's attorney , a polite man whose barren officehad only one small file in it . Stern felt a wave of pity for this attorney whose entire law practice could be squeezed into that little file cabinet . He wanted to say to him , " Stop being so polite . Be more aggressive and you 'll have larger cabinets . " Stern 's own attorney was Saul Fleer , an immaculate man with clean fingers , who took out a little pad when he met Stern at the station and , writing ,  |p21said  , " The train was eighty-nine cents . I enter every penny right in here . " Stern and Fleer had cokes , Fleer paying for his own and then writing " $.05 " on the pad . At the closing , Mr. Spenser and his wife sat upright , close together , their arms locked as though they were about to defend a frontier home together . Their marriage was a serious one ; this was a serious , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sat upright , and faced things together . They blended in with their polite lawyer , and Stern had the feeling they paid him in jellies . Stern thought Fleer drove too hard a bargain and cringed down in his seat each time Fleer , pointing a clean finger at legal papers , shouted at the Spensers ' attorney , " You can get away with this out here . If I had you back in the city , you would n't try anything like this . " Stern wanted to tell Fleer not to yell at the man , that he had only a small file . On the matter of who should pay a certain fifty dollars , Fleer said , " I 'd like to see you try a trick like this in the city . " Iavone said , " You put a gun right to my head . I have three million dollars ' worth of closings a year , and this is the first time I 've ever had a gun put to my head . " He walked out of the room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still locked , rose grimly and followed him , as though their property had been erased by an Indian raid . Their attorney , smiling politely , walked out , too . Stern wanted to be with them on the side of politeness and marital arm-linking and not have an attorney who waved fingers at people and was from the city . " Do I have the house ? " he asked . " You saw what happened , " said Fleer , stuffing papers into a briefcase , his face colored with anger . " They 're strong out here . I 'd like to get them in the city . " Then Stern , because he did n't want Iavone to fall under hisp22yearly three million , because the polite lawyer 's tiny file touched him , and because he felt vaguely un-American , whispered , " I 'll pay the fifty . " Fleer said , " Aagh , " and threw up his hands in disgust . Stern went to the staircase and , in a cracked voice , hollered , " Mr. Iavone . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Stern " instead of " Mr. Stern . " At the end of the closing Mr. Spenser handed over the key , and Stern , who had always lived in the city , suddenly became frightened about being away from it . He wondered with a chill whether he really did want to live " out here . " Later that afternoon , he drove to the house with his wife and child and , as if to certify his possession of it in his own nonlegal way , Stern , in suit and tie , rolled from one end of the wide lawn to the other while his wife and child shrieked with joy . The boy had large eyes and a strange , flaring nose , and his looks changed ; in the bright sun he seemed pathetically ugly , but then , coming swiftly out of a sleep , or by lamplight , hearing stories , his face seemed tender and lovely . Stern , standing on the lawn now , made up a game right on the spot called " Up in the Sky " in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him first between his legs and then up in the sky as far as he would go . On the way down once , the boy said , " Throw me up high enough to see God . " " How does he know about God ? " Stern asked , a little chilled because he was n't sure yet what God things to tell the child and had n't counted on it coming up so early . " A little girl on Sapphire Street where we used to live , " said Stern 's wife . " God can beat up a gorilla , " said the little boy as Stern flung him skyward . Stern threw him up again and again , once with viciousness , as though he really did want top23lose him in the sky so that he would not have to figure out what to tell him about God . A stab got Stern in the bottom of his wide , soft back then and he dropped to his knees and said , " Everyone on the giraffe . " His wife and child got on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He went across the lawn carrying them , but there was a strained frivolity about the game . He wanted someone to see him , and when a car drove by , he smiled thinly , as if to say , " We 're homeowners . See how much fun we always have and how we fit in . " But when the one car had passed , there was no one left to show off for ; in the distance there was a bleak , lonely , deserted estate , where once a man named Bagby had each Sunday skidded through the snow in a horsedrawnsleigh , entertaining his grandchildren . Stern went inside his house and walked from room to room , giving each one a number and hollering it out aloud as he stood in the center of each . " I always wanted a lot of rooms , " he said , clasping his long-nosed , great-eyed wife to him . " Now look how many I 've got . " After moving in officially several days later , Stern hired a trio of Italian gardeners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cackling , slow-moving ones and a fragrant and temperamental young man who spoke no English but had worked on the gardens of Italian nobility . The old men made straight borders along their flower beds , but the young man did his in curlicues , standing off after each twirl and making indications of roundness in the air with his hands . Their price was three dollars an hour , and as they moved along Stern began to worry that they were n't working fast enough . He saw the shrub preparationcosting him $800 , leaving him no money for furniture . Stern wanted to tell the young man to stop doing thep24time-consuming curlicued borders and to do straight ones like the old men to keep the bill down . But he was afraid to say anything to a handsome young man who had worked on the grounds of Italian nobility . Stern watched the gardeners from inside the house , ducking behind a curtain so they would n't see him . He hoped they would hurry and perspired as the dollars ticked away in multiplesof three . The old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cackling obscenely at the handsome young man as he made his temperamental curlicues . Then Stern lost sight of the young man and imagined that his long-nosed , great-eyed wife had inhaled his fragrance and dragged him with a sudden frenzy into the garage , her fingers digging through his black and oily young Italian hair , loving it so much more than Stern 's thinning affair , which fell out now at the touch of a comb . But the young gardener was making tiny paths in the backyard rock garden , and when he and the two cacklers were paid and had left , Stern called his family together and said , " We 've got paths . I 'm a guy with paths . " Even though they were narrow and largely decorative , Stern insisted his wife and child walk in and out of the paths with him , the whole child and half his wife not really fitting and spilling over onto the grass . That night , Stern gathered his wife and son to him and they sat on the front steps of the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft legs , bare in Bermuda shorts . They watched it get dark , felt the air get dewy and unbalancing . " This is the best time , " he said , as though he had lived ten thousand nights in houses , analyzing all the various hours of the day for quality before settling upon this one as the best . The night made him feel less jittery and isolated . Whatever bad was out there wouldp25wait until the next day . He had his boy on his lap and his wife 's hips against him and he was sitting on stone steps . He might have been in the city with a thousand families all around him , ten minutes from his mother 's three rooms . As he sat on the stone , a fire truck screamed to a halt before his house and a man in a fireman 's uniform raced across his lawn to the steps . The man was small and had low hips with powerfully thick legs . Stern , walking through meat sections at supermarkets , had always wonderedwho bought the pork butts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never consider . It seemed to Stern that this man was probably someone who ate them , and , instead of making him undernourished , their gristle and waste went to his legs and perversely made him wiry and powerful . " We 're having a firemen 's ball , " the man said . " Do you want to go ? The twentieth of this month . " Stern smiled in what he thought was home-owning folksiness and said , " We ca n't make it that night . I 'm sorry . " The fireman wheeled on his trunklike legs and ran apishly back to the truck . " You were wrong , " his wife said . " Everyone buys tickets . Nobody really goes . You just give them the money . " Stern , in Bermudas , ran across the lawn , shouting , " I 'll take two after all , " but the truck had already screamed off , and Stern heard a voice yell " Shit " into the night . " My first thing in this town , " said Stern , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put his great , soft body on the stoop against his wife 's hips , not at all comforted by the night now , and imagined his house with all its rooms burning to the ground , his child 's hair aflame , while thick-legged firemen , deliberately sluggish , turned weak water jets on the roof , far short of the mark.  |p26The  Spensers had failed to tell Stern to spray the area , and , a month after he moved in , a caterpillar army came and attacked the grounds . When Stern first saw the insects , he said , " I 'm going to get them , " and went out to the lawn and began to flick them off the shrubs and then step on them when they were on the ground . But there were huge wet clumps of them on everything , and he called the spray company . " It 's too early to get after them , " the man said . " If you get at them too early , you just waste your spray . You 've got to wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waited a day and then called again ; anothervoice answered and told him , " It 's too late . You missed the right time . They 're in there solid now . " " The other man in your place said to wait , " Stern said . " I 'll rap you in the teeth you get smart , " the voice screamed . " I 'll come right over there and get you . You want to make trouble , I 'll give you trouble all right . " Stern bought some chemicals in a store and said to his wife , " I know there are billions , but I 'm going to get every one of them . This is our house . " He went to work on a beautiful mountain ash tree first . There was little of it showing ; the tree might as well have been one large wet caterpillar . Stern sprayed at it for an hour , until his hands were broken with blisters , but only a few caterpillars fell , not really from the potency of the chemical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were hardy when they touched the ground and Stern knew they would find their way back to the tree . He stopped spraying , and in a few days the caterpillars had left and Stern and his wife were able to see that they had attacked in a funny way , eating approximately half of everything , half of each bush and half of each shrub . In front of the house stood a wild cherry tree , lovely and fruitful on one side , black , gnarled , and cancerous on the other . The plants never went back to normal , and sincep27it was too massive a job to replace each one , Stern and his wife learned to approach them only from certain angles , ones from which they looked complete , and pretendthey were whole shrubs instead of half ones . Stern was sickened by the diseased shrubs ; it was not so much their appearance that troubled him but the feeling that he had betrayed a sacred trust . " The house has been standinghere for thirty years with whole shrubs , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a month and there are halves . " There was , too , the dog escort problem . The house was somewhat isolated from transportation conveniences , and to get to the railroad station each day ( where he left for his job in the city ) , Stern had to cross the huge , longdesertedestate old man Bagby had once skidded across in a sleigh . It was spread out over eighty acres and took Stern twenty-three minutes each way , much too long a walk to be brisk and refreshing . The train ride then would be an hour and six minutes , which meant that Stern would be traveling roughly three hours each day . When they had first considered the house , his wife had said , " Take the ride once . It may be too long . See how you like it . " But Stern had answered , " I do n't want to know about it . I love the house . If I take the ride , I may not like it and we 'll never live in this house . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about any rides . " The estate was a lonely , windless , funereal place , terriblyquiet , with many odd little buildings , and for the first weeks of walking its length Stern made it his business to investigate a different one of them each morning . On one such morning , he climbed the watchtower and stood on the second floor , looking out of the cracked windows onto huge , rolling lawns and at bushes that had holes in them , seemingly torn out at random by large fists . Stern wondered how the estate was when it wasp28new , and then he walked over to the main estate building . On an impulse , he poked his elbow through a weak door panel and looked around innocently in the clear morningas though he , too , was surprised at all the commotion . Able to open the lock now , he waited till the echo had quieted and went inside the estate building , sweating hard , and then climbed the winding steps to the second floor . Doing everything in a hurry , he stood first in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went out to the circular balcony , extended his arms , and hollered , " Throw them to the lions , " to imaginary throngs below . Then he decided to take something . The rooms seemed empty , except for a packet of newspapers tied with string . Stern worked a single paper loose and , tucking it under his arm , walked swiftly down the stairs . He smelled coffee burning and then ran out the door and kept running all the way to the train , running so hard he got a pain in his chest . He did not look at the dusty newspaper until he was in the coach . It was dated 1946 , and its recent vintage somehow spoiled the whole estate for him ; he never went into any of the buildings again . In any case , it was not the walk through the estate each morning that troubled him so much as the walk back at night . At the farthest corner of the estate area , near the train , stood a loosely scattered group of houses in a heavily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the estate and were still being lived in . In darkness each night , Stern had to cross this cluster of houses . There was no easily defined road in the area , and since it was not a real community , the only light was from an occasional window ; Stern had to walk through using a pocket flashlightand not really sure whether he was on someone 's property . On the second night of his estate-crossing , it was not quite so dark as it was to be later on , and Sternp29was able to see two thin , huge dogs vault a fence that encircled one of the houses and make for him with a whistling sound . They skimmed through the night and came to an abrupt halt at his feet , their gums drawn back , teeth white , both dogs reaching high above his waist . One took Stern 's wrist between his teeth , and the two animals , hugging close to his side , walked with him between them , as though they were guards taking a man to prison . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not really sure he could cry out . The houses were fairly far off ; it would take a loud cry to reach them , and Stern was certain only old people lived in them and would n't be able to make out voices in the night . He tried not to perspire , having heard you showed your fear that way , but he was n't able to tell whether he was or not since it was chilly . They walked a quarter of a mile with him that way , hugging him tight on both sides , until the dog releasedhis wrist , which was soaking wet ; then both turned and went back , trotting swiftly through the night . The next day , Stern bought a penknife in the station , but when the dogs vaulted the fence that evening , he was taken aback by their speed and the whistling sound . He rememberedhearing once as a child that you should never draw a blade unless you really meant to use it . Deciding the blade was probably too short , he succumbed meekly and allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't seem to be anything he could do . He had heard too that you could break a dog 's back with a swift judo chop on the spine , and he took his wrist out of the dog 's mouth and tapped it lightly on its leathery back , but the dog made a sound and he put his wrist back . He thought of walking up to the house from which the dogs came , but he was certain the animals were trained to kill all people who passed through the fence and would get him in the throat before he reached the door . The houses were in ap30vague sort of grouping , not in any definite town or area , and there did n't seem to be any way to get close enough to the dog-protected house to see its address . The following day , Stern tried to guess what the address might be and called a number on the phone . An old woman 's voice , hearing his , hollered , " Crumbie , crumbie , " and hung up . There did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor was Stern sure an ordinance was being violated . He was afraid of the police and did not want to call them anyway . He pictured the police in the sectionto be large , neutral-faced men with rimless glasses who would accuse him of being a newcomer making vague troublemaking charges . They would take him into a room and hit him in his large , white , soft stomach . So each night he continued to walk slowly through the estate , waiting for the dogs , almost a little relieved when they finally whistled to his side , never really sure they would n't decide one night to kill him in a muffled place where there would be no one to pull them off . He saw himself fighting silently in the night with the two gray dogs , lasting eight minutes and then being found a week later with open throat by small Negro children . Certain he would be killed , if not by the dogs then because his white , soft body did not seem capable of living past fifty , he called a broker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one to complain to . No one who could help Stern with that kind of problem . His only neighbor at the new house was an ancient man with a thin chest who was always being placed and arranged in different positions . He would be placed in the sun and then shifted to the shade when the heat got too intense for him . Then he would be moved inside and placed before the televisionset , great care being taken not to jostle him . In thep31wintertime he would be shifted to a train going to Virginia , where he owned a small farm . Stern later heard that once he touched down in the South , he would leap spryly out of his wheelchair and rarely be seen in daylightwithout two plump-chested young girls at his side . One bright day , the man sat vegetablelike in a folding chair , having recently been placed there by his wife . Stem , in a shining burst of weekend hope , had run out of doors with a two-pronged shovel and was loosening the earth around one of his half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through to it and make the cancerous side blossom and start to flourish . Across a low fence , he saw his thin-chested neighbor and told him about the dogs . " They wait for me each night , " he explained . With frail wrists , the man drew from his wallet a commissioner'sbadge and said , " I was very powerful when I had my health . I was able to get stop signs put up . Forget the dogs . I 'll take care of them . Do you want to get me around a little to the east . . . " Stern shifted his neighbor around , hardly able to suppress his joy ; he was thrilled to have commissioner-type power on his side and wanted to hug his neighbor 's thin chest with delight . Actually he was a little afraid of him now , convinced that as a onetime commissioner he had weapons nearby and probably knew judo holds , ones you could deliver despite a thinness at the wrists . Stem looked forward to swift action , but the dogs continued to slip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man had done nothing after all . To get any action out of him , Stem imagined his neighbor would have to be carried to the police station and placed before the chief . The man 's wife was of little help . A short woman who wore loose-flowing Alpine dirndls , she had a garbage problem and was always carrying a bagful out to a wire basket in front of her house to burn it . " I do n't knowp32where it all comes from , " she would say to Stern as she made her endless pilgrimage to the basket . Often , on her way back for another load , she would see Stern across the fence , working silently to bring life back into his halves , and say , " I can remember when your house was really beautiful . " Once she invited Stern and his wife into her own home . She took them into the kitchen and said , with arm extended , " This is my kitchen . " Then she took them into the living room and said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the house . She pointed to her husband , who had been placed in front of a fishbowl , and said , " This is my husband . " Then she bid them goodbye , saying , " There was a time when your house was so lovely . " She never asked them in again . Since the summer had been cruel to him , Stern looked forward to cold weather , when he would at least not have to bother with neighbors and to face the half shrubs each day . In the winter your shrubs were not supposed to be beautiful , and Stern watched with delight as the grass faded and the leaves dropped and his half shrubs fell in with the bleakness as though their black cancer shapes were the fault of the cold and not a caterpillar miscalculation . The snow came on fast that first winter . One night it built up to eight-inch drifts and was still dropping heavily when Stern , in low-cut Italian rubbers , left the train . The dogs did not clear the fence , hanging back instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  as though aware that the snow would make them clumsy , unable to terrorize Stern . He was halfway across the estate when the snow piled up knee-deep and stung its way into his eyes . He bent his great back , lowered his head , and shuffled into the wind ; when he had walked far enough to get to his house and still could see no lights , he knew that he had lost his way . A great pain pounded through his nose , and he could not feel his face or catchp33his breath . With no knowledge of the stars , he saw himselfmaking an endless circle in the snow and then falling silently asleep in a drift , to die of frostbite yards from his new home . The wind and snow flew at him with bitternessand his face seemed to belong to a stranger . He was unable to go further and stopped , defeated by the wind , not after a forty-day trek from Point Barrow , but twenty minutes from his commuter train . Feeling ridiculous , he sat down in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Get me ! " into the night . He napped that way for a moment , and when he awakened things were not too much better . He urinated in the snow , feelinggiddy and dangerous in this white place more private than a thousand bathrooms . When the wind hit him in his open fly , he imagined himself freezing up swiftly , breakingoff with a quick snap like winter wood , and he withdrewquickly with drops remaining . Then , pulling his collar together and making a serious face , he bent to the snow again , as though , by being very businesslike about it and pretending he knew exactly where he was going , the fates would somehow carry him to his door . Later , he came out of the estate , not opposite his house , but in a new part of town . He had to walk three steep hills to his house , but then , turning a corner , with everything wet upon him , he saw it suddenly , as though through a curtaindrawn open quickly . It was bathed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were cloaked with mounds of jeweled snow . It was an enchanted candy house , the loveliest in all the world , and Stern , standing wide-hipped and breathless as though beneath a spell , enjoyed what was to be his finest moment of the winter . Stern thought that in the cold weather he would turn his thoughts inside to family and home , creating a handsomeinterior that would make up for the cancer garden . He would then lead visitors swiftly through the mottledp34shrubs , entertain them in interior splendor , and rush them out under cover of darkness . The paint-store owner delivered gallons of paint one Saturday morning , and then , when Stern raised his brush to deliver the first dab , the owner hollered , " Do n't paint . " Stern lowered the brush and the man continued to shout : " Never paint . Lay your brushes aside and , for Christ 's sake , do n't paint . You paint and you 're a fool . Uh-uh . No painting , do n't paint , never paint . " And then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Until you 're ready to paint . " He then imposeda long list of conditions which would have to be met before it would be all right for Stern to paint . " Scrape your walls , scrape your floors , paper your halls , drape your dainty pieces , test your tones , check your temp , dress properly . But , for Christ 's sake , do n't paint . That is , until you 're ready to paint . " Stern and his wife set all the paint in the corner of the room and waited until the ideal day came along , but it never did , and they gradually lost interest in painting . It was decided they would get rolling by laying tile , and Stern 's father sent Crib , an ageless Negro with great strength in his wrists , to help them lay it , his services a moving-in gift . Stern 's father , a small , round-shouldered man who always wore slipovers , had worked most of his life in a shoulder pad concern for his brother , Uncle Henny , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Henny , a coronary patient , passed on . When Henny did expire , however , the business went instead to a distantnephew who had always worked in civil service positions , and Stern 's father had to continue in a subordinate position , his life more or less gone up in smoke . Crib , a sweeper and handyman , had supported Stern 's father for head of the business , almost as though it had been an election , and now , years later , remained a faithful supporterof his.  | " He a fair man , " Crib once said to Stern . " And nobody cut a pad like him . No waste . " And Stern 's dad , in turn , spoke with admiration of Crib 's great strength . " He must be about ninety , but he 's some strong guy . You ought to see what he can lift . " Crib appeared early one morning , wide nose parched with cold , slapping himself as though he had come all forty miles on foot , and Stern , who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a show of brotherhood . He raced upstairs to rouse his wife and bring her downstairs , long-nosed and cranky , so she could fix some bacon and eggs for the Negro . To make Crib feel at home , Stern howled with laughter as his father 's friend made such remarksas " It too cold for ole Crib out here . " When Crib had cleaned his plate of eggs , Stern asked if he wanted some milk to wash them down and Crib , with a wink , said , " That ai n't what I want . " Catching on , Stern filled up a tumbler with rye and Crib drained it , smacking his lips . " That what I want , " said Crib slyly , and Stern howled with laughter once again . " Now ole Crib fix you up , " said the Negro , rising and going to the tile . He rolled his sleeves back over his great wrists , and Stern felt that even though tremendous power would not be needed to lay the tiles , it was comforting to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his knees , measuring and arranging and muttering , " Ole Crib forgot his tile cutter . " Stern silently placed a variety of sandwichesand another tumblerful of rye on a loose tile near Crib , and in the evening , when the job was finished , Stern 's wife had a roast ready . Later , Crib went back to inspect his work , shaking his head and saying , " Crib wish he bring his tile cutter . " Stern gave him twenty-five dollars , hugged him tightly , and saw him off , thinking for a moment how wonderful it would be if he could have Crib out there with him , using his great wrists to fight Stern'sp36enemies , police in rimless glasses and short , powerfulleggedfiremen . " You made too much of a fuss over him , " said Stem 's wife , and Stern replied , " He 's a saint . We were lucky to get him . " A day later , the tiles buckled , andStern had to put books , A Treasury of the World 's GreatClassics , about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removed , great crevasses remained between the tiles and Stern 's wife said , " We really needed him . " " We got him for nothing , " said Stern . " It 's not a bad job . Nobody gets tile exactly right . " But the crevasses made them suddenly lose interest in fixing up the house . They left the paint cans in the corner of the living room . The floors remained bare of carpeting , the windows without drapes . They took to ducking down when passing open windows in the nude , to avoid being spotted by cars . Upstairs , in Stern 's bedroom , the color scheme remained Mr. Spenser 's winter-green selection , and inferior artwork whipped up by the golden Spenser children still hung about the walls . At this point , all of the sweetness seemed to drain out of Stern , a man who had once played a thousand inventive games with his son , Donald . There were no young children in the neighborhood for the boy to play with , and often , with the air clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the front stoop , stroking a blanket , shaking quietly and trying to rock himself to sleep at the height of day . " Why do you need a blanket ? " Stern would ask , and his son would answer , " I do n't know . " And Stem , in early morning , jittery and uncertain , an endless pilgrimagein front of him , would kneel at his wife 's bed and say , " For Christ 's sake , see that he has activities . " " What am I going to do out here ? " she would answer , and at night , when Stern had gotten past the dogs , he would find his son standing in the middle of the lawn ,  |p37holding  his blanket as though he had been there all day , waiting for Stern to come back . So Stern , his stomach bursting with guilt , had made up games . A favorite had been " Butterfly Hand , " in which Stem 's quiet , fat hand would suddenly begin to flutter and wiggle . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his son as it flew about the room . " There 'll be no controlling it now . " The hand would then go still and Stem would lift his son above his head , the boy 's arms extended , for a bout of " Airplane , " carrying him with droning sounds about the room and then bringing him in for tabletop landings in " San Diego . " Top game of all was " Billy One-Foot , " in which the boy would fight an all-out battle with Stem 's leg , " Billy One-Foot , the toughest of all fighters . " They had endless thumb fights , too , but now Stem could no longer muster spirit to play the games . He would sit cold and heavy in an empty room , and when the boy said , " Let 's play Billy One-Foot , " Stem would pat him on the head and say , " Billy One-Foot is sick now . " Occasionally , he would swing his boy round the room in a circle , clamping his own eyes shut in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boy headfirst against a stone wall , forever ending thoughts of God and blankets and other children . He had always found it amusing that his wife was lax about managing things . " You think you can get away with carelessness because your behind is beautiful , " he would say , and clasp her surging buttocks . But a banister was loose that winter in their bare and windy house . It fell into no special category of repair  --  neither carpentry nor stairway work  --  and when his wife was slow to have it attended to , Stern took to shocking her with vivid accountsof what would happen because of her inaction : " Your son will fall , and perhaps when you see him at thep38bottom of the stairs with his head open , you 'll realize the importance of having it fixed " or " A slight push on top and he 'll be at the bottom dead . " And Stern imagined such a scene , his son with cleaved skull and Stem unable to cry convincingly . Once , a childhood friend named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stern his dog 's leash to hold . Stern purposely let go the leash , and the dachshund ran a mile before it went beneath a speeding car . Ruggie then came back carrying the dog in a dumb march , the dachshund 's body staining his sleeves , to put him some place , while Stern watched , frozen to the ground . Now Stern imagined himself with his son 's smashed body in his arms , going dumbly outsideto put him someplace , too . He imagined a scene in which he was putting all the dead boy 's toys in a box but continually finding new ones as years rolled by . Stern 's wife , too , became sullen , mostly about having no friends . For a while , a distant cousin of Stern 's named Barbie visited and served as a companion to her . But she centered everything , the food in the middle of plates , flower vases in the center of tables . She even put Stern 's son in the exact center of the couch as he watched television . Stern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her constant teen-age questions . Though she was far out of her twenties , she would ask Stem 's wife , " Do you think it 's sinful to allow petting on a first date ? " and " Will I lose Phil if I do n't let him go as far as he wants ? " When she left , Stern 's wife had no one , and when he asked her about this , she said , " I do n't need anyone , " and this infuriated Stern . " You 've got to have friends , " he screamed at her , and then he had a picture of all three of them , his wife , his son , himself , sitting on the lawn , sucking blankets , shaking and trying to rock themselves to sleep.  |p39He  had met his wife at college after being rejected by a young girl with musical voice and tangles of blond hair who acted in Arthur Wing Pinero plays , doing deep , curtsyingwalk-ons that made Stem weak in his middle . He had scrupulously avoided taking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as " not the kind of girl you do that with " until , disgustedly , she refused to see him , telling him , " Someday you 'll understand . " A week later , he met his wife , a girl with great eyes and shining black hair and no music in her voice , and , after an anecdote or two to establish his charm , he went with her to a blackenedgolf course and , with clenched teeth and sourness , drove his fat hand through her summer-smelling petticoatsand , as she moaned " God no , " kissed her and tried not to think of curtsies . Later that first night , he went into her a little , and they both froze and clung to each other . Stern at that time boarded off campus with a trembling old ex-bass fiddle player who sat each night wearing trusslikeold-man belts and gadgets and twanged his instrument in the basement . The old man was not particularly nice to Stern . He feigned munificence by asking Stem to have glasses of milk but actually used him as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat in his bands and trusses , Stern would spirit the petticoated girl into his room , undressing her swiftly and then tasting and biting her , going at her with anger and closed eyes to drive away all traces of Victorian curtsies . She was the only daughter of a man who had missed great opportunities as a baseballexecutive and now lived with silver tongue and failingeyesight in an Oregon apartment . Her mother was Hungarian , had lost three children in infancy , and spent her time crocheting bitterly , dreaming of three dead sons . Lean of funds , they had sent the girl , with heavy trunkloadsof petticoats , for a single year of college and thenp40no more . She dated constantly , afternoons and evenings , an endless succession of boys . Stern asked her what she did on these dates and she said she 'd kissed most and allowedsome to " kiss her on top . " " You 're the only one from New York I 've known , and you 're different , " she said to him . " You care for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good dresser . " Psychology interested her , but she mispronounced words , and it bothered Stern , a man who waded without joy through classics , that she had never tried Turgenev . She had total recall of her childhood and , her voice filled with pain , she told Stern tales that failed to move him . " I had twelve birds , and each time I got to love one , my parents would get rid of it . I 'd come home and see it not there and look all over and then I 'd realize that they 'd given it away . They 'd just give me enough time to love it , and then it would get out of the cage and make on the floor and my father would say , It 's a filthy animal , ' and give it to a girl friend . " She was aware of her longnosedbeauty and would say to Stern , " You should have seen me at eight . I tapered off a little up through ten , but at eleven my face would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about my face at thirteen . I was really beautifulthen , really something . " She complained much of her childhood ordeals , telling Stern , " My mother never gave me sandwiches , even though she knew I would have loved them . She 'd give me what was inside , and even the bread , but not sandwiches . " Most of the time she would listen to Stern , though , sitting with great and shimmering eyes as he told of New York ; and when he was finished , she would say , " You really are different . You 're not interested in shoes or dancing . You 're the most different person I know . " Their talks were only bridges , and when it seemed to Stern they had put in enough time at it so that he could feel they legitimately interested one another , he wouldp41begin to kiss her and bite her and stroke her and undress her and examine her while she stood or sat calmly , great eyes shining , and let him explore her body . When he touched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she would do a private , nervous , whimpering thing beneath him . They clung to each other all over the campus , and sometimes she came to his room with nothingbeneath her summer dress . She would wheel about him , nude and happy , while Stern feigned calmness and watched her with held breath as though it were a scholarlyexercise . Then his loins would go weak and he would sail at her and bite her thighs too hard . He did crazy , tangled things to her , thinking he would break her frail body , but when he had finished she would come to him with great eyes wide , scrape his neck with her nails , and ask him to " be a man again . " One night , after finding the very middle of her in a new way , he called her later , trembling , and said , " I should n't have done that to you . Let 's not do it again . " But they did it again the next night in his room and the fiddler opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught them at it . Stern , in an action he could not explain , carried her , without a word to the old man , out the window and to the garden below , and they never did that thing again . They parted for a year . She stayed in Oregon , and Stern , heavy with guilt as he stole a final bite , flew to New York in search of girls who knew Turgenev . A great singingfreedom came over him , but the closest he came to a Turgenev lover in the following weeks was a divorcee 's daughter who lived in midtown , tossed her hair , ate exquisitely , and said often , with appealing phoniness , " PerhapsI 'll sleep with you . Perhaps I sha n't . " Mostly for Stern it was a time of long and lonely calls to Oregon while he tried to see how long he could stay away . One night her phone voice said , " The funniest thing . A Vene/zuelan wants to marry me . He has two children , but he says he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " Stern flew with nausea to Oregon in bad weather and saw her at the airport , her great eyes lovelier than before , the Venezuelan at her side . They did an intricate Latin dance for Stern , and she said , " Look what we do together . We 're always dancing . " Stem excused himself to vomit in the men 's room , but when he emerged he pretended to be confident and the Latin took his leave . In a hotel room , she said , " You 're losing your hair , " and Stern said , " I do n't understand this Venezuela bit . " " I enjoy his company very much , " she said , and Stern , a vomit swiftly coming on , feigned coolness one last time and said , " I 'm packing . " She let him fold his T-shirts and then put her head deep into his lap and said , " I 've been so lousy bad , " and he knew he was bound to her for a hundred years . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though a small , cold jail cell of steel had dropped out of the sky , encircling Stern 's heavy body , surrounding his movement . He tried to free himself of it ; he bought his son a trampoline . The boy saw it and said , " Daddy , put a rope in the sky so when I jump I 'll be able to catch it and stay up there . Maybe God will catch me . God has the biggest muscle in the world . " Weekend afternoons , Stern would watch his son jump sturdily on it , feeling this would build his body and protect him from banister falls . One day , the two of them heard a shot and a long crinkling of glass and saw a boy of about eighteen fly by in the street , as though he had been fired from a gun , and land on the concretestreet , his arms stiffly at attention , a soldier still marching . Fingers had broken off him , and his face had swiftly turned black . Riding a motorcycle , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Stern 's housep43and collided with a speeding car , which had hit him head on . Stern took his son inside , not offering to be a witness , although he had seen the accident and knew the motorcycleboy was in the wrong . He just held his son tightly and kept him inside the rest of the winter , feeling the more the boy 's bones grew sturdy on the trampoline , the greater chance he would be shot out of a cannon onto the concrete . At the end of March that year , Stern went to cover his son at night and saw that the boy 's head had swelled to twice its size . Stern kissed the dead side while his wife called a doctor , who said , " You 've never called me before . I do n't come in the middle of nights unless you 're a regularpatient . " Stern said he would call the man and rehearsedthe things he would say to him , that he had no right to call himself a doctor , that he was a peasant son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor he would be selling diseased poultry to housewives . What kind of a man was he who could go to sleep while a child 's fever rose and his face grew large and moonlike ? He got on the phone and said , " I want to tell you that I know what you said to my wife . You would n't say it to a man . " The doctor repeatedwhat he had said , and Stern choked , " It 's a shame . " They called a second man , Dr. Cavalucci , hesitant because of his home remedies . When Stern 's chest had been inflamed or his wife 's fingers had curled in shock , Cavalucci , the doctor , a soft , youthful man , wary of pills , had chuckled and begun , " Now I know this is going to sound funny , but you know those shopping bags you get at the supermarket ? If you take one of them and breathe deeply into it for half an hour , you 'll get to feeling better . " His treatments always involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the kind you open with a penny , brown , preferably . " And he would always beginp44his instructions by saying , " This is going to make you feel silly , but ... " That night he touched the heavy side of the boy 's face and said , " I do n't have one for his case . I 'm takinghim in . " In the ambulance , Stern held the child , but now he kissed the good side of the face , afraid of what was inside the bad one , and ashamed of himself for feeling that way , and finally kissing lightly the bad side , too . He said to the doctor , " Anything I 've got . Anything I own . Just make him better . " But he felt as though he were giving a performance and wondered how many other men had said the same thing . The hospital had long corridors and Stern had heard it was good but needed grants . Inside , a cluster of young men gathered round the child , and when Cavalucci said they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be calling in men from Europe . When Stern was a child , a cousin of his had once fallen in love with a dying girl , and Stern remembered hearing that he had done everything for her , even to the point of " bringing in men from Europe . " The phrase " men from Europe " had stuck with Stern , and he wondered how you went about getting them . It seemed so hopeless , standing in the children 's ward now , just to go to the phone and get some of them over , and yet he felt that if he were a real father he would stop at nothing and bring several across . The doctors talked near the child , and when Stern asked what they were doing , Cavalucci said that two of them did n't want to go in and disturb the area and one did . Stern asked which one wanted to disturbit , and Cavalucci pointed him out . He was the surgeon . When the conference broke up , Stern glared at him but was afraid that now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disturb the area but also try risky , **28;3650;TOOLONG . They waited round the clock while the live part of the face took food , and then Sternp45and his wife went home awhile and ate veal cutlets . They looked at each other after every bite , and when they had finished , Stern said . " He 's lying there , his face as big as a house , and I just ate veal cutlets and kept them down . " And then Stern wondered whether to call Winkel and whether Winkel still took cases and could come , because in his heart he still felt that all other doctors would be wrong except Winkel . As a child , being sick had not been altogether a bad time for Stern . He would lie in his mother 's bed and listen to radio shows all day , and then at night , when his fever rose , he would pull up the covers and wait to hear his father 's whistle down the street , meaning he was back from work . A minute or so after the whistle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bedroom door and say , " Jesus Christ . . . hmmph . . . oh , Jesus Christ , " and shake his head sympathetically . Then , the first night of the sickness , Winkel would come , his hulking body supported by reedlike legs , and thump gravely at Stem 's chest and back with thin , businesslike fingers . He liked cherry sodas , and Stem 's mother would always have one ready for him after he finished up and washed his hands . She was a tall , voluptuous woman with dyed blond hair who wore bathrobes whenever Stem was sick . " Do you know what I would do for that man ? " Stem 's mother would say after Winkel had left . " I owe him my life . He 's some guy . " Stem 's mother would then send Winkel a pair of tickets for the opera . When Stern got older , he would say , " But you paid him for coming , " and his mother would answer , " You ca n't really pay a man like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing up to do . " Winkel was always grave and unsmiling with Stem , and once when Stem had a stubborn pimple above his eye , Winkelp46squeezed it with what seemed to Stem like hatred and said , " Love sweets , do n't you ? " Though Winkel later specialized in gynecology , he continued to treat Stern in his teens , and Stern 's mother said , " I thank my lucky stars ten times a day I have a maxi like that . You have a man like that , you do n't need anyone else . " Nine out of ten of Stern 's boyhood friends were planning to become doctors , and there was a time when Stern considered the idea too . His mother told Winkel and the doctor said , " Why does n't he ever come up and talk to me ? All the other boys come up and we have long talks . " Stern did not like the sound of those long talks and never went up . He knew a little about chromosomes and Ehrlemeyer flasks , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Winkel . Later , when Stern went to college , he heard that Winkel had gone on to great eminence , giving talks on television . " I can still get him , though , " his mother would say . " I 'm the only one he 'll still come to . " Winkel had been married to a woman whose frugality supposedlymade him insane . Driving from Newark to the opera one night , Winkel and his wife , so the story went , had gone off the road and into a tree , the windshield shattering and glass getting into Winkel 's head . With half an hour remaining to curtain time , his wife left him in the car , forehead red , hands locked about the wheel in shock , and went to redeem the tickets . Weeks later , he ran amok while performing an appendectomy and cut two deep crosses in his kneecaps with a scalpel . Now he sat in a room , his practice gone , coming into the street only for occasional cherry sodas . Stern knew what his mother would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son . " Even with half a mind he knows more than anyone else . Do you know how big that man was ? And I can still get him , too . He 'll come to me in two seconds if I want him , no matter how crazy he is. "  |p47The  swelling disappeared mysteriously one morning , and in a few days Stern , with a leaping heart , was able to carry his son into his car and back to the house . He kept his nose deep in his son 's neck and marveled that some good had come out of the sickness . He had finally been among people in this bleak town , nurses and doctors and visitors in the halls . A day later , he spotted a blossom on the cancer side of the wild cherry tree  --  and there were other things , too , that happened quickly . A new stop sign on Stern 's corner , one that would prevent motorcycle boys being shot out of cannons ; a shortcut across the estate ; a plan to kill his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dogs . And then , of course , a week afterward , the man had said kike and looked between his wife 's legs . There were only three other occasions on which Stern and his wife discussed the kike man . One occurred the very next night when Stern , still in his topcoat , caught her wrists around the oven and said , " I just want to see how it happened . " " What do you mean ? " she said . " I want to get a picture in my mind of what it was all about . Get on the floor and show me exactly how you were . How your legs were when you were down there . It 's important . " " I wo n't do that , " she said , breaking through to clean the oven . " I 've got to see it , " said Stem , grabbing her again . " Just for a second . " " I 'm not going to do anything like that . I told you to forget it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , taking her around the waist , he threw her to the kitchen floor , her jumper flying back above her knees.  | " You crazy bastard , " she said , flicking a strip of skin from his nose in a quick swipe and getting to her feet . " All right , then  --  me , " said Stern , getting on the floor . " My topcoat 's your dress . Tell me when I 'm right . " He drew the coat slightly above his knees and said , " This way ? " " I 'm not doing this , " his wife said . " I do n't know what you want me to do . " " Were you this way ? " he asked . " Just tell me that . " " No , " she said . He drew the coat up higher . " This ? " " Uh-uh , " she said . He flung the overcoat back over his hips , his legs sprawling , and said , " This way ? " " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and ran upstairs to sink in agony upon the bed . But he felt excited , too . On the weekend , several days later , as Stern unloaded cans of chow mein from the supermarket , his wife said , " He has big arms . " " Who ? " Stern asked , knowing full well who she meant . " The man , " she said . " The man who said that thing . " " Oh , " Stern said . " What do arms mean ? " The third and final time was when they sat one day beneath a birch tree while their son dug a hole in the dirt to China . The kike man drove by in his car and Stern 's wife said , " I hate that man . " " You 're silly , " Stern said . The man 's house lay at a point equidistant between Stern 's and the estate . Since Stern did not want to pass the man 's house on foot anymore , he took to driving his car back and forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estate edge each morning and picking it up at night . Once he was in his car at night , he had a choice of eitherp49driving directly past the man 's house or taking a more roundabout route that avoided the man 's house altogether . Each night , as he boarded the train , he would begina struggle within himself as to which road to take . The roundabout road presented the more attractive view and Stern told himself there was no earthly reason why he should have to pass up the nicer scenery along this road . The houses were much handsomer and made Stem feel he lived in a more expensive neighborhood . Stem would start off along the finer road , but when he had gone fifty yards , he would throw his car into reverse , back up , and go down the road that led past the man 's house . It was much shorter this way , of course , and Stern told himself now that distance should be the only consideration , that if he took the roundabout road , he was only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's house and was being a coward , afraid that the man would pull him out of the car and break his stomach . On the few occasions when he did follow the roundabout road all the way home , he would walk past his wife and son and lie in bed , sinking his teeth into his top lip . On most occasions , however , he drove right past the man 's house , going very slowly to show he knew no fear . His license said , " Driver must wear glasses , " and Stem could not drive well without them , but when he went past the man 's house he slipped them off to present a picture of strength , squinting for sight so he could stay on the road . Past the house , he would duck down and slip them on again , shoulders hunched in such a way that if the man was looking after Stern , he would not see the glasses . One night Stern drove by and saw the man 's son , who would have been his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curb . From that night on , Stern drove very close to the curb , imagining that he would suddenly speed up , catch the boy on his bumpers , and then go thep50remaining mile in seconds , disappearing undetected into his garage . And then he pictured a car fight in which the man would get Stern 's boy , following him onto the lawn and pinning him against the drainpipe , while Stern , waitingupstairs , held his hands over his ears , blocking out the noise . The man would then , somehow , pick off Stern 's wife in her kitchen and then drive upstairs and finish off Stern himself , cringing in his bedroom . Another night , Stern forced himself to examine the name on the man 's mailbox . De Luccio . He looked it up in the telephone book that night and saw that there were eighteen others in the town . Even if he were to defeat the man , an army of relativesstood by to take his place . He wondered who he could pit against them and came up only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a store in San Diego . Once she had helped him in a snowball fight , and back to back they had done well together , until the action speeded up and ice balls began to get her in the breasts . " Stop it ; she 's a girl , " Stern hollered , but a heavy ball split her brow and down she went , making a yowling , nasal sound . But she 'd been game , standing firmly in the snow , puffing , blowing the hair out of her face , panting like a puppy . He imagined her now , back to back with him against the eighteen heavy-armed De Luccios , standing game as a puppy , until they all began to beat her breasts and easily knock her to the ground . Who else might have stood off the De Luccios ? When alive , perhaps his Uncle Henny , the shoulder pad tycoon , a man of iron grip who 'd been gassed in WW I. Once he had disarmed an aged knife wielder on a moving city bus . Uncle Henny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not see a picture of it in his mind , but he was sure that Uncle Henny would have been able to use his gassed lungs and steel grip to fend off the De Luccios.  |p51His  own father ? There had been another De Luccio long years past , an orphan boy of supple athlete 's body and golden hair who had kept Stern in terror for several years . The orphan would appear suddenly in an alley with a great laugh , fling Stem against a wall , lift him high , and drop him down , steal his jacket in the cold , and run away with it , come back , and punch Stem 's eyes to slits . Stem never told his parents , afraid the orphan boy would come up to his three rooms , force his way in , and kill Stern 's small father . One day , Stem stood talking to his father on the street when the orphan boy appeared , running a comb through his great piles of hair . " Who 's that ? " asked Stern 's small father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Sort of , " said Stern , his heart freezing . " I think it 's Rudy Vallee , " said his father . Others against the De Luccio army ? How about his mother-in-law , the Hungarian woman ? Stern 's wife told him that once , as a little girl , she had been abused by a teacher and her Hungarian mother had gone to school and spat upon the antique teacher 's face . Once , in an argumentwith his great-eyed wife , they both had sunk low and Stern had said , " Your mother did n't spit on the teacher . She peed on her . " He saw her now against the De Luccios , slowly moving forward , peeing and spitting them backward until they turned on her and pummeled her old woman 's stomach . Stern took note of every detail of the man 's house , a new one registering each night as he drove by . A televisionaerial . This was good . It meant the communicationsindustry was getting through to the man , subtly driving home messages of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , contemptuously flicking off all shows that spoke of tolerance . Stern saw himself writing and producing a show about fair play , getting itp52shown one night on every channel , and forcing the man to watch it since the networks would be bare of Westerns . Empty beer cans in the garbage pail . Excellent . Enough of them , taken over a period of years , would bloat his belly and deprive his arms of power . Stem wondered how much beer it would take to run a man down physically . He felt good on nights when entire cases sat atop the garbage pail and depressed when only a few scattered cans appeared . The man 's car was of prewar vintage , neatly shined and proudly kept , and as Stem drove by in his more recent Studebaker he thought to himself , " Maybe it 's an economicthing . He resents my having a newer car and a bigger house . I 'll take him inside and show him my empty rooms and he 'll see how foolish he is , and then we 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had a newer car . He wanted to say to the man , " Think kike things and be stupid and you 'll always have an old car . Act enlightenedand have a new one . " One night he saw the man 's wife walk to the gutter to shake a broom  --  a stocky , square , and graceless woman whose hair was without color . Stem imagined the pair at night , coming together for a graceless , hulking lay , and for a second he felt tender toward the man . There had to be gentleness in him . Once he must have had to come to this hulking woman and court her with kindness and modesty , kike thoughts the furthest thing from his mind . But , on the following night , Stern took in a sight that made his throat turn over . As he drove by , the man was looming up in front of him , standing , hands in pockets , on the lawn and wearing a veteran 's organization jacket . It meant he had come through the worst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his breath in foxholes for hours at atime and then sneak out to slit a throat in silence . He was skilled as a foot fighter and went always with deadlyaccuracy to a man 's groin . Stern pictured him at veteran beer parties , drawing laughs with stories of the kike who 'd moved in down the way a mile . He 'd probably had one in his outfit , a thin and scholarly dark fellow who 'd slowed down campaigns . No amount of brotherhood shows would ever make a dent in his veteran 's jacket . Frightened of the jacket , Stern realized that he had never really seen the man 's face , that he knew only the heaviness of his arms , an inclination of the head , and a certain wetness at the mouth . A mailbox lay opposite the man 's house , and one night Stern saved a letter and stopped his car on the corner near the box . His glasses off , he inflated his chest for an appearance of power , flexed his soft arms , and trotted to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , facing the man 's house now , trotted back to his car . Stern , his glasses on the seat , could see only that the man was hooked over his car engine and that , as he trotted back to the car , the man came out of his hook and inclined his head . But , trotting as he was , Stern could make out no details of the man 's face and remained in ignorance of his features . Another night the man was nowhere in sight and Stern 's eyes fixed on the license plates of his car , the two first letters registering " GS . " For some reason , Stem , though he looked at the plates for several nights running , could not commit the numbers to memory . But he remembered the letters and made up a organization they might have stood for , Guardian Sons , a group of twenty who sat around on Monday nights and cackled over kikes . Each time Stern saw a prewar car with " GS " letters he was certainit was the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled with leaflets . He seemed to see such cars everywhere . Driving past the man 's house , he wondered whether he might be able to steal back in dead of night and destroy the car , dismantling the wiring , andp54then make it back to his own house undetected . Or could police always pick up evidence of footsteps and tire tracks ? And was the man a light sleeper , nerves sharpened by combat , waiting coiled and ready to leap forward and slit throats with commando neatness ? On clear weekend days during that summer , Stern was able to look straight down the street as far as a mile or so and make out the man playing softball in the road with neighboring boys . On such days , Stern would go back inside his house , his day ruined . And often , inside the house , he would think about his Jewishness . As a boy , Stern had been taken to holiday services , where he stood in ignorance among bowing , groaning men who wore brilliantly embroidered shawls . Stern would do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but when he sounded out he was certain one of the old genuine groaners had spotted him and knew he was issuing a phony . Stern thought it was marvelous that the old men knew exactly when to bow and knew the groans and chants and melodies by heart . He wondered if he would ever get to be one of their number . He went to Hebrew School , but there seemed to be no time at all devoted to the theatrical bows and groans , and even with three years of Hebrew School under his belt Stern still felt a loner among the chanting sufferersat synagogues . After a while he began to think you could never get to be one of the groaners through mere attendance at Hebrew School . You probably had to pick it all up in Europe . At the school , Stern learned to read Hebrew at a mile-a-minute clip . He was the fastest reader in the class , and when called upon he would race across the jagged words as though he were a long-distance track star . The meaning of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never got to them , hep55remained only a swift reader who might have been performingin Swahili or Urdu . He had two teachers , one a Mr. Lititsky , who concentrated on the technique of wearingyarmulkes and hit kids with books to keep order in the class . He had poor control over the classroom and would go from child to child , slamming an odd one here and there with a textbook and saying , " Now let 's get some order here . " By the time he had some , the half hour was up and there was time only for a fast demonstration of how to slip on a yarmulke . Outside , some of those slammed with books would say , " If he does that again , I 'm going to hit Lititsky in the titskys , " always sure to draw howls of laughter . His other teacher was a black-eyed beauty from the Middle East named Miss Ostrow who told stories of Palestinian oases , referring to Palestine over and over as " the land of milk and honey , " while Stern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commodities should be so desirable . Miss Ostrow was beautiful and wore loosely cut Iraqi blouses , and Stern loved her , although he preferred to think of her as American-born and not to dwell on her earlier days in the Palestinian date groves . She cast him as the wicked Egyptian king , Ahasuerus , in a Purim play and , until the date of the play , called him " my handsome Ahasuerus . " One day , after school , she caught Stern in a crowd in front of a drugstore and embarrassed him by standing on tiptoe and waving , " Ahasuerus . " All Hebrew School led up to the Bar Mitzvah and the singing of the Haftarah . Stern , who had a good voice , took to trilling occasional high notes in his practice Haftarah rendition , and the Haftarah coach would say , " No crooning . " On the day of his Bar Mitzvah , Stern sang it flawlesslyand his mother , afterward , said , " You had some voice . I could have fainted. "  | " Yes , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crooning . " No great religious traditions were handed down to Stern by his small , round-shouldered father . He was selfconsciouson the subject , and a favorite joke of his was to create some outrageous supposition , such as " Do you know why we 're not allowed in the Chrysler Building after eleven at night ? " When Stern or his mother would answer " Why ? " Stern 's small dad would say slyly , " Becausewe 're Jews , " mouthing the final word with great relish and pronouncing it " chooze . " Stern 's mother would then double up with laughter and Stern would join in , too . A bad punster whose favorite gag word was " homogenize " ( " I homogenize saw you on the street last night " ) , Stern 's small dad had great fun with such phrases as " orange Jews " and " grapefruit Jews . " When Stern would say , " I heard that , Dad , " his father would say , " Yeah , but I 'll bet you never heard prune Jews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , and on the first night of the celebration Stern and his parents traditionally attended a Seder in the back-room apartment of his Aunt Edda 's hardware store , which was closed for the holiday . ( After the final prayers , Aunt Edda switched on the lights of the store and each of the Sedergoersput in a large order for hardware items , which Aunt Edda furnished them at cost . ) A small , dark-haired woman with tiny feet , Aunt Edda was much revered by the other members of the family , and Stern 's mother often referred to her as a " saint " and then added , " Even though she 's got more money than God . " When Stern walked into Seders , Aunt Edda would run to him on tiny feet , clasp his arm , and say , " I want to tell you something , " after which she would stare into his eyes , hold his arm for a long time , and then say , " You 're some darling boy . " Asidep57from arranging the Seder , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body into the center of the Seder fights that broke out annually . One of the main antagonists was Stern 's Uncle Sweets , who presided over the ceremonies  --  a wild-haired man with giant lips who was involved in clandestine Chicago rackets and once , bound hand and foot , had to climb out of a lake in southern Illinois to save his life . Stern was proud of him and referred to him as " my bookie uncle . " He took Stern and his parents to restaurants , always ordering meat pies and picking up the checks ; outside a seafood villa once , a hobo had asked him for a handout and Uncle Sweets had put a penny in his palm and offered it to the man . When the hobo went to get it , Uncle Sweets had doubled up his palm and driven his fist into the man 's nose , spreading the nose across the hobo 's face with a sloshing sound Stern never forgot and leaving the man in the gutter . Stern 's father said , " Hmm , " and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " with an excited look in her eyes . Uncle Sweets , wrapped sacredly in embroidered shawls , presided over the entire ceremony with thick lips and heavy lids , poundinghis chest , quaffing wine , and singing long passages with the sweet full voice and passionate fervor of an old choir boy , as though this was his one night to atone for all the mysterious goings-on in Chicago . Challenging him each year and breaking in with his own set of more militantchants was Stern 's Uncle Mackie , squat , powerfully built , burned black from the sun , a Phoenix rancher who flew in each year for Seders and to have mysterious medical things done to his " plumbing . " An eccentric man who had once chased Pancho Villa deep into Mexico at General Pershing 's side , Uncle Mackie , when asked about his health , would bare his perfect , gleaming teeth , double over his bronzed , military-trim body , and croak , " I feel pretty lousy . " Early in the evening , he would take Sternp58around the waist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just want to find out something . Do you still make peepee in your pants ? " And then he would explode with laughter , until he checked himself , held his side , and said , " I 've got to do something about the plumbing . " He continued the peepee inquiries long into Stem 's teens . When the Seder began , Uncle Sweets would take long difficult passages to himself , which gave him an opportunity to hit high notes galore , but soon Uncle Mackie , warming to the Seder , would break in with great clangor , doing a series of heroic-sounding but clashing chants that seemed to have been developed outdoors in Arizona . Beforelong , Uncle Sweets would stop and say to him , " What the hell do you know ? You shit in your hat in Phoenix . " And Uncle Mackie would fly at him , saying , " I 'll kick your two-bit ass through the window . " At this point , Aunt Edda would seize both their wrists , say , " I want to tell you something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one to the other , and then say , " You 're both darling boys . " The Seder would then continue uneasily , much tension in Uncle Sweets ' choruses , Uncle Mackie continuing with much vigor but directing his efforts to another side of the room , as though trying to enlist a faction to his banner and start a split Seder . Stem wondered who he wanted to win in a fight , his bookie uncle or the peepee man who 'd gone in after Pancho Villa . At the same point in every Seder , Stem 's father would arise to do a brief prayer , reading in a barely perceptible whisper and in a strange accent Stern had never heard in Mr. Lititsky 's class . He read uncertainly , flashing his teeth as though charm would compensate for a poor performance ; others at the Seder would root him on , hollering out key words , while Stern stared at the floor , ashamed of his father 's uncertain whispers and wishing he had a militant chanter for a dad . Toward the tail end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off to the bedroom , get a dictionary , and look up dirty words , such as " vulva " and " pudendum . " They would then open their flies and compare pubic hair growths , Flip 's always being further along since he was six months the elder . They would generally emerge in time for Uncle Gunther 's entrance . A onetime Hollywood bit player who had done harem scenes in silents , Gunther worked a lathe in a ball bearing factory , drank heavily , and was always striding into speeding cars . Tension generallybuilt throughout Seders as to whether he 'd make it this year ; when he did show , there would be great reliefthat he had n't gotten caught on a fender . Aunt Edda would fix him an abbreviated Seder meal , and when he had finished it , the others would begin to confer gifts upon him in deference to his lowly lathe job . Uncle Gunther would wave them off disdainfully , saying , " What do you think I am , " and finally race out the door and into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth their gifts , a crumpled twenty-dollar bill from Uncle Sweets , advice on life from Uncle Mackie of the Far West . Stern 's small father would always take off an item of clothing , a vest or belt , and holler , " What do I need it for , you fool , " at the fleeing Gunther , who would stop after a while , collect the items , and allow himself to be ushered back to the store , defeated ; there , Aunt Edda stood waiting for him , holding sets of pots and pans and the uneaten Seder food , wrapped in packages and tied with string . And thus the curtain would come down on another religious holiday . The most religious person Stern knew was his grandmother , who opened the neighborhood synagogue each morning at five-thirty in cold weather or warm . In argumentswith friends as to whose grandmother was more religious , Stern would weigh in with " Mine opens thep60damned synagogue , " and he would generally walk off with the honors . A woman of indeterminate age with long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her last years in a small flat in a house near Stern 's apartment building , which she shared with another grandmother . Since her own flat faced a back alley and had no front windows , she would come and spend most of the day in Stern 's apartment , where she could sit at the window , look out , and see light and people . Most of the day she prayed , bowing and singing softly and wetting the pages of her prayer book as she slapped them along . She wore coat sweaters and had long breasts that hung down to her waist ; Stern , horrified by them , wondered nevertheless what old women 's breasts were like  --  yet hoped he 'd never have to look at a set . When she was finished praying , she would look out the window and spot other grandmothers and laugh at them all for having crooked feet . Stern 's father teased her , and whenever he spotted another old lady in the street , he would say , " There goes one of her buddies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them organized . " Her mind slipped and she buried bits of food around Stern 's apartment , a piece of lettuce here , a slice of orange there , under sofa cushions and behind vases . When Stern 's father found one , he would say , " She 's got enough buried to feed an army . Probably got a load of money , too . " Stern was going to high school during this period , and when he got home each afternoon , she would be waiting with the daily newspapers , asking Stern to explain the headlinesto her since she knew little English . No matter what they said  --  " Strike to Tie Up Pier " or " Cold Weather to Continue "  --  she would take them to be an accounting of one of Hitler 's misdeeds and would heap curses upon his head . Her eyesight was poor , and in the evening , when the light faded , it fell upon Stern to take her home so she would not be hit by cars in crossing the severalp61streets on the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job and would say , " I do n't want to be walking with grandmothers . " Since her wind was short , it took an agonizingly long time to get her back each night . She would grip his arm , they would walk thirty paces or so , and she would ask him to stop so she could catch her breath . During the stops , Stern would shuffle his feet and say , " Are you ready ? " Sometimes , with his grandmother on his arm , he would pass friends in front of a bowling alleyand he would say , " This is my grandmother , " as the friends watched the pair creep by . When Stern came home from summer camp one year , he said to his mother , " Where 's Granma ? " And she said , " She 's gone . " Stern said , " What do you mean ? " And his mother said , " She 's not here any more . She went in my arms when you were away . " People never died in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or they " went " or they " were taken . " Stern said , " I see , " and went inside and cried into a pillow , sorry he had laughed at her Hitler curses and wishing he could take her to her flat one more time , giving her long rests on the way . He wondered , too , whether anyone would ever " go " in his arms and , if they were an old person , what it would be like , whether their breath would be bad and whether the air would go out of their long breasts  --  and then he punched himself in the eyes to rid himself of such thoughts . And so Stern loved a bowing grandmother and sat through Seder duels and could race with furious speed through books of ancient Hebrew ; but there was little God to his religion . When Stern went to college in Oregon , even the trappings fell away . He told the people he met at school , " I do n't care much about being a Jew . There 's only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear the Shofar blown on Rosh Hashanah . It sort of ties thep62years together for me . " And it was true that for a while Stern 's last concession to his early Jewish days was to stand outside synagogues each year and listen to the ram 's horn . It was as though listening to the ancient sound would somehow keep him just the tiniest bit Jewish , in case it turned out someday that a scorecard really was kept on people . One year he did n't go , however , and then he rarely went again , even though he kept using that " ties the years together " line when he met new girls and needed impressive attitudes . Before Stern met his wife at college and lived with the old man of dangling pelvic supports , he stayed in a boardinghouse of Jewish students , where the air was thick with self-consciousness . One of his two room-mates was a tall graceful redheaded boy with a monotonous voice that sounded as though he were in a telephone booth . His personality was limited , and since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked him for a match , he would answer , " Sure , my ass and your face " ) , he became known as " Gordon One-Gag . " " I 've got lots of jokes , " he would protest from inside his booth , to which Stern or the other room-mate would say , " Nonsense , One-Gag , you 've only got one gag . " Stern 's other room-mate was a small , flabby ex-Navy man named Footsy who had motherly-looking breasts and a large fund of anal jokes developed on shipboard . There grew up among the three a jargon and patter , all of which hinged on Jewishness . The motherly Navy man might suddenlyarise during a study period , hold his stomach , and leave the room . " Where are you going ? " the redhead might ask , to which Footsy would answer , " I ca n't stand the Jewishness in the room , " bringing forth howls of amusement . Or Stern might make a remark about the weather , to which the Navy man would say , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stern were to utter a pronouncement of any kind , one of his room-mates would invariably re/tort : " Said with characteristic Jewishness . " Long imaginarydialogues were carried on between the redhead and the Navy man in which the redhead was a job applicant and Footsy was an employment director , reluctant to hire him . Finally , Footsy , prodded to explain why , would say briskly , " Well , if you must know , it 's because of certain minority characteristics we 'd rather not go into , " and all in the room would break up laughing . The Navy man would often do a storm trooper imitation , in which he got to say , " Line dem opp against the fwall and commence mit the shooting , " and a boy down the hall named Wiegel who had sick feet would come in and do another German officer , saying , " Brink in the Jewish child . Child , ve eff had to execute your parents . " The redhead would try Mussolini in his last days , but Footsy , the Navy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gag . " Footsy would lie in bed for hours twisting lyrics of popular songs to get Jews into them : " Beware my foolish heart " became " Beware my Jewish heart , " " Fool that I am " turned into " Jew that I am , " and " I 'm glad I met you , wonderful you " emerged " I 'm glad you 're Jewish , you wonderful Jew . " Stern chipped in with a full lyric that went ( to the tune of " Farmer in the Dell " ) : The Jews caused the war . The Jews caused the war . We hate the JewsBecause they caused the war . On occasion , the president of the boardinghouse , a short boy with quivering old-man jowls , would appear in the room and say , " These things are n't funny , " after which Footsy would poke Stern in the ribs and whisper , loud enough for all to hear , " He 's being very Jewish , " and the president would stomp off , jowls in a rage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little attention was paid to the girls of the single Jewishp63sorority , who wore the traditional campus skirts and sweaters but who seemed somehow an acne-ed , largeshoulderedparody of the brisk , blond girls of the gentile sororities . Only sick-footed Wiegel took out what Footsy described as " laughing , dark-eyed beauties . " When Wiegelannounced that he 'd booked another for Saturday night , Footsy would say , " But she 's a pig , " to which Wiegel would answer , " Yes , but you 've got to date the pigs to get to the gentile queens . " Before dates , the redhead , all dressed , might stand beforeStern and say , " Check my hair . " " Fine , " Stern would say . " Suit ? " " Excellent . " " Check me for Jewishness . " " Reject , " Stern would say , and all would become convulsed . Footsy would then bare a womanly breast and say , " Here , One-Gag , practice on this little beauty . " After dates , all would compare how they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Knee and conversation , " the redhead might say , and Stern would add he 'd gotten " elbow and upper thigh . " Footsy , who took out homelier girls , would generally have come through with " outside of bra , heavy breathing , and an ear job . " Then Stern and the redhead would get into their beds , turn out the lights , and listen to Footsy do a high-pitched imitation of an imaginary date being seducedby any one of the room-mates . " Oh , Gordon , you 're very cute , but I ca n't possibly do any screwing . I 'll take off my panties , but you 've got to promise there 'll be no screwing . You promise ? " Footsy 's voice was so convincing and the girl so appealing that Stern and Wiegel ( who often came in late at night for the imitations , rubbing his sick feet ) would beg him to do another , substituting their names.  |p64Going  along with the Jewish comedy routines , Stem began to call Footsy , his motherly , good-natured roommate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he woke up , he 'd say , " Morning , Little Jew , " and after classes he would ask , " How 's Little Jew getting along ? " It sounded good on Stem 's tongue , nice and comfortable . He said it in two syllables , and it came out " Gee-yoo , " and when he said it , he would bare his teeth and get a disgusted look on his face , which he felt would add to the irony and comic effect of the routine . It was fun to say , and he began to call Footsy " Little Gee-yoo " at every possible opportunity , making terrible faces and then poking Footsy in the ribs with a laugh . It made him feel fine to keep saying it . One day the three room-mates were on their way to the ice-cream parlor where gentile girls hung out after class . Each time a group of girls walked by , Footsy would say to the redhead , " Tell them your one gag , One-Gag . That 'll have them swarming all over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What did the little Gee-yoo think of that group ? " At the ice-cream parlor , Stem held the door for Footsy , saying , " You first , Little Gee-yoo , " and Footsy turned and said , " No more . " " What do you mean , Little Gee-yoo ? " " Do n't call me that any more . " " The Little Gee-yoo does n't like to be called Little Gee-yoo . Little Gee-yoo . Little Gee-yoo . " It felt so good that Stem said it a few more times . The three were inside the ice-cream parlor now , and Footsy said , " If you keep doing that , I have something I 'll call you . " " There 's nothing , Little Gee-yoo . Nothing at all . " " All right , Nose . What do you think of that ? I 'll call you Nose . Hello , Nose . Hello , Nose . " With tweed-skirted gentile girls listening , he began to scream out the name " Nose , Nose . Hello , Nose . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thin-faced and large-nosed at the time , flew out of the door and down the street , the cry following him back to the boardinghouse . At night the room-mates did not speak until , finally , Stern said , " OK , I wo n't call you the name if you do n't call me Nose , " ' to which Footsy nonchalantlysaid , " All right . " To break the tension , the redheadsaid , " Let me tell you my one gag . Does anyone have a match ? " And Footsy said , " Save it . " There was a strain between Stern and Footsy from then on . One day Stern inadvertently called him " Little Gee-yoo " again and added , " I 'm sorry . It slipped out . " Instead of overlooking it graciously , Footsy said , " That 's all right , Nose . " " I said I did n't mean it , " Stern apologized . " That 's all right , " said Footsy . " You 're getting one for one . " At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would separate and Stern went to live with the old man who wore elastic gadgets on his groin . In the Air Force , Stern , recently married and swiftly packing on hip fat , felt isolated , a nonflying officer in a flying service , at a time when the jets were coming in and there was no escaping them ; the air was full of strange new jet sounds and the ground reverberated with the throb of them . Somehow Stern connected his nonflying status with his Jewishness , as though flying were a golden , crew-cut , gentile thing while Jewishness was a cautious and scholarly quality that crept into engines and preventedplanes from lurching off the ground with recklessness . In truth , Stern feared the sky , the myriad buttonsand switches on instrument panels . He was afraid of charts with grids on them , convinced he could never master anything called grids , and he was in deadly fear ofp67phrases like " ultra high frequency " and " landing pattern . " He had a recurring dream in which he was a fighter pilot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resentedStern 's profile for spoiling the golden , blue-eyed look of the squadron . Each day the mechanic would stand by , neutral-faced , arms folded , while Stern , able to check his plane only peremptorily , took off with heavy heart , convinced wires had been crossed and would split his aircraftin mid-flight . Stern , who traveled to distant bases to do administrative Air Force things , rode once to Californiaas a guest on a general 's luxury B-17 , sitting alone in the bombardier 's bubble and feeling over Grand Canyon that he had been put in a special Jewish seat and sealed off from the camaraderie in the plane 's center . After eight hours of self-control , Stern felt the plane shudder and then hang uncertainly for a moment as it circled a West Coast Air Force base . He spread a thin layer of vomit around his bubble and then kneeled inside it as the plane landed , the pilots and other flying personnel filing by him in silence . Cowardly Jewish vomit staining a golden aircraft . Stern lusted after the tiny silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a Wyoming PX , he ducked his shoulders down and slipped on a pair , crouching as he did so that no one would see , holding his breath as though each second might be his last . Then he took them off and walked quickly out of the PX , feeling as though he 'd looked under a skirt . A great eagle sat atop the cap of every Air Force officer , flying or nonflying , and there were those in small towns , ignorant of insignia , who thought each Air Force man was a pilot clearing the skies of Migs above Korea . One day on Rosh Hashanah , Stern , shipped for a two-week tour to Illinois , walked into a small-town synagogue , his khakis starched , his brass agleam , asp68though he had scored a dozen flying kills and now sought relaxation . He 'd draped a tallith round his shoulders and stood , stooped with humility , in the last row of the temple , mouthing the prayer book words with all of his old speed . One by one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ midgets , turned and noticed him , and Stern , aware of their fond glances , sent forth some low groans and did several dipping knee bows he remembered from the old days . He did this to cheer them on further and to make it all the more marvelous that he , a man of the sky , took off precious flying time to pray in strange synagogues . Within minutes , the rabbi called him forward and began to heap honors upon his head . Not only was he allowed to read from the Torah but he got to kiss it , too , and then to escort it in a march around the synagogue . Ordinarily only one such honor was dealt out to a congregation member , and then only upon the occasionof a new grandson birth or wedding anniversary . The Torah back in its vault , Stern walked humbly to his seat , aware of the loving glances the tiny Jews kept shootinghim . Was n't it wonderful ? A Jewish boy . A fighter . A man who had shot down planes . Yet when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such sweetness comes to sit in synagogues . And did you see him pray ? Even in a uniform he reads so beautifully . Stern loved it , and when they shot him glances , he responded with religious groans and dipping bows and as much humility as he could summon . When the Shofar had blown , they clustered around him , touching him , telling him what a handsome Jewish boy he was , saying how wonderful it must be to fly . They knew Jewish boys did accounting for the Army . But Stern was the first they knew who flew in planes . Dinnerinvitations were flung at the savior , and Stem , silent on his nonflying status , his lips sealed on the subject of hisp69new bride , chose an orthodox watchmaker who did up timepieces for major league umpires and had a large and bovine unmarried daughter named Naomi . When Stem had finished dinner , he was left alone with the girl in a parlor that smelled of aged furniture , unchanged since it had been brought across from Albania after a pogrom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chopped liver and noodle pudding , swiftly got her breasts out . They were large and comfortable ones , the nipples poorly placed , glancing out in opposite directions and givingher a strange , dizzying look . Stern fell upon them while the girl settled back in bovine defeat , as though she were able to tell from the sucks , greedy , anxious and lacking in tenderness , that nothing of a permanent nature would come of this , just as nothing ever came of her father 's synagogue dinner invitations . She curled a finger through Stern 's hair and seemed to think of the procession of dark-skinned boys who had been at her chest , wonderingwhen a serious one would appear and want to wrap them up forever . Stern stayed at her breasts like a thief , dizzy with adulterous glee . They were large , his wife 's were small , and he stored up each minute as though it were gold . For hours he stayed upon her , expecting an exotic perfume he 'd dreamed about to cascade from her bosom . The offbalancearrangement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was afraid there would be equal strangeness beneath her skirts . Then , too , the room smelled old and religious and Stem imagined himself piercing her and thereby summoning up the wrath of ancient Hebraic gods , ones who would sleep benignly as long as he stayed above the waist . She lay beneath him with cowlike patience while the night went by , and then Stern rose , said , " I have to go back now , " and flew out ofp70the house , reeling with guilt , a day of flying heroism beneath his belt and four hours of capacious bosom-sucking engraved in his mind that no one could ever steal . Stern , a non-flier in a flying service , yearned for Air Force comrades but had only friends . There were two of them , non-fliers , with parasitic functions like those of Stern . One was Neidel , the Jewish captain , a finance officerwho made furtive afternoon calls to grain market brokers , picking up $20,000 in barley one day , dropping it in wheat the next . A regular officer , Neidel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for fear of having to divert money from soybean futures . Stern occasionally had lunch with him in Neidel 's old car , telling him of gentile girls from college while Neidel sweated and wolfed down economy coleslaw sandwiches he had prepared in the bachelor officer rooms . Stern 's other friend was Kekras , a Greek who had failed in jets . Once lean and blond , he drank heavily now and seemed a parody of gentile fliers , his hair grown long , his khakis soiled , his face swelled up with beer . Kekras burped a lot , said next to nothing , but was a great admirer of strength , and Stern got rises out of him only with apocryphal anecdotes of Charlie Keller , ancient Yankee outfielder . " He could carry seven baseballs in one hand , " Stern would report , and Kekras would shake his head and say , " What a monster . " " Some said he could even grab eight of them in his prime . " " Jesus , " Kekras would say . " I once saw him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He had the bushiest eyebrows I 'd ever seen on a man , and you should have seen his arms . They hung down to the ground like an ape 's . " " What a horse , " Kekras would say , grinning and shaking his head with affection . " What an ox . " And Stern wasp71thrilled that he was talking intimately with a gentile man of the air , even though a cast-off , heavy-lidded one whose senses were too dulled for the new jets . Stern felt like a thief throughout his Air Force tour , a sponger and a parasite , a secret vomiter masquerading in suits of Air Force blue with great heroic eagles perched atop his garrison cap . " I 'd feel more comfortable wearing a different kind of uniform than the fliers , " he 'd tell Kekras , while the Greek burped and wondered whether Dolph Camilli 's wrists were larger round than those of Johnny Mize . Only one brief moment did Stem feel in the Air Force and not an unwanted guest in a hostile house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On temporary duty in Wyoming one night , Stem had taken a seat at a bar in the officers ' club next to a buxom woman quickly labeled a " hooker " by the bartender  --  " one of the worst I 've seen in this club . " Stern , who felt he 'd married prematurely , now prowled tormentedly after women on his tours about the globe , keeping mental track of every loveless caress , every conversation , every female contact , as though only when he 'd grabbed a certain number of breasts , stroked a certain number of thighs , racked up a magic number of sleepings would he be able to relax and be married . Bracelets of lines ringed the woman 's neck , and she sat enclosed in a circle of cheap perfume , but the bourbon quickly got to Stern and turned the perfume into something desirably earthy , the neck lines into lovely chevrons of sophistication . Stern imaginedtaking her to his staff car , stripping off her undoubtedlyworn and tragic underwear , and allowing her to entertain him with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly to the bar , possibly with an easily cleared up disease upon him , but one delicious notchp72closer to his magic number of sleepings . Stern sidled close to the woman , an offer of a drink on his lips , when a romantic voice behind him rang out : " Come , woman , and drink my wine . I have need of company and you seem much woman to these eyes . " The hooker wheeled on her seat , said , " Scuse me , " to Stern , and joined the one who had called out  --  a husky middle-aged man with much blond hair curled romantically down over his forehead and with deep lines burned in his face . He was wearing civilian clothes and talked in a bleary-eyed , outrageously romantic way , rising gallantly for the hooker and telling her , " Woman , you 're a rare one and you 've wisdom in your smile . " When the hooker took her seat , the romantic man shouted to Stern , " Let the Jew join us , too . I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's face froze at the bar , but he came over and said , " What do you mean , Jew ? " And the man slapped his shoulder and said , " Let the Jew sit and take wine with us . " Stern , oddly at ease , sat down with the pair , uncomfortable only because the man was talking so loud . " Your company is good , woman , " the romantic man said , leaning back and drinking deeply . " Big Jew , you warm me with your presence . " He called Stern " Jew " and " Big Jew " each time he spoke to him , and he called the hooker " woman , " endowing her with a universalquality , and Stern felt a nice feeling of camaraderie sitting and drinking with the pair , the romantic gentleman who might have been an aging soldier of fortune and the wise and silent hooker who had been to many places and stayed with a legion of men . He felt as though he was in a small bar in Macao , among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world 's end now , saying only bitter , philosophical things and waiting to die . Ava Gardner a must for the film version . The romantic man , indeed , was a kind of soldier of fortune , a civilian flying instructor assigned to the Air Force . He had trained ap73small group of Israeli pilots during the Arab-Israeli war , and he had glowing things to say of Israeli skills . " You Jews fly well , Big Jew , " he said to Stern , who exulted in his words . " You fly a good plane , and my hat is off to the flying Jew . I 'll drink to you , Big Jew . You do well in the sky . " " I do n't actually fly myself , " Stem said , but the romantic man waved him off and said , " Big Jew , you fly a deadly plane . Drink deep with me . The woman drinks well , too . " The romantic gentleman went on extolling the virtues of Jewish pilots , and each time Stem insisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Let the Jew be silent and drink with me as a man of the sky . " A major Stem knew from the headquarters office came over with his wife then and stood alongside the table as the gentleman cried out , " The Big Jew is a modest man . Come , Jew , and tell us of your courage . " " That 's disgusting , " said the major 's wife , the sake of the new couple , he turned to the middle-aged soldier of fortune and said , " Quit that . Do n't keep calling me that . " The gentleman said , " I 've tasted too much of wine , " got to his feet unsteadily , and walked out of the club , the hooker supporting his arm . The couple sat beside Stern , but as soon as the middle-aged gentleman had gone , Stem wanted to call him back . He wanted to say to the couple , " You 're wrong . He was n't saying Jew ' like you think . He was saying Big Jew . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet Jew in a brigade of international fighters . I might have been the Big Swede or the Big Prussian , but I was the Big Jew , the quiet , silent one with bitter memoriesand a past of mystery , a man you could count on to slip silently through enemy lines and slit a throat , the one with skills at demolition who could blow a bridge a thousandways , brilliant at weaponry , a quiet man withp74strong and magic hands who could open any safe and fix an exhausted aircraft , fly it , too , if necessary . " Send the Big Jew . He knows how to kill . He 'll get through . He says little , but no one kills a man better , and it is said that when a woman has been to bed with him she will never be loved better as long as she lives . " Stern wanted to say these things to the major and his wife , just as now , ten years later , he wanted to go out of his house and say to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legs , " You 've got me wrong . I 'm no kike . Come and see my empty house . My bank account is lean . I drive an old car , too , and Cousy thrills me at the backcourt just as you . No synagogue has seen me in ten years . It 's true my hips are wide , but I have a plan for thinness . I 'm no kike . " But Stern said nothing , continuing to drive hunched and tense past the man 's house , until one night he saw a line of giant American flags flying thrillingly and patrioticallyfrom the man 's every window . At that moment a great flower of pain billowed up within Stern 's belly , filling him up gently and then settling like a parachute inside his ribs . He nursed it within him for several weeks , and then one evening , warming tea at midnight by the gas-blue light of the ancient kitchen stove , an electric shaft of pain charged through Stern 's middle and flung him to the floor , his great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though the kike man 's boot had stamped through Stern 's mouth , plunging downward , elevator-swift , to lodge finally in his bowels , all the fragile and delicate things within him flung aside.  |p77STERN  'S DOCTOR sent him first to a man with a forest of golden curls named Brewer who took pictures of his belly . Brewer had said , " Come very early ; it 's the only way I can get a lot of people in , " and when Stern arrived , he filled him first with thick , maltlike substances , then put him inside an eyelike machine , and , taking his place on the other side of it , said , " Think of delicious dishes . Your favorites . " Stern was barefooted and wore a thin shift ; the light in the streets had not yet come up and his eyes were crusted with sleep . " I may be sick , " he said . " How can I think of delicious things ? All right , eggs . " " Do n't fool around , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got to get a lot of people in . Give me your favorite taste temptations ; otherwise the pictures will be grainy . " I really do like eggs , " Stem said . " Late at night , when I 've been out , I 'd rather have them than anything . " " Are you trying to make a monkey out of me ? " the manp78screamed , darting away from the machine . " Do you know how many I have got to get in today ? You give me your favorites . " He flew at Stern , fat fists clenched , blond curls shaking , like a giant , enraged baby , and Stern , frightened , said , " Souffles , souffles . " " That ought to do it , " said the man , his eye to the machineagain . " I 'm not sending out any grainy pictures . " A week after the stomach pictures had been taken , Stern sat alongside an old woman with giant ankles in the outer office of Fabiola , the specialist , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad news in his life in this very office ; there would be today 's and then , at some later date , news of lung congestions and then , finally , right here in this very room with the wallpaper and leather couches that seemed specially designed for telling people hopeless things , he would get the final word , the news that would wrap up the ball game forever . The woman beside him sorrowfully tapped her feet to an obscureMuzak ballad and , although Stern knew it was cruel , he could not help passing along his observation . " This is a room for bad things , " he said . " All the bad news in your life you get right here , right to the very end . " " I ca n't think now , " she said , tapping away . " Not with these feet I ca n't . " Stern felt ashamed when he was called ahead of the giant-ankled woman , but then it occurred to him that perhapsher ankles had always been that way and were not swollen and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her there raged fifty years more of good health ; Stern was being called first because he was much further downhill , the slimness of his ankles notwithstanding . Fabiola was a tall , brisk man who wore loose-flowingp79clothes and lived in the shadow of an old doctor whose practice he had taken over , the famed Robert Lualdi , a handsome , Gable-like man who had been personal physicianto Ziegfeld beauties . Somewhat senile and in retirementnow , the elderly Lualdi , nevertheless , would drop in at odd times during the day , often while examinationswere in session , put his feet on the young doctor 's desk , and reminisce about the days when he had a practicethat was " really hotcha . " Once , when Fabiola was examininga young woman 's chest , the old man had come into the room , pronounced her breasts " honeys , " and then gone winking out the door . The interruptions kept the young doctor on edge , and he had developed a brisk style , as though trying always to wind things up and thereby head off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was holding the pictures of Stem 's stomach up to the light when Stem entered , fingers dug into his great belly , as though to prevent the parachute within from blossoming out further . " You 've got one in there , all right , " said Fabiola . " Beauty . You ought to see the crater . That 's the price we pay for civilization . " " Got what ? " Stem asked . " An ulcer . " " Oh , " said Stem . He was sorry he had let the doctor talk first ; it was as though if he had burst in immediately and told Fabiola what kind of a person he was , how nice and gentle , he might have been able to convince him that he was mistaken , that Stern was simply not the kind of fellow to have an ulcer . It was as though the doctor had a valise full of them , was dealing them out to certain kinds of people , and would revoke them if presented with sound reasons for doing so . Political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . Once , when Stern had been unable to get into college , his uncle had reached a Marinep80colonel named Treadwell , who had phoned the college and smoothed his admission . Stern felt now that if only Treadwell were to call the doctor , Fabiola would call back the ulcer and give it to someone more deserving . " Look , I do n't think I want to have one of them , " Stern said , getting a little dizzy , still feeling that it was all a matter of debate and that he was n't going to get his point across . " I 'm thirty-four . " When the doctor heard his age , he would see immediately that he had the wrong man and apologize for inconveniencing Stern . " That 's when they start showing up . Look , we do n't have to go in there if that 's what you 're worried about . We get at them other ways . " " What do you mean , go in there ? " said Stern . Going in there was different from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of men and equipment trooping into his stomach and staying there a long time . " You mean there was even a chance you might have had to go in ? " " I do n't see any reason to move in , " said Fabiola . The old doctor opened the door then and , with eyes narrowed , said , " I knew I heard some tootsies in here . " He limped in rakishly and took a seat next to Stern . " Excuse me , " he said , " I thought you were a tootsie . My office was always full of ' em . The real cheese , too . " " I think I may be pretty sick , " Stern said , and the old man rose and said , " Oh , excuse me . I 'll be getting along . Well , boys , keep everything hotcha . Any tootsies , you know who to call . " Hotcha , hotcha , " he said , and winked his way out the door . " Look , " Stern said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have one . " He felt suddenly that it was all a giant mistake , that somehow the doctor had gotten the impression he did n't mind having one , that it made no differencep81to Stem one way or the other . This was his last chance to explain that he really did n't want to have one . " I do n't see what 's troubling you , " said Fabiola . " You 'd think I 'd said heart or something . " " Maybe it 's the name , " Stern said . " I ca n't even get myself to say it . " It sounded to Stern like a mean little animal with a hairy face . See the coarse-tufted , angry little ulcer , children . You must learn to avoid him because of his vicious temper . He is not nice like our friend the squirrel . And here Stern had one running around inside him ... . " I can see all of this if I 'd said heart , " Fabiola said , beginning to write . " All right , we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving in . " " Do n't write , " said Stern , searching for some last-ditch argument that would force Fabiola to reconsider . The writing would make it final . If he could get Fabiola to hold off on that , perhaps a last-minute call from Colonel Treadwell would clear him . " I wear these tight pants , " Stem said . " Really tight . I think the homosexuals are influencing all the clothes we wear , and it 's silly , but I wear them anyway . I can hardly breathe , I wear them so tight . Do you think that might have done it ? " " No , " said Fabiola , filling up little pieces of paper with furious scribbles . " You 've definitely got one in there . " Once , on a scholarship exam , Stem had gotten stuck on the very first question . There were more than four hundredto go , but , instead of hurrying on to the next , he had continued for some reason to wrestle with the first , aware that time was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had felt a thickness start up in his throat and then had pitched forward on the floor , later to be revived in the girls ' bathroom , all chances of passing the exam up in smoke . The same thickness formed in his throat nowp82and he toppled forward into Fabiola 's carpeting , not quite losing consciousness . " I did n't say heart , " Fabiola said , leaning forward . " I could understand if I 'd said heart . " Helped to his feet , Stern felt better immediately . It was as though he had finally demonstrated how seriously he was opposed to having an ulcer . " I think we ought to bed this one down for a while , " the doctor said , writing again . " I know an inexpensive place . Can you get free ? " " Oh , Jesus , I 've really got one then , " said Stern , beginning to cry . " Ca n't you see that I do n't want one ? I 'm thirty-four . " Fabiola stood up and Stern looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trousers , and wondered how he was able to keep it free of coarse-tufted , sharp-toothed little ulcers . Fabiola 's belly had a stately , relaxed strength about it , and Stern wanted to hug it and tell the doctor about the kike man , how bad it was to drive past his house every night . Then perhaps the doctor would call the man , tell him the awful thing he 'd done and that he 'd better not do it any more . Or else Fabiola would ride out in a car and somehow , with the stately , dignified strength of his belly , bring the man to his knees . " It 's a little place upstate , " said Fabiola , leading Stern to the door . " The way you hit the floor I think we ought to bed it down awhile . They 'll be ready for you in about three days . " Stern wanted to protest . He wanted to say , " Wait a minute . You do n't understand . I really do n't want to have one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have one any more . " But the situation had become dreamlike , as though a man was coming for his throat with a razor and he was unable to cry out . " I just did n't want this , " he heard himself say sweetly.  |p83In  the corridor , the old doctor winked at Stern and said , " You boys have a couple of tootsies in there ? " " I 'm awfully sick , " Stern said , and went out the door . Crying in the street , Stern hailed a cab and gave the Negro driver , a scholarly-looking gentleman , his office address . " I 've just been told I 've got something lousy inside me , " Stem said , still crying . " Jesus , how I do n't want to have it in there . " " Cut him out , " the man said , shaking his head emphatically , as though he were crying " Amen " at a good sermon . " He an ulcer , cut him out an ' throw him ' pon the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' pon the floor , you see how he like that . I got an uncle , he cut one out , he live to be fifty-four . " Stem wanted to tell the man that fifty-four was no target to shoot for and that there 'd be no cutting , either . He wanted to say that he thought the man 's advice was terrible , but he was afraid the Negro , outwardly scholarly , had once fought as a welterweight and , irked , might quickly remove his horn-rims , back Stern against a fender , and cut him to ribbons with lethal combinations . When the cab pulled up , Stem said , " I might try cutting it out , " and tipped the scholarly Negro handsomely . At a drugstore counter near his office , Stern took a seat three stools down from the owner , Doroff the druggist , a loose and boneless man whose body seemed made of liquid and who appeared to be flowing rather than leaning against the counter . He was talking to a slender girl with long , impossibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her where she ate certain types of food . " Where do you gopher Chinese ? " Doroff asked , and when she answered , he made a negative , fishlike face and said , " Uh-uh , the only place to go in this city is a littlep84spot named Toy 's on Fifty-third . Where do you gopher French ? " He kept asking her the restaurant questions , and no matter what her answer , he would shake his head in fishlike disapproval and tell her the only good place to " gopher Indian " or to " gopher Italiano . " Each time he filled her in , she would spring back suddenly , as though kissed , crossing and uncrossing her legs with glee . Stern hated the fishlike Doroff for always having cute girls on stools beside him , girls who were much too appealing for the boneless druggist , and it broke Stern 's heart to see this one reacting to him with such delight . He had fears that one night the two of them would " gopher Spanish " or " gopher German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boneless Doroff would be floating up against her , getting to enjoy the length of her twisting legs . He wanted to say to her now , " What 's so great about him knowing restaurants ? Is that something to get excited about ? Yours are probably as good as his . You 'd never know it to look at me now , but if I were n't so upset , I could really tell you worthwhile things . I could tell you of Turgenev . " The man who had come for Stern 's order was a paunchy , gray-haired counterman who had the impression that Stern was in on things , had inside information on deals and intimate goings-on . He was always asking Stern questions impossible to answer , such as " So what 's going on ? " and " How 'd you make it today ? " No matter what Stern 's answer , he would wink deeply and shake with laughter . In sober moments , he would say to Stern , " I 'd like to get out of here . You hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He asked Stern now , " So how 'd the racket go ? " And when Stern said , " Usual , " he let out a hysterical bellow and said , " You really got something going , do n't you ? " He asked Stern then , " So what 'll it be ? "  |p85And  Stern , who felt he had a thousand pounds above his belt , said , " Milk . Warm it . I 've got something going on inside me . " One of Fabiola 's papers had said to drink milk , and Stern was anxious to get some down , picturing a warm flood of it streaming past his throat and pacifying temporarily a hairy , coarse-tufted angry little animal within him that squawked for nourishment . " No warm , " the man said . " You have to ask the boss . " Doroff had overheard the exchange . He had had fights with Stern 's boss , Belavista , down the street , and now he said , " All right on the warm . Is that what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of the plural form brought a flood of tears to Stern 's eyes . Ulcers . Fabiola had spoken of only one , and now he pictured a sea of them fanning out inside him . The girl giggled and Stern knew that he had lost all chances to get at her legs . He rose , his body hooked in a curve of pain , and whispered , " I 've only got one , " and then flew through the drugstore muttering , " Where do you gopher this , where do you gopher that . " He wanted to holler out " Where do you gopher shit ? " but he was certain Doroff would call out a number , sixty-two , and a drugstore plan would go into operation in which all eight countermen would loyally spring over the grill and trap Stern against the paperback books , hitting him in the stomach a few times and then holding him for a paid-off patrolman . Stern , who wrote the editorial material on product labels , traveled eight floors upward to his office now , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somber girl with gently rounded but sorrowful buttocks . She had lost both parents beneath a bus , and although she served Stern with loyalty , she placed a dark and downbeat cast upon all events.  | " I 've got something lousy in me and I 've got to go away , " Stern said . " Tell Mr. Belavista I want to see him . I 've got to get wound up here so I can get out . " " What is it ? " she asked . " The worst ? " " No , it 's not the worst , " Stem said . " But it 's lousy and I 'd rather not have it in there . " " Things like that take a long time to get cleared up , " she said . " All right , do you want the bad news now ? " " What do you mean , bad news ? " Stern asked . " All right , give it to me . " " The mail has n't come yet and you 've got someone who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it ? " Stern asked . " Yes , " she said . " That 's not so bad , " said Stern . " Why do you have to make everything sound so terrible ? " She walked away and Stem studied her buttocks , rising easily beneath her black skirt . On any other girl , they would have been appealing , but he could not detach them from what he knew about her and they seemed as a consequence downbeat and sorrowful ; touching them would have been reaching into a grave . Stern picked up the phone and the voice said , " Loudon here . I 've got something you 're going to want and I 'll only take a second . " " Something lousy happened to me , " said Stern , " and I 'm not doing any business . I just want to get wound up here a minute . " " I 'll just be a second . Here it is . Hamburg has become the wickedest city in the world . Each year thousands of tourists troop there to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who know every trick of the trade . Strippers along the Reeperbahn go further than in any city in the world and , if you know the right places to go , further . Outwardly having no bordellos , Hamburg actually hasp87many , and although its prosperous citizens pretend to have no knowledge of its wickedness , scratch the surface of any old-time Hamburgite and he 'll direct you to the door of an establishment where flourishes the oldest professionin the world . That 's about it . I go on from there detailing with anecdotes some of the more sordid practicesin this bawdy city , which has replaced Paris as Europe 's mecca of sin . What do you think ? " " What do you mean ? " Stern asked . " That 's it . I want to do an article of say six thousand words on it for you . I can have it ready in two weeks . " " I do labels , " Stern said . " For consumer products . " " You do n't think you can work it in ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stern said . " And I do n't feel good . " Stem chewed Fabiola 's stomach pills and waited for his only assistant , Glover , to end his phone conversation . A tall , yellow-haired man who frowned continually , as though the sun were in his eyes , Glover spent hours on the phone each day , exchanging anecdotes with an elaborate network of friends . Glover viewed all people and listened to all remarks with pursed lips and then assigned them a rating that seemed to have been arrived at by a Board of Good Taste , staffed by witty , wafer-thin , impeccably dressed men whose job it was to continually evaluate behavior . Glover was their branch representative in Stern 's office . When Stem commented on the summer heat , Glover would pause , purse his lips , and say , " You may not know it , but you 've just made one of the seven best weather remarks of the season . " His ratings were enervatingto Stern , as when he prefaced an item of gossip by saying , " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story . You 're one of them . " Stem wanted to tell him to spend less time on the phone , but he was afraid Glover , his body trim and supple from ballet exercises , would first fly at him in an effeminate rage andp88then pass along the episode to the Board , which would adjudge Stern " one of the three crudest men in America . " " I 've got to tell you the season 's funniest tapered slacks anecdote , " Glover said , entering Stern 's office . I 'm passing this on to only four friends of mine . " " I 'd like to listen , but I ca n't now , " Stern said , certain the Board would get immediate notification of his conduct . " I 've found out I 've got something in me and I 've got to go away for a while . " " Growing in you ? " Glover asked , slightly amused . Stern was aware that " one of the three funniest sickness descriptionsof the summer " was taking form . " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not sure what it 's doing . " Stern had the feeling that ulcers would be frowned upon by the Board as being dirty , Jewish , unsophisticated , only for fat people , and he was careful not to identify his condition . Only dueling scars and broken legs suffered while skiing would receive high grades . " Anyway , " Stern continued , " I want you to take over and keep the labels coming . " He turned his head away and said , " Long telephone calls are n't good . You might keep them short . " Glover 's face swiftly filled with color . He darted toward Stern 's desk with vicious ballet grace , shrieked , " I do my work , " and Stern , frightened , whispered , " Then make long ones , " and went past Glover 's coiled body to Belavista 's office . Waiting outside his boss 's suite , Stern felt a growing flatness and wondered suddenly whether Dr. Fabiola was n't perhaps deceiving him and planning to " go in " after all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he had worn a starched shirt and been brought in a taxi at dawn to have his tonsils removed . He had gonep89along sweetly and had not cried , feeling that something would come up , the hospital would be closed , or someone would discover his tonsils were really fine after all ; but when he arrived , serious men had undressed him and brought a giant cup down over his face while he struggledand clutched at the air . Stern imagined himself sleepingat Fabiola 's rest home and men stealing into his room at night with the same smothering cup . Stern looked in now at Belavista , a middle-aged man with giant feet and large , wood-chopping teeth . He was born in Brazil , and the natural charcoal of his face was reinforced by frequent visits to Rio de Janeiro . Belavista had $3,000,000 , and it was upsetting to Stern that there was no way to tell by looking at him that he had that much money . He might have been a man with $300,000 or even $27,500 , and Stern felt that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for people to tell this at a glance . A badge you got to wear or a special millionaire 's necktie . Stern felt that if you had that much money , you ought to fill up every minute with $3,000,000 things , ones you could n't do if you did n't have that much money . During conferences with Belavista , Stern found it unnerving to think that they were both spending minutes of life together in exactly the same way , despite the fact that his Latin boss had spectacular sums of money and Stern had only $800 . When Belavista ordered a rare tropical fruit salad for lunch , it depressed Stern . It would come from a fine restaurant and the fruit would be of gourmet succulence , and yet it was within the reach of people who had only $300 in the bank . Belavista was the only multimillionaire Stern had ever known , and in his presence Stern trembled with awe and barely heard his words , studying everything about him instead . He would look at his pants and think , " Oh , Jesus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet the fabric can be only so soft and fine . " When Belavistamade a vigorous motion or even walked about the room , it would occur to Stern that he was risking a heart attack and should , if possible , always sit in chairs and not move a muscle . And yet Stern had once seen Belavista race swiftly toward a train and dive between its doors , prying them open to get aboard . Stern decided that was really the difference , that was what had made him millions . And if people had all their money and possessions taken away and everyone had to begin all over , the men who plunged daringly toward closing train doors would survive and soon have fortunes again . Belavista was a gentle man , and Stern often told others , " He 's like a father to me . " Childless and divorced , Belavistalavished all his attentions on two six-year-old Braziliannieces , listing them both as corporation directors and sending them expensive gifts . A company joke was that for a Christmas present he had once given each of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which Belavista would put his arm around him and say that his nieces were foolish , that he had always wanted a son , and would Stem consider accepting a third of the label business , leading eventually to complete control ? And then Stern , all considerations of wealth aside , would have a father who leaped bravely for closing train doors . He went in to see Belavista now and yearned for the man to put his arms around him and take him back to his many-roomed house and keep him there , protecting him from the kike man and eventually calling for his wife and boy . " Something 's come up , " Stern said . " I 've got to go away . They found something inside me and I have to get it taken care of . " " I 'm sorry to hear that , " the Brazilian said . " What is it ? " " An ulcer , " Stern said . " It just showed up in there . " " Does it nag at you around here ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Stern said . " That 's where it gets you . " " Uh-huh , " said Belavista . " I know . I 've got it all right . " He hollered out to his secretary , " Make an appointment for me with Dr. Torro . " " I know , " said Belavista . " Gets you around the back , too , a little . " " A little , " Stern said . " You feel as though a baby with giant inflated cheeks is in there . " " I know , I know , " said the boss . " I 've got it . I 'm sure I 've got the same thing . " He shouted to his secretary , " Make sure it 's for today , " and then said to Stern , " I 've got it , all right . I 've got the same thing . " Stern felt a tiny bit of resentment now . It was as though he had finally come up with something that Belavista , with all his millions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to horn in on Stern and get one too , a finer and richer one . Now Belavista rose and said , " All right , here 's what I 'm going to do for you , " and Stern felt such a thrill of excitement that he had to hold on to his boss 's desk . There were those who said that Belavista was a selfish and shrewd man , but Stern had always told them , " I do n't see it . He comes through . He 's always been very nice to me . " Stern was certain Belavista had been waiting for a moment of crisis , a special time to make certain announcementsabout Stern 's future . And now Stern , near tears , wanted to hug him in advance and say , " Thank you . Oh , thank you . " " I 'm continuing your salary , " Belavista said . " That 's wonderful , " said Stern . " It will ease my mind . " And then he waited for the list to continue.  | " For as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's three weeks . " " That 's really nice , " Stern said . He looked with humility at the floor , as though he expected nothing more . " You 've been pretty good around here and I want to play fair with you , " said Belavista . " I 've thought it over , and that 's the way I 'm going to handle it . I 'd like to chat some more , but I 've got an appointment I ca n't break . So look , take it easy , get your mind off things , and everythingaround here will be all right . " " It 's amazing the way something like this just happens to you , " Stern said . " That 's right , " Belavista said , tapping his foot , and Stern , aware that he was keeping him from doing milliondollarthings , said , " I 'll be rolling along now . " " OK , guy , " said Belavista , and Stern left his office , the parachute blowing up big and painful inside him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Stern for being from Brooklyn , Stern , whose father had made a little extra money at that time , enough to buy a car , had said , " My father can buy and sell you , " to the boy . Now , hating his boss , he wanted to say to him , " My father can buy and sell you . " If Belavista then pinned him down on the actual worth of his father , Stern would be vague and say , " He made a lot of money in the shoulder pad business . " It was late in the afternoon when Stern got back to his desk , an unsettling and nauseating time ; each day at this time Stern would have to face going home and , at the end of his trip , driving past the kike man 's house . He would do things , try to distract himself , talk to people and force jokes , but no matter what he did , he would eventually have to leave the safety of his office , where even Glover 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and ride home to the kike man . Each night he would buy his newspaper at the station , sit among groups of hearty men , and when one named " Ole Charlie " told ap93drainpipe anecdote , Stern would raise his head and guffaw at the punch line as though he understood , that he was riding home to a faulty drainpipe too , and that bad drainagewas his major concern in life also . And then Stern would bury his head in his newspaper and turn to an importantsection , like maritime shipping , and look very serious , making an almost physical effort to blend in with the men alongside him , as though if he looked exactly like them , he would become exactly like them , speeding home to drainpipes and suburban pleasures . But then , as his stop grew nearer , a panic would start in his throat . The maritime section would become a blur and he would think how nice it would be to go one stop too far on the railroad and get off in a new place , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American chairs , a wife educatedat European schools , neighbors named " Ole Charlie , " and a street devoid of kike men . At his desk now , Stern thought that perhaps tonight he would send his wife to tell the kike man to stop everything , to stop tormenting him , because Stern now had an ulcer . He was not ever to hit Stern in the stomach and do anything to his family , because you do n't do those things to a man if he 's got an ulcer . Not if you wear veteran jackets and fly flags from every window . You 're a man of fair play . Stern imagined the man hearing the ulcer news and muttering something , perhaps snickering wetly ; but he would never fling Stem 's wife down again and peer between her legs . You do n't do that to a man 's wife if he has an ulcer blooming in his belly and you 're supposed to be American and fair . Stern thought how much better it would be if he had lost a leg or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything to him again . If he were blind , that would be complete protection for Stern 's wife and child . At a meeting , the man might tell with a giggle of the blind Jew in the neighborhood , but it wouldp94be hands off Stern 's wife and child . Perhaps , though , Stem had it all wrong . Perhaps the man 's commando training would prevail . Never give up an advantage . If you blind a man , but there is still life inside him , jump on him and snuff it out . And Stern imagined himself tapping sightlesslypast the man 's house , his wife and child flanking him . The man would spot them , walk slowly forward , then gather some speed , put Stern out of commission with a judo chop , kick his child in the crotch , and then get his wife down to stab her sexually , and , worse , get her to wriggle and whimper with enjoyment beneath her conquerorwhile Stern thrashed blindly in the street . Stern sipped milk now , got his desk in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ center of his desk so that others would find it the following day and be consumed with heartbreak at the tragic symbol . At his desk , Glover spoke with pursed lips to the Board , and Stern imagined suddenly with fright that the moment he left for Fabiola 's rest home , Glover would resign from the Board , renounce all effeminate mannerisms , marry immediately , and move into a split-level , thereby becoming attractive to Belavista . When Stern returned , his ulcer vanquished , Glover would be sitting at Stern 's desk . Stern 's one Negro friend , Battleby the artist , came in then with sketches for Stern 's labels and began immediately to fill Stern in on all his latest activities . A bearded Negro intellectual , he behaved as though his paintings were the major concern of all Americans and people walked the streets in a sweat , chafing to get late details on his career . When someone else in a room was speaking , Battleby felt threatened and would sweat and fidget , tugging at his collar and gulping deeply for air until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , " They have some pen-and-inks of mine over at thep95West Side Gallery , and a Guggenheim director said I 'm one of the eight best young Americans in casein . " Battleby sat down now and said to Stern , " Here are the sketches . I 'm doing something new with ceramics that an art editor has said promises to be one of the real technical contributions to the art world . You know my far-out comic strip ? Well , the syndicate says if I can sharpen the punch line just a little , I have a good chance of selling it to them . The nudes are going quite well . I can sell almost as many as I like . I may teach a course this summer at Polytech in techniques of the French moderns . " For a moment Battleby seemed to forget his next achievement , and when Stern leaned forward to say something , a panic flew into Battleby 's eyes and he began to fidget and sweat and tap his feet until he remembered and choked out the next line . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with twenty-six canvases by September , there 's a gallery on Madison that wants me . They once had an original Braque . " He plunged on in this style , and in a way Stern wanted him to continue all night , because he knew that when Battleby stopped , he would have to put on his jacket and go to the train . He wanted , though , to stop Battleby and talk to him about the kike man , but he was afraid to cut him off for fear of being thought anti-Negro . Because he was so embarrassed about his cowardice , he never really talked to anyone about the man down the street , and Battleby seemed a good person to talk to . Who could he repeat it to ? A bunch of people up in Harlem ? As Battleby went on about his achievements and the people who thought his work was fine , Stern wondered if he could get Battleby to stop being an intellectual for a second and tell Stern some special Negro things about kicking prejudiced people in the guts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought that Battleby used too many browns , tossingp96them in inappropriately for ocean scenes , and that the paintings , if inhaled , would even smell a little Negro . He had a strong interest in Battleby 's work , and yet another of his reasons for having Battleby as a friend was that down deep he felt he could count on the Negro to hide him from the police in a teeming Harlem flat if ever he were to kill someone . He hoped , too , though he could never suggest this , that Battleby would one night furnish him with supple-bodied Negro girls of Olympian sexual skills who would scream with abandon when Stern bit them gently . And now , as Battleby droned on , he even dared to hope that when he told Battleby of his predicament , the Negro would fling off his horn-rims and fill an open-cab truck with twenty bat-carrying Negro middleweights , bare to the waist and glistening with perfect musculature . Then Battleby would drive them at great speed to Stern 's town to do a job on the man down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's house swiftly and letting him have it about the head . The next time Battleby paused for breath , Stern said , " I do n't feel so good . I 've got to go away for a while . Look , we never talk , but I 've got to talk to someone . Something happened to me out where I live . A guy did this to me because I 'm Jewish . You probably run into a lot of Negro things . We never talked about stuff like this before , but I thought we could now . " Battleby fidgeted on his chair and gulped for air , blinking at Stern incredulously , as if to say , " You do n't understand . The conversation is about me . I talk about things that have happened to me , and I do n't get into other things . " Battleby said : " I 've got some crucifixion oils I 'd lovefor you to see . Real giant things with a powerful religiousquality . I do n't see how I was able to come up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Stern said . " I have to talk to someone.  |p97What  happened is that this guy got my wife down and looked inside her legs and she was n't wearing anything . This is no fun for me to say , believe me . Then he said kike at her , and the worst thing is I never did anything about it . My kid was standing there . I walked over , but I did n't do anything , and now I 'm sick and have to take off for a while . You probably run into a lot of Negro things like that . " A change seemed to come over Battleby now . It was as though he 'd been hoping Stern would never get into personalaffairs , but now that he had , he was n't going to let his old friend down . He took off his glasses , wiped them , and began to gulp and shake his head , as though what he were about to say was so true and real he could hardly get it out . Then , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire race of long-suffering Negroes , he said , " You have got to abstract yourself so that you present a faceless picture to society . " We all do , " said Battleby , shaking his head and replacinghis horn-rims . " Every one of us do . " Stern , puzzled , but afraid that if he asked for elaboration , Battleby would find him anti-Negro , said , " All right . I 'm going to start doing that thing right away . " " Good , " said Battleby , rising to leave . " I 'll call you as various things on me come up . " And Stern , heartsick that he had not asked about the truckload of middleweights , watched the heavy-necked Negro intellectual fly down the hall . Talking to Battleby , Stern had not thought about his stomach , but now he touched it tentatively and a cloudburstof pain washed upward from his feet and filled his ribs . It was as though a sleeping ulcer had been annoyed and now waited within him , angry , red-eyed , and vengeance-seeking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mass of terribleness could be cleared up without " goingp98in , " and Stern was certain Fabiola was wrong after all . He imagined a scene in which a thin-lipped gentile surgeonwould deftly slice down several layers inside him and then , after furtively looking about to see that no one was watching , reach in and pluck out fistfuls of things Stern vitally needed . The gentile would then sew him up , leaving Stern four more years of life , in order to avert suspicion . He finished a container of milk , leaving it slightly crushed and forlorn in the center of his desk , and then walked slowly to the train station , stalling , hoping that something would happen , a minor car accident perhaps , that would eliminate his having to go past the kike man 's house . Girls streamed by in the street with lovely unsettlingbodies , and Stern imagined the eyes of a good one suddenly meeting his with instant understanding , the two of them going silently to her room to make love , and Stern , by the sheer violence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stomach , out along his organ , and into her belly , where the girl would somehow accept it with more strength than he had been able to . On the station platform , Stern stood next to two tall , starched , elderly men , both of whom looked like entire organizations in themselves . First one , then the other would make a hearty , obvious observation about the train system , delivered in a deep , resonant , corporational voice , and then both would chuckle with warm , folksy helplessnessat the remark . When the train pulled in , leaving the car door a few feet from where they stood , one said , " Looks like that engineer went and missed us again , " and the other jabbed him in the ribs and said , " He sure did , " and then both laughed with heartiness . The first one said , " Guess we better get our seats before they 're all gone , " and the second said , " Else maybe they 'll raise the price now , " and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took seats behind Stern , and one said , " Sure gon na miss these old rides when I take m'vacation . " The other said , " Gon na have yourself a little fun , are ya ' ? " He dug the first in the ribs , and then both slapped their knees . The train was late getting started , and Stern thought he would join in and try one of their obvious remarks . He wheeled around and said , " Looks like we 'll never get out of here . " The pair looked at him with hostility . After the train started , the men began to read newspapers , one of them holding his in such a way that the edge of it cut into Stern 's neck , chafing it as he turned the pages . Stern wanted to turn around and ask the man to hold it another way , but he was sure the man would rise and make a speech to the other passengers about Stern , unveiling him as a Jewish newcomer to the train , editor of sin-town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting laughs from some obvious but folksy remarks , and then deliver his denunciatory speech with confidence and authority , as though he were speaking to a board . He would then turn the floor over to Stern , who would begin a sophisticated anecdote , get confused , and finally slink down wordlessly in his seat , the sin-town editing charge unrefuted , while other gentiles in their seats applauded derisively and shouted , " Hear , hear ; fine speech . " He made irritated shrugs with his neck , hoping the man would get the idea , but the paper edge remained against his neck . Stern finally wheeled around , but when his eyes caught the other man 's unblinking gaze , he looked upward , as though his intention had been to examine the car ceiling . A conductor around the same age as the two men came and stood next to them , swaying in the aisle , and one of them said to the other , " He 's sure got the racket , do n't he ? " The second one howled and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his pocket for you if you ask him , " and thenp100both rocked with laughter as the conductor shook his head in mock exasperation and said , " You guys are great kidders . " It was stuffy in the train , and Stern could not get his window open . He opened his belt all the way , as though to give the ulcer more room and comfort , but it seemed to swell and spread out , as though it would occupy any amount of space it was given . Stern felt uncomfortable and remembered suddenly that Fabiola had told him always to be on the lookout for a black coffee-grounds substance if he should have occasion to vomit . This thought , combined with the stuffiness and the paper in his neck , nauseated him ; he was hemmed in by a small lady who glittered blindingly with jeweled ornaments . " I think I 've got to get out of here and vomit , " he said to her , getting up and making his way past her knees . " Why did n't you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in annoyance . " You 're halfway there . " " Stern got out into the aisle and asked the conductor , " Which way to vomit ? " The conductor considered the question a long time , then shook his head and began to walk to one end of the car . The two men stuck their heads in their newspapers , as though Stern had violated his twentieth rule since the trip began and was past all comment . He followed the conductor to the platform between cars . The conductor pointed to a corner of the tiny platform and said , " Vomiting'sdone in there on newspapers . I 'll get passengers out the other way . " " Can I begin now ? " Stern asked , not wishing to violate any vomiting protocol . Without answering , the conductorwalked back into the car . Stern realized he had no paper and returned to the smoker , where he asked a man for some . " I 'm not feeling so hot , " he said , and the man said , " All righty , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stern spread it out in the corner of the betweencarsplatform and tried to vomit neatly and with as little fuss as possible . It occurred to him before he started that perhaps he might vomit forth the ulcer and then kick it off the platform , rid of it forever , but then he went ahead , and when he was finished , his stomach remained bloated with pain . He searched the floor now , looking for coffee grounds , but there was no trace of any , and in a sense he felt a little disappointed . He remained on the platform with the newspapers , guarding the area , as though to prove he did n't want to evade responsibility . He remained crouched next to the newspaper , and he wondered what happened to people who died on the between-cars area . Did they have a special procedure for getting them off the train ? Were they taken off on stretchers , keeping up the ruse that they were still alive , or were they simply carried off in special body bundles ? When the train stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other exit and then came back to Stern . " I guess you can go now , " he said . " Try and do this before starting out or after getting there . " " All right , " Stern said , and walked off the train , relieved that he did not have to go through a special trial for vomitersand that he was still allowed to use the train . The sun was going down as Stern got into his car , and he wished now that there was some way to let the kike man know that this was a day in which he had just vomitedand had gotten official confirmation of his ulcer and that , just for this one day , it was all to stop . He was to stop hating Stern and Stern was to be allowed to just put the man out of his mind . He was to be allowed to ride home just like any other man coming home to his family . In a way , though , the ulcer that raged within him and the train vomiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courage . He drove toward the man 's house with the feeling that he had been given the ulcer and had vomited in humiliation on a train and now there was little else that could happen to him . Once , when Stern was young , his mother had bought a corduroy jacket for his birthday and he had worn it in the street . The orphan boy , who had tormented and bullied him for months , swept down suddenly and tore the jacket from Stern 's body , slippinginto it himself and then dancing around in it tantalizingly , beyond Stern 's reach . A coldness had come over Stern and he had advanced toward the boy with poise and self-control and said , " Give me that jacket . " The onlookers had said , " Are you crazy ? He 'll crack your head . " But the orphan boy , startled by Stern 's show of resistance , had taken off the jacket and said , " Here . Ca n't you take a joke ? " And Stern had put the jacket back on and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bigger and stronger boy tormented and bullied him , knocking him against buildings , blackening his eyes , picking him up , and slamming him to the ground . Now , as he drove past the man 's house , the feeling of control returned for an instantand he slowed down . He thought that he would walk into the man 's house , take off his coat , and say , " Just wear this coat . I dare you to wear it . My mother bought it for me . " And then , if the man put on the coat , Stern would somehow be able to crush him with a blow , battering his head through his living-room window . But then Stern thought , " What if he declines to wear the coat , grins wetly , and simply drives his fist into my ulcer-swollen belly , actually breaking open a hole in it ? " And so Stern drove past the man 's house , his hands shaking at the wheel . Outside his house , with the dark coming on fast , Stern walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crying through his nose . He did this for a long time ,  |p103and  he was not without the thought that perhaps it would help ; he would be heard , someone would be touched , and when he dried his eyes , there would be no ulcer . His wife had gone for the day , leaving the child in the care of a baby-sitter , and when Stern paid her and sent her away , he saw that his parents had driven out unexpectedly . Stern 's father was a small , meticulously dressed man whose years of cutting shoulder pads had made him terriblyprecise about details . Whenever Stern , as a boy , began the new side of a quarter-pound stick of butter that had been started on the other side , his father would slap his hand and say , " That 's no way to do it . I ca n't understand you . " He spent a great deal of time after meals scooping up bread crumbs with a precise rolling motion of the knife , not stopping until he had gotten every last crumb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he passed a mirror he would draw back his lips and try severalvarieties of smiles , practicing broad ones and quick , spontaneous grins . He had a special thin , six-note whistle , which Stem as a boy had always listened for late at night ; it meant he was home , and Stern would watch him from the window , a small man , walking jauntily , on his way to the three-room apartment to practice a few quick grins before the mirror and then sit down to eat a meal with factorylike precision . Stern had not fancied the idea of having a small father , but one day he had seen this compactlybuilt man point his nose up at a towering motormanon a crowded subway train and say , " Ah , button up or I 'll dump you on your ass . " The nose he had thrust up in the motorman 's face had a jagged scar along its bridge which fascinated Stern . Whenever his father practiced grins , he would also check the scar , stretching it for ap104good look . Stern liked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gently , as though it still might hurt . One day his father told Stern the scar had been given to him by two soccer players in a strange neighborhood who had suddenlylashed out and knocked him unconscious . The friends of Stern 's father had gone looking for the men with steel piping but never found them . Stern liked that story and told it to people all the time , enjoying it when he could say , " My father 's friends went looking for the guys with pipes . " Stern wished he had friends who would do that for him . When Stern 's father had failed to inherit the shoulder pad business from his brother Henny , he had simply continued on as a shoulder pad cutter , smiling surreptitiously into mirrors , and seemed not to have realized that his whole life had gone down the drain . He did describe his brother Henny 's death often , however , acting it out in vigorous pantomime . " They just found him sitting in a chair , " he would tell the listener , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knees bend a little , his arms sag at his sides , and pop his eyes , letting his tongue hang grotesquely from his mouth . When the business dream had faded , however , Stern 's mother had never recovered . It meant she could never own a home in Saint Petersburg and decorate it in Chinesemodern . She had been a tall , voluptuous woman with much nerve . When Stern was young , she would just hail cars on the street instead of cabs , and then she and Stern would jump into them that way with whoever was driving . In restaurants she would grab celebrities and hold them by the sleeve , hollering across to the embarrassed young Stern , " I 've got Milton Berle " or " I just grabbed Bob Eberle . " After the business debacle , she aged swiftly and began to drink . She tried furiously to cling to her youth and did little dance steps all the time , humming top105herself and executing them in subways , in bars , on the street . When she was with Stern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strange young man and say , " He 's for me " or " I could make him in ten seconds . " Stern would answer , " I do n't get any kick out of hearing things like that . " The phrase " make " sickened him . He did n't want to know about his dated mother , with her slack , antique thighs and dyed hair , doing oldfashionedthings with strange , dull men . They waited in the house for him on this day , Stern 's father in a slipover sweater , his mother in toreador pants , and they had brought along Stern 's Uncle Babe , a thin man with giant Adam 's apple who had spent much of his life in mental institutions . Married to a concert violinist and thought to be of modest circumstances , he had attended a recital one evening and run amok , certain there were poison gases in the air . When police subdued him , he was found to be carrying bankbooks showing balances of a million dollars . Stern had childhood memories of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pralines , his favorites , and then seeing Uncle Babe led out in institution clothes , which were always too large . Stern would sit and smile at his uncle on a bench , and then , on the way home , his mother would say , " He has some head . As sick as he is , he can tell you smarter things than people on the outside . " Now , Stern 's mother led forth Uncle Babe and said to Stern , " Look who I brought out for you . Uncle Babe . You always loved him . " Stern hugged Uncle Babe with great tenderness , as though to make up for all the wrongs done to him by heartless institutions , and Stern 's mother said , " Get him to tell you about the market . To this very day , he has some head . " Stern sat alongside his Uncle Babe and thep106conversation took the usual course . Uncle Babe would make a few statements about the financial world , too generalized to be put to any moneymaking use , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting a decent piece of fish , various smells in the air , and how certain shirt fabrics itched your skin . " He has some head if you can only keep him on the right track , " said Stern 's mother . After a while , Stern arose and said , " I ca n't listen to anybody any more . I 've come home today with an ulcer . " Stem 's mother said , " I do n't believe it . " Stern said , " I 've got one , all right . With a large crater . In two days I have to go to a rest place for it . It hurts right now . " " That 's what I needed , " Stern 's mother said , puffing at a cigarette . " I do n't have enough . That 's the perfect extra thing I need to carry . " Stem 's father , standing small and round-shouldered , shook his head gravely and said , " You 've got to take care of yourself . That 's what happens . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Uncle Babe leaned forward , staring widely , and said , " I like a piece of fish on a night like this , but I do n't like the way it smells . " " I 'm going to have a drink , " said Stern 's mother . " And I do n't need any comments either . Do you know where I 'd be if I was n't able to take a little drink ? " She swallowedsome Scotch from a shot glass and said , " I do n't have any reason to drink , do I ? No reason in the world . " " Maybe I 'll just go upstairs and lie down , " Stern said . " It hurts plenty inside me . " " I 'm not going to worry about it , " Stem 's mother said . " I ca n't kill myself . I 've had disappointments in my life , too . Plenty of them . I could tell you plenty . "  | " I am not interested in people 's disappointments , " Stern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All right , so I said something wrong , " she said . " Look , darling , stay downstairs awhile . Maybe it 'll make you feel better . Talk to your Uncle Babe . You love him . You know his head . " Maybe we could all use a little music in our systems , " she said , instructing Stern 's father to bring in a small accordion he carried in the trunk of his car . As a boy , Stern had sung at home to his father 's accordion playing . His voice was not bad , and his mother had once taken him to a talent agent , who 'd had Stem sing into his ear and then rejected him for poor head tones . But Stem 's mother was rhapsodic over his voice , and now , as Stem 's father played some warm-up trills , she sank into a chair and said , " Sing for me , darling . It 'll make us all feel better . " I 'm not singing anything , " Stem said . " All right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uncle Babe , " she said . " He 's never heard your voice , and he 's come all the way out here . He 'll faint when he hears you . " " Jesus , " Stern said . " I 'm thirty-four . " But when his father played an old ballad , he began to come in with the words . " That voice , " his mother said . " The same voice . I could die . " When he reached the bridge of the song , Stern said , " I 'm not doing any more of this . I told you about my stomach . Does n't anybody realize my stomach hurts ? I 've got a goddamned ulcer . I have to go away to a home . " " Do n't sing , " said Stern 's mother . " What am I going to do  --  put a bullet through my head ? I only had an idea . I thought it would be good for everybody . " Stem 's father continued through the song , as though respecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all numbers are to be completed . Uncle Babe leaned across to Stern 's mother and said , " Listen , did you take a look at my shirt ? I do n't like the feel of it . It does n't feel good on my skin . " " The crazy bastard does n't even hear the music , " said Stern 's mother . " He 's in a world of his own . " Stern 's father wound up the ballad with an elaborate trilling effect , and then Stem 's mother said , " Is n't your wife home when you have an ulcer ? " " She does n't know about it yet , " said Stern . " She ought to be home if you 're not feeling well , " said Stern 's father . " I said she does n't know . Listen , none of this is doing me any good . I 'm going upstairs on the bed . I 'm going to a home in a few days , and I 've got to stay quiet until then . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and when his stomach touched the bed , it seemed to puff up with pain like great baby cheeks and he had to roll over on his back to be comfortable . A car moved into the driveway and he went to the window and saw his wife hop out , come around and kiss a man through the driver 's window , and then run into the house . Stern got back into bed . She was downstairs for a while , and then she ran up the steps and knelt beside him and said , " What happened ? " " I 've come up with an ulcer and there 'll be some kind of institution in a few days . " " Oh , that 's not so bad , " she said , her great eyes wide , kissing his wrist . " You 'll fix it right up in a few days . " " No , I wo n't , " said Stern . " It 's a big thing and it 'll be in there for a while . I may have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearing a tight jumper that hugged her flaring thighs snugly ; the crease of her underwear showedthrough , and Stern had a sudden fear that she had just thrown on her clothes in a great hurry . " Where were you ? " he asked . " I thought you do n't go anywhere out here . " " I went to a modern dance class today for the first time , " she said , her eyes shimmering with warmth . " I thought it would give me an interest . " " But I 've come home with an ulcer , " Stern said . " I did n't know that , " she said . " Who was the one in the car ? " " Jose , " she said . " The instructor . He picks up the studentsand takes them home . " " I saw a kiss , " said Stern , a slow and deadly beat beginningagainst his stomach walls , as though fists inside him were pleading for attention . " Oh , that 's just a thing he does , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw tongues , " said Stern . " No , you did n't , " she said . " I ca n't help what he did . I did n't use my tongue . " " Oh my God , then there was a tongue . " Stern 's mother and father came up to the room , followed by Uncle Babe . All three stood in the doorway . " That 's some place for a wife to be when there 's a sickness , " said Stern 's mother . " Out of the house . " She downed a shot of Scotch and said , " And they wonder why I take a little drink . " " I 'll be where I want , " Stern 's wife said , and his small father came forth , shoved his nose into her face , and said , " You 'll be home with him . " Uncle Babe came into the room , eyes wide in the pale glare of the single bedroom lamp , and said , " I smell gas ; open the window , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thin and unshaven , sitting in oversized clothes on the bench of one of Uncle Babe 's institutions , waiting forp110his son and wife to visit him , the boy carrying a box of pralines for him , his favorites . The fists within him stepped up the rhythm of their beat , and Stern began to roll from one side of the bed to the other , hands tight around his stomach , as though to keep it from falling apart . " Call Fabiola , " he said in a whisper . " Tell him no two days . I 've got to go tonight . Oh , please , tell him I 've got to get started tonight . " Fabiola told Stern of pills that would take him through the night and said he would arrange space at the home for the following morning . Stern awakened blinking to an agonizingly warm and lovely summer day . But the summerfragrance unsettled him ; on such days his son would have to stand without playmates , sucking a blanket on a barren lawn , and Stern would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man a mile down the road . Dark and dreary weather made Stern rejoice , because on such days there was no shame in staying inside the house , where it was safe . Down deep at the center of him there was a small capsule of glee that he was going to the home on this day ; if dark and terrible things happened then to his family , he could not be held responsible . How could he prevent them if he was away in a home ? The midnight driveway kiss nagged at him now , and he reached for his wife as though to nail her down , to stake a claim in her during his absence , to mark her , change her in some way so there would be no smoothly coordinatedbackseat tumbles with Jose during his absence . She watched him like a great-eyed fourth-grade girl , but then her eyes closed , her skin became cold , and she clung to him with a nervous , clattering whimper , doing a private , rising-up kind of thing . He went at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his connection he could dop111something to her that would keep her quiet and safe and chaste for two weeks , but when he fell to the side he saw with panic that she was unchanged , unmarked , her skin still cold and unrelieved . " Can you be a man again , my darling ? " " No , " Stern said . " I 've got something inside me . I 've got to get up to that home . Listen , can you give up that ballet thing when I 'm away ? " " No , I do n't want to . It 's the first thing I 've had . " " OK , then , " he said . " But no more tongues . Ca n't you drive home by yourself ? " " He drives the students home . The kissing is just a show-biz thing . Ca n't you be a man one more time ? I 'm going to have to jump on a telephone pole . " " I do n't want you to say things like that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it occurred to Stern that he had never seen his house during the week at this precise time of day . It was eleven in the morning , a time when he was usually at work for two hours . He had gone to work on schedule for many years , and in his mind he had felt that if he ever stopped and stayed home one day , or left his job entirely , he would die . And yet here he was , standing on the lawn , looking at his home , and he was perfectly alive . Perhaps that was it , he thought ; perhaps all he had to do was to stop work for one day and see that he could live and he would not have gotten the ulcer . His son came out and said , " How long will you be away ? " " A little while , " Stern said . " I ca n't wait for a little while , " the boy said . " I 'll be back soon . " " I ca n't wait till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Where ? " Stern said.  | " In God 's hand ; right on his pinkie , as a matter of fact . " " Who teaches him God things ? " Stern said to his wife . " The baby-sitter . She 's inside . " Stern said , " She should n't . " He wanted to go inside and tell her to discontinue the God information , but he was afraid she would come after him one night with a torchbearingarmy of gentiles and tie him in a church . Stern 's wife drove the car , and as they passed the man 's house down the street Stern ducked down and made himselfinvisible , as though he did not want the man to know of his triumph . Stern was certain that if the man knew he had put Stern in a home , he would fly a dozen flags thrillingly from every window . On the highway , Stern watched his wife 's knees , apart as they worked the pedals ; he imagined her dropping him off at the home , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make love to her while her feet kept working the pedals so that she could always say that she had driven all the way home without stopping . She pulled into the driveway of the Grove Rest Home in the late afternoon and Stern , saying goodbye , squeezed her flesh and kissed her through her dress , as though by getting in these last touches he could somehow ward off the gas station attendant.  |p115A  giant picture of a somber , bewhiskered , **25;3680;TOOLONG hung in the reception lobby . Stern took this to be Grove himself . The lobby was a great , darkened , drafty place , and as Stern passed the picture he instinctivelyducked down a little , certain that Grove , in setting up the home , had no idea people such as Stern would be applying for admission . As Stern stood before the receptiondesk he expected an entourage of Grove 's descendantsto run out with clenched fists and veto him . A tiny , gray-haired nurse looked up at him and said , " What can I do for you , puddin' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course , dumplin ' , " she said , checking her records . " You 're the new intestinal . I 'll get Lennie out for you . Does it hurt much ? " Stern said he 'd had a bad night and asked what the rate was . She said three dollars a day . " That includes your three meals and your evening milk and cookie . " Stern had been ready to pay ten dollars a day and feltp116ashamed at getting it for so little . She said , " Everyone pays the same rate , crumb bun , " and Stern said , " I 'll donatea couch later when I get out . " A tall , handsome Negro with powerful jaw muscles came out on steel crutches , moving slowly , adjusting clamps and gears as he clattered forward . He was pushinga baggage cart , and he threw his legs out one at a time behind it , as though he were casting them for fish . " This is Lennie , " said the nurse . " You 'll like him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stern , your new intes-tinal . " " Very good , " said the Negro . " Bags on the cart , Mr. Stern . Patients to the left of me as we walk . " " I can handle them , " said Stern . The Negro 's jaw muscles bunched up , and he said , " Patients to my left . Bags on the cart . " Stern , afraid of his great jaw muscles , tossed his bags on the cart , and the Negro began to clatter forward , clamps and gears turning , leg sections rasping and grinding out to the side , one at a time . Stern fell in beside him , hands in his pockets , feigning a very slow walk , as though he , too , took days to get places . " Are you originally from New York ? " Stern asked . " I just came from there and it 's funny , but the last guy I saw was a Negro artist friend of mine . " " There 'll be no dinner , " said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cart , looking straight ahead . " That 's at five . You 're late for milk and cookie , too . One lateness is allowed on that , though . Did the nurse furnish you with milk and cookie ? " " No , " said Stern . The Negro 's jaw muscles tightened again , and he glared violently at Stern . He released the cart , turned around after much shifting and switching of gears , andbegan to make his way back to the nurse . Stern walked several steps behind him . When the Negro got back to the reception desk , he asked the nurse , " Did you give this intestinal milk and cookie ? " " No , I did n't , old stocking , " said the nurse . " That 's what he claim , " said the Negro , freezing Stem with another glare . Once again he shifted gears , arranged clamps , tugged and yanked at elaborate mechanisms , and finally turned and walked complicatedly down a dark ramplike hall , Stern falling in beside him . The darkness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the distance were the blinking lights of a building that seemed to be set off by itself , deliberately isolated . Crowd sounds were coming from it , as though from a bleachers group that had remained long after a ball game . " Is that where we 're going ? " Stern asked the Negro . " You 're not to go there , " he said . " That 's Rosenkranz , where mentals are to be taken . And you 're not to be socialwith attendants at Grove , such as myself . " He looked straight ahead as he took his zigzagging , clanking , spastic steps , and Stern was somehow convinced that this man was doing the most important work in the world . That there was nothing of greater moment than being the attendant for intestinals and being in charge of baggage carriers . Despite his complicated legs , he seemed a terribly strong man to Stern , who felt that even were he to flee to the Netherlands after a milk and cookie infraction , getting a fifteen-hour start , the Negro would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondered if somehow he might not be able to enlist the Negro and his great jaw muscles to fight the man down the street . He saw the man knocking the Negro down seven or eight times and the Negro disgustedly wiping off his clean intern 's jacket , making clamp andp118gear adjustments , and then , handsome face serious and determined , great jaw muscles bunched , coming on to squeeze the life out of the kike man 's throat . They came finally to the end of the ramp and to a twostorydormitory , which Lennie identified as Griggs . He pointed to a room right inside the entrance and said , " One is not ever to enter the staff room . There is to be a line outside for medicines and , later , for milk and cookie . There 'll be no leaving the grounds either ; otherwise , strict penaltieswill ensue . " Stern 's room was on the second floor . It took double the usual number of gear shiftings and fastener slidings for the Negro to mount the stairs , and when he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white intern 's jacket was soaked . Stern said , " Thank you for all your trouble , " and the Negro , after opening the room door , said , " One is to obey all rules here on the premises . " Stern 's room was long and thin and rancid , as though aging merchant marine bosuns with kidney difficulties had spent their lives in it . A small middle-aged man with a caved-in chest and loose pouches under his eyes sat on one of the two beds in the dim light and said , " Hey , what 's this ? " " What ? " asked Stern . The man had arranged his hands in a tangled way , as though he were scrubbing them , and was holding them against a lamp so that a clumping , knobby shadow showed against the wall . " I do n't know what that is , " Stern said . " See the dingus ? See the wang-wang ? " " What do you mean ? " Stern asked . " You know . It 's sexeroo . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as the man manipulated his fingers , Stern thought he could make out a rough picture of a pair of sexual organs in contact.  | " That 's pretty good , " Stem said . " Check these , " the man said , pulling a medallion out of his T-shirt and beckoning Stern closer . Stern looked at it , a carving of a lion and a deer , which turned into a pair of male and female genitals when tilted at an angle . " See the dingus ? Can you see the wang-wang ? You want to hold it and fool around with it awhile ? " Stern actually wanted to get a better look at it , but he said , " No , thanks . I 'm just getting in here and I want to take it easy . I 'm going to just lie down and not do anything for a while . " " I got that last set from a guy carved them in prison . Listen , do you want me to do another one on the wall ? I can do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , " said Stem , " and take it easy the first night . I have some things on my mind . " Stern got down on the bed and thought again about the man down the street . He imagined coming home and finding out that the man had moved away , unable to make his mortgage payments . Or that he had developed a lower-back injury , so that the least motion would cause him agony . Stern saw himself running over with extended hand and showing the man that he would not take advantage of him , that he would not fight him in his weakened condition , that Jews forgive . He wanted opportunitiesto demonstrate that Jews are magnanimous , that Jews are sweet and hold no grudges . He pictured the man 's boy falling down a well , and Stern , with sleeves rolled up , being the first to volunteer to work day and night digging adjacent holes to get him out . Or the man 's child being stricken with a rare disease and Stem anonymously sending checks to pay the medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stern . And then he saw himself and the man becoming fast friends from that point on , Stern inviting him in to the city top120meet Belavista , showing the man he did n't mind his work clothes . But mostly he wanted the back injury , and clenched his fists and squeezed his eyes hard , as though just by straining he could make it happen . If only there was a way , he thought , that he could pay to make it happen  --  even a large figure like $8,000 , which he would work off at $10 a week . His room-mate asked , " Do you mind any farting ? " And Stern said , " I do n't have any views on that . " " I cut loose a few , " said the man , " but I wanted to ask , because I know a lot of the younger'ones object . " The room was thick with the smell of merchant marine sheets , and Stern sat up , touching his stomach to see whether it had gotten any better since he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something in here and I wonder how long I 'm going to have to take to get it out of here , " Stern said . " I 've got the weakness is all that 's wrong with me , " said the man . " I 've had it ever since I left the circuit . I did comedy vignettes . I used to get fifty-two straight weeks in those days , but snappers killed me off and I ca n't work any more . You see , I never used many snappers , maybe three a night . What I 'd do is work around m'crowd , futz them along a little , nurse them , slowly giving them the business , and then , maybe after twenty minutes , I 'd come in with m'snapper . I 'd use maybe three a night , four tops . Nowadays the new ducks throw them out a mile a minute , no futzing in between , just one after another . Anyone who books you wants you to shoot out a million snappers before he 'll even consider you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and now I 've got the weakness . " I do n't know what to say to any of that , " Stern said . " I 'm just here to get rid of something I 've got in here . " " Suck what ? " said the man.  | " What do you mean ? " asked Stern . " That 's one of them . One of my old snappers . I 'd ask a Saturday night bunch if they had any special song requests , and when they hollered out a few , I 'd take my time , do a little business with m'feet , and then say to them , Suck what ? " ' The room seemed to have gotten narrower , and Stern was afraid that someone would seal him in with the merchant marine sheets and the old actor . " I 'm just going to go out and get the feel of the place , " Stern said , getting up from the bed . Stern walked outside in the hall and got his first look at the half man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his body , about half had been cut away . In the shadows , with a handkerchief around his neck and a violin in his hand , he made a beseeching sound at Stern . His voice seemed to come from some place a foot away from him and sounded like a radio turned on a little too loud and tuned in to a small , dying station in New Jersey . Stern walked ahead , his face frozen , as though he did not see the man , and on the way down the steps he heard an off-key violin melody played with sorrow and no skill , muffled by a closed door . Stern wondered whether at some future date , when halves started to be taken out of him , he too would be farmed off to a home to sit unlovedin the shadows and play a tortured violin . Downstairs on the front porch a scattering of people talked beneath a great insect-covered bulb . An old man , gray-haired , draped over a wooden banister like a blanket , winked deeply and called Stern forward . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him clinging insect-like against poles , draped over rails , propped up against walls , but never really standing . Whenever the people at Griggs moved somewhere as a unit , to meals or to the outdoor stadium , the strongest would always carry Rooney , whop122weighed very little , and see that he was perched or propped up or laid comfortably against something . His main concern was the amount of money great people had or earned , and his remarks were waspish on this subject . He poked Stern in the ribs and said , " Hey , the President do n't make much dough , does he ? I mean , he really has to hustle to scrape up cigarette money . " He chuckled deeply and , poking Stern again , said , " You know who else is starving to death ? Xavier Cugat . I mean , he really do n't know where his next cuppa coffee 's comin ' from . " He became convulsed with laughter . " He goes to one of them pay toilets , he 's got all holy hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , choking with laughter and poking Stern , " we would n't want to be in his shoes , would we ? We sure are lucky not to be Cugie . " He started to slip off the rail and Stern caught him and propped him up again . " Thanks , kid , " said Rooney . " All them guys are starving , you know . " A tall , nervous , erupting teen-age boy was on the porch , pushing back and forth in a wheelchair a Greek youth who Stern learned had had a leg freshly cut off in a street fight . A blond nurse with flowering hips passed by and the Greek boy said , " The last day I 'm going to jazz that broad . They 're going to let me out , see . That 's when I tear-ass up the steps and catch her on the second floor and jazz her good . I going to jazz her so she stays jazzed . " " Where are you tear-assin ' ? " said the tall boy . He combed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheelchair . " You got one leg gone . " " Shut up , tithead , " said the Greek boy , concentrating hard . " I jazz her . Then they come after me and I cut out to Harlem . I cut out so they never find me . " " Where you cuttin ' ? " asked the tall , nervous boy . " You ca n't cut nowhere . " " You 're a tithead , " said the boy in the wheelchair.  |p123Stern  approached the pair and the tall , blond boy said , " How are you , fat ass ? Jesus , " he said to the boy in the wheelchair , " you ever see such a fat ass ? " Stern smiled thinly , as though this were a great joke and not an insult . " I 've put on a little weight because of something I 've got inside me , " he said . " It certainly is a lovely night . " The tall boy erupted in violence . " You trying to be smart or something ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in panic . " Talking like that . You trying to make fun of us ? " " Of course not , " Stern said . " What did you say lovely for ? We 're just a bunch of guys . The way I see it , you think maybe you 're better than the rest of us . " " It 's just a way to say something , is all , " said Stem . The boy was a strange mixture , exploding with rage one minute and lapsing into a mood of great gentleness the next . The latter quality took over now , and he began to pour out his thoughts , as though he might never have another chance to talk to someone so smart he used " lovely " and was n't even showing off . It was as though the occasion called for conversation only on the highest level . " I 've got bad blood , " he said , the violence gone . " I could n't get into the Army with it . I work on high wires , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use a safety harness . You know , I 'll just swing from one wire to another . The guys see me , they flip out . I 'm not afraid of anything . You get killed ; so what ? Then my blood gets lousy and I have to stay in bed three months , six months , I do n't care . I just like to have freedom . A bunch of us guys was sitting around at Coney Island eating a plate of kraut and the man comes over and says it 's time to close and takes away my plate of kraut . He did n't say it nice or anything . Rightp124away he 's stepping on our head . So we really give it to him and run the hell out of there . I hit him with the whole table . " But you see what I mean ? " he said with an overwhelmingtenderness , as though Stern were his first link with civilization and he wanted Stern to interpret his positionbefore the world . " A guy has to have freedom . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your head when you 're eating a bowl of kraut . " " Sounds pretty reasonable , " said Stern . " Are you sure you 're not trying to show us up ? " the boy said , erupting again and taking Stern by the collar . " No , " Stern said , imagining the boy hitting him with a table . " You 're all right , " the boy said , the gentleness returning . " I 'll bet the only reason you have a fat ass is because you 're sick , right ? " " That 's why , " said Stern . " Maybe one night  --  George , you , and me  --  we all go downtown to get some beers . " By sliding and slipping from railings to banisters , Rooney had attached himself to a pole close to the trio . " You know who do n't have a pot to piss in ? " he said . " The guys who run this place . They do n't eat good at all , do they ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a many-legged insect . The little staff room inside the front door lit up now , and from within , behind a counter , the Negro attendant said , " Line up for bandage and pill . Staff quarters are not to be entered . " The porch people lined up outside the staff room , Rooney sliding and clinging along as the line moved . The old actor had come downstairs and was standing alongsidea dark-haired woman with sticklike legs and a thinp125mustache . Her head was covered with a kerchief and she tittered shyly as the old actor whispered things into her ear . He was very courtly toward her , making deep , gallant bows , and Stern wondered whether he had shown her any medallions . Stern stood at the end of the line next to a paunchy , middle-aged man who introduced himself as Feldner . " You 're an intestinal , I hear , " the man said . " I had what you had , only now I 'm in here worrying about something else . You 're a pretty smart boy . I heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ? " " I write labels for products , " said Stern . " I worked the casinos all my life , " said the man . " All over Europe , lately the Caribbean . But I was always betting on the wrong rejyme . I 'd put my money on a rejyme , see , and then I 'd be working a table , making my three clams a week , when bingo , a plane flies over , drops a bomb , and we got no more casino . Once again Feldner 's got his money on the wrong rejyme . One rejyme in South America give me an ulcer , what you got . But now I 'm worrying about something else . How 'd you like to write a book about a guy who always bet his money on the wrong rejyme ? " When Stern 's turn came , he saw that the Negro , inside the staff room , had taken off his intern 's jacket . He had great turbulent shoulder muscles , and Stern wondered what his legs looked like , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me in the high ass region , " he said , his back to Stern , preparing Stern 's medication . " Pacific . It pinched off a nerve and caused my legs not to move . " Stern welcomed the sudden intimacy and said , " You get around fine . I never saw anyone handle things so smoothly . When I was a kid , I used to go up to the Apollo on Amateur Night in Harlem . You 'd see some really fine acts there . That 's where Lena started , and Billy Eckstine. "  |p126He  put his foot inside the door and the Negro turned swiftly , jaw muscles pumped up with rage , and said , " There is not to be any entering of the staff room . " Stern said , " All right . " He was the last one in line , and when he had swallowed his medicine , the Negro lowered the staff-room light and Stern went upstairs . On the top step the half man was waiting for him , a bandage around his neck . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadows and said , " Look what they did to me , " his voice coming from a static-filled car radio on a rainy night . Stern pushed by him , making himself thin so as not to touch him , closing his eyes so as not to see him , not daring to breathe for fear he would have to smell the neck bandage . He got into his narrow room and shut the door tight and wondered whether the half man would wait outside the door until he was sleeping and then slip into bed beside him , enclosing the two of them in his bathrobe . The old actor was wheezing deeply and Stern got between the damp merchant marine sheets , wondering whether Fabiola had n't made a mistake in sending him to this place where he had to look at half men , as though to get a preview of horrors in store for him . He touched his middle and , disappointed that the great globe of pain still existed , began to pat it and knead it down , as though to hurry along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off to a nightmare of sleep were of the man down the street . It struck him as unfair that no matter how many pills he put inside his stomach , no matterhow gently he rubbed and patted it , no matter how healthy he got at the Grove Rest Home , he would still have to go home and drive past the man 's house twice a day . The man would still be there to start Stern 's belly swelling again . How unfair it was . Could n't bodies of medical people be dispatched to tell the man that Stern was re/ceiving treatment , was getting better , and he was to leave him alone and not bother his wife and child , otherwise Stern would crack with pain once more ? Bodies of medical people with enforcement powers . Could n't Grove send a group of envoys of this nature on ahead of him before he got home , so the man would know ? Stern awakened the following morning to a sweetly cool summer morning , and waiting to welcome him was the actor , standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underwear , sequined in places , gathering the folds of it into his stained pants , and rubbing his meager arms . " Got to get the pee moving , " he said . " What did you think of my doll ? That 's good stuff , boy . Gon na get me some of that stuff . " Stern said she was very nice and dressed quickly . The old actor , still rubbing his arms , said , " You ought to try this . Nothing like it to get your wang-wang in shape . " Downstairs , on the porch , the Griggs people stood around silently in the dewy morning , and when Stern and the actor arrived , they all began a dumb march to the dining room , a broken parade led by the tall , erupting boy with the boneless , insectlike Rooney in his arms . Carrying Rooney was a privilege that went to the strongest of the group . After them came the Greek boy , wheeling along furiously , saying , " Wait up , fuckers , " and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , oldfashionedtoothache towel around his neck , radio-croakingto the wind . In the dining room he took a table by himself . Stern sat with Feldner and a small , scowling man who kept invoking the power of his labor union . He tried a roll , found it hard , and said , " I do n't have to eat a roll like that . " " Why not ? " Stern asked  | " I belong to a powerful union . " Later , when his eggs were served , he said , " Union gets you the best eggs in the country . " Stern ordered some cereal . When he took a spoonful , Feldner stopped his hand and said , " You ca n't eat that . " " How come ? " Stern said . " Not in the condition you 're in , " he said . " I had what you got . You 're a nice kid , but it would tear you up . " " I get to eat cereals , " said Stern . He buttered some bread and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I told you I had what you got . I been all over the world , in every kind of country . You 're in no shape to eat that . " " I have a different kind of doctor , " Stern said , eating the bread but wondering whether Feldner 's doctor was n't better than Fabiola . " There 's only one thing you can eat with what you got , " said Feldner . " What 's that ? " Stern asked . " Hot stew . The warm is what you need . It warms you up in there and heals everything up . The way you 're eating , you 're dead in a month . " " I have a doctor who says bread and cereal are all right , " Stern said , but the pain ball seemed to blow up suddenly beneath his belt and he wondered whether to call Fabiola and check on stew . At the next table , the old actor made courtly , charming nods at the mustached stick woman . When she turned to blow her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , poked Rooney , who clung to a chair next to him , and said , " Hey , get this wang-wang . " At Stern 's table the sullen , scowling man said , " They do n't take oddballs in my union . Any crap and out you go . " Finishing his meal , Feldner patted his lips and said , " You better be careful , kid . I know what you got in there.  |p129You  ca n't go eating shit . You get the hot of a stew in there and you 'll see how nice it feels . I know . I 'm worryingabout something else , but I had what you got . " At the meal 's end , the half man , who had sat alone , eatingswiftly and furtively , got to his feet and began to gather everyone 's dirty dishes and stack them in piles . " It 's always the worst ones who are the nicest , " said the plump dining-room waitress . " It was that way at Mother Francesca 's , too . " Stem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had felt his eyes , and at one point had been compelled to go and sit with him , staring right at his neck bandage and saying , " Do n't worry . I 'll sit with you . In fact , I 'll stay with you until the last half is taken away . " He felt that maybe if he sat with the half man , someone would sit with him later , when he himself began losing halves . But on his way out of the dining room , when the half man looked up at him , he ran by frightened , as though he did n't see him . Outside , the old actor grabbed him and , pointing to the mustached woman up ahead , whispered , " I 'm going to get me some of that . That 's real sweet stuff . You got to work it slow when you 're handling one of them sweet dolls . " Stem stayed five weeks at the Grove Rest Home , and during this period the pain balloon that had crowded tight against his ribs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snaps of his trousers around his great girth . On some mornings during these weeks he would awaken and for an instant feel he was at the New Everglades , a mountain resort where he often spent summers as a child with his mother . Those summers days he would get up early and run down to cut a purple snowball flower for his mother to wear , wet and glistening in her hair , at the breakfast table . They were lazy , wicked times , and since he wasp130the only young boy at the resort , he spent them among young women , playing volleyball with them , doing calisthenics , and staring fascinatedly at the elasticized garmentsthey kept tugging at as the material crept below their shorts line . Afternoons he would lie in the bottom of a boat while his great-breasted mother , wearing a polkadottedbathing suit that stared at him like a thousand nipples , rowed across the narrow resort river to the hut of a forest ranger who lived in the woods opposite the resort all year long . Stern hunted mussels in the shallow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emerged from the hut she would say to him in the boat , " A hundred girls at the hotel and I 'm the only one can make him . " To which Stern answered , " I do n't want to hear anything like that . " Later , in the afternoon , Stern would sit at the resort bar with his mother , taking sips of her drink while his mother told the bartender , " That does n't frighten me . I 'll give him a little drink at his age . It 's the ones that do n't get a little drink from their mothers you have to worry about . " The men around his mother at the bar told dirty jokes to her , and one afternoon one of them , holding his palms wide apart and parallel , said , " Baby , my buddy here has one this long , so help me . " His mother folded up with laughter on her barstool , and Stern , suddenly infuriated , hit the man in the stomach to protect her . His mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say things to his mother . He 'll kill for her . " Later , getting ready for dinner , Stern 's mother would take him into the shower with her and he would stare at the pathetic , gaping blackness between her legs , filled with a terrible anguish and loss . Then he would rush down to cut another flower for her and , in the coolness of the evening , begin to feel very lush and elegant , as though no other boy in the world was having as wicked and luxurious a time as he , the only boyp131in a grown-up resort . His mother would tell him , " You 're growing up too fast . You know more than kids ten years older than you . " And later in the year , at school , Stern would tell his friends , " Boy , do I know things . Did I see things this summer . My mother is n't like other mothers . She just does n't go around acting like a mother . " And yet , with all the panty glimpses on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dirty jokes and the nervous showers , what did he actually know ? It remained for a busboy in back of the resort kitchen to tell him about the sex act . Stern could n't believe the actual machinery and said , " Really ? " and the busboy said , ' Yeah . When you put it in them , they get a funny feeling up their kazoo . " The Grove Rest Home had the sweet summer coolness and the proper fragrance , but it was a parody of a resort , with all its facilities torn and incomplete . Stern heard there was a small golf course and borrowed clubs one morning , setting out to look for it . He tramped the length of the institution and finally spotted a flag in the center of some tall weeds far beyond the kitchen . A bald man with a thick mustache stood alongside the single hole of the golf course , hands locked behind his back , puffing out his cheeks and flexing an artificial leg in the style of a British colonel surveying a battlefield . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had fallen on his leg and sheared it off . His main difficulty had been in dealing with his grown son , who could n't get used to having a one-legged father . " I told him you get older , these things happen , but he would n't buy it and kept spitting on the floor . " The man spoke with a thick Brooklyn accent , but when he was silent , flexing his leg , he took on an amazingly autocratic demeanor , a British colonel once again . " Are you playing ? " Stern asked him . " No , I 'm just standing next to the hole here . " The golf course was a broken , one-holed , weeded one ,  |p132and  Stern 's days at the Grove Rest Home seemed weeded and broken , too . There were no scheduled activities , and between meals Stern passed the time in the library , readingperipheral books , ones written by people who had been close to Thomas Dewey and others about Canada 's part in World War II . The only newspaper available was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Stern waited for it eagerly at the front door each night , pacing up and down until it came . He looked forward , too , to " milk and cookie " each evening at seven , which was the nearest thing at the Home to a special treat . One night , when he was in line for his refreshment , the mustached woman squatted down on the front porch and began to urinate , throwing her kerchiefed head back and hollering , " Pisscock , pisscock . " Gears clanking and grinding and seemingly slower than ever , Lennie came out from the staff room and made for her , finally getting there and carrying the woman , screaming , up to her room . Later , Stern learned she had been taken to Rosenkranz . In the room that night , the old actor said , " I really liked that doll . She was sweet stuff , I mean really sweet . Too bad she got the mentals . When she gets out of here , I 'm going to get me some of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the climactic events at Grove seemed to take place on the porch during " milk and cookie . " Another night , the scowling union man , two places ahead of Stern , fell forward and died . The patients made a circle around him , as though he were " it " in a sick game , and Rooney hollered , " Give him mouth-to-mouth . " Afraid he would be called upon to do this , Stern said , " I 'll get someone , " and ran wildly into the field beyond the building , making believe he was going through the proper procedure for handling recent deaths . He came back after a few minutes to look at the union man on the floor . It was the first dead person Stern had seen , and the man did not look sweetp133and peaceful , as though he were asleep . He looked very bad , as though he had a terrible stomach-ache . No one had done anything yet , and the half man was now standing in the circle , croaking , " See what happens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed to stand with the others only on occasions such as this , a thing he knew all about . Finally Lennie arrived , stern and poised , and leaned over the man . " This is a death , " he said coolly , and Stern thought to himself , " Why did Fabiola send me here ? How can I possibly be helped by seeing guys dying and half men ? He made a mistake . " Yet , despite the wild urination and the curled-up dead man , Stern 's pain diminished gradually . Sometimes , when he sat in the fields on endlessly long afternoons , waiting for the days to pass , he would probe his middle cautiously , as though he expected to find that the ulcer had only been playing dead and would leap out at him suddenly , bigger than ever . But the circle of pain had grown small and Stern thought how wonderful it would be if the kike man was getting smaller too , if when he got back to his house , he could find the man completely gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as though he 'd been taken by acid or never existed . One morning , late in Stern 's stay , word spread that two industrial teams were coming to play baseball for the patients at the Home . There was much excitement , and Stern felt sorry for those shriveled people whose only fun had been at YMCA 's and merchant marine recreation parlors . Not one had ever seen My Fair Lady , and it was small wonder they looked forward with such delight to a clash between two industrial teams . In early evening , the night of the game , Stern took his place in the dumb march formation and walked to the field , poking his belly and feeling around for the pain flower . It had been replacedp134by a thin , crawling brocade of tenderness that seemed to lay wet on the front of his body and was a little better than the other . But he wondered whether the ulcer might not roll forth in a great flower once again , at the first trace of friction , and then he would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was aware that in just a few days he would have to go back to the kike man . What would happen if he merely drove by once , saw the man 's great arms taking out garbage cans , and felt the flower instantly fill his stomach , one glimpse wiping out five weeks at the Grove Rest Home ? And what if it went on that way , five weeks at Grove , one glimpse at arms , another five weeks at Grove , arms , until one day the flower billowed out too far and burst and everything important ran out of him and there was no more ? Stern walked behind the tall , sputtering , explosive boy , who led the march with Rooney in his arms . " You know who we ought to take up a collection for ? " Rooney asked Stem as the Rest Home people took seats in the front row of the small grandstand . " Who 's that ? " asked Stern . " Yogi Berra , " cackled Rooney . " I understand he 's down to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onto a bench in the front row and he clung gelatinlike to it , saying , " That Berra does n't make ten bucks the whole season , " and shaking with laughter . Stern sat between the tall , erupting young boy and Feldner . The boy , who was alternately nice and violent to Stern , asked him , " Did you ever play any ball before you picked up all that ass fat ? " " A little bit , " Stern said . " And I 'm not that heavy back there . " He was afraid of the boy 's sudden eruption and wondered why the boy could n't be nice to him all the time . Violence was such a waste . It did n't accomplish anything . Stern had to worry that the boy would suddenly erupt and push him through the grandstand seats , maybep135snapping his back like wood . He wanted to tell the boy , " Be nice to me at all times and I 'll tell you things that will make you smart . I 'll lend you books and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a museum , explaining any hard things . " One of the teams represented a cash register company and the other a dry cleaning plant , and as they warmed up , the old actor ran out onto the field , stuck a bat between his legs , and hollered to the grandstand , " Hey , get this wang-wang . Ai n't she a beaut ? " A tall , light-skinned , austere Jamaican Stern thought might have been a healthy-legged brother of Lennie was the umpire , and he thumbed the actor back into the stands , saying , " Infraction , " and then folded his arms and jutted his chin to the sky , as though defying thousands . In the stands , Feldner , in a bathrobe and slippers , shoulders stooped from years of bending over crap tables , said to Stern , " We had softball games when I was working under one of the Venezuela rejymes . You know how long that rejyme lasted ? Four days . I really backed some beauties . That 's how I got what you got . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man whose shoulders had grown sad from so many disappointments , and wanted to hug him to make him feel better . Once , Stern 's mother , infuriated at having her clothing allowance cut down by his father , had gone on a strike , wearing nothing but old bathrobes in the street . This had embarrassed Stem , who had turned away from her each time she had walked past him and his friends . Now Stern wanted to embrace Feldner as though to make it up to his mother for turning his back on her saintlike bathrobed street marches . Stem watched the men on the two teams pepper the ball around the field and then looked at them individually , wondering if there were any on either team he couldp136beat up . They all seemed fair-skinned and agile , and Stern decided there were none , until he spotted one he might have been able to take , a small , bald one playing center field for the cash register team . But then a ball was hit to the small player and he came in for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be too rough , also . He imagined the small , stumplike legs churningtoward him in a rage and was sure the little man would be able to pound him to the ground , using enduranceand wiriness and leg power . A black-haired Puerto Rican girl came to sit with the tall , erupting , blond boy . She helped a nurse take care of a group of feebleminded children connected to the Home and Stern had seen her with a pen of them , doing things slow-motion in the sun . From a distance she seemed to resemble Gene Tierney , but up close he saw that she was a battered Puerto Rican caricature of Gene Tierney , Tierney being hauled out of a car wreck in which her face had gone into the windshield . She did things slow-motion , in the style of the retarded children she helped supervise . Sitting on the ground in front of the tall , blond , fuselike boy , she said , " You promised we were goin ' dancin ' . " " Shut your ass , " the tall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one ? Two nudists , man and a broad , had to break up . You know why ? They were seein ' too much of each other . " The Puerto Rican girl giggled and leaned forward in slow motion to tickle the tall boy . Stern saw her as a Gene Tierney doll manhandled by retarded children in temper tantrums , then mended in a toy hospital . " Your sense of humor is very much of the earth , " she said . The tall boy introduced Stern to the girl . " This is Mr. Stern , " he said . " He 's a swell guy , even though he 's got a fat ass . I 'm sorry , Mr. Stern ; only kidding . He 's really a good guy . Real smart.  | " Listen to this one , " the boy continued . " I know a guy who was invited out by Rita Hayworth . He was in her house at the time . " The tall boy erupted with laughter and the Puerto Rican girl tickled him again in slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's a natural man . I 'd like to feel his energy coursing through my vitals . " In the distance , Stern had imagined her hips to be flaring and substantial , but actually they had a kind of diving , lowslungpoverty about them . She wore a skintight blue skirt , and Stern wondered whether she had n't worn it for an entire year and was to wear it the next three until povertystrickenPuerto Rican underwear came bursting through its fabric . Still , the combination of Latin eroticism and intellect flashes appealed to him . It was a painful thought , and he actually gritted his teeth as it came to him , but he had to allow it to come through . This tattered Puerto Rican watcher of feeb kids was probably smarter than his wife , close to what he 'd really wanted . She probably knew undreamed-of , exotic Puerto Rican love tricks . He could bring her lovely sets of underwear , tighten up some of her poetic allusions , and make her the perfect wife . He wished she was tickling him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl . He wanted to tell her he knew better jokes , smooth situational ones , and if only she gave him a fair chance , several days of intensive conversation , she would see he was a better bet than the tall , corny boy . But he felt very old and heavy and was unable to speak . " Got another , " said the sputtering , fuselike , blond boy . " Would you rather be in back of a hack with a WAC or in front of a jeep with a creep ? " The girl dug her fingers hungrily into his ribs , saying , " You promised we 'd go dancin ' . " " Eat shit , " the tall boy said , brushing her aside . " You know , " he said to Stern , " I was once in bed for eight months . My kid sister took care of me in a little room justp138big enough for the two of us . Every once in a while my veins give out and I ca n't do anything . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; you die , you die . Only thing I care about is freedom and old guys not pushing you around . " The game had begun now , and the wheelchaired Greek boy had maneuvered himself alongside the bench in the front row . He stuck his hand under the Puerto Rican girl 's dress and she cringed back against the tall , grenadelikeyouth , saying , " I intensely dislike duos . " Stern wondered what would happen if he went under there , too . He envied the wheelchaired boy . He 'd gone under and nothing had happened . He had n't been hauled off into court . The Greek boy stared out at the cash register company pitcher and said , " He 's a crudhead . I could steal his ass off . He makes one move to pitch and I 'm on third like a shot . " " What are you gon na do ? " said the tall boy . " Crawl on your balls ? " " Shut up , tithead , " said the Greek boy . Feldner nudged Stern and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was only one rejyme ever let us play . " Then he hollered out , " Swing , baby , swing ; you can hit him , baby , " as though to demonstrate to Stern his familiarity with the game . " See , " he said , and Stern wanted to take him around and soothe him for being a bathrobed failure who was worried about a mysterious new something inside him . Sitting in the grandstand now , feeling Feldner 's warm , bathrobed bulk against him , Stern , despite the tender sheet that lay wet against the front of his body , felt somewhatcomfortable and took a deep breath ; as though to enjoy to the fullest the last few days before his return to the kike man . He was afraid of the charged and sputtering boy on his left , afraid that in a violent , pimpled , swiftlyp139changing mood he might suddenly smash Stern back through the grandstand benches . Yet , despite the grenadelikeboy , Stern still felt good being at a ball game among people he knew , broken as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a long time , it seemed , living as he did in a cold and separate place , and he thought now how nice it would be if all these people were his neighbors , Rooney in a split-level , Feldner next door in a ranch , and the old actor nearby in a converted barn . Even the half man would not be so bad to have around , living out his time in an adjacent colonial until the last half was taken away . All of them would form a buffer zone between Stern and the man down the street . That way , if the kike man ever came to fight him on his lawn , his neighbors would gather on the property and say , " Hands off . He 's a nice guy . Touch him and we 'll open your head . " Late in the game , a line drive caught the little bald cash register outfielder in the nose and he went down behindsecond base with a great red bloodflower in the center of his face . There were no substitute ballplayers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule book , said , " Forfeit , " jutting his chin toward the grandstand , as though ready to withstand a hail of abuse . " I 'll run that coon the hell out of here , " said the wheelchairedGreek , waving his fist . " I come to see a ball game . " " That 's right , " said the tall boy , pimples flaring , beginning to ignite . Suddenly , his face softened . He grabbed Stern 's collar and shouted , " We got someone . This guy here will play . Do n't mind his fat ass . " To Stern , he said , " I did n't mean that . I know you ca n't help it . " He turned to the Puerto Rican girl and said , " Hey , a man brings home a donkey , see . So all day he goes around patting his ass . " The girl smiled , showing salt-white teeth with only the tiniest chip on a front one . She lay back , putting her head on the tall boy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Puerto Rican underwear caught the sunlight . " Boredom and you are ever enemies , " she said to the tall boy . " Please sneak out and take me dancin ' . " The others in the stands were cheering for Stern now , and he stood up , afraid the tall boy 's pimples might sputter into violenceagain and also not wanting to hurt anyone 's feelings . It was easy to just start trotting out toward the field . He fully expected to turn back with a big smile and say , " I 'm not going out there . Not when I 'm sick . " But he found himself jogging all the way out to center field , unable to get himself to return . Winded , he stood in a crouch , hands on knees , as though capable of fast , dynamic spurts after balls . He hoped the Puerto Rican girl was watching and would see him as being potentially lithe and graceful , equal to the tall boy . Feldner ran out in his bathrobe and slippers and said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you got ? You play and you 're dead in a minute and a half . " Stern motioned him back , saying , " I 'm not sure I have what you had . Everyone 's got a different kind of thing . " But when Feldner turned away , discouraged , Stern was sorry he had been harsh to a man in a bathrobe . From the stands , Stern heard the Greek boy shout , " You show ' em , fat ass , " and Stern hoped the girl would not think of him only as a man with a giant behind . The austere Jamaican umpire checked Stern , looked at his rule book , said , " Legalistic , " and turned stoically toward the wind . The second hitter hit a pop fly to short center field , and Stern , since childhood afraid to turn his back and go after balls hit past him , joyfully ran forward and caught the ball with his fingertips , so thrilled it had been hit in front of him he almost cried . He did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infield , wishing at that mo/ment the kike man was there so he could see that Jews did not sit all day in mysterious temples but were regular and played baseball and , despite a tendency to short-windedness , had good throwing arms . A sick , reedlike cheer came from the torn people in the grandstand after Stern 's catch . At the end of the inning , he trotted toward the dugout and heard the Greek boy say , " Nice one , fat ass , baby , " but he averted his eyes with DiMaggio-like reserve and sat on the cash register team 's bench . Feldner came over in his bathrobe and said , " What did I tell you ? " " What do you mean ? " said Stern . " Look at yourself . You should see your face . " " I look all right , " said Stern . " And I 'm playing now . " Sitting among the lean , neutral-faced cash register team , he was ashamed of Feldner 's bathrobed presence and motionedhim away . But , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shout , " Come back . You 're more to me than these blond fellows . " Stern got to bat in the inning . Afraid the dry cleaning pitcher had discovered his Jewishness and planned to put a bloodflower between his eyes , too , he swung on the first pitch , hitting it on the ground . Forgetting to run , he stood on the base path and actually squeezed with his bowels , hoping the ball would get past the third baseman . When it filtered through the infield for a hit , Stern hollered " Yoo " and ran to first , sending home the runner in front of him and tying the score . His team won in that inning and the patients gathered round him on the field . " You clobber their ass , baby , " said the Greek boy with genuine sincerity , reaching up from the wheelchair to pat Stern 's back . The tall boy , with gentleness in his lips , the ticking in him fading , said , " No fooling , you get around good . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The Puerto Ricanp142girl , still lying on the bench with gaping skirt , said , " We 're all goin ' dancin ' tonight . Either alfresco or in my place . The group has much charm . " Only Feldner had misgivings . " You signed your death warrant out there , " he said , and for a moment Stern felt a bubble tremble outward insidehim ; he was certain he was going to have to pay for his indiscretion by starting from scratch with a brand new ulcer , slightly larger and a fraction more formidable than his first . But the bubble fluttered and withered , like a wave breaking , and the patients kept congratulating him . He had struck a blow for sickness . As a reward he got to carry Rooney back to the porch for evening " milk and cookie . " Late that night , the tall , blond boy and the wheelchairedGreek came for Stern as he sat alone on the porch . The others had gone to bed and the tall boy said , " We 're meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I figure we get a few beers and , later , diddle her boobs . " " I take her upstairs and do some jazzing , " said the boy in the wheelchair . Stern , flattered at being selected by the two , and not really sure how to say no , got up from his chair , giddy and dangerous in the night . The trio started down the corridor and then heard Lennie rasping and clattering after them , a man with a machine shop going full blast below his waist . " There is to be no disobedience of the nighttime rules , " he said , and , as the boys turned to face him , Stern wondered which side he would be on in a fight . He imaginedLennie standing against the wall , looking patiently at Stern , while the tall boy bent his contraptions and tore out his clamps and gears and the Greek boy hit him many times on the head to no avail . Stern pictured him/self watching this , frozen to the side , asking Lennie , " Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machinery mangled , finally turning from Stern with great calm and slowly rising up , trunklike and great-armed , to hug the breath out of the two boys , subduing them for the night . As it was , the Greek boy merely wheeled around , saying " Coon fucker " under his breath , and the tall boy , with great sweetness , said , " We were just being happy with Mr. Stern for getting a hit with a fat ass . " The two boys returned to the dormitory , and as Stern walked after them , the Negro stopped him and said , " There can be a little staying up later sometimes . If authoritiescome , though , I did n't see you . " Stern said , " Thank you , " but he felt very uncomfortable about the favor and wanted to do a thousand quick ones for the Negro . He wanted to tell him that if he ever got into trouble with the police , he could hide in Stern 's house , or if he ever wound up helpless and drugged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the middle of the night and cut through red tape to get him into a decent hospital . But the Negro clattered off in a metallic symphony and Stern sat guiltily on a chair , staring off at the winking lights of Rosenkranz . He stayed up late , sucking in the dewy air , exulting in its freshness , aware there were only a few days before his return to the kike man and yet thrilled that there were those few days . He wished that he were clever enough to stretch his mind so that he could turn those days into eternities , fondling each second , stretching it , cramming a lifetime into it before yielding it selfishly for the next one . Perhaps if he stayed on the porch and stared at the night , pinned it with his eyes , he would be able to hold it there and forever block out daylight . Across the field he studied Rosenkranz and wondered whether at some future date he might not him/self be taken there , ulcer-free but a mindless urinator now , squatting beside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cackling at the walls . The following night , the three evaded Lennie and dashed drunkenly at midnight across the lawn toward the main gate , the tall , blond boy propelling the Greek ahead , as though the wheelchaired youth were a wild street hoop . " We meet that coon fucker tonight , " said the Greek , his vehicle skidding across the wet grass , " he and me goingto tangle asses . " Stern kept looking back over his shoulder at the main building , as though he were a child running away from home , taking one giddy step and then another but always remaining close enough to dash back and say he was only fooling . He wondered what punishmentLennie would mete out if they were caught  --  and could he protest it to a higher authority without appearing to be anti-Negro ? If Lennie made him stay in his room , for example . Since there were only a few days left , he would probably stay in there and let it go without fuss . The tall boy suddenly released the wheelchair and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a whip , swinging easily in the wind . " Are n't I a crazy bastard ? " he said from above . " That 's what the guys said when I was working on high wires . I never used a safety harness . I do n't care if I fall down and break my head . " He swung from branch to branch like a lean night animal and the Greek boy said , " I 'm cutting out . I do n't want to do no stuff on trees . I want to do some jazzing . " " How you going to get up here ? " said the tall boy . " With your bony ass ? " Stern wanted to tell him not to make fun of the young Greek 's missing leg , but the tree swings had intimidated him and he had no desire to run up against the tall boy 's explosive wiriness . Dropping easily to the ground , the tallp145boy flung the wheelchair on ahead of him and said , " Did you see me up there ? Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care what happens to me . " Stern said , " You were very good up there , " and the boy said , " But sometimes everything stops in me . I lay in bed for six months and I ca n't get out . My kid sister brings me soup . It 's in my veins . That 's what I 'm in here for . " There were no guards at the gate , but as they rolled toward it , Stern had a sudden fear that Lennie had been watching them all along ; the instant they passed the gate , he would have them picked up in trucks and initiate punitive measures . " They do n't like you to go through this gate , " Stem said , but the Greek boy , wheeling right through , said , " I got to hop on something . Then I 'm happy . " And Stern raced along after the pair . The three of them traveled seven blocks in darkness , and when they came to a small bar and grill the blond boy said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't go no more than a few days without a few brews . " The Puerto Rican girl was waiting for them in a booth , and it seemed to Stern that she was more like Tierney than ever , Tierney after a session with two longshoremenwho 'd been paid to rough her up a little , not to kill her but to change her face around a little . She wore a bulging black sweater , and her paper-white teeth were chipped a little . Stern , drunk with the danger of having run away from the Home , wondered what her teeth would be like on sections of his body ; perhaps they would nibble erotically at him in the style of some primeval creature of the Puerto Rican rain forests . " And so ends my solitude , " she said as the blond boy slid in beside her . Stem , a weakened , dropping , off-balance feeling coming over him as a result of her literary flourish , took a seat across the table . The Greek boy swung close , chewing onp146his nails , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place stinks , " he said . " We got better places in East Harlem . " " Get this , " said the blond boy , poking the girl in the ribs and winking at Stern . " You know what a kiss is ? An upper persuasion for a lower invasion . " The girl pecked at his ear with her chipped teeth and said , " Forever play the jester . " The proprietor , a tall , toplike man who looked out on the street as he spoke , came over and asked , " What 'll it be ? " " We 're just in here nice , " said the blond boy . " We came in here nice and all we want to do is drink nice . Nobody bothers us , we do n't bother nobody . Right , Mr. Stern ? Did n't we come in here nice ? " " Yes , " said Stern , smiling at the man , feeling the air charge up and wanting to stop whatever was about to happen . The brocade of tenderness appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could take any trouble , and he imagined himself collapsing and having to be carried back to the Home by his two friends , the Puerto Rican girl walking contemptuously behind , aware now that Stern had the least romantic disease of all . " Brews all around , " the blond boy said , his mood suddenlysweetening . When the proprietor returned to the bar , the blond boy squeezed the girl 's breasts and said , " How they hangin ' , doll ? " " Hey , George  --  motorboat , " he said , waggling his head from side to side against her breasts and making a droning sound in his throat . " I do n't go for that , " said the Greek boy , eating deep down on his nails and leaning forward on his wheelchair , as though watching a tense horse race . " I like to do some real jazzing . " The girl sat patiently through this , running her fingers through the blond boy 's hair . " The physical side , " she saidp147to Stern , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as though he too considered breast-nuzzling a bore . The proprietor brought the beers and said , " Pay now . " The blond boy said , " Remember what I said when we came in ? I said we 're coming in here nice . Nobody pushes us around , we do n't do any bumping either . Now you come over and you say pay now . " " It 's a house rule , " said the proprietor , staring out the window . " Everybody pays now . " Stern , the brocade tighteningaround his stomach and wanting to do something , put down two dollars and the proprietor took it . The Greek boy said , " You think you got such a hot place here . This place stinks . " He spit on the floor and the proprietor went back to the bar . " That 's what I was telling you , " the blond boy said to Stern with a pleading compassion in his voice . " Nobody gives you freedom . You come into a place nice , you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look what happens . " " He thinks just because he 's got a fancy place he can give you shit , " said the Greek boy . " I spit on his ass . " The blond boy 's mood suddenly changed and he took hold of one of the girl 's breasts again . " Good set , huh , Mr. Stern ? " And Stern nodded sweetly in agreement , looking apologetically at the girl , as though he was only going along with this line of conversation to be polite and really never thought of such things . " What about the dancin ' ? " the girl asked , looking over at the jukebox . " Does my love feel a tango within him ? " " Dancing , shit , " said the blond boy . He looked over at the proprietor , who was rinsing glasses , and said , " He comes over here again , we get him . You can be nice up to a certain point . " " He thinks he has a fancy place , " said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balls . " Stern , his stomach pumping , wanted to say , " Wait . Nop148fighting . You have other things , but I have an ulcer , the kind of thing you should n't get excited with . What if I get hit in it and get another new one ? " When the proprietor came over to the table , the blond boy arranged his fingers like two donkey 's ears and stuck them swiftly in the man 's eyes . The proprietor said , " I ca n't see now , " holding his eyes , and the Greek boy grabbed his hair and yanked the man 's head down on his lap , saying , " I ought to cut your balls . " Then he held the man by the hair in a bent-over position and the tall , blond boy began to kick at the man 's upper legs , the kicks making sharp , fresh cracking sounds , like new baseballs off a bat . Stern , who had stood by doing nothing , wanted to say , " Stop , you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad , but now you can do spinal injury . " But a current began snapping through him and he looked for something to do . There was one other person in the bar , a small man with a toothbrush mustache who was eating a heavy soup . Stern ran over and grabbed him from behind , pinning his arms . " I 'm not in this , " said the man . " That 's all right , " said Stem , ecstatic over being in the fight , his stomach free and easy . How wonderful it would be , he thought , if he could be transported in this very condition to the kike man 's front porch , the current snappingthrough him , the same excited sweat in his arms . He was certain he would be able to fight him and not feel a single blow , and for an instant he thought of jumping in a cab and speeding back to his house , gritting his teeth to preserve the mood . The cab fare would be $150 or so , but it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to fade , the sweat dry up , and he found himself nearing the man 's house with a growing fright , worrying about beinghit in the ulcer ? He saw that he would have to get there instantaneously or it would not work . After many kicks , the proprietor said , " That 's enough , "  |p149and  the blond boy , as though waiting for him to signal with those very words , said , " Let 's cut , " shoving his wheelchairedfriend through the door . Stern said , " I 'm letting you go now , " to the mustached soup eater and ran out the door after the girl , looking back at the proprietor . He was relieved to see that the man was standing ; it seemed to him that only when people were on the floor might there be police involvement . The quartet ran through blackened , neatly shrubbed residential streets , and Stern wonderedhow running was for the ulcer . Would jogging up and down disengage it and cause it to take residence in another part of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a grenadelike , blond boy with strange vein problems ; a wheelchaired Greek ; a heavy Jew with ulcer-filled stomach ; and a strange , Tierney-like girl who spoke in literary flourishes . And yet they were comradesof a sort and he was glad to be with them , to be doing things with them , to be running and bellowing to the sky at their sides ; he was glad their lives were tangled up together . It was so much better than being a lone Jew stranded on a far-off street , your exit blocked by a heavyarmedkike hater in a veteran 's jacket . They slowed down after a while and Stern put his arm around the girl 's waist , as though he had been unable to stop and was using her to steady himself . Her neck was wet from the exercise , and the pungent dime-store fragranceof her hair brought him close to a delighted faint . " Hey , you grabbin ' my girl , " said the blond boy , and , with a straight face , whipped a blue-veined , grenadelike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible instant and saying " Pow ! " instead of landing the blow . Then he threw his head back and howled , saying , " You grab my girl , I got to give you one . Pow , pow , pow ! " " Suivez-moi to my petite habitat , " said the girl , going up ahead of the group . " And a young girl shall lead them . "  |p150Not  sure whether further waist encirclements were permissible , Stern walked beside her , and she said , " I used to work in a hardware store . You meet a princely selection of spooks there , it being near the main drag . One such spook came in one morning and said his friend wanted to spend the evening with me for $140 . I asked him where yon friend was . He said he was across the street in a building watching the two of us with a telescope and would come down if I assented . I replied in the negative , of course . I 'll entertain a man , to be sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are many spooks in this land of ours . " Stern , flattered that she had told him an anecdote , was not sure what to reply and decided he would tell her about his ulcer , testing her reaction . " I 've got something inside me . That 's why I 'm at the Home . I 'm not sure how all this running around will affect me . " The shits , " she said . " I know them . The shits are a chore . " She whirled around now and slid her fingers under the shirt of the tall , blond boy . " Does the darling midnight fool feel a cha-cha within him ? " she asked . The blond boy took one hand off the wheelchair , tapped the underside of her breast , and said , " Flippety-flippety . Hey , Stern , you see that ? Flippety-flippety . " The girl led them to the last house at the edge of a dead-end street ; a sign saying " Tina 's Beauty Salon " was in the center of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a white luminescent stripe across the bottom of its slender trunk , making it look like a thoroughbred horse 's taped ankle . " My queenly habitat , " said the girl , and led them through the front door and down a long corridor with lined-up rows of hair-drying machines . She opened a door at the end of the corridor and guided them now into a small , sparely furnished room with a single bed and onep151wall papered with Broadway show posters . The lamplight within was warm , making her features seem smoother and heightening the Tierney resemblance ; Stern , weakened now by the bulge of her black sweater , the things she had been saying , and the show posters , wondered how it would be getting a divorce , being bled financially , and starting up anew with the Puerto Rican girl in this very room . The girl flicked on a victrola , putting a finger to her lips , and said , " I 'm just a tattered tenant here . " She closed her eyes and swayed to the music as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind the beat , in the slow-motion style of the feebleminded children she watched each day . Holding out her arms to the blond boy , she said , " Step inside this delightful sound . " The blond boy came over , pinched her skirt , and said , " Check your oil . " Then he pointed to the Greek boy , who sat staring out at the stars , rubbing his hands as though washingthem in a sink . " Dance with George , " said the blond boy . " Hey , George , dance with the broad . " The Greek boy , his back to the others , a lawyer deciding a case , said , " I do n't like dancing . I came out with you to do some jazzing . " The tall boy suddenly grabbed the Greek 's wheelchair and pushed it out the door , saying , " I got an idea . " Inside the beauty parlor room , he picked up a cigarette holder , put on a hairnet , and sat beneath a hair dryer . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Stern and the girl . " I 'm an old broad . " The girl closed the door and said , " Boredom sets in swiftly . " Still swaying to the music , she asked Stern , " What is your work ? " Thrilled by her sudden interest and loving the way she had asked the question , Stern said , " Product labels . There 's some writing to it , only not literary . " Dancing with closed eyes and lagging behind thep152beat , she said , " Someday I , too , shall write a volume . I shall include the sweetness and bile of my life . " She stopped dancing now and said , " One of the spooks at the hardwarestore asked me to do some modeling . Bearded chap . Does figure work mean you work in the altogether , or does one get to keep a doodad on ? " " I do n't get into that in my work , " said Stern . " I do n't like the sound of what you said , though . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed the record to a fox-trot now and , taking off her skirt , said , " How would I look adorning maga-zines ? " Stern stopped breathing , and it suddenly came home to him that they were only a mile or so from the Grove Rest Home and that he was supposed to be undergoing treatment . He was certain that he would be caught , and he tried to imagine what untold horrors would await him if he were brought before the Home committee . At the very least they would throw him out , marking his records so that he would be banned from other rest homes when , at some later date , new illnesses came on . Then he imaginedone gentile on the committee smiling thinly and saying , " No , no , let 's let him stay , " and then seeing to it that he was given a daily allotment of tarnished pills so that his stomach sprouted an entire forest of ulcers . She put her hand on her hips in a terrible thirties pose and then took off her sweater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; I 'd forgotten . " Her breasts poured forward , capped by slanting , evil , Puerto Rican nipples , and Stern had a sudden feeling that his wife , at that very moment , sad-eyed and chattering with need , was hoisting her own sweater above her head in the rear seat of a limousine , that there was a strange sexual balance wheel at work , and that for every indiscretion of Stern 's his wife would commit one too , at best only seconds later.  |p153Like  a discharged mortar shell , the tall , blond boy , a salivated look of rage on his face , charged into the room now and said , " Oh , you lookin ' at my girl 's nips , eh ? " He shoved Stern against the wall and shot his fist at Stern 's neck , stopping once again at the final instant and saying " Fwot " instead of landing the blow . Then he became convulsedwith laughter , doubling up on the bed and howling , " I got you again . " The boy stood up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smacking sounds and said to the Greek , " Good set , eh ? " Stern , feeling somehow that the girl 's breasts were going to get hurt , walked over to her and said , " We were discussing something and she was demonstrating it . " The tall boy said softly , " Oh , that 's all right . I just like to diddle her boobs a little . George and me will take ten outside and kid around with those dryers . " Then , with increasing kindness , he said , " You know the way you say things ? Like what you just said ? You were discussing something . That 's nice . The way you have of saying all the thoughts in your head . " Stern noticed now for the first time that the boy 's T-shirt had holes in it , and he felt very sorry for possibly having taken something away from him . What if his veins acted up and he had to spend six months in a room , unable to swing from trees and make believe he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We can all stay in here and play around , " said Stern , but the blond boy walked out , saying , " That 's all right , Mr. Stern , sir . " To the boy in the wheelchair , Stern said , " You can stick around , " but the Greek youth , rubbing his hands , said , " No , I do n't feel like it tonight . You know , some nights you 're just not in the mood for jazzing . " He wheeled himself out of the room , closing the door behind him , and the girl put her arms around Stern 's neck and said , " Sweet riddance . Now , my knighted author , will you be with me on the highest of all levels ? "  |p154Minutes  previous , when she had taken off her clothes , Stern had planned merely to stare at her and fix her in his memory . Perhaps he would tap her behind and feel her breasts in the style of the other boys and then race back across the streets to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somehow if he did more , the Home would definitely hear of it , his treatment would be disrupted at an early stage , and he would be doomed to walk the streets forever with a permanent ulcer blooming between his ribs . And , of course , if he were to go further , within minutes his own wife , skirt gaping and great eyes confident , would sink back comfortably on the rear cushions of some strange convertible . He waited for an outraged knock at the door , the clatter of Lennie 's machine-shop legs , but nothing came and he fitted his hands over the girl 's nylon-covered buttocks , thinking that he had never held a Puerto Rican behind beforeand that maybe it was a little different . She took his ear between her chipped white teeth , as though she were an animal pawing meat , and said , " Wondrous author of mine , explore forbidden avenues with deponent thine . " She guided him to the bed , did a dipping thing to make herself nude , and said , " Honest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Stem , who loved the things she said . She pulled him to her and said , " Then thrill my secret fibers . " She put a contraceptive on him and said , " Now , honey , do n't spoil it . Really , let 's do a good one . " It bothered Stem that she had the contraceptive on hand , but he liked the way she managed it , and the idea of her having one ready suddenly threw him into a frenzy . After a moment , she whispered , " We are as pages in a book of sonnets . Really give it to me . " He said , " All right , " and after a few seconds she rose and said , a little irritatedly ,  | " Oh , you thrilled me , all right . You really thrilled me . " She got into her clothes , and then the irritation passed , and she perched on the bed beside him and said , " Such loveliness I have never known . " Her bare brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had loved the things she whispered to him and the sting of her teeth pulling on his flesh like meat . " Tell me of your literary prowess , " she said . The door opened and the blond boy came in and said , " We 're tired of sitting around out there . " Stern looked out in the corridor and saw the Greek boy 's wheelchair against the window . He went outside to him and found the boy crying . " My leg is gone , " he said . " I ai n't got two fucking legs any more . " Stem took the boy 's head against his waist and rubbed his neck , trying to think of something to tell him . But there was nothing . What could he say ? That the leg would grow back again ? " Some people have things even worse than legs in their stomachs , " he said finally . He wheeled the boy inside the room , where the girl sat perched on the bed . The tall , blond boy picked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , let 's give her a ride . " He quickly slid the broomstick between the girl 's legs , and the boy in the wheelchair , getting the idea , dried his eyes , wheeled close , and caught the other end , so that they had her straddling the stick as though she were on a fence . They began to lift her up and down on the broomstick , the two of them howling at the ceiling , while the girl shouted , " Lemme off , you bastards . " Stern shouted , " You 'll hurt her down there , " but she looked so awkward , he stopped loving her immediately . When she cursed at them , Stern looked at her and said , " I ca n't do anything . " " Hey , Mr. Stern , keep her up there , " said the blondp156boy , and Stern took the Greek boy 's end and tossed her up and down a few times , saying , " I 'm going to do this a little , too . " They finally let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she smoothed her hair and pretended nothing had happened . " Let me tell you further of my book , " she said to Stern . But , after seeing her on the pole , the thought of her terrible Puerto Rican writing disgusted him and he said , " No literary stuff now . " She bent over then , holding her crotch , and said , " Ooh , you really hurt me down there , you cruddy bastards . " Stern felt good that she had addressed all three of them , not excluding him , and it thrilled him to be flying out of her apartment with his new friends , all three howling and smacking each other with laughter at the pole episode . He wanted to be with them , not with her . He needed buddies , not a terrible Puerto Rican girl . He needed close friends to stand around a piano with and sing the Whiffenpoof song , arms around each other , perhaps before shipping out somewhere to war . If his dad got sick , he needed friends to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He needed guys to stand back to back with him in bars and take on drunks . These were tattered , broken boys , one in a wheelchair , but they were buddies . They skidded across the lawn , wildly recalling the night 's events . The blond boy : " You see me kick that guy 's ass ? Pow , pow , pow ! " The Greek : " We almost ran that broomstick up the broad 's kazoo , man . " Stern : " Did you see me hold that strong little guy at the bar ? " They split up at the main gate , each stealing back to his room separately . " Tomorrow night , maybe we do somep157real jazzing , " said the boy in the wheelchair as they parted . Exhilarated as he slipped past Lennie 's darkened office , Stern , approaching his room , felt his stomach and was surprised to find the tapestry still prickling raw against it . Perhaps excitement is not good for it , he thought  --  even good excitement . But it did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the first time that if necessary , by God , he would live with the damned thing . He opened his door now and saw the half man , bathrobe flown apart , toothache towel around his jaw , sitting on Stern 's bed . The sleeping actor 's foot stirred momentarily , tapping the edge of the bed in time to some forgotten vaudeville turn . Stern wheeled around in a panic , wanting to flee the room until the half man was out of there and his bed was scrubbed . He went out into the hall , but the half man chased and caught him , gripping Stem 's wrist in a death vise . " Question , " he radio-croaked in the dark hall . " What ? " asked Stern , his eyes closed so he would not see the half man , not daring to inhale lest he smell his halves . " You Jewish ? " the man asked , croaking so close his mouth worked against Stern 's ear . " Yes , " said Stern , shutting his eyes until they hurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wheeling Stern around so that he had to face him . " I 'm Jewish , too . " It did not thrill Stern to hear this . It was no great revelation , and it failed to touch him , just as the man 's terrible violin playing had not moved him either . He said , " OK , " and freed his wrist , but as he walked away a crumbling chill seemed to invade him , starting between his shoulder blades and pouring through all of him . He turned and kissed the man and hugged him and put his nose upp158against the man 's toothache towel , and then , perhaps using some of the courage he had amassed that evening , embraced the man 's bad side , too . He had counted on firm handshakes and hearty goodbyes , exchanged phone numbers , pledges to continue friendships , and deep sincere looks in the eye , but on the morning of his departure he found that the people at Grove hung away from him . He was sitting on the porch with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rooney in his arms , and he said to Rooney , " I 'm all better and I 'm going home today . " Rooney , who had been clinging to a pole and making waspish comments about the wealth of horse owners , turned to Stern and said , " You did n't say anything about that . " The old actor overheard Stern and said , " What did you come up for , if you were only staying such a little time ? That 's really country , boy , really country . " It was as though by getting healthy he had violated a rotted , fading charter of theirs and let them down . He had come into their sick club under false pretenses , enjoying the decayed rituals , and all the while his body was n't mined at all . He was secretly healthy , masquerading as a shattered man so that he could milk the benefits of their crumbling society . And now he felt bad about not being torn up as they were . " I did n't know you were n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I had what you got , and I needed the warm of a stew in me every day for two years . " " I may have to come right back , " said Stern , trying to make the man in the bathrobe feel better . He went over to the charged-up blond boy , who was leaning on the young Greek 's wheelchair , and said ,  | " Maybe you can take a run by my place when you get sprung . But the camaraderie of the wild evening was gone . " You were n't even in here much , " said the blond boy , and the Greek youth said , " Yeah , what 'd you come up here  --  to fool around ? " Only Lennie was consistent that morning . He had taken Stern 's baggage out of the room himself , and when Stern tried to help him , he said , " No infractions on last days . There are patients who rupture before check-out , and legal suits come about . Patients to the right as we take baggage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he loaded Stern 's valises onto the baggage rack and walked intricately into his office . " Final pill , " he said to Stern , getting one ready in a little cup . When the Negro handed him the pill cup , Stern stuck a folded-up five-dollar bill in the pocket of the intern 's jacket . His mother had always stuck bills in the pockets of busboys and waiters and , after each insertion , had said , " I never missed that kind of money . You should see the respect I got for it . " Lennie took the bill out of his jacket , examined it , and put it back in his pocket . He started to turn around , but then he changed his mind and asked Stern , " Anyone around ? " Stern said everyone was out on the porch , and the Negro said , " Come on in here then , " beckoning Stern into the forbidden office . " Have a seat , " said Lennie , locking them both in . He sat down himself , releasing gears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He thumbed through it , stopped at a page , and said , " The old actor guy . Guy you roomin ' with . He go around sayinghe got the weakness . He ai n't coming out of here . They been trying to get him ready for another operation , but he too weak . " He flipped the page and said , " Girl check in here two days ago , " referring to a young and prettyp160blond girl who had kept to herself . " She says she restin ' . Well , she got something in her from intercoursin ' with a man too big for her . Who else you want to know ? " " None of the others right now , " said Stern , wanting to leave the room but afraid to offend the Negro . " That 's all right , " said Lennie , turning to another page . " Rooney , the guy you carryin ' . Bones softening up ; nothingthey can do on him . He be here for the duration . " He flipped again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He gettin ' out but ai n't got no more'n a year . " " Without referring to the book , he said , " The half guy you see stalkin ' around . He surprisin ' everybody . He gawn be around when they all through . " The Negro ran through the other patients , while Stern made himself small in his chair and tried to block out all sound . After the last patient , Stern found himself putting another bill in the Negro 's pocket , as though he had n't realized what he was getting and saw now that he had underpaid . A sweet and choirlike glow came over the Negro 's face as he showed Stern out of the office and began to push the baggage cart . All the way to the administration building he blurted out secrets of the Home . " Nobody know it , but they get tranquilizer every day , " he said . " Guy gon na die , we shift him to Room 12 so we can whip him out of there when he go and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ batch of secrets , Stern compulsively stuffed another bill in the Negro 's jacket , wanting him to stop and tell no others , yet paying him for each pair . On the front steps of the administration building , Stern saw his wife 's car . The Negro , a little flustered , strained for a climactic one and finally said , " Staff get to eat better than the patients . We get better cuts of meat and all we want . " Stern let Lennie get his bags on the car rack and stuffed a final five into his pocket.  | " You did n't have to tell me any of those , " Stem said , getting behind the wheel and taking his last look at the Grove Rest Home . But then , lest he hurt the Negro attendant'sfeelings , he said , " But thanks , " and swept out of the driveway . " I thought I 'd always have it in there , but the parachuteis gone , " Stem told his wife as they drove home . " It feels as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , but it 's better than the chute . " She sat beside him with one tanned leg folded beneath her , her great eyes glistening , wet with expectancy . She wore a cotton jumper , and when Stem leaned over to kiss her , he saw that her blouse was loose and he could make out the start of her nipples beneath her half bra . It got him nervous , and he said , " Why are you wearing your blouse like that ? When you bend over , people can actually see the nipples . That is n't any damned good . " " It is n't ? " she said , teasing him . " Oh well , do n't worry ; it 's only when you get real close . " " None of that 's funny , " said Stem . " I just got out of the goddamned place for my stomach . Do you still go to that dance class ? " " Oh yes , " she said , sitting against the door , her eyes huge . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First we dance like crazy and then we congregate at the overnight diner on Olivetti Street . That 's the best part . You should hear one of the girls talk . Dirtier than anything you 've ever heard . She 's a scream . Then Jose spins me home , since he lives out our way . " " Is there any more of that tongue stuff ? " Stem asked . " Do n't be silly , " she said . " He kisses everybody . It 's what they do . " She hung back against the door , her skirt above her browned knees , and Stem wondered whether she hadp162gone to bed with the instructor , getting into tangled , modern dance positions with him . How did he know she had n't spent the entire five weeks of his sickness at endless , exhausting , intricately choreographed lovemaking , flying to the instructor seconds after she had deposited Stern at the Home ? She seemed curled up , contented , shimmering with peace , as though someone had finally pressed the right buttons and relieved the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with . Perhapsshe had gone to him in a desperate way , knowing that the instructor , however thin of bone and feminine of gesture , would never allow her to be insulted and would attack any offender with Latin fury . In any case , the secret was locked between her warm thighs . He would never know what had gone on , and he felt a drooping , weakened sensation and wondered why there could n't be a chemicaltest , a litmus paper you could hold up to women to find out how many times they 'd been to bed since last you saw them . " We 're having a recital and I 've got to rehearse practically every night . It saved me while you were away . I 'd have gone crazy . " " I do n't know about any recitals , " Stem said . " I 've got to have everything easy on me . I do n't want that thing coming back . I never want to go back to any rest homes . If I go back there , I 'm really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stern left , Rooney , hanging from an overhead porch beam , had told Stem of a merchant seaman who had gotten over an ulcer and who subsequently was incapable of being riled . " You could stick it into him from morning till midnight and he 'd just give you a little smile and off he 'd go like a contented cow . " Now , as he drove home , Stern , who had spoken sharply to his wife and had felt the hot brocade tighten against the front of him , began suddenly to follow thep163procedure of Rooney 's man . He held the controls gently in his hands , tapping lightly on the foot pedals and scanningthe road ahead easily , as if too vigorous a motion might topple his head from his shoulders . He began to do things in a slow and mincing way , as though he might be able to whisper and tiptoe through life , hushing his way past death itself . At the tollbooth , he smiled meltinglyat the uniformed attendant , and when the man took his fifty cents , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why did you thank him ? " his wife asked . " Why not ? " said Stem . Later , when they approached the outskirts of Stern 's town , they drove past small houses with neatly kept lawns and Stern nodded in a friendly way to the people who stood outside them . He knew they were all gentiles and he wondered what would happen in a pogrom . Which ones , if any , would hide him and his family from the authorities ? Probably quite a few , he thought ; ones that would surprise him . Probably the people with the most forbidding gentile faces . Ordinarily they 'd never have anything to do with Stern , but if it came to a pogrom , with New England crustiness they 'd spirit Stern and his family off to attics , saying to one another , " No one 's goingto tell us what to do with our Jews . " As they drove past the man 's house , Stern held his breath and closed his eyes for a second , as though there were a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away five weeks , and perhaps part of his cure was that the man 's house would be swept away or that it would disappearas though it had never been there , much like his vanished ulcer . But the house stood in the same place , and Stern , as he drove by , inclined his head gently toward it , as though he would face whatever horrors lay inside with softness and gentle ways , melting them with his niceness . As he neared his own house , he wondered fleet/ingly what he , the man down the street , would do in the event of a pogrom . Would he startle Stern by spiriting his despised Jewish neighbors away in his cellar , hating pogroms as even more un-American than Stern ? In his house , Stern sat down in the easy chair of his sparsely furnished living room and said to his wife , " Softly and easily . That 's how it 's going to have to be . No noise . No upsets . " His son came out with a bandage on his elbow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Stern said , " I 'm not doing any dying for a while . But there 'll be no rough playing any more . Everything with Daddy is soft and easy . Where did you get the cut ? That 's the kind of thing I do n't want to get involved in , but where did you get it ? " " I found it on me in the morning , " said the boy , beginning to suck a blanket . Stern 's wife , who had been boiling eggs for him in the kitchen , hollered in , " There 's one last thing you 're going to get a kick out of doing . The kind of thing you 'll enjoy . I 'll tell you about it later . " Stem started to eat the eggs , but they stuck in his throat and he said , " What 's the thing ? I do n't want to get into anything two minutes after I 'm back from a rest home . " " I would n't tell it to you , except it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some kids came by on a bike , older than him , and one of them cut his elbow with a mirror and called him Matzoh . ' I 've been furious , but I saved it for you because I know it 's the kind of thing you 'll want to settle . " " He does n't live around here , that bad boy , " said Stem 's son . " He 's just visiting someone here . I wish you 'd make the boy die . "  | " Daddies do n't make small boys die , " said Stern . The brocade that lay across the front of him began to heat up , and he pressed his fist deep into his stomach and held it there , on guard lest another ulcer begin to sprout forth and fill his ribs . " Nobody seems to have heard what I 've been saying , " he said to his wife , but then he clasped his son 's head and said , " You 're right ; it is the kind of thing I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy to his car , squeezing his hand , and for a second it seemed that the child was really holding his hand , leading Stern and protecting him . He drove the car in a wide arc , as far as possible from the kike man 's house , and the child said , " You 're going too far . The bad boy wo n't be around here . " " You point him out to me , " said Stern , the front of him on fire , crouched over as though to give the flames less area to ruin . They came to a cluster of seven boys who 'd gotten off their bikes to rest , and Stern stopped the car , gripping his son 's hand for courage . He went among them and said , " Someone said something to my son and cut him . They said a dirty thing to him , and it had better not happen again . " " Do n't make them dead , " his son said . " They 're not the bad boys . " Stern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close , and said , " I can really get sore , and when I do I can really start swinging . That better not happen again . " The boy looked at him evenly , without fear , and Stern released him . He must have been around twelve , and Stern wondered whether he would remember and two years later , at fourteen , with his body shaping into athletichardness , come after Stern and pummel him to the ground . Stern got back into the car with his son and , continuingp166in the arc , he drove slowly through the streets and stopped alongside a small boy with glasses and large feet who was walking next to the curb , carrying books . " Someone said something lousy to my son and cut him , " Stern said from the car . " I do n't like the particular kind of thing they said . " " I 'm not a little boy , " said the book carrier . " I 'm seventeenand finishing high school . I 'm small and everyone thinks I 'm a kid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Stern 's son . Stern felt very sorry for the small high-school student with his big feet , and yet he was thrilled to find someone in the neighborhood who read books and was n't fierce . He wanted to invite him to his house and give him books , maybe take him to New York to see Broadway plays . " Come over if you 're near my place , " said Stern , and drove off . " I think the bad boy is visiting over there , " said Stern 's child , pointing in the direction of the house that darkened Stern 's every waking moment . Nonetheless , he knitted his eyebrows , bared his teeth , and gunned the motor , as though , by going through the motions of outrage , he would somehow become outraged and the momentum would carry him right up to the man 's front door before he had time to change his mind . He raced toward the man 's house , and yet , when he reached it , the fraud of his facemaking became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had never intended for a second confronting the man . In his own home , Stern 's wife asked , " Did you find him ? " And Stern said , " I do n't want to do any finding . Do n't you realize I just came home from a Home a few hours ago ? " For one blissful second then , Stern 's vision blurred and it seemed that he had gotten it all wrong , that he hadp167not been away at all , and that he was to leave that very evening for a place where everything would be made better for him . But then he caught the edge of a chair , his eyes cleared , and he realized that he really had been away . The thought that he had come back to find his situation unchanged was maddening . It was as though he had been guaranteed that the treatment would heal his neighborhood as well as his ulcer  --  and that the guarantee had turned out to have secret clauses , rendering it worthless . The man was still there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not somehow arranged to have him eliminated . His father had not gone down the street to thrust his scarred nose up in the man 's face . No hand had reached down from the heavens and declared that the man had never existed . He was still right there in his house , not even seriously sick . Stern went upstairs , and as he sat on the edge of his bed he felt a small spring inside him stretch and finally break , leaving his body in a great tremble . He lay back on the bed , as though mere contact with a bed could cure anything , but he could not quiet himself , and so he dialed Fabiola . " A brand new thing has happened , " Stern told him . " There 's a tremble in me and I ca n't control it . The thing is , I 've just come back from the damned rest home . Can you just come back from a place like that and have something like this happen ? " " Yes , " said Fabiola . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wind up back there again . Remember that and call me if you get into more trouble . " Stern got on his knees now , as though in prayer , clutchingfistfuls of sheet and trying to squeeze out the tremble . The bedroom windows were darkening with night when his wife appeared , flinging off her shorts , combing her hair , and saying , " I 've got to go to rehearsals . "
