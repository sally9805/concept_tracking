America 's Economic Growth To the Editor : My long-standing admiration for James Reston 's cogent journalism was put to the test by his April 5 column on Communism and economic development in Latin America . That column , you may remember , portrays Latin America as a continent that had bogged down on the development road , and accordingly had become vulnerable to the onslaughts of every trivial Communist band that chose to march down from the hills or take sanctuary in a university dormitory . Now I am well aware that this is the conventional wisdom . in the matter , and that facts are sometimes no more than an irritant when they collide with such strongly held preconceptions . At the risk of being a gadfly , therefore , let me point out that since 1950 Latin America 's gross national product has been growing annually at an average rate of about 5 per cent a year , j which is just about the rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While population increases have soaked up the larger part of that gain , living standards have risen by 2 per cent a year . To put it another way , the income of the average Latin American is 35 or 40 per cent higher in 1966 than it was in 1950 . Social Gains Literacy levels , health levels , education levels . and housing are all markedly improved . Industry is growing very fast in most countries , typically at the rate of 7 or 8 per cent a year . By anyone 's standards , Latin America is growing . None of this is cause for uninhibited self - congratulation . The material progress in Latin America has been accompanied by the usual inequities , frustrations , breakdowns , and general social pain which goes with growth . More of , the same is in prospect . Those parts of Latin America 's population that were once held docile by ignorance , malaria and tmdernourislunent are beginning to appreciate some of what they have long missed , and are beginning to want more . Leadership for this discontent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been lacking . It does not do to say , therefore , that this unhappiness is a consequence ' of lack of growth . It would be closer to the mark , even if a little misleading , to say just the opposite . The American people are mature enough , it seems to me , to be told that economic growth and political stability do not go hand in hand ; that in striving for the first , they ought not to assume they will achieve the second . Until that point has been widely acknowledged , public support for our international aid efforts will be built on spongy foundations , and disillusionment with our aid efforts will be chronic .

RAYMOND VERNON Cambridge , Mass. , April 5 , 1967 The writer , Acting Director of the Center for International Affairs , Harvard University , is the author of " The Dilemma of Mexico's1 Development . " ? Basis for Ban on Aid - to Church Schools To the ' Editor : Your March 29 editorial " Church and State : Separation " is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this state who firmly believe in the principle of separation of church and state . There is just one point which I believe needs some further clarification . Referring to Section 3 of Article XI of the State Constitution , you say that it is " commonly known as the Blaine amendment . " It was not the Blaine amendment : it was not even an amendment , and thus ' it is a distortion of history to call it such . There seems to be a deliberate attempt on the part of those who would like to eliminate Section 3 , Article XI , from our Constitution to discredit it in a subtle way by associating it with a personality . Blaine had nothing to do with ? this section . He died the year before the convention of 1894 . In 1875 James G. Blaine , then a member of the House of Representatives , in a letter . to a friend expressed his concern over the possibility . that any individual state might " establish religion , " although it was prohibited by the First Amendment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was thought that it only ' referred to the rights of ' Negroes . As a matter of fact , it was only after the Jehovah 's Witnesses ' case in 1940 that it became recognized that the amendment had any bearing on the guarantee of religious freedom . Resolution Defeated In his message to Congress in 1875 President Grant sug- , gested legislation " . prohibiting the granting of any school funds , or school taxes . . . by legislature , municipal or other authority , for the benefit or in aid , directly or indirectly , of any religious sect or denomination . " A week later Blaine presented a joint resolution to Congress embodying these ideas ; it passed the House but lost by two votes in the Senate . You put Section 3 , Article XI , of the New York State Constitution in its proper perspective when you say that it was " placed in the Constitution by the convention of 1894 to guarantee continuance of a principle that had been established by statute half a century earlier . " This statute was passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as a result of the agitation of Archbishop Hughes for public funds for . parochial schools in the eighteen-forties . Rev. Dr. W. STANLEY RYCROFT . Yonkers , N. Y. , March 29 , 1967 ? Gun Liability Coverage To the Editor : Your April 5 editorial on " Gun Control Needed " . mentioned that the registration of guns with the police would be no greater hardship for sportsmen than a driver 's license for an automobile . ' owner . . I should ' like to extend this . thought further ; Just as with a car , the owner ' of a gun should be required to carry fi7. nancial liability Insurance coverage for any damage that he does with a gun . This would . ' cover both accicdental and deliberately caused injuries or death to humans and animals . ' It would also cover damage to property . Before a gun could be purchased , proof of liability coyerage would be , required . This . proof would also be necessarywhen application is made for a hunting license .

Your recent series of editor : rials lamenting the lackluster performance of the New York Legislature now adjourned is-. both amusing and fatuous . If memory ' serves , prior to the last two legislative elections you ' gave endorsements for re-election to each legislator now con- : . : stituting the leadership of the . Senate and Assembly . It is in : , comprehensible to me how you can support continual re-election of those representatives and complain about their lack of ' statesmanship. in responding 1 .

Legislature , ' as everyone knows : In future editorials will you be so naive as ' to expect the con , vention to make fruitful accomplishments hi light of the proved ineptitude of its controlling . spokesmen ?
