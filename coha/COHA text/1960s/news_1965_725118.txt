txt Toward a Better City The greatness of American society will be determined , in Important measure , by the future of the urban areas in which more than three-quarters of all Americans now live . By their votes in New York and many other cities in last Tuesday 's off-year elections , millions of citizens registered both their concern about the slow downhill slide of their communities and their faith that something could be done about starting them back uphill by installing men of courage , inventiveness and independence in City Hall . , In the process the voters made plain once again their unwillingness to suffer with docility under the boss rule that has contributed so much to municipal decay . Even more important , they served notice on politicians of all parties that bloc loyalties do not control when the electorate is given a meaningful choice between candidates of vision and of mediocrity . That is the significance , in particular , of the victory of John V. Lindsay as Mayor of New York . A liberal Republican , he won in this overwhelmingly Democratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a liberal whose toughness of spirit had been battle-tested on Capitol Hill . And he won because New Yorkers saw in him the best hope for leadership in the hard climb toward a cleaner , safer , better educated , better integrated community . * * * - If he is to succeed  --  as he must succeed  --  Mr. Lindsay will need the full cooperation of the Democrats who retain their top-heavy preponderance of voting strength in the Board of Estimate and the City Council . Whether this Democratic majority will be used to foster teamwork or paralysis in municipal affairs is likely to be determined by the quality of the relationship that develops between Mr. Lindsay and Frank O'Connor , whose victory as Council President has given him new status in the battered ranks of his party . A pooling of all New York 's creative forces behind decisive , progressive policies unrelated to partisan advantage is plainly what the electorate wants and what-it will insist on getting . Not all of the job can be done at City Hall , however . There is need for building better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indispensable parts to play in helping this city improve its schools , its housing , its health facilities and its other municipal services . That strains exist between Governor Rockefeller and Mr. Lindsay was painfully evident during the campaign ; the cl , ty , : s . needsjust not be made the victim of their feud or of any aspirations Mr. O'Connor may have for a change of address in 1966 . After his injudicious intervention in the campaign , President Johnson lost no time in seeking to allay the impression the Democrats had propagated before Election Day that the White House would do little for New York with a Republican Mayor . Mr. Johnson said what he should have said from the first : The Federal Government will cooperate unreservedly with New York officials in solving the city 's problems " without regard to party affiliation. " crucial as such cooperation is , the salvation of this biggest and most cosmopolitan of cities will not come through any easy assumption that all the cost and all the sacrifice can be evaded by shifting the bill to Uncle Sam or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still rests on New York and its people ; a solid start has been made with the election of John Lindsay  --  but only a start . His commitment was summed up in his Election Night pledge : " I will not fail . " - These are words each New Yorker must echo , for Mr. Lindsay can not succeed alone .
