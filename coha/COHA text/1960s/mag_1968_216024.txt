IN the course of their work , TIME ' correspondents , writers and editors enjoy contact with most of the world 's newsmakers . Recently , we started a new program of inviting some of these newsmakers to address the entire staff of the magazine . So far this year , our guests have included New York City 's mayor , John Lindsay , and Comedian-Politician Dick Gregory . Last week TIME 'S 300-seat auditorium had an S.R.O . crowd for William F. Buckley Jr. , witty archconservationist of conservatism . <P> We are progressing into an " Age of Unreason , " said the columnist , commentator and quondam politician . Its heroes include " Norman Mailer and a couple of children in tennis shoes deciding to levitate the Pentagon " ; its politicians include such men as Arthur Schlesinger Jr. , who thinks that " a President with too much power is a President without Schlesinger at his side " ; its liberal economics lean to the quaint axiom that " there is some virtue in elongating the distance between where a dollar is collected and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agility never flagged all through the question-andanswer period that followed his talk . Asked what he thought would happen to Mayor Lindsay 's political career if he were appointed to the Senate , Buckley disposed of his former opponent with a casual " I do n't know . Where will he give fewer speeches ? " And what about ex-Mayor Robert F. Wagner 's appointment as Ambassador to Spain ? Nothing wrong with that , said Buckley of his former Democratic nemesis ' new assignment . " After all , he does n't have to run Madrid . " <P> While working on this week 's cover story about Soul Singer Aretha Franklin , the members of TIME 'S music staff were impressed by the fact that " soul " can be found-or its absence noted-in individuals far removed from the world of music . Cover Writer Chris Porterfield , Senior Editor Jesse Birnbaum , Reporter Virginia Page and Researchers Molly Bowditch and Rosemarie Tauris Zadikov concocted their own soulful list along with a matching roster from Straight City . Their " Arbitrary Guide to Soul " runs along with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to send in their own nominations .
