CBS was worried . Christina Crawford , one of the stars of the soap opera The Secret Storm , had been rushed off to the hospital for emergency surgery . Who would fill in for her ? Mother , of course , for Mother is Dowager Screen Queen Joan Crawford . Price was no problem ; Joan was happy with union minimum . But how could a 60-year-old woman pass for the 27-year-old she was to play ? No problem either . A session with the makeup man and a youthful hairdo , plus her own well-preserved looks , turned the trick for the four segments Joan will appear in . After that , the character will be written out of the show until Christina gets back to the set . Said Christina , eldest of Joan 's four adopted children : " I could n't exactly jump up and down in bed about it , but it was fantastic she would care that much . " <P> There was standing room only in the National Film Theater when London 's cinema fans turned out en masse to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movie making . But the appointed hour came and went with no sign of the speaker . Finally , the disappointed audience was read a telegram from the elusive Godard : " If I am not there , take anyone in the street , the poorest if possible , give him my 100 lecture fee , and talk with him of images and sound , and you will learn from him much more than from me because it is the poor people who are really inventing the language . Yours anonymously , Godard . " <P> Who but a lawyer would ever try to make a case for the Mafia ? Luigi Barzini , for one . The Mafia " gives the Sicilians some sort of order in a country governed by foreign oppressors , " said the Italian author-journalist in a discussion with students at Los Angeles ' Occidental College . " The Mafia man uses the family and will not do degenerate things-he 'll have nothing to do with heroin or prostitution . " All of which leads Barzini to believe that Lucky Luciano , deported from the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was never really a Mafia man . " When I read in American papers that Luciano masterminded a drug ring and brothels , I know he is not Mafia . " In fact , noted Barzini with some pride , " the Mafia swindled him out of mil lions of lire . " <P> <P> " Jackie Onassis . Jackie Onassis , " mused Columnist Herb Caen in the San Francisco Chronicle . " It sounds funny , but we got used to Senator George Murphy and Governor Ronald Reagan . " For a week now , the former Jacqueline Kennedy had been Mrs. Aristotle Onassis , and the world and Herb Caen were beginning to get used to it . Still , though the initial stir of excitement had receded , there was no shortage of comment , much of it venomous . <P>
