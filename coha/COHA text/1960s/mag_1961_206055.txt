Since Detroit 's compact cars first began pouring into U.S. streets two years ago , they have been knocking off their imported rivals as if they were so many Los Angeles pedestrians . Total U.S. sales of imported cars skidded from a record 614,000 in pre-compact 1959 to an anticipated 375,000 this year , and import dealers have been run out of business in droves . But last week there were signs that the compacts had done their worst . In September the foreign invaders took nearly 9% of the U.S. auto market-their highest share in 20 months . <P> Bolstered by the knowledge that their customers of record 1959 will soon be back in the market for new cars , * foreign car importers confidently assert that their slide has ended , predict that their 1962 sales will bounce back up to 400,000 . But many of the 30-odd foreign makes that flourished in the U.S. in 1959 have been all but driven from the field . Only about a dozen foreign manufacturers , with lean , battle-hardened sales organizations , are expected to make money next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned some hard lessons . The most costly : never collide head-on with the U.S. compacts in price and size . Violating this rule all but finished the British Sunbeam Rapier and Austin , cut Hillman 's U.S. sales by 76% . With the solitary exception of France 's $2,250 middle-sized Peugeot-which is holding its own because of its reputation for high-quality workmanship-the successful imports are those that sell below the $1,800 bottom price of Detroit 's compacts or those specifically designed for the luxury and sports-car markets . <P> High &; Low . The British , who hope to increase their sales 25% in 1962 , are particularly mindful of the lesson . Five of the eight English automakers selling in the U.S. will soon introduce new models that do not directly challenge Detroit . British Motor Corp. , noting that 75% of its U.S. sales are sports cars , is coming out with two revised versions of its low-cost Austin-Healey Sprite ( $1,868 ) . It has also converted its tiny Austin 850 into the 90-m.p.h . Austin-Cooper mini-sports sedan boasting twin carburetors , disc brakes , and sure-footed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Humber ( 30% of its buyers are doctors , who like its luxurious interior and unpretentious exterior ) . <P> Continental manufacturers , too , are now shooting for the extreme ends of the U.S. market . Sweden 's Volvo has introduced the P 1800 , a powerful sports coupe selling for $3,995 . France 's Renault , whose sales have dropped 50% below 1959 's 90,000 cars , has chopped prices on its economy Dauphine by more than $200 , so that its models now range from a $1,395 version to a de luxe job at $1,595.
