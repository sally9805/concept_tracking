The Vikings are one of the most exciting teams in football . Scrambler Fran Tarkenton and the offense are fascinating to watch as they pile up points . The defense titillates in a different way  --  it usually lets opponents score enough points of their own to mess up the offense . Coach Norman Van Brocklin found the situation too exciting last year and quit  --  for 24 hours . The Dutchman is still around , the offense is still tremendous and the defense is as entertaining as ever . // Van Brocklin has a new five-year contract and the same old problems . They begin with the defensive line , which has been seriously overrated . End Jim Marshall allegedly was one of the game 's quickest pass rushers ; the trouble was that he seldom got to the passer . End Carl Eller was clearly one of the strongest of defenders , but he did not seem to be using his strength to any real purpose . Tackles Paul Dickson and Gary Larsen made no pretense of putting on a big pass rush , but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were not strong enough . // Deficiencies in the line left the linebackers frantic . Now Rip Hawkins , the middle linebacker , has retired , and Bill Jobko has gone to the Falcons in the expansion draft . Van Brocklin may have solved the linebacking problems with Lonnie Warwick , Roy Winston and John Kirby . Maybe . The secondary again consists of Ed Sharockman and George Rose at the corners and Jeff Jordan and Karl Kassulke at safety . // Van Brocklin hopes that No. 1 draft choice Jerry Shay of Purdue will win one of the starting tackle positions and that another rookie , Don Hansen , has the makings of a big league linebacker , but this may be wishful thinking . The Viking defense again looks vulnerable . Ah , well , there is always Tarkenton . In 1965 he not only completed 171 passes  --  only John Brodie , Sonny Jurgensen and Rudy Bukich connected on more  --  but ran for 356 yards . He racked up another thousand yards or so skipping around in the backfield looking for receivers and should do so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vander Kelen and Bob Berry , also are scramblers . // Minnesota gets powerful inside running from Fullback Bill Brown and a slashing outside game from Halfback Tommy Mason  --  when he is not injured . The battered knee which limited his activity in 1965 is said to be O.K. now . But Brown and Mason can not run all day , and their replacements are of the journeyman caliber of a Phil King . Much is expected from Jim Lindsey of Arkansas , the 220-pound No. 2 draft choice . // One of the reasons Tarkenton throws so often to his running backs is that the normal receivers are also rather ordinary . The best is Split End Paul Flatley . Hal Bedsole at the tight end has never reached his potential and is more valuable as a blocker than a receiver . Tom Hall , Red Phillips and Lance Retzel are not exactly feared as receivers , either . // The offensive linemen deserve gold stars for their patience with Tarkenton ; it is impossible to block scientifically for anyone who darts around the way he does . Tackle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vikings . He is a good man , too , as is Center Mick Tingelhoff . Tackle Erroll Linden went to Atlanta , and Archie Sutton and rookie Doug Davis are battling for his position . Milt Sunde and Larry Bowie are powerful , experienced guards . // Fred Cox almost never misses field-goal attempts from 35 yards in , and Bobby Walden is an excellent punter . // How Van Brocklin 's young players develop is , of course , important , but possibly more important to the Vikings is the development of the Dutchman himself as coach . His own background as a smart quarterback strategist has been reflected in the Vikings ' fine offense , but conceivably he has not given the defense as much thought and nourishment as he might have . " Maybe I wanted to get there too fast , " he has admitted . // Van Brocklin has done quite a bit of mooning over games that he might have won last season . " We wound up 7-7 , " he says . " If you took three plays out of 1965 we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last 22 seconds with a 48-yard pass . We had Chicago 38-31 with two minutes to go and let Sayers get loose for 96 yards . Against Green Bay we had two touchdowns called back in the last minute of a game we lost 24-19. " // Now Van Brocklin is unquestionably working very hard to solve his defensive problems and thus to make vain regrets over lost games unnecessary . " We 've got to improve the pass rush , " he says grimly . " I feel an air of determination here . We are capable of beating the best teams . We 've got to go out and do it . " // Unfortunately for the Dutchman , he has to do it in the NFL 's stronger division , against better , deeper teams . It is exhilarating to have him around , but his team may be no more than an exciting sixth in the West .
