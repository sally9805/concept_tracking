txt Washington Both President Johnson and the interna tional world now are faced with what amounts to an old problem greatly sharpened by new circumstances . It is the conflict between military and legal means to keep the peace . It now is posed ? first in Vietnam and today in the Caribbean ? in a world where military action can escalate into nuclear war , and where the legal issues are shrewdly muddied by the use of domestic " wars of liberation " tactics by the Communists . The President took a cold-war action in the Dominican Republic under the crude but established rules that have governed the cold war since its inception  --  and has managed to avert an all-out conflict be-tween East and West . He first used military force and then appealed to the weak and unprepared legal and diplomatic structure to support and justify his act . Aggression cloaked This was done by President Truman when the Communist North invaded South Korea . Mr. Truman won quick support from much of the non-Communist world at once , legal support from the United Nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be present and exercise its veto ) , and general support from world opinion as years passed and the issues were clarified . President Johnson is not so fortunate at the outset . The new difficulties faced by him are two : The Communists have become more clever in using internal guerrilla actions that do not raise an international legal issue . The President therefore had no clear-cut case of aggression , like President Truman faced in Korea , when fighting broke out in the Dominican Republic . He felt he had , to strike quickly , on incomplete evidence of Communist seizure of the Bosch forces , before it was plain that more peaceful measures would fail . He used force before obtaining sanction , on the ground that Communists might seize control of another American country in such a way that nothing could be done later ? either by peaceable means or military  --  to get them out . Second , the non-Communist world has been growing increasingly restive at the very important political side effects of quick and arbitrary cold-war actions . Stern declaration They result , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or military regimes because these are " reliably " anti-Communist , over popular governments which are more vulnerable to Communist tactics and hence carry greater cold-war risks . This issue has been growing on the international world since the troubles in Cuba and in Vietna m . It comes to a head with the stern statement of President Johnson , under the pressurq of the moment and perhaps unaware of its full implications , that " the American nation can not , must not , and will not permit . . . " a Communist seizure of power in the Western Hemisphere . - The evidence of Communist actions in the Dominican Republic will be fully discussed . So , too , will the question of whether he had the right , first unilaterally and hoping for justification later , to act in the face of incomplete evidence . But the atmosphere ; n which this decision will be made is far more sophisticated than in President Truman 's day , or even five years ago .               @ @ @ @ @ @
