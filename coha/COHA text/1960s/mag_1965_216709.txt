The Gold Cup means to powerboat racing roughly the same thing that the Indianapolis 500 does to auto racing . The boats are the biggest , fastest and trickiest to handle ; powered by souped up 2,000-h.p . World War II aircraft engines , they scream along at speeds up to 180 m.p.h. , tossing huge rooster tails of spray 40 ft. high in their wakes . The crowds are the biggest-300,000 or more . And the prize is the richest-$10,500 , plus a new car to the winner . At last week 's 58th annual running of the race on Seattle 's Lake Washington , the sentimental favorite was a hometown hero : Ron Musson , 36 , who had won the cup for the past two years in Miss Bardahl . But his hydroplane was three years old , had not been running well since it was dropped from a crane last month . In the trials , Musson was fourth ( at 113.5 m.p.h. ) among twelve qualifiers-far behind the record-setting ( 120.3 m.p.h . ) Miss Exide . " Usually I try to win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just try and keep my boat from falling apart . " Putt-Putting Along . That was the trick . Five boats dropped out with blown engines or smashed hulls . But there was Musson putt-putting along at a mere 160 m.p.h. , keeping everything together and racking up points . Going into the fourth and final heat , Miss Bar-dahl was tied with Miss Notre Dame for first place , each with two wins and one second . Bang went the starter 's gun and off shot Notre Dame ahead of Miss Bardahl . Musson appeared beaten . But a fuel line burst in third-place Miss Exide 's engine compartment . The flames forced Driver Bill Brow to dive into the lake , and that automatically halted the race . The finals would have to be rerun As the boats maneuvered for the last start , Musson boldly flashed across the line in almost the same split second the gun sounded , getting a 50-yd. jump on Miss Notre Dame . No one even got close to him as he swept across the finish line at an average speed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win five cups to tie Gar Wood and then win one more for myself , it 's doubtful that anyone at any time can beat that record . " He is halfway there .
