In 1960 Bobby Richardson of the New York Yankees won himself a sports car and a pay raise with a record-breaking feat  --  12 runs batted in during the seven-game World Series with the Pirates . It was an extraordinary effort , out it hardly compared to the performance put on by another ballplayer in a single game on a midweek September afternoon in 1924 . He batted in 12 runs that day , to set one of the most remarkable records in baseball  --  one that still stands today , 39 years later . His name was James Leroy Bottomley , but everyone called him Sunny Jim . // There never was any mistaking Sunny Jim when he swaggered jauntily onto the field at Sportsmans Park in St. Louis during the 1920s . The rangy Cardinal first baseman exuded good humor , from the way he walked to the way he wore his cap  --  at a rakish angle on his head , the bill cocked high over his left ear . // Sunny Jim , happy-go-lucky personality notwithstanding , was one of the most feared hitters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 1922-1932 ) . In nine of those seasons he batted over .300  --  once reaching .371 , another time .367 . In 1928 he tied for the home-run lead with 31 and won the Most Valuable Player award . // However , the RBI record Bottomley set on that September afternoon was scarcely noted by most of the country 's newspapers at the time . The headline news the next day was the U.S. 's defeat of England in an international polo match on Long Island , with the Prince of Wales watching . // Wilbert ( Uncle Robbie ) Robinson was the manager of the Brooklyn team that day , and he was plenty concerned with what was happening . His club had won 15 straight games in a streak that had ended 10 days earlier . Brooklyn was only a game behind the league-leading New York Giants when Bottomley went wild in Ebbets Field on September 16 . From a more personal viewpoint , Uncle Robbie was even more upset over the record Bottomley was to establish that afternoon . For Robinson , as a catcher with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11 RBIs in a single game 32 years earlier , and he was extremely proud of it . // Bottomley warmed up with a single in the first inning that drove in two runs and a double in the second , good for one RBI . In the fourth inning two men were on base when Rogers Hornsby came up to the plate . The Dodgers were behind by four runs , and Robinson did n't want the score to get any worse . He ordered Hornsby purposely walked to get at Bottomley . The strategy was fairly sound , for Hornsby was hitting .428 and Sunny Jim a mere .320 . But Bottomley embarrassed Robinson by hitting the second pitch high over the right-field wall for a grand-slam home run . // When Sunny Jim came up again in the sixth inning there was only one man on base . He hit another homer , to bring his total RBIs for the day to nine . In the seventh , Bottomley got a single that scored two men and tied him with Robinson 's RBI record . Another single in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jim had been up six times and had three singles , a double and two home runs off five different pitchers . The Cardinals , of course , won easily 17-3 and , despite all the scoring , the game was over in less than two hours . That included the time needed to revive the field announcer , who had collapsed on his megaphone while the Cardinals were scoring four runs in the first inning before a man was out . // Uncle Robbie never forgave Sunny Jim for his performance . The next afternoon Bottomley stopped by the Brooklyn dugout to borrow some chewing tobacco from Robinson . Uncle Robbie chased him away , shouting angrily after him , " You 'll get no more chews from me . Do you know what you did to me yesterday ? You chased me right out of the record book . "
