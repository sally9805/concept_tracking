" According to an old saying , a fashionable woman can get by with just her pearls . " Recalling this , Marie Louise Schroeder Hosford Whitney , 41 , fourth wife of Multimillionaire Cornelius Vanderbilt ( " Sonny " ) Whitney , 68 , bravely fastened on the $500,000 string of pearls that had once adorned the throat of France 's Empress Eugenie and set out for her own party at the Saratoga Golf Club . Even Marylou , as she has styled herself ever since she got to like the signature on her oil paintings , admitted that the big pearls might seem " too much " for just an afternoon tea dance . But if ever a gal needed a lift last week , it was Marylou . <P> There she was , about to face the cream of Saratoga 's August racing community . Not that they did n't all know each other ; after all , it was the fifth party that Marylou had given in eight days . Nor was it because that , in honor of the Belmont Ball committee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an after-the-races tea dance . " There are so many cocktail parties , " Marylou said , " I wanted to do something just a little different . " The reason for the apprehension was that " they " - the Wideners , the Wetherills , the Vanderbilts and the Sanfords-would all want to know about " it " - the $780,000 jewel robbery at the Whitneys ' Cady Hill House just four days earlier . <P> Miserable on Champagne . The miracle of " it " all was that the thieves had missed the pearls , which Marylou had casually dropped into her bedroom dresser drawer . But they had n't missed much else : her diamond engagement ring , Sonny 's mother 's diamond necklace , ruby and sapphire pins , even the turquoise owl pin that Marylou recalled sadly was " the first thing Sonny ever gave me . " Even more maddening , there were no clues . Five of the six servants had taken off the night of the theft ; the butler had locked every door but the front one . As the police pointed out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marylou discovered the theft just before going out to a dinner in honor of the Philadelphia Orchestra , which is playing at this year 's Saratoga Performing Arts Center , one of Sonny 's pet projects . She went to get her jewel box , stashed away between blankets in the linen closet ( " one of my four secret places , " she says ) , and discovered the jewels were missing . " I had to go through the whole party without anybody knowing , " she recalls . " I drank lots of champagne and tried to look happy . But I felt miserable . "
