Of all the Asian nations affected by Peking 's nuclear explosion , India has the most to fear . Since Red China 's humiliating walk through the Himalayas in 1962 , the Indians have been obsessed by fear of renewed Communist aggression . Thus , though India was only recently the anti-nuclear Cassandra of the nonaligned world , the nation last week was earnestly debating whether to build A-bombs of its own . <P> Chief problem for India 's nuclear advocates , of course , is their nation 's deep emotional attachment to the principles of nonviolence , as practiced by Gandhi and internationally canonized by the late Jawaharlal Nehru . In a speech to students last week , Lal Bahadur Shastri , Nehru 's successor , loyally insisted : " We can not change our conviction because of China 's action . " <P> India 's scientists , who think differently , are confident that they can explode a nuclear device within 18 months . A Canadian-built reactor is in operation near Bombay , another is under construction , a third is on order . <P> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reactor products-notably the plutonium needed for nuclear weaponry-would be used solely for peaceful purposes . Dr. <P> Homi J. Bhabha. chairman of India 's Atomic Energy Commission , even maintains that the price is right . In a recent broadcast . Bhabha said that less than $21 million would buy a stockpile of 50 atomic bombs ; for an additional $10 million , India could build 50 two-megaton H-bombs . Western experts agree with Bhabha 's figures . <P> Disingenuously , perhaps , many influential Indians argue now that membership in the nuclear club would increase their stature in the eyes of the world . Frank Moraes. astute editor of The Indian Express , reasons that an Indian bomb " would be a moral boost not only for this country but for all the free countries of Asia . " And to underline Moraes ' contention . The Statesman observed that " only a few weeks ago Ceylon protested against the presence of nuclear-armed U.S. <P> warships in the Indian Ocean . But in the face of the Chinese outrage , Colombo is eloquently silent . " Few Indians , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in itself confer parity with China . <P> Communist airbases in Tibet are only 500 miles from key Indian targets , while India 's northernmost base is 2,500 miles from major Chinese cities . <P> Asked one skeptic : " What would we use to deliver an atomic bomb ? A bullock cart ? "
