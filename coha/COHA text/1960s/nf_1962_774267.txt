txt  | Borrowers , of course , should not be apologetic about asking for a loan . However the better the case they can make , the better their bargaining position for desirable loan terms . The farm records described below can be used as a basis for credit . 1 . The net worth statement . This record shows the equity of the farm operator and gives some indication of the size and character of the business . 2 . Historical income statement . This statement gives the lender an idea of how well the farmer has used his assets in the past . The longer the period , the more valuable the record . The principal and interest has to be paid back from income if the farmer is to remain in business . Lenders like to loan to progressive businesses because they become bigger and better customers in the future . 3 . Budgeted income statement . This statement shows the lender how the borrowed funds will be used and what effect they are expected to have on income . Lenders have every right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a statement for their own information before asking for a sizeable loan . As farming becomes more commercialized and capital requirements increase , farmers can be expected to adopt better business methods . A well thought out plan of expenditures and receipts can not fail to impress a lender . The authors know of instances where loans were refused when the request was first made . Later when the case was presented by the use of facts and figures the loan was granted . Lenders are not always informed about agriculture or they may not know the circumstances surrounding a loan request . Relevant data will do much to inform them . Many lenders are moving in this direction . The Farmers Home Administration has long required records as a basis for their loans . Commercial banks and other lending agencies are recognizing more and more the value of such records . Budgets can also be of considerable help to the borrower in helping him decide on the amount of money he will need and the  | length of time for which he will want the capital . In general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the life of the asset . In some cases , however , capital may be needed to make substantial changes in the farm organization . If a farmer is considering supplemental irrigation , for example , he may need to establish pastures and to purchase additional livestock and equipment . It may not be possible to trace the money which is borrowed to a specific asset on the farm . In such cases , a farm plan showing the estimated income over a period of years , both during the transition period and after the adjustments are worked out , provides a basis for credit . Such plans not only indicate the amount of credit needed but also the length of time for which it will be used . Shop for credit It is true , perhaps unfortunately , that many people are apologetic and diffident when they approach a lender . If one has a legitimate use for credit there is no ' reason he should feel this way . Lenders should be viewed as any other businessman . They have a product , credit , to merchandize . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy to lend . Consequently the borrower should consider carefully all possible credit sources and compare costs and terms . Depending upon the amount of money borrowed , interest can become a significant cost . The borrower should be familiar with the commonly used methods of calculating interest . The three principal methods are : ( 1 ) flat interest rate method , ( 2 ) interest on the unpaid balance , and ( 3 ) discount method . With the flat ' nterest rate method , a specified rate of interest is paid on the 1ginal amount of the loan . If $1,000 is borrowed for a six-month period and the interest rate is 8 per cent per annum , the total interest cost would be $40 . If the loan is paid in one sum at the end of the period , the effective rate of interest is easily enough determined . But let us assume that the principal is repaid in equal  | monthly installments over the six-month period . Because the loan is half repaid after three months , the average amount borrowed is one-half of $1,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 16 per cent interest rate on an annual basis . If interest is charged on the original amount of the loan , and if it is repaid in regular monthly installments during the life of the loan , the effective rate of interest is approximately twice the flat rate . Interest may also be charged on the unpaid balance . In this case interest is paid only on the amount owed . Let us illustrate by an example . Assume $1,000 is borrowed for one year with a 12 per cent annual interest rate on the unpaid balance . Assume $500 is paid at the end of six months on the principal and the remainder of the principal is paid at the end of the year . The interest would he : figure This would be equivalent to 9 per cent interest on the original amount of the loan . With the discount method , interest is deducted in advance . Assume $500 is borrowed to be repaid in one year . If the lender discounts the loan in advance at 8 per cent he will make the loan for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this method $40.00 interest will be paid . The relationship between the rate of interest and the discount rate is given by the following formula : figure it will be noted that $460 at 8 per cent interest amounts to $36.80 . Often loans are amortized . That is , the interest and principal are repaid in such a way that there is an equal payment each month or each year . When this method is used , the interest payment is  | high in the early years of the loan and then declines . The principal payment , on the other hand , is low in the early years of the loan and then increases . To determine the amortization payment , amortization tables have been constructed . Amortization factors are given in Appendix Table 1 . To find the yearly payment , the amortization factor is multiplied by the amount of the loan . For example , if the loan is $20,000 and the interest rate is 5 per cent and the loan is to be repaid in fifteen years : $20,000 X .0963 = $1,926 ( yearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found in Appendix Table 1 by locating the factor representing the intersection of 5 per cent and 15 years . The total amount of interest to be repaid is calculated : $1,926 X 15 = $28,890 ( total payments ? interest and principal ) To find the interest subtract the $20,000 principal . This leaves $8,890 interest . The term amortization is also used to refer to loans which have equal principal payments . The periodic interest payments are based on the unpaid balance . Under this plan the principal payment is the same each period but the amount of interest and , hence the total payment declines . This type of repayment plan is common in the farm mortgage field and is preferred by some institutional lenders to the type of amortized repayment schedule described above . Borrowers do not always realize the importance of the interest rate in borrowing . The effect of the interest rate on the total interest paid on a $20,000 loan amortized over a 20-year period is illustrated : figure  | Time also comes at a cost when money is being borrowed . The data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest paid 1 for a $20,000 loan at 5 per cent interest . figure Time may be worth something to the borrower . It may be desirable to pay the extra cost if the monthly or annual payments will handicap him too greatly ; he may need the flexibility that lower periodic payments will give him . For those farmers who are limited on capital a poor year may place them in a difficult situation if interest and principal payments are too high . On the other hand , the same farmers may desire high monthly or annual payments so that they can reduce interest charges . With short or intermediate credit it is desirable to be in a flexible position . Therefore , one of two conditions should be sought : ( 1 ) either the loan should be written for a long enough period of time for the borrower to meet any unforeseen contingencies , or ( 2 ) the borrower should be assured the lender is willing to make an extension if one becomes necessary . Many commercial bankers like to make loans for relatively short periods . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repaid in full when it falls due . However when the loan comes due , they have an opportunity to review the loan with the borrower . This may also be desirable from the borrower 's standpoint as it permits him to keep the lender informed . However when the borrower signs a loan and does not expect to repay when it falls due , he must have confidence in the lender and believe the lender has confidence in him . Such practices can otherwise lead to acute financial embarrassment for the borrower and can hamper the efficiency of his operation if the loan is called .  | Other things being equal , bankers like to have short term paper in their loan portfolios . Furthermore , commercial paper is not eligible for discount with the Federal Reserve unless it is of less than nine months maturity . There are basic reasons for this . For policy purposes it is desirable to keep our banking system in a flexible and fluid condition . Our central banking system , The Federal Reserve System , can then influence economic events more readily by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short term agricultural loans , however , comes from rigidly applying non-farm standards to farm businesses . Sources of credit There are many sources of credit available to the average farmer . The best source will depend upon the type of credit desired and the individual farmer 's circumstances . Some of the major sources of credit are described in the following paragraphs . Individuals . Credit sources may be classified as institutional ( such as banks and insurance companies ) or as individuals . Individuals are an important source of credit for farmers . This is particularly true for mortgage credit . Often a relative or friend is willing to sell a farm to a young man and permit the debt to be repaid over a period of years . Individuals may also be willing to loan for shorter periods of time although they are relatively less important in the short term lending field . This source of credit varies tremendously in terms of desirableness from an agricultural standpoint . Some individuals may have a good understanding of agricultural problems and may extend credit in accordance with the demands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on unrealistic credit terms . It should be recognized that most individuals have not had as much experience in lending matters as have the personnel of lending institutions . Also individual lenders may be dependent upon the interest and principal repayment for their livelihood . They may insist on shorter repayment periods . Too the lender may be unable to renew in case the need arises even if he  | wishes to do so . Institutional sources are more likely to have adequate financial resources to permit renewals if they believe they are warranted . The above should not be interpreted as disparagement of this source of funds ; rather , it is designed to draw attention to some of the important characteristics of individuals as a source of capital . Institutional sources . Institutional sources can be categorized as public or government , cooperative , and private . Examples of these are given below : figure The above lists are not complete , but the classification will be helpful in the discussion of the principal sources . Public sources . At various times in recent history both state and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these programs have been of an emergency nature . These programs came into being during drought or depression periods , or both . Out of the depression of the 1930 's came the Farm Security Administration . The Farm Security Administration was created to provide a source of credit to those farmers who could not obtain credit elsewhere . In 1946 the Farmers Home Administration was created . It took over the functions of the Farm Security Administration and some of the emergency programs still in existence at that time . The purpose of the Farmers Home Administration was to make both long and short term credit available to specific groups of farmers . The act creating the agency also provided for the insurance by the Federal government of loans by private institutions to farmers if these loans had the same terms as those of the Farmers Home Ad-  | ministration . Farmers considering the Farmers Home Administration as a source of credit should be aware of two principal characteristics . First , to be eligible the borrower must be unable to obtain credit at reasonable rates elsewhere . Second , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This means the personnel must make loans they believe to be economically sound . Consequently they require that rather complete records be kept on the farming operation . They also provide considerable supervisory help in the extension of credit . The Farmers Home Administration has established many people in farming who have become successful . In some cases considerable emphasis has been given to the small , highly diversified farm business . While this may have been necessary in the 1930 's , modern technology has made many such farms obsolete at the present time . The cooperative lending agencies listed earlier are coordinated by the Farm Credit Administration which is a Federal government agency . The Farm Credit Administration is not a lending agency . Loans are made by local cooperatives . Consequently a mixture of cooperative and government activity exists . The government capital that was used to help create the cooperative lending agencies has largely been retired . The local Federal Land Bank associations extend long term mortgage credit . They make amortized loans available for rather long periods and their interest rates are usually as low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appraisals are usually quite conservative however , and they may not be willing to loan as much on a farm as some of the private agencies . Production credit associations were created to extend production credit to farmers . The local associations are operated as cooperatives and are largely owned by farmers . These local associations have a board of directors who make policy decisions with respect to their local operations . The Federal Intermediate Credit Bank is also a part of the Farm Credit Administration . It serves as a link between the production credit associations and the nation 's  | money markets . That is , it will discount farmers ' notes submitted by the production credit association and extend them credit . It then sells debentures on the money market . The Federal Intermediate Credit Bank may also lend to farmer cooperatives and others . Private sources . There are also a variety of private credit sources available to farmers . Commercial banks extend the bulk of short term credit in agriculture . Some banks have well informed people handling agricultural lending . There is no question but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an agricultural community . Commercial banks , however , have a desire to keep their funds in liquid assets . This desire may be overriding with some bankers and lead them to insist on loans for a shorter period of time than is warranted in agricultural lending . In some parts of the country commercial banks are an important source of mortgage credit , so the inference should not be drawn that they limit their activities to short term lending . Commercial banks will probably continue to be a major source of production credit in agriculture . Insurance companies are an important institutional source of real estate mortgage funds in agriculture . Agriculture is viewed as an investment outlet for the funds of these companies . In recent years they have improved their repayment periods , and their loan costs and interest charges have become quite competitive . They employ trained people to appraise and service their loans . They realize they are usually better off making loans where the principal and interest will be repaid than in foreclosing on the farm . Consequently they try to avoid over-lending and attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerable production credit to agriculture . Lending is not their primary business ; they lend to attract buyers or sellers as the case may be . Consequently they may be unable to extend credit for a long period of time . Also their interest rates may be rather high . In any case , interest costs should be checked carefully and compared with those of other credit sources .  | There are other private sources of credit . Loan companies flourish in most communities . These loan companies may not be a satisfactory source of credit for farmers . Often they attract the higher risk customers and suffer more losses . Their interest rates and loan costs usually reflect this fact . Even so there are farmers for whom the commercial loan companies provide the best source of credit available . Even though interest rates may be higher , the farmer may logically borrow if he has the cheapest source of credit available and if the productivity of the capital borrowed exceeds the interest rate . Here again careful checking of all loan costs is good advice . Public sources of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lend directly , or indirectly make credit available to farmers for production purposes , there are public institutions which have the effect of increasing the amount of capital in farming . Examples of such agencies are the Commodity Credit Corporation , the Rural Electrification Administration , and the Bank for Cooperatives . The Commodity Credit Corporation was created for the purpose of implementing government price supporting operations for agricultural commodities . Although it is not primarily a credit agency , the effect has been to increase the quantity of capital available to farmers . Of course total payments by the Commodity Credit Corporation to farmers do not measure the capital supplied to agriculture by the CCC . In fact it is much less . It would be less than the difference between what the government paid for the stocks and what the farmer would have received on the market if the CCC were not in existence . This difference represents an addition to the farmer 's income and a portion may be used as farm capital . If an agricultural commodity is eligible for a price support loan , the commodity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the announced level of the price support . The farmer then has the option of either letting the Commodity Credit Corporation keep  | the commodity , or paying off the loan and reclaiming the commodity . If the price remains below the loan level , the farmer will not reclaim the collateral . If the price should go above the loan level he can reclaim the commodity , pay off the loan , and then sell the commodity on the open market . Such loans are called nonrecourse loans . In the event the farmer does not reclaim the commodity , the Commodity Credit Corporation merely acts as a government purchasing agent . The Rural Electrification Administration is an agency of the Federal government created to make loans to cooperatives for the purpose of making electric and telephone service available to rural areas . The effect of this has been to change both the character of the home life of the farm family as well as to make electric power available to many farm businesses . During the decade of the 1940 's electricity as a source of power increased quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of increasing the quantity as well as changing the kind of capital on many farms . The Bank for Cooperatives is supervised by the Farm Credit Administration . Its name is quite descriptive of its activities . It serves farmers ' cooperatives in much the same way the Federal Intermediate Credit Bank serves local production credit associations . The Federal Intermediate Credit Bank may also loan to farmer cooperatives . Again the effect is to increase the quantity of capital in agriculture without extending credit directly to farmers . Corporation farming 2 Corporation farming is sometimes viewed as an alternative to family farming . Recent developments have made clear that it may footnote ' This discussion draws heavily on two publications : ( 1 ) Deon W. Hubbard , " The Incorporation of Farms and Ranches : A Technological Breakthrough in Agricultural ' Financial ? Legal ' Management , " Journal of Farm Economics , Vol . XLII , no. 5 , Dec. 1960 , pp. 1498 ? 1500. ( 2 ) Deon W. Hubbard and Grant E. Blanch , The Farm Ranch Corporation A Tool for Financial Planning and Management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1961.  | be a tool for maintaining family farm units . It also provides a means for some off-farm people to invest their money in agriculture . Because corporation farming has this effect on capital use in agriculture , it is discussed here although it obviously has numerous other implications to farm management decisions . The subject will be discussed with respect to : ( 1 ) Divisibility and continuity of ownership , ( 2 ) Liability provisions , ( 3 ) Tax considerations , and ( 4 ) Capital and credit use . It was pointed out earlier that one of the principal difficulties of transferring the family farm as a unit was its lack of divisibility . Incorporation of the farm or ranch unit is one way of meeting this problem . Shares of stock are created by incorporation and can be transferred by sale , gift , will , or passed by inheritance at death . Because these shares of stock can be transferred , it is possible to divide ownership of the farm unit among a number of people without breaking up the farming unit . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within a group if this is desired . This may be the case if the stock is held within a family . For example , an agreement can be made that stock will not be sold unless it is first offered to the corporation or to existing stockholders . A corporation is a legal entity and thus has limited liability . This means that it is responsible only for business done in its name and is not responsible for the obligations of stockholders and employees outside the scope of the corporation . In other words , losses are limited to the value of the stock of the corporation . This is in contrast to a legal partnership where liability is unlimited and claims against one partner may extend to all of the assets of the other . The advantage of limited liability may be offset if officers are required to endorse the action of the corporation for contractual obligations of the corporation . Legal action can also be taken against the stockholders rather than , or in addition to , the corpor tion . Space does not allow a thorough discussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some general consid rations can  | be outlined . The discussion will pertain mainly to Federal taxation because state laws are not uniform . The Internal Revenue Code was revised in 1958 to overcome some of the tax disadvantages of small corporations . Under this revision a corporation , if it meets certain requirements , can be taxed as a partnership . The requirements are that the stockholders not exceed ten all stock must be of one class , and-that all stockholders agree to this classification for tax purposes . If the corporation decides to follow this procedure , the income of the corporation is passed to the stockholders who report on this income individually . Otherwise double taxation exists because the corporation must pay income tax on its earnings , and when corporation income after corporation taxes is distributed to stockholders it is again subject to taxation . One way of meeting this problem is to pay officers in the corporation a salary for services performed . These salary payments then become an expense of the corporation and are not subject to taxation . The individual must report on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers must be for services rendered if it is to qualify as a corporation expense . The corporation also provides flexibility in transferring property to heirs . As mentioned above , the property can be transferred by sale , by will , or by regular inheritance procedure . It is possible for an individual to transfer a considerable portion of his holdings prior to death yet retain sufficient stock to maintain control of the corporation . There are obvious capital and credit implications pertaining to corporations . Because corporations enable off-farm people to invest in agriculture , the over-all effect is to increase the quantity of the capital input in agriculture . However the acquisition of equity capital through the sale of securities on the open market apparently has limited possibilities at present . Most farm corporations are not yet sufficiently large to justify the type of investigation required to create the necessary confidence on the part of investors who do not personally know the corporation . Ilowever the existence of  | stock which can be transferred provides for perpetual indebtedness , which is not common in agriculture at present but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both advantages and disadvantages in obtaining credit . The continuity of management and the opportunity of the corporation to be more adequately capitalized than the single proprietorship or the partnership may combine to enhance the credit rating of the corporation . The limited liability provision may work in the opposite direction by limiting the security of a loan . In any case , a lender may prefer to do business with a corporation which must keep a minimum set of records and which may follow more businesslike methods than other farm firms . It is obvious there are numerous technical and legal questions involved . Because of this complexity and because state laws are not uniform , legal advice should be sought by people desiring to incorporate . If the trend in this direction continues , attorneys will be forced to acquire competence in the special problems of agricultural incorporation . Incorporation is a technique for accomplishing specific objectives . In no sense is it a panacea . There are initial and annual corporation fees which must be paid . There is a considerable amount of " red tape " associated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ records must be kept in considerable detail . There may also be a tendency for corporations to be viewed less favorably than single proprietorships in the event of a jury trial . Corporation farming will probably play an increasingly important role in American agriculture . However it undoubtedly will remain far below individual proprietorships as far as numbers are concerned . Consumer credit Thus far the discussion has been entirely in terms of production credit . Consumer credit is also an important item to many farmers because the household and the farm business are often in conflict  | for funds . Certain principles apply equally well to both types of credit , yet there are interrelationships between farm and household management which make a brief discussion of consumer credit desirable . The household constitutes a constant demand for funds . Even at the extreme limits of frugality , groceries must be purchased regularly and periodic purchases of clothing are necessary , in addition to occasional expenditures for durable goods such as household furnishings . Other expenditures are made for the enjoyment of members of the household . Often only an arbitrary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmer is limited on capital , a household expenditure has associated with it an opportunity cost in terms of the investment which was not made in the farm business . It is clear that capital use in the general sense must apply to both consumption and production . Even an expenditure on a production item such as a tractor or a farm building may in part be for consumption purposes . Only in this way can some of the elaborate barns and fences in parts of the United States be explained . In planning capital use for the future the household as well as the farm budget should be considered . Many farm families are very much against going into debt for household purposes although they have no reservations about obtaining credit for production . No doubt this is a prudent course for many farm families although it may be unwise in some instances . An example will illustrate this point . Assume that the farm wife wants to spend $800 for a refrigerator and deep freezer . This may be a reasonable expenditure in that she may be preparing meals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by freezing , fruits and vegetables for winter use . However if cash is paid for these durable goods it may not he possible to purchase fertilizer for a particular crop . This fertilizer may more than pay for the interest on the loan for the refrigerator and deep freezer . If money can be borrowed to buy the fertilizer the problem may be solved . The family can say with pride that they did not go into debt for this combination luxury-necessity . Yet there is in fact  | no difference between this course of action and borrowing the money for the consumption item and paying cash for the fertilizer . Of course , going into debt for consumer items can have a detrimental effect on the farm business . If repayment schedules are not coordinated with or exceed farm receipts , the household may compete more with the farm business than if the debt had not been incurred or repayment schedules properly developed . The procedures outlined earlier for comparing interest costs and shopping for credit applies to consumer as well as to production loans . There is tremendous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size of the loan is small , as is the case with many household accounts , the cost of servicing the account , as a percentage of the amount of the loan , may be considerable . It is usually cheaper to arrange for the total amount of credit needed at some lending institution than it is to have several small accounts at a number of places . Careful planning and common sense go far in making wise use of credit . RECOMMENDED READINGS 1 . Black , John D. , at al . Farm Management , New York , The Maomillan Company , 1947 , chapter 32. 2 .

The characteristics of the land obtained and the way in which it is acquired will shape many subsequent farming decisions . If the farmer decides to buy land , the price paid and the size of the mortgage will influence his capital position and hence the type of farming organization he can develop . If he decides to rent , the kind of leasing arrangement developed will affect the enterprises selected and the way his labor , capital , and management will be used . The purpose of the material that follows is to outline some of the considerations involved in the making of decisions regarding land . To own or to rent ? From a farm management standpoint , land must be considered as a factor of production . It does , however , have certain characteristics that distinguish it from other factors of production . In the first place , it is durable . That is , it will not be used up in the production process although land may be depleted by use . It usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will respond in different ways to various applications of labor and capital . Too , existing institutional arrangements influence the use of land .  | The result of these characteristics is that land is well suited as security for a loan . It may be easier to borrow money with land as collateral than if other farm assets are used as security . Because a portion of the value of a farm can be borrowed , there is a temptation for the person with limited capital to buy land . This may leave him short of capital to use on other assets . His principal and interest payments may be too high in relation to income to permit him to reinvest in his business in a way that will allow him to develop the long run potential of his management ability . This " tying up " of capital represents one of the principal disadvantages of owning rather than renting land . Other things being equal , most people prefer to own rather than to rent . In this country a certain amount of prestige goes with owning land . Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improvement on something that belongs to them . Farm management analysis can determine if this satisfaction comes at a cost and , if so , to determine the amount of this cost . There is more of an opportunity to enjoy windfall gains by owning than by renting . If the price of farm land suddenly skyrockets , the owner will benefit ; the tenant may have to pay more for the privilege of farming such valuable land . By the same token however , the owner may suffer losses when deflationary conditions over which he has no control suddenly occur . Land ownership is usually considered to be a less flexible means of operation than tenancy . A farmer usually can expand or contract his operations with more ease when he rents than when he owns . The beginning farmer who is not yet sure of the best scale of operation may have need for this flexibility . Renting , of course , is not without problems . Insecurity of tenure is often mentioned as a weakness of tenancy , although this is not a necessary characteristic of tenancy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under leasing arrangements . It appears that both American landlords and American tenants desire shortterm leases and are unwilling to sacrifice flexibility to achieve secur-  | ity . However , relatively simple changes in prevalent leasing arrangements would bring about considerable improvement in the United States . Writing leases for a three- to five-year period , with a one-year notice for cancellation by either party , would give considerable stability to both owners and tenants without their sacrificing a great deal of flexibility . Most farm leases are oral leases for a one-year period . State laws vary , but a thirty-day notice is often all that is needed for cancellation . Compensation by the landlord for unexhausted improvements made by the tenant would remove some of the reluctance on the part of tenants to make improvements in land and buildings . Of course , for such a practice to be successful the owner should have the power of approving or disapproving the improvement that the tenant wants to make . These suggestions are discussed in more detail later in the chapter . Family living may also be less satisfactory on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Often a share of the crop or a fixed cash sum is paid as rent . The house and farm building expenses may be viewed by the landlord as necessary in getting land rented . If rental payments for land and buildings were separated , the buildings would become more attractive as an investment per se . However , if the rented farm yields a better net income than if the farm were owned , the family may be compensated in other ways for the sacrifice involved in living in a rented house on rented land . Some of the most prosperous farming communities in the United States have a high proportion of rented farms . Also , in some of the low income areas a large percentage of the farms are operated by owners . Obviously no general recommendation is possible as to whether it is better to own than to rent . This will depend upon the assets of the farm family , their preferences , the availability of land for both rental and purchase , and rental rates . From a farm management point of view the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , the way in which land is held should be viewed as a means to an end rather than as an end in itself . Only by doing this  | is it possible to separate profit considerations from other possible objectives of the farm family . Buying a farm Farm property is different from other forms of real estate in that it has a dual aspect to its valuation . Like other property it has appraisable market value , which is useful to real estate brokers , buyers and sellers , insurance companies , and in settling estates . Appraisal of market value is a highly specialized process and will not be dealt with in great detail here . ' The other aspect of farm property valuation is as a capital asset to the farm business . In other words , the land itself must be capable of producing a return in the form of profits . The farmer therefore must determine , regardless of its market value , whether the productivity potential of the land he is considering buying justifies its purchase . Of course real estate is only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and isolating its precise contribution to potential income is impossible ; within limits , however , the wise buyer can arrive at an intelligent approximation . Some assets , such as land , are long lived ; they will yield a return for years in the future . This future contribution must be taken into account and put into terms that can be used for present decisions . The process of bringing future returns back to the present is called discounting.2 Some rate of discount must be used in this process . The appropriate rate of discount is discussed later although 5 per cent interest is used here for illustrative purposes . Assume footnote ' Some excellent references on this subject are : James C.

It is necessary to have considerable information about the farm if the above method is to be used . Yields must be estimated on the ' This value can be obtained from Appendix Table 2 . The factor corresponding to ten years and 5 per cent is 7.7217 . If this is multiplied by $10 the value is  | basis of conditions expected to prevail on the farm . In organizing the information , appraisers take the viewpoint of trying to determine what an individual would be willing to pay for a farm as an investment . An illustration will make this more clear . Assume a 400-acre farm that will have wheat , barley , and alfalfa : figure Using estimated prices , the landlord 's gross income can be ascertained . It then becomes necessary to estimate the landlord 's expenses . Assume his share of the operating expenses , taxes , insurance , building and fence maintenance , and depreciation comes to $6,000 . The landlord 's net income is then $8,147.55 . Capitalizing at 5 per cent gives $162,951 as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of $407.38 . It is obvious the capitalization formula depends upon certain assumptions . The assumptions are : 1 . That prices and yields can be estimated with reasonable accuracy . 2 . That a realistic rate of discount can be determined . 3 . That income will continue indefinitely . It is apparent no one has the ability to predict prices accurately for a significant period into the future . Economic forecasting has not reached that stage nor is it likely to do so in the foreseeable future . Consequently , the choice of the correct prices to use in the capitalization formula is a difficult one . Some people believe long time average prices are the correct ones to use . Others argue that current prices are as good a guide to future prices as is available . Unfortunately , no easy answer exists to the problem . Long time  | average prices have the disadvantage that they do not reflect secular changes in the price level . Current prices are not always an accurate guide for the future . It is believed , therefore , that the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price assumptions . If it is believed current prices are such that they provide a good indication of the future , the formula may be worked using these prices . It can also be worked under more and less favorable assumptions . By varying the assumptions a number of values will be generated . The potential buyer is then faced with the problem of selecting one on which to base his decision . In the case of land purchase , the consequences of an unfortunate decision may be disastrous . As a result , the potential buyer may wish to be somewhat conservative and not base his decision on what he believes to be the most probable outcome . If this is the case , he will not buy unless the asking price is less than his estimate of the most probable value in his business . How much less the asking price must be if he is to buy will depend upon how conservative he wishes to be . Unfortunately no single rule is available to guide us here as this is a situation where individuals react differently to conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause less difficulty than prices . County yields can often be obtained as a starting point . Neighbors who have been familiar with the farm for several years can be interviewed . The local county agent may know the farm . Again , it may be helpful to use different yield assumptions to provide a range of values . It should be kept in mind that the adoption of better cultural methods , improved crop varieties , fertilizer use , and pesticides has caused yields to increase over time . Therefore , the objective will be to estimate yield levels that are consistent with modern technology and that the operator believes he can obtain on a sustained basis . The use of the appropriate rate of discount is also a complex problem . The current rate of interest may underestimate the productivity of the capital if the farmer were to use it in a different  | way . That is , the opportunity cost of capital may be as high as 20 per cent even though the market rate is only 5 per cent . The rate of discount has an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Had 7 per cent been used in our previous example , the value would have been $116,394 instead of $162,951 , a difference of $46,557 . Therefore , a budget may need to be prepared to estimate the return on capital if the capital were used in a different way . In addition to the above factors affecting land values , the secular increase in land values over time should be considered . Although the long run trend has been upward , there have been marked interruptions of this trend . Here again , the capital position of the potential buyer is quite important . He may or may not be in a position to gamble on the trend in land prices independent of what the land will earn as a part of his operating unit . The purchase of a farm is more than just another financial transaction . The farm family is probably purchasing a home as well as an income-producing asset . Consequently , there are other considerations that are not included in either the earnings or the discount side of the capitalization formula . After all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farm . The community in which the farm is located is important . School , church , shopping ; and recreational facilities must all be considered . The distance to these facilities should be evaluated . Anyone who has made an analysis of transportation costs realizes that an additional five miles from the local marketing center can make a significant difference in costs during the year . Many farms can be eliminated as possibilities on the basis of these considerations and the capitalization formula may not need to be used . The condition , design , and architecture of the home is important to the entire family . Most people do not " live to work " but rather " work to live . " Consumption is an important end in life . The house is the heart of the home and farm people have every right to consider it important . Of course , these factors will have to be balanced and compromises will have to be reached . For example , a highly  | productive farm that is a good buy otherwise may have an unsatisfactory house . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an excellent house for the family . The first farm might permit the construction of a house and the acquiring of the educational and health services that are important to family living . The second may lead to a stationary or a declining level of living . Perhaps the farm wife should be more concerned about soil quality than the condition of the kitchen sink . Renting land The leasing of agricultural land is an institution affected greatly by custom and tradition . While this custom and tradition has provided stability and has undoubtedly prevented gross unfairness , it can at times become an obstacle to better farming methods . Rental rates , established by custom , usually reflect long run economic influences . These rates are slow to change and reflect changed economic conditions only in a sluggish fashion . It is probably good they do not reflect every short run variation in the economic system , although when fundamental changes do occur , rental rates should reflect these changes . Lags may result in inefficient resource use in agriculture . Cash rent . Various systems of paying for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One method is by renting for cash . Cash rent has certain advantages and disadvantages both to the landlord and the tenant . Paying cash for land represents a fixed cost to the tenant which he must meet regardless of the yield or the price of his crop . The tenant therefore bears the risk of these fluctuations . The owner may , because of his guaranteed income , be willing to accept a lower rent than he would if he were receiving a share of the crop and bearing more risk . The tenant who pays cash rent usually has more freedom in making farm management decisions than the crop share renter.  | The crop share lease . The crop share lease is the predominant type of lease in many parts of the country . From the tenant 's standpoint its major advantage is that he does not bear the entire risk of price and yield fluctuations . This suggests its main advantage and disadvantage to the owner . It permits him to share in any extremely good years that occur , but he must also bear some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owner usually has something to say about the management of the farm . He may be unwilling to permit pasture crops to be grown unless they will eventually result in more grain production or unless he receives cash rent in addition to his share of the crop . The usual rental arrangement is that the owner furnishes the land and buildings and pays the fixed costs that are associated with these facilities . The tenant is usually expected to pay most of the other expenses and furnish the labor and machinery . This division of expenses and receipts can lead to inefficient resource use as is illustrated by Table 10-1 . An owneroperator would produce to the point where marginal cost is equal to marginal revenue ? he would apply 80 pounds of nitrogen . However , the tenant receives only one-half of the marginal revenue . Consequently , if he were paying all the fertilizer cost he would only apply 40 pounds . At 40 pounds his marginal cost of $2.00 is equal to his marginal revenue of $2.00 . The problem illustrated by the fertilizer example usually comes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When use of fertilizer was first being adopted , there was reluctance on the part of many tenants to apply it in the quantity desired by landowners . The present practice with crop share leases is for the landowner to share in fertilizer cost in the same way in which he shares in the crop . This same reluctance of tenants operating under crop share leases can be expected when the cost of any new technique is reflected mainly in operating costs . When landowners recognize this there will be a tendency for them to share in the variable costs . In this way the terms of the lease come to reflect changed economic conditions .  | figure Fixed product rent . Some farm management specialists believe that a fixed product rent would not have many of the objections associated with cash and crop share renting . With such an arrangement rent is paid in cash . The amount of the cash rent is determined by multiplying prevailing prices times a share of the long term yield . For example , assume that the crop is wheat . The landlord and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reasonable yield and that the landlord 's share should be one-third . If wheat at harvest time is $1.50 per bushel the landowner would receive a cash payment of $15 per acre . If wheat is $2.00 per bushel he would receive $20 per acre or $10 per acre if the price is $1.00 per bushel . This arrangement places yield risk on the tenant and part of the price risk on the landowner . Its principal advantage is that it rewards the tenant for superior management . From the landowner 's standpoint such an arrangement may be objected to because it fixes his rent on the basis of a share of the crop but he does not receive the commodity produced as rent . Some landowners operating under crop share leases like to store or sell their crop depending upon price conditions . Profit sharing . Profit-sharing arrangements can be used to ad-  | vantage in agriculture . Such an arrangement may permit a young man with limited capital to participate in a going farm concern of an efficient size . This arrangement may also permit the successful farmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work ? not just that which is invested in land and buildings . The stock share lease is similar in some respects to the profitsharing arrangement although there are important differences . The landowner and the tenant usually specify in advance what each will furnish and also agree upon a division of the receipts . Both usually participate in management decisions . Sometimes a provision is agreed upon that will guarantee the tenant a minimum labor income . Variations of this basic plan can be developed to meet individual situations . Profit-sharing arrangement and stock share leases can work only if the two parties have certain characteristics . Mutual trust must exist . Records must be kept and the terms of the agreement must be well understood by both parties . Not all people can work harmoniously under such an arrangement . However , with increasing capital requirements in agriculture there is need for leasing arrangements that will permit the younger farmer to acquire the use of farming assets . The essential idea is that the contributions of each party are valued in an agreed-upon manner and the product is divided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a lease would work is provided in Table 10-2 . In this illustration , the landlord is furnishing the land and buildings , part of the machinery and livestock , and the dwelling . The tenant supplies most of the machinery investment , half of the livestock investment , the operating capital , and his labor . In this example , the costs are shared in a 62:38 ratio . ( In the example it is assumed the management inputs are equal , therefore no entry for management is made . ) The way this works in practice is for a farm plan , much as the one illustrated , to be prepared prior to an operating year . In this way the rates of interest , depreciation , and the value of labor and investment can be agreed upon . However , it is not likely operating costs can be estimated accurately .  | After the year is complete , farm records can be used to determine actual operating costs . The essential idea is that the returns be shared in the same proportion as the costs . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gross income from the farm and the landlord would get 38 per cent . figure  | figure  | Improvement of farm leases Tenancy plays an important role in American agriculture . It permits many farmers to acquire control over more resources than would be the case if they were forced to own land . Certain undesirable practices and attitudes have developed , however , and much can be done to improve rental arrangements . Some of these undesirable practices and attitudes have developed because tenancy has been viewed by some owners and by some renters as a temporary condition to be endured until sufficient funds are accumulated to permit the purchase of land . It should be recognized that tenancy will , and probably should , be a permanent arrangement for many farmers . Some farmers are unable to accumulate sufficient capital for an efficient size farm during their lifetime if they are forced to own the land they farm . Therefore , if leasing arrangements can be developed that will promote more harmonious relationships between landowner and tenant , it should be to the benefit of agriculture . Barlowe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factors : 1 . The faulty knowledge or attitudes of either or both parties concerning their rights and obligations under a lease ; 2 . The income problem that arises when one party finds he must get along on less income than he had anticipated ; 3 . Inequitable rental rates ; 4 . Inadequate provisions for desired property improvements ; or 5 . A tenant 's lack of security as an operator . Many of the above difficulties can be overcome if the leasing problem is approached properly by both parties . With respect to the first point , a written lease developed through the participation of both parties , giving the provisions of the rental arrangement will do much to solve the problem . footnote ' Raleigh Barlowe , Land Resource Economics , Englewood Cliffs , N.J. , Prentice-Hall , Inc. , 1958 , p. 436.  | The second and third points are more difficult . Unforeseen economic conditions can - cause dissatisfaction on either side . It is sometimes difficult to obtain agreement on just what constitutes an " equitable " arrangement . With respect to the income problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would do much to show each party what can be expected under probable yield and price conditions . This planning can do much to prevent later disappointment . The same procedure will help in the determination of a " fair " or " equitable " leasing arrangement . " Fair " and " equitable " are subjective terms not capable of precise definition . However , a rental arrangement that is based on asset returns that deviate significantly from the economic productivity of those assets under prevailing market conditions probably will not be an enduring arrangement . Such a situation probably will result in one party 's realizing that he could use his assets to a better advantage in a different way . If the parties can agree in advance to the extent of completing a form such as Table 10-2 , later recriminations may be avoided . Compensation for unexhausted improvements was mentioned earlier in this chapter . One criticism that is made of tenancy is that soil depletion and property deterioration frequently result . If the tenant were assured , in the event he leaves the farm , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has made , some of his reluctance to make improvements might disappear . The landowner should have the right to approve the improvements before they are made . Assume a tenant remodels a farm building at a cost of $1,000 , and the landowner approves prior to the time the improvement is made . They agree that the improvement should last 10 years and that the annual rate of depreciation is $100 . If after 5 years the tenant decides to leave the farm , the landowner then will compensate him for the unused portion of the improvement , in this case $500 . The provision need not apply only to buildings but it can be used for soil building practices as well . Difficulties may be encountered in determining the portion of the asset which  | is unused . Such difficulties do not appear insurmountable assuming they are approached by reasonable people seeking a solution to a common problem . The lack of security the tenant has as an operator would undoubtedly be less of a problem if the provisions already discussed were followed . Leases that are thoroughly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationships between owners and tenants . An understanding of the contributions being made by the other party to the understanding and agreement on the rates of return to the various assets help in the establishment of permanent relationships . Finally , compensation for unexhausted improvements would encourage long run investments by tenants . Finally a word of defense is offered for the system of tenancy prevailing in the United States . The effects of such a system are not all bad . Undoubtedly one of the reasons for short term leases and insecurity of tenure has been the desire of tenants to improve their lot . Such a system permits flexibility in that the tenant is relatively free to rent a better farm or to buy a farm . It is logical that a mobile , fast moving society that places rather high value on land ownership would emphasize short term contractual arrangements . RECOMMENDED READINGS 1 .

This has been associated with a decreasing number of farmers . There is no evidence this trend has run its course . Because of this it is important to have size in mind when a farm is being acquired . Not only should the farm be sufficiently large for efficient operation , but it should also be capable of expansion under different conditions . Too , it is necessary that the principles relating to size be well understood early in the farm organization process . In order to make this complex problem manageable it is necessary to break it down into its respective parts . First the relationships of costs and returns associated with changes in size will be discussed . Costs and returns as related to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presented . It was pointed out that scale changes refer to the situation in which the proportion of the factors of production ? land , labor , capital , and management ? are held constant , while the quantity used changes . Scale changes are interesting theoretically and serve as the opposite extreme from proportionality problems such as those illustrated by Table 3-1 and Figure 3-1 where one factor is held constant and another is permitted to vary . In practice , however , scale changes  | are not normally encountered . It is usually not economical to vary all factors in exactly the same proportion . If land is increased , it may be logical to increase labor more or less than the amount that land is increased . Even if we tried to increase all factors in the same proportion it would normally be impossible because something would probably remain relatively fixed . For example , it often is not possible to increase management in the same proportion as other factors . For this reason we will discuss size in this chapter rather than scale . Size changes will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to change although not necessarily in the same proportion . In chapter 6 a discussion was given of various accounting measures of size . Some of the advantages and difficulties of each of these measures were enumerated . The basic difficulty of obtaining a satisfactory accounting measure stems from two fundamental economic problems . A measure of volume of output , such as gross income , not only measures size but also efficiency of production , consequently " confounding " results . Measures of single inputs , such as acres of land or labor inputs , assume all other inputs are in a fixed ratio relative to the measured input . For certain purposes these measures may be helpful . However , they are most useful if they are interpreted in light of underlying economic considerations . When discussing size it is important to have in mind the time period being considered . In the short run , say one year , it is not usually possible to vary all of the factors of production . Land probably will be fixed and it will not be possible to vary the amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hire more labor , cultivate more times , or intensify production in some other way . When a person is organizing a farm , more of the factors of production can be considered variable . If the farm is not organized in an optimum fashion from the outset , it is desirable to have an ideal . organization toward which one can work . Of course , new techniques of production and other changes may affect the optimum , but it is well to have some ideal size in mind at any point in time . On most  | farms progress toward this optimum size is made in piecemeal fashion , a step at a time . Even so , it is well to take a long run point of view when a farm is organized . In this chapter a long enough time period is considered so that.any factor of production can be varied . In other chapters the shorter run management decisions are analyzed . For most agricultural commodities , the number of producing farmers is so large and their individual production so small , relative to total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has no influence on price . Therefore , price usually remains constant regardless of the amount produced by an individual farmer . Total returns , then , vary directly with output because price remains constant . In turn , costs depend upon the inputs required to obtain different quantities of output . In chapter 3 constant returns were said to hold if the percentage change in production is equal to the percentage change in the inputs of the productive factors . Decreasing returns exist when the percentage change in production is less than the percentage change in the inputs , while increasing returns occur when the percentage change in production is greater than the percentage change in inputs . These relationships may be put in ratio form as follows : figure This viewpoint considers both inputs and outputs . It presumes all inputs or factors of production can be reduced to some common denominator . The only way of doing this is to convert them to dollars . When this is done , cost as related to output can be calculated . If output or production changes in the same proportion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same proportion . This will be true if the cost of the input , on a per unit basis , remains the same regardless of the quantity which is purchased . This is normally true in agriculture , although there may be instances where quantity discounts may be obtained . When the two change in the same proportion , constant costs hold . This may be put in ratio form as follows : figure Reflection will show that if the prices of the things produced and the prices of the inputs purchased remain the same , the inputoutput relationship and the cost-output relationship are merely different ways of saying the same thing . That is , increasing returns will result in decreasing costs , constant returns in constant costs , and decreasing returns in increasing costs . Consider the example presented in Table 11-1 . The percentage increase in costs is less than the percentage increase in output when output is increased from 10,000 to 15,000 units . figure Under these circumstances decreasing costs prevail . Cost per unit of output declines from $10.00 to $8.67 . Constant costs describe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per unit of output  | figure remaining constant at $7.80 . After 30,000 units , costs increase at a more rapid rate than output and cost per unit increases from $7.80 to $8.07 . Graphically this type of relationship may be shown as follows : figure Obviously the farmer producing in the AB range will make more profit by increasing his output . If he is operating at B , he can make more money by producing at C even though his profit per unit remains the same . In fact , it may be profitable for him to go beyond figure  | C. In order to understand this it is necessary to return to the marginal principle . That is , we want to increase production so long as the additional costs are less than the additional returns . If the price is higher than the average cost of production , marginal cost will be equal to the marginal revenue at some output greater than C. Factors affecting costs Thus far no explanation has been given as to why cost curves behave as described above . Later an actual farm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an actual situation it is well to treat some of the more general considerations involved . However , it should be understood that no one cost curve will fit all farming situations . Average costs tend to decline in the beginning as fixed costs are spread over more units . In operating a tractor , depreciation , interest , taxes , and insurance will go on if only one acre is farmed just as they will if 100 acres are farmed . In other words , costs will decrease until the most efficient combination of land , labor , and machinery is found . Quantity discounts may be a factor in some cases . In other instances a farmer may become a more efficient manager by concentrating on a sizeable volume of a particular enterprise . There may be several combinations that are equally efficient . That is , 320 acres of land that employs two men equivalents may be just as efficient as 480 acres that uses three men equivalents . This is the explanation of constant costs . Constant costs may prevail over rather wide ranges for certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labeled BC . Profit is increased by moving through this range because of the production of more units rather than by increasing the amount of profit per unit . If output is increased sufficiently , a point will be reached where some factor will become limiting . It may be the farmer is unable to buy or lease more land . To be sure , he may be able to increase production by irrigating or by applying additional fertilizer , but if  | land is fixed , costs will eventually rise through the operation of the principle of diminishing returns . Even if the farmer can acquire all of the land , labor , and capital he wants , his own management will ultimately become limiting . One of the reasons extremely large scale farming has not become prevalent in America is because of increasing costs . To say it another way , the efficient family farm is large enough to fall within the BC range . The above considerations raise fundamental questions regarding American agriculture . Over a period of time , larger farms make more money than smaller farms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farms would become larger they would necessarily increase profits . Even so , it appears that many farms could increase efficiency by increasing in size . Why , then , do small farms persist year after year ? How do they remain in production if larger farms are more efficient ? To answer these questions adequately would take considerable space . Only a brief treatment is given here ; in other parts of the book related points are discussed . Lack of knowledge may be an explanation of the behavior of some farmers . They may not be aware of the cost and return relationship as size is varied . This does not appear to apply to a large number of farmers , however . Farmers possess intelligence and many have acquired considerable education . It seems likely that these people would be able to predict with considerable accuracy the consequences of varying the size of their individual operation . Many farmers , of course , are not motivated entirely by profit considerations . For reasons of health , age , or other factors , they may not be interested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest profits . In other words , the profit associated with increased size is not worth the added effort to them . Others may be conservative by nature or have limited capital . In chapter 8 the impact of risk and uncertainty on size of operation was mentioned . Additional risk may be associated with increased size . Too , some may be unable to obtain the necessary capital to make the adjustments which they know would increase profits .  | A complete explanation of size of farm would also draw attention to the life cycle of the family farm . At a point in time some farms may be in the process of moving to greater efficiency while others may be declining . Neither should sight be lost of the fact that farmers are continuously adjusting to new economic conditions . New technology has constantly increased the volume of production necessary for efficient operation . As some farmers have adjusted by increasing size , others have been forced to adjust by leaving agriculture . Farmers are becoming fewer and farms are getting larger . Opportunity costs must also be taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor are particularly important to the part-time farmer . A cost curve that includes only money costs does not really describe his situation . If a part-time farmer were to reduce the amount of part-time work he does , his income might suffer even though he could produce more efficiently . That is , his opportunity cost would rise sharply . It may be that with the job he holds at present , he can farm in his spare time without interfering with his work . An increase in the size of his farming operation may mean that his off-farm work may suffer . We have many part-time farmers in the United States and off-farm work must be considered as they make their farming decisions . Recent research indicates that we may not have as many low-income farmers as was previously thought . Many have low income from agriculture but their main source of income is from non-farm employment . Cost-size relationships illustrated To illustrate cost-size relationships some actual data are presented below from the wheat-summer fallow area of Oregon . Wheat farming is usually highly specialized and serves nicely as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specialization may be somewhat misleading if the conclusions are applied directly to a highly diversified type of farming . After the wheat farming material is pre-  | sented , problems of size on multiple enterprise farms will be discussed . In order to develop the material on size-cost relationships in wheat farming a sample of different size farms was visited and detailed farm management information was obtained . Working from this information cost curves were developed relating cost to figure  | figure acreage farmed . The purpose of this research was to determine the correct amount of land to combine with different machinery combinations as well as to compare the efficiency of different farm sizes . Figure 11-1 indicates how cost of production per acre changes as size of the wheat enterprise increases . The basis and explanation of the cost calculations are given in Table 11-2 . A wheat farmer with a 30-40 h.p. tractor and supplementary equipment may decrease cost from about $55 to $35 per acre by increasing his acres of cropland from 400 to 1,000 acres . The same general relationship holds for a 50-75 h.p. tractor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 800 acres of cropland to only $37 if 1,400 acres can be farmed . Curve C represents a two-tractor outfit ; costs vary from $40 to $36 as acreage increases . There is no significant cost advantage in going from one large tractor to a two-tractor setup . The advantage of the larger acreage would be in having more acres on which to make a profit , rather than making more profit per acre . Of course , a second tractor adds convenience and flexibility to the operation . Curve D also shows that costs decrease as acreage increases . However , the curve becomes flatter as one goes to larger outfits . This means that costs are not reduced as much as acreage is increased for the two-tractor as for the one-tractor outfits.  | Figure 11-2 has been prepared to indicate an over-all relationship . This envelope curve was drawn from the shorter curves in Figure 11-1 . Costs decline quite rapidly from 400 to 1,000 acres of cropland . After this point , calculated costs per acre tend to level out and then to increase slightly around 2,200 acres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been reached at about 1,000 acres . After that , costs tend to first decline slightly , then remain relatively stable , and finally increase slightly . The reason for the cost increase is that more labor needs to be hired . It will be recalled that the cost of the operator 's labor is not included in the cost curves . Data were collected on farm size and production on all farms in the area for the years 1951-54 . This was done to get a picture of the situation prior to acreage control programs initiated in 1954 . These data are presented in Table 11-3 . Farms that have less than 720 acres of cropland are , generally speaking , rather high cost producers . Yet at the time of the survey they constituted about 50 per cent of the farms of the area but produced only about 15 per cent of the wheat . The farms with 721-1,440 acres of cropland have sufficient acreage to achieve many of the economies associated with size . They have the highest yields and produce approximately 30 per cent of the wheat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group with smaller acreages probably could lower costs by acquiring additional land . About 15 per cent of the total farms in the wheat-summer fallow area have between 1,440 and 2,400 acres of cropland . These farms have about 27 per cent of the cropland and produce approximately 28 per cent of the wheat of the area . Such farms have a sufficiently large acreage to achieve efficiency of operation . Some of the most efficient operations in the area may be found within this size grouping . About 8 per cent of the farms in the area have over 2,400 acres of cropland . These 8 per cent produce almost 30 per cent of the wheat of the area on approximately 30 per cent of the wheat acreage . Many of these large farms have  | sufficient non cropland to carry a cattle enterprise if they so desire . About 74 per cent had over 300 acres of non cropland. figure In summary , a few significant points should be made regarding Table 11-3 . We find about 50 per cent of the farms having less than 720 acres of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15 per cent of the wheat . A majority of the farms probably are too small to obtain the ultimate in efficiency . On the other hand , most of the wheat is produced on units with more than 720 acres of cropland . This is consistent with many studies on farm size that have been made in various parts of the United States . Large farms tend to make the most money , but , as was pointed out earlier , just increasing size does not necessarily mean profits will be increased . Too , as noted previously many small farmers have off-farm incomes and any increase in size must take into account off-farm work . Management ability , amount of resources , state of the farmer 's health , family situation , and the farmer 's attitude toward risk and uncertainty must be taken into account .  | Multiple enterprise farms and size of operation The material that has been presented on wheat farming illustrates some of the principles and economic relationships associated with size problems . It is clear that both proportionality and scale relationships are involved . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production can become limiting at various times in the process of expanding output . In the short run a farmer may be limited on land , but in the long run this can be changed . The kind and amount of his equipment may also be limiting , but this is also capable of change if the time period is sufficiently long . Capital limitations have already been discussed . Managerial limitations may be important , but an absolute fixity usually does not prevail . A desire to succeed plus the willingness to spend time and money in the improvement of the management factor can expand the potential of the management resource . The long run average cost is useful as a general planning device because it pictures the least costly way of producing different quantities of output . It gives some idea of the size of farm necessary to achieve the principal economies of production . Beyond this it provides a goal toward which to aim , even though such a goal may not be immediately attainable . However , it is well to recognize that most decisions are made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been made to farm , size is usually expanded until some limiting factor is encountered and costs begin to rise . As time passes and this factor is expanded , size can again be increased until cost again starts to rise due to another limitation . A great variety of factors actually limit farm size . Some of these were outlined earlier . The above discussion provides a background for size determination when a number of enterprises are produced . This is a highly complex problem since the combination , size , and method of producing a number of enterprises need to be determined simultaneously . If future conditions could be predicted accurately , it would be possible to develop a realistic system of simultaneous equations  | for the farm business . These equations could be solved with the aid of modern computing equipment . Carried to its logical conclusion , such a procedure would yield a precise answer as to what size of farm would be most efficient given the resources with which the farmer must work . But it is doubtful that such a precise determination would be of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would apply to a long run situation . Conditions will change with the passage of time and the optimum size farm would change . Therefore , the practical method is to approximate these relationships for long run planning and to become more precise when planning for short run decisions . In order to get at these approximations , cost curves can be estimated for individual enterprises similar to the curves presented in Figures 11-1 and 11-2 . One should not include enterprises in the farm organization unless they are to be carried on at a scale sufficiently large to permit the principal cost efficiencies to be achieved . An exception occurs with complementary and supplementary enterprises which are discussed in the next chapter . To repeat , an enterprise should not be included in a basic long run plan unless it is sufficiently large , under existing technology , to take advantage of decreasing costs . The same type of analysis can be carried out for those equipment items that represent a large investment . Fixed costs per unit of use decline rapidly as use is increased . Variable costs per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equipment can be used fully enough to provide for low unit costs it probably can not be justified for inclusion in the farm plan . Custom hiring or other alternatives should be investigated if the owned equipment can not be used efficiently . After a combination of enterprises is decided upon and an efficient combination of equipment , labor , and land has been determined , it is possible to vary volume and observe the effect on costs and returns . This can be accomplished by the use of budgets . It is well to keep in mind personal ambitions and goals in terms of  | income . If a person believes he will need , say , $8,000 spendable income annually to equal the level of living he could have in nonfarm employment , he can estimate the likelihood of this . He can determine the capital necessary to achieve this and formulate some idea of the time that it will take to build his farm business to a size that will permit this to be attained . Realistic , hard-headed planning at the time the farm is being organized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11-4 illustrates the size of wheat operation that would be required to achieve certain income levels . It indicates that if a farmer has his own capital he could have a net farm income of $20,537 by farming 1,600 acres of cropland with the price and yield assumptions used . On the other hand if most of the capital.were borrowed and interest and principal payments were necessary , his return would be reduced considerably . By studying the capital requirements in column four and his capital at present he can form a  | judgment as to the possibility of his accumulating this much capital . This type of planning can be done as well for multiple enterprise farms as for a specialized farm such as the wheat-fallow operation . The purpose of doing this kind of planning is ( 1 ) to establish farms of a sufficient size so that they will have reasonable prospects of success , and ( 2 ) to compare personal goals of income and capital accumulation of farm and non-farm lines of endeavor .

Physical , biological , and economic forces combine to determine the most profitable crops to be grown . Not only is profit important but stability of income must also be considered . When each individual adjusts to these forces on his own farm , areas and regions tend to form a pattern of production and often concentrate in the production of certain commodities . So it is with nations . Nations find their economic well-being is often enhanced if they specialize in certain products and trade with other nations for the other things they need . In order to understand some of these basic principles , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is followed by a discussion of individual farm management problems dealing with the selection and combination of enterprises . The location of agricultural production When one studies the location of agricultural production for the nation as a whole , he realizes that certain areas tend to specialize in certain commodities . The wheat area of the Great Plains , the  | corn-hog area of the Midwest , the specialty crops of the Far West and the East , and the dairy farms of the New England states are all examples of this regional specialization . Within each region , however , a variety of crops are grown and many different kinds of livestock are kept . Although the Midwest is famous for corn and hogs , we also find beef cattle , poultry , soybeans , fruits , vegetables , and small grains being produced there on a commercial basis . These production patterns are not absolutely stable . Shifts are constantly occurring as new forces enter the picture and change the terms of production and trade . What are the forces that affect the location of production ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this location of production ? When one attempts to analyze the problem , the need for principles becomes apparent as there is such a variety and complexity of forces at work . The principle of comparative advantage Perhaps the most important concept to understand in this connection is the principle of comparative advantage . To illustrate this principle we assume there are two farmers who live side by side but who have different soil types on their farms . Because of the difference in soils the yields of various crops are not the same . Suppose they can obtain the following yields of wheat and barley . figure Farmer Adams can obtain greater yields of both wheat and barley than farmer Baker . Assume further that both farmers have need for both wheat and barley either as feed for their livestock or for their family . Suppose that each fanner has 100 acres of land . Adams can produce either 6,000 bushels of wheat or 6,000 bushels of barley . Baker can produce 4,000 bushels of wheat or 5,000 bushels of bar-  | ley . If each were to put one-half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the following : figure To get additional production of 1,000 bushels of wheat , only 500 bushels of barley were sacrificed . But how does this look from the standpoint of the individual farmer ? Assume Mr. Adams is trying to decide if he should plant half his land to barley or if he should grow wheat and trade it to Mr. Baker for barley . He knows that in order to get a bushel of barley by growing it , he must sacrifice at least one bushel of wheat since the two yield the same on his farm . As a result , if he can trade something less than one bushel of wheat for a bushel of barley he will be ahead . Mr. Baker , on the other hand , knows that for every bushel of wheat he produces he must give up 17/4 bushels of barley . Therefore , if he can trade less than 1% bushels of barley for a bushel of wheat he will be better off by so doing . Under these circumstances , we would expect Adams to concentrate on the production of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would also expect them to trade one for the other at a rate somewhere between 1% bushels of barley to one bushel of wheat and one bushel of-wheat for one bushel of barley . Although the above situation is somewhat unrealistic , it does illustrate an important principle . This principle is the tendency of  | any economic unit ? whether it be an individual , a region , or a nation ? to concentrate on the production of those items for which their relative advantage is the greatest or their relative disadvantage is the least . This is the basic reason economic units specialize and trade . Factors affecting location In the preceding example the principal factor affecting productivity differences was the soil . Actually , the soil is but one physical factor that affects differences in productivity between farms and regions . The climate , the topography , and distance ( which is reflected in transportation cost ) are all examples of physical factors which help determine where something will be produced . Biological factors such as insects , plant diseases , and weeds are also important determinants of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevent a crop from being grown . They can be controlled only at a cost . Obviously , economic considerations influence where products are produced or even if they are produced at all . A demand must exist so that a product will be taken from the market . In this connection it may be helpful to classify the forces into two main categories . One classification affects the yield or production forthcoming from a given land area from inputs of land and capital . Physical and biological forces combine to set limits on this physical response . New techniques change this physical response from time to time . On the other hand relative prices and costs reflect economic forces . Population , incomes , and tastes influence the location of production over time . For example , the growth of population and income on the West Coast has made possible the production of a greater diversity of agricultural commodities than would otherwise be the case . Human , institutional , and social elements may also play a role in the location of production . The production of certain commodities  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case if location were determined solely on the basis of physical , biological or economic grounds . Hops and mushrooms provide examples . In other words , someone may initiate the production of a commodity in an area because of his background or because of the institutional environment in which he operates . However , if the production of the commodity is to be successful , the biological , physical , and economic conditions must be favorable . The historical location of hops , referred to above , may have been determined by institutional or social forces , but the shift in the location of hops production in recent years is testimony to the fact that unfavorable biological conditions can cause production in a given area to become uneconomic . When the factors influencing production are viewed in this way , the production patterns that emerge in the various regions are better understood . Even though particular regions may tend to specialize in certain products , individual farmers may deviate from the general pattern . For example , a farmer in an area that produces considerable wheat may not grow any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also produce other commodities . Too , some areas produce a variety of crops , while considerable specialization occurs on individual farms . This is caused by differences in physical and biological forces within an area ; the individual farmer finds that he has a comparative advantage in some commodity and consequently specializes . The remainder of the chapter is devoted to a discussion of the selection and combination of enterprises on the individual farm . Enterprise relationships The proper combination of enterprises on a farm is influenced by the relationship that exists between and among enterprises . A different relationship exists between barley and alfalfa than exists between barley and oats . A farm forestry enterprise that utilizes winter labor will have a different relationship to strawberries than  | will a dairy enterprise . These relationships can be classified as competitive , complementary , or supplementary . Two enterprises are competitive when an increase in the output of one results in a decrease in the output of the other . They compete for or use the same resources at the same time . Barley and wheat can serve as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a 640 acre farm , one-half in crop each year . He can plant the entire 320 acres to wheat , he can plant barley on the entire acreage , or he can plant any combination of the two . Under normal circumstances an increase in barley acreage will result in a decrease in wheat production . The reason for this is that wheat and barley compete for land , for labor at about the same time of the year , and for the same type of equipment . Therefore , any resources devoted to the production of one commodity , wheat , must be taken away from the other , barley . A different relationship might exist between wheat and winter feeding of cattle . A cattle feeding enterprise that would utilize winter labor would not compete with the wheat enterprise for labor resources . The cattle might also utilize some straw . In this case , an increase in the size and output of one enterprise would have very little influence on the output of the other . Such enterprises would be described as supplementary . Supplementary enterprises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Complementary relationships exist when one enterprise actually contributes to the production of another . In this case , an increase in the production of one enterprise results in an increase in the output of another . A legume that stores nitrogen in the soil may result in a greater per acre production of a grain crop that follows on the same land . Complementarity would exist if greater production per acre resulted in more bushels of grain produced than if all of the land produced grain year after year . Of course , a limit would exist as to the amount of the legume that could be grown before total grain production started to decline . The existence of complementarity and supplementarity usually depends upon the size of the  | enterprise . Most enterprises will become competitive with other enterprises if they are expanded sufficiently . In Table 12-1 , these relationships are illustrated by means of hypothetical data . figure  | From the table it will be noted that increasing barley production resulted in lower wheat production . This illustrates competition between enterprises . However , adding or increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence on the production of wheat . A different situation exists between wheat and alfalfa . By putting 80 acres of land in alfalfa , total wheat production was increased from 6,400 to 7,200 bushels . Putting 160 acres in alfalfa , however , reduced wheat production to 4,800 bushels . To say it another way , by putting 160 acres in alfalfa , alfalfa ceased to be complementary and became competitive with wheat . Enterprises are seldom completely complementary . At some point they cease to be complementary and become competitive . The same is usually true of supplementary enterprise relationships , although this is not illustrated by the data . However , if the cattle feeding operation were expanded sufficiently it eventually would compete with wheat for certain resources such as capital or management , if not for land or the operator 's labor . Later in the chapter enterprise relationships are discussed as to how they may be used in farm organization . The proper combination of enterprises on the farm is a complex subject and we need to draw upon a variety of tools and concepts in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One of the age-old debates in farm management deals with diversification and specialization . The advantages of diversification have been extolled in the farm press and by some agricultural advisors for decades . At the same time , farmers have moved more and more toward specialization . Many areas tend to concentrate largely in the production of one commodity , such as the wheat and beef cattle regions in various parts of the United States . Even where there is considerable diversity within an area , many individual farms tend toward specialization . However , the old adage " Do n't put all your eggs in one basket " is still followed by some . On the  | other hand , " Jack of all trades and master of none " is used as an argument in favor of specialization by others . Diversification may be either horizontal or vertical . As commonly used , diversification refers to horizontal diversification or to the production of a number of commodities . Vertical diversification exists when many steps in the production of a particular product are performed on the farm . A producer-distributor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He may raise crops and replacement cows , pasteurize , bottle , and deliver milk to the ultimate consumer . A high degree of vertical specialization is exemplified by a dairyman who buys all his feed and replacement cows and who sells his milk raw . In recent years farms have tended to become less diversified both vertically and horizontally . Obviously there must be economic advantages to specialization . When some other firm or farm can perform a function more efficiently than the farmer , he will give up this function and concentrate where he is more efficient . There was a time when the farm was almost completely self-sufficient . A few farms remain in Some sections of the country which approach this even now . However , farmers have discovered they can have a higher level of living if they purchase their clothes ready-made , much of their food which may be packaged and/or processed , and most of their farm supplies . Purchase of these items permits them to produce a few commodities for which their resources are well adapted and in a volume sufficient to permit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can improve efficiency by concentrating on a small number of enterprises . One is that it is difficult for a farmer to become a specialist in the production of many things . If he spreads his management too " thin " he finds he is doing nothing well . Specializing in a particular commodity permits the farmer to increase the volume of production of that commodity . This enables him to increase profit per unit as well as to increase the number of units produced . In other words , as long as he has decreasing costs it will be economical for him to increase production . Any agricultural commodity requires considerable equipment or in-  | vestment . Often this investment is of a specialized nature . A farmer with limited capital may be better off to invest adequately for the production of a limited number of commodities than to equip inadequately for a large number . It may be possible to obtain some of the advantages of diversification and at the same time reap the advantages of specialization . An example might be the production of apples , prunes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the three . In this case , all of the fruit requires about the same type of harvesting , spraying , and cultivating equipment . Harvesting and spraying operations would come at different times of the year . Smaller equipment could be purchased because its use could be spread over a longer period than would be the case if a single fruit were grown . In this situation diversification would permit the operator to utilize his own labor over a longer period . Too , by lengthening the harvest period he would need to provide less housing for harvesting labor . Finally , more stability could be expected since fluctuation in the prices and yields of the different fruits would tend to cancel each other . This , of course , represents specialization in fruit production even though more than one kind of fruit is grown . Diversification , risk , and uncertainty In chapter 8 reference was made to diversification as a defense against risk and uncertainty . The measure was not thoroughly discussed at that point ; we return to it now because it has considerable relevance to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arguments in favor of diversification is that it reduces risk and uncertainty . The argument runs that by producing a number of commodities , there is a smaller chance of having a complete failure . If the price of one commodity falls , another may remain constant or increase in price . Or , a poor crop year for one enterprise , say raspberries , may be accompanied by a good crop year for , say , cherries .  | Let us examine this last point of view in some detail . Assume we have one enterprise , let us call it A , that over a five year period gives the following net income : figure We can see from these data that the enterprise has a highly variable income . There are several measures of variability that have been developed by the statisticians . One such measure is the range between the largest and the smallest figure . In our example the range would be $550 . Suppose we have another enterprise , B , that gives us the following income : figure This enterprise also is a variable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note that B does not vary with A. In years when A is high , B tends to be low and vice versa . If we were to combine the two enterprises , we would expect variability to be decreased . This is exactly what happens as we see from the figures given below . In combining the two we divided each by 2 and added the result . If we were adding an enterprise to a specialized farm we would have to  | reduce the output of one in order to provide resources for the other . We assume here the resources are divided equally between the two enterprises . figure Our range is narrowed to $275 . But let us consider what would happen if we were to add a third enterprise . It would be difficult to find an enterprise that would not vary with either A or B. Consider enterprise C which also has a range of $550. figure If we combine all three enterprises by devoting one-third of our resources to each we find : figure  | In this example , by adding a third enterprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But adding a third enterprise did not reduce variability as much as adding the second . Variability was reduced by 50 per cent in adding B to A. By adding C to A + B , variability was reduced only about 15 per cent . Exactly how this will work in an actual situation depends upon the variability and the degree of association of the enterprises being considered . It is possible , however , to make some generalization at this point . The amount that additional enterprises will reduce income variability declines rapidly after the second enterprise has been added , if the assumption is made that yields and prices of the various enterprises are neither positively nor inversely associated . The following graph will illustrate this : figure Underlying this graph is the assumption that the enterprises are independent ; there is neither direct or inverse correlation among enterprises . Given this assumption , by adding one enterprise to the original enterprise , or a total of two , variability is reduced by onehalf . Adding a third enterprise reduces variability by only one-third of the two enterprises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with agriculture will realize that prices and yields tend to be positively associated . This is illustrated by Table 12-2 . A word of explanation is needed for those who are not familiar with the correlation coefficients and who wish to interpret the table .  | Statisticians have developed a measure of the degree of association of variables which they call the correlation coefficient . This coefficient can vary from +1 to -1 . When the correlation coefficient is +1 , it means that two variables have a perfect positive correlation ? when one increases , the other increases in exactly the same proportion . If the correlation coefficient is -1 , the two variables are said to have a perfect inverse correlation ? when one increases , the other decreases in the same proportion . If the correlation coefficient is 0 , there is no necessary relationship between the variables . The prices reported in Table 12-2 are all positively associated . Yields also tend to be positively associated although to a lesser extent than prices . This means that in most cases we would expect variability to be reduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conclusion appears warranted that diversification is inadequate by itself for complete protection against risk and uncertainty in agriculture . figure  | The other argument frequently given in favor of diversification is that it permits complementarity and supplementarity among enterprises . In those cases where supplementary and complementary enterprises can be added , of course they should be . That is , if an enterprise can be added that will increase or leave unchanged the production of existing enterprises , it should be included in the farm organization . A farmer should diversify until all supplementary and complementary enterprises have been taken into account . A procedure for combining enterprises In the material that follows a procedure is outlined for the determination of enterprise combinations which provides a way of considering the relevant concepts and information that must be dealt with . This procedure is not a substitute for budgeting or linear programming ; rather it is designed to aid in determining what should be budgeted or programmed . 1 . List all enterprises to be considered in the farm plan and tentatively determine their relationships . A classification such as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentioned earlier that an enterprise may be supplementary or complementary to another within a certain range of production  | but become competitive if production becomes sufficiently great . ( See the example of wheat and alfalfa under the discussion of enterprise relationships . ) The determination of the enterprise relationships will depend upon the combination of the two that will likely be grown . For example , if alfalfa is to be grown primarily because of its nitrogen fixing ability or primarily to provide feed for cattle , the amount needed to accomplish whichever purpose should be considered when determining its relationship to corn and cattle . 2 . Select one enterprise that is believed to be the most profitable . This enterprise can be selected by the use of budgets or from analyzing farm accounts . In making this determination it is better to use returns above variable costs than it is to attempt to allocate overhead costs to the enterprise . ( See chapter 6 . ) Make this enterprise as large as possible in view of the existing resources . If it is grown under contract , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limiting . Supplementary and complementary enterprises should be added to this enterprise until they become competitive , since their inclusion in our farm plan here enhances effective use of farm resources and adds to profits . Moreover , they provide the bonus byproduct of reduced income variability ( or increased income stability , if you prefer ) , as we have seen earlier . 3 . Select the next most profitable enterprise and determine if its addition will increase income . According to the tentative classification in step 1 , this enterprise will be competitive with the one originally selected in step 2 . If it is truly competitive , its addition will result in a reduction in output of the original enterprise . Its inclusion will be determined by whether or not it adds to income . If it does add to income , it may completely replace the original enterprise . If this is the case , the enterprise that originally appeared to be the most profitable does not turn out to be so when enterprise relationships and available resources are considered . If the enterprise completely or partially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complementary and supplementary enterprises added  | at that time will have to be considered in relation to the enterprise now being added . Additional complementary or supplementary enterprises may be considered at this point . It is now possible to repeat the above procedure for other enterprises that are competitive with the main enterprises that are in the plan . Various combinations can be tried until the planner is satisfied that the most profitable combination of enterprises has been determined . 4 . Additional enterprises may be added to reduce variability of income . The planner can choose that combination of enterprises that gives him the level and variability of income that best meets his situation . Attention is called , however , to the fact that the reduction in variability declines as the number of enterprises increases . If two or three enterprises are already in the plan , the reduction in variability by adding more enterprises will likely be small . For the enterprises considered in step 1 , the following procedure might be followed . Corn might be selected as the most profitable enterprise for tentative inclusion in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as complementary or supplementary enterprises because of their rotational relationship to corn . ( Crop rotations will be considered in more detail in the next chapter . ) Hogs might also be added as being supplementary to corn . The next step would be to consider soybeans and cattle . Soybeans could be substituted in the plan for corn . This would have an effect on the hog enterprise as corn acreage would be reduced and feed would need to be purchased . The other crop enterprises would also need to be evaluated in relation to soybeans . Cattle could then be tested as a substitute for the hog enterprise . The final combination can be selected on the basis of the level of income and the stability of that income . It is obvious that with six potential enterprises and a number of limiting resources , the number of possible combinations becomes very large . Because of this , linear programming ( as described in chapter 7 ) has considerable value for problems of this kind . Even with linear programming , however , enterprise relationships must  | be considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example in chapter 7 , but it is possible to use linear programming also with complementary and supplementary enterprise relationships . Complementary and supplementary enterprises can be combined and treated as one alternative . Other techniques also exist for handling the problem . However , linear programming does have one advantage in this respect . By considering the requirements of each enterprise for each resource , it is often discovered that two enterprises may be competitive in the use of one resource but are supplementary with respect to another . In total , of course , such enterprises are competitive , but linear programming permits these more detailed relationships to be taken into account . For the reasons outlined in chapter 7 , many farmers will not use linear programming even though they wish to do farm planning in a systematic way . For these people partial budgeting appears to be the most practical procedure . The two methods would lead to the same result if all possible combinations of enterprises were budgeted . Of course , this would be extremely time consuming and laborious . However , the procedure previously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerably the number of alternatives to be budgeted and will lead to approximately the same results . To illustrate the use of the above procedure , a farm situation in an area where a number of commodities may be produced is considered . The farm to be planned has 210 acres of cropland , fifteen of which are irrigated . By use of partial budgets it is decided that a dairy enterprise would be the main enterprise . The farm is capable of producing feed for a sizeable dairy herd , but family labor limits the number of dairy cows to twenty-five . It would be possible to hire additional labor , but this would require hired labor during the entire year . This would involve either having a hired man " live in " with the farm family or providing housing facilities for a married hired man . After some calculation it is decided that it would  | be better to . add other enterprises than to expand the dairy farm beyond twenty-five cows . The dairy cows require that a substantial amount of land will be devoted to hay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cropland is utilized . Grass seed production appears to be a real possibility . This enterprise can be added without reducing the output of the dairy herd . Although the farm does not have a wheat allotment , fifteen acres can be grown without penalty and this enterprise will be a profitable addition . Oats and barley are needed for feed . In some years the entire production of barley and oats will be fed , but in the event production should exceed this amount they can be sold for cash . The farmer believes he can produce hay more cheaply than he can buy it and he devotes a sufficient acreage to hay so that he does not have to buy hay even in a poor crop year . Therefore , in most years he will be selling hay . Let us now consider the farm organization on the basis of gross income from the various enterprises : figure At this point considerable care must be taken in adding more enterprises . The farmer has a sizeable number already and his labor and land are fairly well utilized . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be added without adverse effect on the other enterprises . If the size of the dairy herd is limited by the amount of feed that can be grown with family labor , this labor probably would not be fully utilized during the winter months . The sheep enterprise would have peak labor requirements during January and February . The sheep enterprise will not compete with the dairy herd for feed because the sheep will utilize aftermath grazing . If the farmer has sufficient managerial ability to handle the sheep enterprise , it probably would be a good supplementary enterprise . Therefore , he  | decides to get a farm flock of 100 ewes . This enterprise will add approximately $2,800 to his gross income . It is highly unlikely further diversification would either increase or stabilize his income . In this case , the final farm organization consists of a main enterprise , dairy . Grass seed is supplementary to dairy and the small grain and alfalfa are complementary . Of course , it would be possible to expand the production of any of these enterprises to the point where they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enterprise is added because it is complementary to the grass seed enterprise and supplementary to the other enterprises . In order to have confidence in the final farm plan the principal alternative to this organization should be checked . In this case , the principal alternative would be to drop the dairy and expand grass seed production substantially . This would make possible the expansion of the sheep enterprise . If the systematic procedure outlined above is followed , the principal alternatives will be considered in the process . The above illustration has not provided farm budgets for every alternative . However , this would be done in practice according to the procedure explained in chapter 7 . The above paragraphs illustrate the type of logic that would be used in farm organization . At each point the reasoning should be checked with a farm budget . Every time an enterprise is added , the effect that it will have on farm income should be estimated . It may be that several plans will be tried before a final plan is selected . We can never be absolutely sure we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the alternatives thoroughly , we can be fairly confident of the final result . Farm organization and management may be better described as an art than as an exact science . Therefore , judgment must always be used . For example , the final acreage of , say , barley may not exactly equal the acreage that will supply the livestock with feed . This may be true even if we do not look upon barley as a cash crop . The size of our fields may be such that it is not practical to limit the amount grown to the amount that can be fed , or a slightly larger acreage may be needed to work out a suitable rotation .  | In developing budgets for the future , past records are valuable . If we know how costs and returns will vary if an enterprise is expanded or added , we can consider many alternatives quickly and easily . On the other hand , if past records are not available , it is still possible to construct a budget . Data and estimates from farm advisors and other solaces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that decisions are based on estimates of the future . A budget or farm program merely provides a systematic method of organizing these estimates . RECOMMENDED READINGS 1 . Bishop , C. E. and W. D.

Crop management Given the farm organization , with the enterprises fully determined , the management problems associated with the various enterprises can be considered . In practice , of course , there are frequent occasions for considering them simultaneously , as we saw in chapter 12 with the crop and livestock management example ; but here they are considered separately for the sake of detailed analysis . All the problems dealt with affect management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be concerned with crops , chapter 14 with soil and water , and chapter 15 with livestock . We start with crops because they are basic to most farm management plans . Most farms devoted entirely to livestock production must consider cropping as an intrinsic factor in feeding , and any change in the livestock enterprise may very well call for a change also in feed crops . Even so , the correct procedure for some farms would be to start with livestock production and adjust crop production accordingly . For the purpose of discussion , however , this chapter will consider crops the main type of enterprise , with other enterprises , if any , being incidental . Principles of crop selection A discussion of crop selection inevitably leads to a discussion of cropping systems and crop rotations . In this section crop rotations  | and cropping systems are discussed in general terms . In the next portion of the chapter a cropping system is developed for a particular location to illustrate the application of the considerations presented here . As used here a cropping system is a more general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to include crop rotations . The term " crop rotation " refers to one crop following another . Yet growing one crop continuously would be a cropping system if it is done according to a plan or to accomplish a particular objective . It is submitted that all farmers should have a cropping system . Whether they should have a rotation depends upon a number of factors . The advantages and limitations of crop rotations are examined subsequently . Rotations have been recommended for many years by agriculturalists , although recently the benefits of rotations have been called into question . The literature on the benefits of rotations is extensive . Among these benefits are the maintenance or improvement of organic matter , fertility , and soil structure . Rotations may also permit better control of insects , weeds , diseases , and erosion . For many years Corn Belt farmers have successfully used a rotation of corn , small grain , and a legume . In other areas single crops have been produced profitably on the same soil year after year . It is obvious the problem of whether a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it must be examined systematically if it is to be analyzed properly . This particular problem is made more complex by the fact that certain agronomic facts are not known . The possible benefits of rotations are now examined . Consider first the control of weed pests . Unless weeds are controlled it is impossible to farm profitably for any significant period of time . It is necessary , therefore , to determine the most profitable means of weed control . One way of doing this is to follow a rotation . By growing row crops , small grains , and a sod crop in rotation it may be possible to control the growth of most weeds . Another method of controlling weeds is to use chemical weed sprays . The  | main cost in many locations of controlling weeds by the use of a rotation is the opportunity cost of limiting the acreage of a highvalue crop . With weed sprays the costs are out-of-pocket in nature . The sacrifice in acreage of high-value crops if a rotation is followed must be balanced against the out-of-pocket costs of chemical weed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered in this framework . figure The contribution of a rotation to the maintenance of soil fertility varies by location . Legumes will fix nitrogen in the soil which becomes available for other crops . Legumes use other soil nutrients and these nutrients must be replaced . If legumes are being grown because of their nitrogen fixing ability the question must be resolved as to whether the nitrogen can be supplied more cheaply by the use of commercial fertilizers . Table 13-1 illustrates this point for a location in South Central Kansas . Wheat yields were the same when nitrogen was supplied by a commercial fertilizer as when  | sweet clover was grown in the rotation . Under these conditions the most profitable means of supplying the nitrogen was by the use of commercial fertilizer . It would be better to grow the sweet clover with wheat than to grow continuous wheat and not fertilize . The improvement and/or maintenance of organic matter depends upon the return of plant or animal residues to the soil . Yet figure the precise level at which organic matter should be maintained for most profitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been maintained for a considerable number of years on single cropped soils , but it is possible that yields will decline eventually unless the decline is offset by improved varieties or other cropping practices . It may be more economical in some cases to grow an occasional green manure crop than to follow a continuous rotation  | for the purpose of maintaining organic matter . Organic matter is often returned to the soil in considerable quantity through crop residue even if one crop is grown continuously . Soil tilth and structure are also related to the maintenance of organic matter . The water holding capacity of the soil and consequent crop yields may be affected by these soil characteristics . Until adequate agronomic information is available , it will be impossible to subject this problem to the test of costs and returns . Experiment stations are accumulating valuable agronomic information that relates to this problem . Obviously considerable time is required to accumulate the data necessary to conclusively evaluate certain practices . Table 13-2 provides an example of the type of information needed to evaluate the economic aspects of various crop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or exceeded rotation corn at all locations but two ? the pasture improvement farm at Albia and the Grundy-Shelby Farm at Beaconsfield . It was suggested that a possible reason for this was that the original level of fertility on the farms was low and when this situation is corrected , continuous corn yields comparable to rotation corn yields might be expected . With respect to organic matter content of the soil the agronomists have this to say : Many studies indicate tiat there usually has been a decline in soil organic matter and soil structure under intensive cultivation . Most of these studies , however , were made under conditions of low fertility . The rate of decline in organic matter and soil structure could be expected to be less when large amounts of organic residues are produced as is the case with correctly fertilized corn . And the limited amount of work that has been done under conditions of high fertility indicates that the organic matter level and soil tilth can be kept at satisfactory levels for crop production with continuous corn.l Rotations also have value in erosion control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rotation plan . The existfootnote Iowa Farm Science , Vol. 14 no. 9 , March 1960 , p. 5.  | ence of sod crops in the rotation may provide protection for the soil during certain months of the year . However , there may be alternative means of providing for erosion control . How effective these are depends upon the severity of the erosion problem . Some of these techniques are ( 1 ) strip cropping , ( 2 ) contour cultivation , ( 3 ) terraces , ( 4 ) diversion ditches , and ( 5 ) mechanical structures such as dams , spillways , and flumes . The economics of conservation is discussed in the next chapter , but crop rotations as a means of erosion control may or may not be the most economical way of achieving this end . Rotations , then , should be viewed as a means of accomplishing various ends . If physical and biological data are available for a variety of soil types and conditions , the relative profitability of various cropping systems can be compared . As mentioned above , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing number of research projects devoted to this subject . It may be necessary to treat various parts of the cropland differently if soil type or topography varies greatly . This may call for some type of land classification procedure . The Soil Conservation Service of the United States Department of Agriculture has developed eight land capability classes that are in wide use.2 These are described as follows : Class I. Very good land that can be cultivated safely with ordinary good farming methods . It is nearly level and easily worked . Some areas need clearing , water management , or fertilization . Usually there is little or no erosion . Class II . Good land that can be cultivated with easily applied practices . These include such measures as contouring , protective cover crops , and simple water management operations . Common requirements are rotation and fertilization . Moderate erosion is common . Class III . Moderately good land that can be cultivated safely footnote 2 Our American Land , Soil Conservation Service , U.S. Department of Agriculture , Miscellaneous Publication 596 , 1948 , pp. 15 , 16. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Water management is often required on flat areas . Common requirements are crop rotation , cover crops , and fertilization . Usually it is subject to moderate to severe erosion . Class IV . Fairly good land that is best suited to pasture and hay but can be cultivated occasionallyusually not more than one year in six . In some areas , especially those of low rainfall , selected land may be cultivated more than one year in six if adequately protected . When plowed , careful erosion prevention practices must be used . Class V. Land suited for grazing or forestry with slight or no limitations . It is nearly level and usually there is little or no erosion . It is too wet or stony or is otherwise not suited to cultivation . This land needs only good management . Class VI . Land suited for grazing or forestry with minor limitations . It is too steep , eroded , shallow , wet or dry for cultivation . This land needs careful management . Class VII . Land suited for grazing or forestry with major limitations . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Usually it is too steep , rough , shallow , or dry to be seeded to range or pasture plants . Class VIII . Land suited only for wildlife or recreation . It is usually extremely steep , rough , stony , wet , or severely eroded . If such a capability classification is available for the farm , it may be helpful in classifying land into homogeneous areas . The classification , however , is based largely upon physical factors and the most economic *copping system will not necessarily be suggested by the class description . It may be necessary on a given farm to work out more than one cropping system so that the variation in soils is taken into account . A large number of small fields should be avoided , because of the resulting inefficiencies in the use of machinery and because of the unused land in fences and turnrows . In view of the advantages of rotations in some areas and the desirability of specialization , mention should be made of the possi-  | bility of cooperative cropping plans among farmers . For example potato yields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grown in rotation with other crops . Assume that alfalfa and small grains are the logical crops in such a cropping system . Two farmers may combine their land for rotation purposes which will permit a reduction in machinery investment and enable each farmer to specialize more as far as management is concerned . This will mean that in some years each farmer will be farming his neighbor 's land . Cooperative rotation arrangements obviously are dependent upon a close working relationship among the participating parties . Yet they may be a means of capturing the economies of volume operation without sacrificing the advantages of a cropping sequence . When the cropping plan is developed , it should be viewed as a guide rather than as a blueprint or a " strait jacket . " New crops may be introduced to an area , price relationships may change , and machinery for handling certain crops may be improved . These and other possible factors may make a revision of the cropping program advisable in order to take full advantage of the new conditions . A detailed cropping plan extending twenty or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in forcing the planner to think through the implications of different lines of action , but it is unlikely that farming conditions will remain sufficiently static to make rigid adherence to such a plan profitable . Even though it is usually unprofitable to switch crops indiscriminately in response to short run price changes , when it appears that the comparative advantage between regions has changed , the farm organization should be adjusted accordingly . In summary , then , the suggested procedure is to determine the principal crops in an organization as outlined in the previous chapter . The extent to which other crops will be included in the system should be determined by their direct contribution to the net income of the farming business and by their contribution to the main crops through insect , weed , disease control , fertility enhancement , and prevention of soil erosion . A cropping system can then be de-  | veloped . Such a system may involve either continuous cropping , a definite crop rotation , or a sequence of crops that can be varied within limits depending upon conditions at the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system for a particular location is presented . Development of a cropping system In this section alternative cropping systems are developed and compared . The problems encountered in a particular location are treated as a means of illustrating the procedures that may be used in actual farm planning . We turn now to the development of alternative cropping systems for an irrigated farm - in Central Oregon.3 The farm being considered has 240 acres of cropland with no livestock enterprise contemplated . The land is of a uniform quality which simplifies the problem because this is not always the case in actual farm planning . Under these conditions the farmer knows that he will have to include some high value cash crop in his cropping system if he is to obtain a satisfactory income from his farm . From his knowledge of the climate , soil , topography , and location of the area with respect to markets he selects three cash crops as possibilities : 1 . Potatoes 2 . Kenland red clover seed 3 . Merion bluegrass seed The farmer realizes that he will not be able to grow any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the yield and quality are adversely affected . Potato diseases can be better controlled when they are grown in rotation . They are a risky crop because of yield and price variability and have high capital requirements . Being a biennial , Kenland red clover must be reseeded every footnote a The situation analyzed here is taken from a Master 's thesis submitted to Oregon State College entitled Factors Contributing to the Success and Failure of Farms in the North Unit Deschutes Irrigation District , Jefferson County , Oregon , by Frank Conklin , M. Sc. , June , 1959.  | two years . It , too , is not grown successfully on a continuous basis as the control of weeds becomes a problem . A stand of Merion bluegrass for seed will last approximately four years . After this , weed infestation frequently becomes a problem . Alfalfa is also grown successfully in the area . There are other areas that can produce alfalfa more advantageously under average conditions . However , alfalfa may be a possibility as a part of the cropping system . Barley and wheat are small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular farmer is limited to 15 acres of wheat because he does not have a wheat allotment under Federal wheat program regulations . Cropping systems can now be developed that take the above considerations into account . Upon study it is found that most farmers who grow potatoes also grow alfalfa and grain . On this basis we develop two sequences that will utilize these crops : figure With the above rotations grain can be seeded in the fall after potatoes are harvested and reseeded the following spring if winterkilled . Alfalfa can be seeded with grain as a nurse crop thus permitting a saving of time over seeding after grain has been harvested . No problem is encountered in following alfalfa with potatoes . Kenland red clover for seed production might occupy about the  | same role as alfalfa in a rotation . On this basis it is possible to develop a third rotation as a possibility : figure Thus far no rotation has been developed to include Merion bluegrass . Rotation 4 accomplishes this : figure We note that no legume is included in this rotation . Nitrogen will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cropping pattern could be followed for a relatively long period of time without detrimental effect on the soil . Additional crops could be added to any of the above rotations . However , the acreage in any one crop would become quite small if additional crops were added . Even with the above rotations there are crops grown on as few as 40 acres which approach the minimum size needed for low cost operation with modern machinery and equipment . The farmer may then decide to develop a rotation for consideration that will permit greater specialization : figure The next step involves a comparison of cropping systems with respect to profitability . This will make necessary the preparation of  | enterprise budgets , which will require estimates of yields and prices for each of the crops in order to obtain gross income figures for each crop . Variable costs of production are subtracted from these gross income figures . Variable costs include fertilizer , seed , crop supplies , irrigation water costs , gas , oil , grease , custom work , machine rental , potato inspection and grading , seed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxes , insurance , certain repair costs , depreciation , and interest on investment would not be taken into consideration . The logic of deciding what expenses should and should not be included has been discussed in previous chapters . Once the enterprise budgets have been prepared they can be combined according to their respective importance in the various rotations . The results are presented in Table 13-3 . Rotation 2 provides the highest return above variable costs although there is little difference between this rotation and Rotation 3 . The table also presents information on labor requirements which may be valuable . The hourly labor requirements per acre are given for each month of the year . By assuming the operator can work 250 hours in any month we can see in what months hired labor will be needed . This problem is discussed in chapter 16 where detailed calendars of operations are presented . An analysis of capital requirements of the different rotations can also be made . The variable costs per acre were determined when the enterprise budgets were prepared , so it is a simple matter to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , Rotation 2 would have rather high capital requirements because of the eighty acres of potatoes . The farmer might logically decide to choose another rotation if he did not have sufficient capital for Rotation 2 and did not wish to go in debt to the extent necessary to have this rotation . The above procedure can lead to an approximation of the combination of crops that are the most advantageous to the farmer , given his particular combination of land , labor , and capital . The analysis can be carried to greater detail if he desires . For example , in areas where yields fluctuate considerably he may wish to make  | figure different assumptions about yield levels and determine the effect these would have on the profitability of various cropping systems . This would be particularly important with an enterprise such as potatoes where both prices and yields fluctuate widely . Point where monthly labor becomes 250 hours 1.04 240 acres  | Certain characteristics of the various rotations will be noted upon study . The most profitable rotations all contained a high value cash crop . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of clover for alfalfa and a smaller acreage of potatoes in Rotation 3 . Rotations 4 and 5 were considerably different from 1 , 2 , and 3 . A significant point is that Rotations 1 , 2 , and 3 all have a considerable amount of flexibility ; it would be possible to . shift from one to another without difficulty . In other words , a definite cropping system could be developed , but the particular crops to be grown and the acreage of each could be varied according to conditions . It is submitted that this is the way a large number of successful farmers operate . They make plans and they have wellthought-out long run objectives , but their plans do not become " strait jackets " from which they can not escape . RECOMMENDED READINGS 1 . Case , H. C.

Jensen , Farm Management Economics , Englewood Cliffs , N.J. , Prentice-Hall , Inc. , 1954 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ management from soil and water management is largely arbitrary , and can be justified only on the grounds of effectiveness of presentation . It should be obvious that the two are closely related in practice . Problems of fertility , for example , are affected by the crops grown as well as by the soil management practices such as the application of fertilizers . In this chapter , those management decisions that mainly involve soil and water are discussed . The close relationship of this chapter to the one just preceding it should be noted . The economics of conservation Discussions dealing with conservation can become highly tech- tech.nical and can lead one deep into such fields as soils , farm crops , and agricultural engineering , to say nothing of sociology , political science d aesthetics . In this chapter an economic point of view is taken and soil maintenance and improvement are considered as means rather than ends . Soil is viewed as a resource that has the potential of contributing to present and future income . If fertility and erosion are examined in this light , many problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , shall we reap our harvest this year or postpone it until next ? A sharp distinction should be drawn between soil depletion and soil erosion . As used here , soil depletion merely refers to a re-  | duction in fertility , or nutrient level ; soil erosion means physical loss of the soil itself . Once soil is lost through erosion it is virtually impossible to replace economically . Although some soil eorsion can not be stopped entirely , in most cases it can be controlled by such measures , mentioned in chapter 13 , as tillage practices , type of crops grown , strip cropping , and terracing . In regard to soil depletion the situation is not nearly so grave . It may be economically feasible to supply nutrients to depleted soils by various methods . A time-honored tradition persists which argues that soil fertility should be at least maintained and preferably improved as a farm passes from one generation to the next . While such an argument reflects a commendable idealism , it is often apt to obscure the economic requirements of running a farm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to improve soil fertility will depend upon how the manager compares present versus future income . This will vary between one person and another , also with the same person between one time and another . There may be times of emergency , too , in which a farmer may have no recourse except to use up some of his soil 's fertility , deferring maintenance or improvement measures until the emergency is over . There is reason to believe , moreover , that there are many cases wherein conservation practices would be profitable but are neglected by farmers who mistakenly believe otherwise ; in this case it is up to educators to make the facts known . In any area where soil depletion is widespread , for whatever reason , a conservation hazard arises which may represent a social problem . Indeed there are those who feel that soil is a precious national resource , that soil loss will affect future generations , and therefore that current economic conditions should not form the criterion for determining the use of this non-renewable resource . Such a line of argument must , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the absence of economic criteria , what criteria will be used ? It is impossible to completely stop soil erosion , and if we wanted to maintain soil fertility some soils would not be  | cultivated . This is true because the nutrient level is higher for some soils in their virgin state than it is possible to maintain when cultivated . Second , it is doubtful that the majority of farmers or any other class of businessmen will , for any length of time , follow conservation practices that are not in their economic interest . A veteran soil conservation worker has said there are three reasons why farmers practice conservation : 1 . They do it because they have been told by someone they should ; such advice may come from soil conservation workers , county extension agents , or agricultural publications . 2 . They do it to " keep up with the Joneses " ? other farmers are following conservation practices so they adopt them on their farms . 3 . They do it because it pays . It was this worker 's experience that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be continued . Hence the farmer can be expected ? indeed owes it to himself as a businessman ? to use whatever data are available in determining his farming practices , so as to provide for him the economically optimum state of soil fertility . If the optimum for the individual falls substantially short of the optimum for society in general , some kind of public action may be necessary to make further conservation efforts and expenditures profitable for the individual . Such public action might include a change in tax laws , an improvement in credit arrangements , lower interest rates , or the institution of a cost sharing plan between ' farmers and the government . In any event , in a society where profit and prices determine the allocation of resources , conservation will tend to be practiced when and to the extent that it is profitable . Fertilization practices The principles underlying the optimum rate of fertilizer to apply have been outlined earlier . A farmer who is sure of the response he  | will get and who has considerable capital at his disposal will want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marginal ) cost is equal to the added ( marginal ) return . Farmers with limited capital will want to apply fertilizer to the point where the last dollar invested in fertilizer returns approximately the same amount as the last dollar invested in other ways . The interrelationship of crops grown and fertilization was discussed in the last chapter . Even though some farmers do not have specific information of the incremental response to be expected from fertilization , there are a number of guides to use . If a person will use services available , he can formulate fairly accurate expectations . If a soil is deficient in a nutrient , the crops grown often reflect this deficiency in some way either by coloring of the leaves or by " firing . " Published information is available which will permit interpretation of these symptoms . Most states provide soil-testing services to which soil can be sent for analysis . These laboratories will make fertilizer recommendations based upon their analysis . Such recommendations should be accepted with caution because it is difficult to predict yield response from soil tests alone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correlate yields with soil test results . The county agricultural agent may be a valuable source of information . He is a trained agriculturalist who is familiar with local conditions . If he does not have accurate information on fertilization , he may be willing to establish test plots to obtain the desired information . The marginal principle may still be helpful even with sparse information . Assume that test plots for a particular soil type in a community show the following results : figure  | If the cost of nitrogen is fifteen cents per pound and the price of wheat is two dollars per bushel , thirty pounds of nitrogen obviously would be profitable ( 30 X 15 ? = $4.50 ; 8 X $2 = $16.00 ) . However , it is questionable if sixty pounds should be applied . The added return would be $6.00 and the added cost would be $4.50 . Yet with meager data , the farmer may be unwilling to make the additional investment for the indicated return . Unless the tests were carried on for a number of years , different conditions could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the money spent on fertilizer might return more if used in a different way . If a person wished to gamble a bit he might decide to apply forty or fifty pounds instead of the full sixty pounds . Without the benefit of marginal analysis , however , we might arrive at a different set of conclusions . Suppose we were to analyze this information on the basis of averages . The problem might be approached as follows : If sixty pounds of nitrogen were applied , the additional yield would be eleven bushels per acre and the additional return would be twenty-two dollars . The cost of the fertilizer would be nine dollars ( 60 X 15 ? = $9.00 ) . Therefore , the average return per dollar invested in fertilizer would be $2.44 ( 22/9 ) . On this basis it would appear the full sixty pounds should be applied . It would be possible to carry this one step further . Suppose ninety pounds of fertilizer would result in a yield of thirty-seven bushels . The additional yield from fertilizer would be twelve bushels . Fertilizer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fertilizer would be approximately $1.78 ( 24/13.50 ) . On the basis of average return analysis , this would have been a profitable undertaking . Yet we know the last thirty pounds of fertilizer application would have been unprofitable . The added cost would be $4.50 while the added return would only be $2.00 . The above example illustrates the dangers inherent in average return analysis . Marginal analysis is a much more appropriate tool in such a situation . Marginal analysis is also useful in making economic application of data such as those presented in Table 14-1 . The data show the  | response of corn to applications of nitrogen and phosphate . Assume that the cost of nitrogen and phosphate ( including the cost of application ) is fifteen cents and twelve cents per pound respectively . The cost of forty pound increments would then be $6.00 know that six bushels of corn would be needed to justify the application of forty pounds of nitrogen and 4.8 bushels would be needed to justify the application of forty pounds of phosphate. figure The procedure for locating the most profitable combinations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because of the predicting equation used , a negative yield has been entered in the table with a zero application of nitrogen and phosphate . This obviously would not hold in practice ; the explanation lies in the fact that the best estimating equation for the bulk of the data gave in-  | accurate results at this point .. However , it is obvious that either forty pounds of nitrogen or forty pounds of phosphate would be profitable . Let us proceed across the row representing a zero level of nitrogen and varying quantities of phosphate . Because 4.8 bushels are needed to pay the marginal cost of forty pounds of phosphate we move to the right until that point is reached . We note that moving from forty to eighty pounds of phosphate , with a zero nitrogen level , gives a marginal yield of 5.6 bushels and a marginal return of $5.60 . Going to 120 pounds of phosphate with a zero nitrogen application would be unprofitable . Therefore , we now proceed down the column representing eighty pounds of phosphate with variable quantities of nitrogen being applied . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falls below six bushels which represents a marginal return of six dollars . This is the same as our marginal cost for forty pounds of nitrogen when nitrogen is fifteen cents per pound . When eighty pounds of phosphate is applied , the marginal return is $6.20 when nitrogen is increased from eighty to 120 pounds . The marginal return falls to $3.30 when nitrogen is increased to 160 pounds from 120 pounds . Obviously we would not want to apply more than 120 pounds of nitrogen with phosphate being applied at a rate of eighty pounds to the acre . We now must move in the other direction to find out if a heavier level of phosphate application would he profitable when nitrogen is being applied at the rate of 120 pounds per acre . By increasing phosphate from eighty to 120 pounds , we find that the marginal return is $8.00 . However , moving farther to the right gives a marginal return of less than $4.80 and moving down gives a marginal return of less than $6.00 . Therefore , the most economic combination of nitrogen and phosphate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices used . Thee data would suggest that 110 bushels of corn per acre could be expected if the conditions of the experiment were duplicated . The above illustration is presented to indicate an additional application of the marginal principle . It also suggests the necessity of considering the nutrient level of other nutrients when the applica-  | tion of one nutrient is being considered . Although such a problem is more complicated , the principle of marginal analysis applies , equally well to this problem as it does to the fertilizer problem presented in chapter 3 . Water management A few years ago irrigation was largely confined to those arid sections of the country where irrigation was necessary if intensive agricultural production was to be carried on . In such areas it is obvious that important farm management questions center around water management . More recently supplemental irrigation has been widely adopted in humid areas . As a result , water management is a subject of interest throughout the United States . Water as an input . In an economic sense , water must be viewed as another input similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simplest case it would appear the relevant principle guiding water application would be the principle of diminishing marginal returns . In some instances this principle applies very well to water . If a response curve to water can be obtained and if additional increments of water come at a cost , then the marginal principles outlined earlier obviously would apply . If a response function does exist , cost data similar to those presented in Table 14-2 can be helpful in determining the number of irrigations . The additional or incremental cost of irrigation drops considerably after the first irrigation . The reason for this is that the fixed equipment cost was allocated to the first irrigation . This is appropriate because once the equipment has been purchased and is in place , the cost for additional irrigations will consist of labor and fuel items . The returns necessary to justify an additional application of water can be estimated from such data . The problem , however , is seldom this simple . Response functions to water are difficult to come by . Time of application is frequently more important than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soil as well as the density of crop stand are important variables that interact with water in determining yields . As a result , the other variables must be specified or controlled if the results are to be meaningful . figure Another complication relates to the cost of water . On many projects water is sold on a per acre basis . A contract is made at the  | beginning of the irrigation season for the irrigation of a specified number of acres . The amount of water used per acre becomes irrele- , vant except for the cost of the labor necessary to control it . Under such circumstances the marginal returns to water are not as important to the farm manager as the amount of water necessary for maximum yields . In such a case , the water cost is fixed and labor cost is variable . This of course would not be true of those situations when water is purchased on an acre-foot basis or where water is pumped from wells . In such cases the marginal cost of water is relevant . The proper amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor because labor must be used to control irrigation water . To make the most efficient use of irrigation water requires more labor than would a less careful job of irrigation . If additional water does not come at a cost but labor is expensive , more water will be used than if the reverse were true . The farmer should view water and labor as substitutes and replace the more expensive input with the less expensive . For the above reasons the application of water centers more around the time of application than in the calculation of incremental costs and benefits for different quantities of water applied . Consequently , if a response function for water does not exist , the most promising avenue would be to use soil moisture measuring devices to determine time and amount of application . Of course , no general statement can be made on labor usage as this depends on the relative costs of labor and water . The most economic method of water application is an important question on many irrigated farms . Water application methods can be classified as surface and sprinkler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furrows , and controlled flooding . Surface methods generally rely upon gravity flow to distribute the water as contrasted to sprinkler irrigation where the water is distributed by mechanical means . From an agronomic standpoint any method that will make water available to plants in the proper quantity and at the proper time are equally satisfactory . However , soil and topo-  | graphic conditions and type of crop grown may make equally effective jobs impossible under some conditions . The various surface methods can be used for a variety of soil and topographic conditions . Sprinkler systems can generally be used except in hot , windy climates and on very heavy soils where the rate at which water is absorbed is so low that much of it is evaporated before it enters the soil . An agricultural engineer can be consulted for advice on alternative methods of supplying water on a given site for particular crops . Once the engineering alternatives are isolated , there is the economic problem of determining the least cost method of applying the water . Again , it is impossible to give general recommendations because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are , however , certain elements common to all problems . In general the original land preparation must be more extensive for surface systems than for sprinkler irrigation . With sprinkler systems only low spots need to be eliminated . Sprinkler systems require a sizeable initial outlay for equipment which may last from fifteen to twenty years . A pump may be needed to create the necessary pressure for sprinkler irrigation , in which case power costs must be considered . There are annual cash costs for each method . In general , labor need not be as skilled for sprinkler as for gravity systems . Also , the labor is less tedious and difficult . Maintenance costs are usually greater with gravity systems . If reliable estimates can be obtained from qualified engineers , a partial budget can be used to estimate relative costs . By checking with a state experiment station it may be possible to find economic studies for locations similar to the one in question . If the land to be irrigated is not the same every year , sprinklers obviously have greater flexibility and may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been increasing rapidly in humid areas where lack of moisture limits the choice or yield of crops . Tontz reports that " Irrigation in the 28 eastern humid states excluding Arkansas , Louisiana , and Florida  | figure  | increased a phenomenal eightfold in the decade ending in 1954. " 1 Supplemental irrigation provides flexibility in the farm organization , permitting farmers to irrigate crops if moisture becomes limiting late in the season . It also permits a wider range of alternative crops from which selection can be made . Table 14-3 suggests the reason for widespread adoption of irrigation . The table is based on records taken from farmers in South Carolina over a three year period . Not all of the farmers surveyed used irrigation every year . As a result , it was possible to evaluate the profitability of discontinuing the practice in years of heavy rainfall which was the case in 1958 . The net returns for a three year period ( column 7 ) was divided by three to obtain the net return for one year ( column 8 ) . Net returns increased for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the three increased . The explanation of this is simply that the returns from irrigation exceeded the variable costs of using the irrigation system and the added harvest costs . In other words , if an irrigation system is acquired , certain costs become fixed and must be borne whether the system is used or not . The last column of the table gives the return on the average investment in irrigation equipment . The return varied from 7.5 per cent , when cotton was irrigated one year out of the three , to 54.7 per cent for peaches which were irrigated all three years . One of the major problems associated with supplemental irrigation relates to capital requirements . Capital requirements for irrigation are frequently so large that the system of farming must be changed if a sufficient volume of business is to be obtained to justify the investment . Therefore , a host of new management problems are introduced with irrigation . What crops or enterprises should be added to the farm organization ? Should any of the existing enterprises be dropped ? Where will the additional capital be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it were invested in a different way ? In chapter 7 the use of budgets was illus- footnote 1 Robert L. Tontz , " Future of Irrigation in the Humid Area , " Journal of Farm Economics , Vol . XL , no. 3 , August 1958 , p. 636. it  | trated for analyzing a problem of this type . ( See Table 7-11 . ) After such budgets have been prepared , the farmer can decide if he has sufficient capital to make the necessary adjustments and if he has the management ability , interest , and technical knowledge to change to a new type of farming . Some larger problems of water . Water is becoming an increasingly scarce resource nationally . As our economy grows , more water will be required for industrial uses . Population growth requires additional quantities of water for personal use and recreation . Consequently , further expansion of irrigation may face competition in its claim on water . This is made more serious by the fact that irrigation is a high consumptive user of water in that much irrigation water can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many other uses . In addition , most , studies indicate that the investment value of water used for non-agricultural purposes is greater than that used for agricultural purposes . Water for the expansion of irrigation probably will come largely from the development of additional storage or the utilization of ground water sources . In such a situation , the farmer must be alert regarding his claim on water . He should protect his water rights by complying with the regulations of the state in which he lives . It is his responsibility to find out what these regulations are . Some of the arguments about the relative value of water in agricultural and non-agricultural uses are not well grounded . Overall comparative figures on water value may not be valid when applied to a particular case . For example , if water were not used for irrigation in central Idaho , it might not be used at all . On the other hand , the competition for water in certain areas is sufficiently keen that the farmer should be alert to the situation if he wishes to maintain or increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far crop practices have been discussed individually . However , when practices are used in combination , yields are often obtained that exceed those that would be estimated on the basis of experiments where each practice is evaluated individually . Statisticians call this positive interaction . There is evidence that much of the increased crop yields in recent years can be attributed to these interaction effects . For example , fertilizer , proper tillage practices , weed control measures , and plant population may be far more effective in increasing yields than one would expect on the basis of experience in using each practice individually . This phenomenon is illustrated in Table 14-4 . It is appropriate to illustrate interaction with water as one input , because removing moisture as a limiting factor opens up numerous possibilities for the utilization of other inputs . ( It would also be possible to describe positive interaction from the data in Table 14-1 . ) The yield with medium moisture level and 150 pounds of nitrate could not have been predicted on the basis of the response to water with nitrogen held constant at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis of the response to nitrogen with the moisture level held constant at the " dry " level . This physical phenomenon obviously has important economic implications . If a positive interaction exists , practices may prove economic when used in combination . This might not he the case if they were used individually . To put it another way , if crop practices are economic when used individually and there is reason to believe a positive interaction may exist , the economic return from the practices will be enhanced . Negative interactions may also occur . However , positive interactions are far more common with agronomic practices . Much of footnote 2 The 1263 pounds of seed cotton which results from the " medium " level of moisture and 60 pounds of nitrogen must be explained on the basis of experimental error . It can be ignored because it does not affect the point made in the explanation which follows .  | the increase in yields which was obtained during the 1950 's have . been due to positive interaction effects among crop practices . figure RECOMMENDED READINGS 1 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Principles of Farm Management .

Livestock management In this chapter attention will first be given to the selection of livestock enterprises . This is followed by a discussion of the operating decisions involved in the management of livestock enterprises after they have been selected . The selection of livestock enterprises In chapter 7 it was stated that in the development of a farm plan it is necessary to enumerate and evaluate the resources with which one must work . In considering different livestock enterprises , the effect each will have on the available resources should be studied carefully . The specific testing of profitability can be done by the budgeting procedures outlined earlier . However , a major decision relates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Obviously , not all alternatives can be tested in this way . Consequently , judgment must be brought to play in narrowing the list of possible alternatives . The land , labor , capital , and management resources will not be equally well adapted to all livestock enterprises . The one that is the most limiting will play a strategic role in the planning process .  | Use of principal resources On some farms land resources may be limiting . The farm acreage may be fixed at a rather low level and the possibilities for expansion may not be promising . Under such conditions , an enterprise that provides high gross income per unit of land input should be considered for testing by the budget method . Examples of such enterprises would be poultry , dairy , or hogs . Too , it is important to consider the capabilities of the land . Under such circumstances a cow-calf beef operation probably would not be budgeted . A possible exception might exist if a long pasture season is possible and the pasture could be irrigated . Even then a different enterprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The availability of labor resources also is relevant to a choice of a livestock enterprise . Dairy , for example , has rather high labor use throughout the year . The same is true of poultry and , to a lesser extent , of hogs . The labor needs of certain feeding operations may be more of a seasonal nature and may have greater possibilities for integration with cropping operations . The kind of labor is also important . The productivity of a given type of labor will vary by enterprises . Therefore the allocation of labor among enterprises is an economic question of some importance . With hog production , for example , the number of pigs per litter is an important factor in determining profits . At farrowing time , dependable and moderately well-skilled labor is necessary . Dairy production , on the other hand , requires year-round rather than highly skilled labor . The adoption of livestock enterprises of an efficient size may necessitate the hiring of labor , which may affect both the household and the farm business . Housing may need to be provided if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they are not married . When room and board are provided , there are obviously implications in the life of the farm family that must be taken into consideration . In contrast , in some of the more highly commercial-  | ized farming areas such as the milksheds of southern California , farm workers are unionized . A milker is trained and the wage is standardized . In such cases farm labor is more nearly characteristic of the labor in a factory or in a service station than is true of the usual farming community . Different types of livestock enterprises have varying capital requirements . Certain enterprises might fit a particular farm quite well in many respects , yet be out of the question simply because sufficient capital is not available . Obviously , such an enterprise would not be included in the detailed planning analysis . For exam-. pie , feeder cattle have higher capital requirements per $100 of gross income than a swine enterprise . With some enterprises , such as broilers , it may be possible to obtain nearly complete financing by contract farming . Finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be considered . Clearly , all enterprises are not equal in this respect . The old saying , " The eye of the master fattens the cattle , " implies that livestock care is an art . To the extent that this is the case the care and feeding of livestock can not be completely routinized and delegated . If and when it is possible to classify livestock production as a science , then operations will be routinized and entrusted to hired labor . This will make possible an increase in the economical size of herd or flock . As progress in nutrition , disease control , and breeding is made , livestock production will become more of a science and less of an art . The conditions under which poultry is grown indicate considerable progress has been made in this direction for this enterprise . Swine production can be specified and detailed much more minutely than it was possible to do a few years ago . Cattle feeding also is becoming more routine . Advances in nutrition and mechanization have also pushed the production of milk in this direction . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for evaluating the possibility of different livestock enterprises for a particular farm might be developed . The logic suggested by Table 15-1 can be fol-  | lowed . While the construction of an actual table may not be needed , the thought process involved may be helpful in eliminating unlikely livestock enterprise possibilities . The essential idea here is to determine the resources most likely to be limiting and to select the enterprises that make the best use of those limiting resources . If only limited land and capital are available , poultry will obviously be a more likely enterprise than feeder cattle . If labor is a limiting factor , feeder cattle would be a logical choice . The ranking in the table will not hold for all farms ; it is presented here as illustrative of the type of logic that may be used in the selection of a livestock enterprise . figure Table 15-2 illustrates resource requirements for a particular situation when various livestock enterprises were being considered for addition to a predominantly crop farm . Consequently , the enterprises are the minimum size required for an economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the sheep represent a  | farm flock . The cash costs include all costs except interest on investment , depreciation , and a charge for family labor . There is considerable variation among the enterprises in terms of cash costs as well as for labor requirements per $100 gross income . By developing a seasonal distribution of labor requirements , the compatibility of the various enterprises with the existing organization is suggested . It would also be possible to calculate land requirements by making assumptions as to the ration to be fed and the amounts of feed to be produced and purchased . Obviously such requirements would vary among farming situations as would the cash costs and labor requirements . When individual farm planning is done , care should be taken to obtain data that apply to the particular farming situation being considered . figure Risk and uncertainty Some livestock and livestock product prices have considerable price variability . These enterprises may be avoided by farmers who are heavily in debt or who can not afford a loss in a particular year .  | Neither are livestock enterprises equal in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as disease and weather do not affect all livestock enterprises in the same way . For the above reasons the risk and uncertainty associated with livestock production should be considered . One of the more important factors influencing the riskiness of an enterprise is the type of cost structure which is associated with the enterprise . Farm managers have recognized this for some time , yet it is often overlooked in farm management texts and by some professional workers . This point can best be illustrated by an example of the cost structure of a feeder cattle enterprise compared to the cost structure of a cow operation where the feeder is purchased . First consider a feeder operation : figure In this case the feeder can not be raised as efficiently as he can be purchased from another source . It is obvious that with these price relationships it would be more profitable to buy the feeder than it would be to raise him . But consider the situation if , instead of selling the finished animal for $25 per 100# , it can be sold for only $18 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ losing money on the operation . However , if the animal were purchased , there would be insufficient income to cover the cash costs that must be met on a year-to-year basis . The farmer would fail to cover his cash costs by $5 per animal . Even though it might be possible to postpone his non-cash costs , his cash costs would have to be met . These cash costs would have to be met either by drawing on reserves or by borrowing . If 100 feeders were being considered , the loss of cash costs would amount to $500 . If the animal were raised , $45 above cash costs would remain . Since  | only cash costs need be met in a particular year , the amount allowed for non-cash items such as depreciation on equipment could be used for family living without affecting the scale of operation . In the case of the purchased feeder , the farmer would need to go into debt in order to cover his cash costs . The above should not be interpreted as a defense of vertical diversification . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure can affect the riskiness of a livestock operation . While non-cash costs may have been prepaid , they eventually have to be met if the business is to be maintained . But an enterprise that permits the operator to choose when they can be met necessarily has greater flexibility . The operator who is in a position to survive one or two lean years probably should choose the enterprise that will offer the greatest long run profit . The farmer who can not survive poor years should consider livestock enterprises that minimize loss prospects while holding the prospect of a more certain , though less substantial profit . Considerable variation exists among enterprises in this respect . When fixed costs are a large proportion of total costs it is possible to remain in business for a longer period than when most of the costs are of a cash or variable nature . Assuming high fixed costs , it is possible for a farmer to lose money for a long period of time but not be aware of the fact that he is failing to meet all of the costs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of the costs are of a variable nature . In this respect a dairy farmer may suffer " slow strangulation " while a broiler producer is forced to " face the firing squad . " Many other enterprises provide contrasts in cost structure . The difference in cost structure may partially explain the popularity of the " deferred feeding system " wherein calves are purchased in the fall and are kept for a full year before being sold . With such a system many costs are of a non-cash nature . This is in contrast to the feeder operation described earlier in which larger animals are purchased and the costs are largely cash or variable in nature .  | Size of enterprise In the earlier section on size of farm , it was found that unit costs varied considerably as size of farm was increased . The same set of principles affect livestock enterprises . A twenty-cow dairy herd may be an uneconomical operation for a farm . Yet , if the number of cows were doubled to forty , dairy might represent the best use of resources on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of size of herd or flock to cost of production . Some examples will be presented ; yet , it should be realized they are for illustrative purposes only . The economic size of livestock unit changes rapidly and is not the same in all parts of the country . It is important to make similar estimates for the individual farm and for types of farming areas . John Hopkin of the Bank of America has investigated economies of size in cattle feeding in California . ) He reports that cattle feeding in California is a decreasing cost industry . That is , on the basis of the feedlot operators in California , costs tended to decrease as the size of the cattle feeding operation increased . Table 15-3 is presented to illustrate Hopkin 's findings . Since feed costs are similar by size of operation , non-feed costs are the important costs in connection with size . A detailed analysis of non-feed costs indicates that labor , depreciation , repairs , and interest on investment declined on a per unit basis as size of feedlot increased . This means that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California conditions . Economic size of herd or flock depends upon technological and economic conditions . Not many years ago a ten-cow dairy herd was sufficiently large for an efficient operation . At the present time , herds considerably larger than this are considered neceswary . One hundred-cow dairies are not uncommon and in a few years the bulk of our milk may come from dairies that have 100 cows or more . This ' John A. Hopkin , " Economies of Size in the Cattle Feeding Industry of California , " Journal of Farm Economics , Vol . XL , May 1958 , pp. 417-429.  | indicates that economies of size in livestock production will have a direct bearing on the number of farmers remaining in agriculture . figure There continues to be a place for the livestock enterprise which is supplementary or complementary to other farm enterprises . Such enterprises use resources that would otherwise go to waste . For example , a winter feeding cattle operation may use labor that would not be otherwise employed . A sheep enterprise may utilize crop aftermath or roughages that would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which will permit the more economical production of some crop . This has led many farm management experts to give the advice that farmers should either have quite small livestock enterprises ( supplementary or complementary ) or rather large enterprises ( sufficiently large to realize cost  | efficiencies ) . Rather than follow a general rule , however , it is better to evaluate carefully each farm 's resources and determine by this method the size and type of livestock enterprise best adapted to the farm . This can be done by use of the budget in estimating the effect different sizes of a given livestock enterprise will have on income . Operating decisions Once the type and size of livestock enterprise has been determined for a farm , there are a host of operating decisions that must be made within a production period . A classification of these decisions is given , followed by a treatment of the relevant factors which must be considered . Feeding . Feed costs represent a substantial portion of the production costs for all livestock enterprises . The principles of nutrition interact with economic forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ composition of the ration . Nutrition workers have discovered various materials which must be present in livestock feeds for growth , reproduction , maintenance , and the production of livestock products . Different feeds contain varying quantities of these materials with all essential materials not being present in all feeds . Therefore , the problem exists of supplying the needs of the animals from a variety of feeds that contain varying proportions of the essential materials , or which may contain some of certain but none of other materials . Feeds are frequently classified on the basis of the percentage of total digestible nutrients the feed contains . Total digestible nutrients ( TDN ) refer to that portion of a feed which can be taken and digested by the animal body . Protein , carbohydrates , and fat constitute the generally recognized nutrient classes as used in feed analysis . Either a concentrate or a roughage may be high or low in a particular food class . Feeds , of course , can be classified into nutrient groups . There are those feeds that may be classified largely as protein feeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Others may be  | classified as carbohydrates such as the various grain concentrates , although the grains contain varying proportions of carbohydrates and protein . To the extent that one feed can be substituted for another at a constant rate within a classification , the classification has economic meaning . That is , if 1.18 pounds of soybean meal will substitute for one pound of linseed meal , regardless of the proportion of the two that are used , then they substitute at a constant rate . Two feeds in different classifications , such as corn and soybean meal , will not usually substitute at a constant rate but rather at a diminishing rate . The economics of nutrition depend largely upon these relationships between feeds which were referred to earlier in the section on economic principles . Table 15-4 is presented to further illustrate these principles . Columns 1 and 2 give the combinations of alfalfa hay and grain concentrate that will produce on the average a 300-pound gain on steer calves . Column 5 gives the total digestible nutrients . The substitution ratio is given in column 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtain the most economic combination , it is necessary to know the price of the two feeds . Assume alfalfa is thirty dollars per ton and grain is three cents per pound , then : figure Under these circumstances , approximately 1,100 pounds of alfalfa hay should be fed to 1,259 pounds of concentrate .  | Concentrate-alfalfa hay combinations to produce 300-pound gain on steer calves and related data figure  | There are two major considerations not included in material such as this . First , no consideration is given to the quality of the product produced . If the animals are to be slaughtered , this is important . Second , no consideration is given to time . If a high alfalfa ration relative to concentrates is fed , it will take longer to put on a 300-pound gain than if the reverse were followed . Information such as that presented above must be interpreted in this light . However , procedures are being developed to take these factors into consideration . ' Feeding recommendations currently are taking economic considerations into account much more than was formerly the case . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest to warrant additional comment . The percentage of the concentrate varies from about 83 to 32 per cent . Pounds of TDN per 100 pounds of gain vary from a high of 568 to a low of 495 . This indicates that different classes of feed can be substituted . It also indicates that the TDN in a ration is not a satisfactory measure of its economic efficiency . A big challenge in animal feeding research is to identify the extent to which the principal feeds will substitute for each other . Once this has been determined , relative prices may be used in determining the most economical ration . Obviously considerable analysis is required because the composition of feeds is affected by the environmental conditions under which they are produced . Farmers do not always need to worry about such details . The various state experiment stations are continuously conducting experiments from which such determinations can be made . Farmers also are buying considerable quantities of their feeds pre-mixed . In such cases , the feed companies must evaluate different combinations of feedstuffs and take into consideration relative prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must decide whether they can more economically mix their own feed or buy pre-mixed feeds . Again , reference to the results obtained by an independent research footnote 2 W. G. Brown and George H. Arscott , " A Method of Dealing with Time in Determination of Optimum Factor Inputs , " Journal of Farm Economics , Vol . XL , no. 3 , August 1958.  | agency such as an experiment station appears to be the best procedure . It should not be concluded that farmers do or should change their ration on a daily or weekly basis in response to price changes . However , relative feed prices do change significantly from one season to the next , and the relative proportions of different feeds in the ration become an important farm management decision . The alert manager should be aware of the feed substitution possibilities for the livestock enterprise in his farm organization . Labor efficiency . Labor costs constitute a significant part of total costs in livestock production . This is not surprising in view of the fact that mechanization for livestock has not been developed nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are two possible ways of using labor more efficiently . One is to combine it with the proper amount of capital in the form of milking machines , automatic feeders , hay-making equipment , etc . Another is to make the labor more productive with the same amount of capital by studying the livestock chores to be performed with the objective of simplifying them as much as possible . The determination of the proper amount of capital to combine with labor is frequently a complex problem . If it is a question of whether or not capital should be substituted for labor when output is unchanged , the problem is relatively simple . A rather straightforward partial budget can be constructed to handle the problem . However , when capital in the form of labor-saving machinery is added , the size of the livestock enterprise can frequently be increased . Or if the livestock enterprise is not enlarged , labor may be available to expand some other part of the farming operation . This leads to a consideration of the entire farm operation and rather complete farm budgets may need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data presented in Table 15-5 deserve comment . The increases in efficiency of labor in agricultural production is the combined result of a number of forces . Probably the greatest influence p 300 is the great technological improvements that have been made in agriculture . Mechanization and increased yields of both crops and livestock have combined to improve labor efficiency . Mechanization has resulted in greater amounts of capital being associated with labor . Other improvements such as the development of both animal and figure crop hybrids have not required significant quantities of new capital . The labor force also is better trained than ever before . Improvements in work routine and simplification of farm buildings have also increased the efficiency with which labor is used . Later in the text a chapter is devoted to the economic use of labor and to a review of some of the principles of work simplification . As mentioned earlier ,  | work simplification offers considerable possibilities in livestock production because of the multitude of labor tasks involved . Improvements in labor efficiency have not been the same for both crops and livestock , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was 91 per cent more efficient in 1959 than in the 1947 ? 49 base period used in constructing the indexes . Labor efficiency in crop production increased 103 per cent during the same period , but for livestock production the increase was 51 per cent . From 1910 to 1959 , the index increased from 70 to 151 ; the increase was from 45 to 203 for crop production . The table also shows that improvements in the use of labor have not been the same for all livestock enterprises . From 1910 to 1959 , the increase for meat animals was from 84 to 113 . In dairy production , the improvement has been considerably more than this . The most dramatic increase , however , has been in poultry production . This has been the result of substantial improvements in feeding , nutrition , disease control , breeding , and sanitation , as well as better buildings and more efficient methods of feeding and other care that formerly required considerable labor . Markets and the timing of production Livestock and livestock product prices have long been noted for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been at their yearly high in July and August which is followed by seasonal lows in the fall and early winter . Milk prices are high during the winter months . Fat cattle prices are usually favorable in early winter . We know from elementary economics that if the demand remains constant the only thing that can cause a change in price is a change in supply . Anyone familiar with the production of livestock and livestock products realizes that the quantity going on the market is not constant throughout the year . Dairy cows tend to freshen in the spring . Because of this and lush spring pastures , maximum milk production usually occurs in May and June . This results in lower summer prices and higher winter prices . It is more difficult to  | farrow bogs during the winter and early spring months . As a result fewer hogs go to market in July and August and prices are more favorable . Therefore , the seasonal price lows and highs are usually the result of the conditions of production . However , seasonal demands for certain items such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices . Historically , there usually has been good reason for the seasonal production patterns that have resulted in the seasonal price fluctuations . Let us refer to swine again as an example . If hogs are to be put on the market in August , they must be farrowed in February . Not only must they be fattened during the hot summer months , they will be farrowed in one of the coldest months of the year . Unless death losses are to be high , there must be adequate farrowing equipment and close attention must be given to the sow . All of this means that production costs will be higher than if the pigs were farrowed later in spring and fattened in the cool of the fall . This leads us to one of the more complex problems of livestock management . When should livestock and livestock products be marketed ? In the first place , seasonal highs can not always be predicted . Although the seasonal high for hogs has historically been in the summer months , this may not hold for a particular year . Too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lows are gradually being leveled out . But , assuming such seasonal differentials do exist and that they can be predicted , the cost of producing at various times of the year must be considered . This may not be a simple determination to make . If adequate records are available on the present production pattern , the problem is simplified considerably . It should be possible to estimate the changes in costs that will be associated with a change in the production pattern . Not all costs will change , of course , so that many parts of the farm business need not be taken into consideration . The example below will illustrate some of the relevant variables . The problem deals with the marketing of beef cattle . Assume that the usual production pattern on a farm is to buy 700-pound year-  | lings late in November . An effort is made to get them on feed by December 1 so that they can be marketed by April 1 weighing around 950 pounds . This requires a gain of 2.1 pounds per day . I lowever , the seasonal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best prices occurring around March 1.3 An alternative might be to buy late in October and sell in March in an attempt to hit the seasonal high . One advantage of this would be that feeders normally will cost a bit less in October . However , labor costs will be higher because October and early November are busy months and additional labor may be needed to help with other farm work . The data below are for a lot of 100 steers. figure  | While the superiority of the proposed plan is considerable in this particular example , there may be other benefits and disadvantages that can not be reduced to dollars and cents that will be deciding factors . For example , having March free from cattle feeding may be worth something to the operator . He may be able to use this time to advantage in getting ready for spring work , or he may wish to take his vacation in March . On the other side of the ledger , he may feel the effort of buying in October and putting the cattle on feed when other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may believe that he will not be able to exercise careful managerial control over both the cattle enterprise and the other operations . The proposed plan may be more risky in that a poor buy when the farmer is under the pressure of time in October could jeopardize his profits . Too if the cattle got " off their feed " during this period , their rate of gain would suffer . Another risk might be in the fall harvest operation . If he did not have dependable hired labor he could fail to realize full value from the crops being harvested in October and early November . Yet the arithmetic and logic used in setting down the money aspects of the situation permit a more intelligent consideration of the less tangible aspects of the problem . Marketing agencies have long been aware of the seasonality aspects of agricultural production . They like to have an even flow of agricultural products into the marketing channels throughout the year . This permits them to use their labor and equipment more efficiently , which is an important motive behind contract farming and vertical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operation . Many hog producers are moving away from twice-a-year farrowing and are marketing hogs throughout the year . Various pricing and quota devices have been used to even the flow of milk products during the year . Some packers have their own feedlots which permit them to integrate their feeding operations with farmer marketing . It may be that the seasonal production of livestock and livestock products is changing . However , as long as  | costs of production and prices received are not constant throughout the year , the farm management decision of " when to produce " will remain . Cyclical price changes One of the striking characteristics of livestock production in the United States is the existence of cycles in total production . These production cycles are closely associated with cyclical price movements . These price and production movements have a direct bearing on farm management decisions and will be discussed from that point of view . figure  | cattle numbers declined in 1949 , and then increased every year until 1956 . Cattle numbers then declined sharply until 1959 , when they started increasing again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they also increased from 1949 but that they reached a peak in 1951 . Slaughter cattle prices then declined every year until 1956 . The important point here is that cattle prices increased during the early part of the period in which numbers were being built up . Eventually the increased production depressed prices ; however a time lag occurred before cattle numbers were reduced in response to the lower prices . Cycles in hog production occur more frequently than for cattle . This is because swine production can be expanded or contracted in a shorter period of time than can the production of cattle . Pig crops reached peaks in 1951 , in 1955 , and again in 1959 . Sheep and lamb numbers , on the other hand , are more stable . In recent years they have been increasing slightly . There is considerable evidence that many livestock producers make decisions as to whether they will increase or decrease production on the basis of the current year 's prices . This means that when cattle prices start up , heifers are kept for breeding and cows that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued production of calves . The result is that the higher cattle prices bring forth increased production but only after a few years have elapsed . In the case of hogs the feed-hog price ratio is quite important in farmer decisions . Highs and lows occur more frequently than is the case with cattle . It has been estimated these hog cycles are of approximately four years duration . Because these cycles can be observed over time , the information can be put to use in the making of farm management decisions . It is not recommended that farmers try to " outguess " these cycles and try to produce for the market only during extreme highs . Even price forecasters who spend their entire time studying market forces and trends are unable to predict the high and low points with accuracy . However , if a farmer has a livestock enterprise , he may wish to  | curtail his operation somewhat if he learns , for instance , that cattle numbers for the country as a whole are at an extremely high level . Conversely , if he believes prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have an influence on the way he handles his breeding stock . Such decisions should be based on careful study of market forces and the cost structure of the farm . Current prices are a poor basis for decisions of this kind . Information on future price movements fall into the same category as information on crop yields , technological processes , technological change , and all other planning data . All such data are subject to error . Errors in cyclical price projections are probably no greater than the error in some of the variables mentioned above . As a result , prices should be treated in the same manner as other uncertain elements . A valuable use of such information is in timing the addition or elimination of a livestock enterprise . A farmer may decide that he should have a livestock enterprise on his farm , but may logically delay its addition if the price of breeding stock is unusually high . Conversely , he may add an enterprise sooner than he had planned if it appears that his initial investment can he significantly reduced by purchasing livestock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same token a farmer may decide on the basis of long run profits that a livestock enterprise should be eliminated . However , if price prospects are bright for that commodity , he may profitably decide to postpone the elimination of a particular livestock enterprise . Also the prospect of a series o5 bleak years may hasten the decision to discontinue an enterprise . The above paragraph applies to livestock enterprises where breeding stock is involved . The feeder is even more justified in adjusting his operation from one year to the next on the basis of current conditions . It makes little sense to feed exactly the same number and kind of livestock every year when different prices prevail for the feeder livestock as well as for market livestock , to say nothing of the price and availability of feed . However , the person who  | varies his feeding program should base it on something more than current prices or what other feeders seem to be doing . Outlook information is available from various state extension services , as well as from the United States Department of Agriculture . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highly reliable for prediction purposes , yet people who specialize in the study of such problems do predict direction correctly far more often than does the layman .

It follows that efficient management and use of labor is necessary for the successful management of today 's farms . Objectives of labor management The objectives of successful farm management are not just to maximize returns to labor alone , but rather to use all of the factors of production to best achieve the farmer 's objectives . Since labor must be combined with the other factors of production , it is not possible to discuss labor in isolation . Labor management is closely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an especially close relationship with machinery management . Therefore this chapter should be considered in combination with the one following on machinery management . The proper labor management policy obviously will depend upon the particular , farming situation . Some of the common situations will be described and then discussed in detail . One situation of a short run nature that exists on many farms occurs when the labor is , for all practical purposes , a fixed quantity . This occurs when the labor supply is limited to the operator and his family or if year-round hired help is employed . Capital , in the form of machinery , may be fixed if the machinery has already been ac-  | quired . In this case the purpose of using labor more efficiently would be to : ( 1 ) Increase output and hence profits by the use of the fixed quantity of labor . ( 2 ) Leave output relatively constant but reduce the amount of labor expended . This would result in : ( a ) More leisure for the operator or his family . ( b ) Create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off-farm work . ( c ) Increase the amount of leisure time for hired workers , thereby improving morale . In a longer run setting , it may be possible to vary the machinery supply , the labor supply remaining relatively fixed . Again this would normally be the case when the labor supply is limited to that of the operator and his family or when year-round hired labor is employed . In this case there are more opportunities for influencing the productivity of labor because the amount of capital which can be combined with labor can be varied . Here , increased efficiency in the use of labor may result in : ( 1 ) Increased output and greater profits . ( 2 ) Improved morale on the part of the hired workers by making their work more pleasant or by increasing the amount of leisure time . ( 3 ) Increasing the amount of leisure time or making work more pleasant for operator and his family . ( 4 ) Making possible off-farm work . In many situations the total labor supply is not fixed , although a portion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day , week , or month . Furthermore , the amount of capital that can be combined with labor may be varied . With this situation a range of possibilities exist by which labor productivity or efficiency can be improved . Here the possible objectives of labor management would be to : ( 1 ) Obtain the most efficient combination of labor and capital . This may involve substituting capital for labor and thereby reducing costs which will result in increased profits .  | ( 2 ) Increase output by increasing the inputs of either capital or labor or both when such increase in output will result in greater profit . ( 3 ) Release the operator or family for increased leisure or offfarm work . The above should make clear that the objective of labor management will vary with the individual farm organization . Each of the above situations will be analyzed in detail later in the chapter . Before proceeding to this , a brief description is given of the role of labor in contemporary farm management . The labor input on commercial farms Tables 16-1 and 16-2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the labor resource on various commercially operated farms . The hired labor varies from 6 to 19 per cent of total cash expenditures . Table 16-2 shows that hired labor , as a percentage of the total labor force , varied from 12 to 60 per cent in 1957 on the commercially operated family farms . The wheat-sorghum farm represents a rather highly mechanized type of farming , having a ma-figure  | chinery investment of about $8,000 to farm approximately 700 acres , one-half of which is in summer-fallow each year . Even with a farm of this type about 5.8 per cent of the cash expenditures were for hired labor in 1957 . Of the total labor used on this farm , 7.4 per cent is hired . Further study of Table 16-2 will indicate that the proportion of hired and operator 's labor has not changed greatly since 1937-41 . Although the data presented are only for selected locations , the total labor input on most of the farms has declined since 1937-41 . During this same period output increased , which has resulted from improvements in technology and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The increased output per farm has not resulted from increasing the labor force , either for agriculture as a whole or on a per farm basis . This sets the stage for an important consideration in the management of labor . figure There was a time in American agriculture when the farmer had very little capital to combine with his labor ; he needed to select a  | farm organization that would utilize his labor many hours of the day and for as many days as possible . Even though the marginal return to his labor was low for many enterprises , he needed to utilize his labor as fully as possible because this was the chief input he had to market . Conditions have changed , however . The capital that is combined with labor should receive considerable attention . It may be possible to utilize all the land and capital that is available without exhausting the available labor . A farmer may do this because it is profitable , or he may do it because it provides him with some leisure time . The objective of labor management , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor during the entire year . Labor productivity ? quantity of labor and capital fixed When the quantity of labor and capital is fixed , the essence of labor management comes down to a study of the best way to increase the productivity of the given labor input . In general there are two main ways this can be accomplished . One is by a study of the tasks to be . performed with the objective of finding the most efficient method of accomplishing a given task . This is frequently called " work simplification . " For example , by changing the grip or leverage on a hammer , fewer strokes may be required to drive a nail . Another example is the development of " rhythm " by a cotton picker . A cotton picker who does not have a definite procedure can usually increase his output-by analyzing his motions . The other way of increasing labor productivity pertains to the over-all management of labor . Examples are the scheduling of work and the payment of incentives to hired labor . First , " work simplification " will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defining work simplification is " getting more output from essentially the same inputs . " It involves a systematic and careful analysis of the task to be performed , a listing of the essential parts of the task , an appraisal of the resources  | available to accomplish the job , and the development of the most logical method of accomplishing the work . In their book Farm Work Simplification , ) Vaughan and Hardin say Farm work simplification may be summarized as a systematic study of work methods in order to : Eliminate all unnecessary work . Simplify the hand and body motions in doing the work . Provide a more convenient arrangement of work areas and location of materials for doing the work . Improve on the adequacy , suitability , and use of equipment for doing the work . Organize the work routine for full and effective use of men and machines . Anyone who has observed operations on a number of farms realizes there is great variability in the efficiency with which farm tasks are performed . The performance of livestock chores is one source of much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corrals , gates , and equipment all combine to create wide differences in work efficiency . In regard to livestock chores the first step is to prepare a map of the farmstead . Lines are then drawn from one point to another as trips are made during the performance of chores . Any obvious retracing of steps can be quickly identified . The choring operation can be studied to see if all the trips are necessary . Light carts or wagons may be used to combine some of the carrying operations . The analysis can then be broadened to study the improvements . Are gates of the type that can be easily opened and closed ? Can springs and latches be used to advantage on doors or gates that must be entered when the hands are otherwise occupied ? Are the buildings properly arranged in relation to the jobs that need to be performed ? Fairly simple rearrangement and improvement may greatly improve labor efficiency . footnote I Lawrence W. Vaughan and Lowell S. Hardin , Farm Work Simplification , New York , John Wiley &; Sons , 1949 , p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to increase the efficiency of the labor force . It is suggested that this he considered only after the other avenues have been explored . Often rather simple rearrangements can yield handsome dividends and these should be investigated before major changes are made . A careful analysis of operations is needed before major alternatives can be isolated . Management of hired labor . The management of labor still remains largely in the category of an art rather than a science . Some people have the ability to supervise employees , keep them happy , and yet accomplish a tremendous amount of work . Others do not seem to be capable of inspiring and leading others . There are , however , some operating rules which can be followed with profit . One important aspect of labor management relates to the scheduling of work . Fences , buildings , and machinery can be repaired ( luring periods when field operations are slack . Furthermore , the labor force should be informed at all times as to what is to be done and what is expected of them . A schedule of work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or months and posted so that laborers can see it . If one task is completed the laborer can go to the next without verbal instruction from the supervisor . When a task is completed it can be checked off . Such schedules should be prepared at a time when the manager can give them careful consideration so that the work can be well planned . Interest in the welfare and objectives of farm workers is desirable . If this interest is genuine it will improve morale and may add to the interest the worker shows in the farm business . This interest can be rewarded by the payment of incentives . These incentives should be adapted to the enterprises on the farm . For example , if a worker has the responsibility of helping sows farrow , giving him a share of all pigs saved above a specified number per litter may give him encouragement to leave his bed on a cold winter night . The knowledge of farm workers may also be used to advantage by the management of labor . The encouragement of suggestions is  | one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to participate in the farm planning , particularly as it pertains to their work . If a suggestion clearly adds to the income of the farm a bonus may be appropriate . Many industrial concerns have annual contests in which they give a bonus to the employees who have made the best suggestions during the year . There is a wide range of farm labor conditions in the United States . In some areas hired labor receives wages and perquisites which make their income equivalent to what they would earn in off-farm work . Such wages may be justified if they are expected to operate expensive equipment and work rather long hours . In other cases , the farm laborer does mostly hand work . He may be paid on a piece basis ; the work may be seasonal in nature . Housing conditions are often poor and the level of living is low . Often such workers move from area to area following the harvest . They may not become real members of a community . Because they own little property , they may pay taxes only indirectly . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a community . It is outside the scope of this chapter to discuss this social problem in its entirety . There are , however , some facts which should be recognized : 1 . Hired labor is necessary to the successful operation of most commercially operated farms . 2 . In many cases this hired labor must have considerable ability because they are expected to operate expensive equipment or feed and care for valuable livestock . 3 . Farmers must expect to pay , in the long run , wages comparable to those received in industry if they are to get an equally competent labor supply . Consideration must be given to perquisites in addition to money wages paid . 4 . When farmers depend on workers who are paid subsistence wages and have living conditions considerably below that of the remainder of the population , a social problem is created . Given the political climate in which we live , this is a problem which can not be ignored . Farmers have a particular responsibility to help in solving this problem .  | 5 . High farm wage rates may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large farm must depend on hired labor , high wage rates will fall more heavily on the farm with the higher proportion of hired relative to operator or family labor . On the other hand , higher wage rates will stimulate mechanization which tends to increase size of farm . Labor productivity ? labor fixed , capital variable When the amount of capital which can be combined with labor is variable , more opportunities for improving labor productivity develop than when capital is fixed or held constant . The first and most obvious possibility is to increase output by acquiring more or different machinery or other capital items . The techniques for testing the profitability of such a decision are outlined elsewhere in the book . In particular the next chapter goes into the question in considerable detail . Therefore some of the less obvious possible benefits of combining more capital with labor are discussed here . It may be that morale of the operator , his family , or his labor force will be a major indirect benefit . It is important for people to like what they are doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disagreeable tasks by outmoded methods may create a feeling of frustation or dissatisfaction . If work can be made pleasant and to a person 's liking , not only is his productivity likely to improve , but he may also be willing to work for what would otherwise be a less satisfactory wage . Obviously , it is possible to overinvest in capital equipment for morale factors alone . In fact , in the next chapter an instance where overinvestment occurred will be described . Yet it is a potential benefit of investment and should not be overlooked . Another possible benefit relates to off-farm work . The number of farmers doing off-farm work is increasing each year . An off-farm job may be looked upon as another enterprise from the standpoint of over-all farm management . If opportunity exists for off-farm work the farmer may consider mechanizing further so that he can be  | freed from some of the farm work . This type of decision can be analyzed appropriately by use of the partial budget . The formula to be used would be : increased income + reduced expenses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the above formula will be the wages from off-farm work . Expenses are not likely to be reduced unless an enterprise is dropped or the addition of a piece of new capital equipment reduces hired labor costs . On the other side of the formula , income may be reduced if the farming operation is curtailed because of the off-farm work . Expenses may well be increased . An example of this would be hiring of some labor to do the work the operator is now doing . Still another possible benefit of improving labor productivity is to increase the amount of leisure time available to the farmer and his family . The benefits of relaxation and recreation have been amply demonstrated in all lines of endeavor . There is good reason why farmers should attempt to take advantage of these benefits . An important part of farm planning is to provide for definite periods for recreation . During some seasons of the year this may not be possible . If this is the case , some leisure time should be planned for in other seasons . Labor productivity ? labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ varied , it may be desirable to substitute one for the other or to increase both in order to expand production . In other words , the problem may be either one of proportionality or of scale . Historically the trend has been toward increasing the amount of capital combined with labor . The result has been increased output per unit of labor used . The proper amount of capital to combine with labor is based  | upon the substitution principle which involves the relative prices of labor and machines or other forms of capital . Overtime wage rates have increased more than the cost of capital goods . So long as we enjoy economic progress this will continue to be the case . Although the trend is in this direction , the question of timing is important . It is possible either to be too quick or too slow in making substitution . The principle of substitution as discussed in chapter 3 applies to this problem . Changes in output must be considered as well as changes in the proportion of labor and capital . For example , a corn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corn , but if corn acreage can be increased to 100 acres , the purchase of a corn picker may be a wise use of capital . figure Table 16-3 illustrates how capital , in the form of weed spray , can be substituted for hoeing labor in the production of strawberries . The 1948 data are taken from a production cost study made during that year . By 1957 the prevailing method of weed control had shifted from hand hoeing toward the use of chemicals in the  | Estimated harvesting costs for tart cherries on various acreages with three different yield levels figure  | control of weeds , although hand cultivation had not been entirely replaced . The first column gives the dollar cost at 1948 prices and the hours of hand hoeing . The second column gives the cost of hand cultivation with the 1957 prices . This is the figure that should be compared with the $55 for the chemical and hand method of weed control . Because output is constant , ninety dollars labor cost is replaced by the twenty-five dollars weed control expenditure . In physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollar spraying costs . If the labor is a variable cost , the substitution should be made because hoeing labor cost $1.20 per hour in 1957 . If labor is a fixed cost a somewhat different situation prevails . The amount of labor saved is seventy-five hours . In this situation it cost twentyfive dollars to save seventy-five hours of labor . If the opportunity cost of the labor is greater than approximately thirty-three cents per hour , the substitution should be made and the labor used elsewhere on the farm . It is not likely that the opportunity cost of the fixed labor supply or the value of leisure would be less than thirty-three cents per hour ; if it should be , the substitution of capital for labor should not be made . Obviously , as the price of labor is increased , the incentive for the substitution of capital for labor becomes correspondingly greater . Another example of the substitution of capital for labor is provided by Tables 16-4 and 16-5 . Mechanical harvesting methods for tart cherries involve tree shakers and catching devices which are capable of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for transportation from the orchard . The data presented were obtained in Michigan . When cherries are hand harvested , 80 per cent of the total labor used is for picking . Under these circumstances , mechanical harvesting is obviously of interest . A comparison of costs for the two methods is given in Table 16-4 . This comparison reveals that capital is being substituted for labor . For every acreage and yield situation tested , labor expense is least for mechanical harvesting . Other costs are greater , however ,  | for mechanical harvesting ; because of this , mechanical harvesting is not always the best alternative . // Comparison of financial results from mechanical harvesting and hand harvesting on various acreages with three different yield levels figure The yield and quality of tart cherries that are harvested mechanically may be equal to that of hand picked fruit . However , if equipment is not properly adjusted or if conditions are not ideal , both the yield and quality may be lower for mechanized than for hand  | harvesting . In Table 16-5 the assumption is made that yields are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent because of possible technical difficulties in the mechanical operations . The reduced receipts are added to the cost of the mechanical harvesting and compared with the costs of hand harvesting to determine the effect of mechanical harvesting on income . The technique here is similar to the partial budgeting formula explained in chapter 7 . On the smaller acreages hand harvesting is superior unless higher yields are obtained . This is illustrated by a comparison of the twenty-two- and twenty-eight-acreage situations . A decrease in net income is budgeted in going from twenty-two to twenty-eight acres with a two-ton yield if mechanical harvesting is used . This is a result of the necessity of purchasing two mechanical harvesting units for the twenty-eight-acre operation . Labor records Hired labor may represent a significant cash expenditure on many farms ( Table 16-1 ) . An input of this importance deserves some special attention , as a small improvement in labor efficiency may substantially reduce costs . An employer may be able to make better wages managing his labor than by trying to substitute his own labor for that of a hired worker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is essential to any systematic analysis of labor efficiency . In addition to serving as an aid in improving labor efficiency , some records are necessary in the preparation and filing of income tax and social security returns . One method of providing records for systematic analysis ' is the use of weekly time cards . An example of such a card is given in Table 16-6 . Either the employer or the employee can keep such cards . The data from these cards can be posted to the labor section of the expense record described in chapter 5 . These cards can be filed during busy seasons and posted to enterprise or other farm records at other times of the year . In this particular form the time  | is recorded by enterprises . On a more specialized farm it might be desirable to record the time by jobs such as seedbed preparation , cultivation , or harvesting . Which form is used will depend on the use to which the data will be put . Such data are invaluable to the budgeting which is often necessary in analyzing farm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is possible to develop a calendar of operations for various combinations of enterprises . If expansion in one enterprise and contraction in another is being considered , it is possible to predict the effect this will have on labor and machine use . The purpose of such planning is to determine if labor " bottlenecks " are likely to develop . figure  | The calendar of operations Reference has been made at various places in the book to a calendar of operations for the purpose of making more efficient use of both labor and capital items . Illustrations of such a calendar are given in Figures 16-1 , 16-2 , and 16-3 2 . These data are for irrigated crop farms in Jefferson County , Oregon . figure
