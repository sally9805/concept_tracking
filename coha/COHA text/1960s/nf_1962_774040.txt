txt // units . A factor in favor of the ENE system is that it is much more accurate when one is comparing the feeding value of concentrates and forages and attempting to arrive at the most economical ration . The difficulty with the TDN and related systems is that they tend to overevaluate forages in comparison to concentrates . This is so because there are more losses in combustible gases and in the work of assimilation for forages than for concentrates . In the United States , feeding standards , which contain tables of nutrient requirements or allowances for dairy cattle and other animals , frequently list energy allowances in more than one form . Table 3.1 contains information on energy requirements in TDN and DE for dairy cows of different weights . Similar information for calves and heifers is presented in Chapter 6 . Because of variation in energy content between feeds from different areas and between different lots , 10 to 15 per cent more energy should be allowed under most farm conditions than is called for in Table 3.1 . Energy allowances for maintenance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mature animals are presented in Table 3.1 . People closely associated with the feeding of dairy cattle find it helpful to keep in mind a few representative values as aids in evaluating dairy cattle rations . It may be noted from Table 3.1 that 7 pounds of TDN are required daily for maintenance for a cow weighing 1,000 pounds . This is increased to 8 pounds of TDN for cows weighing 1,200 pounds . Cows weighing 1,500 pounds need about 9.5 pounds of TDN . Cows in poor flesh need some feed in addition to the usual allowance for maintenance . Cows in the first or second lactation should be fed enough for adequate growth . The requirements for growth given in Table 6.1 may be used for these animals , or about 4 pounds of TDN per day may be added to the figures in Table 3.1 . Grazing cows may require up to 40 per cent additional energy for maintenance on account of their extra activity . Energy allowances for lactation . A major portion of the energy needs of high-producing cows is for milk production . Energy requirements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Table 3.1 . Milk of high fat content requires appreciably more energy . About 15 per cent more energy must be supplied for the production of a pound of milk containing 4.5 per cent fat than is needed for a pound of 3.5 per cent milk . A good value to remember when calculating rations is 0.32 pounds of TDN for each pound of milk containing 4.0 per cent fat . Adequate supplies of energy are particularly important during the very early part of lactation . Frequently , high-producing cows are unable to consume enough energy to support their capacity for production . During this period , energy intake should he increased as rapidly as possible while still maintaining good feed acceptance by the cows . Additional allowance for pregnancy . The total energy rvgMrcment // for pregnancy is not large , but allowance must be made for this important work of the cow . The usual recommendations are to supply the amounts of energy indicated in Table 3.1 during the last two or three months of pregnancy . Cows in good flesh may need somewhat less than the amounts listed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Protein Protein , or substances from which protein can be synthesized by bacteria in the rumen , is essential for the formation of tissue in growth , for the maintenance of these tissues , and as a source of the proteins in milk . There is no protein requirement for exercise or work . Excess protein is easily metabolized by the body for energy purposes and may be utilized directly or stored as fat . For this reason it may be economically sound to overfeed protein in instances where it is cheaper than other energy sources . Dairy cows can make use of protein equivalent from urea or other nitrogen sources for up to one-third of their protein in a ration well balanced in regard to other nutrients . Measurement of protein . The protein content of feeds is determined by chemical analysis which measures the nitrogen present . Since nitrogen occurs in a constant percentage of specific proteins , it is possible to calculate the amount of protein in a feed from this value . It is generally assumed that the protein of common feedstuffs contains 16.0 per cent nitrogen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a feed by 6.25 gives the per cent of protein . Protein values obtained by the above method are referred to as " crude protein , " since nitrogen from other than true protein may be included . Protein values shown on feed tags and commonly expressed for forages are for crude protein . Feeding recommendations for livestock are usually expressed as " digestible protein . " The method of determination is mentioned in the discussion of TDN . Most tables of feed composition similar to Table 3.2 include digestible protein as well as crude protein . Recommended allowances of protein for growth of calves and heifers . The quality as well as the quantity of protein must be considered for young calves , which are in reality non-ruminants . After the age of four to six weeks , or whenever the calf starts ruminating , the quality of protein becomes less important . Milk supplies the best protein for the baby calf , but research workers have developed some satisfactory substitutes , as is pointed out in the section on calf feeding , where a more complete discussion is presented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contains information on the levels of digestible protein required for maintaining nature animals . Digestible protein needs vary more directly Wit Ii body weight than do energy needs . A cow weighing 1,000 pounds // needs about 0.60 pounds of digestible protein per day . A 1,200-pound cow should have 0.70 pounds and one weighing 1,500 pounds , about 0.85 pounds . Recommended allowances of protein for lactation . The utilization of feed protein for milk is one of the most efficient biological processes known . Approximately 83 per cent of the digestible protein allowed for milk production in a well-balanced ration is secreted in the milk . An average figure to remember is that 0.045 pound of digestible protein is required for each pound of milk containing 4 per cent fat . The requirement is 0.040 pound digestible protein for milk containing 3 per cent fat and 0.050 pound for milk containing 5 per cent fat . Additional allowance of protein for pregnancy . Just as additional energy is required to support pregnancy , some extra protein is necessary . As indicated in Table 3.1 , the equivalent of approximately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months of pregnancy should be supplied . Fat Systems of measuring fats . Fat in concentrates and forages is determined by extraction by ether or other substances which readily dissolve it . In addition to true fat , pigments and other materials are dissolved . In many forages , the pigments , which include carotene , chlorophyll , and xanthophylls , make up the major portion of the extracted material . Because of this , the term ether extract is frequently used in place of the word fat and is more correct . Recommended allowances of fat for calves and heifers . There is a definite requirement for fat in the diet of the young calf . In some experiments , a diet with as little as one to two per cent fat has provided reasonably good results . One need is for a " carrier " for fat-soluble vitamins . Milk fat is ideally suited for the young calf . Other animal fats and hydrogenated vegetable oils may be used successfully as substitutes . Natural vegetable oils are not recommended as the source of fat in cry , lf rations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calves . Average milk contains 28-30 per cent fat on a dry-matter basis . The milk of hightesting breeds may contain more fat than is desirable for greatest success in raising calves . Milk replacers ( feeds designed to replace milk during the early weeks of the life of the calf ) containing 10 to 12 per cent fat on a drymatter basis have been quite successful . One-half of this amount or less has proved satisfactory in experimental rations . Supplying fat in the ration of heifers after the rumen has become functional is not a problem . Normal rations apparently contain adegiiatc amounts . 1 ' // Recommended allowances of fat for maintenance , lactation , and pregnancy . Fats occurring naturally in usual rations appear to he adequate to provide for maintenance and lactation in ruminants . Fat for milk production and body needs can be produced within the animal 's body from the digestion products of carbohydrates . Unless energy can be purchased cheaper in the form of fats than from other sources , there is little economic advantage in feeding concentrates containing fat in addition to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The total mineral content of feeds is determined by burning the feed and weighing the ash . This method , while used almost universally , includes some impurities . Quantities of individual minerals are determined by chemical methods which are specific for them . The mineral needs of cattle are determined similarly to those for other nutrients , that is , by feeding adequate rations except for the mineral under study and determining how much must he added for normal function . Recommended allowances of minerals . Some 15 mineral elements have been shown to be essential in animal nutrition , and these are prolably all needed by dairy cattle . Most of these elements occur in ade quate amounts in usual feeds and are not of serious concern . Common salt , phosphorus , and calcium should always be considered in developing rations for dairy cattle . Suggested daily amounts of cal cium and phosphorus are included in Table 3.1 . The requirement for salt by growing animals is usually adequately supplied by adding one per cent salt to the concentrate mixture and providing , free-choice , a source of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mature lactating animals need about one ounce of salt each day . This may be supplied by the above methods . Cobalt has been found to be deficient in the soil in some areas oI the United States . Forages grown in these areas lack sufficient cobalt for normal ruminant nutrition . In places where cobalt supplementation is needed , 2 ounces of a cobalt salt per ton of feed is sufficient . Iodine must also be added to the diet in large areas of this country . This is particularly true around the Great Lakes and throughout the north western section of the country . This element can be supplied cheaply by feeding iodized salt . A relative deficiency of magnesium occurs in feeds grown in various parts of the country . Animals maintained on these feeds exhibit a tvpieal " tctany " when exposed to stress . Additional magnesium in the diet is not always effective in preventing this condition . Inch more accurate // information on this condition is essential before satisfactory recommendations can be made . Crops grown on very sandy or badly leached soils may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , many of the essential minerals may need to be added to usual feeds . When desired , adequate mineral supplements can be added to the concentrate mixture for a few cents per ton . There is no need to purchase high-priced mineral supplements . Vitamins Vitamins are required by all animals to help carry out the reactions necessary for the body 's metabolism . Only minute quantities are needed in relation to the amounts of other nutrients . Systems for measuring vitamins . Many vitamins can be measured by specific chemical and physical techniques , but biological methods are frequently employed . These involve feeding the material in question to bacteria , or in other cases to specified test animals , and measuring the response in terms of total growth , bone formation , or other changes . Requirements for vitamins are established in a manner similar to that for minerals . Specific vitamins needed . The B-complex vitamins have already been mentioned as being synthesized by bacteria in the mature rumen . Vitamins A and D must be supplied to all ruminants from outside sources . Vitamin C is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When eaten , this vitamin is destroyed in the rumen . Vitamin E is associated with normal muscle metabolism and may play a part in controlling oxidized flavors in milk . Vitamin B12 is important in preventing certain types of anemia . It may be deficient in animals not receiving sufficient amounts of cobalt . This mineral is an essential part of the B12 molecule , and if cobalt is not present , normal amounts of B12 will not be synthesized . Quantitative requirements of cows for carotene are listed in Table 3.1 . A dietary requirement for Vitamin E in cattle rations has not been established . Vitamin A as such is found only in animal tissues or products such as milk . The pigment carotene , occurring in plants , is converted to vitamin A in the animal body . The recommended allowance of carotene for all cattle is approximately 6 milligrams ( mg. ) per 100 pounds live weight per day . Additional carotene should be provided for the last few months of pregnancy in the amount of 30 mg. per day . The amount of carotene in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A found in the milk . Vitamin D. Normally , vitamin 1 ) is supplied in adequae amounts // by sun-cured forages or by exposure of the animal to sunlight . Chemicals in the skin are converted to vitamin D by action of ultraviolet light . Under usual farm conditions , vitamin D supplies are not a problem . It may be profitable to supply 400 International Units of vitamin D per 100 pounds live weight to young calves if they are not exposed to sunlight . This is undoubtedly a generous allowance . Water Water is the cheapest ingredient in dairy cattle rations but of utmost importance . Mature cows consume an average of 12 to 15 gallons of water a day and high-producing ones up to twice this amount . Ready access to water is important . Cows with water constantly available have been shown to produce more milk than those watered twice a day and over 10 per cent more than those watered once a day . A source of clean water is also important for the growth of animals . NUTRIENT CONTRIBUTIONS OF FEEDS The nutrient content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concentrates is given in Table 3.2 . It should be remembered that these are average figures , and indivdual samples of a feed may vary considerably . Knowledge of the nutrient content of feeds is essential if selections of adequate rations to fit the needs of dairy cattle are to be made . Forages , sometimes referred to as rottghages , in general comprise the vegetative part of plants fed to livestock . Common materials are hay , hay-crop silage , corn silage , and pasture crops . These feeds are characterized by being bulky , high in fiber , and low in energy as compared with concentrates . Concentrates are so called because of their relatively higher energy content in relation to forages . The common grains contain from 70 to 80 per cent TDN . Seeds or by-products high in fat contain more energy , with a few going above 100 per cent TDN because of a lot of fat . Byproducts of the processing of grains for human consumption are also considered concentrates , and many are very profitably included in rations for cattle . Protein-rich grains and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are difficult to characterize in either of the above groups include oat hulls and other low-grade products which are derived from grains or other materials during processing . Some of these materials are frequently sold as concentrates but have a feeding value closer to forages. // Energy Content of Feeds The section on nutrient requirements includes a discussion of several systems of expressing requirements and listing the energy content of feeds . The TDN and DE systems are included in Table 3.2 . The numerical values expressed for the energy values of feeds are quite different for these two systems . It must be remembered that TDN is expressed in per cent or pounds per 100 pounds of feed , while DE is expressed in therms per pound of feed . It is well to remember that the energy content of grains is between 70 and 80 pounds of TDN per 100 pounds . Grain by-products which contain the germ or are low in fiber tend to be higher in TDN . When used for forages , the ENE system frequently provides a closer approximation of true feeding values . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rumen fermentation and metabolism which occur with forages . The range of energy values for dry forages is wide , as may be seen in Table 3.2 . Species plays a part here , but the most important factor is date of harvest . Early-cut forage has a much higher feeding value than mature forage from the same field . The energy values for silages and pasture are low because of the large amount of water in these feeds . Hays , silages , and pasture plants of a given variety harvested at the same time will have a similar nutrient value on a dry-matter basis if they are not unduly damaged in harvesting or storage . Footnotes Feeding Dairy Cattle 61 Protein Content of Feeds See Table 3.2 for average values in regard to the protein content of feeds . As mentioned earlier , the protein needs of animals are expressed as digestible protein , while total protein is often the only value available for a given lot of feed . An approximation of the digestible protein in a specific lot of feed may be obtained by comparing it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total protein content in Table 3.2 . Allowance should be made for the type and age of animal for which such approximations are made . For example , protein from vegetable sources is not well utilized by young calves when included in milk replacers . Forages vary a great deal in protein content . Legumes , which include alfalfa , all clovers , lespedeza , soybean , and peanut hays , are relatively high in this nutrient . Grasses usually contain less than half as much protein as legumes . However , if grasses are fertilized with high levels of nitrogen , they may approximate legumes in protein content . The protein content of plants harvested for hay decreases with maturity and becomes very low at the seed stage . The digestibility of the protein in forages also decreases with the maturity of the plant , so that very late-cut hay may have an extremely low content of digestible protein . Concentrates exhibit greater variability in protein content than do forages . Several concentrate feeds , particularly those made from seeds From which the oil has been extracted , are high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meal ) . These are commonly used to bring up t h e protein content of a mixed feed or a total ration to supplement the protein contained in forages . In general , grain by-products are richer in protein than the common small grains . Because of the ability of the rumen to synthesize required amino acids , any single source of natural protein or one containing up to 30 per cent of the total ration from urea or other synthetic protein is adequate for cattle . Fat Content of Feeds The fat content of feeds is not a problem in ruminant feeding , and this nutrient is of minor concern . In forages much of the ether extract is coniposed of pigments such as chlorophyll and carotene rather than true fat . Present methods of processing remove all but a small portion of fat from the oil-seed meals . In some instances , feeds high in fat or waste fats from plant processing may provide economical sources of energy . Animal fats are recommended at only low levels in rations for mature ruminants because of poor acceptability . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeding are calcium , phosphorus , and common salt . Other minerals required by ruminants are usually found in sufficient amounts in typical rations . However , there are specific area deficiencies in parts of the world where plants do not contain sufficient amounts of trace minerals and supplementation is necessary . Salt is inadequate in nearly all feeds and they must be supplemented with it . High-quality forages tend to be the best sources of calcium , while most of the natural phosphorus in ruminant rations is supplied by concentrates . Forages are quite low in phosphorus , as indicated in Table 3.2 . Plants grown on soils low in phosphorus or harvested at advanced stages of maturity are lacking in this element . In contrast , legume forages are relatively rich sources of calcium . Grasses are appreciably lower in calcium , containing one-third to one-half as much as legumes . Calcium , while reduced in mature forages , is not affected as severely as phosphorus . Concentrates vary somewhat in their contributions of calcium and phosphorus . Cereal grains contain a fair amount of phosphorus but are poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly wheat bran and middlings , are important sources of phosphorus . The oil-seed meals are also good sources of phosphorus but are low in calcium . Vitamin Content of Feeds Vitamin A , as supplied by its precursor carotene , is the vitamin of most concern in rations for mature ruminants . The carotene content of several feeds is shown in Table 3.2 . All forages which exhibit some green color contain carotene , and if some color is still present in hay or silage , it will usually supply adequate amounts of carotene . However degree of green color does not always indicate the relative amount of carotene present . Yellow corn also serves as a source of carotene . Vitamin D is found in adequate amounts in plant products only after exposure to sunlight after normal life processes have stopped . Sun-cured hay , while varying a great deal , contains appreciable amounts of vitamin D. Feed Additives A great many substances other than naturally occurring plants and their by-products are frequently offered for use in rations Oof dairy // cattle . A number of these are listed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or other simple sources of nitrogen . Useful when fed as recommended in the section on practical rations . Vitamin A or D preparations . Useful when a deficiency is present and in rations for young calves . Hormones . Not shown to benefit dairy cattle , except possibly thyroidactive materials under very specific conditions . Yeasts . Not shown to benefit dairy cattle , except irradiated yeast as a source of vitamin D. Complex mineral mixtures . Of value only in geographic areas where deficiencies occur . Enzyme preparations . Present research information shows no benefit for dairy cattle . Rumen bacteria preparations . No benefit demonstrated by present research results . Feed flavoring agents . Present research information indicates little or no effect on intake by dairy cattle . DEVELOPING PRACTICAL AND ECONOMICAL RATIONS The task of developing practical and economical rations may be defined as one of evaluating all the nutrient needs of the animal in question and filling them from feeds which are palatable , provide necessary physical characteristics , and are the least expensive available . Considerable variation in rations for dairy cows is possible owing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed by the host animal . Rates and Types of Forage Feeding Forage forms the basis of all ruminant rations , and minimum amounts are essential for normal function of the digestive tract of dairy cattle . In some areas , energy from forages is cheaper than that from concentrates . Here it is common practice to allow free access to them and to supply supplemental nutrients from concentrates . Under this system , forage consumption will vary widely . If poor-quality material is provided , as little as one pound per 100 pounds of body weight per day may be eaten . When high-quality , early-cut forages are available , consumption may reach three and one-half to four pounds per 100 pounds of body weight per day . Interestingly , recent research observations indicate that free-choice consumption of forages is closely related to nutrient content . This means that more energy is available from each pound of forages eaten at high rates than from those less readily eaten . // The most reliable method of obtaining estimates on rate of consumption of a given forage is a feeding trial . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good understanding of forage quality . Accurate records of the amount of forage actually consumed are essential . Date of harvest appears to be a critical factor in forage quality , particularly for the first harvest in the spring . Research data indicate a decline in dry-matter digestiblity of approximately 0.5 per cent per day for forages during the period of first growth . In some instances there appears to be an advantage in feeding producing cows a few pounds of top-quality forage each day . When forages are in short supply or expensive , it may be profitable to reduce their intake and feed additional concentrates . However , reducing forage consumption below 10 to 12 pounds of hay-equivalent per bead per day may result in the cow going off feed , with a drop in production and also decreased fat percentage in the milk . All forages fed to lactating cows , whether home-grown or purchased , must be free of pesticides which may occur as residues in the milk . Silage versus hay for dairy cows . Corn silage is well liked by cattle and may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the forage in this form . Hay-crop silage , when of good quality , is well liked by cattle and may also be fed heavily . Some research has indicated that better forage consumption and production are obtained when considerable hay is offered along with grass silage . Even with highly palatable corn silage , five or six pounds of additional forage dry matter will usually be eaten each day if some dry hay is offered . In comparing the feeding value of silage and hay , one pound of hay is usually considered equivalent to three or three and one-half pounds of silage . This is to allow for the difference in moisture content . Pasture for dairy cattle . Fresh green pasture forage is highly palatable to dairy cattle and is an economical source of nutrients . Production is well supported by good pastures . However , rapidly growing pasture may be so high in water content that it supplies inadequate nutrien. ' s even though the cows are full . Frequently , as hot weather approaches , pastures stop growing and supply only limited feed . Under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintain production . The activity of cows on pasture increases the energy required for maintenance in proportion to the amount of work involved . As much as 40 per cent increase in maintenance requirement may occur . Green chop or soiling for dairy cows . The practice of chopping green feed and hauling to dairy cows has created considerable interest . This provides a satisfactory source of forage if the fresh material is handled so that it does not heat or ferment . The economical u$e of this // practice depends upon whether the additional 20 or 30 per cent of nutrients harvested from a pasture crop pays for the labor , equipment , and management factors involved . Rates of Feeding and Types of Concentrates The function of the concentrate portion of a dairy ration is to supplement nutrients supplied by forages . Energy , protein , and minerals are the nutrients usually considered . Determining energy needs . The need for supplemental energy usually determines the amount of concentrate to be fed . The amount of energy needed in the concentrate may be expressed in several ways . Ratios @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low producers while not providing enough for high producers . Calculations based upon maintenance requirement , amount , and fat test of milk , as shown in the section on sample rations , may be used . Perhaps a sounder way of determining concentrate needs is to feed at the rate of one pound of concentrates to each two to two and one-half pounds of milk produced , in addition to that supported by nutrients from forage . Underfeeding of energy to dairy cows is probably the most frequent nutrient deficiency observed in this field . The response of the individual cow is extremely important in arriving at the most economical level of concentrates to supply . Table 3.1 shows the average requirement for energy to produce milk . The actual utilization of energy for this purpose is probably more accurately expressed by Figure 2.8 , page 37 . It may he seen here that , at higher feeding rates , as the level of intake increases , there is a diminishing rate of return in milk production . The most profitable level of concentrate feeding for a given cow is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just more than paid for by the milk produced as a result of its inclusion in the ration . Controlling feeding to this degree requires intensive management and close attention to the program . Determining protein needs . Protein levels to be fed are calculated in a manner similar to energy levels . Knowledge of the amount of concentrate to be fed and the amount of protein needed makes it possible to calculate the percentage of protein needed in the grain mixture . Sample calculations are shown below . Concentrate mixtures are usually made up to contain 12 , 14 , 16 , or more per cent of crude protein . In calculating the protein content of rations , the significance of digestible and of total protein should be kept in mind . A good point to remember is that an entire ration of forage and concentrate containing 11 to 12 per cent total protein will usually be adequate for dairy cows . ender practical feeding conditions , it is seldom // necessary to employ a concentrate ration above 16 per cent in protein , except when corn silage or other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forages low in protein ( except corn silage ) will be poorly consumed , and if enough energy is supplied in the form of a concentrate mixture containing 16 per cent protein , this nutrient will also be adequate . Mixtures containing 12 per cent protein , or less , are recommended for cows fed : ( 1 ) early-cut legumes ( hay or silage ) with or without corn silage , or ( 2 ) legume pasture or an excellent growing grass pasture . As soon as grass pasture begins to mature , change to a higher protein mixture . Mixtures containing 14 per cent protein are recommended for cows fed : ( 1 ) part legume and part non-legume hay or silage , or ( 2 ) on a mixed grass-legume pasture where the grasses are in bloom . Mixtures containing 16 per cent protein are recommended for cows fed : ( 1 ) non-legume hay or silage , or ( 2 ) grass pastures past the bloom stage . Mixtures containing 18 to 20 per cent protein are recommended for cows fed : ( 1 ) corn silage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palatable but low-protein non-legume hay or other forage . In many instances where legume forages are used , the protein needs will be exceeded by the forage alone . In these cases any concentrate source to provide energy is satisfactory if it is palatable . There is no danger to the animal in overfeeding protein . Urea and similar sources of nitrogen may be used to supply a portion of the total protein requirements of ruminants . Care should be taken that urea is uniformly mixed in the feed . It should supply not over 30 per cent of the total protein equivalent consumed . Urea should not be included in amounts exceeding three per cent by weight of a mixture , to be fed dairy cattle , or five per cent in a protein concentrate designed to be mixed with other grains . The specific ingredients to be used in a concentrate mixture can vary widely . Cost should be one of the major deciding factors . Frequently mixtures utilizing large amounts of grain grown in the local area are most economical . Determining mineral needs . The usual recommendation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent icommon salt and one per cent steamed bone meal or dicalcium phosphate . Salt and a source of calcium and phosphate may also be supplied free-choice . In areas where specific deficiencies exist , trace minerals may be added . If economical sources are used , all the trace minerals needed by cattle can be supplied for a few cents per ton of concentrate mixture r ' Feeding Dairy Cattle 67 CALCULATING RATIONS As previously stated , calculating practical rations for cattle consists of establishing the nutritive requirements and adjusting the amounts of available feeds to supply them . The following examples show a simple method of doing this . Table 3.3 contains a tabulation of the relative amounts of nutrients which should be present in the rations of mature dairy animals . Example 1 Assume that you need a feeding program for a herd of cows averaging 1 , 2.00 pounds in weight and producing an average of 45 pounds of milk per day . Forage available consists of average alfalfa hay and good-quality corn silage . Enough is on hand to feed 15 pounds of hay and O @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TDN , DP , minerals , and carotene are taken from Table ; 3.1 . ' I'I ) N for maintenance // is 8.0 pounds per day : for milk production , 14.4 pounds per day ; total , 22.4 pounds per day . Requirements for other nutrients are calculated in a similar manner . Nutrient contributions of each feed are from Table 3.2 . The amount of concentrate needed may be calculated by dividing the amount of TDN desired , but not supplied by forage , by the TDN content of the concentrate ; as in the example : 72 x 100 = 14 pounds of concentrate needed . The percentage of digestible protein needed in the concentrate may be calculated by dividing pounds of digestible protein desired , but not supplied by forage , by the pounds of concentrate to be fed . From the example : ( 14 ) x 100 = 6.5% digestible protein needed in the concentrate mixture . A wide variety of ingredients may be used to provide suitable concentrate mixtures . Figure 3.2 is a work sheet which may be used to develop mixtures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit the requirements in the abo4. example might be done as follows : // It should be noted that the calcium and carotene requirements are covered by the forage ; thus , additional amounts are not necessary in the concentrate . However , additional phosphorus from the concentrate is needed . The protein content is adequate from the natural grains . If this were not the case , a high-protein feed such as soybean meal should be included . Table 3.5 includes several rations which will provide adequate nutrition for dairy animals . Determining the Most Economical Ingredients In many instances it may be necessary to purchase some or all of the ingredients used in a concentrate mixture . Table 3.6 contains information on the relative value of several feed ingredients based upon their energy content . Ground shelled corn is used as the basis of comparison . To find the value of a particular feed in relation to corn , look at Table 3.6 and find the column headed by the figure that is nearest to the current price of corn . Then read straight down to the line for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table for the feed in question is higher than the market price for that feed , it is a better buy than corn . If the price in the table is lower than the market price , corn is the better buy . By checking several feeds in this manner , the most economical ones on an energy basis can be found . Current market prices can be interpolated between those given in Table 3.6 . Determining Whether Forages or Concentrates Are A Better Buy There are a number of situations where a dairyman must decide whether to use forages or concentrates to complete a ration . After the minimum needs for forage have been filled , the decision as to which to use may be based on the cost of energy from the two sources . Table 3.7 contains information which is helpful in making this decision . To find the value of a particular forage in comparison with an average grain mixture ( 72 per cent TDN ) , locate the column in Table 3.7 closest to your cost of an average grain mixture . Read down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table is higher than the market value of the forage in question , it is a better buy than the concentrate mixture . If the value in the table is lower than the market value of the forage , the concentrate mixture is the better buy . Interpolation between the prices shown may he necessary to adjust to the market prices found at any given time . // 4 Reproduction in Dairy Cattle REGULAR reproduction in a dairy herd is essential for efficient milk production and is one of the most important contributions to a successful operation . If the herd manager is to achieve and maintain satisfactory reproductive efficiency , he must have an understanding of the basic anatomy and physiology involved . The abnormalities and diseases affecting reproduction must also be familiar to him . Perfect fertility implies that the female is producing normal healthy eggs in numbers common to the species , that each of the eggs is capable of being fertilized by a normal sperm cell , and that the environment in the reproductive tract is such that all the fertilized eggs develop into vigorous , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produces sufficient numbers of normal healthy sperm to make fertilization of the egg possible at each mating or insemination . Mating must take place at the proper time to bring the sperm and egg together when both are vigorous and active . The production of offspring at the ideal rate is difficult to achieve . Indeed , at present it requires nearly two breedings for each pregnancy in dairy cattle . REPRODUCTIVE PHYSIOLOGY OF THE FEMALE Anatomy of the Reproductive Tract The major components of the female reproductive tract are the ovaries , fallopian tubes , uterus , consisting of the body and two horns , the cervix , vagina , and vulva . The arrangement of these organs is presented in diagrammatic form in Figure 4.1 . The Ovaries are the basic reproductive organs in the female , serving as the source of the egg and of essential hormones . They are located in the abdominal cavity on either side of the midline of the back in the area of the hip bones . In the mature cow they are approximately ' % inch in diameter . At birth the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individually and are shed ( luring each reproductive cycle . 74 // Each egg develops in a fluid filled sac on the ovary called a follicle . In addition to the developing egg the follicle produces a hormone , estrogen , which will be discussed further in regard to its importance in reproduc tion . The ripened follicle bursts and releases an egg approximately 12 hours after the end of each heat period . At the site of the ruptured follicle a structure develops which is called the corpus luteum or yellow body . It is responsible for progesterone , an-other hormone important in reproduction . The fallopian tubes , or oviducts , provide the connecting link be tween the ovary and the horns of the uterus . They are convoluted tubules with a fan-like end ( infundibulum ) which partially surrounds the ovary . Under normal conditions , when the egg is released from the follicle it drops into the infundibulum and is moved by cilia through the tube to the uterus . Fertilization , the union of the sperm and the egg , normally takes place in the upper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the uterus to meet the descending egg . // The uterus is a muscular organ consisting of a body and two horns . It is located on the midline of the animal at the rear of the abdominal cavity . During pregnancy in cattle it extends well forward in the abdomen on the right side . The lining of the uterus is heavily supplied with blood vessels and in cattle is characterized by a large number of caruncles or button-like elevations . Membranes from the developing embryo become fastened to these caruncles , and nourishment for the fetus passes from the blood of the dam to the blood of the fetus at these points . The cervix is the term given to the thick walled muscular projection surrounding the mouth of the uterus . It is characterized by a strong sphincter muscle which keeps the opening closed at all times except during parturition . During pregnancy a thick mucous plug seals the cervix . The vagina is the tubular canal connecting the uterus to the external opening or vulva . The urethral canal opens into the vagina for the excretion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clitoris ) projects into the posterior floor of the vagina . The Estrus Cycle The reproductive life of cattle , like other animals is characterized by a series of cycles . These cycles begin at puberty or sexual maturity . The estrus ( or sexual ) cycle in cattle is completed approximately every 21 days . As with all biological activities , there may be considerable variation with individuals . Pregnancy , of course , interrupts the cycle . In the sexually mature non-pregnant female there is a period of preparation for mating and ovulation ( release of the egg ) . During this period blood supply to the lining of the uterus is increased . The follicle and egg are maturing . The secretion of estrogen from the follicle into the blood stream causes the cow to accept the service of the male . At this time the animal is " in heat . " Figure 4.2 illustrates the activities symptomatic of the heat period . " Standing heat " normally lasts for 12 ' to 18 hours . Since the egg is released approximately 12 hours after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limited life in the female reproductive tract , breeding should take place during the last half of the heat period . Following ovulation the corpus luteum ( yellow body ) forms at the site of the broken follicle . The hormone progesterone , found in this structure , helps prepare the uterus for maintaining the growing embryo . The corpus luteum is essential for the maintenance of pregnancy , at least until the latter part of the period . If fertilization of the egg does not occur , the corpus Intenm begins to recede after a short period . The uterus returns to a resting state and the cycle is repeated . // If fertilization occurs , cell division starts immediately to develop the new animal and the membranes which surround it . The fertilized egg is moved into the horn of the uterus where development takes place . During its early , life the embryo obtains its nourishment from a milky fluid secreted by the lining of the uterus . By about 35 to 40 days after fertilization the placental membranes have developed sufficiently to transport nutrients from the blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The embryo continues to grow until , at the end of approximately 283 days , the fully developed calf is born . The operation of a normal sexual cycle is an extremely complex ac tivity which is not completely understood . In addition to hormones from the ovaries those from the pituitary gland , adrenals , and the placenta are involved . The interaction of these hormones is probably as important as the absolute amounts present . Follicle Stimulating Hormone ( FSH ) from the pituitary gland is believed to cause the follicle to develop . Estrogen , from the follicle , when it is at a relatively high level in the blood stream , decreases the pro duction of FSH by the pituitary . The pituitary now releases a substance which causes the follicle to rupture . Luteinizing Hormone ( LH ) , also from the pituitary , is responsible for the maintenance and function of the corpus luteum . Hormones from the placenta play a part here , since if pregnancy does not take place , the corpus luteum soon degenerates . // REPRODUCTIVE PHYSIOLOGY OF THE MALE Anatomy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reproductive tract consists of the testes , epididymis , vas deferens , seminal vesicles , prostrate gland , bulbo-urethral or Cowpers glands , urethra , and penis . Figure 4.3 is a diagram showing the relative location of these organs . The testes are the primary reproductive organs in the male and perform the dual function of producing sperm and acting as the source of the male hormone , testosterone . Testosterone is responsible for the secondary sexual characteristics , such as the crest , in the bull . Accessory sex glands and the penis fail to develop normally in the absence of testosterone . Each testicle is normally located in an individual compartment of the scrotum which is outside the body cavity . Sperm production does not take place at internal body temperature , and the scrotum acts to provide the optimum temperature for this function . Sperm cells originate from the multiplication and maturing of cells lining small canals found in the testes , known as seminiferous tubules . They move through these tubules into the r'pididynnis whicho consists of a single mach-coiled tubule . Tlcre the sperm calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage where they are capable of fertilizing ova . The epididymis apparently acts as a storage area for mature sperm . Figure 4.4 is a photograph of sperm from a bull as seen under a microscope . The vas deferens serves as a connecting duct between the epididymis and the urethra for the transport of sperm and seminal fluid . It also contains glands which contribute to the fluid portion of the semen . The seminal vesicles lie alongside the reproductive tract and provide a secretion which enters the urethra along with the material from the vas deferens . The prostrate gland surrounds the urethra and also provides a secre tion which contributes to the fluid portion of the semen . This secretion apparently acts on the fluid to increase the activity of the sperm . The bulbo-urethral , or Cowpers glands are found on either side of the urethra . The function of the secretion which they provide is not well understood . The urethra is a duct running from the bladder through the penis of the male and performs the dual function of eliminating urine and trans-porting the semen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the copulatory organ of the male which carries the urethra , through which the semen is deposited in the reproductive tract // of the female . The penis is a muscular organ containing areas of spongy tissue which become filled with blood in preparation for copulation . Little increase in the size of the copulatory organ occurs , but the quick thrust , typical of cattle , at copulation is facilitated by relaxation of the retractor penis muscle and the straightening out of the sigmoid ( Sshaped ) flexure . Semen Production As indicated previously , semen is composed of sperm cells and supporting fluids from a number of glands . In the bull a normal ejaculate amounts to about 5 or 6 cc . This will contain from 2 to 14 billion sperm cells . Research has indicated that 10,000,000 sperm cells are sufficient to assure fertilization under normal conditions . The use of artificial insemination , which is discussed in Chapter 5 , is based upon the tremendous numbers of cells produced at one time . The total capability of the male for semen production is not well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce enough semen for mating or collecting two or more times per week over extended periods of time . ABNORMALITIES OF REPRODUCTION CAUSING DECREASED FERTILITY OR STERILITY Anything which causes dysfunction of the reproductive system results in decreased fertility , or , when reproduction is impossible , complete sterility . Decreased fertility or sterility is not a disease or condition in itself but a symptom of some specific situation which must be corrected before normal fertility can be regained . All degrees of fertility are found in nature , from complete inability to reproduce to complete fertility . Abnormalities affecting reproduction may be classified in three groups : ( 1 ) structural defects , ( 2 ) physiological defects , and ( 3 ) infectious diseases . Each of these will be considered briefly . Structural Defects In the female there are a number of structural defects of a congenital nature which prevent reproduction . However , these occur rarely . Incomplete vaginas , improperly formed uteri , closed cervices and other malformations are among possible defects . Some of these are inherited , and the frequency of occurrence may he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear normal and have regular heat periods . A condition called infantile ovaries , in which thN ovaries // fail to develop and produce eggs , sometimes occurs . Normal heat periods do not take place . This is sometimes associated with general underdevelopment as a result of poor feeding . In some cases treatment with hormones is effective . Heifers born twin to a bull are sterile in about 90 per cent of the cases . This type of animal is known as a freemartin . The reproductive tract is incomplete and never develops . No treatment is effective . In suspicious cases , a heifer calf may be checked by gently pushing the rounding end of a test tube or the eraser end of a pencil into the vagina . If penetration is stopped in a short distance in comparison with the penetration possible with a normal calf , the animal is a freemartin . In the male the most common structural defect is cryptorchidism ( undescended testes ) . In this condition the testicles remain in the abdominal cavity and do not descend to the scrotum . Bulls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are sterile . Sterility is attributed to the inability to produce living sperm at internal body temperatures . Bulls with one undescended testicle are fertile but should be screened carefully in a breeding program , since the condition is inherited and sterile male offspring frequently result . Bulls may have incomplete formation of parts of the reproductive tract similar to abnormalities mentioned for heifers . These are usually incomplete ducts or malformations of the penis . Hermaphroditism or mixing of the sexes in a single individual is a cause of sterility . However , it is a rarity in cattle , occurring much less frequently than in goats or swine . Physical injuries resulting from wounds , infections occurring in either sex , or tearing of the uterus during parturition may cause sterility in cattle . Physiological Abnormalities In the female , dysfunction of the ovary is a cause of lowered fertility . Some cows exhibit a condition of nymphomania ( constant or frequent heat ) . This condition results from " cystic ovaries " or failure of the follicle to break and release the egg at the normal time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irritation of the uterus may cause an action upon the ovary which keeps the follicle intact . Secretions from the follicle in turn keep the uterus in a high state of activity and a vicious cycle is set up . Treatment by a veterinarian in the form of injection of chorionic gonadotrophin , which causes disappearance of the cyst , or manual rupturing can be used . Neither treatment is completely effective , but something like 50 per cent of treated animals conceive when bred at // the first heat after treatment . It is important to treat this disorder as soon as possible after it is discovered . Persistence of the yellow body on the ovary in the non-pregnant animal results in the absence of heat . Some irritation of the uterus is present when this condition exists , which apparently has hormonal re sults similar to pregnancy . The persistent yellow body may be removed by hormonal treatment or manual expression . However , this should be done only after careful examination of the cow to determine that she is not pregnant . Also , careful observation should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a silent heat . Silent heat is a situation where ovulation occurs but is not preceded by the usual symptoms indicated in Figure 4.2 . Current belief is that silent heats are responsible for an appreciable percentage of infertility . Closer than usual observation of the cow is necessary . A bloody discharge on the tail or vulva indicates the cow passed a heat period about 2 days previously , and she should be watched carefully in about 18 days . In the male , physiological dysfunctions are less frequently observed . While they probably exist , little is known about them . Poor quality sperm or low fertility of certain bulls are undoubtedly a result of physiological malfunctioning in some cases . DISEASES AFFECTING REPRODUCTION A number of infectious organisms may invade the reproductive tract and result in decreased fertility through disease . These diseases , which include brucellosis , vibriosis , trichomoniasis , and leptospirosis , are cov ered in detail in Chapter 9 . Some information on each is presented here . Brucellosis is characterized by abortion in the last third of pregnancy . It may be prevented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The disease is transmissible to humans , and federal and state eradi cation programs have made excellent progress in eliminating it . If un- ' explainable abortions occur late in gestation , examination or testing for brucellosis should be conducted . Vaccination of young calves and slaughter of older infected animals are the recommended control pro cedures . Vibriosis also causes abortions , frequently so early in gestation that they go unnoticed . It is a true venereal disease , spread by mating . De layed heat periods , caused by the abortions , and many services per conception are symptoms . Bulls may become infected and pass on the disease for many years . The use of proper antibiotics in the semen diluter used in artificial insemination provides good control of vibriosis. // Trichomoniasis infection frequently results in abortion . As with vibriosis , it occurs early in pregnancy , usually during the first 16 weeks . The organism infects the uterus and the sheath of the bull . It is spread by mating . The disease is sometimes difficult to diagnose because of the problem of identifying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be controlled in cows but only with great difficulty in bulls . Leptospirosis is a disease which has a number of effects and symptoms , one of which is abortion occurring usually in later stages of pregnancy . The disease is spread by several means , but apparently is not transmitted through the semen when artificial insemination is used . Leptospirosis can be controlled by vaccination which is effective for several months . Vaccination is recommended for cattle being introduced into a herd , or coming in contact with animals from other areas . Non-specific infections of the reproductive tract from a number of organisms may interfere with reproduction . These may cause abortion or prevent implantation of the embryo in the uterus . Dead tissue in the uterus from failure of a cow to clean properly provides an excellent breeding ground for bacteria . The presence of a colored or pus-like discharge from the reproductive tract is an indication of infection and should always be investigated by a veterinarian and treated if necessary . Infections of the vagina , called vaginitis , are also considered responsible for infertility in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blamed on poor nutrition . Serious deficiency of specific vitamins and minerals , such as phosphorus or Vitamin A , has been shown to result in lowered fertility . However , in most carefully observed cases other deficiency symptoms are apparent by the time reproductive efficiency is affected . Cattle on normal well-balanced rations which include the usually recommended nutrients receive adequate nutrition for reproduction . Correcting inadequate or unbalanced rations with common feedstuffs and supplements is cheaper and equally as effective as using tonics or expensive mineral mixtures . Research has shown that the plane of nutrition , particularly the energy level , influences the speed at which cattle reach sexual maturity . Six or more months difference in age at first heat has been observed in heifers fed approximately 130 per cent of recommended allowances compared to those fed approximately 60 per cent of the recommended standard . Heifers fed at approximately 90 per cent of the standard showed first heat at about 49 weeks . // INHERITANCE OF FERTILITY The question is often raised in regard to the possibility of improving breeding efficiency by selection . Present information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for general fertility . There are a number of specific abnormalities , several of which have been previously mentioned , which are inherited and should be selected against . Abnormal development of the young animal , so that it dies before or shortly after birth , is a cause of inefficient reproduction . Several specific abnormalities are well known . Many of these are inherited as simple recessive factors . Bulldog calves , hairlessness , short spine , fused nostrils , dwarfism , and hydrocephaly are among " lethals " which are well recognized . Because of the recessive nature of these factors , inbreeding tends to concentrate them . It has been observed that a number of fertilized eggs are lost at a very early stage of development , and that this can not be accounted for by known diseases . This may be a result of abnormalities of such a nature that the embryo can not develop . While it is recognized that a significant portion of infertility is due to early embryonic death , the specific causes and contributing factors are not known . MANAGING DAIRY CATTLE FOR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affecting it into a good management program should be the goal of every dairyman . The following suggested practices should provide a basis for such a program . Proper management for reproduction starts with the growing calf . Animals of either sex which are to be used for breeding purposes should be kept constantly in a healthy , vigorous condition . Optimum Age for Beginning Reproduction The level of feeding has a great influence upon when cattle reach sexual maturity , as described in the section on nutrition and fertility . Recommendations for breeding heifers the first time are frequently given in terms of age ; however , weight is probably even more important . Heifers which have been underfed should not be bred until they have reached proper size . The long-time effect of breeding very well-fed heifers at an early age has not been thoroughly studied . If heifers can be brought into production earlier with no shortening of productive life this would have a marked economic advantage . Recommended ages and weights for breeding heifers are included in Table 4.1. // Heifers of the larger breeds show the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guernsey heifers at a somewhat lighter weight . Detecting heat in cattle requires careful observation and some ex perience . The symptoms shown in Figure 4.2 should be watched for in all non-pregnant animals . Accurate records should be kept of any animals in heat so that their reproductive cycle can be checked and breeding be done at the desirable time . The occurrence of a bloody discharge on the vulva or tail of a cow indicates that she was in heat about two days previously and should be watched carefully in about 18 days . Research results have shown that silent heat periods occur with a number of cows . That is , they go through the period of ovulation but exhibit little or none of the activity normally expected . Particularly careful observation and accurate records are im portant in these cases , because cows usually conceive when bred at the proper time . The period during the reproductive cycle when the highest conception rate can be expected is shown in Figure 4.2 . Animals which have been bred and have not returned to heat for 40 to 60 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the rectal wall . This check should be conducted , on a routine basis , by a veterinarian . An enlarged uterus usually indicates pregnancy . Diagnosis is difficult prior to 30 days . Checking at this time usually reveals those animals which are not pregnant but have not returned to heat because of some abnormality or which have passed through silent heats . Several chemical and biological tests have been devised to de termine pregnancy . At present none are practical . A regular program of preventative medicine in conjunction with preg nancy checks should be worked out with a veterinarian . Reproduction disorders , like others , respond best to treatment when it is started early . Animals that have calved should be bred at the first heat occurring 60 clays after parturition . Approximately two months are required for the reproductive tract to return to normal after calving . Time is needed // for the removal of inflammation and congestion as well as return of proper muscular tone . Fertilization may take place prior to 60 days post partum , but an abnormally large number of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early fertilizations . Thus , longer rather than shorter calving intervals frequently result from breeding cows too soon after parturition . The pregnant heifer and cow should be fed according to recommendations in the chapter on feeding . Care should be taken to prevent injuries from fighting , narrow doors , falls or other situations which may result in abortion . The period of gestation in cattle is approximately 9 months . However , there is considerable variation between breeds and between individuals in a bred . Brown Swiss cattle carry their calves the longest , about 290 days , Guernseys carry calves about 283 days , Ayrshires , Jerseys and Holsteins about 279 days . Male calves are usually carried about a day longer than females . Calves born within 10 days of these periods may be considered normal . Calves born after 7 months of pregnancy frequently live but need special care during early life . Adequate care at calving time is important in assuring continued fertility of a cow . Symptoms that an animal is about to calve include swelling of the udder ( which may start several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , swelling of the vulva , and a dropping away of the ligaments around the tail head . As calving approaches the cow becomes uneasy and straining is obvious . Clean , sanitary , and quiet surroundings are ideal for the cow at parturition . An adequate box stall is appropriate . Calving on pasture is satisfactory and often desirable . Birth usually takes place in one or two hours . Normally the forelegs are presented first with the head resting on top and between them . If the calf is not delivered in a reasonable time and the presentation is normal , assistance may be given by pulling on the forelegs in conjunction with the muscular contractions of the cow . Abnormal presentations or continued labor with no evidence of birth require the attention of a veterinarian . Immediately following birth , the mouth and nostrils should be checked to determine that they are free of mucus so that normal breathing can occur . A normal , healthy calf will be on its feet and eating within 30 minutes after birth . Care and management of the calf are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or afterbirth , will be expelled a few hours following birth . If they are not expelled in 12 to 15 hours they should be removed by a trained person . It is important to carefully separate the membranes from the caruncles in the uterus . Pulling or jerking them free can permanently damage the caruncles so tll t future // pregnancies afe jeopardized . Cattle left to themselves will frequently eat the placenta , so it may not be found . The reproductive tract should be observed closely following calving . If bloody or pus-containing discharges persist , the cow should be examined to diagnose the cause , and treatment should be carried out promptly . Following calving , heat periods should be observed and recorded so that the next pregnancy may be started at the desirable time . Feeding at calving time . The cow or heifer should be brought to calving in good flesh so that she is well prepared for the ensuing lactation . At the time of calving the cow should be provided with plenty of good quality forage and adequate grain . No advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Grain feeding should be maintained and increased as rapidly as the cow will accept it after the calf is born . Calving , followed immediately by the onset of heavy lactation , develops considerable stress in a cow . Providing adequate nutrition is important in helping the cow meet this stress . Research conducted at several stations has demonstrated that the kind or amount of grain fed does not affect the udder edema or congestion frequently observed at calving time . Milking at calving . The calf should be allowed to nurse as soon after birth as it is able . It is a frequent and satisfactory management practice to leave the calf with the cow for the first two or three days after birth . Then the udder should be milked out , and complete milking at the usual intervals should begin . The colostrum should , of course , not be put in the regular milk supply until normal characteristics appear , usually at the sixth and subsequent milkings . Pre-milking , or milking previous to calving , is sometimes practiced , particularly in cases where there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is apparently achieved by this practice . When this is done , the colostrum is not available at the time the calf is born and special provisions should be made to supply it . Colostrum may be stored frozen or obtained from other fresh cows in the herd . Udder edema is discussed in detail under diseases , but is of sufficient importance to be mentioned here . It is an accumulation of fluid in the tissues surrounding the udder . In severe cases it may extend completely along the abdomen . It occurs most frequently at calving , but some cows exhibit symptoms throughout much of the lactation . The cause is unknown . Tendency toward udder edema is apparently inherited to some extent . Severe cases may result in breakdown of udder supports , making , machine milking difficult and leaving the udder susceptible to injury . No really effective treatment is available . Massage and the use of hot and cold compresses on the udder are frequently suggested . // MANAGEMENT OF REPRODUCTION IN THE MALE Healthy , well grown bull calves are one of the best assurances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consideration in selecting bulls is ability to pass on desirable characteristics , as discussed in Chapter 8 . Once a desirable bull is chosen , he should be managed for a long lifetime of producing reasonable numbers of normal sperm . Effect of feed on reproductive performance . Bulls should be fed adequately to keep them in good flesh but not overly fat . Figure 4.5 shows a mature bull in good service condition . Since the nutritive requirements of reproduction are less than for lactation , forage quality and other factors are not as critical for bulls . They should , however , be supplied a well balanced ration . Since the usual feedstuffs can be combined into adequate rations , the use of tonics and expensive mineral mixtures is not recommended . // One pound of good quality hay equivalent and one-half pound of concentrates per 100 pounds of body weight , per day , will keep a mature bull in good breeding condition . The level of nutrition has a marked effect upon the age at which young bulls reach sexual maturity . Bulls raised in a Cornell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 90 , and 130 per cent of the recommended allowance produced viable semen at 51 , 43 , and 37 weeks of age , respectively . Young bulls should be separated from heifers at 6 to 8 months of age to prevent unintended conception . Rate of usage . The ability of bulls to produce satisfactory semen is not as well understood as the egg-producing capacity of cows . There may be considerable individual variation among bulls in this capacity . It is a common practice to start using young bulls at about a year of age . Ten to fifteen services during the first year are frequently recommended . Older bulls are usually used for 40 to 50 services a year . In artificial insemination many yearling bulls are used weekly and older bulls twice weekly with no apparent detrimental effects . In some instances bulls have been used several times a day for short periods with no observable decrease in semen producing ability . Housing for bulls . All bulls should be considered dangerous animals and handled as such . Safety pens and stalls are essential . The bull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provisions should be made for sunlight and exercise . Special attention should be given to foot care and trimming . Large bulls should be trained to use a breeding rack to prevent injury to themselves or to cows on which they may be used . SUMMARY OF PROCEDURES FOR IMPROVING BREEDING EFFICIENCY 1 . Maintain and use accurate and complete records on the reproductive history of all animals . 2 . Conduct a routine program of pregnancy checks in co-operation with a veterinarian. 3 . Conduct a routine program of disease prevention and control with a veterinarian. 4 . Check all non-pregnant animals for signs of heat at least twice daily . Pay particular attention to the possibility of silent heats . 5 . Breed cows at the first heat 60 days after calving. 6 . Breed young animals at the first heat after they reach the weights indicated in Table 4.1. 7 . Make sure the quality of semen used is adequate . Check semen from bulls used in natural service . // Establish a goal of not over 1.8 services per calf . Maintain adequate nutrition in all animals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calf for each cow every 12 to 13 months . 5 Artificial Insemination of Cattle MEN discovered several hundred years ago that living sperm collected from the male and introduced into the female reproductive tract at the proper time would produce a normal offspring . Spallanzani conducted the first recorded research on artificial insemination , with dogs , in 1783 . Only slight use was made of this valuable technique until very recent times . Except when given special handling , the life of sperm outside the body is short . The development of an understanding of the physiology of cells in general , and particularly knowledge of the sperm cell , was necessary before artificial insemination could be employed on a practical basis . The first commercial organization for artificial insemination of cattle in this country started operation in New Jersey in 1938 . This operation was based on experience gained from several years of practice in Northern Europe . Since then the practice has spread so that it is available to cattle in the entire country . Over one-third of the dairy calves now born each year are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a number of opportunities ter improve efficiency . It makes possible " selected matings " involving outstanding cows and bulls which may be located at considerable distances . Both outcrossing and linebreeding may be practiced more easily . Probably the greatest contribution of artificial insemination lies in extending the use of outstanding bulls . A sire proven to be a transmitter of desirable characteristics may be mated to thousands of cows . In many instances , service from top quality bulls is much cheaper for the individual dairyman than owning and maintaining a bull himself . Another benefit of artificial insemination is the proving of bulls used on large numbers of cows with daughters in a wide range of environments . Production information obtained in this way , and properly analyzed , is the most reliable information available on the transmitting ability of bulls . Several diseases associated with reproduction are more easily controlled or eliminated when artificial insemination is used . 4 ) t // TECHNIQUES USED IN ARTIFICIAL INSEMINATION Collecting and Processing Semen The most frequently used system for collecting semen from a bull is the artificial vagina . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it provides an environment somewhat similar to that of the vagina for the ejaculation of semen and its collection in a test tube In use , the bull is encouraged to mount a " teaser " animal in the normal manner . The operator diverts the penis into the artificial vagina where the ejaculate is trapped in the test tube . Bulls exhibit a great deal of individual variation in their response to teaser animals , and operators of bull studs develop a definite art in learning the characteristics of each animal . The electro-e/aculator is sometimes used to obtain semen from older bulls or those unable to mount because of injury . This device consists of electrodes placed in the rectal cavity in close proximity to the repro ductive tract and the nerves supplying it . A series of electrical impulses stimulates the ejaculation of semen , which may be caught in a beaker or other container . Semen should be processed immediately after collection if it is to be used efficiently . The frequency of collection of semen varies considerably . The most commonly used rate is one collection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bulls are collected two or more times per week with excellent results . There are isolated cases where bulls have been collected many times per day for one or two days without injury . The health , vigor , and age of the bull all play an important part in the frequency of collection which may be used . Current information indicates that collecting yearling bulls once each week and mature bulls twice weekly is not detrimental to semen quality or continued vigor of many bulls . Evaluation of semen . As produced , there are from 300 million to 2 billion sperm cells per each ml. of a normal 5 to 6 ml. ejaculate . Ten mil-lion active sperm cells are adequate for one insemination . Dilution is usually made to approximately this level in one ml. of final product . // Fresh semen is examined to determine the total numbers of sperm cells present and the percentage of motility . Total numbers may be deter-mined by actual microscopic count . However , this is a tedious process and a more rapid system is to measure the refraction of light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this purpose . The number of sperm cells is inversely proportional to the amount of light passing through the sample . Motility is usually estimated by direct microscopic observation , which is a rather subjective measurement . Motility of 70 per cent of the cells observed is considered to indicate good quality semen . Figure 4.4 , page 80 , shows the appearance of sperm under the microscope . At the same time that motility estimates are made , the cells are observed for ab normalities such as crooked tails , broken bodies , missing tails , etc . Large numbers of abnormal sperm indicate the semen will provide a poor rate of conception . Semen diluters are used to extend the semen to the desired concentra tion of sperm cells . In commercial practice one ml. of diluted semen con taining 10,000,000 or more motile cells is used for each insemination . Dilutors are designed to provide a satisfactory chemical and physical environment for the sperm cells . All of them contain a buffering agent , to maintain pH at about 6.7 to 6.9 , and nutrient material . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yolk . More recently , boiled milk has been used very widely . A number of substances are added to diluters to aid in preservation of the sperm or in concep tion rate . Certain antibiotics are used routinely to aid in disease con trol . Glycerol is used in a number of diluters for both fresh and frozen semen . It aids in making possible good conception rates with fresh semen , 3 and 4 days old . The addition of carbon dioxide to semen diluter decreases the activity in the sperm and extends its storage life . Refrigeration of fresh semen at 40 ? F. is essential with most diluters . Some exploratory work with new diluters indicates that one may be developed which will not require refrigeration . The following are two diluters which have been used for semen . In some operations the milk diluter is used for fresh semen and the egg yolk for frozen semen . // When the milk diluter is used , it should be heated to 200 ? F. , held for 10 minutes , and kept in a sterile condition thereafter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are added . When the milk diluter is to be used , it is divided into two equal parts . All of the glycerin is added to one part , in 3 equal portions at 10-minute intervals . Both parts are refrigerated for at least one and one-half to two hours before using . When the semen is to be added ( immediately after evaluation following collection ) both portions of the diluter are heated in a water bath to 90 ? F. to be as close as possible to the temperature of the semen . The semen is mixed with the portion containing glycerin . The second portion of diluter is then added to the partially diluted semen . The completely diluted semen is then cooled to 38 to 40 ? F. by placing in a refrigerator . After cooling the semen is kept at this temperature until used . The egg yolk diluter is handled in a similar manner except it is not heated . Also it should be allowed to stabilize at 38 ? F. for eight hours or longer before the semen is added . Current practices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or more days before conception rate begins to drop off . This makes it possible to have fresh semen available every day from a given bull if he is collected twice weekly . Each semen processing business has a number of variations in handling semen , but the following is a general description of the technique involved . After collection of the semen it is examined for motility and number of sperm cells to establish the possible dilution rate . Dilution is usually made with both semen and diluter at 85 to 90 ? F. The diluted semen is then cooled slowly to 40 ? F. by storing in a refrigerator in a water bath . Semen should be stored at 40 ? F. for a minimum of 6 hours to allow ample time for antibiotics to be effective . The semen is then placed in labeled vials . Many organizations color the semen of each of the breeds with a harmless dye as an aid in identification . The semen is shipped in refrigerated containers to the technician or central distribution point where it is used . Details of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Frozen Semen For a number of years sperm have been successfully preserved by freezing under carefully controlled conditions . Calves have been born from sperm stored for over 9 years in the frozen state . A mixture of dry ice and alcohol , and liquid nitrogen are two refrigerants used . Dry ice and alcohol has a temperature of - 79 ? C. or - 110 ? F. Liquid nitrogen is at - 176 ? C. or - 320 ? F. Diluted semen is frozen in one ml. ampules which are thawed in cold water , preferably ice water , just previous to time of service . // Special techniques and handling of the semen are necessary during the freezing process to maintain the life of the sperm . After the storage temperature has been reached , warming and cooling of the semen before use endangers the viability of the sperm . Dried Semen . Successful insemination of a cow under laboratory con ditions , using frozen dried semen , has been reported . The procedure , developed by Dr. H. T. Meryman and A. Kafig at the Naval Research Institute , involved dipping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it under vacuum . Water evaporation was rapid enough so that the water remaining in the sample froze . Evaporation continued until the material was dry . The gauze was then placed in standard semen diluter and viable sperm recovered . The sample was used for inseminat ing a cow . Refinement of this technique for practical use could add a very useful tool to the management of dairy cattle reproduction . How-ever , much additional work must be done to make this technique useful under practical conditions . Inseminating the Cow Figure 5.2 shows the technique of artificial insemination in the female . A gloved hand is inserted in the rectal cavity . The reproductive tract is grasped gently , with care taken not to injure it or the intestinal wall . A catheter with a squeeze bulb on the end is filled with semen and in serted in the vagina . By working the catheter and manipulating the cervix with the gloved hand the catheter is moved into the cervix . This is usually possible except in some heifers which have not calved . Semen may be deposited in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // the cervix . Semen is deposited just outside the cervix when it is not possible to penetrate that organ . EFFECTIVENESS OF ARTIFICIAL INSEMINATION When good quality semen and proper techniques are used , conception rates with artificial insemination equal or surpass those obtained in natural breeding . Breeding efficiency for this system is commonly reported as 30 to 60 or 60 to 90 day non-returns to service . The figure used is the percentage of animals bred for which a request has not been received for re-breeding . There are , of course , always a number of animals included which do not conceive but for which no request for re-breeding is made . A non-return rate at 60 to 90 days after breeding of 70 per cent is desirable . Several breeding establishments consistently maintain average non-return rates somewhat above this . The non-return rates for individual bulls vary greatly , depending on the quality of the semen they produce . ARTIFICIAL BREEDING ORGANIZATIONS A majority of the artificial insemination done in this country utilizes semen from bulls owned or leased by artificial breeding organizations . These may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be co-operative in nature , operated for the service of the members . The latter are more numerous . In these organizations bulls are kept in a central location , adjacent to laboratory and office facilities , to allow for processing the semen and maintaining proper records . Technicians employed by the breeding organization are stationed throughout the area served by it . Semen is collected from bulls in the stud on a regular schedule . This is established by the stud management , taking into account the public demand for the bull , his semen-producing capacity , and future plans for his use . Semen is shipped in refrigerated containers to each of the technicians , using whatever means is most efficient in the area served . Dairymen desiring the use of artificial insemination notify the technician , who brings the semen to the farm and performs the breeding . Generally , the technician is responsible for collecting the breeding fee , which , of course , varies with the conditions involved . Current fees average about $6.00 per cow bred . It is the practice of most artificial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of charge if the cow does not conceive . Subsequent services are frequently provided at a reduced rate . // Artificial Insemination in Individual Herds In addition to utilizing the services of breeding organizations , a number of larger operators practice artificial insemination within individual herds where the bull may be present . The advantages of extending the use of bulls , particularly during the heavy breeding season , of disease control , and of the use of bulls unable to mount are available in this system . Semen from outstanding or popular bulls individually owned is frequently marketed for use through artificial insemination . National Association of Artificial Breeders Groups in the business of artificial insemination have formed a national organization for the promotion of artificial breeding and for the obtaining and dissemination of technical and business information concerning it . The organization is called The National Association of Artificial Breeders . Its headquarters are at Columbia , Missouri . A monthly paper , the A.I. Digest , is published by the organization . RECORDS IN ARTIFICIAL INSEMINATION With large amounts of semen from a number of bulls distributed over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identify the sires used in artificial insemination is of great importance to all dairymen . It is an absolute necessity for the purebred breeder . The identity of semen is carefully preserved by all the breeding organizations . The name or number of the bull is attached to or stamped on the individual container used for each shipment . Many organizations identify the semen of each breed with a harmless dye . At the time a cow is bred the technician issues a breeding receipt to the owner . This contains the identification of the cow and the sire , and the date , and is certified by the inseminator . A copy of a typical receipt is presented in Figure 5.3 . Regulations Concerning the Use of Artificial Insemination in Purebred Herds The Purebred Dairy Cattle Association ( P.D.C.A. ) has developed a set of rules and regulations for the use of artificial insemination of purebred cattle from which calves are to be registered . They are too detailed to report completely here but may be found in the reference material listed at the end of the chapter . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calves resulting from artificial insemination with fresh semen from bulls owned within a herd are handled much the same as with natural breeding . When fresh semen is transferred between herds , special application forms must be completed and filed with the breed association . Special contracts are required with each semen producing business , and the signature of each approved inseminator must be on file with the breed associations . A breeding certificate , like the one shown in Figure 5.4 , is required when cows are bred by an inseminator representing a semen producing business . The P.D.C.A. and breed associations reserve the right to cancel contracts , or withdraw approval , of any inseminator when evidence in dicates the rules are not being properly followed . Blood typing is required for all bulls owned by semen producing businesses , and for privately owned bulls from which frozen semen is used . 6 TWENTY to twenty-five per cent of the producing animals leave the average dairy herd each year because of low production , disease , poor breeding efficiency , or other reasons . A continuous supply of goodquality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Well-grown , healthy heifers are the most desirable source of these replacements . Also , sale of foundation stock to other herds is an important part of the business of many dairy enterprises . Adequate care and management must be practiced throughout the life of all heifers to develop them to their full potential . The management of the herd replacement begins before the calf is born by providing it with a well-fed , healthy dam selected for ability to transmit the characteristics desired in the mature animal . Use of a sire with the ability to transmit desirable characteristics is equally important . CARE OF THE CALF AT BIRTH The calf should be born in a sanitary , dry environment . A sanitized maternity stall is the place of choice in most herds . Where space and season are appropriate , birth on a clean pasture or lot is ideal . At birth the mouth and nostrils should be checked and cleared of any material which may interfere with normal breathing . Also it is desirable to sanitize the umbilical cord and the area where it enters the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be on its feet and nursing within thirty minutes after birth . In extreme weather , the calf may be dried off after birth by rubbing with a cloth . However , the dam does a good job of this under usual conditions . It is a good practice to allow the calf to nurse the dam for the first two or three days . However , when certain calfhood diseases are present within the herd , or if it will make handling more efficient , the calf can be taken from the dam immediately . Regardless of the practice followed , the calf should be fed colostrum for i/u first two darts . roil // Housing The calf is best maintained in an individual pen or stall for the first few weeks . This allows more careful attention to individuals and pre-vents calves from sucking each other , which may lead to udder diffi culties at maturity . After about eight weeks of age , it may be handled with a group . Details on space requirements and structures which may be used during the growing period are given in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious problem young calves may be housed in individual portable pens which can be moved frequently . This system of housing is used successfully in many sections of the country . It may be helpful in controlling respiratory infections as well as parasites . Simple structures , providing shelter in line with climatic conditions , with most of the floor area made up by the ground , are ade quate for these pens . FEEDING CALVES AND HEIFERS The feeding program is the most critical factor in the management of the young calf . Nutrient requirements for growing dairy calves and heifers are shown in Table 6.1 . This table also includes desirable rates of gain for them . It should be pointed out that the values in Table 6.1 are minimum requirements , and under farm conditions 10 to 15 per cent more energy and protein may be profitably included to allow for varia tion in feed composition . Table 6.2 contains information on the nutrient composition of total rations and amounts which when fed daily will supply the nutrient re quirements listed in Table 6.1 . More details on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in practical rations are considered later in this chapter . Feeding Young Calves For convenience , systems of feeding young dairy calves may be di vided into four categories . In practice , there are no sharp dividing lines between the systems and many actual feeding programs overlap these categories . They are : // The systems above are listed in order of increasing demand for man-agement skill in raising calves . With good sanitation , little other man-agement is needed when calves are raised on a nurse cow . Considerable attention and skill are needed for the last system . Where market milk is sold , the systems listed are in decreasing order of feed cost . In situa-tions where milk is sold for manufacturing purposes , the milk replacer system is frequently uneconomical . Regardless of what system is used , the newborn calf should receive colostrum , preferably by nursing the dam , for the first 48 hours . The most important contribution of colostrum lies in antibodies associated with the globulin fraction of the protein . The blood of the newborn calf has practically no antibodies and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to survive against several diseases , particularly those creating symptoms in the digestive system . It is also important that colostrum be given early to the calf , since after two days of life it loses the ability to absorb antibodies through the intestinal wall . In addition to antibodies , colostrum is high in total protein , it supplies extra amounts of vitamin A ( if the cow is consuming adequate caro-tene ) and it contributes a laxative effect . If for any reason colostrum from the dam is not available , every effort should be made to obtain it from other sources . Excess colostrum may be frozen and stored for emergencies . Use of nurse cows . Probably the easiest way to raise calves is to allow three or four of them to nurse a cow . Calves should be taught to eat hay and a calf starter ( a grain mixture designed to meet the needs of growing calves ) before weaning . Calves may be carried on this system for as long as six months , or they may be weaned at two or three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of calves to the production of the cow . If the calf is weaned at two or three months , it should be eating at least two pounds of a calf starter per day and appreciable amounts of good-quality hay at that time , if it is to maintain reasonable growth . At this age up to four pounds of calf starter per day may be fed if the calf will consume it . Raising calves on whole or skim milk . When the calf is removed from its dam , it may be fed by teaching it to drink , or the milk may be given in a nipple pail . Milk of moderate to low fat test tends to reduce the chance of digestive upsets . The rate of milk feeding should be about 10 per cent of the calf 's weight per day , up to a maximum of ten to twelve pounds per day . This should be divided into at least two feed-ings a day . If there is any question of digestive upsets , under-feeding is more desirable than overfeeding . If scouring occurs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the calf recovers . Cleanliness and sanitation are absolutely essential for all utensils // used in feeding calves . It is usually recommended that milk be fed at a constant temperature each day , preferably at 95 ? to 100 ? F. However , under conditions of good sanitation and low incidence of disease , calves can tolerate considerable variation in feeding conditions . If skim milk is readily available , it may be gradually substituted for whole milk as the calf reaches two or three weeks of age . Because of its lower fat and energy content , it is usually recommended that about 25 per cent more be fed than when whole milk makes up the ration . Older calves may be fed all the skim milk they will consume if they are gradually accustomed to it . If milk supplies are plentiful , calves may be continued on it for up to six months of age or longer . However , they may be weaned to grain and hay any time after two and one-half to three months . Feeding from this period on may be handled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dry calf starter . Under this system calves may be raised successfully with amounts of whole milk varying from 175 to 400 pounds . The advantage of this system is in the substitution of cheaper nutrients in grain and hay for those in milk . Calves raised under this program may not be as smooth or grow quite as fast during the first few weeks . However , by 18 months of age there should be little difference . The calf should be fed colostrum and taught to drink as mentioned previously . A sample milk-feeding schedule is presented in Table 6.3 . This may be varied within the limits of total milk mentioned above . The thriftiness of the calf should be considered , with weaker calves receiving milk for a longer period than strong , well-grown ones . By the beginning of the second week , a dry calf starter and hay should be fed . Dry calf starter . The calf may be introduced to the starter by placing a small amount in its month following the feeding of milk . A small amount put into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regu106 Developing Dairy Calves and Heifers larly . Calf starter may be fed on a free choice basis up to a maximum of three and one-half to four pounds per day . Calves should be con suming this amount by about three months of age . If especially rapid growth is desired more grain may be fed . A great variety of calf starters are available commercially which pro-vide adequate nutrition . When excellent-quality hay and good manage ment are available , calves will perform satisfactorily on a simple grain mixture or the mixture fed the milking herd . If a simple mixture is used , calves should have access to sunlight or other adequate sources of vitamin D. Sample formulas for two types of calf starters are given in Table 6.4 . If a complex starter is used , it should be replaced by a simple mixture , or the herd ration , at about four months of age . Because young calves chew their grain well , whole corn or oats may be included in the ration for the first four to six months . Other harder grains should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animals . Hay . The best-quality hay available should be used for young calves . Leafy , fine-stemmed legume hay is most desirable . However , good-quality mixed hay or early-cut grass hay may be used satisfactorily . Fresh hay should be provided daily starting at two weeks of age . The calf may be allowed all the hay it will consume , unless it is in short supply or overly expensive . Variations on the limited whole milk-dry calf starter method . Milk replacers have been developed which may be used to replace all but 50 to 60 pounds of whole milk in the calf-feeding program . The most successful of these are based on milk or milk by-products . Milk replacers are usually designed to be mixed with water and fed in a manner similar to milk . Although calves may not be quite as thrifty in early life with this method , satisfactory results may be obtained when a good quality milk replacer is fed according to directions supplied with the product . // Calves should be handled as indicated on the limited milk-dry calf starter method , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the milk . While the saving in milk may be important , the cost for labor and management will be greater than in a program utilizing whole milk . Calf-raising programs which call for emphasis on grain with limited hay intake , and those which rely heavily on hay with only a small amount of grain , have both been successful when properly managed . The first system emphasizes the use of high-energy feeds , and allows rapid growth during the early weeks . The latter method depends upon the rapid development of rumen function and the ability to utilize roughage early . The decision as to which method to use should be based upon the availability and cost of grain and high-quality hay , and the degree of management available for the calf herd . Antibiotics for calves . An increased growth rate has been shown when young calves are fed certain antibiotics . They also reduce the incidence of scours . Advantages in growth rate are limited to the early weeks , and heifers not fed antibiotics catch up quickly . Unless management conditions are better than average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will probably pay off in reducing disease and mortality . The usual rate is about 15 to 20 mg. per 100 pounds live weight per day . Antibiotics are of most benefit to the younger calves and may be added to the milk fed to them . Milk replacers and calf starters may also be used as vehicles for antibiotics . including antibiotics in the feed should not be used as a substitute for good management and sanitation . Cud inoculations for calves . When the feeding program includes high amounts of forage , it has been suggested by some research workers that cud material be taken from a ruminating cow and fed to the young calf . This is to establish the microflora more rapidly in the rumen . Calves in extreme isolation apparently benefit from this , but research has indicated that under most farm conditions normal rumen bacteria become established quickly without inoculation . Silage for calves . Good-quality silage may be substituted for all or part of the hay in the calf ration under certain conditions . Calves will usually not eat as much dry matter in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . More grain should be fed when silage makes up the only forage . Silage may be fed as part of the forage , with hay fed free-choice in addition . Recommended Feeding Practices Following Weaning I f the calf is weanc ( ( l at six to eight weeks , it should be eating at least tuuo pounds of starter per clay as well as appreciable amounts of hay at // that time . Hay should be continued free-choice . Starter should be fed free-choice until the calf is eating three and one-half to four pounds per day . At the age of four months , a simple grain mixture or the herd ration may replace the calf starter , if a complex mixture or commercial feed has been used . Recommended levels for concentrate feeding can be derived from Table 6.2 , based upon the size of the calf and the quality and amount of forage consumed . Feeding higher levels of concentrate may be practiced if faster growth is desired . Throughout the growing period , forage should be supplied freechoice . As the heifer approaches calving , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support pregnancy . High production will generally be achieved with less feed if cattle are well-grown and in good flesh at calving time . Samples of rations which will provide adequate nutrition for growing heifers are included in Table 6.5 . Pasture for growing heifers . Calves six to eight months of age will obtain many nutrients from pasture but should be supplied additional hay and grain . At about the age of one year , heifers can live entirely on good-quality pasture with supplemental salt and an ample supply of water . Care should be taken that there is adequate forage available . If pastures dry up or are in short supply , supplementary forage or grain should be fed . Growth standards for heifers . Table 6.2 contains average growth rates and weights at specific ages for dairy heifers . In some herds , feeding for faster growth and early breeding may be desirable and provide an economic advantage . Care should be taken to prevent heifers from becoming overly fat , which frequently is accompanied by excessive fat deposition in the udder . This interferes with normal development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good management of growing heifers includes frequent checking of growth progress and adjusting feed accordingly . If facilities for weighing are not available , weight can be estimated by measuring the heart girth with a tape especially designed for this purpose . MAINTAINING HEALTHY CALVES AND HEIFERS The principles of a good health program discussed in Chapter 10 apply to young animals . A few diseases and disorders of particular importance to calves are discussed here . Calf Scours Difficulty involving the digestive tract of calves , resulting in diarrhea , or scours , is probably the most serious problem in calf raising . The cause // of most calf scours is unknown , but because of the characteristics of many outbreaks , and measures which are helpful in control , it appears to be infectious in nature . It is likely that viruses are involved . The feeding program may have a contributory or causative effect in some cases . Coccidiosis and other parasitic infections also result in scours . The death of calves or prolonged periods of unthriftiness and poor growth result . Some animals never do reach normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differentiated according to their severity and the characteristics of the diarrhea involved . Whether these differences represent actual differences in infections is not known . " White scours , " for example , is the term given to a diarrhea which is loose , light-colored , and with a foul odor . This usually occurs in the first few days of life . Severe scouring may occur without discoloration of the feces . The progress of scours in very young calves may be rapid , with death occurring a few hours after symptoms are first observed or within two or three days . Mortality can be high in serious infections . In addition to diarrhea , affected calves exhibit depression , lack of appetite and evidence of dehydration . The treatment for scours is the use of sulfa drugs or antibiotics or combinations of them . Antibiotics of the tetracycline spectrum have proved most effective . Feeding should be limited . Colostrum from the dam or another fresh cow is essential to provide the newborn calf with antibodies against agents causing scours . Because of changes in the digestive tract of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairly rapidly . Colostrum is most effective during the first 24 hours of the life of the calf . It is relatively ineffective after 48 hours . Maintaining strict sanitation in the area where the cow calves and where young calves are housed is of extreme importance . Adequate feed intake without overfeeding is important . Sudden marked changes in the quantity and quality of feed should be avoided where scours is a problem . While not a substitute for good management , the routine feeding of antibiotics in the milk , milk replacer , or calf starter is helpful . These may be supplied at the rate of 20 milligrams per 100 pounds of body weight . At times very acute infections of calf scours are present in a herd . Death occurs early in life and no treatment is effective . In this situation it may be necessary to isolate newborn calves as quickly as possible after birth in quarters as nearly sterile as possible . Colostrum should be provided , but , to avoid picking up the infection from the dam , the calf should not be allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should he thoroughly sanitized before each cow is brought in . Most calves can be saved if thorough sanitary precautions and effective isoDeveloping // lation are practiced , and the calf is fed carefully , with antibiotics in the feed . In some instances , blood transfusions from mature animals have been utilized to give the calf immune bodies quickly as protection against severe scours . Respiratory Diseases of Calves Like most other animals , calves are susceptible to respiratory infections which may have the appearance of the common cold or the more serious conditions of pneumonia . Pneumonia often accompanies , or appears as a complication of , scours . It can be rapidly fatal . Again , the causative agents are not known ; however , research is indicating that cattle are probably affected by a number of viruses which result in cold symptoms . The way these infections are acquired is not well understood . Stress on an animal may be involved , making it susceptible to the action of infectious agents which are continuously present . Some evidence exists to indicate that waves of infection pass through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or other outside contacts . Prevention includes , as usual , the practice of good sanitation and the elimination of contact or traffic between herds or groups of cattle . Good ventilation is extremely important . Confinement of calves in humid quarters , barns , or pens subject to sudden changes of temperature or drafts should be avoided . All of these appear to place stress on calves , making them more subject to respiratory illnesses . Housing of the type shown in Figures 11.3 and 11.6 , pages 190 and 194 , is recommended . GENERAL MANAGEMENT OF CALVES Identification All calves should be permanently identified as soon as possible after birth . An ear tag system is most satisfactory . Without permanent identification , the parentage and other information on calves is frequently lost . Obviously , in addition to marking the calf , adequate records must be kept . Tattooing identifying numbers on the ear of lighter or solidcolored calves , and making color sketches of animals of mixed color , arc the most satisfactory methods of identifying cows for record-keeping . Where purebred cattle are involved the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Application for registry should be made Immediately . // Dehorning Dehorning should be practiced on all calves . Horns on cattle are a source of injury to animals in the herd and people working with them . In years past , horns have had interest in the show ring , but this is no longer the case . Dehorning may be accomplished by burning with an iron designed for the purpose , or by removing surgically with special tools or by destruction with a strong caustic . Each of the methods should be applied when the calf is only a few weeks old . Specific procedures should be followed according to the directions for the equipment used or as prescribed by a veterinarian . Removal of Extra Teats Teats on the udders of heifers in excess of four are usually best removed . Frequently , limited amounts of milk may be secreted by extra teats , creating difficulty at milking time . It is important in removing supernumerary teats to be positive that it is an extra one being removed and not one of the four which would normally become functional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by an experienced herdsman who makes sure proper sanitary procedures are followed and that the correct amount of tissue is removed . An opportune time to remove extra teats is when the calves are being vaccinated for brucellosis . COST OF RAISING HEIFERS In a majority of cases the total cost of raising replacement heifers is remarkably close to the market value of an animal ready to calve for the first time . Because of wide variation in prices in different areas and fluctuations from year to year , it is not possible to give specific figures for the cost of raising replacement heifers . The following is a list of the items which should be carefully evaluated in a calf-raising program . 1 . Value of calf at birth . 2 . Value of feed consumed , including milk , milk replacer , calf starter , growing ration or herd mix , hay , pasture , and silage . 3 . Labor . 4 . Bedding . 5 . Veterinary services and medication . 6 . Depreciation and taxes on buildings and equipment . 7 . Taxes on the animal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in feed , labor , and so forth . // Return from the heifer during the growing period is limited to the value of the manure she produces . There is a growing interest in raising calves commercially . In some large herds maintained for intensive milk production , there is frequently little attention given to raising replacements . Calves may be purchased from these herds at birth and sold when they are ready to start milking . RAISING CALVES FOR VEAL Bull calves and females not designated to be raised for replacements are sold for meat . These may be sold when one or a few days old or fed intensively to the age of approximately six weeks and then sold . The traditional method of raising veal has been to allow the calf to nurse all the milk it would consume until it reaches a weight of about 200 pounds or more . No other feed is supplied . This produces a carcass which is very white and has had greatest market value . In areas where milk prices are low , or where cows are available for nursing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ venture . When a ready market is available , milk usually provides a greater return than veal . Recently , milk replacers have been developed which make possible rapid growth of young calves . These are usually based on dried milk products and a stabilized fat . Many people have successfully raised veal on milk replacers on an experimental basis , and success has been achieved in some commercial operations . The labor and management efforts involved frequently make this system rather impractical when only a few calves are raised in conjunction with a milking operation . Some operators have attempted to develop a veal business by buying bull calves from various sources and feeding them out in a central location . Disease is the major difficulty in this enterprise . When numbers of calves are assembled from several sources , scours and other diseases frequently reach epidemic proportion quickly , with a high percentage of mortality . Antibiotics , sulfa drugs , and careful sanitation can do much to counter the disease problem . A few carefully managed units are making a success of feeding large numbers of veal calves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With increased knowledge of the specific problems involved , veal raising on a commercial basis may become a profitable adjunct to the business of dairying . In some areas , markets which accept calves partially fed on grain and a milk replacer may he developed . A few calves have already found this type of market on an experimental basis . // A satisfactory dairy enterprise must pay all costs of production and provide for an adequate profit or management income to the operator . Highly efficient operation is necessary if this objective is to be achieved . Costs of feed , labor , depreciation , bedding , and interest on investment are major areas of expense in a milk-producing business . Insurance , taxes , veterinary fees , and a number of other expenses must also be provided for . Accurate records of the cost of all items , and of the amount and value of production are necessary if sound management decisions are to be made . Since each cow is in reality an individual production unit , detailed records on its production and consumption are necessary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depends to a large extent upon their demonstrated ability for milk production . Therefore , it is important that milk production be recorded in a manner which leaves the record free of any possible bias due to personal interest . A number of production record systems have been developed . Both the breed registry organizations and the federal and state research and extension services sponsor programs . Close co-operation between these two groups exists in several states . All of these programs have been approved by the American Dairy Science Association . NATIONAL COOPERATIVE DAIRY HERD IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM The Dairy Husbandry Research Branch , Agricultural Research Service of the United States Department of Agriculture , working in co-operation with the dairy portion of the extension program in each state , makes available to dairymen a series of programs in production testing . Some of the details of each are presented below . Complete information is available f rtno the College of Agriculture at your state university . Inquiries should be directed to the Supervisor of ' Production Testing , care of the Dairy i ) epartment , if ' you wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dairy Herd Improvement Association ( DHIA ) The Dairy Herd Improvement Association ( DHIA ) system is the most used system of dairy record-keeping . This program works as follows . A supervisor or tester employed by the local testing association visits the herd one day each month . He identifies all cows in the herd ; weighs and takes representative samples of the milk from all animals in the herd for two consecutive milkings ( from three milkings for herds on 3x milking ) . He then combines the milk samples and tests them for butterfat . ( In many associations , this testing is done in central laboratories . ) Records are also obtained on the amount of grain fed each cow , and roughage consumption is calculated on a herd basis . Additional information on breeding dates , calving dates , dry dates , and other factors affecting the cow 's productivity is recorded . Cost or value data are obtained on feed used and milk or other products sold . Calculations are made , and information recorded , on production for individual cows and for the entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calculated and reported . A considerable amount of other information is also recorded by the tester in a permanent herd book for use by the dairyman . As each cow completes a lactation , summary information is recorded . At the end of the testing year , a herd average and summary are calculated . The supervisor submits his reports to the county agricultural agent and the state supervisor of testing , who are responsible for approving them . When properly used , this system of record-keeping provides the herd manager with rather complete information on his herd . In addition , reports submitted by the supervisor to the state and federal agencies co-operating in the program supply a reliable source of research material on the dairy industry . It is from these reports that bull proofs are developed .

In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mails them to a processing center . Here the data are submitted to the machines for calculation and summarization . The dairyman then receives a permanent record sheet each month from the computing center . A sample copy of this sheet is shown in Figure 7.1 . A few programs provide somewhat different information , but the one presented is used in most states . Present trends indicate that electronic data-processing machines will be used for most of the DI II A records in the near future . Records for Dairy Cattle 119 The following material is in explanation of the information available to a herd manager from records of the type shown in Figure 7.1 . Monthly Herd Summary . The first line of figures running across the page carries information based on the daily average per cow , in other words , the average cow 's performance on the day of the month on which the herd was tested . These data give a month-to-month comparison on the performance of the herd . One of the few concepts of the central processing system is the computation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major feed sources . The amount of net energy is based upon the nutrient content of the various feeds , according to the amounts and quality reported by the supervisor on the barn sheet . The rate of roughage feeding is computed from the amount fed , compared to the average body weight , and is quoted in terms of " hay equivalent " fed per hundred pounds of body weight . A set of factors is used to convert pounds of silage , inferior quality hay , or pasture hays to their equivalent weight in good hay . The third line down is a " 12-month herd average " which will be shown each month . It will include all data since the herd was started on central processing . Thus , on first month 's sheet it is an " annual average " based on only one month 's data . Next month , the first 2 months ' information will be Averaged , and so on , until at the end of 12 months a legitimate yearly figure will be available . After that , this computation will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolling herd average " will be established . The comparison of this rolling herd average to individual cows ' records at any time will provide a useful means of evaluating a cow 's production record , because each cow can then be compared with her stable-mates over a similar length of time . The " feeding index " is a percentage computation , obtained by dividing the amount of net energy received by the amount of net energy needed . All feeds reported fed are included in the amount received . The amount needed includes adequate allowances for body maintenance of all cows in the herd plus the amount required for milk production at the average herd level . A feeding index of 100 indicates a balance between energy needed and energy provided . Several factors could cause this index to be either higher or lower . If it is above 100 it is possible that the amount or quality of the various feeds , especially forages , were estimated too high , that the herd may be gaining in average body weight , or that the test clay performance may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually eaten by the herd should be entered , not the amount fed , which includes a considerable amount of waste . A low feeding index would indicate the opposite of the above conditions . Since most cows enter the herd as 2-year-olds and leave as mature cows , energy for growth must be provided . In most herds , a feeding index within a range of 110-115 would indicate that sufficient additional energy was being provided to cover growth requirements . Individual cow information . On each cow 's line , under " test day data , " the number of pounds of concentrates fed is recorded . In addition , there is a figure " pounds indicated . " This is the amount required by each cow to provide energy for body maintenance and milk production . It takes into account the rroportionate amount of forage each cow may have eaten in relation to her ody weight as well as the amount received through concentrates . Its precision will depend largely upon how well the dairyman and the supervisor estimate the amount and quality of forages . The " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how much to feed , but it can be a useful guide . The amount of concentrates fed must take into account body condition , stage of lactation and other factors known only to the dairyman . In addition to the test day data and the current month 's production information on each cow , each cow 's lactation-to-date information is carried each // month . Each cow 's information will always be completely up to date in all details . Explanatory notes appear at the bottom of the sheet . When an asterisk ( * ) appears in the days-carried-calf column , it shows that a cow has carried a calf more than 220 days and should be turned dry in order to have a 60-day dry period before calving again . When an asterisk appears in the days-in-milk column , it shows that the cow has been fresh more than 60 days and no breeding date has yet been reported , so either the cow should be bred in order to obtain a normal calving interval of 12 to 13 months , or you should provide the supervisor with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information included in the report ( Figure 7.1 ) . 1 .

Owner Sampler Records ( OS ) This system of record keeping varies from the D.H.I.A. program in that the owner weighs and samples the milk himself and records all other pertinent data . The same summaries and calculations are made for the owner as with the D.H.I.A. program . Owner sampler records may be processed on electronic machines . Records obtained in this manner are for the use of the herd owner or manager .

BREED PROGRAMS The registry associations all sponsor testing programs as an aid to improving the quality of their cattle and as a method of publicizing the breed . Details of these programs are published in a booklet entitled : " Unified Rules for Official Testing " available from each breed association or from the State Supervisor of Production Testing . Herd Improvement Registry All of the major breeds have a program of production testing of this kind . Testing is conducted by a supervisor or tester employed by the State Superintendent of Production Testing . The supervisor visits the farm involved for two consecutive milkings ( three milkings for herds on 3x milking ) , identifies all cows in the herd , weighs the milk from each cow , and takes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for determination of the fat content of each cow 's production . The supervisor records milk weight and fat tests on forms provided by the breed association and mails them to the association for processing . All registered cows , with few exceptions , must be included in the program , which is conducted on a yearly basis . Monthly and summary information is returned to the owner from each test . Herd averages and production records of individual cows are certified and published by the breed associations . Production records are used in sire evaluation and in recognition programs of the associations involving outstanding animals and breeders . Advanced Registry ( A.R. ) ' I'liis system is known by varying names in different breeds . It is not. , Irenvidcd by the Ayrshire Association . It is designed to provide produc124 Records for Dairy Cattle tion information on one or more individual registered cows in a herd . The State Superintendent of Official Testing is responsible for the supervisors or testers who visit farms in this program . A test period of 24 to 48 hours with a preliminary dry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be kept and sent to the breed association monthly . Records are used in much the same manner as indicated for H.I.R. testing . The A.R . program is the least used of those mentioned , and participation in it is declining . Dairy Herd Improvement Registry ( D.H.I.R. ) This most recent of recording programs is conducted co-operatively by the breed associations and the Cooperative Dairy Herd Improvement Program . In this system , records recognized as official by both groups may be obtained in one program . The general provisions are as follows . The herd must be already enrolled in regular D.H.I.A. , with the records processed by electronic equipment . The owner makes application to the breed association for inclusion in the D.H.I.R. Program . Summaries of records processed at the D.H.I.A. computing center are supplied the registry association , which utilizes them in the same way as they do records from the regular breed programs . Cost of Record-Keeping The cost of providing the records discussed above is borne by the herd owner . There is some variation in charges , depending on the amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information provided by any of them is worth much more than the cost involved . Personal Records The foregoing discussion has concerned record-keeping systems sponsored by various agencies or organizations . Personal record systems may be developed which are quite satisfactory . Several groups interested in dairying have forms available for such records . Choosing a Record System The decision of the individual dairyman as to what record system to adopt should be based upon the use he intends to make of the records . No dairyman can afford to be without records of the amount and cost of items going into production . These are provided by the D.II.I.A. and // the Owner-Sampler programs . A dairyman selling cattle for production purposes can benefit by having official records provided by the breed programs or D.H.I.A. Anyone deeply interested in purebred cattle will find that official breed records provided by H.I.R. , A.R. , or D.H.I.R. increase the market value of his cattle and make it possible for him to enjoy the benefits of the breed-recognition programs . The D.H.I.R. program answers all of the above criteria and appears to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " TYPE " in dairy cattle is usually understood to mean the appearance and body conformation of an individual as compared to a standard of excellence . Since the earliest domestication of cattle , men have striven to develop animals which excelled in appearance and conformation . Developing individuals and families which closely resemble the ideal established for the species or breed has been a source of satisfaction and pride to animal husbandmen wherever they have existed . Today , in addition to adherence to a specific standard , desirable type is understood by most dairymen to refer to the kind of cow which is adapted to the pattern of modern herd management . Emphasis is placed on profitableness and meeting the reasonable needs of dairy farmers . ESTABLISHMENT OF TYPE STANDARDS A quotation is given in Chapter 1 of a type standard for dairy cattle in ancient Rome . Ideals of type have existed , in many forms and variations , in local areas since the beginning of animal husbandry . The standards for type in dairy cattle presently in use originated with the founding of purebred organizations in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started in this country in 1929 . Type standards for dairy cattle are dynamic and subject to change . As new ideas or information develop , they are incorporated into the standards . Current Type Standards for Dairy Cattle Each of the major dairy-breed associations has an active committee on dairy-cattle type . These meet regularly and review and modify the type characteristics considered ideal for the breed . The standard established by this committee then becomes a " trademark " for the breed . Figures 8.1 , 8.2 , 8.3 , 8.4 , and 8.5 depict the " true type " cows of the five major dairy breeds . Type standards for the major breeds are remarkably similar , with // // differences in size , color characteristics , and a few other points serving as identification of each of the breeds . The Purebred Dairy Cattle Association , an organization with membership representing each of the five major dairy breeds , has developed a Unified Score Card and detailed type standards common to all breeds . A copy of these standards and the numerical evaluation given to the various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Figure 8.7 presents the terms used to identify the parts of the cow in discussing type . A brief description of the characteristics of each breed , which is a part of this Unified Score Card , is included in Chapter 12 . Market value of type . A definite monetary value is placed on good type in dairy cattle by most dairymen , particularly by breeders of purebred cattle . Animals which have been evaluated and found to excel in type in breed-classification programs , or which have placed high in showring competition , particularly in the more important shows , frequently command considerably more money than those of unestablished or mediocre type . Body conformation is a factor in determining the value of animals in a majority of private sales . //
