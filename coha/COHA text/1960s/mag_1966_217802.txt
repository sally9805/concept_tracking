It was the first general election since the army toppled President Joao Goulart almost three years ago , and Brazilians took their voting seriously . There were the usual murders in various election brawls . In some remote western areas , voters traveled 19 days in order to reach the nearest ballot box . As the votes came in last week , they pointed toward a resounding sweep for the government 's ARENA Party . <P> At stake were 23 seats in the 66-member federal Senate , all 409 seats in the Chamber of Deputies , plus all 22 state legislatures , local councils and municipal mayorships . Under Brazil 's new government-decreed two-party system , voters could either cast their ballot for the government 's ARENA candidate or for the opposition M.D.B.-thus theoretically voting for or against President Humberto Castello Branco 's brand of " revolution . " Such is Brazilian politics today that a vote for a government candidate was not always a vote for the government . Some ARENA candidates openly proclaimed-their opposition to Castello Branco . In Sao Paulo , one ARENA campaigner pleaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's policies from within . " The opposition , far freer with its criticism , loudly blasted the diminutive ex-general for his " dictatorship . " <P> With more than half of the votes counted by week 's end , ARENA appeared to have won 260 or more seats in the Chamber of Deputies and 17 or 18 seats in the Senate ; it was also leading in 19 out of the 22 state legislatures , as well as in most of the municipal councils and mayoralties.
