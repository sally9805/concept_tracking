( See Cover ) <P> According to Texas lore , the reason Dallas has one of the nation 's busiest airports is that outbound jets are loaded with Texas businessmen heading for Wall Street to borrow money . The two most notable jet passengers from Dallas to New York last week-flying on separate planes to increase the odds that at least one of them would survive the trip-were bound on a different mission . John Dabney Murchison , 39 , and his brother Clinton Williams Murchison Jr. , 37 , flew to Manhattan not as suppliants but as conquerors . In a coup that outdealt even the feats of their wheeler-dealer father , oil-rich Clint Murchison Sr. ( TIME cover , May 24 , 1954 ) , the Murchison brothers of Texas had won , almost in spite of themselves , a commanding position in the very citadel of U.S. finance . <P> They did it by taking control of Alleghany Corp. , the vast Manhattan holding company whose direct assets ( $122 million ) by no means reflect the power it exercises over the U.S. economy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and substantial chunks of the Baltimore &; Ohio and Missouri Pacific railroads , Alleghany controls Minneapolis ' Investors Diversified Services , a $3.4 billion investment giant that includes the world 's largest mutual fund . In the biggest and bitterest proxy fight in U.S. history , the Murchisons snatched Alleghany out of the hands of Woolworth Heir Allan P. Kirby , 68 , a Wall Street titan with a fortune far bigger than theirs . More impressive yet , they won by rallying more Wall Street support than Kirby himself . " All of us here in Texas were pulling for them , " says Dallas Insurance Millionaire Jimmy Collins . " We like big deals in Texas , and this is the biggest kind you can make . We admire it because the Murchisons won it the hard way-on the home grounds of the other guy . " <P> The Bird Dogs . The Murchisons ' victory on Allan Kirby 's home grounds was dramatic notice of the changing role of Texas in the U.S. economy . Easterners still like to think of Texans as illiterate oil millionaires who wear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for money , some Texans shrewdly play the expected part . Says Dallas Millionaire Trammell Crow : " I know I can get in to see people in New York more easily because it says I 'm from Texas on my business card . They want to see what a Texan looks like . " But at home in Dallas or Houston , today 's Texas tycoon is more apt to wear a Brooks Brothers suit than Texas boots ; though his poke may have started in oil ( and gained by the 27% depletion allowance ) , much of it now comes from electronics , real estate , insurance or shipping . And for the new Texan , Texas is no longer big enough . Ranging across the nation like eager bird dogs , Texas businessmen are supplying capital , entrepreneurial vigor and acumen in nearly every area of the U.S. economy .
