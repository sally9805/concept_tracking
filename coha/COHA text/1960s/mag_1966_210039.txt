FASHION Pieced in Plastic <P> The effect was breathtaking . Out strode the model , clothed in nothing but wafer-thin plastic disks , each glinting with dazzling sun colors ( hot orange , pink ) and hung together with fine wires . <P> Next came a coat of mail in glistening silver that let a generous amount of skin go unprotected . Then came sun visors shaped like welders ' helmets and oversized plastic earrings that dangled weightlessly at shoulder level . <P> It was the U.S. debut at Manhattan 's Lord &; Taylor of Jewelry Designer Paco Rabanne , at 32 the hit of Paris and overnight a whole industry in himself . Only last February , Paco presented a small experimental collection of disk dresses in his fifth-floor , walk-up Paris studio , and suddenly the rush was on . <P> Britain 's Queen plunged with 14 pages , Harper 's Bazaar put his work on last month 's cover , and Vogue 's current issue leads off with Top Model Donyale Luna ( TIME , April 1 ) in one of Paco 's shifts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prefer to wear a body stocking underneath ) . <P> Sexy Mermaids . Bound to be seen everywhere this summer , if Paco 's hand-crafters can keep up with demand and charge accounts can take the gaff ( dresses begin at $300 , simple earrings $4 ) , Rabanne 's disks were an instant hit with the models . " It makes such a nice clatter when you move , " said one . " I feel like a sexy mermaid . " What happens if you sit down ? " You should n't ; they 're for dancing , " was Paco 's prompt retort . One model tried anyway , reported : " Not bad . It sort of slips away . " <P> Paco himself sort of slipped into haute couture . As the son of Balenciaga 's premiere ( first seamstress ) in San Sebastin , Spain , he grew up in the world of fashion . He set out to be an architect , studied at the Atelier Perret , then drifted into fashion design . " Fashion is the same process as architecture , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limits-in fashion , those of a woman 's body . " One reminder of his former studies is his white-pailletted hat , " directly inspired by Bucky Fuller 's geodesic dome . " <P> Clean-Cut &; Brilliant . He began hitting his stride with plastic accessories . Then from sun goggles and huge choker necklaces the jewelry grew into whole dresses , until currently he buys 30,000 meter-square sheets of Rhodoid plastic a month . But production is still painstakingly slow : ten days for a short shift , 15 days for a long dress . <P> Paco is pleased but not surprised by his sudden success : " There was a need for a new concept of feminity , " he explains . " Feathers and boas have no meaning for today 's woman . She needs something clean-cut and brilliant . " The ideal ? " A shining rubber paint that would dry into a second skin . "
