Dr. William Brady , a spry , 84-year old resident of Beverly Hills , takes great pride in his health . Brady is deaf in one ear , and a few months ago he had to give up daily somersaulting after cracking a vertebra in a dizzy spell following a spin . But his eyes are bright , 16 of his teeth are his own , and his arteries are no harder than those of a man of 45 . All told , Brady makes a lively exhibit for the efficacy of his own advice , which he has dispensed daily through his syndicated column " Personal Health Service , " for the past 50 years . <P> Brady 's 5,000,000 outpatients- a figure reflecting the combined circulation of his 80 papers-get a solid dose of oldfangled , no-nonsense medical advice . He is against TV patent-medicine commercials , toothpaste ( he uses soap and a birch toothpick ) , cigarettes , alcohol and hypochondria . " What is my blood pressure advice ? " he once asked his readers , and capitalized his answer " NEVER MIND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefits of exercise , he scolded sloths : " Do n't just sit on your ischial tuberosities , watching hired professionals play " <P> Down to the Tegument . " Temperance , correct breathing , nudity and conservation of the teeth " stand high on his list of good health habits . Brady himself often peels down to the tegument- in some sequestered corner , to be sure . <P> " A certain amount of nakedness is good for the body , " he says , " for it gives all the cells a chance to breathe freely . " <P> If his homespun counsel smacks of medicine 's horse-and &buggy; days , this is only because Brady himself is a product of that departed time . After graduating from the University of Buffalo medical school in 1901 , he set up a practice and in 1914 began writing a column for the Elmira N.Y . Star Gazette . So far as Brady knows he was then the only M.D in newspaper practice . <P> Today some 30 physicians syndicate medical columns , touching on just about every medical specialty but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York Time 's Dr. Howark A Rusk a practicing authority on rehabilitation of the handicapped , confined their practice to the home-town paper . Readers response can be impressive . Dr. Joseph G Molner , who writes for 383 U.S and Canadian papers , gets up to 100,000 letters a month . After Montreal French-language La Presse , which carries Dr. Brady in translation , dropped him tor a week , the managing editor " heard from almost every old-age pensioner in the Dominion . " <P> No End of Somersaults . The American Medical Association takes a tolerant position on newspaper medical practice perhaps because Morris Fishbein , longtime editor of the A.M.A Journal ( 1924-49 ) , wrote a column himself for 27 years . Fishbein 's column , as a matter of fact , survived his newspaper career ; after he left it , the syndicate kept it going with three other physicians <P> Brady 's syndicate , the National Newspaper Syndicate of Chicago , is not at all concerned about finding a successor for him . Tucked away in N.N.S. files is half a century 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach to medicine , are not likely to go out of style . By tapping this reservoir , N.N.S. can keep Dr. Brady somersaulting in print for countless years after his death-and intends doing so .
