txt Ulysses Doss knows Chicago 's West Side Negroes at the hot and grimy street level , and he says Negroes have grown more militant since last summer 's riot . The view of this young , articulate , well-dressed Negro is blunt , but typical . It suggests an apparent basic change among Negro attitudes in many big cities toward the feeling that only extreme measures will now bring about social justice . Thus , rioting or talk of rioting , or the possibility of rioting has become common in the Negro community . For many West Side Negroes this reporter has talked with recently , rioting has become a logical and normal Step- in the continuing American Negro movement . But this surge , in Negro militancy sometimes takes shape in less violent , yet for the Negro , extreme , forms of protest . New thread woven There is a growing interest among Negroes in running for public offices . They run for these traditionally Democratic-held posts as independent Democrats or liberal Republicans and are meeting with increasing local success . West Side Negroes display @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater voice in city planning in efforts to preserve and fix up rather than bulldoze their slums . In short , a new thread is being woven into the fiber of the community . It can be called black nationalism or black pride or just plain awareness . But it all forms a patterned quilt of Negro militancy at varying levels . Behind much of this intense protest is the Negro feeling that things have gotten worse since last year . One young Negro explains it this way : " In the house it 's hot so I come downstairs and two police run me off and I sit in the tavern and he runs me out of there . We gon na riot . And we 'll think of the dirt we get from police and that tavern . " Police little respected Police still are viewed with little respect by many , despite police-community relations work . The city has made numerous attempts during the winter to provide new playgrounds , recreation , jobs  --  and has announced summer programs  --  but the feeling persists that almost nothing has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haves and have-riots , " says Chester Robinson , who heads the three-year-old West Side Organization for Full Employment . " People sit up and watch those new cars and new clothes on TV all day and . . . " There seems to exist a preoccupation with the thought of rioting among many . " In five years we 've seen it go from sit-ins in Chicago to a few rocks to the first Molotov cocktail to gunfire , " observes one Negro . Approval by many Most Negroes , of course , will not participate in or start or inflame a riot . But such action has long received tacit approval from many of these Negroes , including the middle class . And now others even justify it as a normal part of the Negro movement . Here is how the Rev. Mr. Doss explains the usefulness of a riot . ( He is a minister , though in summer he wears civilian clothes so as to mingle more closely with youths . ) " Does a riot serve a purpose ? I 'd say no if the values @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the values are different . " Nothing belongs to him or anyone else . // *Chicago Negroes militant as attitudes slowly shift // All is up for grabs , for free . He has nothing to lose . " Now , in any revolution , innocent people are killed and property destroyed . The white community sees this as a terrible loss . But to the people fighting for freedom there is no such thing as the sacredness of property or lives . " That property or lives is not the important thing . The important thing is that the people want to be free . This freedom is expensive whenever there is an oppression . " Unless you are part of this oppression you ca n't understand how a stone or fire can be thrown at life or property with no regard . " Militancy not rejected This reasoning helps explain the thinking behind the inflammatory speeches of civil-rights advocate Stokely Carmichael , or the leaders of such groups as the Deacons for Defense and Justice and Associated Community Teams ( ACT ) . " I 'm not too sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong , " says the Rev. Mr. Doss . " Conditions are so horrible here than once a person comes in and says , ' Why live here ? Protest ' the people rise up . " It 's not the person speaking but the con " There was one point last winter during which we would have had a riot if it had not been 10 degrees below zero , " recalls Walter Herrs , the white director of the West Side Federation of 30 mostly Negro organizations and churches . " A man was apprehended for drinking and he pulled a knife and was shot by a policeman . A hundred and fifty or so people standing around were harangued by black-nationalist types . " The potential for violence on Chicago 's West Side today appears close to the surface .
