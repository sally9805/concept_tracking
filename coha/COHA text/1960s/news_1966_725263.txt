txt Automobiles whipped along Fifth and Madison Avenues yesterday faster than anyone could remember . The swift traffic flow was a result of the conversion of the avenues in the morning to oneway flow  --  Fifth Avenue going south and Madison going north . The police , the Traffic Department and nearly all taxi drivers were delighted , but some merchants and some pedestrians were not very happy , with the change . Fifth and Madison Avenues . had been the city 's last remaiMng major two-way avenues . They were scheduled for conversion in March but the timetable was speeded up to help oope with congestion and delays arising from the Transit strike . On Almost Every Corner Policemen were stationed at virtually every cross street on both avenues yesterday . There were only a few wrongway drivers , who , in the Nerds of an old story that Traffic Commissioner Henry A. Barnes recalled , were able to say : " I do n't know where I 'm going but I must be late because everybody else is coming back . " He said that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " worked beautifully . " Police Commissioner Vincent L. Broderick was even more enthusiastic . " I do n't think you can even call it an experiment . " It 's working so well it 's now part of our permanent traffic procedure , " he said . Set at 25 M.P.H. On both avenues the signal lights have been set for a driving speed of 25 miles ' an hour , which , in theory , means that a motorist who maintains that speed exactly should be able to drive the length of either avenue without stopping at a red light . But Walter Hoving , chairman of Tiffany &; Co. , said that the change had made Fifth Avenue " a superhighway from the Bronx to Brooklyn . It was the result of superficial thinking If Barnes knew anything about business or customers h ( would not have done it . " " From Barnes 's standpoint exclusively to move traffic , i might be working well , " he said " But for business it 's danger ous . Fifth Avenue could corn apart . " Mr. Hoving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived at his office in Tiffany 's and told him a harrowing tale of being whisked in a taxi uptown on Madison Avenue  --  a completely unfamiliar . thoroughfare to her  --  and she could n't get out to window-shop on Fifth and walk leisurely to our store . " ' It 's getting difficult to get here . " she complained , " according to Mr. Hoving . He said he thought the new traffic pattern would perhaps cause the greatest change on Fifth Avenue since Benson J. Lossing. the historian , with a companion , strolled up the avenue in 1845 , picking strawberries where B. Altman 8 , , Co. now stands , and reported seeing mink , otter and muskrat scurrying in the marshes and ponds along the way . Meanwhile , the city 's subways and buses were back on normal schedules on the second working day after the transit strike . Other traffic in the city also was as usual . Fifth Avenue was made southbound from 138th Street to Washington Square . Mr. Barnes and Mr. Broderick said that it took them 23 minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes on Thursday . Madison Avenue became northbound from 23rd Street to 135th Street . It took the two commissioners 38 minutes to make the trip on Thursday and 21 minutes yesterday , they said . Seated between them was an attractive , dark-haired younger woman . The two older women complained at having to take the bus downtown on Fifth rather than on Madison . " It 's miserable , " said one in a red hat . " It 's so windy ; by the park , and at night it 's very dangerous . " " It does n't bother me at all , " the young woman interjected. woman in the red hat protested . woman in the redhat protested . " Whoever had this idea. , he has done no traveling , " said the second elderly woman , in a black hat , " and does n't know what this city is all about . " avenue , I mean . It distracts me from window shopping , all these speeding cars . " At the Metropolitan Museum of Art , two elderly women who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat Commissioner Barnes directed the changeover from a hastily opened control center at 769 Fifth Avenue , in the partly demolished Savoy Plaza Hotel , between 58th and 59th Streets . He beamed as he peered through the window there or stood on street corners and watched the traffic roar by . He rode the length of Madison and Fifth Avenues three times during the day , and each time was more satisfied with the results . On several occasions , taxi drivers , spotting the commissioner on the sidewalk , pulled over and shook his hand . One said . " It 's the greatest thing that ever happened . It should have been done 40 years ago . " Another hailed it as a ' miracle . " Gone were the old Fifth Avenue travails : frustrated motorists locked behind a chain of buses , unable to pull nut for blocks , and stalled behind automobiles attempting to turn into cross streets . However , Commissioner , Broderick noted , several matters that needed correction ; for example . buses stopping too far from the curb . He said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Because motorists were confused , there were also more ' delays than usual on crosstown ' streets . And the Fifth Avenue Association , made up of about 1,000 business concerns , complained to the Police Department that trucks were using Fifth Avenue to speed downtown . Commercial vehicles have been banned for some time from the avenue . except those making deliveries to Fifth Avenue stores , but the Traffic Department has not yet put up signs telling them to stay off . " As soon as the signs are up there will be no more trouble with trucks . " Assistant Chief Inspector John King of the Police Safety Division said . On Fifth Avenue , people apparently had their own parochial view of the change . " Well . we wo n't have this bus stop here any more . It 'll make it easier for me to summon taxis , " William Wilkins , the doorman at 960 Fifth Avenue , at East 76th Street , said , with just a touch of Britain in his accent .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
