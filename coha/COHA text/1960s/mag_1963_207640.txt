" I ca n't get my tongue around other people 's words and phrases , " Lord Home once explained . It is just as well . The Prime Minister writes or ad libs his own speeches , and though they give cautious bureaucrats the shudders , Lord Home 's own sparkling words are full of candor , common sense , eloquence . <P> On National Aims : " When paleolithic man lived on lizards , he had two jobs : to provide security for his family and food for them to eat . Things have n't changed much . The basic objective of our foreign policy is to provide security and food with which to feed ourselves . " <P> On Negotiating with Russia : " I believe there may be just room to coexist if we reply to Russia 's Jekyll and Hyde performance with a certain duality of our own . We must expose and frustrate the conspirator and negotiate with the patriot . If Mr. Khrushchev is sending a genuine olive branch , then he will find I am perfectly capable of sitting on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <P> On " Softness " Toward Communism : " We do not always choose to express our opposition to Communism in the military context . That would be much too simple an answer , but we see the challenge clearly and the need to meet it all along the line . So do not be misled into thinking us soft . Some of our enemies made that mistake . Napoleon called us a nation of shopkeepers . The memorial to him in London is a railway station called Waterloo . Shopkeepers we may be , but neither our principles nor our alliances are for sale . " <P> On the Cold War : " We must not give ground anywhere . Does that mean that we should never be able to improve our chances of living together with Russia or engineering better relations ? I could not accept that pessimistic conclusion . The impact of education and science is inevitably working a social change in the Soviet Union . A revolution started 40 years ago can not maintain its momentum for ever . In spite of all setbacks , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balance of terror-because that is what life is . But we must work to wards keeping the peace by reason-because that is what life ought to be . " <P> On Communist Goals : " Their aim is to overthrow the way of life free men have chosen for themselves and substitute their own . Their tactics are to undermine , harry and probe weaknesses everywhere , backing up if necessary their probes with force . Today it is the Congo , Laos , Tibet and Cuba . Tomorrow it will be another selection . That is what Mr. Khrushchev calls peaceful coexistence . There is very little peaceful about it except that , with luck , the guns do n't fire . " <P> On the U.S. : " Those who can accuse the Americans of being warlike are those who either do not know them or who find the Americans ' championship of liberty astride their path of ambition . The only people who can accuse the Americans of being imperialists are those who are significantly deficient in humor . " <P> On Alliances : " Internationally , Britain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe , and the Atlantic Alliance . But a tripod is a particularly uncomfortable seat if one leg is shorter and weaker than the other , and so it must be the positive purpose of our foreign policy to strengthen all three .
