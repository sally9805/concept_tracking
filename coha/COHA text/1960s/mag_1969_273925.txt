WHO TOOK THE GOLD AWAY by John Leggett. 468 pages . Random House . $6.95 . <P> <P> There are two sides to the generation gap . Just as there are graybeards over 30 who do n't know where it 's at , there are peach fuzzes barely 20 who have n't the foggiest of where it used to be . Take the traditional college experience , for example . The fiercest barricades used to be social , not political-because the politics were personal , not ideological . It was more important to get in with the right people than get on with the struggle against an unjust world . The results , in those days , were relationships that were both sturdy and slightly sick . <P> Consider the case of Ben Moseley and Pierce Jay . Both are Yalemen , both class of ' 42 . Ben is a scholarship student from a public high school in Providence , Pierce a cosmopolitan product of the church school system . Ben is quiet , competent , dullish ; he studies and plods and runs the campus laundry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every way ; he downs his drinks with gusto , drives fast cars and is the spunky campus cutup . <P> As sharp opposites , Pierce and Ben naturally attract each other . They become roommates , try out together for the News , join the same club ( Fence ) . But like so many good friends they are also bad friends , out to destroy as much as to enhance each other . Ben secretly ruins Pierce 's chance to become chairman of the News . Pierce makes clandestine love to Ben 's virginal girl friend . <P> Domestic Explosion . All of this is literally the stuff of an old-school novel . Author Leggett ( class of ' 42 ) remembers prewar Yale , from a Tap Day at Branford Court to any day in the heelers ' room of the Oldest College Daily . He tells it with marvelous class and considerable spit and polish . He also manages to launch his dual heroes upon a Marquandish stream of life . <P> After separation in the war , the destructive bonds of friendship are renewed when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conies during a cruise off the rocky shores of Maine , when Ben-almost inevitably-beds down with Pierce 's wife . <P> The remarkable creation within this workmanlike and well-modulated narrative is the character of Pierce . Steadfastly carrying a belief in the heroic pattern of life " like a shiny coin in his pocket , " he represents a Hemingway-esque hero as seen through a Fitzgerald lens . His relationship with Ben is something far more complex than a simple boy-meets-boy story . As Pierce 's wife observes to Ben just before the denouement : " What a curious pair you are , you two . I used to think the relationships between women were complicated , but they 're nothing to what goes on between a couple of old Blues , are they ? "
