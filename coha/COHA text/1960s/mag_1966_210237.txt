There was a time when Kenyans solved their political problems with the panga , a two-foot-long bush knife that the Man Mau terrorists wielded to bloody effect against British rule . Independence and parliamentary government demand more subtle solutions . Kenya 's President Jomo Kenyatta , whom the British once jailed as the master of the Mau Mau , has been quick to adapt . <P> Take the problem of Oginga Odinga , the powerful leftist who last month resigned as Vice President , bolted the ruling Kenya African National Union , and took 27 other members of Parliament with him to form his own opposition party . Although Jomo still had a clear majority in the 130-member House , Odinga 's revolt was the first serious challenge to the political unity on which the Mzee ( Old Man ) has based his rule . Kenyatta 's answer was to cut Odinga down to size , and his slices were as quick , neat and deadly as those of a Mau Mau panga . <P> First he called Parliament into emergency session , rammed through a constitutional amendment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office again , this time against KANU 's powerful opposition instead of with its support . Then , before a mass rally in Nairobi last week , he produced four former Mau Mau leaders who told the shocked crowd that Odinga had offered them nearly $500,000 to return to the forests to fight Kenyatta . " If you play around with me , " warned the Mzee , " you 'll be playing around with a lion . " So saying , he reshuffled his Cabinet , putting pro-West moderates into all posts formerly held by Odinga 's left-wingers . His final stroke was to name Foreign Minister Joseph Murumbi as his new Vice President . Murumbi , a sometime leftist whose occasional anti-Western statements have angered Kenyatta in the past , is nevertheless absolutely loyal-and , unlike Odinga , has no pretensions to the presidency . From now on , Kenyatta himself will handle his nation 's foreign affairs .
