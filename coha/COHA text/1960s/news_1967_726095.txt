txt Letters to the Editor of The Times pg . 32 Letters to the Editor of The Times To Make Medicaid Work To the Editor : Your timely editorial " Medicaid Muddle " Jan. 28 accurately reported some of the problems which have bogged down the New York Medicaid Program . The Association of Health , Welfare and Pension Plan Administrators has been deeply involved for many months with state and city officials in an effort to eliminate many of the administrative road blocks . However , there are still many major issues which have not yet been resolved , such as : Replacement of the almost impossible application form with a simple , easily understood affi ? davit ; Participation of an adequate number of doctors , dentists , op. titian , pharmacists and other providers of health services ; A massive crash program to publicize and clarify Medicaid by making full use of the press , radio , television and other avail . able media ; Clear definition of the right of a Medicaid patient to utilize semiprivate hospital accommodations and thereby continue treatment by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patient " ; Integration of existing health insurance coverage such as Blue Shield and Group Health Insur. ante with Medicaid . Information Lacking The confusion , lack of information and misinformation which exist some nine months after the law was enacted must be laid at the door of state and local officials in the Health and Welfare Departments . Neither the applicants in urgent need o/ the promised health services nor those anxious to provide them can obtain necessary information or intelligent answers to their questions from the various officials responsible for the law 's administration . The enrollment of only a few thousand people out of a potential seven or eight million eligible is testimony to the program 's dismal failure . We believe that both the Governor and the Legislature have a duty to conduct an immediate investigation to determine the facts and take prompt action to get the program moving . Anything less will be considered a betrayal by the many citizens who are still being relegated to second-class medical care . WILLIAM J. TAYLOR Secretary Association of Health , Welfare and Pension Plan Administrators New York , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : James Reston , in his perceptive column of Jan. 22 on antimissile missiles , said that if President Johnson should tell the American people they can not defend themselves from allout nuclear attack , and should adduce the scientific evidence ? of which there is plenty ? " the Congress simply will not believe IL . " Here is the profound dilemma of the nuclear age : the facts are incontrovertible , but many if not most of us refuse to believe them . Mr. Reston has not taken a poll of Congress ? I know a number of Congressmen who do believe the evidence  --  but probably he has a safe majority . This is unfortunate if not indeed tragic . It is a function of what such psychologists as Dr. Jerome Frank call " denial , " the refusal to face unpleasant facts . If an individual has enough " denial " in his ' system , he is impervious to reason . On the chance , however , that some Congressmen are still wavering , here is what an all-out antimissile program logically portends : A. massive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious attempts to halt the proliferation of nuclear weapons ; An abandonment of most , if not all , beginnings toward coexistence  --  increased trade , consular offices , cultural exchange , direct air routes and so on . The end of the d ? tente ; An increase in the probability of World War III ; Increased probability of nuclear accidents , due to manfailure or machine-failure , which may ignite a nuclear exchange ; A $40-billion outlay , according to Reston , including a vast shelter program ; One final danger , according to Dr. Ralph E. Lapp , nuclear physicist and member of the first atomic bomb team : an enemy could go around an antimissile system the way the Germans went around the Maginot Line . Eight or ten submarines , he says , 100 miles off the United States West Coast , equipped with " dirty " nuclear missiles , could drench much of the country with lethal radioactive fallout . No Congressman , whatever his capacity for denial , wants to see his country destroyed . I am not arguing that we ought to love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following Lapp , Wiesner , York and other nuclear scientists on what we must do to save our country . STUART CHASE Georgetown , Conn. , Feb. 2 , 1967 ? For Single-House State Legislature To the Editor : Doubtless The New York Times is right ( editorial Jan. 31 ) that the large bloc of legislators at the forthcoming Constitutional Convention renders the idea of a unicameral legislature politically incapable of attainment . That does not mean , however , that the concept of the single-house legislature should be too quickly brushed aside . There are myriad reasons why a unicameral system is preferable to a bicameral system ? economy , efficiency , the possibility to provide better staffing , etc . None of these , however , would seem so important as the impact it would have upon public awareness of who their state legislator was . Voters Confused Recent Roper and Gallup polls taken immediately after the election ( when , supposedly , voter awareness is at its peak ) show that less than 20 per cent of the people can accurately identify either state legislator . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low 8 per cent of the electorate . The two-house system , where responsibility for either negative or positive action is lost in a cloud of committees , passages , amendments , conference committees between the two houses , and then final passage or defeat , leaves the average voter totally in the dark as to the action of his own Assemblyman or Senator or what , in fact , was the action of either house . The old argument that one house is needed to kill the precipitous action of the other is really rather faulty in a state like New York , where the Governor possesses strong veto powers and a wide range of other powers that aid him in seeing to it that his vetoes are upheld . ( In New York , the Governor regularly vetoes 25 per cent of the bills and is rarely overridden . ) This points up two fallacies to the **25;528;TOOLONG mews. sarst or all the " second " house seems to be letting a lot of legislation by it that our Governors have considered questionable . And , secondly , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The best way to improve the quality of legislation would be to improve the importance of a legislative career . Littleknown state legislators are hardly in a position to challenge a popular ' and powerful Governor . ( And they would be challenging him on major issues , not the trivial nonsense that a second house is now supposed to check . ) Closer Public Scrutiny The role of leading individuals within the legislature would be enhanced ; with only one majority leader , one chairman of the committee on education , etc. , these men and their positions would come uadar closer public scrutiny . Men would become known as experts in their field and their voices would carry greater weight when a legislative-executive dispute arose over policy . The Times was quite accurate  --  there are many things that need to be done to strengthen and streamline New York 's legislative institution . Also , unicameralism may be a totally lost cause . It would be refreshing , however , to see a real discussion of its merits take place at the convention . WILLIAM J. D. BOYD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Senior Associate of the National Municipal League and a member of the executive committee of the Citizens Committee for an Effective Constitution . ? Parking Permits for the Handicapped To the Editor : As long ago as 1900 the United States Supreme Court declared " Freedom of movement is basic in our scheme of values . " Since then the Federal and state governments have passed progressive legislation to rehabilitate handicapped people and enable us to throw off the shackles of medieval confinement and attitude . We are self-respecting participating members of society . Now , by not granting us parking permits , the Lindsay administration is perpetuating and reinforcing restraints on those few people , like myself , who are unable to use public transportation and do not go to business or to school . I am a wheelchair- bound housewife who drives a handcontrolled car . I can no longer shop for household necessities or go for medical treatment without danger of having my car ticketed or towed away . The human contact and mental stimulation enjoyed at theatres , museums , restaurants and parks are denied me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to park at a destination . Must we be house-bound prisoners in our own home town ? Are years of rehabilitation , thousands of dollars and dedicated work all for nought ? For those of us whose freedom depends upon the mobility that only our cars can give , a parking permit is a primary necessity . JACQUELINE BLOCK New York , Feb. 5 , 1967 ? Toll on Wildlife To the Editor : The Times is to be commended for the Jan. 24 editorial regarding African wildlife conservation . A particularly tragic situation concerns the leopard-coat fad , which has caused a terrible and unnecesary toll on that beautiful animal . Only through active support can conservation organizations maintain the exotic wildlife of Africa for future generations to enjoy . DANIEL SAMUELS District Representative East African Wild Life ' Society Mount Vernon , N. Y. Jan. 29 , 1967 ? Potter 's Field To the Editor : In The Times of Jan. 31 a news report on the contemplated suspension of the ferry service between Manhattan and Hart 's Island mentions Potter 's Field the burial ground on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name ? " potter 's field " ? is unknown . That surprises me , inasmuch as we are a country given to invoking Biblical quotations on any and all public occasions . Without having made any official inquiry , I assume that the original designation of the Hart 's Island cemetery as Potter 's Field could only derive from Matthew xxvii , 3,10 , the unforgettably dramatic passage dealing with Judas returning the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders , then going away and hanging himself : " And the chief priests took the silver pieces , and said , ' It is not lawful for to put them into the treasury , because it is the price of blood . And they took counsel , and bought with them the potter 's field , to bury strangers in . . . ' " The passage ends with a recollection of Jeremiah 's prophecy , " And they took the thirty pieces of silver , the price of him that was valued . . . and gave them for the potter 's field ... " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place is forgotten , who indeed will remember the poor souls buried there ? PATRICIA MACMANUS New York , Feb. 1 , 1967
