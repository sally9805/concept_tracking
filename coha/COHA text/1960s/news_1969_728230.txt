txt The French did n't plan it that way . They hardly intended to focus attention on their tiny but growing nuclear force de frappe ( strike force ) at just the moment when the world 's two biggest nuclear powers are meeting with a view to reducing their own nuclear arsenals . But that is what is happening : The United States and Soviet Union are engaged in long awaited Strategic Arms Limitations Talks in Helsinki . Meanwhile France prepares to launch another nuclear submarine . The contrast between Helsinki and Paris , hoWever , is causing no visible embarrassment among French military . leaders . They say in. effect that France is about to take one more step toward becoming d nuclear pOwer with which even the two superpowers must reckon carefully . France has other and bigger steps planned for the future . Dec. 11 launch planned But right away , on Dec. 11 , ' President Pompidou is expected to float France 's second nuclear sub Le Terrible . The ceremony is to take place at Brest , the naval base from which Gen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on March 29 , 1967 . ' The event catches French attention in two different ways . First it is a matter of pride to many vocally patriotic Frenchmen . It also reassures those Gaullists who wish General de Gaulle were still president . It symbolizes with hard tools of the trade a continuation of French foreign policy as laid down by the general . Its stress is on French " independence . " But many working people of France feel that its meaning is less clear . Progress for the force de frappe comes in a year of austerity and budget balancing . It highlights what many people regard as a Gaullist luxury , as an " expensive hobby " of the general 's when ' he was in power , and as a drain on funds that political opponents of the government say could better be used for social needs . To be sure , in the 1970 budget national defense is one of the items to show an increase over 1969 . It gets 27,188,000,000 francs . That equals $4,952,180,000 .. ? Relatively small outgo Even so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . defense outgo planned in 1970 is the smallest in 100 years in relation to the'oyerall budget . That is because the 1970 total budget is pp from 152,624,000,000 francs or $27,750,000,000 to 162,148,000,000 francs or $29,480,456,565 for 1970 . In the 1969 budget defense got 25,960,000,000 francs or $4,720,000,000 . The allotment for the force de frappe has remained at the 1969 figure however : 9,000,500,000 francs or $1 , - 727,000,000 . ? French officials regard these overall figures as reasonable , given the present unsettled state of the world . True , defense gets a bigger slice of the 1970 budget than does education . But the latter got a bigger increase over 1969 . It was up from 24 billion francs ( $4,300,000,000 ) to 26 billion francs or $4,730,000,000 . Moreover officials say that French spending on defense is lower relative to gross national product than it is in most other countries . The French percentage of 3.4 compares with 6 percent in Britain and 9 percent in the United States . ' // *French speed buildup of nuclear facilities // Also the proportion of defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decrease . In 1968 it was 20 per:cent . In 1969 it was 17.8 percent . In 1970 it as put at 17.6 percent . If any part of the defense budget looks like " luxury , " French officials say , these figures should help to clear away the mis. = conception . Mr. Debre recently pointed out that the cost of the force de frappe is smaller than the amount that French women spend in one year on cosmetics . ? French officials add that it buys some . thing not only essential to France 's national defense but basic to its foreign policy . That is , it provides an element which keeps France in the forefront of the effort to build a Europe capable in the future of defending itself . Three - powers envisioned This Europe , French officials say should be an independent force in a world which would then include three great nuclear powers , the United States , the Soviet Union , and militarily unified Europe . = ? The submarine launching in December will be followed by two others in 1971 and 1973 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry 16 missiles each . Beyond : : 1973 no decisions about submarines have ? been made . The most ambitious aspect of the French nuclear-weapons program will appear later . This is the aim to add to France 's present nuclear arms the most modern thermonuclear weapons  --  hydrogen bombs . An H-bomb device was successfully tested at France 's South Pacific testing ground in 1968 . The first H-bomb is expected to be operational in 1973 and the program is scheduled for completion by 1978 or 1980 . At that time , French officials estimate , the country will have at its disposal nuclear weapons with explosive power of between 80 and 100 megatons . Today it commands only 10 megatons . Smallness acknowledged The relative smallness of the French nuclear arsenal is frankly ackdowledged , even stressed , by French officials . They point out that the United States nuclear power amounts to 14,000 megatons and that  --  the Soviets have about the same power . Even with an arsenal of 100 megatons France might seem an inconsequential factor in a balance of power based on nuclear weapons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of French nuclear arms far exceeds that which might seem indicated by figures on explosive power . Some estimates place present French nuclear power at one quarter of that which might be carried in an American B-52 bomber . This seems negligible . But the French say their developing power could be useful to the Western defense system , if the West were attacked by an Eastern power with highly developed nuclear capacity .
