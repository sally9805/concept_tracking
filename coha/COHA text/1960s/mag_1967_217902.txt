DECISIONS &; VERDICTS <P> Every day , every week , U.S. courts resolve individual human conflicts - the stuff of the law that governs everyone else . Current examples : <P> One spinster can adopt another - at least in Maryland . For reasons of " in heritance and maternal feeling , " un married WAC Sergeant Dorothy Libertini , 56 , sought to adopt unmarried WAC Captain Frances Hagler , 35 . A Baltimore court denied the petition , reasoning that Captain Hagler would , in effect , become a spinster 's " illegitimate " daughter . Not so , ruled the Maryland Court of Appeals . Unmarried adults can adopt persons of any age for purposes of inheritance , and the result does not change the " social or domestic relation ship of either party . " Moreover , a probation officer 's report in the Libertini case " gives no intimation of wrongdoing or improper motive . " <P> Some commuting expenses are deductible on federal income-tax returns . <P> New York City Construction Worker Lawrence D. Sullivan drove his car to work and deducted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to drive to get his 32-lb. bag of wire lathing tools to distant jobs . The tax court disagreed , citing the general rule that job-commuting is no deductible business expense . But a U.S. Appellate Court upheld Sullivan , ruling that he can deduct " that portion of his reason able driving expenses which is allocable to the transportation of tools . " This means only cumbersome tools , such as a musician 's drums or a lumberjack 's sawing equipment , both of which were cleared in two prior cases . Not a thin briefcase . <P> A murder accomplice may get a life sentence while the alleged killers escape trial . Aristides Benitez Jr. , 18 , confessed that he and two other youths planned to hold up a Hartford grocer , but that he lost his nerve and stayed in the car while they attacked and killed the victim . Benitez was convicted of first-degree murder under the common rule that makes an accomplice equally culpable of the crime . But , except for Benitez ' confession , evidence to convict his buddies was lacking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his implicating statements against them were inadmissible as hearsay evidence , Benitez ' pals are thus far immune from prosecution . <P> Life insurance is payable for death caused by fright . When the 1964 earthquake hit Alaska , 100-ft-plus waves hurled the freighter Chena into the seaport town of Valdez and so terrified Third Mate Ralph Thompson that he died of a heart attack . The insurance company refused to pay Mrs. Thompson 's $25,000 claim , citing the fact that the policy covered only death from " bodily injury caused by accident , " not death from fright . In upholding Mrs. Thompson , a U.S. Appellate Court ruled that such a policy applies even when the victim dies from fear of an accident that is actually avoided - for example , a threatened head-on auto crash . In Thompson 's case , said the court , fear was the " predominant factor " that weakened his heart , and his widow gets the money .
