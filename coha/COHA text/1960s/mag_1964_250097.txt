Little Herbie Solomon was , every body said , a square . While the other saxophone players at Brooklyn 's Abra ham Lincoln High School were trying to imitate the new bebop style of Charlie ( " Bird " ) Parker . Herbie was still practicing to old Illinois Jacquet and Flip Phillips records . You 're not with it , Herbie , they said , and refused to let him play with the school 's dance band . <P> But Herbie endured , eventually changed his name and instrument , and , as Jazz Flutist Herbie Mann , has be come at 34 one of the most successful jazzmen in the business . This week he was voted the top musician in his field for the eighth consecutive year in the Down Beat magazine readers ' poll . But , to the inner circle of jazz aficionados , Herbie is still not with it . Mainly , says Mann , " because I 've committed the cardinal sin of being successful . " <P> Languid Afternoons . With a canny eye on the box office , Mann @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fringe public " with a unique amalgam of jazz and ethnic music . Last week , in Manhattan 's cavernous Village Gate , the Herbie Mann Septet was serving up one of its typical jazz potpourris : gently infectious bossa nova , thumping Afro-Cuban , variations on a North African tribal chant , a Middle Eastern treatment of the theme from Fiddler on the Roof , a brooding interpretation of a classical piano piece writ ten in 1888 by French Composer Erik Satie . Mann also introduced a new gimmick : he played a flute improvisation against a tape recording of eerily exotic , centuries-old gagaku music , played by the royal musicians of Japan 's imperi al court , a memento picked up when Mann played with the gagaku musicians during a tour of Japan three months ago . <P> Mann 's flute is a sparrow in the treetops , lightly flitting and chirping above a heavy , sensuous beat laid down by the rhythm section On alto flute , the mood is more softly introspective , evoking languid afternoons by the sea . The music is easy on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ap proach . Mann plays with eyes closed , standing disjointedly and undulating as if to entwine himself around the microphone , conscious that " some chicks just come to see me move . They 're stone-deaf freaks , but I 'm not knocking it . " He does n't knock anything , in fact , that might lure people into a nightclub . Last year , to add a little " carnival excitement , " he hired two Afro-Cuban dancers who cavorted about the stage showering the audience with confetti . Such tactics , scorned by jazz purists , bring Mann a $50,000 yearly income . <P> Mann scored his breakthrough when he discovered that the gentle flute , an upstaged squeak in the company of flashy trumpets and saxophones , could best flex its personality against a background of drums . Mann formed an Afro-Jazz Sextet and embarked in 1959 on a highly successful four-month tour of 17 African countries . <P> Boom-Boom . Back in the U.S. the combo 's " ethnic jazz " gained a wide audience . But in the mounting din of his drummers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group " and he fled to Brazil . He came back playing a new music that helped touch off the bossa-nova craze in the U.S.
