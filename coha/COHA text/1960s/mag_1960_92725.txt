Not since the days of Bernie Bierman had Minneapolis cheered so lustily . Led by Fullback Roger Hagberg , here setting off on a 42-yard run for the game 's decisive touchdown , Minnesota last Saturday took all the speed Iowa had to offer and simply crushed the Hawkeyes . The Gophers were again the nation 's number one team , and the happiest man of all , after bitter years of waiting , was Coach Murray Warmath. // FEVER IN MINNEAPOLIS // Apparently there is such a disease as football fever . It may lie dormant for years , hidden away in yellowing scrapbooks or deep inside the victim 's chest . Unlike most epidemics , it does not feed upon the downtrodden It waits , instead , until everything is coming up roses and then it strikes . Last week it hit the state of Minnesota , incapacitating Minneapolis and leaving even St. Paul on the verge of a terrific sneeze . // The Twin Cities on the banks of the Mississippi will have a new big league baseball team next year , and they 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Minneapolis and St. Paul are very enthusiastic about this because they love baseball and they love pro football , but last weekend the transplanted Senators and the football Vikings could have raced down Nicollet Avenue astride giraffes , with Nixon and Kennedy waiting at the finish line to kiss the winner , and no one in Minneapolis would have bothered to look around . The University of Minnesota was playing the University of Iowa . Nothing was ever so important as this . // It was more than a football game , more even than a contest for the Big Ten lead . Iowa was undefeated in six games ; so was Minnesota . Iowa was ranked first in the nation in both wire-service polls ; Minnesota was ranked second in one , third in the other . Forest Evashevski , the moody magician of Iowa football , was preparing to retire from coaching and he wanted to walk out a winner ; Murray Warmath , who had suffered through some of the most miserable seasons in Minnesota history , had been hounded and harried by old Gophers long enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iowa was fast and deceptive and brilliant ; Minnesota was strong and steady and sure . // The 63,255 seats at Memorial Stadium had been sold out for weeks , enabling industrious individuals with little moral character but maximum foresight to collect $100 for a pair of tickets within the 20-yard lines . Eventually the attendance reached 65,610 , a stadium record . Not a hotel or motel room was available within 20 miles . More than 30 radio stations in Minnesota , the Dakotas and Iowa were poised to broadcast the game to those who could n't get in , and an educational outlet in the Twin Cities was commandeered to produce the classic on TV . " We do n't give a damn for the whole State of Iowa " rolled inharmoniously out of every bar . And coeds , who had not spoken to football players for years , now kissed them openly , and wept . // There are places where it is possible to win six football games in a row without the populace going berserk , but Minneapolis on Saturday was not one of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bierman were the scourge of the Big Ten and the nation . They won six conference championships in the years 1934-1941 and four times were named the best college football team in all the land . But with the beginning of World War II the fortunes of Minnesota faded , and after seven years Murray Warmath has just begun to restore some of the glory . " It takes a long time , " he says , " to get a sick horse up . " // Warmath , a big man with a tough , homely face and a deep growl for a voice , played football under General Bob Neyland at Tennessee ; later he coached at Tennessee under Neyland and at Army under Red Blaik , and he is not accustomed to losing . But he has had to get used to it at Minnesota . He has had good seasons there as well as bad , but the good ones were never quite good enough and the bad ones had a way of turning into nightmares . The 1956 team was knocked out of the Rose Bowl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a preseason Big Ten favorite , was a tragic disappointment . The 1958 team won only one game . And the 1959 team , with superb but inexperienced young players , lost five Big Ten games by a total of 32 points , then lost to Iowa 33-0 , and fell into the conference cellar . The team over which Warmath most frequently woke up screaming was Iowa . Warmath beat Evashevski in 1954 , then lost to him five straight times . // Yet Minnesota holds a wide edge in the series with 34 victories , 18 losses and one tie . There was a time  --  after the famed Minnesota fullback , Sheldon Beise , tackled the famed Iowa halfback , Ozzie Simmons , with injurious results in 1934  --  when every Iowan was convinced that the only purpose of the game , as far as Minnesota was concerned , was to see how many Iowans could be maimed . It became unsafe , therefore , to appear in Iowa City or Cedar Rapids with Minnesota license plates on your car . But then the governors of the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1935 game , and apparently there was just enough of the absurd about playing for a pig to cool everyone off . Today Floyd of Rosedale , a bronze replica of that original old boar , is the annual trophy that goes to the winner , and although Minnesota and Iowa sometimes continue to play rough in attempting to claim him , at least the contest is recognizable as football . // Warmath would rather beat Iowa and Evashevski than anyone else , and he particularly needed to beat them on Saturday . Naturally , as a coach , he has suffered by comparison with the man who brought Iowa from the ranks of the have-nots to the peak of football success with his brilliant tactics , unpredictable strategy and remarkable recruiting ability . Warmath does not consider Evashevski one of his closest friends and he only mutters something about " genius " when the name comes up . But aside from a deep personal desire to triumph over the Iowa man , Warmath needed to win to insure his job . // The University of Minnesota is a huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in business since 1851 . Warmath is constantly amazed by the number of alumni who seem to be occupied solely with snarling at his door . But he stood them off in 1958 when they demanded that he resign and again last fall , when a group of Minneapolis businessmen offered to buy up the two remaining years of his five-year contract for $35,000. // " Why do you stay here and take all this ? " an assistant once asked . // " Because I 'm a good football coach , " said Warmath , " and I want to prove it . " // Certainly he proved it in the first six games of 1960 . His players carried him off the field after the Gophers beat Illinois and again after they beat Michigan , and to a man who has grown accustomed to walking alone down the long , dark corridors of defeat this must have seemed like pretty fancy transportation . After Minnesota walloped Kansas State in a warmup game last weekend , big red-white-and-blue buttons saying " Warmath for President " began to show up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iowa .... // " This is the most important game , " said Warmath , " that any team of mine has ever played . " // The two football teams that trotted onto the field before the huge , howling mob on Saturday were as great a study in contrast as their coaches . Speed has always been an Evashevski trademark , but the 1960 Hawkeyes are unbelievably fast ; every man in the first three backfields can outrun anyone on the entire Minnesota team . Three halfbacks  --  Larry Ferguson , Jerry Mauren and Sam Harris  --  and Fullback Joe Williams had each averaged better than five yards a carry . And while Wilburn Hollis , the 200-pound quarterback out of Possum Trot , Miss , by way of Nebraska 's Boys Town , is not much of a passer , he too can run so well that many Iowans consider him the best quarterback Evashevski has ever had . Better than Jerry Reichow or Kenny Ploen , better even than 1958 All-America Randy Duncan . // The Hawkeyes had scored over half of their touchdowns on long runs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long , sudden touchdown pass . That is the word for Iowa  --  sudden . The Iowans play daring , wide-open football , running from a confusing cluster of formations , and they pounce like terriers on any opponent 's mistake . It is an exciting team with great scoring ability . // Warmath figured before the game that his problem was simple enough . // " We have to spread our defense to keep them between the ends , " he said . " And we have to play back to keep them from getting behind us . We have to pinch them into as small an area as possible . We do n't intend to give them anything , but the question is whether in spreading out like this to contain their wide stuff we are going to be giving up too much down the middle . " // On offense , Warmath intended to play the game as he learned to play it and as he has always played it : controlling the play , grinding out yardage , kicking on third down in his own territory , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistakes . " That has been our success formula this year , " he said . " We have lost the ball on fumbles and interceptions only eight times ; we have got the football on fumbles and interceptions 22 times . We have more depth in the line than Iowa , and we can outkick them . We can move the ball , too . If our defense can contain their outside speed , we should win . " // Minnesota is not an exciting team when it attacks . The standout in the backfield most of the season has been Sandy Stephens , a junior quarterback from Pennsylvania ( " We finally had to go outside Minnesota to get quarterbacks and halfbacks and ends , " admits Warmath ) . Stephens weighs 215 pounds and would rather run than throw . The Gophers are massive , with a line that averages 220 pounds , and right in the middle of it is a 243-pound guard named Tom Brown , who has legs like tree trunks , the movements of a big cat , and is perhaps the best interior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man in front of him for three years , " says Warmath. // There is also a 260-pound tackle , Fran Brixius , who can block ; a 220-pound sophomore tackle , Bob Bell , who can crash ; and defensive ends named Bob Deegan and Dick Larson , who have been extremely tough on opposing passers all year . The line had held six teams to a total of 31 points before the Iowa game . // Originally , Iowa was favored by 6 ? points , but by Monday before the game the spread was down to 1 ? in Minneapolis . By Tuesday it was down to a point , by Thursday to half a point . On Saturday the game was considered even . // As it turned out , the game was n't even at all . Minnesota 's marvelous line , led by Brown , whipped Iowa to a stubble . The Gophers made a runaway of the contest with three second-half touchdowns , won 27-10 , and returned Floyd of Rosedale to Minnesota after an absence of six years . When it was all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 team in the nation . // The Gophers scored their only first-half touchdown on a bad Iowa play in the first quarter . Hawkeye Center Bill Van Buren , who had not made a poor snap all season , sailed the football back over John Calhoun 's head on a fourth-down punt attempt , and Minnesota took over on the Iowa 14 . The Gophers scored in three plays , Bill Muncey taking a pitchout from Stephens and circling left end for the last seven yards . Jim Rogers kicked the first of three successful conversions . // Iowa drove 60 yards to the Minnesota five midway in the second period , but then Brown and Co. pushed the Hawkeyes back five yards in three plays and Tom Moore kicked a field goal for Iowa from 18 yards out . // The swift Iowa backs would sometimes shake partially loose for 15 or 20 yards , but the yardage was gained inside tackle , never outside end , and most of the time that big Minnesota line was chasing Iowa runners in the opposite direction . The Gopher deep defenders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the long-distance punting of Stephens kept Iowa backed up in its own end of the field . And all through those two punishing quarters the Hawkeye line was taking a terrible beating . // Iowa scored first in the second half to go into a 10-7 lead . Evashevski 's tricky double reverse ate up 19 yards in five plays , and then Joe Williams popped through the middle , wiggled past two Minnesota linebackers and ran 20 yards to score . Moore kicked the point . // But the rest of the way the game belonged to Minnesota . The Gophers , whose offense had been virtually nonexistent in the first half , powered 81 yards to a touchdown in 12 plays before the third quarter was over . Roger Hagberg , a 205-pound senior fullback who was to gain 103 yards in 15 carries during the afternoon , caught a very important third-down pass from Stephens ' third-string substitute , little Joe Salem , for 28 yards , and then ran through center for 18 more to put the ball on the Iowa eight . Stephens followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later from one yard out . Rogers missed the kick , but it was 13-10 , and Minnesota had proved it could move the ball against Iowa  --  just as Warmath had said . // In the fourth quarter Hagberg moved the ball 42 yards on one big play . Gopher Tackle Jim Wheeler recovered an Iowa fumble on the Iowa 42 , and Hagberg immediately broke through the middle , shook off tacklers , cut to his left and sailed across the goal . The touchdown came with a little less than five minutes left , and by now Minnesota was having fun . Bob Deegan , the Gopher end , hit an Iowa passer so hard that he fumbled , and four plays later Minnesota scored again . // It was n't fancy football , the way Minnesota played the game , but it was very impressive . Purdue and Wisconsin are going to have trouble producing something better in the next two weeks . If they ca n't , Minnesota will win its first Big Ten championship in 19 years . And if that does n't make Murray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
