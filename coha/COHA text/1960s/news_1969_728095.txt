txt Washington , Sept. ** Nixon announced today that he is cutting draft calls for the last three months of the year by 50.000 men . He warned Congress that unless it acts to remove what he called inequities in the draft law by the end of this session he will do so by executive order . Under the reformed draft law , men would be vulnerable to the draft for only one year instead of seven years as they are new . The President , in a brief statement to the press in the White House , said that the November draft call for 32,000 men and the December call for 18,000 would be canceled . He said the October call for 29,000 men will be spread out over the three months . Later Melvin R. Laird , secretary of defense , explained the draft cuts and the administration 's plans for draft reform in detail . He said that the January draft call now programmed for 35,000 men will be reviewed in December . He said that whether it would remain at that figure depends on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as criteria for the withdrawal of the American troops from Viet Nam  --  progress in the Paris peace talks , withdrawals of North Vietnamese troops from the south , and continuing improvement of South Viet Nam 's armed forces . Factors in Cut Nixon said the draft cut was " made possible by reduction in our forces of 60,000 in Viet Nam which I announced on Tuesday and by other actions taken by the department of defense under the manpower program . " The President announced Tuesday that 35,000 more men would be withdrawn from Viet Nam by Dec. 15 . Earlier he ' had announced the withdrawal of 25,000 men . The " other actions " he referred to apparently arc moves by Laird to cut the authorized strength of the armed forces by 150,000 men since the Nixon administration took office . Laird said today that further man power cuts will be announced Monday . Withdrawals Not Basis Laird also said that the draft cut is not predicated on further possible withdrawals from Viet Nam after Dec. 15 . Even with the cut , replacements will be available for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15 . Asked if the cut could be construed as a de-escalation designed to get Hanoi to agree to end the fighting , Laird said : " I hope they look at this as progress in the military part of the Vietnamization program . " In putting Congress on notice that he would act on draft reform if it did n't , the President noted that last May he submitted legislation under which only men between the ages of 19 and 20 would be subject to the draft on a random selection basis . Under the existing draft law , men are subject to the draft from 19 thru 26 . Will Ile Sent Soon If Congress does not act on draft reform legislation before the end of this session , he said , shall take , by unilateral action , by executive order , the recommendation of the secretary of defense . . . which will move toward that objective and which will remove uncertainties from the age group of 20 to 26 , altho it will not accomplish the objective as clearly and as fairly as the legislation if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really has to do to make true random selection possible is to repeal one sentence of the selective service act of 1967 that specifies that the oldest men in any draft pool must be called first . He said proposed legislation to repeal that sentence will be sent to the Congress soon . If the sentence is repealed , the random selection process would work as follows : For each year , a slip of paper for each day of the year will be put in a bowl and drawn out at random . If the first clay drawn , for example , is June 15 , those young men between 19 and 20 who were born on June 15 would be the first to be called . If the second day drawn is April 1 , those born on that date would be the next to be called . And so on . Calls on Congress If the sentence is not repealed , the President would , by executive order , institute what Laird called a moving age group system . Under this system , one day in every month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have started on that day . Thus , if June 15 is picked , those young men born on June 15 would be the first to be called in that month . Those born on the 16th would be next , and so on . In the following month a new date would be picked . Under either system , anyone who is not drafted by the time he turns 20 will no longer be subject to the draft . Laird called on Congress to repeal the sentence blocking the random selection system , saying the moving age group system " is very complicated and it can not truly accomplish a random selection system because the oldest-first rule must be followed each month in selecting men from the prime group . " Later , Sen. Mike Mansfield D. , Mont . , Senate majority leader , said he doubts that any draft reform bill would be passed in this session because of the crowded congressional schedule . He added that he thought Nixon would have " the complete support of Congress for any reforms he can make by executive order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , chairman of the House armed services committee , said his committee would be ready to consider draft reforms by November . He said that if the President institutes the moving age group system , it would be virtually the same thing as the random selection system and a change in the law might not be needed .
