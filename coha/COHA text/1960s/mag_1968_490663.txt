THE TALK . OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment WRITING in the Timer recently , Arthur Miller , the playwright , set forth the view that Americans arc contributing to an Age of Abdication , because they have been knocked so " morally silly " that they will neither affirm nor deny the insanity of our presence in Vietnam . " I 'm speaking of the great majority , of course , " Mr. Miller says , generously exculpating " protesters ! ' We think Mr. Miller is misreading the public temper . We do n't believe for a minute that " the great majority " has abdicated its concern over the Vietnamese struggle . in our opinion , the general run of Americans  --  whether hawks or doves , or neither  --  are deeply preoccupied with the war . It has lasted too long and created too much havoc and pain for things to be otherwise . The poison of its existence infects the country 's daiI ) life , and we doubt whether this is discernible only to Mr. Miller and his select group . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  to recognize that the government ( and , with it , the rest of us ) is in the toils of a terrible misadventure in Asia . The problem is how to get out of the mistake without compounding it . Apparently , however , this is n't anything to which Mr. Miller cares to address his attention . All he seems to want is for everyone to stand up and he counted  --  which to our mind is a step of limited value . It takes no account of the dilemma at hand , and to bypass that , we think , is to impoverish the meaning of affirmation or denial , en which Mr. Miller rests his case . It does not seem to occur to him that many of his countrymen may be expressing their determination to end the war by weighing choices rather than by registering protest . We are hardly suggesting that one excludes the other , but we ourself do n't sec how peace can he brought about without the discovery of political solutions that are fair and workable . %Vc would welcome them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and those with a similar approach . Naturally , we do n't consider it incumbent on dissidents , in the United States or elsewhere , to provide solutions . It would be nice , though , if the people who seem to place their faith in protest alone perceived the existence of a world other than their own  --  a larger one , which is n't inhabited by moral dropouts but is racked by genuine controversy . The greater the majority that acknowledges the fact of that controversy , the sooner it is likely to he re-solved . Film Club THE first movie that Raymond ( Monello ) Esquilin made at the Film Cluh  --  a storefront youth center on the lower East Side  --  was a seven-minute black-and-white short called " The Dream . " The action unfolds without dialogue , against a background of rock-'n ' - roll music . The first shot shows a teen-age boy entering a dark , cluttered bedroom . The boy undresses down to his underwear and climbs into bed . As he tosses and turns , trying to get to sleep , a yarn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shelf onto his face . The boy hurls it to the floor . It lies there , its expressionless eyes staring upward . Now the boy 's eyes close , and he dreams he is playing a set of steel drums with a friend in a basement room . We see the two of them sitting side by side , sharing a smoke and laughing together . The next moment , his friend has vanished . The boy is alone in the room . He tries the door , but it will not open . He pounds on the walls . There i5 no way out . Then he realizes that the octopus doll , come to life , is after him . The doll stalks him , corners him , and springs . He falls to the floor with the doll around his neck , its button eyes staring , its tentacles tightening in a death grip .

" The Dream " was one of the big hits of last summer 's Moviebus project , in which members of the Film Club exhibited films they had made them-selves and films made by other teen-agers to large , informal crowds on the streets of ghetto neighborhoods throughout New York . For many of the members it was not only their first exposure to a critical audience but also their first venture beyond the geo-graphical boundaries of their own neighborhood  --  the tangle of streets be-low East Houston that were once the heart of the- city 's archetypal Jewish ghetto and are now predominant-ly Puerto Rican . The club itself is at 11 Rivington Street , down the block from the University Settlement . The storefront is divided into a cramped work-room and an even more cramped projection room , both poorly heated and lighted but always jammed with youthful filmmakers , who keep up a rapid banter in English and Spanish while waiting for their turns on the splicers and viewers and rewind reels . ( Behind the projection room is a con-crete yard , in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hens and the crowing of roosters ac-company the otherwise silent run-throughs of the latest rushes . ) On week-ends , the filmmakers spill out onto the streets , sharing three available cameras and the available ghetto themes and backgrounds , and acting in and ar-guing about each other 's productions . The entire neighborhood , it seems , has become filial-conscious since December of 1966 , when an art teacher named 20 JANUARY 1 3 , 1 9 6 8 ? Rodger Larson arrived on the scene with a thirty-year-old Cind Kodak camera and a theory about the importance of motion pictures as a means of self-expression for today ' s teen-agers . Larson , who is thirty-three years old , comes from New Haven ; he received a degree in commercial art from Pratt Institute , and had begun a Madison Avenue career as an industrial designer when he decided that his real interest lay in art education . In 1959 , after taking courses in art education at New York University night school , he got a job designing and administering an arts-and-theatre program at the Moshoht-Montefiore Community Center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time in an area of Manhattan that would soon come to he known as the East Village , and he recalls , " There were underground filmmakers coming out of the wall all over the neighborhood . I saw some of their work and thought I could do as well . " Eventually , he talked the Mosholu-Montefiore Center into letting him do a documentary on his own theatre-arts project . When he discovered that the teen-agers involved were " even more intrigued with the mechanics of filming than they were ? with being in the film , " he handed them the camera and let them try for themselves . The results were " so exciting , so profoundly creative " that he started wondering what would happen if he set up a program for young people based entirely on filmmaking . In the fall of 1964 , he left IlilosholuMontefiore and went looking for someone willing to back him in a full-scale experiment . The financing that he was finally able to piece together is a crazy quilt of small foundation grants and gifts and subsidies from various public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United Neighborhood Houses-Neighhorhnod Youth Corps , which also pays stipends to the youthful participants , at the rate of a dollar and a half an hour ( up to thirty hours a week ) . Larson has a teaching assistant , a young Chilean filmmaker named Jaime Barrios , who is supported by a grant from the New York State Council on the Arts , and the Council is also responsible for the processing of film  --  fifty thousand feet of outdated but still usable sixteen-millimetre high-speed black-and-white negative , donated by ABC-TV . The storefront is provided , rent-free , by the University Settlement , and other contribut. ons  --  for technical equipment and office expenses  --  have come from the New York Foundation and the Children 's Cultural Foundation . Th latter agency is also arranging for the distribution of Film Club productions to schools , churches , community centers , and cinema societies , and the Office of Cultural Affairs of the City of New York is helping Larson search for still more sponsors , so that he can put the Movichus hack on the streets this summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two-thirds of whom are still attending school . Moncho Esquilin , who is nineteen years old , studied electrical installation and practice at Chelsea Vocational High School until last April , and then quit , a year short of graduation . His stated reason for quitting is " They would n't let me wear a mustache , " but it is clear that he did n't like school , or the idea of becoming an electrician , and that he does like filmmaking . Since he completed " The Dream , " he has shot another seven-minute short , " The Thief , " about a boy who steals some money to buy a ticket to a movie theatre and is punished by a guilty conscience , and he is planning his next project , a thirty-minute satiric fairy tale , with a synchronized sound track and a cast of twelve . He is also teaching a beginners ' course in filmmaking to a group of neighborhood girls .

" Alejandro Lopez , who is twenty years old and is a veteran of several Broadway and TV acting roles as well as a year 's tour of duty as a paratrooper in Vietnam , is shooting a film about a young tough who leads an insurrection against an insecure substitute teacher and takes over the classroom . And Jesus Cruz , a nineteen-year-old senior at the Brooklyn Automotive High School , is working on his second film  --  the story of a gang fight , starring his friend Moncho Esquilin . Jesus , like Moncho , intends to make a career of the motionpicture business . " At first , I joined the club because all my friends joined ; then I got interested , " he says .

" It 's calmed down now , " he said the other day . " I do n't know why . Maybe the Law 's stronger . And there 's more to do  --  more clubs , more activities . " Moncho , looking up from a splicer , nodded in agreement . " Everybody 's making films now , " he said . Convocation PICTURESQUE sights abound , if you I know where to look for them . Having received an invitation from the hoard of trustees and the faculty of the New York Medical College to attend a morning convocation for the installation of its new president , David Denker , we showed up at the appointed place  --  the Renaissance building of the New York Academy of Medicine , at 103rd Street and Fifth Avenue  --  and found ourself in a large auditorium sprinkled with guests in mufti . Presently , to the accompaniment of a Corelli processional on the organ , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearing the college mace , anothci young man bearing the flag of the United States , President Denker and his trustees , and some seventy delegates from Yale , Princeton , Vassar , Barnard , Harvard Medical School , the Medical Society of the State of New York , and other halls of learning . With one exception ( Sister Colette Mahoney , of Marymount Manhattan College ) , all the delegates wore mortarboards  --  some with gold tassels , some with red  --  and academic robes , whose colors included not only black and red but yellow , green , blue , and purple . Practically all the delegates also wore beatific expressions . The trustee-and-presidential group , along with what turned out to he other speakers of the day ( most of them capped and gowned ) , joined the mace and the Stars and Stripes on a chrysanthemum-decorated platform ; the delegates settled in center seats . The rear of the procession was brought up by the flag of the college ( a red cross on a yellow-and-white field ) and a detachment of young women in lightblue-and-white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who took seats at the hack of the room . As the national anthem , led by Mrs. Gloria DeNard , of the James Weldon Johnson Community Center , was rousingly rendered by one and all , the gowned males doffed their caps ; the ladies kept theirs on . After an invocation by a minister , caps were replaced , and Jackson E. Spears , chairman of the hoard of the college and a retired textile man , rose from his seat on the platform , extended greetings to Dr. Denker , who was wearing the regalia of a Yale Ph.D. , and wound up a brief speech with " May God guide you and give you strength . " A convocation address was delivered by Paul N. Ylvisaker , Commissioner of Community Affairs of the State of New Jersey , who was wearing the robes of a Harvard Ph.D . " Ever since last summer , we are a nation in anxious doubt ... this tragic flaw , we wonder , does it lie in our virtue or in our vice , and which is which ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Sisyphus , the Tower of Babel , Jacob Riis , Zoroaster , the . ancient Greeks , and Franklin D. Roosevelt . Next , John Ciardi , the poetry editor of the Saturday Review ( in the gown of a Tufts College Doctor of Literature ) , read a poem called " From the Beating End of the Stethoscope . " This began , " Invited by occasion to say what I can toward a ceremony of anatomical man , " and concluded , " Now let art guide him and let science shoe him . I say you 're wise to hitch your wagon to him . " The subject of this encomium , small , alert-looking man with a Chaplinesque mustache , was formally invested , and launched into another somewhat worried address : " The crisis of today is not one of knowledge . It is a crisis of responsibility and of social philosophy , a crisis stigmatized by inadequacy and unavailability .... We are crowding ourselves away from our own banquet table . " Honorary degrees were conferred ( on the Messrs . Spears and Ylvisaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a rabbi , and a Purcell recessional was s/ Iunded on trumpet and organ . We had a chat with Dr. Denker later in the day , and found him less worried . " I was horn in Denver , in 1915 , " he said . " My father died when , I was sixteen months old , and my mother brought me and my five brothers and sisters to New York when I was eleven . We lived in a tenement in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn . We slept around a coal stove . I went to P.S. 84 . The neighborhood funeral parlor was owned by a Mr. Caruso , and I 'd sit there , cool as a encumber , in the summer and mind the store while he went home to have lunch with Mrs. Caruso , the most beautiful woman I ever saw .

" He continued , " I went to Yale on a scholarship  --  I was the oldest undergraduate in New Haven  --  and graduated in two years with a Phi Beta Kappa key . I took my doctorate and joined the faculty as the oldest history instructor in New Haven . " In 1952 , Mason Gross , who was then provost of Rutgers , beckoned Dr. Denker to an assistant professorship . In 1956 , he became the assistant provost and an associate professor of social science there . Two years later , he became assistant to the president and a full professor .

Coler Memorial Hospital and Home , on Welfare Island . " I 'm hoping that we can begin to raise our sights in the curriculum without whittling away at quality , " the Doctor said , starting to sound worried again . Rebellion EVERY now and then , something happens to remind us that Now York is really two cities  --  a visible collection of streets , parks , buildings , and sidewalks , superimposed on an invisible labyrinth of wires , tunnels , rails , and pipes . The invisible New York , percolating quietly beneath its concreteand-asphalt surface , is an odd and unpredictable place . The available maps of it arc often inaccurate , and the various people who maintain and repair this intricate underworld ( Con Edison , the Department of Water Supply , Gas , and Electricity , the Transit Authority ) operate with a remarkable degree of independence from one another . The result is the kind of confusion that can transform a minor accident into a major calamity . We witnessed a near miss not long ago , when a friend who lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at about five o'clock on a Sunday morning . " It 's happening , baby , right outside my windowl " he announced , in a tremulous voice . " There 's been a steam explosion , and it 's like the end of the world on Sixteenth Street . The apartment is shaking like a leaf , the street is full of fire engines , and the air looks like London fog . It 's a block-long psychcdelic experience . Get right down here . " We hastened downtown , and found our friend behind a police harrier , gazing blissfully at a Pop Art version of Dante 's Inferno that had engulfed the intersection of Seventh Avenue and Sixteenth Street . A thick column of white steam rose majestically from a crater in the sidewalk and billowed toward us in enormous clouds , enveloping a long line of fire engines and police cars . Red and white lights flashed through the fog like unidentified flying objects ; black-coated firemen darted back and forth across the street in frantic but futile activity as a warm spring rain ( the condensed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our feet vibrated with a dull , visceral roar  --  a combination of Niagara Falls and a jet engine on takeoff  --  and the people who were huddled behind the harrier looked sleepily scared . We asked a fireman what had happened , and discovered that water from a water-main break several hours earlier had seeped across Sixteenth Street and surrounded a Con Ed live-steam main . " The steam was under one hundred and forty pounds of pressure per square inch , and the pipe went up like a bomb , " the fireman said . " Blew the manhole cover across Seventh Avenue , broke some windows in the apartment house on the corner , and put the sub-way out between Fourteenth and Thirty-fourth Streets . We 're lucky nobody was hurt , " " This city is in a state of rebellion against its inhabitants , " our friend said , coming out of his trance . " One of these days , the ground will open and swallow us all . " As we watched the column of steam , it vanished with the suddenness of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trudged up to our friend 's apartment to get some sleep on his living-room sofa . When we returned to the intersection of Seventh Avenue and Sixteenth Street that afternoon , the entire area resembled the site of a major construction project . The streets had been closed to traffic and were filled with piles of sand , heaps of metal piping , and rows of parked trucks  --  red for the Fire Department ( which was pumping nut flooded basements ) , orange for Con Edison , and dark green for the Department of Water Supply , Gas , and Electricity . Yellow wooden barriers bearing the stencilled message " Sorry , Pipe Bust ; Fix We Must " kept pedestrians at a respectful distance . Workmen wearing orange and yellow safety helmets were scooping up mud and rock from the bottoms of two enormous excavations an oblong hole in the side-walk on the north side of Sixteenth Street ( where the steam main had exploded ) and a square hole in the middle of Seventh Avenue ( the site of the water-main break ) . A twenty-foot section of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of steam and water to form a series of rather decorative rigid asphalt waves . We walked over to the Con Edison hole and watched an orange crane lift out a chunk of steaming pipe and deposit it gently near a twisted fire hydrant . The foreman , a genial man in a red jacket , told us that Con Ed was replacing the old twelve-inch main with two smaller ones to eliminate the possibility of another explosion . " What actually went was an upright valve at the stub end of the steam main , " lie said . " The steam blew a section of pavement apart and went straight up in the air , which is why nobody was hurt . We had to shut down most of the valves in the area to reduce the pressure , so there are now six buildings along Seventh Avenue without steam heat . I hope we 'll get everything fixed up by midnight . " Moving on to the water-main hreak , we discovered that it presented a more difficult problem , because the damaged pipe had been resting on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was much older than the power THE NEW YOH lines , had settled , over the years , onto a concrete slab that contained an unknown number of live wires . To complicate matters further , digging had uncovered a gas main on one side of the break and a second live-steam line on the other . Joseph Pagano , the Borough superintendent for water repairs , told us that he was waiting fur some Transit Authority Power Department maintenance men , who would chip away a section of the concrete and form a kind of saddle to hold the new piece of pipe . " We ca n't touch that block , because we do n't know where the wires are , " said Mr. Pagano , a short , gray-haired man who was wearing a black raincoat and an orange helmet . He took us over to a truck and showed us the damaged water main  --  an enormous rusted pipe with a two-foot tear in it . " My liffice called at one-thirty this morning , and I got down here from die Bronx about twenty minutes later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major break , but we could n't tell exactly where it was ; the pavement had buckled , and there was a large surface flow of water . We used Geophonesinstruments that detect a leak by sound and we had just started to break the pavement when the steam valve blew , about fifteen minutes to five . There was a terrific roar , rocks started flying , and everybody- , including me , ran across the street . When Con Edison turned off the steam , we went back to work , and we uncovered the break about ten-thirty this morning . " Three Transit Authority men arrived a few minutes inter and began to chip cautiously away at the muddy concrete in the bottom of the pit . The faces of the other workmen wore anxious expressions that made it very evident that the crumpled diagram they had brought with them did not show the exact position of the wires . Since the T.A . men were standing in six inches of water , a chance encounter with an electrical line could cause a serious , possibly fatal accident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his workmen jumped into the excavation and began to brush away the loose concrete chips with extreme care . Mr. Pagano circled the edge- of the excavation at a brisk trot , switching on floodlights and shouting orders . Two workmen began heating lead to snider the new pipe in place ; a third adjusted a small pump that was drawing off water from the bottom of the pit . An elderly , pinch-faced man , who had been sent out from the Comptroller 's office to assess the damage , shook his head gloomily and made some notes on a clipboard . We remarked to him that the three-hour hiatus between the discovery of the water-main break and the steam-main explosion was quite a long time . Why had n't Con Edison turned riff the steam earlier ? The man from the Comptrolier 's office gave us a long , level look and said , " Confusion , This city thrives on confusion . " At nine-fifteen , the two Transit men surfaced , having finished their work , and a five-foot replacement for the damaged water main was lowered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crew packed Strands of hemp around a crack where two pieces of pipe met . Then they clamped a Long , flexible asbestos tube called a snake around the outside of the joint and poured molten lead into one end of it from a small metal bucket . There was a brief sputter and a puff of blur smoke , and the soldering was completed . " One down and two to gel , " said Mr. Pagano , looking a trifle less grim . A car flashed past us in the night , and we realized that Seventh Avenue had been reopened to traffic . The trucks and fire engines had disappeared , and the two lighted excavations glowed in the dark street . As the crew started to work on the next joint , a large man in a tweed overcoat walked up to Mr. Pagano and whacked him across the shoulders . " Hey , Joe , " he said , " What took you so long to repair this simple little kale ? " Mr. Pagano looked annoyed , and then began to smile . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twentieth cigarette of the evening . " And there were two other breaks last night  --  not as big as this one but big enough . Do you know how much sleep I 've had since Friday ? Seven hours , "
