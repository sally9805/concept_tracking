WANDERER by Sterling Hayden . 434 pages . Knopf. $6.95 . <P> <P> He had no screen career to speak of - nothing to compare with Cooper or Gable or Bogart . But Sterling Hayden was a celebrity of sorts in Hollywood . His irresistible appeal was that he was the authentic article . He had gone to sea at 17 , dory-trawling for haddock , hake and scrod from ramshackle schooners on the stormy Newfoundland banks . At 22 he was a master mariner . His first command was a brigantine , which he sailed to Tahiti . He spent the war as an OSS officer operating with the partisans in Yugoslavia rather than on the Warner Brothers lot . And periodically , to prove that he was sincere , - he ran away from Hollywood . <P> Hayden tells his story with honesty , humor and considerably more literary flair than is summoned by the ghostly hacks who write most Hollywood memoirs . He was one of the last beneficiaries and victims of the star-building system that died with television , and he describes the system 's absurdities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hollywood 's effect on Hayden was curious : whereas most leading men ( Flynn , Bogart , Wayne ) began after a time to believe their own roistering publicity , Hayden found himself beginning to disbelieve in everything he had ever done . <P> Jump Ahead . Son of a New Jersey advertising salesman , Hayden caught his first glimpse of the sea in Boothbay Harbor , Maine , where his mother and stepfather had fled a jump ahead of the creditors . Before long he was slipping down to the Gloucester and Boston docks to beg a berth on the beam trawlers . By the time he got his skipper 's papers , he was something of a local hero ( LOCAL SAILOR LIKE MOVIE IDOL headlined the Boston Post ) . A well-meaning friend sent a letter to a Hollywood agent : " There 's a young fellow back here named Hayden . He is twenty-four years old , six feet four inches tall , weighs 220 . . . " <P> Nobody fooled himself that Hayden could act . Week after week he sat idly around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weights in the studio gymnasium . Finaly he was given the second male lead , Behind Fred MacMurray and opposite Madeleine Carroll ( whom he later married ) in Virginia , and the big publicity boom was on . <P> But he was restless , and although paramount promised him an $18,000 schooner to keep him happy , he wiggled out of his contract to go off to war . When he returned , he was starred in a dreary succession of B pictures , but the pay in those last palmy days was considerably higher-upwards of $160,000 a year . <P> Off to Tahiti . It only made Hayden more restless . He lived on and off boats , consulted a psychiatrist and watched his career slide . He describes how he was asked to play Tarzan by a zealous producer who had heard he had a flaming desire to save the world : " Maybe you do n't realize that Tarzan represents the free man who stands alone against the forces of evil . Perhaps you could strip to the waist . . . " The troubled Hayden returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in defiance of a court order , taking off with them for Tahiti . <P>
