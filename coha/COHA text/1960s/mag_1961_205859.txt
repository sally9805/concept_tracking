During the swearing-in ceremonies in the Senate , Lyndon Baines Johnson , as the duly elected Senator from Texas , went through the formality of taking the oath of office . Moments later , as the duly elected Vice President of the U.S. , he listened as the clerk read his resignation from the Senate . Johnson made a hand-washing gesture , watched patronizingly while an appointed Senator , Millionaire William Blakley , was sworn in his stead , shortly walked out of the chamber to revert ( but not for long ) to the title of mister . <P> As the door to the lobby swung behind L.B.J. , his successor , Majority Leader Mike Mansfield , gathered up his papers and edged into Johnson 's front-row aisle seat . It was just about the only solid evidence of his new office that Mansfield was likely to get . In his new role , or roles , Johnson will retain and pick up more titles and perquisites than a Bourbon king . He will continue as presiding officer over the Senate Democratic caucuses and director of party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an added $40,000-a-year payroll for office help . He was surprised and right grieved to learn that 17 Senators voted against this proposal in the Democratic caucus , because they thought it was an executive invasion of the legislative branch . <P> Johnson will not only take over the Vice President 's ornate ceremonial office , just off the Marble Room , plus a roomy vice-presidential suite in the old Senate Office Building , but will retain his princely old majority leader 's office in the Capitol Building , with its gorgeous aquamarine furnishings . Mansfield graciously de cided to keep his cramped old digs on the gallery floor . <P> In addition to his constitutional duties as President of the Senate , Johnson will serve as a member of the National Security Council ( thus rating a special military aide ) , as chairman of the National Aeronautics and Space Council and the President 's Government Contracts Committee . He will attend Cabinet meetings and will cicerone the congressional leaders at their weekly strategy meetings with President Kennedy . And , not to neglect the field of foreign affairs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McNamara for briefings on the international and military situations . In Johnson 's future , according to Washington reports , will be early official trips to Brazil and Russia .
