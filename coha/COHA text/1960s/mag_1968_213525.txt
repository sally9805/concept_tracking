As far as the 90th Congress is concerned , time 's a-wastin ' . With elections only a month off , its members are desperate to get their campaigns under way . Last week , for example , the 38 members of California 's House dele gation decided to adjourn , come what may , at the end of this week . One of them explained simply : " We 've got to get home . " <P> For all that is getting done on Capitol Hill , the rest of Congress might as well do the same . When the Congress did act , all too often it was only to wield an indiscriminate axe . To win approval of his anti-inflationary 10% income tax surcharge , the President last spring agreed to a $180 billion budget ceiling . Last week the Senate refused to exempt Medicaid benefits for the poor from that ceiling , then went one step further and sliced $500 million from the $2.3 billion originally allocated to Medicaid . <P> <P> Deep as those cuts were , they were superficial compared to gouges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House irresponsibly appropriated only $1.6 billion , lowest sum in the program 's 21-year history and $1.3 billion less than President Johnson 's bare-bones request . Development loan funds were hacked from the $765 million asked for by the Administration to only $265 million . The Alliance for Progress got only $290 million of a requested $625 million , which touched off bitter complaints all over Latin America . <P> Deputy Alianza Coordinator James Fowler warned : " The kind of saving represented by the House cuts is the type that a prosperous shopkeeper in a riot zone might achieve by failing to renew his insurance policies . " Somewhat chastened , the Senate last week voted to restore $300 million of the cut foreign aid funds but the final figures must still be negotiated in a Senate-House conference . <P> Almost unnoticed , Congress quietly whacked $13.9 million from the Administration 's requested funds for educational and cultural exchanges in August , in the process virtually gutting the famed Fulbright scholar program established in 1946 . Fulbright money was reduced 72% , plummeting from $680,000 to $136,000 for Britain alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outgoing Congress was understandable . " You ca n't get blood out of a turnip , " he said , " and the 90th Congress is a turnip . " Not that the future is any more promising . " As things go , " he added , " the 91st may be a stone . "
