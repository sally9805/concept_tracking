Mahalia Jackson , 49 , says that until recently she assumed that Jerusalem was in heaven . Last week America 's great Negro Gospel singer carried her " joyful noise for the Lord " to Israel , and the effect she made on Israelis was just what it had been all spring on the audiences of her first extended European tour-mesmeric . <P> In London , Frankfurt , Stockholm , Essen admirers stomped and hollered for encores . In Hamburg she had to go back onstage in her street dress and Indian moccasins to sing two final songs . In Berlin the manager of the Sportpalast assured her that he had not heard so much audience noise since Hitler ranted there in 1938 . He seemed to prefer Mahalia . <P> Although Mahalia had always wanted to visit Israel , as the time for the concert drew near she began to worry : " I never thought about Israel not being Christian . " <P> But the 2,000 people who jammed Tel Aviv 's main auditorium last week were with her from the first song . <P> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necklace lifted her majestic contralto through My Home Over There ( " There 's gon na be peace one day ) , The Holy Bible , Ai n't Goin ' Study War No More , bending her notes in the manner of the great blues singer Bessie Smith . Occasionally , she stepped away from the microphone to let her big voice boom through the hall without the aid of electronics . When she got to Joshua Fit ae Battle of Jericho , the walls of the auditorium almost came down . Mahalia escaped only by improvising a song : Mahalia 's Not Gon na Sing No More . <P> It has been that way ever since 1947 when New Orleans-born Mahalia Jackson recorded a Gospel song called Move On Up a Little Higher for a small record company . The disk sold a whopping 2,000,000 copies , and Mahalia who had sung Gospel songs in neighborhood churches since her childhood , turned her mention from her Chicago beauty shop to push her professional career . From the start audiences recognized her , as did London 's New Statesman , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generation . The obvious sincerity of Mahalia 's belief moves audiences even when they can not understand her words . " I believe everything , " said she . " I believe Joshua did pray to God and the sun stood still " On her Israeli trip she became frightened while traveling over the twisting roads of the rugged Judean Hills , until a " Spirit " reprimanded her : " If Joseph could bring Mary over these rough mountains on a donkey , you ought a be ashamed of yourself , Mahalia . " In fact , the whole trip was like a homecoming . " The very first gospel singers , " says Mahalia Jackson were them angels who sang ' Peace on earth , good will to men . ' "
