While the President of the U.S. last week toured the Appalachian areas of poverty , bringing attention once more to the fact that unemployment as well as prosperity is a major fact in the land , statistics showed that the paradox of the employment situation is becoming even more pronounced . <P> In the past year , the thriving econ omy has generated 1,500,000 new jobs , but only 1,200,000 new workers have entered the market - thus forcing down joblessness from 5.8% of the work force to 5.4% last month . There are many parts of the nation in which the real problem is not how to find jobs , but how to find people to do all the work available . With an 8,000,000 car year ahead , Detroit expects to have 13,500 jobs going begging during the next twelve months . Farm-equipment makers are enjoying such a good year that International Harvester and John Deere are scouring the countryside for 50 miles around their Midwestern plants looking for skilled and semiskilled workers . In a Government-watched economy that is ever more conscious of bookkeeping , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prize catch , and many firms are busy raiding college campuses to pick up accounting majors , often offering $600 a month to begin . <P> The overriding factor in the unemployment situation is that virtually all jobs now being created are for the skilled and the educated ; of the 1,500,000 jobs gained in the past year , only about 400,000 went to blue-collar workers . The big gains came in the service fields , which in general require much higher education levels . This uneven situation has existed for a long time , but it has clearly become even more aggravated by prosperity . Just to hold at the present level of unemployment , the economy not only must generate at least 3,500,000 new jobs every year for the rest of the decade , but upgrade the skills of the lower segment of the work force .
