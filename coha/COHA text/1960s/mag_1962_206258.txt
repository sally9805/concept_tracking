To many Americans-both Democratic and Republican-foreign aid is a painful necessity at best , a downright giveaway at worst . This feeling has encouraged Congress to make a tradition of wielding an ax at presidential foreign aid requests . Last week , President Kennedy asked Congress to appropriate $4.9 billion for foreign aid in fiscal 1963 , the biggest aid request since Dwight Eisenhower 's $5.1 billion whopper in 1953 . Noting that it is " always open season " on foreign aid , Kennedy insisted that the sum was " vital to the interests of the U.S. " and " can not , I believe , be further reduced . " But after such customary formalities , the President made a spirited challenge aimed at softening the blows of the waiting ax , even if it can not stay them . <P> " I realize , " said the President , " that there are among us those who are weary of sustaining this continual effort to help other nations . But I would ask them to look at a map see map and recognize that many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the long twilight struggle for freedom , that others are new nations poised between order and chaos , and the rest are older nations now undergoing a turbulent transition of new expectations . Our efforts to help them help themselves are small in cost compared to our military outlays for the defense of freedom . Yet all of our armies and atoms combined will be of little avail if these nations fall . " <P> Hard Look . Louisiana 's Otto Passman , chairman of the House foreign aid appropriations subcommittee and a perennial foe of foreign aid , predictably called Kennedy 's request " preposterous , " and Kentucky 's Republican Senator Thruston Morton warned : " A lot of us who have been friends of foreign aid are going to be looking at it mighty hard this year . " Minnesota 's Republican Representative Walter Judd suggested that the U.S. should " let a few of these countries go to the Communists " so that the others will not blackmail the U.S. into giving aid by threatening that they might also do so . <P> At his press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sometimes , he said , those who " want to put the ax to foreign aid hardest are the ones who make the most vigorous speeches against Communism and call for a policy of victory . " Anyone not interested in the fight against Communism , added Kennedy , should go ahead and cut the bill . <P> The Congress will almost certainly do just that , probably by the 15% to 20% that it usually lops off aid bills . But Kennedy 's hope is to stave off deeper cuts in the face of general congressional weariness with foreign aid . To assuage the aid program 's critics , he pointed out that the Administration 's new aid program began only four months ago and has not had time to operate perfectly . Though he is sending a whole battery of top lieutenants to preach the new program 's virtues to Congress , the chief job of making reforms and selling them to Congress falls on Fowler Hamilton , 50 , a Wall Street lawyer who took over last fall as boss of the renamed Agency for International Development , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
