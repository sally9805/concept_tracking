" Put your hands to work and your hearts to God " was the maxim enjoined upon that curious Protestant sect known as the Shakers by their founder , Mother Ann Lee . An English mill-hand , Mother Ann founded the Shaker religion after having experienced her own mystical vision of the Second Coming ( she somehow got the notion that she was He ) . Together with a handful of converts , Mother Ann emigrated to the U.S. in 1774 . <P> By the 1860s , some 6,000 Shakers were living in 18 communities scattered from New England to Indiana . Today the sect is virtually extinct , since Mother Ann regarded sex as a device of the devil and Shaker " brothers " and " sisters " lived in separate dormitories . Their only mutual recreation was prayer meetings , at which they sang hymns and " shook " together in frenzied dances that must have looked like Saturday night at the Electric Circus . <P> Fortunately , in everything except babies , early Shaker craftsmen were astonishingly productive . They invented a flat broom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor-saving devices . Even now , their spare yet elegant furniture and utensils seem so modern that they are sought after and copied by architects and designers . Shaker villages were oases of austere grace and functionalism . " Wherever you go , you feel that you are beyond the realm of hurry , " wrote one visitor in 1877 . " There is no restlessness , or fret of business , or anxiety ; it is as if the work was done , and it was one eternal afternoon . " <P> Dairy in the Round . This week , over the Fourth of July , thousands of Americans will visit the two remaining active Shaker communities-near Portland , Me. , and Canterbury , N.H.-as well as others in Pleasant Hill , Ky. , Old Chatham , N.Y. , and Hancock , Mass. , where original Shaker buildings have been converted into museums . There they can buy Shaker jams , inspect Shaker houses , recapture a whiff of that eternal Shaker afternoon . <P> The restored village at Hancock , Mass. , is currently the most fascinating of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Round Stone Barn . Built in 1825 , the barn was widely cited during the 1880s as " machinelike in its efficiency " and " a model for the soundest dairying practices . " Settlers on the Great Plains dotted the Western frontier with timber versions of it-most of which have now rotted away . By the time the Hancock village was taken over by the Berkshires ' Shaker Community , Inc. in 1960 , huge cracks had appeared in the Shaker barn 's walls and the interior had fallen into ruin . Refurbished with the aid of nearly $500,000 from Frederick W. Beinecke , S. &; H. trading-stamp executive , plus construction materials donated at cost by the George A. Fuller Co. , the barn will be featured , in photographs , as part of a display in the U.S. pavilion at Osaka 's 1970 world 's fair . <P> Three Levels . The barn 's design displays a canny combination of the practical and the monumental . Constructed of wood and stone within a 270-ft. circumference , it ranged cows and horses facing into a central core . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could enter by a separate driveway that led to the level above the stalls , then drive around the circle , distributing feed in the hayloft . A manure pit beneath the stable level permitted cow dung to fall through trapdoors and be easily carted away .
