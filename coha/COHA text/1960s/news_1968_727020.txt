txt Legislative leaders indicated today that they were looking for enough cuts and economy devices in Governor Rockefeller 's proposed ** budget to be able to scrap completely his proposal for a 20 per cent surcharge on the state income tax . The leaders of both the Republican-controlled Senate.band the Democratic-dominated Assembly disclosed separately that they hoped to ' come up with reductions that would go far beyond the $141-million in savings announced by the Legislature 's fiscal copmittets yesterday . Many legislators , however , indicated that they felt there was not much more that ' could be trimmed from the budget . Senate Majority Leader Earl W. Brydges and Assembly Speaker Anthony J. Travia indicated they were seeking to cut by at least half the $494-million package of tax increases the Governor has asked in order to balance his state budget for 1968-69 . Both sides gave indications that the goal was to eliminate entirely the keystone of the Governor 's tax package  --  the 20 per cent income-tax surcharge . Since this tax is estimated to yield $270-million in the first fiscal year , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . the budget . However , alternative proposals were also being discussed . One of them would keep part of the surcharge and use at least some of the savings to eliminate the Rockefeller proposals for a 1-cent-agallon rise in the gasoline tax and a 10-cents-a-fifth increase in the liquor tax . The first-year yields of these two taxes are estimated at $21-million and $15-million , respectively . There seemed to be no inclination to do any major surgery on the other key part of the tax package  --  a $182-million increase in business levies . Whether the leaders would be able to go beyond the $141-million in savings announced yesterday remained uncertain . The prime unknown factor is the Governor , who has been uncharacteristically absent from Albany during the last two days of budget-cutting negotiations . Mr. Rockefeller who has been vacationing with his family in Puerto Rico , will return to Albany tomorrow morning . Yesterday , through Lieut . Gov . Malcolm Wilson , he sent a message to the Legislature urging it to " take into consideration " some $93-million in extra state spending that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Governor 's move was interpreted as a last-ditch attempt to persuade the legislators to leave his tax package intact . Mr. Rockefeller is expected to press that view on the Legislative leaders when he returns to Albany . His success or failure will probably depend on how adamant the lawmakers , particularly the Republicans , are about slashing the tax package to its lowest possible point . This being an election year , the legislators are more than normally reluctant ? to vote for new taxes and possibly invite retaliation at the polls by the electorate . Senator Brydges , held the second no-decision conference in as many days with his party colleagues on the fiscal committees ' proposal for $141-million in tax reductions . Mr. Brydges , who is being pressed hard for more drastic budget-pruning by a bloc of fiscal conservatives , told newsmen that the Republican Senators " still want to explore the possibility " of additional cuts . The only thing the Republicans agreed on today , the Senate leader said , was to send the budget bills to the printer as amended by the $141-million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily be amended again if further slashes were agreed upon . Mr. Brydges scheduled another Republican conference for tomorrow morning . A few minutes after the Republican leader held his chat with newsmen , the Legislature 's ranking Democrat , Assembly Speaker Travia , told newsmen that he had " come up with something " that might make it possible for the Legislature to completely drop the Rockefeller . proposal for a 20 per ceilt come tax surcharge . Mr. Travia declined to provide any details of his plan immediately , saying that he was still studying its ramifications and would probably not make a decision until tomorrow . But he indicated that it involved putting off certain state payments during the next fiscal ' year to make more cash available for the budget . All signs today pointed to the likelihood that the Legislature would go right down to the constitutional time deadline , or possibly past it , before passing a budget . The deadline , which neither of the leaders - viewed as an emergency , is April 1 ( next Monday ) , which is the start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days away . Mr. Brydges said he would " bend every effort ? to pass a budget in the Senate by Saturday night . " But Mr. Travia told a closed conference of his Assembly Democrats this evening that he would not keep them in session all week waiting for the Senate to act . He said he did not expect to bring the budget to a vote in his house until next Monday , at the Both leaders said they saw no serious problem about going past the deadline , at least not until April 10 , the first payday for state employes in the new fiscal year .
