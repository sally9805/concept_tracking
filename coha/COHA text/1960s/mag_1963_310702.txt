The deluge of advertising that floods the mails - and never seems so insist ent as during the holiday season - some times infuriates by its bulk as much as it influences by its appeal . Each year the public is hit by an onslaught of 48 billion direct-mail ads , and the business of compiling mailing lists has become a highly automated industry made up of dozens of firms that spare no effort to capture another name . This year they will gross close to $1 billion renting names and addresses to anyone who has anything to sell . Lists can be rented with the names of 221,782 doctors , 2,476 patent lawyers , 18 safety-pin makers , 41 zoos , Cadillac owners and every American named Murphy ( 50,000 ) . On the average , each mailing nets less than a 2% response , but that is enough to pro duce $30 billion in mail sales . <P> Virtually every adult American can figure that he is on at least 20 different lists , from mail-order houses to the phone company . The cycle starts before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off hospital personnel for the names of expectant mothers that they can sell to diaper-service companies and baby photographers . The child joins a list in his own right the first time he sends in a cereal box top , makes it again at high-school graduation when his name is gleaned from a yearbook or supplied by a cap-and-gown manufacturer . From then on , every time he registers his car , makes the telephone directory , buys a home , rents an apartment , joins a book club , contributes to a charity , shops by mail or takes out a credit card , his name is apt to be noted by some listmaker . No matter how much he may regret it , his name is a marketable commodity , rented for 2 to 3 each time it is used . <P> Tidy Income . Companies that accumulate lists fall into two clear-cut categories . One is made up of firms that produce lists as a by-product of their regular business-magazines , gift houses , professional associations , book and record clubs , credit-card firms , charities . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year for an active list of 1,000,000 names ) by renting them out through some 30 U.S. list brokers . Industry sources estimate that the Diners Club makes more than $350,000 a year circulating its members ' names . <P> In the other category are firms that diligently compile lists to rent . The largest by far is Detroit 's R. L. Polk &; Co. , which can supply up to 120 million names broken down into hundreds of categories . Polk works mostly from names it collects from state automobile registration certificates , can supply addresses of all Ford owners in Texas , including those who have bought a car within 40 days . Reuben H. Donnelley Corp . also works with auto registrations , in addition has a list of 55 million addresses without names , making possible broadside mailings to just about every " Occupant " in well-populated areas .
