The dancers swirled and swooped through Peking 's newest ballet one night last week , giving it every ounce of Mao-think that their agile heels could kick up . For who should be out front for a command performance of " China 's new tradition of revolutionary modern ballet " than Mao Tse-tung himself , along with his wife Chiang Ching , Defense Minister and Heir Apparent Lin Piao , Premier and No. 3 Man Chou Enlai , Cultural Revolution Chief Chen Pota and Top Ideologist Kang Sheng . It was the first public appearance of Mao and his Politburo faithful in five months , and the final chorus of the ballet reflected the mood of the outing : <P> The sun has risen , <P> The sun has risen , <P> The sun is Mao Tse-tung . <P> Decibels to Fists . Much of China , however , is dancing to a different time . Two days after Mao 's night at the ballet , thousands of students and workers representing rival groups in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution massed outside a Peking department store and fought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decibels finally gave way to fists and bloody clashes . Peking wall posters reported fierce battles elsewhere . According to one edition , the deputy military commander in western China 's Chinghai province overthrew his pro-Maoist commander and killed or injured more than 200 Maoist supporters . <P> In the neighboring province of Kansu , some 100,000 anti-Maoists reportedly stormed a Red Guard-run newspaper , and were joined by eight truckloads of army troops ; in the melee that ensued , several hundred people were said to have been killed or wounded . In Szechwan province , anti-Maoist " reactionaries " were reported to have shot and seriously wounded the deputy commander of the military district . Whether or not the wall-posters were accurate , the tales of strife indicated that there was still much opposition to Mao 's cultural revolution . <P> For all their internal violence , the Chinese still had plenty of steam left over for their outside enemies . After Indonesia expelled Red China 's two top diplomats in Djakarta for triggering an anti-Chinese demonstration , Red China in turn booted Indonesia 's two top diplomats out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of the Indonesian embassy , waving placards and threatening trouble . Toward week 's end , more than 100,000 marched to Peking 's Workers Stadium and whooped up an anti-Indonesian rally for TV and radio listeners . <P> Tough Cop . To try to consolidate control of his rampant revolution , Mao is creating municipal and provincial " revolutionary committees " that combine loyal government workers , Red Guards and military leaders and replace the former party and government apparatus that was often as not filled with anti-Maoist elements . So far , the committees have been set up in Peking , Shanghai and four provinces . It was indicative of the task they face that the head of the Peking Committee , in effect the city 's governor general , is a tough cop : Hsieh Fuchih , 69 , Minister of Public Security and thus the nation 's civilian and military police chief .
