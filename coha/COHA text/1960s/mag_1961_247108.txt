Aboard the Japanese freighter Oshima Maru , which left Yokohama last week , were two stone garden lanterns on their way to Hyannisport , Mass . The lanterns - one a three-ton , nine-foot model called kasuga , the other a one-ton , four-footer called yukimi ( " snow-viewing " lantern ) - are a present for President Kennedy from Professor Gunji Honoso , silver-haired international law expert at Tokyo 's Aoyama Gakuin University , who got to know the President back in the days when Kennedy was a junketing Senator . Cost of both lanterns : $1,250 . <P> Stone lanterns , part of the current boom in all things Japanese , are popping up like granite mushrooms in thousands of U.S. gardens , patios and motel parking areas . The average small lantern , standing three feet high , costs only about $100 , including crating and handling . So great is the demand that Japanese stonemasons , a traditionally unhurried lot and given to meditative puffs on bamboo pipes between mallet whacks , have a tremendous backlog of orders piling up . Japan is exporting an average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. Many U.S. tourists buy them at Ishikatsu , Tokyo 's largest masonry shop , and have them shipped home . <P> Good lanterns , say Japanese landscape gardeners , must have a " built-in " feel of age , restraint , and a special beauty known as shibui . Placing one in a garden is a matter of the most delicate importance : it must stand beside a pond or brook , where its reflection will be seen by garden strollers " at exactly the right moments and in the right angles . " One problem facing Professor Honoso , who arrives at Hyannisport early next month to personally supervise the installation of the gift lanterns : the Kennedy compound has neither ponds nor brooks .
