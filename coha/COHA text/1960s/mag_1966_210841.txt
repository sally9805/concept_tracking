Businessmen today readily recognize that a good university executive may have the makings of a topflight corporation officer-and universities likewise know that a learned business leader may be just the man to head up a college .

Etherington , however , says that he has always been interested in education , and sees no radical discontinuity between investment and learning . He left law practice to join the exchange in the firm belief that its " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Education , he adds , is simply the highest type of service .
