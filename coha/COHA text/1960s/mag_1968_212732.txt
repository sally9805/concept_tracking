Make-Believe Alexander Pope must have been wrong , poor chap . The proper study of mankind is not man , but-in current fiction , at any rate-his phallus . Novelists are exploring ever more intimately , not to say enviously , the wondrous achievements of recognized bedroom supermen . In fact , everyone-heroes , authors , readers-seems to be getting rather exhausted . Perhaps that is why so many novels this season deal with sex in its most mechanized and dehumanized form . The dildo is the feature ; everybody , apparently , uses an artificial penis , or else needs one badly . <P> Gore Vidal 's Myra Breckinridge ( TIME , Feb. 16 ) depicts a transvestite who tries to make it both as a man and as a woman , and winds up no woman at all and only half a man . Three other new novels share with Myra her/his/its preoccupation-or experimentation-with artificial sex . But unlike Myra , which is redeemed somewhat by Vidal 's satirical skill , these books have the lifeless neutrality of assignments thought up by publishers ' accountants and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to exalt , amuse , enrage , inform , misinform or anesthetize ; they also fall short of truly satisfying grubbiness . <P> Venus Examined , by Robert Kyle ( 345 pages ; Bernard Geis ; $5.95 ) , and The Experiment , by Patrick Skene Catling ( 317 pages ; Trident Press ; $5.95 ) , give the reader the astonishingly vivid impression that he is listening to sex manuals being read aloud to the thousand strings of Mantovani . Both start with almost identical premises , suggested no doubt by the success of the Kinseyesque novel The Chapman Report and the Masters-Johnson scientific study Human Sexual Response . <P> Venus Examined assumes that a small , sleazy charitable foundation attempts to grab status in the world of tax-exempt altruism by sponsoring a sex research project . The researcher is bent on filming the orgasm in its natural habitat , using live volunteers and , among other teaching aids , a camera-equipped mechanical phallus . Experiment places its research project , supplied with similar equipment , in a crummy Ohio college . Faculty wives are among the volunteers . Neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sentence by sentence , although Catling wins the nomination for the silliest line of the year ( so far ) : " Camilla 's cheeks prettily pinkened . " <P> The Deal , by G. William Marshall ( 511 pages ; Bartholomew House ; $6.95 ) is notable , by contrast , for its more traditional approach . No new-fangled gadgets here ; just the plain , old-fashioned dildo . That is understandable , since the plot is a plain , old-fashioned story about the raunchy movie world . The hero is " the Baron , " Hollywood 's No. 1 superstar . He has a " tremendous problem . " He is forever being " laughed out of bedrooms , " so he asks the boys over an makeup to fashion a substitute artifact for him . He kills a girl with it . <P> Perhaps the most interesting fact about this limpid novel is that the author is Ginger Rogers ' current husband . " The sordid realism of this book , " he warns leeringly in the foreword , " may generate a feeling of shock . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
