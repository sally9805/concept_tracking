txt The Navy is worried about its image , so much so that it is considering hiring a civilian public relations concern to help it do something about it . " Not to do our public relations job for us , " a Navy public information officer emphasized testily , " but to help us study our problems and advise us on what we could do . " The problems , he pointed out , center chiefly on " the image of the Navy " in the mind of the general public and the consequent difficulty in recruiting new men and retaining the men 1 ' ' already in uniform . For the first time since the Korean . War , the Navy and its Marine Corps have had to resort to the draft in recent months in order to maintain their personnel strength . Secretary of the Navy Paul H. Nitze confided some of the Navy 's problems to a gathering of retired admirals and Marine Corps generals at the Shoreham Hotel here this afternoon . " He said there were two areas of primary concern ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the influence of sea power in world affairs . " " You can tell they 're worried , " a retired admiral in the audience commented . " This is the first time I ever heard anyone in the Navy say the ' influence of sea power in world affairs ' was second to anything . " Mr. Nitze said that there was a " definite correlation " between the Navy 's image and its influence . " It has become apparent that what we are accomplishing is not getting fully across to the public , " he declared . Survey Cited Mr. Nitze quoted the conclusion of a recent Navy survey , part of a study on naval personnel problems : " ' There is no question that the Navy is not getting credit for its splendid performance in military situations now and in recent years . ' " The Secretary observed somewhat sadly that the Navy 's image was ' outdated . He asserted that one famous Navy slogan had " come back to haunt us . " The slogan , " join the Navy and see the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with permission of the illustrated by pictures , suggests " happy-go-lucky sailors who spend most of their time on ' liberty , with relatively little ' discipline and doing little Work , " he said . In blunter language , a Navy officer later said that authorities were worried by the impression often given of drunken sailors who are carousing on liberty with no compensating " image " of the men who hold down difficult and dangerous responsibilities in warplanes and on warships . The image . Mr. Nitze declared , " has been fortified by motion pictures with Navy background in which Hollywood scriptwriters have capicopyright owner . Further reproducti talized on this character profile . " Movies and television , he said , have " led people to live in the past with naval forces of World War II vintage . " Mr. Nitze cited the motion , pictures " In Harm 's Way , " " PT 109 " and " Now Hear This ! " " Broadside " and " The Wackiest Ship in the Army " to show that scenarios of the Navy all had World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the Secretary said , " that only the latter production has Navy and Department of Defense cooperation . " " The Navy has every reason to be proud of the role it played in World War II , but , although jealous of its traditions , it is not living in the past , he insisted . " Times have changed and we have a much different Navy than we had in September 1945 . " Mr. Nitze emphasized the role of the Navy in delivering 98 per cent of the men and cargo needed for United States forces in Vietnam , its role and that of the Marines in actual combat there , and , especially , the role of the Polaris missile submarine in American global strategic power . A Navy spokesman emphasized that the service 's public relations would not be turned over to a private concern but that consideration was being given to obtaining additional professional advice . The Air Force and the Army customarily hire advertising agencies to handle recruiting programs . The Navy handles its own recruiting advertising . Five years ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and recommend ways of improving the public attitude toward that service .
