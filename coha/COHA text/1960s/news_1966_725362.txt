txt Washington , Feb. 24 ? United States officials said here today that the administration 's plans are to call up the reserves only if the war in southeast Asia spreads beyond Viet Nam . They said they wanted to clear up what they described as a misinterpretation of remarks made by Defense Secretary Robert S. yesterday in testimony before two Senate committees . It was widely reported at that time , that.qzmcq#Namara said a callup of the reserves would be needed if . the Communists ' escalated the war in South Viet Nam . - What He Really Said What said was : , " Altho the President has repeatedly stated that the United , States has no desire to widen the war in southeast Asia , we can not preclude the possibility that our opponents will nevertheless choose to do so . Such a contingency would necessitate at least a . partial Mobilization , including the callup , of some or all of our reserve forces and the extension ? . of , active . duty . lours . " The officials said tke key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word widen instead of escalate , and the fact that it followed immediately after a sub-head in the copy of his testimony reading " other far east contingencies .

They would not speculate on what countries the war might spread to , but they conceded that Thailand has often been mentioned , even by the R e d Chinese , as the next target for communist aggression . The spokesman also made it clear that further buildups of United States forces in Viet Nam will be necessary as long as the Communists continue to increase their forces there . They said we have no choice but to do this and expressed amazement that some administration critics do n't understand why . The officials said their logic Is as'follows : With the addition of every communist soldier that is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nam becomes that much weaker . And if the Communists are not interested in negotiating a settlement now , when we are stronger than we have ever been before in Viet Nam , they certainly wo n't be interested when we are relatively weaker . The officials said that our military position in Viet Nam is better now than it was six months or a year ago . They said that the rapid buildup of forces there last summer frustrated the Reds ' plans for an offensive designed to overthrow the country . Call Reds Off Balance They said that while the Communists have n't given up their plans and have been continuing to build up their troop force by infiltration from the north , major allied operations in the last 60 days have kept them off balance and destroyed at least part of their capability for mounting such an offensive . They also said that there are no plans for a major change in the command structure of American forces in Viet Nam . This was in response to a question about reports that Gen.
