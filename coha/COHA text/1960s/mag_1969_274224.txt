The two Palestinian guerrillas who forced down TWA Flight 840 in Damascus may well have pulled off much more than the 46th reported hijacking of the year . The ease with which they commandeered the plane and the apparent immunity that they enjoyed in Syria suggest that air piracy is becoming a standard and almost absurdly routine tactic . The chilling fact is that no country or airline anywhere can feel safe from a group that wants a dramatic way to publicize its grievances . <P> In the case of TWA 840 , most activity focused on freeing two Israeli passengers who were detained in Damascus . The U.S. brought diplomatic pressure on Syria , and TWA President F. C. Wiser Jr . personally flew to Damascus . The most dramatic gesture came from Ola Forsberg , president of the International Federation of Airline Pilots Associations , whose 44,000 members fly for nearly all of the non-Communist world 's airlines . Unless the Israelis were freed , Forsberg promised to call , with two weeks ' notice , a 24-hour global strike . There is some question whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U Thant , who met with the pilots at week 's end , complained that " such a step would not produce the desired result . " <P> What steps can possibly be taken to end the hijackings before they result in a major disaster ? One useful measure may be the International Civil Aviation Organization 's 1963 Tokyo Convention , which was ratified by the U.S. only last week , and will go into effect this fall . The convention calls for the prompt return of hijacked airliners and passengers . Most airline officials would like to strengthen the agreement by providing for the extradition and severe punishment of hijackers as a matter of course . Even so , any country can get around extradition by granting hijackers " political asylum " - as Cuba has done regularly . Only last week , hijackers bound for Castro 's island boldly seized two Ecuadorian military transports on a flight out of Quito . When one crewman put up a fight they shot him dead . <P> Ultimately , there is no sure solution for the simple reason that , like almost everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flying at 30,000 ft. is highly vulnerable .
