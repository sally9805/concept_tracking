" There was a large laceration of his scalp and injury to his brain , " reported Surgeon James C. Drye of Louisville . " His right lung was torn and there was a fair amount of blood in his chest . His spleen was ruptured and bleeding . There were about three quarts of blood in his abdomen . His left leg was almost amputated . His pelvis was fractured . He was not hit by an artillery shell in Viet Nam , as one might think from the extent of his injuries . He was wounded while riding a motorbike on the streets of our community . " <P> The same sort of report , published by the American College of Surgeons , could have come from any city in the country . The number of motorcycles and motor scooters on U.S. roads has doubled in three years to a current total of more than 1,250,000 . Sales are still accelerating , and the number of accidents is mounting faster than the number of vehicles . Deaths increased from 882 in 1963 to 1,118 in 1964 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1,900 this year . The fatality rate for cycle riders and their " buddy seat " pals is five times that of automobile occupants . <P> Leather Is Best . The major reason for the recent increase , says Robert O'Donnell of the Greater New York Safety Council , is the inexperience of new motorcycle owners . " The pro in cycling wears durable clothing , such as leathers , and a proper helmet , and never has bare arms or legs . He knows how to handle his machine-in contrast with the put-put crowd in the go-go set . The most serious accidents happen to these people , who are not sufficiently skilled and drive around without proper equipment . " <P> Motorcycle injuries have become so numerous that emergency-room doctors and trauma surgeons now rate them as epidemic , and they are , on the average , far more devastating than those that result from car crashes . " If you have your seat belt fastened and drive into a stone wall at 15 m.p.h. , " says O'Donnell , " the car will be a mess but there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do that on a motorcycle , you get thrown against the brick wall , which is ruinous to flesh and bone . " Since the rider is usually projected headfirst , like a missile , says Manhattan 's Dr. Robert H. Kennedy , the most severe and common injuries , those that cause 70% of the deaths , are to the head . A properly designed helmet is essential for cycle safety , but many riders wear inadequate helmets or none at all . Nonfatal head injuries have caused countless cases of disfigurement , paralysis and blindness . Crippling from loss or mutilation of arms and legs is common . <P> California , which leads the nation with 250,000 registered cycles , compiled a grisly record in 1965 with 263 fatal accidents ( some involving more than one death ) for motorcycles and 13 for scooters . Ironically , the accident rate is lower on California 's roaring freeways than at the low speeds of snaking mountain roads or intersections of Los Angeles ' labyrinthine streets . In New York City , the very density of traffic slows cycles to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pavements are even worse on two wheels than on four : San Francisco makes its motorcycle cops dismount and climb into cars when it rains .
