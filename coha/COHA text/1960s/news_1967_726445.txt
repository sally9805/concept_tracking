txt Nearly . complete returns from the first month : of the New York State lottery indicate that sales were only about one-quarter of what the state had predicted . A survey of the nine regional banks for the lottery showed yesterday that about seven million , or possibly less , of the $1 tickets were sold in June . The state had predicted a sale of $30-million a month , or $360-million a year , and had based its 1967.68 school-aid budget on this forecast . All profits from the lottery are to go for education . The biggest loser , if the lottery continues to falter , will be New York City , which is supposed to receive $72-million extra in state school aid from the lottery . The lottery 's failure . to live up to ? expectations could thus push . both the ? city and the state " CloSef ' to seeking tax increases next year  --  a year // whed all state legislators are up for re-election and therefore reluctant to pass new taws . The State Tax Department , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yesterday , except to acknowledge they were ' off . " Tax Commissioner Joseph H. Murphy contended that the figures received so far from the regional banks were incomplete and possibly misleading . He said he would make public " the final audited figures " as soon as they were available , possibly next week . Officials at almost all the regional banks , however , said the figures they gave out yesterday were either final or close to final , with perhaps a handful of lottery outlets still to report . The tickets are being sold in about 4,000 banks , hotels and ' motels around the state ; they are also available at a few local government offices and at the harness-racing tracks . The regional bank for New York City , the Chemical Bank New York Trust Company , declined to release the sales figures for the city , saying that it was up to the Tax Department to make them public , if it chose to .

The eight regional banks covering the rest of the state reported total sales of about 2.2 million tickets . One upstate bank official , who asked to remain unidentified , noted that his region had been allotted 1.2 million tickets and had sold only slightly over 100,000 . " Do you know anybody that can use a million unused tickets ? " he said . " Maybe we cat have one hell of a bonfire . " One apparent reason for the lottery 's poor performance is the lack of a vigorous advertising campaign . Because of Federal laws that keep lottery advertising off the air and out of magazines and most newspapers , the state is limited generally to highway billboards and posters in buses , subways , commuter railroad stations and the outlets themselves . " There 's no question , " Com ' - missioner Murphy said recently , " that our promotional efforts are so sever. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , get the word around . " The Tax Department allotted $1.5-million to its billboard and advertising campaign . The lottery 's slump will have no effect on the size of the monthly prizes . There will still be 240 prizes for every million tickets sold , ranging from ' $150 up to $100,000 . A yearly superprize of $250,000 will also be awarded at the end of the state fiscal year , March 31 . The ' first monthly drawing will be held in three stages , starting in Albany on July 20 and ending in New York City on July 24 and July 26 . The pattern for all the monthly lotteries is expected to be the same , with the prize-drawing for the July lottery . Lottery Official Appointed ALBANY , July ? State Tax Commissioner Joseph H.
