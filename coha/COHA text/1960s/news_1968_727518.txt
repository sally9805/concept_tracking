txt Until the recent coal-mine disaster near Farmington , W. Va. , the United Mine Workers , the mining industry , and the federal government seemed resigned to an almost fatalistic position  --  Ahat danger is inherent in mine jobs and that not too much can be done about it . That has changed now . The mine workers now plan to press on Capitol Hill and in coal-state capitals for new safety measures and bigger appropriations for mine inspections and enforcement actions . A mine-safety bill sent to Congress by President Johnson last September , and en- dorsed by the UMW , got nowhere on the Hill . Industry opposed changes , contending that amendments to the Coal Mine Safety Act of 1952 are unnecessary , that the industry is making progress toward more safety in mining , and that better enforcement of the present law is all that is necessary . Pressure building up The arguments against an amended law  --  perhaps an entirely new law  --  wo n't be as effective in 1969 . Sentiment is already build-Mg up for legislative changes . Although the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revisions , it is among the quickest to say now that new legislative moves will be hard to stop . The mine union is in a somewhat ambiguous position . To many miners , it must share the blame for the lack of tighter safety laws , although it has argued for them . For years , the UMW has encouraged mine mechanization , at the cost of jobs , provided the coal industry shared its gains with the miners continuing to work and , through pensions and other benefits , eased the lives of // Coal miners seek more safety action . // those displaced . Mine productivity has climbed : the UMW recently reported that the average United States mine " has tripled production in the past 20 years  --  from 6.3 to 18.5 tons a day . " The miners ' share in profits from this gain includes weekly pay that for many now tops 8200 , plus pension , vacation bonus , hospitalization , and other benefits . Miners now think of their jobs , once grubby and drudgery , as good industrial jobs . They concede @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they fare better in material ways than workers in most other industries . Adjustments resisted Most find it hard to accept the adjust . ments necessary to take jobs with new skill requirements in other , less-forbidding industries  --  adjustments that for most would include moving from coalfield homes to a life in a much different , more competitive social environment . Fifty-one years ago , coal-mine fatalities set a record as 3,240 miners were lost in coalfield accidents , 362 of them in a single mine disaster on Dec. 6 at Monongah , W. Va . Over the last half-century , nearly 85,000 men have been lost in various types of mine mishaps . Those grim figures make coal mining the most hazardous industry in the country , and new statistics add to that reputation every month of every year . The recent tragedy at Consolidation Coal Company 's mine near Farmington , W.Va. , in which 78 miners were lost , was only a dramatic , headlinemaking emphasis of a bad situation : In the first eight months of this year , before that accident , there were 159 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In August alone , there were 29 fatalities in five states . Miners recognize the peril in which they work . So far this year , one man has been lost for every 1,000 working . That 's a rate comparable to United States fatalities in a month 's fighting in Vietnam . Constant policing difficult A fatalistic , materialistic viewpoint may contribute to the miners ' hazards . Under UMW contracts , there is a union safety committee at every mine . It has the right to check for hazards , demand that management remove them , and require the closing of an unsafe area whenever it states that " an immediate danger exists . " But safety commitees seldom function effectively . A UMW official conceded at Farmington that few are more than " perfunctory , at most , " in inspections , and that this is all that mine operators will let them be or fellow miners expect them to be . Shutdowns cost production and miners ' pay  --  and mine-safety committeemen are always aware that their local can remove them at any time for " arbitrarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complain that the miners ' eagerness for high production levels  --  perhaps for bonus money , steak dinners , turkeys , or other incentives  --  tends to encourage carelessness . " Sloppy housekeeping . " it 's sometimes called . In areas of high hazard , even a slight lapse in vigilance can lead to a disaster . New resolutions provoked UMW 's president , W. A. Boyle , has been described as " some kind of a nut on safety , " particularly on the necessity of controlling coal dust and mine gases that lead to explosions . At the mine-union convention in Denver earlier this year , he was praised for his work toward a goal of ending the acceptance of coal dust as " an inherent part of the industry . " UMW 's national safety director , Lewis Evans , is confident that safer conditions are ahead . " We fought for years and years and we were like a voice crying in the wilderness , " he said recently . But eventually , the efforts paid off . " It was the agitation of the union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he added . Associated Press Wircphoto Safer in the future ? Miners in Hominy Falls , W.Va. , are shown emerging May 11 from a flooded coal-mine shaft . Such incidents are prompting the federal government , the mining industry , and miners themselves to press for new safety measures . He could have mentioned another factor : The first strong federal coal-mine-safety law , the one in effect now , has passed after a West Frankford , Ill. , disaster in 1951 which had 119 fatalities .
