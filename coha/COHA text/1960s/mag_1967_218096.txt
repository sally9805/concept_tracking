( See Cover ) <P> On the morning of Oct. 26 , 1948 , at Donora , Pa. , the skies delivered a deadly warning that man had poisoned them beyond endurance . <P> As workers trudged to their jobs , a heavy fog blanketed the bleak and grimy town . It hung suspended in the stagnant air while local businesses-steel mills , a wire factory , zinc and coke plants-continued to spew waste gases , zinc fumes , coal smoke and fly ash into the lowering darkness . The atmosphere thickened . Grime began to fall out of the smog , covering homes , sidewalks and streets with a black coating in which pedestrians and automobiles left distinct footprints and tire tracks . Within 48 hours , visibility had become so bad that residents had difficulty finding their way home . <P> Donora 's doctors were soon besieged by coughing , wheezing patients complaining of shortness of breath , running noses , smarting eyes , sore throats and nausea . During the next four days , before a heavy rain washed away the menacing shroud , 5,910 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons-and an assortment of dogs , cats and canaries-died . <P> Investigating the tragedy , meteorologists concluded that it had been triggered by a temperature inversion , an atmospheric phenomenon that prevents normal circulation of air . Ordinarily , warm air rises from the earth into the colder regions above , carrying much of man 's pollution with it . Occasionally , a layer of warmer air forms above cooler air near the ground ; the inversion acts as a lid , preventing the pollutants at lower altitudes from rising and dispersing . Inversions are no novelty , but what happened at Donora shocked public-health officials into an awareness that such layers pose a deadly threat to an increasingly industrialized and pollutant-producing society . <P> Sulky Sun . On Dec. 5 , 1952 , a thick fog began to roll over London . Hardly anyone paid any attention at first in a city long used to " pea-soupers . " But this fog was pinned down by a temperature inversion , and was steadily thickened by the soot and smoke of the coal-burning city . Within three days , the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a yard ahead . Drivers were forced to leave cars and buses to peer closely at street signs to find out where they were . Policemen strapped on respiratory masks . The Manchester Guardian reported that London 's midday sun " hung sulkily in the dirty sky with no more radiance than an unlit Chinese lantern . " <P> Hospitals were soon filled with patients suffering from acute respiratory diseases ; deaths in the city mounted . The British Committee on Air Pollution finally estimated that during the five days that the smog smothered London , there were 4,000 more deaths than would have occurred under nor mal circumstances . During the next two months , there were another 8,000 excess deaths-most of them apparently caused by respiratory disease-that scientists suspected were a direct result of the killer smog.
