Here was lust and love , birth and creation , hell and despair ; and each emotion showed not only on the faces but in every muscle of each arm and leg . The portrait busts seemed timeless , as if the sculptor knew no theme that was not eternal . The Auguste Rodin show at Manhattan 's Museum of Modern Art was near perfection-the superb work of a giant superbly installed . The public responded by joyously wallowing in the incredible vitality of bronze and stone bursting with life , of figures that writhed , embraced and entwined themselves . The critics were all superlatives , but the German poet Rainer Maria Rilke summed up the show best , though he spoke 50 years ago . " To create an image , " he said , " meant to Rodin to seek eternity in a countenance . Rodin 's conception of art was not to beautify but to separate the lasting from the transitory . " <P> To the avant-garde of 20 years ago , Rodin was an overwrought sentimentalist . The great cubist sculptor Jacques Lipchitz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruefully recalls how appalled he was when someone told him that old Rodin had liked a Lipchitz sculpture . " What could be so wrong with my little sculpture that Rodin liked it ? " he asked . But Lipchitz came to realize that though Rodin dealt with the human figure , he was breaking it down , exploring form , probing its mysteries much as the cubists were . Rodin 's Walking Man , thought to be a study for one of the six figures in The Burghers of Calais or for St. John the Baptist Preaching , seems to stride by before the viewer 's eye . Said Rodin : " The human body is a temple that marches . It is a moving architecture . " <P> It is the happy duty of the museum to stand guard over the whole history of art and to make certain that what is good is never too long neglected . To an extent , the Museum of Modern Art and its excellent catalogue have performed this service for Rodin . The show that opened last week firmly established him as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new movement to static form .
