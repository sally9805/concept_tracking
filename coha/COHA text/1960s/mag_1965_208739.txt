" This is a path-breaking venture in American journalism , " wired President Lyndon Johnson . " You have set for yourselves an important mission . " That mission is to produce the first U.S. daily devoted exclusively to news from south of the border-the Latin American Times . Now in its third week of publication , the eight-page English-language Times is reporting such stories as a survey of the new , incendiary rebel newspapers in Santo Domingo and an expos of a cloak-and-dagger U.S. Army outfit in Chile that has ruffled feathers in the U.S. embassy . " In any given day , " boasts Publisher Leonard Saffir , " the Times prints more news about Latin America than all the rest of the newspapers in the U.S. combined . " <P> Saffir concocted the idea of the paper over a drink at a United Nations cocktail party , where he met the Latin American journalist Jorge Losada , who is now the Times 's editor in chief . After 13 years as editor of the Spanish-language Latin American newsmagazine Visin , Losada was convinced that U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America , were hungry for more news from the land where their money is . And Saffir , a longtime I.N.S. foreign correspondent , who had brought out the highly profitable New York Standard during the 1963 newspaper strike , was anxious to start another paper . <P> After collecting $300,000 in backing from both U.S. and Latin American businessmen , the Times assembled a 40-man staff , opened bureaus in Washington , Miami , Mexico City and Buenos Aires . The Times became a welcome client of seven wire services , whose Latin American reporters grumble that their stories are rarely published in the U.S. press . In addition , the Times carries guest columns by persons prominent in Latin American affairs . <P> At a price of 25 a copy ( $50 a year ) in the U.S. , the paper is aimed primarily at the U.S. business community ; most of its 4,000 subscribers are businessmen in the U.S. with interests in Latin America . Latin American subscription prices range from a forbidding $100 for air-freight delivery in Buenos Aires to $75 in Bogot.     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
