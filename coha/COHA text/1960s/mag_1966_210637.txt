For sheer exclusiveness , danger and sangfroid , no sport quite matches hydroplane racing . The boats are worth upwards of a quarter of a million dollars , and there are perhaps only 20 unlimited-class hydroplane racers in the world . Last week 15% of them were wiped out in a single race . The official - and somewhat chill - reaction , from Lee Schoenith of the American Power boat Association : " I do n't think it 's go ing to have any great effect . But it sure is n't going to be the same kind of sea son for the participants . " <P> The Potomac River at Washington , D.C. , is not exactly a hydroplaner 's delight . Flowing through industrial flats and woodsy hills , on a bottom composed of two centuries of solidified human rubbish , it is often studded with beer cans , packing crates and half-submerged logs . Auxiliary coast guardsmen spent seven days policing the river before last week 's President 's Cup Regatta-knowing full well that a bit of flotsam could shatter the fragile hull of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . <P> They might have missed something . Three times a national champion , Seattle 's Ron Musson , 38 , was doing an estimated 170 m.p.h. in his rear-engined , $250,000 Miss Bardahl when he flashed past the judges ' stand on the second lap of the regatta 's second heat . In full view of 20,000 horrified spectators , Miss Bardahl clipped something in the water , sheared off a propeller blade , shot straight up into the air , fell back , and disintegrated . Less than three hours later , in the final heat , Don Wilson , 34 , in Miss Budweiser and Rex Manchester , 39 , in Notre Dame were jockeying for position on the back straightaway when Notre Dame skidded sideways and collided with Miss Budweiser , crumpling both boats instantly . All three drivers died-Musson and Manchester of broken necks , Wilson of a ruptured heart . <P> The winner ? By a grisly quirk of fate , it was the late Rex Manchester , on the basis of points scored in the first two heats .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
