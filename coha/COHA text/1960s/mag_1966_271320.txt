<P> The newest working materials for sculpture are electronic gadgets-solid-state circuits , cathode tubes , transistors and photoelectric cells . The results are intriguing thingumajigs for a technological age . The New York season has introduced two newcomers whose machines have all systems a Go-Go , invite human participation in their antics , and in return produce cacophonies akin to electronic music . <P> Madcap Circuitry . James Seawright 's spidery electronic sculptures could be Paul Klee 's fidgety drawings turned into robots . New York 's Modern Art and Whitney museums each snapped up one of the beasts from the tech stylist 's first one-man show at the Stable Gallery . " For the artist to ignore the possibilities of technology would be utter folly , " says Seawright , and he seems to have ignored few . His Watcher took 6 months to produce ; its tiny lights flicker in programmed sequences , photocell-tipped antennas bob about like tentacles , seeking the lights , and a speaker tweets and squeals to the pulsing of the circuitry . <P> Because of their photoelectric cells , Seawright 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . When Searcher beams light from its circling radarlike dishes , Scanner 's flailing arm picks up the beacon with its light sensors ; then Captive , impelled by a motor , skids and twitches about on a mirrored platform . " The machines process information , " says Seawright , 30 , an Ole Miss grad who instructs at Manhattan 's Electronic Music Center ( run by Princeton and Columbia ) . " Their cells and sensors collect information on light and sound , and they behave accordingly . My aim is to produce a kind of patterned personality . Just as a person you know very well can surprise you , so can these machines . " <P> 144-Eyed Wurlitzer . Franois Dallegret 's La Machine is a far heftier entree . A Frenchman , now designing for Montreal 's Expo 67 , Dallegret has designed a device that looks like a giant metal steeplechase hurdle , weighs half a ton , and is priced at $27,000 . It consists of two slender beams of anodized aluminum , 30 ft. long by 2 ft. high , braced between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object has all the contemplative imagery of an I beam , but it has an inner electronic life . The narrow six-inch gap between the aluminum beams is brightly lit by hidden sodium-vapor lamps that shine on electric eyes staring up through pencil-sized holes in the bottom beam . <P> When the adventurous art lover at Manhattan 's Waddell Gallery inserts his hands into the gap ( disposable plastic gloves are provided to lend a sense of formality ) , they break the light beams , thus activating eight loudspeakers that , hidden in the uprights , rumble and reverberate like a blighty Wurlitzer . Each of 144 electric eyes paired in opposing scales from high to low along the length of La Machine controls a musical tone . It was possible to pick out Fere Jacques on the gizmo ; impromptu boiler-factory blues was a far simpler tune to produce .
