txt Behind the New York City faucet is an empire six times as large as the city itself , a realm that ranges from scenic grandeur to underground settings fit for horror movies . This is the city 's watershed , where science , engineering and nature have teamed to create a world that is , in some ways , as complex and as wondrous as the metropolis into which it pours more than a billion gallons of water every day . In this watershed the city has built reservoirs in areas as big as some cities and has laid pipes that could accommodate subway trains . Here the city has embarked on vast forestation projects and compact laboratories ; created paradises for fishermen as well as sewage disposal plants . It has become an absentee owner of farmland and has built scores of miles of highway . As a weird by-product it has even become possessor of a cemetery . The watershed , built over more than 130 years at a cost of more than a billion dollars , has also made New York City one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic and educational force in many rural communities . As one of the important buyers and sellers of land in the watershed area , the city has , on many occasions , been the subject of controversy in town meetings , courtrooms and the Legislature . ' Charles Doherty , one of the key engineers in the watershed , says : " Sometimes the people in these towns treat us as though Ilwe represented a foreign power . " The opposite view is expressed by George White , editor of The Walton Reporter , a week ly in Walton , N.Y . He says : " The price that New York City has been charged for land has been pretty fair . We did n't ask the city to come here and most farmers would rather have their farms back . " Huge Extent of Area Such conflicting opinions and varied aspects of life in the watershed became apparent in a recent six-day tour of its nearly 2,000 square miles in the counties of Westchester , Dutchess , Putnam , Sullivan , Ulster , Schoharie , Delaware and Greene . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the Pennsylvania border on the west . In the 19-reservoir watershed these days , there is more optimism about the water supply conditions than in the city . Experts there say the rain in August improved the situation more than statistics indicate . Fred C. Stein , division engineer in charge of the entire upstate watershed , says. : " The rain in August restored a good deal of the ground water table . This will eventually yield a better percentage of runoff from subsequent rains . Those who see only the statistics on shortage think this is nothing . They are wrong . This is the foundation for future runoffs . " The watershed is a huge natural basin made up of three reservoir systems  --  Croton , Catskill and Delaware . Each of these systems drain many streams and the rivers into which they flow , catching and storing the water then allocating it through aqueduct and tunnel to New York City . The focal point of the watershed is at Kensico Dam , near White Plains , where the Delaware and Catskill systems meet . Within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piping and reservoir system : Schoharie , Esopus , Neversink , Rondout , East Branch and West Branch of the Delaware , Croton , Byram and Bronx River . A Main Argument The fact that water from those areas runs into the city from higher ground by force of gravity , thus cutting the cost of pumping systems , has been one of the main arguments that has made possible the westward expansion of watersheds instead of using the Hudson River as a source of the city 's supply . Another factor is the purity of the mountain streams . The appearance of the watershed today tells the story of the four years of drought more effectively than statistics or speeches . Creeks have become dry trails of polished stones , often almost obscured by tall weeds . Rivers seem to have barely enough energy to push over rocks that used to be far below the surface . But it is the huge upstate reservoirs that almost defy the imagination . The contents of Pepacton , the largest in the watershed near Margaretville , would , under normal conditions , be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With its surrounding land this reservoir , covers 20.3 square miles , two less than Manhattan Island . Today Pepacton is a wide valley through which twists a narrow , sluggish branch of the Delaware River . From the bottoni of the reservoir a hill rises about forty feet , its gray slope splotched in greenery , with two trees at the top . Ordinarily , this entire hill is under reservoir water . James Cooper , engineer in charge of the Delaware system , ran down the figures for the Pepacton dam . The capacity is 143 billion gallons , but on the day it was viewed it had 40 billions . " It looks pretty bad , does n't it ? " he observed . " But I can recall when in a single 24-hour period a rainstorm put 14 billions into the dam . " At the Canonsvilie Dam , east of Deposit , which is being constructed and is almost finished , signs in a dry valley proclaim that the area is to be flooded , a condition that seems unlikely at the moment . In Ashokan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fields have emerged where no land had been seen for years . Rowboats usually used by fishermen are so far above and beyond water they seem incongruous . The owners of the boats have just not bothered to fish in the reservoir this year . An engineer pauses to look down at the clear , but shallow Esopus Creek . " Right now we 're getting maybe 70 or 80 million gallons a day here , " he explained . " When it 's pushing 500 million a day it is two or three feet higher . " This experience of watershed men with the power of nature , and the tradition of dealing with water in terms of billions of gallons makes them wonder about the great excitement shown in New York City about a leak that may drain off as much as 100,000 gallons a day . One of them concedes , for instance that a million gallons a day may be escaping from the Catskill system . Couple of Hurricanes ' " A couple of hurricanes , " one key executive in the watershed area said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . " That is one reason that watershed men think the plan for pumping 100 million gallons a day out of the Hudson at Chelsea is unrealistic . They believe such a pumping system should be on a much bigger scale , supplying not less than 500 million gallonsa day . The opposition to the Hudson plan among watershed men is also based on bias that emerges when they show off the thickwalled structures in which are the instruments that operate the sluice gates and measure the flow of water . But it is in the dungeon-like recesses beneath the concrete floors of these buildings that the surging life of the watershed becomes more than just a dull , thudding sound or a mysterious vibration . Ashokan Reservoir , where the capacity of 128 billion gallons is now down to 60 billion , is a showpiece for water engineers who find drama in their work . There , as one walks down stone steps between gray , moist walls , the sullen , muffled roar of water is ominous . Aqueduct Explained A workman opens a heavy lock and slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What was a menacing growl suddenly becomes a roar that drowns out speech . A few steps down beyond this door is a concrete platform below which water rages , hurling itself , gray-green , against curved walls with a howl , shooting spray out on the platform as it surges into the Catskill Aqueduct . The acting engineer in charge of the Catskill system , Herbert Seiner , smiles broadly , with pride , then says , with obvious regret : " I do n't suppose the city will ever build another aqueduct into this mountain country . They 'd rather build a pumping station on the Hudson or an atomic desalting plant along the Atlantic . " A pumping station on the Hudson would require tunnels down to the city , another form of aqueduct . An aqueduct is the generic term for a tube that leads from a source of water to the distribution system . Across the field , beyond the Ashokan Reservoir , the aqueduct 's path can be traced by a rise in the ground that looks like a tunnel made by a huge mole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it goes far below the ground , crossing the Hudson 1,100 feet below sea level . To develop the watershed over more than a century , the city has had to acquire large tracts of land . At present it owns 67,850 acres on which it pays $7,481,800 in taxes . In some towns the city contributes up to three-quarters of the taxes . If such town decides to build a new school , New York City will be paying threequarters of the cost , without having any say over whether it should have been built or how it should be operated . Dispute Over Land Costs The city 's role as landowner has caused a basic disagreement about whether New York is cheated when it buys land for its reservoirs and tracts along the banks of waterways to guard against pollution . Representatives of the city are convinced the odds are against them . For prices are set by a three-man board of whom one is from the county in which the land is situated , a second from another county outside New York City and the third from . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " New York City might just as well not have a man on such a board . It 's two against one . " The city has found that it has to mark its land very carefully , in addition to putting up thousands of signs announcing that the land can not be trespassed except by fishermen who obtain permits  --  without cost ? to fish in reservoirs . On one occasion a farmer took the hay from twenty acres of city-owned land , saying he thought it was his own . Eventually , he paid $100 for the crop . As far as the water shortage is concerned , most communities in the watershed  --  outside parts of Westchester  --  are not concerned . They get their water from wells . Neighbor of Dam Complains Ironically , however , one of the strangest comments on the water shortage came from the vicinity of the Croton Dam . A. wealthy woman , who lives near the dam telephoned the city 's water employes there and complained : " Why are they draining the reservoir ? It looks terrible from the window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the drought ends and the system returns to normal . For in the four years of water shrinkage , lush mats of vegetation have sprouted where there was once water . When that growth is submerged again , it will die and make the taste of water unpleasant . According to John Kelly , one of the top engineers at Katonaih , this will require heavier dosages of copper sulphate . And even deeper in the future is the matter of the inevitable rise in the value of land owned by the city in the watersheds . As these areas go from rural to semirural to suburban , taxes on the land will rise and will have to be paid by the city .
