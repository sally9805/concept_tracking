txt Malvina Hoffman , one of the few women to reach first rank as a sculptor , died of a heart attack in her sleep yesterday morning in her studio at 157 East 35th Street , She was 81 years old . As a girl , Miss Hoffman had to fight her way into Auguste Rodin 's atelier to learn her craft . As a mature artist , she was often overwhelmed with commissions . In 1929 , she was given what probably was the largest commission ever granted any sculptor-110 bronze studies for the " Races of Mankind " exhibition at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago , 25 of them full figures , the rest busts . The commission sent Miss- Hoffman ranging around the world on arduous voyages to sketch and sculpture primitive ' peoples in their living environments . Though she lived through one of the most revolutionary eras the history of art , when experimentation and innovation were the very breath of the work of most of her contemporaries , Miss Hoffman remained true to the classical and the realistic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and abstract brass sculpture " Bird in Flight " is one of the landmark creations of 20th-century art , she said : " I wondered if it might not be a defect : in me not to have experimented more . But I was n't sufficiently impelled . " . On another occasion , she said of the work of more modernist colleagues : " Some of it . is stimulating and original . But the mass of abstract sculpture is not excellent . " Her.own work , typically , was the accurate portrait bust  --  she did , among others , Ignace Paderewski , Wendell L. Dean Virginia Gildersleeve ' of Barnard College ; Anna Pavlova , Felix M. Warburg , Ivan Mestrovic and Katharine Cornell  --  or the dramatically monumental , like the " The Sacrifice ; ' Which she cradled the.head of an armored knight in the lap of a hooded ; grieving woman , a piece destined for the War Memorial Chapel . at , Harvard University .

" Her adventures with bushmen , head hunters , the Hairy Ainu of Japan and other primitive people made excellent copy in the tabloid journals of the nineteen-thirties . She seemed to ' know what would ' make a good story and told , in interviews , of the 6-foot 8-inch man she met in North Africa who had an inferiority complex because he lived among a tribe of 7-footers , or of bushwomen with buttocks so large , that their ? babies could stand on them . Those adventures were the product of her travels for the " Races of Mankind " commission .

Her father was ' Richard Hoffman , a pianist with an international reputation , who first came here from England as accompanist . to Jenny Lind , the Swedish soprano ..

Then , armed with a letter of introduction from Borglum , she went to France to become a pupil of Rodin . Five times she went to , his studio-home in Meudon , north of Paris , and five times he refused ' to see her . Finally , Miss Hoffman told a maid she was going to stand on the doorstep until she was admitted to see the master . She got in , and then immediately won his interest by quoting from memory a sonnet by Alfred de Musset that he was trying to ' recall for a roomful of friends . She worked with Rodin for almost three years , and it was he who formed her as an artist .
