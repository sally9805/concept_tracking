As a collector and rebuilder of limp companies , California Industrialist Norton Simon owns an unrivaled record of success . From the tomato-paste base of his Hunt Foods , he has strung together an empire of two dozen corporations from publishing ( McCall Corp. ) to soft drinks ( Canada Dry ) to containers ( Knox Glass ) . Almost every company that Simon has bought into has prospered and he has hung on to all of his major acquisitions . <P> Except for one . Last week Simon conceded a resounding defeat in his effort to master steelmaking . At a loss of some $654,000 , Simon gave up 60% of his holdings in troubled Wheeling Steel Corp . and turned the job of reviving its fortunes over to Pittsburgh Steel Co . <P> For $21.50 a share , or $4.20 less than he paid , Simon sold 77,353 shares of Wheeling to Pittsburgh Steel , plus an equal amount to the family of the late Charles F. Kettering , the General Motors inventor and executive . Along with three other Simon-picked directors ( Simon himself resigned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Robert Morris announced his resignation . In as chairman and chief executive of Wheeling will go Allison R. Maxwell Jr. , 52 , a gregarious salesman who has held the same job at Pittsburgh Steel since 1956 . <P> <P> Two-and-a-half years ago , when Simon moved into Wheeling , now the nation 's tenth largest steel producer , he shook up the company by forcing five directors off the board , tossing out the chairman-president and hiring Morris away from Monsanto Chemical Co. to take charge . Amid that upheaval , Wheeling was unable to attract new seasoned steel executives . Though the company had borrowed $145 million from banks and insurance companies for plant modernization , it needed still more renovation to run efficiently . Over the past two years , Wheeling piled up losses of $12.4 million . <P> " The Constructive Way . " On top of criticism from the lenders when Wheeling failed to meet its repayment schedule last year , Simon came under pressure from his Hunt associates to devote his energies to more promising parts of his realm . To nurse Wheeling back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge because , said he , " it was the most constructive way out . " <P> The two companies should make a good fit . Pittsburgh , the nation 's 14th largest steelmaker , lacks modern galvanizing facilities that Wheeling has in quantity . Pittsburgh 's finishing capacity should help Wheeling recapture lost customers . Best of all , the two plants are linked by cheap water transport , the Ohio and Monongahela rivers . Despite his selloff , Simon kept a 4% interest in Wheeling ( 100,000 shares ) . If the price climbs eleven points from last week 's close of 21 ? , Simon could yet escape from his bath in steel with a profit .
