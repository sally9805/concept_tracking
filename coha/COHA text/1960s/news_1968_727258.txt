txt The flame of revolt and disorder is licking across the great southern arc of Communist China . Observers in Hong Kong now have been presented with overwhelming evidence of major fighting and bloodshed in the adjacent Communist Province of Kwangtung ( population 40,000,000 ) and Kwangsi ( population 23,000,000 ) . Though the evidence is somewhat less conclusive , there are persistent reports of trouble in Yunnan ( population 20,000,000 ) , which abuts North Vietnam and which is a key transportation corridor from China to Hanoi . There are also new reports , mainly from intelligence sources on Formosa , of fighting in the mainland Province of Fukien ( population 15,000,000 ) which faces it across the Formosa Strait . There are fragmentary reports of unrest // *Flames of revolt lick China // in half a dozen other Chinese provinces where Mao Tse-tung is supposed to have consolidated his rule , but where the situation is clearly far from normal . Radio reports monitored But the most graphic reports are coming from Kwangtung . Partly this is because monitored radio reports , smuggled Red Guard newspapers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in neighboring Hong Kong than information from Chinese provinces farther afield . Partly it is because Kwangtung does indeed seem to be the center of strife in southern China . ? Through Kwangtung , too , come versions of the trouble in Kwangsi where , by the admission of Communist factions actually involved , " artillery and napalm bombs " have been used . Few perplexed China watchers will quarrel with the Kwangtung newspaper Nan-Fang in its conclusion that the struggle in that province is " very acute and complex . " Pointing out that Kwangtung is " on the coastal front " and faces the British colony of Hong Kong and the Portuguese enclave of Macao , the Communist newspaper charges that Western and Chinese Nationalist agents " are constantly carrying out sabotage and making trouble " in Kwangtung . It is perhaps not entirely coincidently that Fukien , another trouble spot , faces Formosa and is thus a province particularly vulnerable to infiltration by Chinese Nationalist agents and sabotage squads . But though foreign agents may indeed be at work in southern China , it seems clear that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own frenzied ' politics . Though Kwangtung has formed its revolutionary committee , which presumes allegiance to Peking and Chairman Mao , opposition forces are still apparently strong and active . Problem spotlighted Radio and newspaper reports from pro-Mao factions contend that their followers are being " slaughtered " by supporters of disgraced President Liu Shao-chi , in league with " diehard capitalists , special agents , unreformed landlords , rich peasants , and other bad elements . " The Maoists have called on the Army to crack down on these counterrevolutionaries waging a " last-ditch struggle . " Nobody in China today , of course , openly opposes Chairman Mao , and all factions pay lip service to him . But some are clearly more loyal than others , and among factions which ostensibly follow the same supreme leader there is internecine havoc . One of the problems in the Kwangtung provincial capital of Canton , for example , is the presence of remnants of the " Kwangsi April 22 Wuchow Revolutionary Rebel Grand Army . " Wuchow is a town in Kwangsi Province west to Canton . The Rebel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and May with another force , each of them labeling the other " counterrevolutionary . " The extent of the battle now is becoming evident . Speculation noted According to one of the Rebel Grand Army 's own newspapers which has reached Hong Kong : The place where the Grand Army was stationed was razed to the ground while half of Wuchow was in ruins . Consequently , more than 2,000 buildings over an area of 380,000 square kilometers were reduced to rubble , more than 40,000 inhabitants rendered homeless , hundreds of rebel fighters loyal to Chairman Mao killed , and more than 3,000 April 22 fighters and revolutionary masses arrested , creating a serious situation in which bedrock conservatives and capitalist roaders tried to reverse previous correct decisions on them . The mass movement was suppressed , and revolutionary rebels were massacred . " Some observers are speculating that this battle , with its resulting " massacre , " is the origin of the trussed bodies which for some weeks have been washing up on the shores of Macao and Hong Kong . What does seem clear is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of the survivors fled to Canton . Now they are in trouble with opposing groups there , which are demanding that the Army run them out of town , and indeed out of the province . In Canton itself the " evil wind of violent struggle , " as one of the city 's newspapers calls it , is obviously still blowing hard . A transport workers ' publication tells of attempts by factions labeled anti-Maoist to disrupt the electricity and water supply , as well as halt public transportation . The publication says that these elements " beat up and kidnaped more than 110 of our drivers and conductors . More than 50 of our comrades sacrificed their precious lives or shed their precious blood in defense of the people 's transport , and more than 33 drivers and conductors were kidnaped and their whereabouts are still unknown . The bandits seized our people 's buses more than a hundred times . On three days last month , the publication goes on , " they seized 53 buses . They were never so mad before .
