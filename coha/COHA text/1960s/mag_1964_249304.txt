The U.S. tobacco business faces a dilemma that no huge industry has ever before confronted . The cigarette , its prime product , is increasingly under fire as a peril to life and health ; yet it continues to enjoy a king-sized market . While many of the nation 's 70 million smokers may be trying to quit , the tobacco industry has no intention of doing so . After the Surgeon General 's report , the cigarette makers last week withdrew behind a smokescreen of secrecy and agonized over the next line of defense . <P> Behind that line stands much more than tobacco . The $8 billion-a-year business affects dozens of manufacturers , 400,000 farmers , and 1,500,000 grocers , druggists and other retailers . It buys one-quarter of the nation 's foil , is the third biggest user of cellophane and one of the largest consumers of paper products . Its $250 million-a-year advertising budget helps to support the nation 's communications media-newspapers , magazines and , notably , television . Tobacco taxes earn more than $1 billion for the 50 states , more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bans . The industry is used to attacks , but the latest blast was the strongest ever because it carried the force of Government and called for " appropriate remedial action . " Congress is considering six bills that would tighten Government controls over cigarette sales , label cigarettes as injurious , or force manufacturers to list the tar and nicotine contents on their packages . The bills have little chance of passing soon , but the Federal Trade Commission figures that it already has the powers to get tough . Last week it proposed to ban advertising that makes smoking out to be manly or glamorous , and to force manufacturers to state in their ads and on their packages that cigarettes are dangerous . Some cities took independent action ; St. Louis decided to enforce an old law against smoking by minors , and Eastland , Texas , voted a dubious ban on selling or smoking cigarettes . Even more worrisome for tobaccomen is the long-range prospect that stronger Government reports and sharper public reactions can be expected later . Already three small U.S. life insurance companies have begun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sworn off smoking . <P> Well before the Surgeon General dropped his bomb , the manufacturers were employing new economic tactics . Having diversified into such things as razor blades and canned fruit punch , they are rolling out new pitches and products to keep their main business growing . Philip Morris and P. Lorillard , taking a leaf out of Raleigh 's old book , recently have begun backing some of their brands with gift coupons ( 47,185 Alpine coupons for a mink stole ) ; Liggett &; Myers recently brought out its triple-filter Lark brand . Six out of ten U.S. smokers have already switched to filters , and last week Surgeon General Luther L. Terry , pushed to amplify some confusing statements on the subject , said that filters offer " a promising avenue for future development . "
