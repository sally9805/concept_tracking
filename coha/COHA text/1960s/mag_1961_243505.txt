The Caribbean island of Hispaniola is divided into two nations-Haiti , where the politics is bad ; and the Dominican Republic , where it is worse . Over the past four years , Haiti 's President Franois Duvalier , a onetime physician , has done little to improve the lot of a country that depends on a $5,000,000 annual U.S. dole to balance its budget and whose ragged peasants still exist on a per capita income of less than $100 , lowest in the hemisphere . But he has obviously learned a great deal about how to stay in power from his neighbor , Dictator Rafael Leonidas Trujillo . <P> Last week Duvalier called the citizens of his impoverished Negro nation to the polls , ostensibly to choose a new Parliament . Duvalier , like all strongmen , thought Parliament talkative , unfriendly and obstructionist ( he eviled five members , jailed five others ) . Then he dissolved both houses and decreed the election of a single , 58-seat chamber . The only candidates who managed to get on the ballots were well-known Duvalier partisans . Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he withdrew for " personal reasons " on election eve . Voting-day squads of police spread a dragnet for anti-Duvalier Haitians , most of whom had prudently gone into hiding . Only a fraction of Haiti 's 1,000,000 voters bothered to turn out . Most of those who voted were civil servants , who had to . <P> The strongman did not run officially , but the words " Doctor Franois Duvalier-President " appeared on every ballot throughout the republic . After it was all over , Haitians learned to their surprise that they had not only elected a new Parliament but-announced Haiti 's attorney general-had also voted Duvalier a second six-year term as President .
