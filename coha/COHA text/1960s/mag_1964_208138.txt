World Without Sun . Like a giant mollusk , the two-man diving saucer glides toward its parking garage on the floor of the Red Sea . Near by lies a five-room underwater house looking like a huge plumbing joint made of chubby cylinders . Here seven pioneer oceanauts lived and worked 35 ft. below the surface for a month during the summer of 1963 . Life in and around their pelagic tank town is the subject of this eerie , colorful documentary by Jacques-Yves Cousteau , a successor to his awesome epic , The Silent World . <P> Oddly enough , the film is most absorbing when Cousteau lets his camera or his commentary dwell on the extraordinary detail of his men 's day-to-day existence .

The audience shares his fear and fascination , and occasionally even his lethargy becomes swimmingly real . It is hypnotic and hilarious to watch a school of scallops , threatened by a starfish , go snapping across the ocean bottom like a herd of stampeding dentures . The film has its faults : it grows repetitious and tries to provide variety with music full of scubadoo cuteness . Thus , by the time the saucer plunges down for a climactic survey of the queer fish and mating crabs found at the 1,000-ft. level , most viewers will be more than ready to surface , having had all the submarine miracles a landlubber can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
