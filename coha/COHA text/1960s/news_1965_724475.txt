txt President Johnson will send to Congress this week detailed blueprints for four of his programs  --  education , immigration , foreign aid and space . Eager to " get the show on the road , " as one Presidential aide put it , Mr. Johnson is speeding up his legislative proposals instead of spreading them out as originally planned . ' The President 's determination for quick action ? prompted the Senate majority leader , Mike Mansfield of Montana , to predict today that Congress would adjourn by Aug. 1 . This would be the earliest adjournment since 1956 , when Congress quit on July 27 . Congress continued in session until Oct. 3 last year , despite efforts at both the Capitol and the White House to wind up work so that the politicians could go home and campaign . " We have n't got the road- blocks facing us this year that we did last , " Senator Mansfield noted . He cited particularly the civil rights legislation that tied up the Senate during a 75-day filibuster . Senator Mansfield said he had . alerted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holdover bills to the floor by ! March 9 . These include Meas ! ores , considered last year . but ! not finally acted upon , to ' aid Appalachia , expand the arearedevelopment program and provide for Presidential succession . These bills automatically died when the last - Congress adjourned , but have been reintroduced this year . Since they were considered by the Senate last year , only brief hearings , if any , may be required in Sen-. ' ate committees this year . With no legislation yet on the calendars , the Senate and the House will hold only per ! functory sessions this week . The Senate will meet Tuesday , then recess until Friday . " That will give the committees a chance to get going , " Senator Mansfield said . President Johnson 's series of special messages began last week with proposals for a broad health program , including hospital care for the aged under Social Security . He will follow this up with proposals for a $1.5 billion educational program on Tuesday .

Hoping to avoid opposition of parochial-school spokesmen , the President wilt ask for Federal aid in purchasing books and other instructional supplies for children in both public and private schools . On the university and college level , the President will propose Federal scholarships to poor but , aidhigh-schooL graduates ; aid to college libraries ; additional loans and more part-time ; jobs for college students ; the ; establishment of an urban extension program patterned aft ; er the Agricultural Extension ; Service ; and a program of faculty exchange between established and underdeveloped ! colleges , primarily Negro institutions . On Wednesday . the President will send Congress a message ! embodying the details of his pledge , made in the State of the Union Message , to seek a : new immigration law ' ' based on the work a man can do and not ; where he was born or how he spells his name . " Mr. Johnson 's proposal is likely to parallel closely legislation considered by the last Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replace it with a system weighed by factors involving work skills and the number of relatives a ! prospective immigrant already I has in the United States . The President 's proposals for foreign aid will go to the Congress on Thursday . He is expected to ask for about $3.5 billion . Congress authorized $3.507 billion for the current fiscal year but appropriated just $3.250 billion .
