txt Private insurance companies have canceled employe bonds in city antipoverty programs because of embezzlement investigations of the Human Resources Administration , according to Controller Mario A. Procaccino . Mayor Lindsay has assured the Federal Government that municipal funds would be used to reimburse Federal agencies for any future fraud losses in local programs . The Mayor 's assurance was given in a letter to the Office of Economic Opportunity , which finances community action projects such as job training centers and normally requires bonds to protect the Federal Government against losses . Spokesmen for the Federal agency said last night that it had accepted the Mayor 's pledge as a substitute for bonds . The pledge will make the city liable for losses in antipoverty programs , which receive more than $30-million a year in Federal funds . Mr. Procaccino and other city officials said last night that they did not know immediately whether al programs would not be bonded . The problems of the Human Resources Administration  --  it is being investigated by several agencies ? were compounded yesterday when 500 antipoverty workers walked off their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city was stalling in negotiations to replace a contract that expired June 30 . Controller Procaccino said that he was not certain whether all city antipoverty bonds had been cancelled , but that his office had advanced $2,4-million to finance the Neighborhood Youth Corps and community action projects . These are the major elements of the city 's $60-million-a-year antipoverty program . The funds were advanced , the Controller said , in case there should be any delay in receiving Federal funds because of the bonding cancellation . A spokesman for the H.R.A. administrator , Mitchell I. Ginsberg , was asked whether the cancellations covered Office of Economic Opportunity programs , which receive more than $30-million from Washington , and the Youth Corps , which is largely financed by the Labor Department . The spokesman replied : " Satisfactory arrangements have been made . That is all I can find out at the moment . " Employes Arrested Investigations of embezzlement and the Human Resources Administration have centered on the Youth Corps , which provides jobs for ' slum youths . Seven H.R.A. employes have , been arrested as a result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was taken in 1967 and 1988 . Mr. Ginsberg announced two weeks ago that any embezzlement losses in the Youth Corps would be covered by $8-million in private bonds on the corps employes involved . The 500 strikers , who are clerical workers and aides to social workers , are represented by District Council 37 of the American Federation of State , County and Municipal Employes . Behind the dispute is the reorganization of the city 's Council Against Poverty . The union formerly bargained with the local community corporations that carry out the antipoverty program , but the city now wants the council to be its bargaining agent . District 37 would remain the certified agent of the employes . The city wanted the council to be its bargaining agent because the former practice put the local corporations , which have no control over the size of the appropriations they use , in the position of making fund commitments . Now the council , which makes the allocations of funds , would have the authority to make the commitments . But delay was encountered in bringing this about when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centers and other antipoverty agencies , chanting " Two , four , six , eight , when will they negotiate . " In another action , officials of the antipoverty program held a news conference for the press and for area residents at the Community Corporation of the Lower West Side , 348 West 34th Street . The officials protested " disruption " of the program by rumors and reports about losses by theft and fraud . Charles A. , president of the community corporation , and Jerome L. Kolker , director of its manpower , program , charged that the reports were " inflated . " The director of the Neighborhood Youth Corps , Willie J. Smith , whose program is the center of the investigations , said that it was the respohsibility of the investigators to root out any dishonesty , but that criminal acts of adults should not result in the punishment of youths cooperating in the program . " We do n't mind investigations , " Mr. Smith said . " What we do oppose is using investigations as a way of discrediting blacks and Puerto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the program work better , not provide an excuse for cutting it back . " The Rev. H. Carl McCall , deputy administrator of the Human Resources Administration , said he hoped the City Council would learn that the ' antipoverty program had never seriously faced the problem of adult employment . " An enlightened antipoverty effort , " said Mr. McCall , " would structure into its basic concepts a means for overcoming the dependency of the poor and for truly incorporating poor people into the economic mainstream of American life . " Neighborhood Youth Corpsmen in the midst of training programs asked at the news conference what would happen after Oct. 31 , when the Federal Labor Department 's contract with the city ran out . No answer was given , but a Labor Department spokesman said later that whether or not the city continued as sponsor , " the Youth Corps program will be continued in New York City and nothing will be done that will have an adverse effect on the young people now in the program .
