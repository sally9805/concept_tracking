Every salaried newsman , they say , dreams of some day buying his own little newspaper . For New York Times Columnist James Reston , the dream has come true . Last week he announced that he had purchased the Vineyard Gazette ( average circ. 5,900 ) , the 122-year-old weekly that serves the resort island of Martha 's Vineyard , Mass . If Reston ever gives up his Washington beat to ruminate for the Gazette , it will not be all that much of a comedown . For the Gazette is one of the most colorful and quoted of U.S. weeklies . <P> It is as much a part of the Vineyard scenery as colored clay cliffs and salt marshes . Its present editor , Henry Hough , 71 , who bought it in 1920 , is a regional novelist ( Lament for a City ) and folklorist ( Thoreau of Walden ) . And he has never ceased to celebrate the charms of the Vineyard in his paper . " It ought to be the function of the newspaper , " wrote Hough , who will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the singularities of environment , heritage , custom , and response to challenges . " <P> Not that the Gazette watches only over its own citizenry . In summer , the population swells from 6,000 to some 50,000 , and the paper views the comings and goings of these fair-weather residents with a wry Yankee eye . Max Eastman , Saul Bellow , Thomas Hart Benton , James Cagney , Leonard Bernstein are the stuff of summer gossip . Such is its relish for celebrities that the Gazette mixes fact ' with fantasy in breezy abandon . One memorable item revealed that " Truman Capote and Geraldine Chaplin have checked into the bridal suite of the Menemsha Inn . " <P> Sooner or later , Reston will add his own thoughts to the weekly . He is not sure what he will say but it will not be what his current readers are used to . " It will be interesting to report life , " he says , " instead of politics . "                @ @ @ @ @
