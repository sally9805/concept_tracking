 | COOLNESS AND QUIET enfolded me as I walked into the room . Shadows half hid household objects alien to a Minnesota nun . Others were familiar indeed . A wire basket full of smoked fish hung beside a television set . Prayer sticks with their curled white shavings were thrust into the floor of the stove pit . An electric light bulb dangled overhead . Prints of blackhaired Oriental beauties flanked a sink where a glass tumbler held the family toothbrushes . To the elderly couple who received me , Tsurukichi Seki and his wife Riyo , I surely looked as strange as they did to me . Fresh from the rice fields , he wore loose diaperlike pants and a shapeless brown shirt . Her slight figure was hidden in a Japanese blouse , embroidered apron , baggy bloomers , and bright rolled scarf . My attire was that of a Benedictine nun ? the white of pleated coif and band , the black of veil , the gray of woolen scapular and belted habit . I had come here because my hosts were Ainu ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Geographic Society had made a long-time dream come true . For eight months I would study these " white " aborigines of northern Japan , a people for whom ? as a distinctive culture ? the fires were going out . " Please ! Sit here by the stove . It gives a good warmth ? just as you , American sister , are doing as you come among our Ainu people . Our house is honored by your being here . " With these hospitable words the Sekis welcomed me to their home near Mukawa , a village on the south coast of Hokkaido , northernmost island of the Japanese Archipelago ( map , page 273 ) . I made myself comfortable on a pile of pillows with my stockinged feet pulled up under my habit . I could see my shoes where I had left them at the door . Simmering kettles whispered that soon there would be tea . My host had briefly excused himself to change into neat white pants and T-shirt . He took the place proper  | for the man of the house , sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revered as sacred by the Ainu . Hardly had we settled down when the door opened again to admit other guests . Into the sunlight flooding through the windows stepped two fine old Ainu women . Tsurukichi introduced them to me ? Katanto Kaneko and Mine Honda . Broad blue tattoos spread across their mouths like mustaches . The marks were evidence , I realized , of a passing generation . These women were full-blooded Ainu . Technically , tattooing has been illegal in Japan since the 17th century , but until about fifty years ago such laws were often ignored by people of pure Ainu strain ( pages 269 and 295 ) . The women came forward to greet me in the accepted Ainu manner . Kneeling before me , they bowed so low their heads touched the floor . They kept uttering muted sounds ? half cry , half whine ? the old Ainu way of expressing heartfelt welcome . They rose , and each stroked my face , whimpering with joy , then tested with both hands the muscles in my forearms . How old was I ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why , you have the strength of a much younger woman . " 272 National Geograpli  | We sat down around the central stove , and Riyo Seki passed cups of steaming tea . " Oh , we are very glad you have come , Holy Woman , to put it all down on paper ? to record the way we Ainu used to do things ! " Looking across the teacups at these new friends , I saw in the steady , dark eyes and wrinkled faces heights of pride and depths of sadness . Beneath the dignity I caught the message that had brought me here : A human tide soon would engulf these gentle , warmhearted people , whose very presence in Japan presents a paradox . In appearance and physical traits , in religion , and in many customs , the Ainu differ sharply from the Japanese who so overwhelmingly outnumber them . That the Ainu are not of Mongoloid origin is strongly indicated by a look at a full-blooded Ainu . He has round , dark-brown eyes , curling lashes , prominent eyebrows , rather long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a slight wave . His complexion is quite fair . Men have heavy beards , usually very dark ; old men wear full beards and mustaches . The Ainu language , too , is a puzzle . The oldest Ainu speak it among themselves . They also use it in prayer and when they recite the Yukar , an epic , and the Uwepekere , a group of traditional folk ballads . But younger Ainu no longer speak it , and it has no written form except as its sounds have been expressed phonetically in Japanese . Ainu Grandparents Hold Key to Past My special aim was to study child life , to learn how Ainu youngsters were trained one , two , or three generations ago , before " Japanization " sharply altered the pattern of their upbringing . While recording the environment in which the children grew up , I hoped to learn much about the whole fabric of Ainu life . I would tap the knowledge and wisdom of the older generations , who in their waning years see much of their culture vanishing . I wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the present generation of Ainu grandparents will represent . Japan 's " Hairy Ainu " are concentrated on Hokkaido , their traditional homeland , an island about the size of South Carolina . In addition , there were groups that lived a generation ago on Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands , now part of the Soviet Union ; most of them have migrated to Hokkaido. @# The most generous estimates of the number who remain identifiable as Ainu give a total of 15,000 , and of these the full-blooded Ainu are counted at 300 at most . But even C H I 1 some of the 300 , almost all of them over 60 , show Mongoloid traces , an inheritance from centuries of contact with the Japanese . Tranquil Coast Shelters Vanishing Race Along the south shore of Hokkaido the pearl-gray sea murmurs softly against the pale sands . Fishermen , many of them Ainu , net salmon , sea trout , and herring here . Most of the Ainu settlements I visited lie scattered along an arc of coast between Muroran and Cape Erimo and inland to distances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aboriginal communities have shrunk to mere subdivisions of larger Japanese towns And while some of the Ainu men work as independent farmers and fishermen , many of them seek employment under the Japanese ? in town government , as cab drivers , or as factory workers . At Tomakomai , a newsprint-making tox ' I set up headquarters in a business building that had one floor of hotel rooms . I needed a convenient and comfortable place to plan ms visits among the Ainu , to work on notes , an to review each day 's findings . Two capable Japanese women , fluent t English , joined me as assistants and inter preters . Chiye Sano is Associate Professor Anthropology at Nanzan University in N goya and holds a doctoral degree from t Catholic University of America in Washin ton , D. C. Midori Yamaha recently earn her master 's degree in sociology from Lovo University in Chicago . Without the help this dedicated pair , my work among the At could never have been achieved . Twenty-five miles southwest of Tomako lies the seaside resort town of Noboribe whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ainu fr Nibutani , 50 miles away on the lovely S River , gather to demonstrate their custo and culture to visitors . In Noboribetsu I met 40-year-old Shig Kayano , one of the younger full-blooded . ( page 278 ) . He is a dynamic leader in the eff to salvage all the best of Ainu culture , tho if you passed him on a Chicago street . might take him for an American . Some old Ainu resent any commerciali of their heritage . But Noboribetsu 's chisel ,  | traditional Ainu house , has authenticity and helps perpetuate the Ainu world that was . There one may see the old dances , and exhibitions of wood carving , rush basketry , and the weaving of attush , a cloth made from the inner bark of the elm . " We try to give visitors a little knowledge of what is best and most truly characteristic about the old Ainu life , " Kayano said as he showed me the chisei . It consists of a framework of wood covered by grass , bulrush , or bark , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facing east , and single family room with packed dirt floor and open fire pit . The chisei as a tourist attraction has had this beneficial effect : Ainu art is being newly appreciated . Even in Tokyo 's exclusive shops we saw Ainu designs on sofa pillows , bed- Wicked spirits cause illness . We must drive them away , " old Ainu believe . To treat a crippled man of Nibutani , praying women tie his limbs with bulrush stems and cloth and gently beat him with branches . Then they cut away the bindings with sickles and throw them into the Saru River , shouting and scolding ; thus the " evil ones " flee . In a similar exorcism , a woman with a facial tic ( below at center ) receives treatment beside a good deity , a tree " well shaped and leaning to the east . " An elder offers saki ? rice wine . Friends gesture and stamp to drive out the spirit of sickness . spreads , curtains , and jewelry cases . These designs are printed on wrapping paper , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income and revive self-expression among the Ainu , just as they do among our American Indians . " Certain of our rites and ceremonies are too personal and sacred to be performed in public , " Kayano observed . " For you , though , as a scholar , " he added graciously , " we shall of course be glad to conduct them . " I place Kayano and his young friends among what I call the ardent Ainu , those dedicated few who strive to keep alive the customs and crafts of their forebears . Kayano himself is a skilled carver specializing in exquisite wood trays . Through him I made the acquaintance of Contentment , a gift of old ways : The wife of Ichitaro Nitani broils fish over a sunken hearth . Her husband , whittling a skewer , told the author : " We never forget to toss a little of our food and drink on the coals for the dead and the spirits ? especially the goddess of fire . Our hearth is sacred , and the duty of the wife is to see that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the inaumade of a peeled willow branch with shaved curls attached ? blesses the fireplace . The elder treats it as " a messenger to the deities . " Antique trade goods , heavy necklaces , and other man decorate the wall .  | three charming Ainu women , Misao , 65 , Ume , 76 , and Toroshina , 75 . The last name of all three was Kaizawa , although they were not directly related . A fine tattoo adorned Toroshina 's mouth , and I asked her about this custom . " The Japanese thought our tattooing a cruel practice , so they forbade it , " Toroshina explained . " Maybe it was , but tattooed lips meant we were marriageable . I was tattooed against my will at 17 , but now I 'm glad it was done . I found a husband right away . " Ume had a few words to add : " When I was the right age , I watched another girl being tattooed . It was an awful sight . Some women held her down while another made incisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she was in agony . I hid and never was tattooed . But I got a husband anyway . " The young Ainu girl underwent tattooing , often in three stages , between the ages of : 1 , and 21 . First the lips were washed with a we boiled solution of birch bark and clear wat Then grandmothers or maternal aunts be the painful pricking with a razor-sharp slix . of a knife . They wiped blood away with a cl. ? saturated with the hot bark broth , and in the cuts they rubbed birchwood soot from ? bottom of the cooking kettle . This gave tattoo its blue color and , coming from the cred fire , protected the wearer from evil ent ing the mouth or nose . Days of Power Now Only a Memory For thousands of years the Ainu were . erful in Hokkaido , and some six centuries their settlements extended into Sakhalin the Kuril Islands .

Shigeru Kayano tells the author how such re-creations awaken interest in Ainu culture . He gave her invaluable help in locating his people ; Japanese census figures and records do not specify race . Remembering ancestors , Ainu bring gifts of candy , biscuits , and saki to graves near Nibutani . Needle-eye carving marks a woman 's grave ; spear-shaped post a man 's . Gable-roofed pole indicates Buddhist influence . When burying a relative , women tie bits of charcoal to grave poles for light , so the departed soul can see the way as it seeks relatives in another world . There , Ainu believe , the dead live much as they did on earth . Ainu and people in the southern islands of Japan as well as with those living on Sakhalin and the mainland of Asia ( map , page 273 ) . The Ainu bartered their furs for brocades and beads from the mainland . From the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storage boxes . We saw these boxes in many Ainu homes , where they are still cherished ( page 286 ) . Trade that began as exchange ended in outright exploitation of the Ainu . They became vassals to the feudal landlords of the Japanese Matsumae clan . Finally the Japanese Government asserted its authority over Hokkaido in the 19th century , breaking the power of the Matsumaes . In 1899 Japan 's new Hokkaido Natives Protection law provided the Ainu with land and tools for farming . It also assured all Ainu children an education , but they remained segregated from Japanese students until 1937 . At summer 's close we followed our Noboribetsu friends to their homes in Nibutani . Its friendly houses provided a natural focal point for our work . Of 101 families in the Nibutani area , 80 are of Ainu blood . A little wistfully , Shigeru Kayano explained that today not one Ainu family lives in a traditional Ainu house . But the Ainu fare much better in modern houses than in cold , grass-walled huts . Virtually every Ainu community I saw looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wood , usually unpainted . Corrugated tin or asbestos shingle covers the roofs . Most homes have radios , TV sets , and running water ( pages 284-5 ) . Many dwellings contain small Shinto shrines , reflecting the readiness of younger Ainu to adopt Japanese ways .  | The Ainu are a deeply religious people , and the universal sacred object is the man ( pronounced ee-now ) , or prayer stick . Sometimes prayers seem to be directed to the man itself ; at other times it apparently is a " messenger " between suppliant and deity . Only men make the man . One day at Nibutani I sat down to watch Kashiko Kaizawa fashion one . From a stem of willow he removed the outer bark with his thumbnail . Then with a small knife he expertly shaved surface layers of the wood so that they came up in curls ; he left the paper-thin , spiral streamers attached to the stick . This man was about two feet long ; some are longer and some shorter . Sometimes the carver cuts two or even three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning was a special one to honor the goddess of fire . He made a transverse cut in the middle of the stick to indicate a mouth , then a vertical slash in the same spot , into which ? to represent the heart ? he wedged a piece of charcoal from the fire . While old Matsuji Kaizawa recited prayers , Kashiko reverently stuck the man into the earth floor of the fire pit . Cherished pet , a bear cub models for wood carver Toyoji Teshi at the Ainu village , or kotan , by Lake Akan . Traditional sources of food and clothing ? and intermediaries to the spirit world ? bears are a favorite subject for carvings . Japanese sign identifies the stand as " Liaison Office , Ainu Association . " Mr. Teshi organized fellow tribesmen to improve their livelihood . They moved to Akan to sell handicrafts and entertain the thousands of visitors flocking each summer to Akan National Park . @# Dress alikes do n't make look alikes . Japanese girl at right dons the Ainu 's ceremonial robe , headband , and necklace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her companion , a girl of Ainu blood . Carvings by Indians of northwestern North America inspired the totem pole . I found the man in almost every home , evidently as meaningful a symbol to the Ainu as the cross is to the Christian . Favored places for man , apart from positions near stoves and fire pits ( page 276 ) , were in the corners on each side of the entrance . Sacrifice of Bear Expressed Gratitude Like other primitive religions , the Ainu 's is locked in conservatism , and its rituals are largely petitions for favors or for placation of natural forces . Many of its tenets are colored by superstition . The old Ainu saw spiritual beings called kamui in many things : fire , water , plains , mountains , trees , seas , and animals . With a festival known as iomande , the Ainu honored the kamui , or spirit , of the bear . When the animals awoke from their winter 's sleep , the men went to the forest and captured a cub . Taken to the village , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was two years old . Then the bear was ready to be sacrificed at a festival , which included prayer , dancing , and feasting . Archers first excited the bear by bombarding him with blunt arrows ; then they slew him with a special arrow or knife . Finally the men throttled the dead beast between two logs . By sending the bear 's spirit back to its ancestors , the Ainu showed their appreciation for the creature . They believed the gods provided the bear expressly to feed and clothe them ( opposite ) . The Japanese Government considered the ceremony a cruel one and many years ago made such killings unlawful . Mainstay of the Ainu diet in ages past , the bear is still prized for meat and for the supposed medicinal value of the dried liver and gall bladder . Fewer than 3,000 remain in Hokkaido , but a bear farm beside the Ainu village near Noboribetsu held 46 captive bears at the time of my visit . Once 16 escaped and several had to be shot ? producing an unexpected feast for Kayano and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true Ainu looks upon no single god as ruler of the world , " Kayano told me . " Some people confuse Kotan-kara-kamui as such a being . But Kotan-karaENT/ , CHROME ( C ) NG.S kamui represents the total world as it is viewed by the Ainu . His spiritual embodiment came down to Hokkaido from the skies , established the land of the Ainu . and then went back to the heavens . " On the return trip . " Kayano continued , " he looked back and noticed that he had left his chopsticks behind . This would never do ? they would rot ' So he changed them into willow trees , and the Ainu have preferred willows for their man ever since . " We often joined with Ainu families or with groups of neighbors at their prayers , which are suited to the occasion and often quite impromptu . No loner are prayer gatherings as formalized as they used to be , when the head of the house assigned a particular god to each guest . One would pray to the bear another to fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . A predominant ple was , and still is , for t health of children . On one occasion at Nbutani I observed that t presiding elder , old M suji Kaizawa , still ke  | etty tight control of the group , although each rson chose words to his liking . At intervals , atsuji stroked his beard , waved his open nds heavenward , rubbed them together , ' sed a bowl of saki , dipped his wooden mushe lifter into the bowl , and sprinkled the replace man with the wine . Then he took a sip . is lifter , or libation stick , elegantly carved in shape like an oversize letter opener , kept the nds of his sweeping mustache from drooping into the saki as he drank ( opposite ) . Three times the elder sprinkled a few drops in the fire and lifted the bowl high to drink of it . The bowl passed around to permit each person to drink . Prayers played an important part in Ainu life . One morning , as I strolled with 78-yearold Yoso Kimura beside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . She said a prayer to the river god would go something like this : " Human life could not exist without the river . So we thank you , river , for your favors , and beg of you that this year the salmon will run thick in the streams . " For the bear festival , Yoso said , the supplication might follow this pattern : " Oh , bear ! You are good to humans . You give your fur for our bedding and our coats . You give us meat to eat . We shall perform some dances in your honor . Then we shall send you back to your own country in the sky with many gifts for your fellow bears . " From fields and forests , the early Ainu derived potions and antidotes for almost every ailment . Many remain in use today . In Noboribetsu , I watched Misao Kaizawa drying herbs hung on a line above her stove . " To cure our children of stomach-ache , we blend two plants : sweet flag and celandine . It works so well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cold early , eat soup made of deer and bear bones . But if the cold has set in , it 's best to inhale the steam from boiled mint . " Malignant spirits caused sickness , accidents , broken limbs , house burnings , drownings . When a man drowned at sea , all Ainu men in his village marched in single file along the beach with swords in their hands . " Ya , ho ! Ya , ho ! " they cried . Thrusting with swords and shouting vehemently , they menaced the evil spirit that had drowned the man . Elaborate rituals have long been used to exorcise the evil spirits that cause neuralgia , rheumatism , facial tics , and convulsions . In some places these ceremonies , attractive simply as costumed pageantry , have been abandoned for fear of ridicule . In Nibutani a woman with a facial tic was to receive treatment . Kayano encouraged us to record this exorcism , since it was one of those considered so sacred that it would never be performed for outsiders . In a generation or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elder , always leads , and at this ritual Matsuji Kaizawa presided in handsome robes . He wore a crown of woven strips of bark with a small carved bear head at the front . His long white beard accentuated his great dignity of bearing and gesture . Four attendant women and another man helped Matsuji . First there were prayers before the outdoor altar near Matsuji 's house . A row of forked poles formed the altar , and from the forks stared out vacantly the enshrined skulls of bear , deer , fox , squirrel ; their departed spirits are much honored by the Ainu as messengers to the other world . The little procession then walked solemnly  | to a shapely nara tree . I watched the old man unsheath his long sword and stomp six times around the tree , thrusting and slashing toward it as if he were cutting down the invisible being who had caused the tic . All except the sick woman prayed constantly and moved their feet in unison to the slow , rhythmic sound of unintelligible mumblings ( page 275 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman 's mouth . With deft knife strokes the female assistants sliced through bands of bark placed previously around the subject 's neck . Then they beat her gently with leafy branches to drive out the wicked spirit . Whether this colorful ceremony effected cure , I do not know : I did not see the patient again . When I asked Kayano if the ardent Ainu ? and only these would undergo such a treatment ? regularly patronize the trained town doctors , he said that they did . " Do they try their own ritual cures before or after visits to the doctor ? " " Both . If one fails , they try the other One day I strolled in a seaside Ainu village or kotan near Shiraoi , between Tomakcr mai and Noboribetsu . As I passed a shop . I was greeted by its owner , Takeichi Moritake , a kindly elder of the old school . He had  | Twang of a mukkuri gives the beat as ' S-year-old Kisa Shitakawara plays an Ainu instrument similar to a jew'sharp . Thread blurs as her hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recalls hunters stalking a bear . With no written language , Ainu transmit their history and teachings in song and story . The author recorded epic poems , chants , lullabies , and tongue twisters . Sometimes the good-natured performers broke into laughter during a demonstration . Scroll-and-bracket designs , embroidered in chain stitch , decorate many Ainu ceremonial robes . recognized me from the publicity that preceded my visit . The old gentleman had published a book of poems in Japanese , and now he wrote a special one for me : An aftermath of typhoon ? clouds moving fast . A cool breeze across the big lake Gives one a chill toward the evening When a religious woman visits me . Her card says Benedictine Sister . She 's here to inquire Into the ways and customs Of old among the Ainu .... Moritake has a profound knowledge of things Ainu , and I asked him to tell me about his people 's belief in life after death . " All Ainu go to another world where they live much as they did here on earth , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of souls . The body of the deceased is an empty shell , so we Ainu say , Toss it away ! ' " When we old Ainu eat or drink , we always share a little with the dead . We say , This is for them , ' and then we throw it into the fire . After that we eat the remainder . When we drink saki , we throw a few drops toward the stove , saying , This is for the dead . ' " Ainu never mention their dead by name . Instead , a mother speaks of a deceased child as " my youngest , " " my oldest , " " my second born . " On the death of a married woman , her house and all its contents were formerly burned to the ground . The Ainu reasoned that in the other world she would need a home . Nowadays a very small house is built and burned . The Ainu have come to revere their old cemeteries . Kayano took us one day to visit the one near Nibutani where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But we can not go there empty-handed , " said Kayano . " We must offer food and saki to the dead . " So we stopped at a country store to buy sweet cakes , candies , and a bottle of saki . From the road a hillside path led through scrub bamboo and tall grass high above the Saru River . Tree branches obstructed our view . I lost my footing and started sliding . One of my assistants helped me back up to the slippery path . Soon we reached the grave markers ? slabs or posts of weather-beaten wood . Those for men had spearlike tops , while the women 's were pierced with an eye , like that of a needle ( page 279 ) . Kayano strewed candy and biscuits on the graves of his relatives , and poured saki over the markers . He asked us to do the same . Then he scattered the rest of the sweets and liquor at random across the cemetery for all the others buried there . Turning back to the world of the living , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ainu once called Shimbu-Chari or " a place where people fish early in the morning . " Father Donald J. Vittengl , an American Maryknoll missionary , met us at the station , and we piled into his truck to jolt along to the seashore .  | Daydreams grow like dandelions on a summer day for the 13-year-old son of Shigeru Kayano . Like other teen-agers in Japan , he wants to reach 16 quickly so he can qualify for a motorbike license . Little boat sailing a sea of air lulls a baby to sleep . Interested in child training , the author asked this elder what Ainu attribute he would most like the youngster to have . He answered , " Faith in the Ainu way . " We found Ainu women and a few men out in the shallow sea filling sacks with sea urchins . Families scattered along the shore cracked open these spiny little creatures with stone or hammer and with forefingers scooped out a jellylike orange substance which they popped into their mouths . Another day on the same beach , other Ainu harvested tangles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make relish . The green-black strands , six to eight feet long , were pulled from the sea early in the morning and laid out to dry on the pebblestrewn beach or on straw mats . When dried , they were cut into three-foot lengths and sorted for quality before being sold . The Ainu must exploit every source of food , for Hokkaido , its protected wilds notwithstanding , no longer abounds in game . One fine old Ainu man , who showed me a calling card identifying him as a " former chief , " told us how he longed for past plent " Life was so easy in those days , " he said " There was always so much to eat . If I was hungry , I went up into those hills over there and shot a deer or rabbit or raccoon .

" Are you Hilger-San ? the holy lady fro America here to learn about the Ainu ? " The voice was that of a Japanese man . asked if I might help him .  | " Ah , no , " he replied . " But I can help you . I know where the Ainu came from ! " This was extraordinary news , for to my knowledge , nobody knows exactly where the Ainu came from ? or when . Their striking but superficial resemblance to Europeans ? round eyes , wavy hair , and fair skin ? have suggested to many a Caucasoid origin , and anthropologists in the past have speculated that the ancestors of the Ainu came to Japan from the northwest , through Siberia . Other scientists have tried to relate the Ainu to Australia 's aborigines , suggesting that Ainu forebears migrated from the south . There is another possibility that challenges scholars : Were the Ainu descendants of the prehistoric people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remains distinctly different from those in the rest of Japan ? Perhaps my Ainu friends are the last of a separate race who have made Hokkaido their home for 7,000 years . There are so many theories ; yet the mystery of the Ainu remains veiled in the mists of time . But here on the telephone was a man with the answer . I invited him to tea , and soon a genial young Japanese was sitting beside me . Flying Saucers No Puzzle to Guest " You have come just in time , " said my guest . " The end of the Ainu is at hand . But I can tell you of their beginning . " They came from the skies , " Tsutomu Kuwada declared . " Yes , from the skies ! Their ancestors were space people ? the same who still live in the clouds and send those flying saucers to earth . " In the course of my fieldwork I was to learn  | that many an Ainu elder believes in this legend of the Ainu 's origin in space .

Crane 's Flight Inspires a Dance One of our jaunts farthest afield took us to scenic Akan National Park in the wilds of eastern Hokkaido . An Ainu kotan stands beside Lake Akan , a glorious sheet of blue water framed by mountains , one of them a volca292 no puffing peacefully like a reclining giant . Close to the beach here , Toyoji Teshi , the Ainu leader of the kotan , staged for us the colorful dances that draw travelers to Akan from afar.In the Crane Dance the handsomely costumed girls flapped bright capes lifted over heads and arms to imitate flying birds . For the Trembling Pine Tree Dance , the girls violently flung their hair backward and forward . In the Bow Dance , bearded Zenjiro Ishikawa strutted through a stylized hunting pantomime ( page 271 ) . Reticence on the part of parents hampered me a little in certain areas of my child study .  | till , I learned a great deal about Ainu trations of child raising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ainu children at all . I observed that Ainu children , mixing with Japanese at school and play , betray no awareness that they are any different . It embarrasses them to talk about the customs of former times or to participate in Ainu ceremonies . The elderly folk perforce acquiesce and try to carry on as their hearts dictate " without getting in the way of the younger generation , " as I heard it stated . In a small place called Higashi-Shizunai I met an outstanding Ainu , Taro Sasaki , who breeds race horses on his Sasaki Horse Pastures ( following pages ) . A full-blooded Ainu 62 years old , he proved to be one of our most helpful informants . He voiced staunch pride in his ancestry and the customs of his people . " This little boy , " and he pointed to his twoyear-old grandson , " is the tenth generation of Ainu in this valley . " As we sat around the stove in Sasaki 's home , our host started talking about children , for he had read in the newspaper of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try out homemade stilts and make himself tall as a man .

Only quick-maturing , frost-resistant rice grows during Hokkaido 's short season .  | " Ainu child training has always been based on preparing for a useful adulthood , " Sasaki said . " Now , as in former times , quick movement , alertness , and promptitude are the most important attributes for an Ainu boy . If he possesses these , he will be a good hunter and fisherman .

I used small bows and arrows and spears when I was only three years old and soon handled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys close to them so they could learn by watching and imitating . " A child must be disciplined but he needs affection , too , " Sasaki continued . " But a boy or girl should never be kissed by a bad person , for badness like sickness can be contagious . " As with boys , the training of young Ainu girls emphasizes both craftsmanship and character . The Ainu mother and grandmother take very seriously their duty of teaching girls weaving , sewing , embroidery , and cooking . Early training is reflected in the superb needlework of older Ainu women .

The Yukar ? its name means " to imitate " ? draws its themes from the mystical interplay between the Ainu and the natural world about him . It tells of the human frailties and foibles of birds and animals as they played the parts of manlike gods . " No one knows all of the Yukar , " Riyo said . " It does n't seem likely , in fact , that anyone ever could have known it all . " We moved closer to the fire , and Riyo recited in Ainu a good forty minutes of the Yukar . I was fascinated , watching the fluidity of her expressions as the mood of the poem changed . She sang certain portions and played other parts in dialogue . Some passages she spoke angrily , some she whispered , some had a joyous lilt , and others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looked skyward , then gazed off into imagined distances .

Our able photographic collaborators , Eiji Miyazawa , who has illustrated this article so superbly , and movie cameraman GoroTsud produced an extraor nary film documentation of Ainu personalities and folkways . When the time came to take leave of our fir hosts , the Sekis , several of their friends a peared ? Katanto Kaneko , Mine Honda , a Ume Abe , two of them with their husbands . " We must bid you farewell in the Ain way , " said Riyo . The men raised and lowered their han and bowed . The women uttered mournt whining sounds .
