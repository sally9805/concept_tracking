In his old age , Raoul Dufy fretted a great deal over the fate of the painting he considered a masterpiece , the gigantic mural called The Fairy Electricity . Shown at the 1937 International Exposition in Paris , it was later cut up into 250 sections and stored in a musty warehouse . Despite Dufy 's best efforts , no place could be found big enough to exhibit the mural permanently . <P> Now , eleven years after Dufy 's death , the painting has been reassembled and installed in the great semi-elliptical hall of Paris ' Museum of Modern Art , where it has become the major attraction of a mediocre institution . Crowds shuffle back and forth , dazzled by the light bouncing off The Fairy Electricity 's lacquered surface-for real electricity has not served to light it very well . <P> Tossed in amidst sprouting red volcanoes , traffic lights , an orchestra , lightning , tricolored smoke , tankers , sail boats and quiet pastoral scenes stand 110 greats of the history of science . To make things less bewildering for the literate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them - Archimedes , who once ran naked through the streets of Syracuse , Thales , Aristotle , Leonardo , Bacon , Galileo , Faraday , Pascal , Morse , Edison , Bell , Helmholtz-in the nude . Then he had extras from the Comdie Franchise model period costumes while be dressed up his pantheon . <P> But is it the masterpiece Dufy thought it to be ? Its central focus , a dynamo rendered blueprint-style in all its 1937 grandeur , is sublimely anachronistic ; its diversity makes it seem a collage of pages from a sketchbook ; its pretentious setting heightens all its weaknesses . Somewhat ambiguously , the museum bills the mural as " the world 's largest painting " ; viewers go away feeling that they have seen the world 's largest hand-painted billboard.
