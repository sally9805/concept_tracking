For many Germans , Ash Wednesday holds an extra measure of solemnity . It marks the end of the gay Fasching season , about the only time of the year when a middle-aged widower or a plain , bespectacled spinster can break out of the everyday litany of loneliness and-who knows ? - find true love across a crowded beer hall . Of those who were still lonely as Fasching ended last week , many would not wait for next year 's festivities ; they will turn instead to one of West Germany 's 200 marriage agencies , such as the booming " Institute for Elegant Individual Marriage Initiation . " Chirped Bonn Marriage Broker Alice Paech on Ash Wednesday : " Now it will start all over again . " <P> Wagnerian Supermen . For a " searching fee " that averages about $50 , buxom Frau Paech and other professional Cupid chasers will methodically remake the whimsical old game according to cold Teutonic logic . Clients are interviewed for the necessary information-background , interests , social status , financial situation - and brought together through carefully matched briefing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduces , Frau Paech manages to find the right combination , and collects a " success fee " equal to the searching fee-unless the happy couple forget to notify her that they are getting married . <P> West German papers are filled with such agency-placed ads as " A heart to give away-am 39 , 160 centimeters tall , alone , not ugly , but wearer of glasses , " or " Hello , hello ! What young man between 35 and 45 would like to try his happiness with me ? " Agencies make a paunchy male sound like a Wagnerian superman , a wilting wallflower a paragon of charm and virtue . Many agencies put love on a chain-store basis , increasing the chance for a successful match by trading clients among as many as 32 branches . Drawing clients from every class and profession , marriage brokers account for 60.000 to 80.000 marriages every year . <P> Security First . Today 's thriving trade is the outgrowth of a business that has had its greatest boom during the man-short years following World War II . The main reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family ministry , is that " there is a lack of real social life in West Germany today-we have become a little selfish and do n't concern ourselves much with our fellow men . " Known by the unromantic name of Ehlanbahnunsgewerbe - literally , the marriage-initiating business-it has inevitably attracted many brokers less interested in mating souls than coining Deutsche marks . " There are as many serious marriage agencies as there are Cabinet members in Bonn , " a German magazine claimed recently . <P> But the customers seldom complain . Most seek financial security rather than good looks . Women are particularly fond of men from the Benelux countries , and are especially leary of bakers , butchers and innkeepers , afraid that they will ask them to help out with the business . And how about love ? " Love , " sniffs one German , " is for teen-agers-and Frenchmen . "
