txt Vice President Humphrey started running for the White House yesterday in the comforting comparm of the big men of labor arid along the politically promising streets of New York City , knowing that it would be uphill from here on . " I think this is good Demo. cratic territory , " said the Democratic candidate for President after marching up Fifth Avenue and reviewing other Labor Day marchers with George Meany , Harry Van Arsdale , David Dubinsky and the rest of the old New Deal warriors .. The question before them this Labor Day was whether union members could be roused to greater enthusiasm for their politics than for their parade . Shows No Doubts Mr. Humphrey , though he finds himself the underdog for the moment across the nation , showed no doubts here . He - is counting firmly on New York 's electoral votes and labor 's money and manpower as he begins a carefully calculated campaign effort . " I ' am.going to walk up this avenue and right into the White House , " the Vice President remarked . His appearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He expects to go on concentrating on the big population areas , where the jets can land and where the television cameras and voters are in ' easy reach . He made no formal speech here but answered questions for three television and radio interviewers , and that , too , is part of his tactical design . Trail of Publicity The interviews did not range very far beyond earlier statements , but they left a trail ' of broadcast and newspaper publicity that lingered beyond the Vice President 's early evening departure for his retreat , in Waverly , Minn . This sort . - of scheduling is planned for most campaign visits , instead of the usual nighttime rallies that require big crowds but come too late for the television news shows and morning papers . In the interviews , Mr. Humphrey offered some kind words for Senator Eugene J. McCarthy in a stronghold of McCarthy supporters . The Senator 's candidacy , Mr. Humphrey said , caused the Administration to re-examine its Vietnam policy and " we are all the better for it . " The Vice President also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Senate , would come to " see that the choice is ultimately be // tween Mr. Nixon and myself . " Mr. Humphrey recalled that Mr. O'Dwyer , who has said he will not support his party 's Presidential ticket , " was a. strong supporter of mine " in 1960 . He offered some criticism of the Chicago police for its " overreaction " to provocations that were " almost beyond endurance " during the Democratic National Convention last week . He also moderated somewhat his expressions of support on Saturday for the politically important Mayor of Chicago , Richard J. Daley , saying that the Mayor " did n't want to condone the beating of these people with clubs  --  I do n't condone it . " The Vice President suggested that a school of law or journalism empanel a group of experts to study the violence , the demonstrators , the police and the role of , the news media . Strikes Out at Nixon Mr. Humphrey also set out in hopeful pursuit of his Republican opponent , Richard M. Nixon , saying that he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by thinking the people wished to " stand pat " for the sake of law and order . The Democrats offer progress and will not " make a compact with extremism " merely to be elected , he added . The Vice President was interviewed by WNDT-TV , the educational station that showed the program last night . He also visited Jerry Lewis 's telethon at the Americana Hotel for muscular dystrophy and made a radio tape in his Waldorf Towers suite with Barry Gray for broadcast by WMCA tonight . Mr. Humphrey 's private polls have shown that what voters of all persuasions want most is a sense of participation in the political process , a feeling that they can be heard and have their doubts addressed. ! For that " reason , and because , he thinks he is good at it , lie plans to submit to questioning on campuses , in shopping centers and broadcast studios , hoping that the answers will rebound around the community after he leaves . He plans to rest for two days in Waverly or Washington after every four or five days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and traveling evenings to start refreshed each morning . Major policy declarations will be held for position papers to be issued during the days of rest so that demonstrators and other diversions do not steal attention from them . Debate With Nixon Wanted Besides debating voters and interviewers , Mr. Humphrey wants to debate Mr. Nixon , but only if the third party challenger , George C. Wallace of Alabama , can be excluded . The Vice President considers Mr. Wallace a demagogue against whom there can be no effective debate . Even without debates , the Humphrey campaigners will try to taunt and rattle Mr. Nixon into mistakes and into statements that may cost him support among moderates who came to dislike him in the campaigns of the 1950s . The baiter-in-chief will be former Gov . Edmund G. Brown of California , who took Mr. Nixon 's measure in 1962 before losing the Governorship to Gov . Ronald Reagan in 1966 . Mr. Brown will precede the Republican candidate around the country on Mr. Humphrey 's behalf while a " truth squad , " not yet formed , follows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Humphrey 's running mate , will be employed heavily in New England , on informal television shows that will show off his rugged good looks , and among big-city minority groups whose resentment of Negroes may cause them to desert the Democratic party . Mr. Muskie is a Roman Catholic of Polish ancestry . Also available for the Humphrey campaign will be Senators Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts , Wayne Morse of Oregon and George S. and Gov . Harold E. Hughes of Iowa , all of whom held out for a more dovish party position on Vietnam before nomination night in Chicago . President Johnson is the only big Humphrey supporter not now in line for a major campaign assignment , except possibly in his native Texas , which the Vice President thinks he can carry only with a vigorous effort . Elsewhere , Mr. Johnson 's backing is not now seen as very useful and in many places it is judged harmful . The private polls suggest that Mr. Humphrey still retains his traditional popularity as a liberal and fighter for civil rights among these groups , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the movement .
