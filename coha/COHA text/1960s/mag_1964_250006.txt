However disappointing the campaign might have been , at least one editorial hand found plenty of cause for mirth . <P> New York Herald Tribune Staffer Harry Marsh , whose duties include rounding up and reprinting editorials from other papers , was jolted by a wry campaign observation in the Buffalo Evening News . " A good turnout can be expected at the polls in November , " predicted the News . " Most voters used up their apathy watching the conventions . " Could it be , Marsh wondered , that the lusterless campaign had provided a setting for editorial whimsy ?

" The Wichita , Kans. , Eagle affected dismay after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President to expose himself to the afflictions which beset the nursery crowd ? Measles or whooping cough in the White House could have repercussions for the whole free world . " The Washington Star was amused by the Johnsonian declaration that " for the first time in history , profits are higher than ever before " : " With the above offering , the Chief has taken his place alongside those forgotten orators who reminded us that The future lies ahead , ' and that The boys of today will be the men of tomorrow . ' " The Philadelphia Bulletin detected a new earnestness of rhetoric in the campaigns last week : " Until Election Day , Voltaire 's famous remark is amended to read , T will defend to the death your right to say what you have just said , but if you say it again , I 'll poke you one in the kisser. ' "
