Shock Treatment is more than a slip , it 's a Freudian pratfall . It makes a shambles of psychiatry and brings the art of film close to idiocy . Stuart Whitman is hired to bluff his way into a mental hospital where Psychotic Killer Roddy McDowall may or may not reveal the location of $1,000,000 in stolen cash . But malevolent Psychiatrist Lauren Bacall also craves money , to continue her research . When she hits on Whitman 's game , she prescribes electroshock therapy , then injects a concoction into his jugular vein to induce catatonia . <P> <P> The " horrible twisted images " Whitman reports seeing may well be his fellow players , feigning madness in the best amateur style while a sound track symphony booms music to go to pieces by . As a manic-depressive sex kitten , Carol Lynley somehow suggests that a good fortified cereal would put her back together again . McDowall and Whitman , tending the rose garden , make thorny work of it . And Actress Bacall , woefully miscast , exercises her steel-and-velvet charm as if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's throatiest , most telling line : " I detest stupid people who think they can fake mental illness . " Fortunately , nobody need submit to Shock Treatment unless he is dragged in screaming .
