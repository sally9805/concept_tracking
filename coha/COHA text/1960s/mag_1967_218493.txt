After being picked by President Johnson for the No. 2 post in the Agency for International Development , Rutherford ( " Rud " ) Poats had to wait six months for Senate confirmation of his appointment . The opposition to Poats was led by Indiana Democrat Birch Bayh , whose objections increasingly seemed to be motivated as much by vindictiveness as by vigilance .
