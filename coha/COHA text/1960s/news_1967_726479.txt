txt Edward Heath , leader of the Conservative Party , visualizes a truly prosperous , newly skilled Britain looming up ahead . But he sees no prospect whatsoever that Britain can achieve this greatness under a Labor Government . In an interview , sharp-minded Mr. Heath , sometimes termed the Tory 's political technocrat , amplified his recent major policy speech at Carshalton , Surrey . He declared that new incentives , a new climate of worker opinion , less government interference , and a revised tax structure could produce a bright future for Britain . " What we need are changed attitudes , " a well-tanned Mr. Heath declared , speaking vigorously in his office at the House of Commons . " In the United States you people do n't think it extraordinary if industrial innova* // Keystone Conservative Edward Heath ' We need . . . changed attitudes ' *Heath rakes British Labor rule // tion requires a man to take up a new career , move his family to another state , and undergo retraining at 30 years of age . Contrast drawn " Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in eying industries . It will require real effort to revise such attitudes . " Mr. Heath has the utmost scorn for the Labor government 's continued efforts to nibble its way into industry , as now by a proposed bill to permit government shareholding in faltering industries , without nationalization . " This looming persistent interference is bad for industry , " the Conservative leader declared . " It undermines morale . " Let the government act in its own sphere to make its own operations and the nationized industries more efficient . " Competitive need cited Mr. Heath argued that industry , if sad-died with a heavy sector of government ownership or control , would compete very poorly in the European Common Market , if and when Britain gains admission . Mr. Heath was reminded of Prime Minister Harold Wilson 's boast that , by the time the next general election rolls around , Britain 's economy will have moved out of its freeze and squeeze and onto a plateau of high prosperity  --  hence that Labor would again be returned to power . " If you believe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe anything , " Mr. Heath retorted . Tory campaigner Heath , in the 1966 election , was accurate in his forecasts of economic trouble ahead , and in his insistence that Britain must reapply for admission into Europe . Yet public opinion polls , excepting for a few weeks , have put Labor consistently in the lead since then . Mr. Heath was asked how he explained this . " Labor has been in office only 15 months , " he replied . " The public is long-suffering , willing to give a government its chance . And voters do n't readily say , ' What fools we were , to listen to Labor 's claims . ' But this will change . " I do n't like to deal in terms of images and polls . If you 're concerned with your political image , this suggests you are presenting phoney claims . What you stand for is what counts . " It was suggested to Mr. Heath that he was slashingly critical of leading Laborites , beginning with Mr. Wilson , and that this perhaps harmed his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he replied . " And if you are referring to some present leaders , I am entirely willing to praise their cleverness and , let us say , their political agility . " Labor Party leaders have claimed that they alone could manage a wage freeze because they alone could persuade the trade unions to accept it . Mr. Heath was asked whether he felt that the tough Tory program , calling for registration of trade unions , legally binding labor contracts , and abolition of restrictive practices , could be made to work . " I believe the trade unions would be ready to accept a program which produced higher wages , greater opportunities , and avoided a compulsory wage freeze , " he replied . National need depicted " There needs to be a changed climate of opinion  --  even to accept worker retraining for instance . But these are the kind of battles that are worth fighting . And I believe that privately many trade union leaders would like to see these changes . " " I perceive a new Britain up ahead . Better education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reform to lift the crushing weight of taxation from British initiative , worker retraining , cost efficiency applied to government , welfare made selective so as to help more effectively the really needy . These are what 's required : These are what Labor is not producing . " Mr. Heath was reminded that during the 1966 campaign it was charged that he was " anti-American " because he stressed the need for joining the Common Market and played up his conversations with President de Gaulle . " That is rubbish , " the Tory leader replied . " What I said was that Mr. Wilson was relying more on the United States than any Prime Minister had ever done  --  overrelying ? and he still is . I was criticizing Mr. Wilson , not the United States or American policy . " The Tory leader has made three recent policy speeches ; one on education , one on law reform , one on the state of the economy . He intends to continue rounding out Conservative policy in a further series of speeches during autumn tours around Britain .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
