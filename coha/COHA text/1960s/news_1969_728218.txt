txt Watch for a discreet downgrading of the Gibraltar issue by Spain . The new Foreign Affairs Minister , Gregorio Lopez Bravo , who displaced Fernando Maria Castiella in the recent Cabinet reshuffle , will put hard realities ahead of prestige and sentimental yearnings . A hard reality is this : The famous Rock lost to the British 265 years ago is a mere pinpoint on the map , 21/4 square miles small  --  a historic landmark and little else . Farther south , on northern Africa 's Atlantic coast lies Spanish Sahara , an area of 105,448 square miles immensely rich in phosphates . While Spain has been pressing for decolonization of Gibraltar , Morocco has been pressing for decolonization of Spanish Sahara . In the decolonization race between the two , Spain has made no headway on Gibraltar but Morocco and Mauritania have grown more insistent about Spanish Sahara , which both covet . To take the heat off Spanish Sahara , prospects are that Mr. Lopez Bravo will stop the buildup of pressure on Gibraltar , both at the UN and at the Rock itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : establishment by Spain of consular and commercial relations with Hungary . This new " opening " to the Communist East will be a follow-up to similar agreements Spain signed with Poland last July and with Romania in January , 1967 . But there are no signs at present of full diplomatic relations with representation at ambassadorial level . For reasons of ideology and political expediency , neither Franco Spain nor East Europe 's Communists want to go that far . After all , it was in the name of anticommunism that Generalissimo Francisco Franco founded his right-wing authoritarian regime 33 years ago . For their part , the Communist states would rather not shock the Communist parties in Western Europe by moving all that close to the Generalissimo at this late date in the Franco era . The British Government will be closely eyeing the Common Market summit as it gets under way in The Hague next month . Reason : Its application for membership is likely to sit in the " pending " tray until the Six can work out some mutually acceptable method of winding up the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ad hoc farm system now operating is fine for the French . They receive from the common kitty twice as much as they pay in . The Germans , however , take out only a third of what they put in . And they see themselves financing the EEC 's massive and growing food surplus . The transitional period is meant to end Dec. 31 with agreement on a new farm policy . The French naturally are determined to see the present farm financing methods retained . The Germans , Italians , Dutch , and Belgians are pressing for a fairer sharing of the farm-support burden . They also want expensive overproduction to be curtailed . Certainly , until the Six can agree on at least the central theme of farm policy for the ' 70 's there is little hope of Britain 's plea for entry being transformed into actual negotiations . Even one of Britain 's warmest allies , West Germany 's Chancellor Willy Brandt , now feels that tighter economic integration of the Six is a higher priority than British entry . Without such consolidation , he fears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national interests . If that happened , he would have little hope of Western Europe mustering enough unity to forge a possible East-West settlement , so important to Bonn . Trends ... In Switzerland where people are in no particular hurry for change , suffrage for women is moving ahead ? at the speed of a glacier . Latest crack in the ice occurred at French-speaking Fribourg where the voters ? all men , of course  --  cast their " ours " to change their canton 's constitution to allow women to vote in local elections . The plurality was impressive-19,029 for , 7,771 against . A sharp contrast to the same vote 10 years ago when the men of Fribourg divided in almost exactly the same proportions , but then they were voting no instead of yes . If , as expected , the text of the constitutional change is approved by voters next year , Fribourg will become the seventh of Switzerland 's 25 cantons and half cantons to introduce voting rights for women -- in local elections only .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
