Katanga , the southernmost and richest province of the Congo , is a land of eroded mountains , rocky plateaus , and grassy savannas where lions and dwarf elephants still roam . Though twice the size of Oregon , Katanga is sparsely populated with 1,750,000 Congolese , and some 40,000 Europeans who are mostly employed by the Union Miniere du Haut-Katanga , a cartel owned by Belgian , British and U.S. investors which mines 60% of the free world 's cobalt , 10% of its uranium and 8% of its copper . Before independence , Katanga supplied 60% of the income of the Belgian Congo . Katanga 's Premier Moise Tshombe , 41 , the man who possesses the key to this treasure house , had obviously decided it would be foolish to share it with the crumbling central government of Patrice Lumumba . <P> Self-Feeding . Tshombe ( pronounced Chombay ) is a rarity in the Congo , since he was born to a life of relative ease . His father was wealthy even by European standards , owned vast plantations in the vicinity of Musumba . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course in accounting before setting up as a trader in everything from peanuts to beer . Handsome and pleasure-loving , Tshombe has fathered eight children by his wife , the daughter of a chief , as well as an undisclosed number of illegitimate offspring . <P> As a member of the so-called " civilized " native middle class , Tshombe was given special privileges and responded by hanging in his office the pictures of Belgium 's King Baudouin and Leopold II , who founded the Belgian Congo . As a political figure , Tshombe lacks the fanatic passion of nationalists like Patrice Lumumba . His common sense and essential conservatism are reflected in his Cona-kat Party , which draws its strength from tribal leaders such as Mwenda Munongo , the grandson of the last Katanga King , M'Siri , who ruled until 1891 and was chiefly famed for his favorite punishment of enemies : they were tied to trees , starved , and then fed their own limbs until they had cannibalized themselves . <P> Facts of Life . The power behind Tshombe is the potent Union Miniere du Haut-Katanga , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adviser when he attended the Brussels conference last February that gave independence to the Congo . Patrice Lumumba , who hates Tshombe , derisively pointed out that Tshombe always consulted with the U.M.H.K. officials before saying anything . A company executive says that U.M.H.K. backs him because " he is a businessman who understands dollars and cents . " <P> While Lumumba and other hotheads were mouthing phrases about liberty and freedom , Tshombe kept hammering away at the economic and financial facts : the Congo would collapse without continuing Belgian investment and technical help . He also had no desire to see Katanga 's riches used to improve the lot of the Congo 's five other provinces , fought for a states ' - rights system with provincial ownership of mineral rights . Said he last week : " Let us face the truth . Democracy does not exist at the moment . It will be years before Africans here consider themselves Congolese rather than members of individual tribes .
