Though born a Greek , Andreas Papandreou grew up to become as American as Harvard Yard and the U.S. <P> Navy . He served time in both before and during World War II , stayed on to marry an Illinois girl and become chairman of the economics department at the University of California at Berkeley . But once a Greek , always a Greek . Drawn by nostalgia and political ambition , he went home three years ago and gave up his U.S. citizenship . Last February , he got himself elected to Parliament and promptly became the top aide to Greece 's Premier-who happens to be his father , George Papandreou . Last week the prodigal son had reason to wonder just how Greek the Greeks would allow him to be . <P> <P> On his return , Andreas ( " my eagle , " the Premier calls him ) soon emerged as a real comer in Greek politics , able , ambitious and his father 's son . Too much so , the opposition decided , and even his friends had occasion to agree . Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andreas played all sides of a question when it suited him . He accepted an invitation to attend a conference of nonaligned nations , then did not go . As the " Minister to the Premier " - his father 's right-hand man-he moved in on other Cabinet members , virtually running the Greek economy . To prove his Greekness , he abruptly canceled Voice of America rebroadcasts , was quoted as making anti-NATO statements ( which he later denied ) , and forced the transfer of the U.S. Information Agency chief from Athens . <P> <P> At 44 , Andreas was even talked about as a successor to his father , 76 . Opposition conservatives and his father 's own center supporters finally decided to give Andreas his comeuppance - and , indirectly , take a poke at the Premier too . George , wrote one newspaper , " must sacrifice his son . " They planted stories alleging that Andreas had a " Trotskyite " past and at the same time accused him of being more American than Greek . Then they made the relatively minor but damaging charge that Andreas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a friend . While stoutly denying the accusation , Andreas Papandreou last week resigned " for the sake of the Government " - and much the wiser in ways of Greek politics .
