" Promises and piecrust , " observed Dr. Swift , " are made to be broken . " By ignoring such cynicism , California 's Ronald Reagan risked a lot of pastry . During his election campaign , the new Republican Governor had pledged " sound financial management , " and last week had the crust to demand the highest budget ever proposed in any American state , buttressed by the biggest tax boost in California history . <P> To keep the state moving ahead and at the same time in the black , Reagan proposed a budget of $5,047,000,000 and called for $946 million in increased taxes . The tax figure was deceptive , however , because a sizable chunk of it ( $170 million ) would go toward offsetting property taxes ; on the average , homeowners would receive about 6.5% relief from property tax bills . <P> To raise the new revenues , Reagan proposed a 5% sales tax ( up from 4% ) , increases in liquor taxes from $1.50 per gallon to $2.25 , in cigarette taxes from 3 to 6 , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10% , and in bank and corporate profits from a maximum of 9.5% to 10.5% . Actually , the new taxes were necessary mainly because the state was committed by former Governor Pat Brown to programs costing far more than current taxes are bringing in . If approved by the legislature , they will become effective July 1 , and under the California constitution , revenue must equal expenses . <P> Though the action did little to raise the onetime actor 's popularity rating , he at least knew how to recognize an exit cue . When his tax proposals were made public , Reagan managed a strategic retreat to the East , where he met with New York 's Governor Nelson Rockefeller , breakfasted in Washington with Republican members of the House , and swapped quips with Bobby Kennedy at the Gridiron Club 's annual hijinks . <P> Reagan , 56 , who spent three days in the capital , was exposed to the intense attention Washingtonians accord only to those whom they regard as potential presidential candidates-though he persistently denied any intent of running in 1968 . At a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wit , gave his views on subjects ranging from Viet Nam ( " full resources " should be used to support U.S. troops there ) to whether Michigan 's Governor George Romney should take a position on the war ( " It sure would help him at press conferences " ) . Items : <P> &gt;On the possible use of nuclear weapons in Viet Nam , conceding that he is not equipped to decide the issue , Reagan observed : " The last person in the world that should be told we wo n't use them is the enemy in Viet Nam . They ought to go to bed every night thinking we will . " <P> &gt; On open housing : " There are certain fundamental rights that can not be put up to vote , " and one of them is the right of a homeowner to sell his property to whomever he wants . <P> &gt; On student revolts : " You do n't negotiate with student groups . You listen to what they have to say . But if they do n't abide by the rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seek their education elsewhere . "
