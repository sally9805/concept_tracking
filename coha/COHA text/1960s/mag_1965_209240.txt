RHODESIA <P> To an outsider , the 250,000 whites of Rhodesia would seem to have little need to declare independence from Britain . They seem happy enough as they are . The climate is marvelous , the soil fertile , the servants plentiful and the commerce thriving-thanks largely to Commonwealth tariff protection for their goods . Moreover , since Britain has allowed them a free hand in governing themselves since 1923 , Rhodesians have no trouble whatsoever in keeping firm control over the colony 's 4,000,000 blacks , only 60,000 of whom are even eligible to vote . <P> All this is not enough . With independent black nations swarming into the U.N . and the Commonwealth , and the possibility of racial unrest spreading southward across the Zambezi , Rhodesia 's whites have become increasingly militant . They are concerned that some time or other , Britain will make them live up to their colonial constitution-which , in theory at least , guarantees eventual African majority rule . Their new militancy is personified by Prime Minister Ian Smith , who came to power 18 months ago on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Ever since , he has claimed that to protect this principle Rhodesia must have its complete freedom . If Britain would not grant it , then he would take it-in a unilateral declaration of independence . <P> Tommies or Tobacco ? Last week-barring an outright threat of war from Prime Minister Harold Wilson-a declaration of independence seemed right around the corner . Following a week of talks with Wilson in London , Smith held a 95-minute press conference at which he declared that Wilson refused to " negotiate " independence on Rhodesia 's terms , and therefore " we have to face up to the alternative , which is U.D.I. " What Wilson wanted from Smith was a specific , concrete timetable toward total African enfranchisement . What he got was a promise that a sovereign Rhodesia would grant blacks their rights some time within " 15 to 50 years , " depending , that is , " on how responsible the Africans were . " <P> That , in turn , was not enough for Wilson . He warned Smith of " unmentionable and highly dangerous consequences " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his bluff . He was banking heavily on the probability that although some voices in Britain were calling for British troops , a vast segment of British public opinion would protest the use of tommies to put down an Anglo-Saxon insurrection ( Britain has not gone in for that sort of thing since 1776 ) . Instead , what seemed to lie ahead was economic reprisals : the freezing of Rhodesia 's sterling deposits , ejection from the Commonwealth and its tariff protection , trade boycotts or embargoes . All of which did not seem to bother former Finance Minister Smith . Indeed , despite the vulnerability of Rhodesia 's $50-million-a-year tobacco trade with Britain , it was an open question as to how successful sanctions would be , though both the U.S. and West Germany told Smith they would cooperate with Britain . As one letter writer to the Rhodesia Herald pointed out : " History is one of the few guides that we have . A look at all past threats of sanctions by the League of Nations and the United Nations shows that they have proved remarkably ineffective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
