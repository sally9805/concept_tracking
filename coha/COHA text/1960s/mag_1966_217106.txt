Time after time in the past decade , the Supreme Court has held that discrimination by private individuals is not forbidden by the U.S. Constitution . But how to distinguish between private acts and public responsibility ? Last week the court tried again to deal with the question and stirred up almost as much controversy as it settled . <P> When U.S. Senator Augustus Octavius Bacon died in 1914 , he left 100 acres to his home town of Macon , Ga. , as a park " for the sole , perpetual and unending use of the white women , white girls , white boys and white children of Macon . " Half a century later , an expanding Constitution upset Bacon 's plans . Macon 's white citizens realized that the city could no longer administer the park and continue discrimination . Negroes were admitted , only to have the park 's trustees sue , claiming Bacon 's will had been violated . The city decided to remove itself as trustee of the park . Private trustees were appointed , and the action was approved in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the U.S. Supreme Court . <P> " Plainly Public . " There , last week , by a 6-3 vote , the switch of trustees was deemed inadequate to qualify the park as private . If a person left a school or center for the use of one race only , and in no way implicated the state in its supervision , wrote Justice William O. Douglas for the majority , there would be no constitutional trouble . " This park , however , is in a different posture . From the pleadings we assume it was swept , manicured , watered and maintained by the city as a public facility for whites only . We only hold that where the tradition of municipal control had become firmly established , we can not take judicial notice that the mere substitution of trustees instantly transferred this park from the public to the private sector . " <P> Clear enough . But Douglas went on to say more : " This conclusion is buttressed by the nature of the service rendered the community by a park . The service rendered even by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " As opposed to golf clubs , social centers , schools and other like organizations , " a park is more like a fire department or police department that traditionally serves the community . Mass recreation through the use of parks is plainly in the public domain . " <P> " Amorphous &; Far-Reaching . " To Justice John Harlan , the last part of Douglas ' argument was dubious . " This decision is more the product of human impulses , which I fully share , than of solid constitutional thinking , " he said in dissent . He argued that the " public function " of privately established schools and privately established parks is clearly similar . If the majority thought that its decision left " unaffected the traditional view that the 14th Amendment does not compel private schools to adapt their admission policies to its requirements , " said Harlan , he did not agree . He found it difficult " to avoid the conclusion that this decision opens the door to reversal of these basic constitutional concepts . The example of schools is , I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public function ' theory ... a catch phrase as vague and amorphous as it is far-reaching . "
