In the four months since France began boycotting the meetings of the European Economic Community , a feeling of gloom has spread over the Continent . Sensing that Charles de Gaulle wants to reshape the Common Market into his own instrument-or , failing that , to destroy it-France 's five EEC partners have vacillated between despair and resistance . The result : an almost total lack of meaningful activity in the Market . Last week , in a swift and surprising reversal of form , the five ended their hesitation . At a two-day meeting at the Common Market 's Brussels headquarters , they finally stood up to Charles de Gaulle , laid down firm but polite terms aimed at coaxing the French back to the fold . <P> Offering Bait . First off , the five partners-West Germany , Italy , Belgium , The Netherlands and Luxembourg-agreed substantially on a complicated method of financing agricultural subsidies inside the Common Market , the problem that led to the French walkout . They also dropped some proposals that De Gaulle opposes , such as one to give more power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EEC executive commission . As bait for the French , the five offered to hold one ministerial meeting without the commission 's Eurocrats , whom De Gaulle dislikes because their supranational leanings conflict with his dream of French hegemony over Europe . <P> The EEC members balked , however , at going all the way with the French . They brushed aside French proposals to 1 ) permanently curtail the commission 's powers , 2 ) settle the current dispute between France and the five outside EEC 's structure , and 3 ) alter the treaty creating the Common Market so that France will not automatically lose its power to veto Common Market decisions , as it is scheduled to do in January . <P> Pinch Hitter . Much of the credit for the common stand against De Gaulle 's pressures belonged to a diplomatic pinch hitter , soft-spoken Italian Treasury Minister Emilio Colombo , who presided over the Brussels meeting in place of ailing Amintore Fanfani , Italy 's Foreign Minister . After quietly sounding out each delegate , Colombo dramatically produced a proposal while the ministers , fortified with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a secluded forest home outside the Belgian capital . Thanks to their agreement , said EEC Commission President Walter Hallstein , " the Community is alive . " The sole French reaction in public : Foreign Minister Couve de Murville 's cool and correct acknowledgement that the invitation to rejoin the EEC meetings had been received .
