txt Robert Moses , president of the World 's Fair Corporation , said yesterday that " if I know anything about the fair 's finances , " the city would not get ; back any of the S24 million it advanced for permanent improvements , n making the fair site ready . He said also that because of the fair 's financial difficulties , there would not be enough of a surplus at the end of the fair , to finance the permanent chain of parks planned for the Flush- , ing Meadow site . And , at City Hall , Abraham D. Beanie , City Controller , said ; that under authority vested in ; his office he Was sending hisl own auditors to the fair next : week to study the fair 's books.1 " I would appreciate it if you ! would cooperate with me in ; such an audit , " Mr. Beanie wrote Mr. Moses . He said he , would go to court if Mr. Moses ' did not cooperate . Yesterday the fair held its annual joint meeting of directors and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Pay Notes Mr. Moses told the meeting ; in a written report that " we ' intend to pay our noteholders ' in full . " He also promised " a ' brighter , more stimulating " edid tion of the fair , which reopens April 21 . But , despite announcement of ; some changes and improve-1 ments at the fair , it was the financial situation that domi- ; natal yesterdays meeting , ! which lasted eight minutes and , was over almost before those . participating realized it had begun : Thomas J. Deegan Jr. , chairman of the fair 's executive committee , told the meeting that the executive committeel had met earlier in the morning and accepted the resignation of five bankers from the fair 's finance committee . The bankers resigned on Jan. 18 because they said that they had not been given sufficient audited information on the nancial state of the fair , Mr. Deegan said also that the executive committee hadI approved a plan whereby the : fair would try to borrow up ' to $4 million on short-term notes to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned after the : meeting that the fair would seek this loan in 10 days from regular commercial banks . Audited Report Due By that date , according to Mr , Moses , the fair will have received an audited report from ' Peat , Marwick , Mitchell &; Co. ' auditors . It will also , accord- ' ing to another source , have a new and sharply trimmed budg- , et for the 1965 season . Mr. Moses said the fair anticipated no difficulty in raising the needed money . " I already have an offer , " he : told reporters , " but I 'm not telling you who it is from . " The only unexpected incident at the meeting , at which all the fair 's officers were re-elected , came when Senator Jacob K. Javits rose and asked Deegan what the mechanics were for calling a special meeting of the board of directors . He was told that it could be called by Mr. Moses , Mr , Deean or by any 50 of the 100 directf , rs of the corporation . Senator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George S. Moore , president of the First National City Bank arid one of ; ; the bankers who resigned from I the fair 's finance committee . I A spokesman for the Sena tor said that Mr. Javits had ; asked for the information be- , cause " a special meeting may ' be necessary unless we gets ! answers we need on these fi-I nancial matters . " I " The Senator wanted to have , the mechanics of the thing in ; ; mind , " he added . In addition to Mr. Moore , who ; ! was chairman of the advisory group , the bankers who resigned were William S. Renchard , pres ; . ident of the Chemical Bank New York Trust Company ; David Rockefeller , president of the ! Chase Manhattan Sank ; W.H. Moore , chairman of the Bankers : Trust Company , and D. E. Sharp , vice president of the ! Morgan Guaranty Trust Com ' pany. $71 Million Spent 1 Pending the audited statement , the fair corporation told ; its directors yesterday that it ! had spent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these expenditures was , 527,045,769.50 paid for contract services involving mainly the maintenance and policing of the fairgrounds . The second largest item was the $7,457,250 spent by the fair in August for a 25 per cent prepayment of its 6 per cent notes . Mr. Moses has said this prepay- , ment is responsible for the fair 's ' present financial difficulties . " It was a mistake and a mistake in which we all ? including the finance committee  --  participated , " Mr. Moses said . When Mr. Moses was asked about reports that City Council ! members had called for an investigation of the fair 's finances , Ihe replied : " Well that 's characteristic of Council members , They 're trying to get their names in the paper . " At a session with reporters after yesterday 's meeting , Mr. ; Moses became testy on several ; occasions . He said that the ' bankers had resigned from the ' finance committee because they had been misinformed . " Was it you who misinformed them ? " he was asked . " What the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Mr. Moses snapped . He advised the reporters to settle down and " have a drink . " Mr. Moses said that he felt that the increase in the adult admission fee to the fair from ; $2 to 82.50 would not affect the attendance at the fair . He said that he based this view on experience and cited the case of Jones Beach , where , in the face of his own dissent , Thomas E. Dewey , then the Governor , ordered a price increase . " The attendance went up at Jones Beach , " Mr. Moses said , In his letter to Mr. Moses , City Controller Beame said : " I believe it to be in the best interest of the city as well as of the fair that my office undertake an audit of your books and records , so that I can be in a better position to evaluate the certified statements , which I expect from you next month . " Mr. Beanie cited a section of the New York City Charter under which the Controller has the duty and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the finances of the city . . . and for such purpose he shall have power to require the attendance and examine and take the testimony under oath of such persons as he may deem necessary . " He said that Samuel Shafran of the Controller 's Staff would be in touch with Irwin Witte , the fair 's controller " within a week . " At yesterday 's - City Council meeting , a motion to investigate , the fair 's finances was blocked on a technicality , - a development that angered Councilman Paul O'Dwyer , a Manhattan Democrat . " How long will we permit Mr. Moses to tax the patience of the city taxpayers who have been imposed upon and hoodwinked ? " Mr. O'Dwyer said after the meeting . " A full and complete investigation might - salvage some of the taxpayers ' money and perhaps bring peace to the warring faction on the board of directors of the fair . " At the meeting of the fair 's ; ; directors , some of the plans for ; the 1965 season were disclosed . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and directors , it has been ; learned , is now in doubt . Exhibit in Doubt The members and directors were told that the Hallmark Foundation was to take over ' the building known as the ' Pavilion , which was used for special events at the fair .

" including a special 15-minute film about Sir Winston , a col- , lection of his paintings , a reproduction of his . library study , at Chartwell and an exhibition of memorabilia of his life . Information concerning the new exhibit was distributed to the directors and members yesterday . But the fair 's officials said yesterday that the exhibit was now in doubt . An official at Hallmark said that plans were now being held up because of Mr. Churchill 's death and pending the wishes of his family .
