My grandfather , Charles Schweitzer , had never taken himself for a writer , but the French language still filled him with wonder at the age of seventy because he had had a hard time learning it and it did not quite belong to him . He played with it , took pleasure in the words , loved to pronounce them , and his relentless diction did not spare a single syllable . When he had time , his pen would arrange them in bouquets . He was only too ready to shed luster on family and academic events by works written for the occasion. * While my grandmother and my mother and I were in Arcachon during the summer , my grandfather would write to us three times a week , two pages for his wife Louise , a postscript for his daughter Anne-Marie , and a whole letter in verse for me . In order to make me fully aware of my good fortune , my mother learned and taught me the rules of prosody . Someone taught me to scribble out a versified reply . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The two women sent off , the letter * Jean-Paul Sartre 's maternal grandfather , the son of an Alsatian schoolteacher , was a scholar and a teacher of German . On the Sartre side , Jean-Paul was the son of a young naval officer who died during the baby 's first year ( 1905 ) . He grew up in his grandfather 's household .

I received by return mail a poem to my glory ; I replied with a poem . The habit was formed . I asked for and was given a notebook and a bottle of purple ink . I inscribed on the cover : Novel Notebook . The first story I completed was entitled " For aolRutterfly .

This cold-blooded plagiarism freed me from misgivings ; everything was necessarily true since I invented nothing . I did not aspire to be published , but I had contrived to be printed in advance , and I did not pen a line that was not guaranteed by my model . I was never completely taken in by this " automatic writing . " But I also enjoyed the game for its own sake . Being an only child , I could play it by myself . Now and then , I would stop writing . I would pretend to hesitate ; I would pucker my brow , assume a moonstruck expression , so as to feel I was a writer . Other writers , Boussenard and Jules Verne , for example , did not miss an opportunity to be on the monuments of Aurillac , enough to fill a thin volume that would be edited by former pupils .

For the first time , I was dealing with the patriarch . He seemed forbidding and all the more venerable in that he had forgotten to adore me . He was Moses dictating the new law . My law . He had mentioned my vocation only in order to point out its disadvantages . I concluded that he took it for granted . Had he predicted that my pages would be drenched with tears or that I would roll on the rug , my bourgeois restraint would have been shocked . Ile convinced me of my vocation by giving me to understand that such showy disorders were not in store for me : in order to discuss Aurillac or pedagogy , there was no need , alas , of fever or tumult . Others would heave the immortal sobs of the twentieth century . I resigned myself to never being thunder or lightning ; I would shine in literature by virtue of my domestic qualities , my amiability , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an adult activity , so ponderously serious , so trifling , and , at bottom , so lacking in interest that I did n't doubt for a moment that it was in store for me . I said to myself both , " That 's all it is. " and . " I 'm gifted . " Like all dreamers , I confused disenchantment with truth . It 's true that I 'm not a gifted writer . I 've been told so , I 've been called labored . So / am ; my books reek of sweat and effort ; 1 grant that they stink in the nostrils of our aristocrats . I 've often written them against myself , which means against everybody , * with an intentness of mind that has ended by becoming high blood pressure . My commandments were sewn into my skin ; if I go a day without writing , the scar burns me ; if I write too easily , it also burns me .

That 's due to the nature of the Word : one speaks in one 's own language , one writes in a foreign language . I conclude from this that we 're all alike in our profession : we 're all galley slaves , we 're all tattooed . Besides , the reader has realized that I loathe my childhood and whatever has survived of it . I would n't listen to my grandfather 's voice , that recorded voice which Be self-indulgent , and those who are also self-indulgent will like you .

At the source of this was a discovery , or rather a reminiscence , for I had had a foreboding of it two years earlier : great writers are akin to knights errant in that both elicit passionate signs of gratitude . If only a writer lived long enough , he invariably ended by receiving a letter from an unknown person who thanked him . From then on , thanks kept pouring in ; they piled up on his desk , cluttered his home . In themselves , these gratifications did not interest me ; they reminded me too much of the family play-acting . There was , however , a certain drawing that staggered me : the famous novelist Dickens is going to land in New York in a few hours ; the ship on which he is sailing can be seen in the distance ; the crowd is gathered on the pier to welcome him ; it opens all its mouths and waves a thousand caps ; it is so dense that children are suffocating ; yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depopulated by the mere absence of the man for whom it is waiting . I murmured , " There 's someone missing here . It 's Dickens ! " And my eyes filled with tears . " So it 's true , " I said to myself , " they 're needed ! " But then . . . what about me ? Me , whose mission it was to write ? Well , they were waiting for me . I , the imaginary child , was becoming a true paladin whose exploits would be real books . I was being summoned ! People were awaiting my work , the first volume of which , despite my zeal , would not come out before 1935 , Perhaps I was already being missed in certain places . But no , it was too soon . I was the bright object of a desire that was still unborn , and I gladly consented to remain incognito for a while . At times , my grandmother would take me with her to her circulating library , and it would amuse me to see tall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in search of the author who would satisfy them . He was not to be found , since he was I , that youngster who was standing under their very noses and whom they did n't even look at . I sharpened my talent , well and good . But what purpose would it serve ? Human beings needed me ? to do what ? I had the misfortune to question 110 THE AUTHOR AS HERO , MARTYR " Not at all . Do you think that the great works are born of flowing pens ? " " Lord , since I 'm such a nonentity , how could I write a book ? " " By buckling down to it . " " Does that mean anyone can write ? " " Anyone . But you 're the one I 've chosen . " This faking was very convenient . It enabled me to proclaim my insignificance and at the same time to venerate in myself the author of future masterpieces .

I would become a public enemy : I would be insulted by the local papers ; shopkeepers would refuse to serve me ; fanatics would throw stones at my windows ; I would have to flee in order to escape being lynched . The story had two endings ; I would choose one or the other , depending on my mood . When I was feeling low , I would see myself dying on an iron cot , hated by everyone , desperate , in the very hour when Glory was blowing its trumpet . At other times , I would grant myself a bit of happiness , At the age of fifty , in order to try out a new pen , I would write my name on a manuscript , which shortly thereafter would be mislaid . Someone would find it , in an attic , in the gutter , in a closet of the house which I had just left . He would read it .

A hundred reporters would go looking for me and not find me . Recluse that I was , I would remain unaware for a long time of this sudden shift of opinion . Finally , one day , I enter a caf ? to come in out of the rain . I notice a newspaper lying nearby and what do I see ? " Jean-Paul Sartre , the masked writer , the bard of Aurillac , the poet of the sea . " On page three , a six-column spread in capitals . I rejoice . No ? I am voluptuously forlorn . In any case , I return home . With the help of my landlady , I tie up the trunk containing the notebooks and ship it to Fayard without giving my address . At this point in my story , I would pause in order to launch out into delicious schemes .

The Editors . , AND SAINT Before taking the train , I went back to the scenes of my childhood , the Rue Le Goff , the Rue SoufHot. the Luxembourg . I was attracted by the Cafe Balza ' ' , I remembered that my grandfather ? who had since died ? had sometimes taken me there in 1913 . We would sit side by side on the bench ; everyone would look at us knowingly ; he would order a glass of beer and a small one for me ; I felt I was loved . Now fifty years old and nostalgic , I pushed open the door of the cafe and asked for a small glass of beer . At the next table , some beautiful young women were talking animatedly ; my name was mentioned . " Ah ! " said one of them , " he may be old , he may be homely , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my life to become his wife ! " I looked at her with a proud , sad smile , she smiled back in surprise , I got up , I disappeared , Ispent a lot of time touching up that episode and a hundred others which I spare the reader . One can recognize , projected into a future world , my childhood itself , my situation , the concoctions of my sixth year , and the mopiness of my unappreciated paladins . I was still moping at the age of nine , and enjoying it immensely ? by moping , the inexorable martyr-that-I-was kept alive a misunderstanding which the Holy Ghost himself seemed to have tired of . Why not tell that ravishing admirer my name ? Ah , I would say to myself , she comes too late . But since she accepts me in any case ? Well , it 's because I 'm too poor . Too poor ? What about the royalties ? This objection did not faze me ; I had written to Fayard instructing him to distribute the money which was due me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the story . Well then , I would pass away in my little room , abandoned by all , but serene . Mission accomplished . I am struck by one thing in that oft-repeated story : the day I see my name in the paper , something snaps . I 'm finished ; I sadly enjoy my fame , but I stop writing . The two denouements come to the same thing : whether I die in order to be born to glory or whether glory comes first and kills me , the eagerness to write involves a refusal to live . I can see that , despite the bluffing and lying , the mad enterprise of writing in order to be forgiven for my existence had a certain reality . The proof is that I 'm still writing fifty years later . But if I go back to the origins . I see there a flight forward , a simpleminded kind of suicide . Yes . more than the epic , more than martyrdom , it was death that I was seeking . For a long time 112 THE AUTHOR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which to me were undecipherable . I could not get out of the hook . I had long since finished reading it , but I remained a character in it . I spied on myself . An hour before , I had chatted with my mother ; what had I augured ? I would remember some of my remarks ; I would repeat them aloud ; that got me nowhere . The sentences slipped by , impenetrable . To my own ears , my voice had a foreign ring ; a thieving angel was pirating my thoughts in my very head , and that angel was none other than a light-haired little boy of the thirty-first century who was sitting at a window and observing me through a book . With loving horror , I felt his gaze pinning me down in my century . I shammed for him ; I concocted double-edged remarks which I let fall in public . Anne-Marie would find me at my desk , scribbling away . She would say , " It 's so dark ! My little darling is ruining his eyes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 1 could write even in the dark . " She would laugh , would call me her little silly , would pot on the light ; the trick was done ; we were both unaware that I had just informed the year 3000 of my future infirmity . Yes , toward the end of my life , more blind than Beethoven was deaf , I would work gropingly on my last book . Faith , even when profound , is never entire . One must constantly prop it up , or at least refrain from ruining it . I was consecrated , illustrious . I had my tomb in Pere Lachaise Cemetery and perhaps in the Pantheon ; an avenue was named after me in Paris , as were public squares in the provinces and in foreign countries . Yet , at the core of my optimism I had a sneaking feeling that I lacked substance . At Saint Anne 's Psychiatric Clinic , a patient cried out in bed , " I 'm a prince ! Arrest the Grand Duke ! " Someone went up to him and whispered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he blew his nose . He was asked , " What 's your occupation ? " He answered quietly , " Shoemaker , " and started shouting again . 1 imagine that we 're all like that man , In any case , at the beginning of my ninth year , I resembled him ? I was a prince and a shoemaker . Two years later , I would have been considered cured . The prince had disappeared ; the shoemaker believed in nothing ; I had even stopped writing . The " novel notebooks " had been thrown out , mislaid , or burned and had made way for grammar , arithmetic , and dictation notebooks . If someone had crept into my head , which was open to all the winds , he would have come upon a fewbusts , a stray multiplication table , and the rule of three , thirty-two counties with the chief town of each but not the sub-prefecture , a rose called **27;2079;TOOLONG , some historical and literary monuments , a few polite maxims engraved on stelae , and sometimes , like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sadistic reverie . Not a single female orphan . No sign of a gallant knight . The words hero , martyr , and saint were not inscribed anywhere , not repeated by any voice . The former hero received satisfactory health reports every term : child of average intelligence , very well-behaved , not gifted for the exact sciences , imaginative but not excessively so , sensitive ; quite normal , despite a certain affectedness which , moreover , was on the wane . But 1 had gone completely mad . Two events , one public and the other private , were to blame . The first was a genuine surprise : in July 1914 , there were still a few evildoers ; but suddenly , on August 2 , virtue took over and reigned ; all Frenchmen became good . I was thrilled ; France was putting on an act for me , I put on an act for France . Yet the war soon bored me ; it upset my life so little that I probably would have forgotten about it , but I took a dislike to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My favorite publications disappeared from the newsstands ; Arnould Galopin , Jo Valle , and Jean de la Hire abandoned their favorite heroes ? those teenagers , my brothers , who went around the world in a biplane , in a seaplane , and who fought two or three against a hundred ; the prewar colonialist novels were replaced by war novels full of cabin boys , young Alsatians , regimental mascots . I detested those newcomers . I regarded the little adventurers in the jungle as child prodigies because they massacred natives , who , after all , were adults ; being a child prodigy myself , I recognized 114 THE AUTHOR AS HERO , MARTYR , AND SAINT to preserve my life from chance . I was of the Church . As a militant , I wanted to save myself by works ; as a mystic , I attempted to reveal the silence of being by a thwarted rustling of words , and , what was most important , I confused things with their names ? that amounts to believing . I saw everything wrung . As long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble . At the age of thirty , I executed the masterstroke of writing in Nausea ? quite sincerely , believe me ? about the bitter unjustified existence of my fellowmen , and of exonerating my own . I was Roquentin ; I used him to show , without complacency , the texture of my life . At the same time , I was I , the elect , chronicler of Hell , a glass-andsteel photomicroscope peering at my own protoplasmic juices . Later , I gaily demonstrated that man is impossible ; I was impossible myself and differed from the others only by the mandate to give expression to that impossibility , which was thereby transfigured and became my most personal possibility , the object of my mission , the springboard of my glory . 1 was a prisoner of that obvious contradiction , but I did not see it ? I saw the world through it . Fake to the marrow of my bones and hoodwinked , I joyfully wrote about our unhappy state . Dogmatic though I was , I doubted everything except that I was the elect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroyed with the other , and I regarded anxiety as the guarantee of my security ; I was happy . I have changed . I shall speak later on about the acids that corroded the distorting transparencies which enveloped me ; I shall tell when and how I served my apprenticeship to violence and discovered my ugliness ? which for a long time was my negative principle , the quicklime in which the wonderful child was dissolved . I shall also explain the reason why I came to think systematically against myself , to the extent of measuring the obvious truth of an idea by the displeasure it caused me . The retrospective illusion has been smashed to bits ; martyrdom , salvation , and immortality are falling to pieces ; the edifice is going to wrack and ruin ; I collared the Holy Ghost in the cellar and threw him out ; atheism is a cruel and long-range affair ? I think I 've carried it through .

I 've given up the office but not the frock : I still write . What else can I do ? Mak dies sine linea . It 's a habit , and besides , it 's my profession . For a long time , I took my pen for a sword ; I now know we 're powerless . No matter . I write and will keep writing books ; they 're needed ; all the same , they do serve some purpose . Culture does n't save anything or anyone , it does n't justify . But it 's a product of man : he projects himself into it . he recognizes himself in it : that critical mirror alone offers him his image . Moreover , that old , crumbling structure , my imposture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one does n't get cured of one 's self . Though they are worn out . blurred , humiliated , thrust aside , ignored , all of the child 's traits are still to be found in the quinquagenarian . Most of the time they lie low , they bide their time ; at the first moment of inattention , they rise up and emerge , disguised . I claim sincerely to be writing only for my time , but my present notoriety annoys me ; it 's not glory , since I 'm alive , and yet that 's enough to belie my old dreams ; could it be that I still harbor them secretly ? I have , I think , adapted them ; since I 've lost the chance of dying unknown , I sometimes flatter myself that I 'm being misunderstood in my lifetime . Let 's drop that . My grandmother would say , " Gently , mortals , be discreet . " What I like about my madness is that it has protected me from the very beginning against the charms of the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the happy possessor of a " talent " ; my sole concern has been to save myself ? nothing in my hands , nothing up my sleeve ? by work and faith . As a result , my pure choice did not raise me above anyone . Without equipment , without tools , I set all of me to work in order to save all of me . If I relegate impossible Salvation to the prop room , what remains ? A whole man , composed of all men and as good as all of them and no better than any .
