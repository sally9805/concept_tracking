Why do people stand in line when their chances of getting to see a hit movie or play are obviously hopeless ? <P> At Manhattan 's Metropolitan Opera House , legions of trusting souls regularly queue up hours before the box office opens to sell its small ration of tickets for a popular performance . The fans who stay up all night waiting to buy World Series tickets almost always exceed the modest supply . <P> Apparently , a particular kind of gambler 's delusion is involved in queueing . <P> Leon Mann , a social psychologist at Harvard , and K. F. Taylor of the University of Melbourne , report in the Jour nal of Personality and Social Psychology that people in lines are possessed of a curious sixth sense that subconsciously spots the " critical point " when the sup ply of tickets will give out . Yet instead of giving up and going home , late comers succumb to an ersatz optimism and delude themselves into thinking that the line is shorter than it really is . <P> Mann and Taylor discovered the existence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting in lines at sporting events or movie hous es . With uncanny precision , the research ers found , the mood of the queuers changed at the mysterious but universally recognizable dividing point . Ahead of it , people estimated the length of the line and their chances of success quite accurately ; often they would over estimate the number of people ahead of them as a pessimistic cushion against being disappointed . But just behind the point , people consistently underestimated the size of the crowd ahead of them . The latecomer , the researchers conclude , is one of a special , desperate breed . He is blessed - or cursed - with an automatic mechanism for justifying the folly of sticking around and for " reassuring himself that his prospects are still good . " The point in a line where pessimists shade into optimists , Mann and Taylor imply , is a good place for cooler heads to decide on quitting .
