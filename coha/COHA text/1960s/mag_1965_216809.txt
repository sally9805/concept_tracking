Mississippi 's Governor Paul Johnson , who can not run for re-election and thus has no need to court the segregationist vote , last month urged his state to comply with the new federal Voting Rights Act . In any event , warned the Governor , " any effort through the courts to obtain relief from this act is unlikely to succeed . " <P> Mississippi 's Attorney General Joe Patterson seems not to have been listening . Last week Patterson , who will be up for re-election in 1967 , went right ahead with a last-ditch legal fight against the voting law that seemed to be more a campaign gesture than anything else . Filing bills of complaint in chancery courts of four Mississippi counties now under federal registration supervision , he asked for injunctions permitting local officials to reject any voters-federally registered or not-who did not comply with state registration laws . Those laws , which were overwhelmingly approved in a statewide referendum this summer ( TIME , Aug. 27 ) , provide that no Mississippian is eligib'e to vote unless he can read and sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ federal law , which abolishes literacy tests and allows an " X " for a signature . <P> With predictably oblique logic , Patterson " argued that Mississippi 's laws " do not violate anyone 's rights under the 15th Amendment , which the Voting Rights Act is predicated and bottomed on " But what of the U.S. doctrine that federal law supersedes state law ? US Supreme Court has held many times , " said Patterson , " that there is no such thing as a federal elector . The only electors are those qualified in the individual states . We realize Congress has the right to protect individuals under the 15th Amendment . But we do n't concede it the right to write the election laws of the state of Mississippi . " <P> By week 's end state courts moved to grant Patterson 's requests for injunctions . But the Justice Department is fully prepared to take the case into the federal courts . There the last legal ditch will almost certainly be so deep that even the most intransigent Southerner will have to agree that Governor Johnson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
