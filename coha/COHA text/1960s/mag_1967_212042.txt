South Viet Nam 's runner-up candidate , Truong Dinh Dzu , has clearly enjoyed all the attention he has received since he came in an unexpected second to the Thieu-Ky ticket . Last week Dzu received some unwelcome attention . In a Saigon criminal court , where he failed to appear but was represented by two attorneys , he was found guilty by a civilian judge on charges of writing a bad check for $8,300 and transferring $11,500 from Viet Nam to a San Francisco bank in violation of the currency laws . The first charge carried a sentence of three months in jail and an $80 fine , the second six months plus a $27,600 fine . <P> Dzu , who has a somewhat unsavory reputation in Saigon , was indicted for the crimes well before he became a presidential candidate . The charges were revived after he announced his candidacy , but the court put off a trial until after the elections . Still , the summons to trial so soon after Dzu 's surprisingly good showing was regarded as a government attempt to cut Dzu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> The guilty verdicts came just a day after Dzu announced the formation of a " Fighting Front for Democracy " made up of six of the losing civilian candidates , who together had polled almost as many votes as Thieu and Ky . " We do not recognize the election , " proclaimed Dzu , " it was fraudulent . " If the Constituent Assembly validates the election , said Dzu , then " we shall fight in an orderly manner . " Dzu will likely be able to keep fighting for a long time , despite the judgments against him . He has a month to appeal the verdicts , then two more higher courts through which he may drag out further appeals .
