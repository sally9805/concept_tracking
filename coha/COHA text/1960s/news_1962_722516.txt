txt United States District Judge George Rosling ? extended for ten days yesterday his order barring a strike by Pan-American World Airways flight engineers . Judge Rosling announced the extension twenty minutes , before the strike was scheduled to start . The judge first issued the restraining order last Saturday and it was to have expired at 4 P. M. yesterday . When yesterday 's hearing opened , Judge Rosling announced that he had denied a motion to dismiss Pan-American 's action . The motion had been made by Daniel Kornblum , counsel for the Flight Engineers International Association . Just before the hearing recessed yesterday , Judge Rosling extended his order , prohibiting the strike until July 6 at 4 P. M. He also announced that a hearing on the application of the preliminary injunction would resume at 2 P. M. today . Review Is Sought Mr. Kornblum said he would seek an immediate review by the Court of Appeals of Judge Rosling 's extension of the restraining order . For more than an hour at yesterday 's hearing , Mr. Kornblum argued that the Railway Labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days in a labor dispute . The Railway Labor Act provides for only one " cooling off " period during a labor dispute . The Norris - La Guardia Act limits the power of the courts to issue injunctions and provides for panels to iron out disputes between labor and management . Mr. Kornblum also argued that another Federal judge had indicated that the engineers had a right to strike as far back as July 20 , 1961 . The engineers , he said , had voluntarily refrained from striking while special boards had been organized in an attempt to settle the dispute Serious Error Seen " The thirty-day cooling off period has elapsed , " Mr. Kornblum said . " This is a most serious error and against the whole pattern of the Railway Labor Act .. The right to strike has gone down the drain . " Interposing , Judge Rosling said his action was completely in accord with the Norris-La Guardia Act . But Mr. Kornblum insisted that Judge Rosling 's move had defeated the purpose of the act by extending the restraining order for ten days . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rosling said that when arguments began today he would hear Herbert Prashker , attorney for Pan - American World Airways , on the application for a temporary injunction . Meanwhile , Pan American // schedules yesterday , including about thirty-eight flights in and out of New York , as its 501:I flight engineers remained on the job . Ronald A. Brown , president of the Flight Engineers Association , said in Washington that his union would abide by the court 's order . Eastern Air Lines remained strikebound . Eastern closed down all operations after picketing began at 2 P. M. Saturday . There was still no word from Eastern 's management as to whether it would seek a nostrike order similar to Pan American 's . Pan American went into court Saturday , winning the restraining ' order that enabled it to resume flying within a matter of hours . Eastern said last night it would await the results of further court proceedings today in Pan American 's case to decide its course of action . Observers took Eastern 's statement to mean the airline was reluctant to resume flights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flight ' engineers and is the nation 's third largest airline . Its mainly domestic system handles about 30,000 passengers a day or 15 per cent of domestic air travel . Pan American , flying 15,000 passengers a day , accounts for about 70 per cent of United States scheduled international airline service . Both Eastern and Pan American are members of the airline industry 's mutual assistance agreement , under which eight lines guarantee payments of at least 25 per cent of a signatory line 's normal operating expenses . Eastern has estimated it is losing $1,000,000 a day in revenue from the strike . The flight engineer aids the pilot on large airliners by monitoring engine and other systems . He occupies  --  the so-called third seat . In 1958 , a number of airlines added a third pilot to jet crews , putting four men in the cockpit . The current disputes center on methods of reducing jet crews to three men . The airlines have been under demands from the pilots union since the jet age began to use three qualified pilots in jet planes . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to meet this demand , believing this might put them in the jurisdiction of the pilots union . They have sought guarantees against pilot absorption . The engineers contend that the pilots union would place them at the bottom of seniority lists in a : representation merger , where they would be the first to lose jobs in the event of technological lay-offs . Air Strike Bill Weighed Special to The New York Times . WASHINGTON , June 26 Senator A , S. Mike Monroney said today that he would introduce a bill to ban jurisdictional strikes on , airlines . The Oklahoma Democrat is chairman of the Senate Aviation Subcommittee . The Senator considers the issues that have led the Flight Engineers ' Union to strike Eastern Air Lines and threaten a strike against Pan American as essentially jurisdictional . Last week , they were successful in mediating a settlement of similar issues affecting the Flight Engineers on Trans World Airlines . ? The board 's finding could be appealed to the Federal courts . Strikes to enforce jurisdictional claims would be barred . The bill has not been drafted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduction .
