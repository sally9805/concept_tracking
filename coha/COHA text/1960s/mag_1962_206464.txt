GABRIELA , CLOVE AND CINNAMON ( 425 pp. ) - Jorge Amado-Knopf ( $5.95 ) . <P> <P> Old hands in the little Brazilian cacao port of Ilhus complain that the place has become overcivilized , and with reason . Take the matter of government . In the past , a sane , orderly rule was established and maintained in Ilhus by the most efficient of means : gunfire . Now , in the 1920s , there are modernists who say that gunfire is outdated ; the new method is the free election . Polls are rigged , of course , to ensure that power remains in the proper hands , but oldtimers see no merit in the innovation ; the elections are cumbersome and not at all entertaining . <P> There is also the serious matter of morality . In the old days a proper Brazilian wife stayed home , speaking only to the servants and to God . Now the town fathers are mortified ; a man can not walk home from a quiet evening at the brothel without seeing married women and their spineless husbands shamelessly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is all very disturbing . <P> With sly , leisurely humor , Novelist Amado records the stir made in Ilhus as the fitful-sometimes barely perceptible - winds of progress blow . There is nothing that is not affected by modernism . Everyone is full of admiration when Colonel Jesuino Mendonga , after discovering his wife and his dentist in conversation ( he in the nude , she wearing only a pair of long black stockings ) , shoots both of them . The colonel 's conduct was impeccable under the ancient code for settling marital differences , and even liberals in Ilhus are shocked when a court finds him guilty and sentences him to a jail term . <P> It does not take the reader long to realize that he is in the hands of a Brazilian Boccaccio ( whose book is marred now and then by his translators ' foolish fondness for gringo slang ) . It is no surprise , therefore , when Gabriela appears-the laughing , barefoot , round-rumped omnamorata who turns up in the bawdy literature of every language . Who is Gabriela 's husband ? Naturally he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nacib 's window when Nacib is tending bar ? No one but oily Tonico , the seducer . Will Tonico succeed in getting back out when Nacib comes home unexpectedly ? Ah , now there is a question to stir discussion in Ilhus , just as it has fascinated readers in its countless variants across the centuries .
