As anybody knows , a classic defense in cases of murder , rape and aggravated assault is insanity . But what about white-collar crimes like tax dodging ? <P> Two Manhattan defendants - who also happen to be lawyers - are now exploring that very point . And for the moment , Robert G. Sheller and Daniel G. Driscoll have beaten federal tax raps by pleading emotional upset . <P> When Lawyer Sheller , 59 , was tried on tax-evasion charges a year ago , his psychiatrist testified that he was " suffering from a psychotic reactive depression " when he reported only $9,000 of his $43,000 income in 1959 . In his instructions to the jury , the judge omitted insanity as a defense . New York federal judges then used the old M'Naghten test that a man is legally in sane only if he " did not know right from wrong " , or did not understand the nature of his acts at the time of his crime . A supplement to the M'Naghten test added " irresistible impulse " but neither test seemed to fit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for willful cheating . But while he was on bail appealing his six-month sentence , the U.S. Court of Appeals issued a key decision ( U.S. <P> v. Freeman ) ordering federal judges in New York , Connecticut and Vermont to use the American Law Institute 's new insanity test . By that test , " a person is not responsible for criminal conduct if at the time of such conduct , as a result of men tal disease or defect , he lacks substantial capacity either to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law . " Last month the same appellate court reversed Shelter 's conviction and ordered a new trial in which he can seek acquittal by reason of Freeman-style insanity . <P> Where this can lead is clear from the case of Lawyer Driscoll , 39 , one of Roy Cohn 's law partners , who was tried last month for having " willfully failed " to file any federal tax returns for three years in which he grossed $119,034 . <P> In fighting a possible three-year sentence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his psychiatrist , the lawyer had " morbid depressions " that inhibited him from finishing important work . Driscoll 's defense also brought forward 15 impressive character witnesses , including Louis Nichols , the FBI 's ex-No. 2 man and now executive vice president of Schenley Industries . They all testified to his good reputation . Driscoll got a hung jury : six jurors voted to convict , six to acquit for insanity . So he , too , may be retried . <P> What happens if Sheller and Driscoll are now actually acquitted under the Freeman standards ? In many state courts , such acquittal has a grim result : <P> automatic commitment to a mental institution . In Massachusetts , for example , a manslaughter defendant acquitted for insanity faces indeterminate commitment , often for life . And in the federal District of Columbia , Congress has passed a special law that would certainly commit allegedly insane tax evaders . <P> Off they would go to St. Elizabeths Hospital-perhaps indefinitely .                   @ @
