Into the West German mails this week went 3,500,000 copies of a 400-page catalogue that will set off a long-distance shopping spree in homes from Bremerhaven to Garmisch-Partenkirchen . The catalogue is the latest and fattest from Frankfurt 's Neckermann Mail Order House , offers Germans 5,500 items at prices as much as 40% lower than those of competing retail stores . This year , for the first time , the orders ( averaging nearly 40,000 a day ) will pour into a massive new steel and concrete headquarters now being taken over by the expanding firm . Built for Neckermann on a swamp on Frankfurt 's outskirts , the complex covers some ten city blocks , contains one of Europe 's largest buildings . <P> The man who will get more enjoyment than anyone out of the catalogue is hard-eyed , aggressive Joseph Neckermann , 47 , founder and sole owner of the company . <P> In ten years he has singlehandedly changed the buying habits of millions of Germans , made his firm into the biggest mail order house in West Germany by cutting prices and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of business . Today , Neckermann rules over an empire of 22 retail stores , 48 electrical appliance stores , 60 repair shops , more than 100 mobile repair units and 8,000 workers-and a 1959 gross of $132 million . All this has made Joseph Neckermann a millionaire : he lives in a 16-room Frankfurt mansion with his wife and three children , indulges his hobby of riding with a stable of prizewinners . To keep his empire humming , he works 12 hours a day , often sleeps on an office couch . <P> Cut-Rate Morality . Born in Wuerzburg , Neckermann started in business at 21 by buying a large lot of lamps and lampshades , assembling them himself , and selling them below the market price . Enraged competitors put him out of business by getting a court ruling that it was illegal to sell at cut-rate prices . Leaving Wuerzburg , Neckermann went off to Berlin . <P> There , as throughout Germany , hundreds of Jewish businessmen were being persecuted by the Nazis , forced to sell their businesses at ridiculously low prices to get enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cut rate-whatever the moral implications-Neckermann took advantage of the forced sales to buy the mail order house of Carl Joel . As a big supplier to the military , Neckermann was exempted from military duty when World War II began , became a Nazi well connected in party circles . At war 's end , the Allies sentenced him to a year 's imprisonment for failure to divest himself of his properties ; he caught tuberculosis in jail , went to a refugee camp to recover . <P> There Neckermann recognized the opportunity for a comeback in the huge market created by the influx of millions of refugees , who needed almost everything , were usually far from shopping centers . <P> In 1950 he scraped together $25,000 , sent out a crude , twelve-page catalogue of wearing apparel to 250,000 refugees picked from card indexes . His prices were aimed at the low-budget housewife-and the housewives liked what they got . Within eight months Neckermann was doing a $2.4 million a year business .                @ @ @ @ @
