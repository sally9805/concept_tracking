For more than a month , the action stirred by Rhodesia 's unilateral declaration of independence has centered in London and Salisbury . Last week the focus shifted to another capital : Lusaka , where Zambia 's moderate black African President Kenneth Kaunda was caught in an ever tightening bind . <P> As Rhodesia 's northern , black-ruled neighbor , Zambia is expected by other black-nationalist regimes in Africa to lead the fight against Ian Smith and his white-minority government . Kaunda certainly wants to defeat Rhodesia 's whites , but not in a racial war . He wants white troops to go into Rhodesia to bring down Smith . But Britain 's Prime Minister Harold Wilson is nowhere near ready to face the prospect of the Queen 's white British troops shooting Rhodesia 's white British troops . And Kaunda admits that if he asked for Russian help , he would stand a very good chance of being captured at the same time he was being rescued . <P> Sullen Twins . Then there are more immediate economic worries . Smith &; Co. have it in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut off electrical power in the rich Zambian copper fields around Ndola . Rhodesians control the turbines and generators of the giant Kariba Dam on the Zambezi River , which forms the border between the two countries . Completed in 1960 under the now defunct Central African Federation , Kariba supplies both Zambia and Rhodesia with power , ties them together like sullen Siamese twins . For two weeks Kaunda has demanded that Britain at least send troops to " neutralize " the Kariba power station on the Rhodesian side of the river , arguing that Smith 's soldiers would not fire on Britons if they marched across the dam . Harold Wilson is not so sure . <P> Instead , he offered to send a token force-a squadron of R.A.F. fighters and a battalion of the Royal Scots-to the copper belt , some 250 miles north of the dam . Kaunda accepted the air protection ( Zambia has only ten military aircraft of its own ) , but rejected the offer of troops unless they were sent directly to the dam . Into the copper-belt center of Ndola at week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by big-bellied Argosy and Beverley transports carrying the squadron 's maintenance supplies . A brace of Britannia turboprop transports arrived at Lusaka itself . To the south , Smith was sardonically amused . " It is in our interest to have law and order maintained in Zambia , " he deadpanned in a television interview . <P> Outlawed Stamp . Not quite so funny were the new economic sanctions that Wilson slapped on Rhodesia . In addition to the embargo on Rhodesian tobacco and sugar ( the nation 's major crops ) , Britain also banned imports of asbestos ( a $30 million export item last year ) , copper , lithium , chrome , iron , steel and meat . That made the embargo 95% complete . Simultaneously , Wilson ordered a halt to interest payments , dividends and pensions from Britain to Rhodesian residents , thus damming a flow of income that totaled some $25 million last year . He even outlawed Rhodesia 's bright new independence postal stamp as British postage . If Smith was scared , he was n't showing it : with rich , like-minded South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rhodesia 's trade to the south , thus easing the sting of the British embargo .
