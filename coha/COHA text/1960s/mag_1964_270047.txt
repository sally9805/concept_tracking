Nothing could sound more universal than the Style , or de Stijl as its Dutch founders dubbed it in 1917 . That was precisely what they wanted : a pure , pristine art that pierced beyond the world of appearances and individuals . In achieving it , de Stijl changed and unified the appearance of the world . <P> The staggered buildings of city planning , the glass boxes of much modern architecture , advertising layouts , type faces , furniture , all stem from the taste of de Stijl and other geometrically influenced art isms of the 20th century . Fundamentally , de Stijl 's hallmarks were 1 ) the right angle , 2 ) the primary colors ( red , blue and yellow ) , 3 ) asymmetrical composition . Since these rarely occur in nature , they are the closest to abstract art . <P> But the Dutch art movement , whose standard-bearer was Piet Mondrian , made more than rules for good design . It was a heavily Platonic philosophy of art , carried out in mighty Pythagorean paintings , that saw pure beauty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Abstract art is opposed to the raw primitive animal nature of man , but it is one with true human nature . " <P> Oddly , Mondrian 's art paralleled the rather raw expressionism of his countryman , Van Gogh , until he was 37 . Then , influenced by cubism , he began simplifying what he saw to horizontal and vertical lines . Flowering apple trees , building fronts , jetties into the sea soon dissolved into what he called " plus-and-minus " rhythms . He wrote that he was searching for a higher " reality detached from the transitory reality of forms . " <P> In 1916 Mondrian met Bart Van der Leek , whose work ( see opposite page ) , though sometimes representational , dealt with pure colors in flat planes . They tried to remove the traditional moat between the picture and the viewer . Mondrian 's late paintings can be seen as the visible imprint of an invisible pattern surrounding the viewer . Even the walls of his stark studio were hung with movable panels that he rearranged to suit his desire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Van der Leek used white in his work not as background but as space that separated his flecks of color , like atoms locked together in the Tinker Toy of their own energy . <P> Artists all over the Western world took constructive geometry as their guide through the 1920s and ' 30s . Even the names told the story : a Polish group called Blok , an international survey on the subject called Circle , the famed architecture school called Bauhaus . <P> Though Mondrian has been dead for two decades , the grip of de Stijl 's geometry has never lessened , as is demonstrated in the 80-odd paintings on show at Manhattan 's Marlborough-Gerson Gallery . Among the younger Dutch painters , Joost Baljeu , 39 , makes mechanical totems of an order beyond emotion . U.S. Artist Charles Biederman , 58 , saw that his mentor Mondrian had reached " the very limit permitted by the old hand medium of paint . " He lays down the brush for what he calls " the new art tools of man " - machines - and makes his metal reliefs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
