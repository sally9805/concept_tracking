That Household Word <P> Sir : Spiro Agnew is the voice of the silent majority , and , praise God , we are a thoughtful , frank and vibrant people , muted no more . <P> I feel a sense of selfdiscovery . <P> J. NICHOLAS KEIL <P> Los Angeles <P> Sir : Remember when Truman partisans used to interrupt his speeches with shouts of " Give ' em hell , Harry " ? <P> Now I , as a member of the now not-so-silent majority , am shouting " Sock it to ' em , Spiro ! " <P> WALKER CARLL <P> Shelbyville , Ind . <P> Sir : The Vice President 's speech assailing one of the most distinguished American statesmen of our time was given free , prime-time national television coverage . Irony of ironies ! <P> Mr. Agnew not only insulted Ambassador Harriman and the television news commentators but also , and with more subtle degradation , the intelligence of the American people . The Vice President 's lack of confidence in the ability of his constituency to make discerning and reliable judgments is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do the same . <P> NATALIE SOLFANELLI <P> Hyattsville , Md . <P> Sir : As I understand it . Spiro Agnew has decided that you ca n't expect objective news coverage from the dollar-minded mass media . <P> Is n't that just what those impudent snobs of the New Left have been trying to tell us all along ? <P> DICK HEMENWAY <P> Northford , Conn . <P> Sir : I seem to have lost my copy of 1984 . I hear that there is a man in Washington doing good imitations of Big Brother . Maybe he has it . <P> A. DROOKER <P> The Bronx , N.Y . <P> Sir : Belittle him as you will , he is the only American today who dares to articulate what most of us are thinking . I see nothing wrong with that-unless freedom of speech has become the exclusive property of television news commentators . <P> HAL GOULD <P> Washington , D.C. <P> Sir : Agnew is charged with the responsibility of defending and propagating American ideals in a world of violence and Communist conspiracy . I believe he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his command-words . That he uses them so effectively is to his everlasting credit . <P> ELMER R. SEABERG <P> Guilford , Conn . <P> Sir : President Johnson 's failure to reconcile candor with public statement came to be known as the credibility gap . Spiro Agnew has developed his own brand of un-believability-the incredibility gap . <P> SHEILA COLOZZI <P> Nashville , Tenn . <P> Sir : When you put Spiro Agnew down too hard you are doing so to an enormous segment of America . What the Vice President is saying is also being said over coffee and back fences by the people who pay taxes and perform the unglamorous and sometimes lowly services . <P> TONI MEYER <P> Cincinnati <P> Sir : You bigoted snots , pig-headed slobs and outraged snobs disgust as much as our V.P. delights . Hope my man Agnew turns his big guns on you despicably biased hacks next . <P> ( MRS . ) MARY C. NELSON <P> Jamesville , Va . <P> Sir : Many of us could wish that we had a more polished Vice President , but I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any amount of polish without it . <P> HOWARD HAYES <P> Elizabethton , Tenn . <P> Sir : In the matter of the Vice President 's alleged IQ of 135-we demand a recount . <P> ROBERT E.
