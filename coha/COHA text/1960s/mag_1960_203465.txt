The compass , the chronometer , the sextant gradually changed navigation from an art to a science , made mere curiosities of such seafaring geniuses as the early Polynesians-who , according to legend , could smell land far beyond the horizon and head their boats accordingly . In 1960 , man 's most accurate substitute for weather-dependent celestial navigation is World War II 's loran ( for long-range aid to navigation ) , a system of cross-monitored radio signals that is highly expensive and covers only the more frequently traveled parts of the earth . Last week loran seemed destined for obsolescence , as an experimental Navy satellite called Transit I-B blasted into space from Florida 's Cape Canaveral . <P> Transit I-B ( an attempt to send Transit I-A into orbit failed last September ) is only the first basic step in a process that is expected to take two years to develop . Many of the first press stories excitedly treated it as though it were already an operational system . It is not-however dramatic its promise for the future . <P> By Doppler Effect . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slanted around the world from 51 N. to 51 S. and settled into an elliptical orbit ( apogee , 475 miles ; perigee , 235 miles ) , sending radio signals from the moment it left the pad . From Texas to Hampshire , England , tracking stations sent information to a computing center near Washington , D.C. In future models , orbit-predicting data will be quickly rebroadcast to the satellite , which will remember its daily itinerary on magnetic tape , constantly announce it from space ( the day-to-day orbital variations are minuscule , but would be vital to navigators ) . <P> The key to the navigation system is a common phenomenon first articulated scientifically little more than 100 years ago , when Austrian Physicist Johann Christian Doppler noted that sound waves coming from a moving object increase in frequency as the source of the sound approaches an observer , decrease as it moves away . Thus , in what has become the standard example of the Doppler effect , a train whistle seems to rise and fall in pitch as the train goes by . Similarly , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearer to a receiver on earth , diminish as they move on . By measuring the rate of change of these frequencies , a navigator can determine his exact distance from the satellite 's path . And since Transit will also announce just where it will be on its path at any given moment , a computer on shipboard will be able to tell the navigator where he is . <P> Scrounged Parts . Only one satellite is needed for an accurate navigational fix , but when the Navy 's system is operational in 1962 , four satellites will crisscross in a synchronization planned to serve all quarters of the earth . The advantage to commercial shipping will be slight , since present methods are more than adequate . But the military significance is great , may solve the major problem of missile shots from submarines : determining the exact distance and direction from the sub to the target . Cruising underwater far off the beaten track and out of loran 's range , a nuclear submarine will be able to poke a whip antenna above the surface , take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with lethal accuracy .
