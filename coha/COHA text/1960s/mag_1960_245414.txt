After having set the U.S. high school world aflutter last year with his well-reasoned criticisms , former Harvard President James B. Conant last week took on Education in the Junior High School Years ( Educational Testing Service ; 50 ) . Addressed to school boards , Conant 's new study is a " purposely conservative " pamphlet of 46 pages-the work of a critic who spurs progress by shunning polemics . <P> Transition . In visiting 237 schools in 23 states , Conant found wide disagreement over where to fit grades 7-9 in a school system . Some communities keep grades 7 and 8 in elementary school , some plump for a six-year high school , and still others hold that the separate three-year junior high school gives combustible half-adolescents a chance to grow at their own pace . In reality , says Conant , the junior high often becomes " a replica of the senior high school with its attendant social pressures . " Hitting hard at pretentious commencements , big-time football and marching bands that " serve merely as public entertainment , " Conant snorts that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason . " <P> <P> What interests Conant is effective schooling in these baffling grades , not organizational juggling . Academically , he prescribes sanely taught solids ( 60% to 70% of classroom time ) , aimed at preparing youngsters aged 12 to 15 for their biggest hurdle-transition from the " child-centered " elementary school to the subject-centered high school . For Conant 's money , the key solid is reading . " Pupils will not succeed in high school . " he comments dryly , ' ' unless they can read at least at the sixth-grade level ... To my mind , the minimum goal for almost all pupils at the end of grade 9 is that these future voters should be able to read with comprehension the front page of a newspaper at a rate of about 200 words a minute . " <P> <P> Time for Mastery . Toward fancy new ideas , from teaching machines to team teaching , Conant has a show-me attitude . His 14 recommendations are designed to make many schools catch up with the old ideas . Items : <P> <P> Arithmetic should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very able ( 3% to 5% nationally ) should begin algebra in the eighth grade in order to tackle college math in the twelfth grade . Science should be a fulltime subject beginning in the-seventh grade . Biology ( now usually taught in tenth grade ) might well begin in ninth grade-but only if lab facilities can be provided . Foreign language should begin in seventh grade for " some , if not all , pupils . " But the school must follow through with continuing instruction in the same language through twelfth grade . Homework should increase from one hour a day in seventh grade to two hours in ninth grade . But it should be " meaningful " homework , carefully explained in advance , and not mere " drudgery . " Since " mastery of basic skills " is the task at hand , the unskilled should repeat grades . But because of the " social and psychological problems involved with overage pupils , " Conant suggests that no child repeat more than two years in the first eight grades .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
