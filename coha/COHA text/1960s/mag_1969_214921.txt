The bride wore nothing . Neither did the groom or , for that matter , the officiating cleric , a minister of the religious-diploma mill known as the Universal Life Church , Inc . ( TIME , Feb . <P> 21 ) . The ceremony was as stark as the apparel . Dropping a stick before the cou ple , the pastor pronounced the legal essentials in mod vernacular : " You 're married , as long as you dig it . " <P> For all its bizarre exhibitionism last month 's wedding of Carol Lee Garrett and James J. Kimmel in a hippie commune near Novato , Calif. , was indicative , if not exactly typical , of a current trend in marriages . More and more couples are breaking away from traditional mar riage ceremonies to invent their own . <P> The stylized forms and archaic symbolism of the past appear increasingly ir relevant to some people , who nonetheless feel the need for some form of religious sanction for their love . <P> In Order and Chaos . " Elizabethan is a foreign language to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atlanta , speaking of couples who want to re write the service in their own phrase ology . Dr. B. Davie Napier , dean of the chapel at Stanford University , ad mits that he has become " increasingly uneasy with a ceremony that does n't speak to us now . " In one recent wedding ceremony performed by Dean Napier , the bridegroom vowed to take his wife " for better for worse , for richer for poorer , in sickness and in health , in war and in peace , in order and in chaos , now and forever .

Foley planned their Roman Catholic wedding in Milwaukee , they altered the traditional ceremony to give it an interracial , ecumenical character " for our friends who were black , white , Jew , Catholic , Protestant , poor , middle class and rich . " <P> Shannon explains : " We wanted them to feel they were a part of our mar riage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided not to have a nuptial Mass. * <P> Instead , the whole assembly read " On Love " from Kahlil Gibran 's The Prophet . The Epistle and Gospel were read by Jewish and Jesuit friends respectively . <P> Other readings were from Dietrich Bonhoeffer , the anti-Nazi Protestant martyr and theologian , and John F. Kennedy . <P> When China Altman and George Blakely Rogers married recently in Boston , they accepted the offer of an old friend to be their " paraclete , " or special adviser and supporter of their union . Half a dozen lines were written into the Unitarian ceremony , formally requesting the friend to accept his uncommon role . " Many young people no longer look to their parents for assistance and advice , " explains China . " To do so is often too emotionally complicated . We look instead to our best friends . To have a friend promise to be the paraclete of your marriage makes all kinds of sense . "                   @ @
