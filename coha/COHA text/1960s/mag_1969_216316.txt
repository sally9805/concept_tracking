Is the Western world stumbling toward another gold and monetary upheaval ? An increasing number of bankers and economists fear that it is . " The international monetary situation is still unstable , " says President Karl Blessing of the West German Bundesbank . South African Finance Minister Nicolaas Diederichs has repeatedly predicted that an international flareup will come in the second quarter of this year . Princeton Professor Fritz Machlup , a top expert on global finance , expects a new currency crisis " in the foreseeable future . " <P> Such worries have been reinforced by signs of strain in the world 's monetary system . Eight hours after Treasury Secretary David Kennedy was sworn in last week , he talked down one source of uneasiness . In a statement approved by President Nixon , he ruled out any change in the official $35-per-oz. price of gold . " We see no need or reason for such action , " he said . <P> A Preference for Metal . It was a ritual pledge , made in response to urgent requests by European bankers to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gold had been creeping up for more than a month , partly because of tensions in the Middle East and partly because Kennedy inadvertently raised hopes in December that the new Administration might raise the official gold price . Mindful of Nixon 's orders to avoid taking policy positions before the inaugural , Kennedy replied to a question about gold prices by saying that he would " keep all options open . " Despite disclaimers by Nixon 's press aide , speculators caught the scent of possible quick profits . <P> Two weeks ago , the free-market price in London and Zurich climbed to $42.75 per oz . That was the highest in the ten months since a buying panic forced central bankers to adopt a two-price system and stop supporting the price of privately traded gold at $35 . After Kennedy 's declaration last week , the free-market price retreated to $42 . <P> Still , the 20% gap between the different prices revived skepticism about the durability of the " two-tier " price system . In last year 's gold rush , the $3 billion that drained out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the free market . Now that cushion is depleted because speculators have bought it up . If the price gap grows larger , the central bankers of smaller nations might be tempted to unload official stocks of gold at the much higher free-market price-thereby circumventing the two-tier arrangement . <P> The two-tier system has worked well so far , but its future is imperiled by a fundamental defect . When central bankers decided to let the marketplace set the price of gold for speculators , hoarders and industrial users , they also agreed to stop buying and selling the metal except to settle debts among nations . Thus the world 's monetary gold stocks were artificially frozen at $40 billion . But nations ' appetites for gold have grown stronger , and their trust in paper currencies has become weaker . In the past year , these countries have changed the percentages of gold ( as against paper money and credits ) in their national reserves in the following way : <P> 1967 1968 Belgium 57% 63% Portugal 57% 64% Italy 44% 52% Switzerland 87% 90%     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
