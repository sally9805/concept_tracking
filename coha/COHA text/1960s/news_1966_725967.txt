txt A United Hospital Fund official said last night that voluntary hospitals were going deeply into debt because of inadequate and delayed reimbursement from Medicare and Medicaid . " They 're all in trouble right now , " the official said . " The payments are n't enough , and they 're not getting paid . " The situation came to light as St. Vincent 's Hospital in Greenwich Village borrowed more than $2-million from banks to pay vendors who supply food and equipment . " Twenty-five per cent of our patients are now out of Blue Cross or private insurance or the self-pay category , and have become Medicare patients , " sa*.d a statement issued by Sister Anthony Marie , the hospital administrator . " Another large segment of our patients are covered by Medicaid . " Medicare is a Federal program of reimbursement for medical costs of those 65 and over , and Medicaid is a Federalstate program for reimbursement for those of any age unable to pay their medical bills . As an economy measure , the 825-bed hospital has reduced a 50 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and nonprofessional personnel . The reduction will become effective Jan. 1 . The reduction will still provide evening or night employes with an approximate 30 per cent premium in addition to the salary they would receive for working during the day . According to Sister Anthony Marie , the reduced differential Is markedly higher than the premium pay late workers received before last April . And , she added , it is considerably above what is being paid in other hospitals and in industry . " It was absolutely necessary for us to reduce our costs in order to continue operation , " Sister Anthony Marie said . " The alternative was to close down patient floors and let employes go , or to reduce the very generous premium pay for evening and night personnel . We decided on the latter course of action . " Albert Samis , assistant administrator , said that the Medicare program reimbursed the hospital $47 a day for each patient served before Oct. 1 , when the rate was increased to $51 . He said that the actual cost to the hospital was $63 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 HOSPITAL DEBTS MOUNTING IN CITY // burled the hospital on the basis of an 8 per cent increase since 1964 , whereas costs have actually increased 20 per cent . " We are also caught in the dilemma of delayed payments by all agencies despite the fact that the payroll for over 2,000 employes comes around with inexorable regularity , " Sister Anthony Marie said . " Between $3-million and $4-million is owed us for services rendered , anytime from one day to one year ago . " A spokesman for the Social Security Administration , which administers the Medicare program , said that hospitals were reimbursed for actual costs . She added that delays in payment were common , but were frequently created by the hospital 's delay in sending in bills . Grant Adams , executive director of the United Hospital Fund , noted yesterday that " there has been a longstanding difference betwen hospital officials and Medicare officials on hospital costs . " Dr. James G. Haughton , the city 's First Deputy Health Services Administrator , who administers the city 's Medicaid program , said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their last audited bill , for a six-month period , totaling a 640 per cent advance . He said that the city also paid on a cost basis . Sister Anthony Marie said that the night differential was awarded on the basis of expectHi revenues from Medicare and Medicaid . " In view of the promised cost reimbursement , we set a high premium pay for evening and night workers , " she said in the statement . " In nursing alone , this increased the staffing for these shifts from 45 nurses to 135 . " Explaining what the reduced differential would mean to an individual in terms of dollars , a hospital official last night cited the hypothetical case of a nurse who received $550 a month base pay before last April 's changes . Before April , the official said , the nurse might have received $50 premium pay for night work . Between April and Jan. 1 , 1967 , she would get $225 extra or 50 per cent of her base salary , and , under the new plan , she would receive an extra $165 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new plan , according to Sister Anthony Marie , will save the hospital several hundred thousand dollars . A hospital spokesman said that there had been no resignations since the staff was informed last week of the reduction in night differential . However , one hospital worker expressed bitterness in a letter to The Times . " We feel the initial increase was a manipulative action on the part of the hospital to receive the badly needed night and evening personnel . The majority of us will be greatly affected by this cutback since we have adjusted our budgets to include certain things that were impossible before , such a better living facilities . In the case of myself and several of my co-workers , we have finally resumed our college education . " The hospital has an annual budget of $.4-million , and a $2.3-million deficit . " If this happened in any other industry , there would have been a layoff , " a hospital spokesman said . " We do n't want to layoff anyone . "            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
