As white and Negro Freedom Riders continued their rolling assault against segregation last week , they produced some profound results in South and North alike : <P> <P> In Washington , Attorney General Robert Kennedy urged the Interstate Commerce Commission to start enforcing the vaguely worded federal ban on segregation in restaurants , waiting rooms and toilets at interstate bus terminals . The ICC in 1955 outlawed segregated seating in interstate buses . But that rule is rarely obeyed in the South , and the ICC has acted against only one offending bus line , which was fined $100 . <P> In Chicago , Greyhound Bus Lines said that it will enforce non-segregation in its stations throughout the land . Two signs were promptly removed from entrances to two separate waiting rooms in the Greyhound station at Montgomery , Ala . One sign had read , " Colored Intrastate Passengers . " and the other , " White Intrastate Passengers . " The Trailways bus system said that it had also agreed to a policy of non-segregation . And whites and Negroes ate peacefully side by side at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week before , eleven Freedom Riders had been jailed for trying to do the same thing . <P> In Jackson . Miss. , the number of Freedom Riders held on breach of peace charges swelled to 53-most of the 13 whites in the city jail , most of the 40 Negroes in the county jail across the street . As the Freedom Riders spent the time praying , singing and discussing the philosophy of peaceful resistance , Jackson officials strove to present a picture of sweet reasonableness , gladhanded the visiting press at frequent parties . At week 's end , the jailed Freedom Riders began a hunger strike . <P> In Montgomery . Ala. , U.S. District Judge Frank M. Johnson Jr .. a native Alabaman , cracked down hard on both sides . He issued a temporary order restraining four Freedom Rider organizations and five Negro ministers ( including Martin Luther King Jr. ) from " sponsoring , financing , assisting or encouraging " any future test rides . At the same time , heeding a Justice Department request , he ordered the Montgomery police to protect Freedom Riders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Klanners from trying to halt or maul the riders . Warned the judge : " If there are any such incidents as this mob violence again , I am going to put some Klansmen , some city officials , some city policemen and some Negro preachers in the federal penitentiary . " The riders were unmoved . Said Dr. King : " Certainly the Freedom Rides will continue . "
