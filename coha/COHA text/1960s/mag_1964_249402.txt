A month before the Wisconsin presidential primary , Democratic Governor John Reynolds knew he had trouble on his hands . That was when Reynolds , running as a favorite-son front man for President Johnson , heard that Alabama 's Segregationist Governor George Wallace had filed against him . Reynolds promptly canceled a junket to Europe , flew to Washington for advice from Administration leaders , returned home to campaign for all he was worth . As the voting neared , he predicted that Wallace would get no more than 100,000 votes-but even that " would be a catastrophe . " <P> By that standard , the outcome of last week 's Wisconsin Democratic primary was worse than catastrophic . Reynolds won handily enough , collecting 511,000 votes . But Wallace made an astonishing show with 264,000 . In the Republican primary an unopposed favorite son , U.S. Representative John Byrnes , got 301,000 votes . <P> The Crossover . National Democratic leaders were quick to blame Wallace 's showing on Republicans who , they claimed , had crossed party lines in droves to vote for Wallace in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reynolds knew better . Said he in a postprimary statement : " All that Mr. Wallace has demonstrated is what we 've known all along . We have a lot of people who are prejudiced . " Politically inept as that remark may have been , Reynolds had a point . The real issue in the primary was civil rights . Wallace had entered the Wisconsin primary to demonstrate that many Northern , as well as Southern , whites are unhappy about current civil rights trends . And he demonstrated just that - dramatically . <P> To be sure , Republicans did cross over-as they are permitted to do under Wisconsin primary laws and as Democrats do when their own primary offers no contest . But there were indications that nearly as many Republicans last week jumped party lines to vote for Reynolds as for Wallace . For example , John Byrnes ' home district is heavily Republican , went for him by 63% in 1962 and is likely to do so again in his campaign for re-election to Congress this year . But in the presidential primary , Byrnes got only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wallace . The clear implication was that thousands of Republicans , spotting a chance to express themselves on a key issue , cast Democratic ballots and split more or less evenly on civil rights . <P> The Fears . Alabama 's Wallace actually ran strongest in Democratic districts heavily populated by lower-middle-class , second-generation Poles , Italians and Serbs . These voters obviously were apprehensive that the Negro drive for equality would harm their own economic interests . Thus , in southside Milwaukee , and in comparable districts in Racine and Kenosha , Wallace won majorities . In the newly created Ninth District , which includes Milwaukee 's northshore suburbs , there was a different story with the same ending . The Ninth is generally Republican , boasts Wisconsin 's highest per-capita income level . But the district is also rimmed by Negro neighborhoods . And last week Republican Byrnes took only 25% of the Ninth 's vote , while Reynolds got 28% and Wallace made a killing with 47% . That result could only be read as a protest against the threat of Negro incursions into a white district . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
