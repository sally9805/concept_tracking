Bolivia 's President Victor Paz Estenssoro , 57 , lives on top of a volcano . In his three terms of office since 1952 , he has made so many political enemies that he is a virtual prisoner of his bodyguards . He dares not leave the country for fear of a revolution , and he spends so much time keeping order in his bleak and violent Andean nation that he can not really concentrate on the basic economic problems that cry for attention . <P> Last week his volcano blew skyhigh . <P> Preaching Hatred . The warning rumbles have been growing ever since the May election in which Paz won another four-year term over the bitter opposition of two erstwhile allies : former President Hernn Siles Zuazo , 50 , and Juan Lechin , 51 , leftist boss of Bolivia 's tin miners . Siles has been packed off to exile in Uruguay . But Lechin is still around , preaching hatred and focusing Paz 's opposition . <P> Fortnight ago , in Cochabamba , Bolivia 's second biggest city , either police or pro-Paz campesinos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the youths . That was all it took to trigger an open revolt by students , miners and agitators of every stripe . In mining centers , union radios crackled with calls for " popular rebellion " against " the bloody tyrant and assassin Paz Estenssoro . " Lechin 's well-armed miners fought pitched battles with government troops , and the first casualty reports told of some 50 dead . <P> <P> In towns throughout the country , howling student mobs stormed through the streets , fighting police and-as always-attacking U.S. property . In the capital , La Paz , 600 students holed up in the university , for three hours exchanged rifle and submachine-gun fire with police . That it ended when it did was due to the courage of Monsignor Andrew Kennedy , 50 , U.S.-born Vicar-General of La Paz . " Students ! " the police shouted . " Stop firing ! Listen to Monsignor Kennedy ! " With two doctors , the stubby , grey-haired clergyman marched through the firing line and into the university . There he found 16 wounded , one dead . Finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off to jail . <P> Crucial Pivot . President Paz accused Communist Czechoslovakia of playing a major role in the riots , claimed evidence that the tin miners had been " armed with weapons made in Czechoslovakia . " Denouncing " this interference in Bolivia 's internal affairs , " Paz immediately broke all relations and ordered the Czech diplomats home . <P> For Paz , the crucial pivot that keeps him in or out of power will be the Bolivian army and his own armed followers . So long as they remain loyal , Paz will probably weather the storm . It is in the best interest of the hemisphere that he do so . He is an able economist of considerable vision ; he has a deep appreciation of inter-American relations and the U.S. role in Latin American development . And he is probably the only man strong enough to hold together his seething land .
