In Tony Rome , Frank Sinatra appears as a private eye for the first time . That fact may be of some interest to members of his immediate family , and the film may appeal to boosters of Miami Beach , which has seldom sparkled so prettily as it does here in Panavision-DeLuxe . Others are likely to find the movie nothing more than a blatantly inept , uncredited remake of Humphrey Bogart 's 1946 The Big Sleep . <P> That Sinatra is no Bogart is hardly news . What is more to the point is that neither Screen Writer Richard Breen nor Director Gordon Douglas affords him much opportunity to be Sinatra , an attractive enough role under proper auspices . Instead , he sleepwalks through the baroque entanglements of a plot involving a millionaire 's daughter in hot water , some jewelry stolen and forged , and a veritable menagerie of dope addicts , lesbian strippers , crooked nightclub owners , exasperated cops and good-hearted lushes . <P> The film also stops now and then to ogle gratuitous and unfunny sight gags , like Sinatra asleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remains one of Hollywood 's major mysteries why a performer who puts so much style into his records so often sabotages his genuine talents in shoddy and ill-chosen movie vehicles .
