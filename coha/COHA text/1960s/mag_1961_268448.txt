No form of frustration , no kind of rage , can compare to the feelings of a Manhattanite stuck in traffic . He taps his feet , pounds his fist against the windowpane , vows to move to Colorado , and wishes he could jump out of his conveyance with a ray gun , cutting a deadly path through the surrounding metal wilderness of trucks , buses and cars . Ray guns , so far , are out ; but there is an escape machine that a small , hardy band of New Yorkers are using to beat the traffic nightmare : the bicycle . <P> Manhattan bike riders find that they can snake easily through the traffic snarls , making their way through narrow openings where not even a Volkswagen could pass . Some cyclists are frightened by their first experience of heavy traffic , but , says Allen Bragdon , a publishing executive who pedals to work with an attache case strapped to his bike , " it 's really quite safe . Everyone thinks , ' Look at that fool on the bike . Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the riders a strong sense of independence . " You 're a free agent , " says Bragdon . " It 's a gesture of self-determination . I meet lots of people and our friendship lasts for about 20 blocks . It 's a microcosm of the city . " <P> Phyllis Shaw , a writer for an IBM house organ , Business Machine , finds city cycling enough of an oddity to provoke curiosity and generate sympathy .

" All he said was ' I 'm glad you came back . I have to catch a train , but I was afraid that someone would steal your bike . ' " At the movies , she adds , " I usually put it where the person in the box office can see it . She 's delighted to keep an eye on it . " A motorcycle cop once gave Sweater Designer Pamela Colin a personal escort as she wove through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rack . George Franklin Jr. , executive director of the nonpartisan Council on Foreign Relations , even pedals in dinner clothes . And Textile Designer George Roper takes his bike up in the elevator of his office building . <P> Doormen , however , look on the riders with disdain ; and sometimes , owning a bicycle in Manhattan is as frustrating as owning a car . A short time ago , Theater Owner Daniel Talbot came downtown from his apartment for lunch at the Algonquin Hotel . The hotel refused to let him park his bike in the lobby , a policeman told him to get it off the sidewalk , a garage attendant would not let him park in his lot even if he paid regular prices . He moved on .
