txt Lawarci N. Costikyan was " unanimously " re-elected Democratic leader of New York County yesterday by a voice vote taken while all of his reform opponents were out of the room . The way in which the vote was taken , combined with an already existing sense of injury felt by many reform leaders , appeared to have ended any immediate prospect of uniting the party in Manhattan . " In effect , we 're going back to the days when the reformers were completely outside the party organization , " one reform leader said . " Cooperation with Mr. Costikyan will be difficult . " Democratic district leaders of the regular faction , and two or three from the reform wing , provided a clear majority for Mr. Costikyan at a meeting of the county executive committee in the Chatham Hotel , at 33 East 48th Street . The reformers had planned to abstain from voting , knowing that Mr. Costikyan had the support of Mayor Wagner and the regular majority . However , the meeting was convened while the reformers were still at a caucus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , Mr. Costikyan had been re-elected and Mrs. Charlotte Spiegel , a regular leader , had been named chairman of the executive committee . Reform leaders later agreed with Mr. Costikyan that at east three messengers from the county leader had informed the caucus that the meeting was ' under way . Nevertheless , the procedure led one reform leader to accuse Mr. Costikyan of " De Sapio tactics . " The reference was to Carmine G. De Sapio , the former county leader , whom most reformers look upon as a political boss . Another reform leader said he hoped Mr. Costikyan 's actions did not indicate " a Caligula-like lapse into megalomania . " Comment by Costikyan Mr. Costikyan said he had assumed the reformers were absent during the vote " because they did not care to vote , for or against , or to abstain . " Several reform leaders arrived at the meeting yesterday in dark moods , following a series of defeats Thursday night at a meeting of the full 3.385-member county committee . The reformers failed to win any of 11 test votes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground that they had offered him a compromise that would have avoided most , if not all , of the test votes . In addition to several minor details , the reformers wanted to see Jean J. P. Baltzell , one of the veterans of their movement , re-elected treasurer of the county committee , and to block a rules change that would deprive them of about 500 county committee members in 1965 . They said efforts at a compromise had failed because Mr. Costikyan demanded in return that they support him . Mr , Costikyan denied that . He said he had asked the reformers only to make the final vote for county leader a unanimous one , after they had voted against him or abstained from voting , " simply as a gesture of party unity . " At the meeting Thursday night , the reformers were defeated on six questions involving rules changes and five contests for minor party offices . Mr. Baltzell was defeated for treasurer by Harvey Spear , an active party fund-raiser . Compromise Sought " I tried to bring about a compromise , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooperate . " He added that three weeks of negotiation to avoid a showdown at the county meeting had produced no results . After yesterday 's meeting , 18 reform leaders signed a statement saying that they were not disagreeing with the Mayor , and adding that " at most , we have a possible difference of opinion " with Mr. Costikyan . However , four other reform leaders refused to sign the statement on the ground that it was " not strong enough .
