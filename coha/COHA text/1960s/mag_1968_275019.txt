In an unprecedented flurry of daring surgery , four human hearts were transplanted last week : two in Europe , two in the U.S. , bringing the world total of such operations to ten . <P> <P> PARIS <P> French surgeons had to wait for months-not only for a suitable donor and recipient but also for their government to decide when a dead man is dead . At last the Cabinet ruled that a donor is dead when his electroencephalogram ( brainwave recording ) has shown no activity and he has had no reflexes for several hours . Scarcely was this decision taken when Donor Michel Gyppaz , 23 , died of head injuries at Paris ' ancient , crumbling Hopital de la Pitie . <P> <P> The recipient was Truck Driver Clovis Roblain , 66 , forced to retire last July by progressive heart failure and a crippling heart attack . Chief surgeon was Dr. Christian Cabrol , 42 , on the faculty of the University of Paris since age 26 , and a specialist in artificial-heart research . An hour after the operation , Roblain 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to near normal , but Roblain remained in a coma until his death 51 hours after the operation . The autopsy showed that many formerly immobile blood clots , set free by the unwontedly strong pumping action of the new heart , had traveled to his lungs and blocked circulation there . <P> <P> STANFORD <P> Joseph Rizor , 40 , a carpenter from Salinas , Calif. , became the second heart-transplant subject for Stanford University 's pioneering Dr. Norman E. Shumway Jr . The victim of three heart attacks within seven years , Rizor had been longing for a transplant since he heard of Dr. Christiaan N. Barnard 's first operation in Cape Town last December . " At first , " says his wife Eileen , " I was shocked by the idea . But time and the knowledge of how desperately my husband wanted the operation made me realize that it might be his only chance to live . " When a brain-injured donor , a man of 43 , died in Stanford Medical Center , Shumway implanted the heart in a 41-hour operation . ( The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) <P> Although Rizor had the advantage of relative youth , his long-standing heart disease had impaired his lung function , and after the operation he still needed artificial respiration , by way of an oxygen tube cut into his windpipe . Rizor 's new heart was doing a fine job of pumping more blood , but the blood was not taking up enough oxygen . Explained Shumway : " This change in circulation has confused his lungs to some extent . The problem is whether there can be a satisfactory adjustment to the new heart . Liver and kidney functions are fine-in other words , all systems are ' go ' except for the lungs . " <P> <P> HOUSTON <P> Everett C. Thomas , 47 , a Phoenix , Ariz. , accountant , was in St. Luke 's Episcopal Hospital in Houston waiting for Dr. Denton A. Cooley to replace three valves in his heart , all damaged by rheumatic fever beginning 15 years ago . A donor heart became available after Kathleen Martin , 15 , shot herself in the head during a quarrel with her 18-year-old husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her in 1962 because a narrowing of her aorta was restricting the outflow from her heart , which was becoming enlarged to meet its extra work load .
