txt Letters pg . 258 Letters TEEN-AGE SEX AND MARRIAGE To THE EDITOR : I have just read with interest the article by Ruth and Edward Brecher , " Every Sixth Teen-Age Girl in Connecticut ? " ( May 29 ) , and sadly note the reiteration of timeworn adult schemes to bring our youth into line . The crux of the argument comes at this point Does having intercourse prior to marriage endanger that institution ? I think it can , and does , as shown in the vast majority of divorce proceedings . An investment is involved in marriage ; it requires , perhaps for the first time , giving up of some freedom . The relinquishing of freedom is done in order to gain love , pleasure and security . Extramarital intercourse is not condoned by our youth , and yet that is exactly the case when sex is indulged in. prior to marriage . Pleasure is obtained so easily and at no apparent cost , there is no responsibility . Yet , once married , with the stresses and strains that always occur , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yesteryear and premarital intercourse , with no responsibility  --  a state which lasts only for the moment Control b desirable in building a marriage , for every act defines us , whether we Like it or not , and we are responsible . This is the communication I think we should try to make with young people ; perhaps then we will at least both be speaking the same language . HENRY B. SCHOENBERGER , M.D. Staff Physician , University Health Services , University of Massachusetts . Amherst , Mass . ? To THE EDITOR : Those parents anxious to preserve their children 's chastity would do well to realize that training for this virtue begins in infancy , coincident with general character formation . A teen-age boy experiences a sudden and urgent sex drive ; a young girl discovers a deep desire for affection and approval from the opposite sex . Such teen-agers will not be inclined or able effectively to channel these needs unless they already have achieved a degree of self-discipline , a modicum of =selfishness and concern for others , some old-fashioned fortitude , and , above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing up in an atmosphere of acceptance and love .

DILLON . Somerset , N. J. ? To THE EDITOR : As a senior in high school ( and a parochial high school at that ) I 've watched the furor of doubt , questioning , and indecision grow rampant among my friends . Though their questions seem to grow sharper with repetition , the answers , even now , are becoming more vague and more insincere . Few are the adults who practice or even believe what they preach . If they are asked directly about how they resolved their own questions in their day , they seem disinclined to talk ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet they become absolutely scandalized by the 15-year-old who hovers between homosexuality and masturbation as the only solution she found to a problem that her elders wo n't even grace with their opinions . They 'll undoubtedly refer to her as that " poor sick girl " or blandly remark , " My little girl is so different . " They are wrong . Only those who 've locked themselves out of society by barricading their doors with research books or religion remain unaware of or untouched by these problems . I , personally , do n't believe that open discussions on sex will suffice . Too often the flowery oration heard from a pulpit on Sunday morning Is inspiring  --  that is until Sunday night when you happen to find yourself at that wild party , or even the chaperoned party with the boy next door .

SWEDEN 'S DEFENSE To THE EDITOR : I could not read your most interesting article on civil defense in Sweden ( " Sweden Goes Underground " , by Oliver Clausen , May 22 ) , without wondering why the Swedes are willing to go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack while so little is being done in this country . The contrast is made clear when we compare the money spent on this protection . Your article indicates that Sweden , a nation whose population is only 7.7 million , has spent between $1- and $2-billion . The Russians , too , have been spending on civil defense at an annual rate of between $0.5-and $1.5-billion . These figures are to be contrasted to the United States , with its 195 million people , spending only $0.1-billion annually since about 1983 . Is it possible that the United States has reason to believe that a civil defense shelter program would not be effective ? The hearings held by the House Armed Services Committee of the U.S. Congress in 1963 lead to the conclusion that " on conservative assumptions , 25 to 65 million lives would be saved by providing reasonable protection against radiation fallout ( in the event of nuclear attack ) . " A study set up ; by the National Academy of Sciences called " Project Harbor " under the direction of Prof. Eugene Wigner of Princeton found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could protect the lives of 80 per cent of the U.S. population against an antipopulation attack of 3,000 MT . " This 80 ? per . cent would , of course , be reduced under a less-than-maximum effort or a larger attack . It might be increased with intensive research . Why , then , have we failed to provide shelters in the United States ? Your article quotes King Gustav VI Adolf as stating , " Sweden intends to defend itself , can defend itself , and is going to defend itself . We shall never surrender . Any report that resistance will cease is false . " Apparently we are not willing to complete our defense so that we can say this . Perhaps we need the infusion of a little Swedish blood in our veins . A. A. BROYLES , Professor of Physics and Physical Sciences , University of Florida . Gainesville , Fla.
