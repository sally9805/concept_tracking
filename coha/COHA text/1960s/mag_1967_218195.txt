Not since 1578 , when Sir Francis Drake sacked Cadiz and sailed away with 3,000 casks of the rich , golden drink , have Spanish vintners been so outraged by British treatment of their proudest export - sherry . In London 's Royal Courts of Justice , Spanish and British wine merchants are arguing a question that , depending on who loses , could sour a big business . The question : <P> Who can call a sherry a sherry ? <P> The plaintiffs , four British sherry producers , are demanding that they not be enjoined from using the word " sherry " on their labels The defendants , Pedro Domecq , Gonzalez Byass ( Tio Pepe ) and two other Spanish sherrymakers , argue that true sherry comes only from the vineyards around the Spanish town of Jerez . Since " sherry " is merely a corruption of " Jerez , " they say , it ought to be reserved for the Jerez product , just as British courts have reserved the name " champagne " for France 's Champagne district . <P> The Spaniards are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $1.30 to $2.50 a bottle , compared with $2 to $4 ) have taken over half of the large and lucrative British market , which the Jerez product once had all to itself . The low-price sip , sniff the Spaniards , is far inferior . Some of it comes from vineyards in South Africa , Australia and Cyprus . Some is made in Britain from imported grape juice , which is processed and sold under such labels as " British Sherry " and " South African Sherry . " <P> The British claim that the name is no one 's private property and that the non-Spanish brands are clearly so identified . Not always , objected the Spaniards , who hauled out a cartoon ad for " British Sherry " in which a matador shouts " Magnifico ! " " Why a matador rather than a Devonshire lassie ? " one judge asked . " The character in this cartoon , " explained a man from Whiteways Cyder , one of the plaintiffs , " was misguided . " <P> All in all , enough lawyers , linguists and wine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into March , bring court costs alone to around $280,000 . Before long , the judges may well be ready to settle the when-is-sherry-sherry question on the expert and well-aged testimony of Falstaff , who defined " a good Sherris-sack " as a brew that " ascends me into the brain , dries me there all the foolish and dull and crudy vapours which environ it ; makes it apprehensive , quick , forgetive.
