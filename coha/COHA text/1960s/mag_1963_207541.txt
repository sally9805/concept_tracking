Come Fly with Me is one of those Three Girls in ( fill in your favorite place ) genre pictures , and this time the words to fill in are " the wild blue yonder . " Pamela Tiffin , Dolores Hart and Lois Nettleton are the stewardesses aboard a transatlantic jet , and their avowed purpose is to promote dates , affairs or weddings with the pilots and the passengers . Dolores is the wild one who zeroes in on a baron with a flashy gold cigarette case ; Lois is blue because she is " over 30 " and unwed ; and Pamela is a way-out innocent on a collision course for the plane 's cleft-chinned pilot ( Hugh O'Brian ) . Paris , Vienna and picturesque Idlewild furnish the backdrops . <P> The dialogue is out of some high school play . Lois reacts to the news that her Texas boy friend ( Karl Maiden ) has $40 million by saying : " All us girls have our price . " Dolores does not care if the baron is really an international jewel thief who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because I happen to be in love with you . " And when Pamela stomps into the cockpit to tell Pilot O'Brian that " there are plenty of other men in the world , " he probably would have slugged her if he had not been busy driving the plane . <P> The screenplay for Come Fly with Me is the work of William Roberts . He deserves the season 's Joe Miller Award for being mostest with the fustiest.
