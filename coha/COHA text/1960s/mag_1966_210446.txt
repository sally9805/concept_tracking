" As I looked at the potential senatorial candidates , I saw no one prepared to speak for the national interest . " The words were those of a reluctant candidate in a state primary election , but they expressed a national need . And on this basis Oregon Congressman Robert B. Duncan , 45 , decided to run in last week 's Democratic primary to choose a candidate to fill Maurine Neuberger 's U.S. Senate seat . The election thus came as close as any so far to being a referendum on the Viet Nam war . <P> In supporting the Johnson Administration 's Viet Nam position , Duncan restated some pretty plain truths . He pointed out that U.S. policy since the end of World War II has been the containment of Communism . " We 're not out to police the world , " he said . " We did nothing in Tibet or Hungary , but we are now in a critical stage for the free world . This is a period of overall strife . Although some people describe Viet Nam as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a whole . " <P> Hot &; Cold . The nominal primary opposition was Howard Morgan , 52 , former Democratic state chairman and an outright critic of the U.S. war effort . But in making the race , Duncan was also taking on Oregon 's Senator Wayne Morse , the Administration 's most virulent Viet Nam foe , and Oregon 's Governor Mark Hatfield , the Republican candidate for the Neuberger Senate seat and a hot-and-cold-running critic of the war . To Morse , the war is " immoral and illegal . " To Hatfield , the Administration 's policies are bringing " neither victory nor solution . " <P> As in any election , there was not just one issue ; Duncan had other things going for him . A vibrant , crew-cut lawyer , he has put himself over as a colorful , forceful fellow during his two terms in Congress . A former seaman , he still enjoys a pinch of chewing tobacco , proudly wears Duncan tartan ties . He often reminds himself of appointments by jotting notations on the palm of his hand ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ) , keeps on scrawling right up his arm when his schedule gets really busy . Morgan , a wealthy cattle rancher and construction executive who was a Kennedy appointee to the Federal Power Commission , seemed drab by comparison . <P> Hardly Overjoyed . Though maintaining a prudent distance , the Johnson Administration made no secret of its preference for Duncan . And when Oregonians went to the polls , the President sweated out the results at the White House until 3 a.m . He went to bed pleased . In a victory of almost 2-to-l proportions ( 159,097 to 88,473 ) , Duncan plainly demonstrated that supporting the war can be a political asset .
