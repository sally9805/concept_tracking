txt I felt the fear in East Berlin . It is an eerie city under siege . I saw communist troops armed police , and tanks . But I saw only a few civilians and they scurried about like frightened animals . It seemed like a scene from one of those movies about the last days of the world . Police State at ' Work On a 90 minute taxi ride thru East Berlin today , I saw a police state at work . My West Berlin cab rolled up to the Brandenburg gate , one of the gaudiest doors in the iron curtain . " Where are you going ? " snapped an East German border guard . The cab driver opened his mouth to answer when he heard something go " whoosh . . . swiss . . . whoosh . . . " A few feet away East German police had turned a water can non on western news photographers . " Where are you going ? " asked the Red guard again . Sea of Armed Men My cabbie wanted no trouble . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ministry , " he lied . The guard looked into the cab 's trunk and let us pass . The taxi rolled into a sea of armed men . About 2,000 " peoples police " and " workers militiamen " were posted on the communist side of the Brandenburg gate . Five Russian T-34 tanks , manned by East Germans , sat like giant toads . We rode into Unter ? den Linden . Militiamen swarmed over the sidewalks and roadways and blocked our path . " Ca n't you move aside ? " my cabbie asked one formation . " You shut your mouth , " snarled a militiaman . Buses Almost Empty We moved around a corner into Leipzigerstrasse . We found no civilians but saw 15 tanks and 4 armored troop carriers . Wilhelmstrasse , where Hitler started and ended his war , was sealed off . A communist policeman refused to say wby and angrily waved us on . Near East tin railroad station , street cars and buses inched around almost empty . The streets were bare of humanity . Occasionally a person would dart out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rush into some building . " Where is everyone ? " my cabbie ' yelled . He did n't have to yell . I sat two feet from him . But I understood . You yell when you feel suddenly lonesome , like a small boy lost in a circus sideshow horror - house.
