THE MASK A Story by MIRA MICHAL I T WAS hot . When T asked the waiter for a siphon of soda water with my pressed lemon he brought it to the table and practically dropped it onto the marble top . I said something about ice in an uncertain voice , but he did n't even answer and looked over my head into the distance , squirted a little water into my glass without so much as moving his neck , and shuffled away in the unhurried , flat-footed way of French waiters , hugging the siphon to his breast . There I sat , limp and tired from the short jet Hight which had brought me to Paris from Manhattan some hours earlier . I had not yet telephoned any of my friends , and nobody knew I had arrived in town . I liked those hours of complete anonymity before the first telephone call which automatically would make me part of some sort of human activity . On my yearly trips to Europe for my New York dress shop I enjoyedthese brief periods between people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very short dural ion . As a matter of fact I was going to get up in half an hour to put a call through , and to make a dinner appointment for that very night , and I was now trying to put together enough energy to do it . The heat was unbearable , humid and oppressive , very much like New York in September . The fact that it was July and Paris only made it worse , because who would sit on an afternoon like that in New York on a tiny chair in the middle of Broadway and pretend to enjoy it ? On my way to the cafe I had bought a stack of current Paris magazines and newspapers , and I now started absent-mindedly looking through the pages of some talkative weekly . I skipped a number of long articles on the state of the world in general , and the state of France in particular , promising myself to read them on a cooler day , 61 and proceeded to look at the small items used by every newspaper in the world as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read : A spokesman of the Paris fur trade announces fur-lined fur coats for the winter . A few of those shown at the press fashion show last week included a beaver coat lined with white mink , and a threequarter-length broadtail coat lined with leopard skin . On page 12 , there was an item which ran : The elephant population of Central Africa is diminishing at the rate of 10 per cent per year . And on page 25 , I read : In Warsaw , Poland , a man named Jan Karossa has been wearing a rubber mask over his entire face for over fifteen years . M. Karossa held a press conference in his apartment , which he also uses as a chemical laboratory , last week . That was all . The editor must have cut the rest for the simple reason that he only needed a five-line filler . The waiter shuffled past my table and dropped a small piece of paper on it , which I recognized as my check . So Janek Karossa was alive , wearing his mask for good now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up my check , pushed it , with a note , under my glass , and left the cafe . I walked slowly and laboriously in the direction of my hotel . It was on the Seine embankment in an old and decrepit house , but its walls were lined with early Picassos , Juan Gris , and Matisses , and from its windows one could see the most beautiful man-made view in the world . My room was on the fifth and top floor , and it took me a long time to walk up the steep stairs . On each landing I stopped , panting , and stood for a good two minutes admiring the paintings . Once in my room I sat exhausted on the broad window sill and looked out . Beneath me , the stream of traffic made a steady and deafening noise which would have been bearable except for the hysterics of the motorcycles and Lambrettas . In my field of vision were Notre Dame , the tower of the Sainte Chapelle , the dark waIls of the Conciergerie , the river itself , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the em- Mira Michal is the pen name of a Polish newspaperwoman and novelist who lives in New York . Two of her humorous sketches about London diplomatic circles have appeared in this magazine : " The Almost Perfect Cook " and " Royal Ascot . " bankment somebody had written in enormous letters : " GIRAUDOUX AU POTEAU . " The inscription went on for half a city block . I hoped they meant some politician and not the writer , who was dead anyhow . But there was no immediate way of finding out . So Jan Karossa was wearing his mask , and the world 's press was now writing about him . It did n't seem possible . ... I met him first in the summer which preceded the end of the war . I had been sent by the boss to a pharmacy in a side street just off Main , to pick up some drugs . I was told to join the line in front of the prescription counter , wait until my turn , and then hand the attendant a blank piece of paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some pills , which I was to take back to the boss . I had a pretty good suspicion that it was to be some sort of poison meant for the more important people in the underground movement . They carried such pills on their persons to swallow in case of arrest . I was at that time an errand girl for one of the leaders , and his policy was to give me very accurate and simple orders and instructions , but never to say more than it was absolutely essential for me to know . I was given a very detailed description of the pharmacist . He was , I was told , tall , very blond , with brown eyes , aged about thirty , with a tendency to stoop and a habit of not looking at the person to whom he spoke . I got to the pharmacy on time , and joined a long line of tired and nervous people , all with prescriptions in their hands . Behind the counter a young girl worked swiftly . She would take the prescription from the client 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slip of pink paper , and disappear for a moment behind a partition of milky glass . The customer then stepped aside and sat down in a row of chairs along the wall . Every so often a man , my man obviously , emerged from behind the glass partition , approached the line of waiting people and handed each a small parcel in exchange for the pink slip . I stood for a long time in line , wondering how to accomplish my mission . Somebody had . muddled the instructions , that was obvious . I could n't possibly hand the girl an empty piece of paper . I tried to look at my man significantly each time he came out , but he never lifted his eyes for a minute . He fitted the description I had been given of him perfectly except for one detail : half his face was covered by a white surgical gauze mask . . . . 62 THE MASK I GOT up from the window sill . and went into the bathroom , where I let the cold water nil into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes on the red-covered triple bed . Right by it , on the wall , hung an archaic telephone , which tinkled occasionally like a weak canary . I would soak in the cold water for a little while , I de-cided , and call my friends afterwards . It was already five o'clock , but the heat was as bad as before . I slipped into the narrow , chipped , white-enameled tub with a sigh . The water was tepid but it felt good . Instantly the phone began to ring , producing an amazingly strong sound . I let it ring . It could only be the desk or a wrong number . It went on and on , interminably , but eventually and started whimpering I left the pharmacy , having accomplished nothing , and went to report to the boss . He sent me hack the next morning with instructions to give the slip of paper to the girl . This time everything went well , and I got my pills and returned to the boss . That afternoon , he and I sat at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tin foil , and put it into a match box full of matches . There were twenty-five boxes , and 1 knew that it meant twenty-five errands for me , twenty-five addresses to memorize and promptly forget . I remember that summer so well . It was lovely , with high blue skies and balmy winds and tiny white clouds sailing above the old trees of the city . I walked for hours from quarter to quarter , crisscrossing the town which I loved so much , and which soon was to go up in smoke , ringing doorbells , with my heart beating strongly and quickly , and delivered my deadly little parcels to unsuspecting wives , daughters , or housekeepers ... . T H E telephone started ringing again , and that was the end of my bath . Relaxing in a nib while the phone is ringing requires stronger nerves than mine . The bathroom held no bathrobe , only several small and rather shabby hand-towels . I draped myself in two of them and walked , dripping , to the bed . I was n't going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bed and stretched out on it . It sagged cozily in the middle as was to be expected , and in the middle of it I lay thinking that all these outsize Paris hotel beds were fit for only one person to sleep in , and that Janck Karossa was alive after all and p:obably still sleeping on that narrow cot of his . .. There is an old park in Warsaw , and along it runs one of the most beautiful streets in Europe . It has double rows of chestnut and linden trees on both sides , is straight and broad , and has on the park side a long row of comfortable benches . There during the balmy evenings of that summer the young walked hand in hand , the old sat and watched the young walk by , children played , and dogs were being exercised . It would have looked like an ordinary and rather uneventful summer , but for the fact that by eight o'clock in the evening all these pleasant and commonplace activities had to stop . Curfew rang at that hour . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mission , referred to by the boss and myself as " Operation Pills , " and was waiting for a new assignment . The boss had gone to Cracow for a few days , and had instructed me to do nothing , and to try and have a good and restful time . That particular evening 1 was on my way home from the house of a school friend with whom I was trying to pursue my interrupted law studies . I lived in a side street off the park , and 1 was in a great hurry because time was running out on me . Suddenly I saw a familiar figure ; it was my pharmacist . In spite of the warm weather he wore a hat pushed low on his forehead , the collar of his summer coat turned up as if he had a toothache . He was holding a small mongrel dog on a leash . The dog , fascinated by all the wonderful trees , was straining on the leash , and my friend was dragging him along forcibly , although the dog seemed strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very funny struggle , but there really was no time for games . It was five past eight , and the streets were heavily patrolled . When I reached my house 1 briefly turned around only to see my pharmacist dragging his dog into the house next to mine . We were obviously neighbors ... . I L A Y in the depression of my bed , and the towel beneath me was getting as hot as a compress . I was thirsty again and hotter than ever . 1 stretched out my hand to get hold of the phone . But it was naturally a good ten inches too far to be reached from the bed , so I gave up the idea of calling room service . . . . For two weeks I waited for the boss to return from Cracow . Every day I walked at a certain hour past a certain cafe , but he never showed up at the table just inside the window on the corner , and there was no other sign from him . I sat a lot in the park reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swimming in the Vistula , and in the afternoons sat around in cafes , worrying . By eight I had to rush home in order to avoid being caught outside by the curfew , and to ask my landlady for messages . There were none . Practically every night I now saw my pharmacist and his funny dog struggling along the street , but he never lifted his eyes from the pavement , never looked at me , never once . I wished I could tell him that by hiding his face like that he was making himself only more conspicuous , but I did n't dare . And then the day came when I finally admitted to myself that something must have gone wrong in Cracow , and that I should probably never see the boss again . That day I stayed in bed , telling my landlady that I was suffering from a very bad headache , and wanted to be left alone . I had to figure out a way of getting back into some sort of underground work again . I had no contacts , the boss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that what one did n't know had never hurt anybody yet , and now he was , of course , beyond realizing how wrong that is . I figured that I was probably safe from arrest already  --  enough time had passed since the boss 's planned return date . He had either managed to swallow his pill before they began to interrogate him or else had managed to keep his mouth shut . Otherwise they would have got hold of me days ago . Toward evening I got out of bed , went into a cafe , where I ordered coffee and poppy-seed cake , and on my way back home  --  there was the pharmacist again . I suddenly realized that here was my contact . I stopped in front of his house , and when he came I started making dog conversation . He lifted his eyes from the ground , and looked at me for the first time . Those clear brown eyes with the long feminine lashes recognized me beyond doubt . I smiled , and asked him what the dog 's name was ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house ; we heard military steps approaching and , without a word or hesitation , all three of us , dog first , stepped inside . He lived on the third and last floor in a small bachelor apartment , There was one large room , and a kitchen which he had turned into a laboratory . A narrow field-bed , covered with a striped hand-loomed blanket stood under the window . In the middle of the room stood a large table , covered with books and magazines , and one wall was lined from floor to ceiling with overflowing bookshelves . The pharmacist invited me to sit down , took the dog off the leash , and disappeared into the kitchen . He had asked no questions , and had not even told me that he had recognized me . He called out twice . Once to ask me if I wanted tea , which I accepted ; and again to say something about certain tests which he had to finish and which would take no more than ten minutes . Then there was silence . I sat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table on a small rug and already asleep . It was quiet and peaceful , the window must have been on an alley . No street noises penetrated the little apartment , but then there was the curfew , and the nights were very still indeed . I picked up a book , and began to read it , and after a while I was startled by light footsteps . The pharmacist had returned from the kitchen . He carried a tray with some glasses , a teakettle , and a sugar bowl ; he had changed into a white laboratory coat , and on his face was that gauze mask again . . T H E phone rang again , three times only , and stopped . I looked at it and thought that it was high time to get in touch with Jacques and Irene . They must have come home already , and they would be waiting for me to 64 THE MASK call as I had promised in my cable . They had probably arranged a party at home or would drive me into the cool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presents for them in my as yet unpacked bags . I should pull myself together , clear my throat and adjust myself to that first French sentence which would release a stream of quick , witty , and unaccustomed conversation . Pull out of my memory names  --  names of people , nlaces , of restaurants , theatres , authors , and streets . But I was n't ready to swim in French waters yet . Outside , the traffic noise was getting steadily worse . The sun was down , bateaux mooches were sailing down the river with music and a chatter of hundreds of voices . A maid tried my door with her passkey , but found it locked from the inside and gratefully gave up the idea of turning my bed down for the night and checking the towels in the bathroom . . I drank my tea slowly , noticing that it was good , real stuff ; the pharmacist sat opposite me by the table , mixing some white powder rhythmically in a small white mortar . I asked him whether he knew the boss , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that he did n't , that he only acted as a supplier of drugs and medica-lents , that he did this at the request of an old rhool friend , who , as a matter of fact , had van-/shed about two weeks ago . The only chance was to wait for the friend , who might turn up again , if he was not under arrest . I told him about the disappearance of the boss , and we sat there in his quiet room in silence , thinking our thoughts , I sipping my tea , he mixing his white powder , and suddenly it seemed to me that the city around us had receded like an outgoing tide , hat we were alone in the world , and for the first rime in years I felt secure and at peace and out of danger . My limbs became limp and heavy and relaxed , I dropped my hands into my lap and let my thoughts run loose . The dog sighed deeply and happily once in a while . I stayed with him that night and told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We lay on the narrow cot for the rest of the night , stretched out and rigid , with our bodies touching full length , feeling very long and slim like a marble couple on an Etruscan sarcophagus . We never once broke the silence of the room with our voices . When dawn came I turned my eyes toward him , and saw his profile clearly outlined against the background of the wall . It was a good profile with a strung chin and a shapely masculine nose and mouth . I scrutinized thelower part of his face , looking for a scar or some other disfigurement , but there was nothing , only the thin , handsome face of a very blond man , and I let the fingers of my right hand slide slowly and carefullyover it , and he turned to me full-face , smiled , and we were lovers . That summer I stayed most nights in his room . We spent many hours studying for our postwar examinations , I poring over law books , he over his chemistry and medicine . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a friend of my family , a well-known actress , who , in order to make a living during the Occupation , had turned her kitchen into a bakery and produced delicious pancakes which she sold at restaurants and cafes . It was a good business , and she needed somebody to mix the dough and then watch it while it rose in the warmth of the small and cozy kitchen . I liked the money she paid me , I liked her and the smell of yeast , vanilla , and powdered sugar which permeated the apartment . Each pancake had to be filled with jam before it was thrown into a pot of boiling fat , then fished out , rolled in confectioners ' sugar , and stacked on trays . The trays would be picked up late in the afternoon by two small boys and delivered to their destination . While we worked away in the kitchen the actress practiced lines from Shakespeare and Chekhov , from Shaw and Moliere , and in the evening I would take a few pancake rejects and return to Jan 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then sat around the table , studying , reading . Sometimes he had laboratory work to do and I helped him with the mixing and weighing . Sometimes we talked , but never very much or for very long . We told each other slowly the stories of our short and uneventful lives . After the first night he had stopped wearing his gauze mask , and I had no way of knowing if he still ran around the streets with his coat collar hiding his face , and his hat low over his forehead . 1 never dared to meet him outside . And then one night we were celebrating my nineteenth birthday . He had brought over from the pharmacy a small bottle of pure alcohol and mixed it with raspberry syrup , making a drink which was very popular all through the Occupation , and which for some reason was called " mama and papa . " We drank this strange concoction , and suddenly I asked him about the mask , and said how I had suspected him of hiding some hideous scars behind it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then got up and went into the kitchen , and my heart started beating madly , and I fully expected him to come out with the mask again . But after a while he reappeared and put out the tiling lights , thus making his face dissolve in the darkness , and started telling me about it ... . T WAS getting dark now but the heat re- mained , stationary , merciless and oppressive . I found it difficult to breathe while lying down , : ! nd got up and put on the light to look at my watch . It was nearing seven . I sat on the window sill and watched the Quai , the traffic beneath me , ihe opposite side of the river where some men were still sitting with their fishing rods . Two men presently noticed me , and started shouting something and waving , and when I realized that I was sitting there , with nothing on , with the lit room as my background , blood rushed to my cheeks ; I felt sick with embarrassment ; a wave of nausea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carelessly , pretending not to have noticed anything , and backed into the bathroom , where I let myself slide into the lukewarm water again . This is how the pharmacist , Jan Karossa , must have felt about the nakedness of his face . Why should people cover their bodies , he asked , and leave the most vulnerable , the most exposed part of it open for all eyes to feast on ? The only part which is capable of registering an expression , the most giveaway , the most indecent , the most crowded part . No wonder , he said , that the Gestapo was catching people left and right all over the country . Those idiots were walking around with their faces exposed , giving themselves away . They covered their arms carefully , he laughed ironically , their arms and their legs , and even their hands and fingernails were hidden behind gloves , while their faces , their mouths , their eyes and noses , their chins and foreheads , their ears and their hair , all that was left uncovered ! It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incomprehensible . At first 1 thought that it might have been the effect of the drink , the first I had ever seen him Lake . He talked on and on , trying desperately to make me see his point . He looked into my eyes to see whether there was in them a spark of recognition , and talked on . From the time he 6fi THE MASK was a young boy he could not face a mirror without shuddering . He had avoided looking into other people 's faces since he was twelve . He had kept it as a strict secret from everybody , including his parents and his best friend . He did not want to be known as different , and he managed to hide his feelings very well . Maybe he had to be reminded more often than other boys to keep his back straight and not to stoop so much . He kept his eyes mostly on the ground , and therefore was not good at games , and considered shy , but was rather well liked by everybody in his home town . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studied pharmacology , graduated , found a job , and went on studying medicine , when the war broke out and interrupted everything . At one point he shouted that the time would come when people would see his point and cover their faces as women did in Moslem countries , that special masks would be produced to clothe the human face , and he suddenly ran into the kitchen , and emerged with a piece of flesh-colored latex shaped like a full face-mask . He made me look at it closely . He hail sketched in with a pencil the outline of a pair of eyes , two holes for the nose , and another one for the mouth . This , he said excitedly , this was what he was working on in his spare time . An individual rubber mask for himself , a comfortable efficient mask that people could wear without any inconvenience , and that he certainly would wear when he had to go out ; a mask that would fit well , feel well , and that would let him keep his head high . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was over and the Occupation at an end he would be able to walk around town with a mask on his face without arousing the curiosity of the Gestapo . The next clay I asked my employer whether she could let me move in with her , claiming that the Germans were after mc . She said I could sleep on a folding bed in the kitchen , and that very afternoon I moved my small suitcase with all my belongings into my new quarters . I never saw Jan Karossa again . My search for a contact with the underground came to an abrupt end with the outbreak of the Warsaw uprising , which caught me in the street while I was on my way home with a large supply of sugar and yeast . I joined a hospital unit , was slightly wounded in the fifth week of the fighting , and when the end came I was sent with the remnants of the city 's population to the camp in Pruszkow , and later to a concentration camp in Germany . ... I YI N G there in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and started shivering . I jumped out , dried myself energetically with those damp hand towels , quickly unpacked a light-colored silk suit , some underwear , stockings , shoes , and gloves , making a mess of the room in the process . I plugged in my electric iron and pressed my suit . I then went to the bathroom , shut the door , and carefully started preparing myself to face the world . I put a tinted powder base on my cheeks , rouged them , powdered them , put mascara on my eyelashes , eye shadow on my lids , brushed my eyebrows with a tiny brush , with another one outlined my mouth , trying unsuccessfully as usual to make it look smaller , and smiled into the mirror as my face slowly disappeared under its mask . I was ready for Paris now . I put on my clothes , took out a little red address book , found the number , and lifted the receiver from the hook . It took a little while before the operator answered and another one before she got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the phone rang again , I was ready and full of expectancy . Irene 's excited voice carne over the phone . What had happened ? Was my plane delayed ? Was I all right ? I was , of course . Jacques would fetch me in a minute if I only told them where I was . I waited for a chance to answer , and as I was looking out the wide-open window , I saw that those men were still sitting there and waving at me again . I did n't care now . I waved back casually and laughed happily into the phone . The plans for the evening were all made , for the evening and for the next day , Irene went on and on . She had fixed me up to see all the collections ; the clothes were ghastly this year and terribly difficult to copy as well . We could eat at home , oh , nothing special , only a cold soup , Ian gousie , and some salad , as it was too hot to go out before midnight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sculptor , who had just begun to sell . I said that I would be over right away in a taxi which was waiting for mc , and began at last to tingle with excitement . Finally I managed to get off the phone , lifted the receiver right back again , and stood there stamping my feet and banging on the hook . The girl at the other end finally said " hello " in a rude voice , and I demanded a taxi , dug up my presents from the bottom of the two suitcases , and rushed down the crooked stairs .
