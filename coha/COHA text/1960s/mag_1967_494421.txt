DECEMBER 16 , 1967 challenge of the Draft Kennedy people in New Hamp ? shire and the District of Columbia , to name two areas . Suddenly , in Chicago , a much broader effort surfaced . The New York drive has been extended to upstate metropolitan areas , which were well represented , and college centers . Forces are gathering in convention states such as Colorado , Iowa , Michigan and Minne ? sota , to name a few . In state after state , , statewide meetings are being scheduled . Soon , the only part of the country left untouched will be the South , which had only a sprinkling of delegates at Chicago . This brings me to another of those inevitable " ifs " that kept surfacing in Chicago ? Senator McCarthy himself . Although he has been steadily escalating his campaign since the idea of actually running against President Johnson began to take root in his mind , a good many of his troops are , as I say , further down the road than he is . In fact , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech was flat ) that he is challenging President Johnson to a polite debate or , perhaps , a seminar instead of a no-holds-barred fight for the most powerful office in the world . Despite this , support escalates . The problem is , Senator McCarthy does n't seem quite prepared for it . His troops , already deeply com ? mitted , came to Chicago to get two things ? marching orders and an idea of the funding they will have to carry them out . A couple of delegations went home disappointed because neither were provided . As of this writing , Senator McCarthy still has n't selected a cam ? paign manager ( he 's looking over a list of top echelon men ) , a fund chairman or a press secretary . This , of course , can be remedied easily . However , there is a danger that the nationwide organization put together by Lowenstein and his aides will be allowed to dissi ? pate itself without proper leadership . This , considering the care with which it was assembled , would be un ? fortunate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one more thing . One issue ? Vietnam ? had brought most , if not all , of them to the Windy City . But other groups in the electorate are worried about other things ? fam ? ily farmers about the Administration 's handling of the farm program , minority groups about the need for a greater commitment in the ghettos and along the mi ? grant stream . These indigenous forces of radicalism must also be harnessed for the campaign . Wisconsin is a typical example . There , the McCarthy forces have real strength in three of io districts . Four more might be added overnight with the right appeal on the farm issue , thus giving McCarthy a real chance in the state . In many respects , the Chicago weekend offered a study of the strengths and weaknesses of the McCarthy movement punctuated by a series of " ifs . " " If " the mood of the electorate is really such that a major effort can be made to deny renomination to Pres ? ident Johnson , a good start has been made . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Massachusetts and , possibly , New Hamp ? shire ; by the farmers in Wisconsin and Nebraska ; by the Negroes in the ghettos of Milwaukee and Boston ; by the white-collar workers in the Boston suburbs . If the answer is " yes , the mood is there , " Senator McCarthy will assuredly return to Chicago next sum ? mer with a sizeable bloc of delegates inasmuch as the Democratic Party 's structure , outside Chicago and a few machine-oriented states in the Northeast , is , at best , a shell . It would n't resist a massive , well-funded effort riding the crest of a voter mood . Thanks , in part , to the way President Johnson has run , or failed to run , the Democratic National Committee . If that answer is " yes , " one can expect top officials in the party to come forth as the months roll by . Its long-range significance could be to recharge the batteries of a tired party structure and convert it in many areas into a vehicle responsive to the will of the electorate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have made a valuable contribution . Much now rests with him . Even if all the " ifs " turn out right , he must still throw himself into a hard-hitting , personalized cam ? paign that will arouse the interest of the voters if all this is to be translated into convention delegates . The beginnings ? but just beginnings ? were to be found in Chicago the first weekend in December . PAUL R. WIECK Puffing on a large cigar , George C. Wallace burst into the barber shop of the Sheraton-Palace Hotel . Two bodyguards rushed to cover the entrances . " The Gov ? governor " sat down in a marbled black and white swivel chair ; a nervous Italian began snipping tiny ends off Wallace 's black , greasy hair ; a Swedish manicurist manicured his stubby hands ; and an old Negro knelt before him to polish his shoes . Wallace talked : " All these hoi polloi people who sit in their ivory towers strokin ' their beards , what do they understand ? I 'll tell you these folks ? workin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's going on than any of these college professors . The barbers knew Castro before . They knew he was a corn munist . Like this man . Did n't you know ! " " Yes , sir . " " Before it was in the newspapers . " " Yes , sir . " That evening , the man who four years ago said he meant to " determine in the next election who shall sit in the White House of these United States , " met 1,300 people in San Francisco 's Veterans ' Auditorium . There was a church supper atmosphere . Folks were real friendly . Wallace arrived late , as is his custom . A huge Alabaman warmed up the audience ( " We come to you with the slogan ' Stand Up for AME-R-R-RICA ' " ) . Hand-lettered signs waved in the air : THROW THE RASCALS OUT . GOD BLESS AMERICA . GOD BLESS WALLACE . A preacher prayed " that we may hear and understand the great message we will hear tonight . " Fifteen Alabama Public Safety Department officers on state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and early November ? all of them large men with their walkie-talkies and pistols strapped on shoulders or hips . There were demonstrators out ? side the Veterans ' Auditorium , but two of the officers stood at the entrance screening arrivals . When the local police showed up , a sergeant ordered the Alabama guard to " let everybody in ? you 're in California , not Alabama . " ( Demonstrators do n't bother Wallace . Bill Jones , his campaign manager , has written that during the 1964 presidential primaries , " They pickets were encouraged every way we knew how , short of endors ? ing what they were doing . " Wallace needs them . ) " The Governor " opened up at about 20 minutes after eight . During the entire speech several bodyguards stood at far edges of the platform , their eyes running back and forth- across row upon row of friendly sup ? porters . Wallace , bent over the rostrum , a small pale man in a perfectly pressed suit , jabbed with his right hand as he addressed the crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the issue today in our coun ? try is that pseudo-intellectuals . . . do n't have any con ? fidence in the average man on the street . " Then , ' his tongue curling around each syllable " ? the taxicab driver , the textile worker , the barber , the beautician , the little businessman , the big businessman . " Pinpointed in a stream of light , Wallace could see only a vague field of upturned faces . There were few of his people ? few taxicab drivers , barbers , or beau ? ticians . Indeed , there were conservative church folk in solid-patterned suits and knee-hugging skirts ; old people frightened by an America that has grown away from them ( " I 've been 46 years building up my home and I sell to who I want " ) ; clean-cut kids ; business people ( " So many people are so wiped out after taxes " ) ; and a few workers ( " 3o years ago the commonman knew where he stood ; I do n't think he knows where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wallace speech is the " pseudo-intellectual . " " Now most of these people do n't even know what pseudo means , " comments a Wallace aide . " But they 'll get home , look it up in a dictionary , and re ? member . " A good Wallace performance ( his aides re ? fer to each speech as a " performance " ) carries the audience td within an inch of action . " If the politicians do n't watch out , " he said in San Francisco , " you 're gon na run over them . If they do n't give you a choice I 'm gon na come back to this fine state of California and we 're gon na stir up something together ! " Almost before the last ripple , of applause had died away , Wallace was in the back seat of a large sedan speeding for the airport . His car streaked onto the run ? way and stopped near the plane ? an old DC-6 ( rented in Texas ) , piloted by Wallace 's long-time personal pilot ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former stewardesses ( Texans ) . Silhouetted by auto headlights , Wallace walked up almost under the plane 's belly , shook hands with the ground crew . He was tired . At 48 , he seems worn . He is hard of hearing ? at press conferences , an aide usually stands behind him , repeating questions . As he entered the airplane an aide asked , " Governor , there 's a policeman who 'd like to come along for the ride . " " Why , sure , let him come along . " A dour-faced sheriff 's deputy found himself an un ? wanted seat over the wing and looked ahead a dozen seats to where Wallace sat . " The Governor " was one of his heroes . Wallace greeted him , then turned to me . " The little folks are sick of what 's going on . All this rioting . " . " Yes , I know , " the policeman interjected . " I 've got the hand to prove it , " he said thrusting his open hand up before Wallace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a festering cut , at the man 's face , finally at me . " I know what this man thinks . " He reflected for a moment , " Not his exact words but what he thinks . " Then he headed farther down the aisle , not giving the policeman a chance to tell how he had been cut by bottle-wielding Negroes after a high-school football game . In Sacramento , it was the same frenzied pace ? morning television taping , noon luncheon address , af ? ternoon TV program , an evening rally with an over ? flow audience . After the speech , the hotel switchboard was jammed as people called to ask how to switch registrations to Wallace 's American Independent Party . " The Governor " was elated the next morning ; a local television station had announced that 68 percent of those voting in a telephone public opinion poll fa ? vored him for President . But what would he do if elected ? " Why I would first DECEMBER 16 , 1967 stop foreign aid and I 'd have a talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to be the first line of defense , you 've got to be with us ' . " " We do n't think that freedom of speech gives one the right to advocate the victory of the Viet Cong , " he said . That 's the hypocrisy ! If these anarchists would spend time fightirt the Viet Cong instead of the police ! I 'm talking about Berkeley ? big talk about open hous ? ing and then vote it down . Folks in our state do n't un ? derstand a school system like Washington where there are n't any white people . " The conversation turned to demonstrations . What would he have done about the demonstrations at the Pentagon ? Wallace , angry , raised a fist : " I 'd take a billy club and I 'd drive it two inches into their skulls ! " It proved a good morning for the candidate . An interview went well . The interviewer had scarcely time to phrase his complicated questions before Wal ? lace was driving home his simple statements : " We have less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a Rotary Club luncheon fol ? lowed Sacramento . The Rotarians howled and ap ? plauded . When Wallace again appeared on television that afternoon , the commentator told him he was " do ? ing the right thing . " At the Bakersfield airport about 6o greeters were on hand . It was turning.out to be a real fine day for the Wallace crowd . Several aides commented on how friendly the town was . On reaching his hotel , Wallace hurried upstairs for the press conference . As he en ? tered the room , he appeared somewhat taken aback . The place had the look of a theatre one hour before a performance . Fewer than a dozen reporters sat at several long tables before the podium . In the rear , a few cameramen fiddled with their equipment . An aide asked if they wanted to move up front . They did n't . Finally , a reporter asked a question . Wallace 's an ? swer sounded as hollow as the question . Another re ? porter managed to phrase a question . Wallace replied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman re ? porter cried out : " What are the job opportunities for Negroes in Alabama ? " " Honey , you 'll have to come a little nearer so I can hear you , " said Wallace as he walked toward the girl . " What are the job opportunities for Negroes in Ala ? bama ? " It was the question he needed . Wallace pivoted on his heels and hurried back to the podium repeating out loud , " What are the job opportunities for Negroes ? " He was now the familiar , gutty , tenacious George C. Wallace , candidate for President , needing controversy as some men need liquor : Seventy-two Green Berets parachuted last week into Panama 's jungles . Their mission was to organize guer ? rilla forces for the deposed leader of Amanap , a myth ? ical Latin American country . Amanap 's pro-Western government was recently overturned by a military coup . When it turned out the coup leaders leaned toward Colonia , a nearby communist country , the old government took to the hills and called in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Savage Follies I , an elaborate insurgency exercise involving the 8th US Special Forces and Air Force 's 6o5th Air Com ? mando Squadron now going on in the steamy jungles of Panama . In the face of the real war , the Special Forces ' war games leaves one chillingly uncomfortable , especially the presumption that Green Berets would be called upon to organize guerrilla forces for a deposed Latin American government . In the past five years , nine duly elected civilian presidents have been deposed by military coups in Latin America . Unfortunately , Seabreeze ? Savage Follies I ? illus ? trates the presumption that has marked foreign policy since 1961 when emphasis was shifted in Latin America from hemisphere defense to internal security . In 1959 an assistant defense secretary assured a congressional committee that the biggest threat to South America was " Submarine action in the Caribbean Sea and along the coast of Latin America . " Under Kennedy , military aid and strategy abruptly shifted from the protection of coastlines to internal defense against Castro-type guerrilla warfare , and has been continued by President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress : " The primary objective in Latin America is to aid , where necessary , in the continued development of indigenous military and paramilitary forces capable of providing , in conjunction with police and other security forces , needed domestic security . " There are at present three major areas of US mili ? tary involvement in Latin America , outside the protec ? tion of the Panama Canal : ( 1 ) the US School of the Americas located in the Canal Zone , which turns out 1,400 Latin American military graduates yearly ; ( 2 ) 8th Special Forces Latin American operations ; ( 3 ) the
