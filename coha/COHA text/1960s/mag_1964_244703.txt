" It goes without saying that a lot can happen in the two months before the Republican Convention . " - TIME , May 8 <P> Covering Nelson Rockefeller from handshake to handshake in Oregon last week , Correspondent Nick Thimmesch realized that quite a lot was happening . Nick has been following Rockefeller ever since the New York Governor set out on the campaign for the 1964 Presidential nomination , and he knows how the candidate performs and what reaction follows. * And so , at midweek , he cast a sidewise glance at the polls that unanimously predicted a victory for Henry Cabot Lodge , and sent the editors in New York a wire : " There is a strong flow toward Battling Nelson . " <P> Soon after the Oregon result was clear , the editors decided to postpone the nonpolitical cover that was coming off the press and switch to Nelson Rockefeller . Working largely from the reporting of Thimmesch and San Francisco Correspondent Roger Stone , who covered the general side of the Oregon campaign , Writers David Lee and Ronald Kriss put together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the process , all of them found renewed confidence in an old principle : political polls may stir up a lot of publicity , but they are no substitute for knowing , thinking journalists . <P> Correspondent George de Carvalho is beginning to rank as an expert on exotic rivers . Five years ago , as our Rio de Janeiro bureau chief , he suggested and did the reporting for the color story on the Amazon ( Nov. 23 , 1959 ) . Not long after he became Beirut bureau chief in 1962 , he began to visualize color pages of the Nile . Last summer he sold his idea to the editors ; the results , thousands of miles , words and transparencies later , are the eight pages of color pictures and a timely story . <P> From the correspondent 's suggestion to the printed pages , the project came under the major care of two senior editors ( Henry Grunwald and Cranston Jones ) , two associate editors ( Peter Bird Martin and Charles P. Jackson ) , two contributing editors ( Robert Jones and Arnold Drapkin ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , one map maker ( Robert Chapin ) and one photographer-Laurence Lowry . While all those idea-and-word people had their moments , Photographer Lowry probably had the most excitement . <P> He found the Egyptians leary about letting him take aerial photographs of bridges , and the Russian technicians at the Aswan dam unwilling to speak to him . But he made his way through the Red tape , and won the cooperation of the Arabs . He took the opening picture in the color pages-a view of the Aswan cofferdam-with an F-8 Fairchild camera from a DC-3 owned by a United Arab Republic airline . With the door removed from the plane , Lowry stood in the open , a rope lashed around his waist and an chored to the tie-down rings . He took the picture on the last color page-a gold and green view of Giza-from a helicopter flown by a U.A.R. Air Force crew , firing away with his F-8 from a sitting position in the doorway with his feet on the landing gear . This was more or less routine for Lowry , an expert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " I think the workmen there are either very courageous or very fatalistic . " <P>
