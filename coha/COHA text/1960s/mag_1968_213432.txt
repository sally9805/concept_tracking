In treating certain types of cancer by radiation , doctors implant little gold " seeds " inside the growths . The seeds are actually hollow gold beads , each containing radon gas . After two or three weeks , the radon 's radioactivity is virtually gone . The harmless seeds are left in place , but a few of them may be sloughed off by the body . At Manhattan 's Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center , a nurse saved the seeds sloughed off by the tumor and had the salvaged gold made into a ring for her boy friend . He developed red patches on his finger . Memorial 's physicists found that the ring was radioactive and locked it up in a lead box where , 16 years later , it remains . <P> Other used seeds have been melted down and the salvaged gold has found its way into rings . In the Journal of the A.M.A. , two doctors in northern New York report cancer-type changes caused by a radioactive ring . When a man had a cameo ring remodeled in 1946 , the jeweler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten years , the man had so much discomfort on his left ring finger that he transferred the ring to his right hand . Eight years later , that finger also was irritated and inflamed , so he stopped wearing the ring . Too late . This year , the left ring finger had to be amputated for cancer . <P> Nuclear Alchemy . A New Jersey engineering professor and his wife , after similar experiences , have had damaged skin removed and replaced with grafts . How had the rings become contaminated ? Since radon has a half life of only 3.8 days ( meaning that it loses half its radioactivity in that interval ) , the seeds should soon have become harmless . Trouble is , the radon turns , by nuclear alchemy , into lead-210 , the radioactive isotope of that normally dull metal . The lead-210 adheres to the gold . Even so , the intact seeds are safe because the lead 's rays , unlike the radon 's , remain trapped inside . But in melting for salvage , the lead is released . It takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potential for damage . <P> The Atomic Energy Commission has no control over medical radium . The states license a dozen makers of radon seeds , and keep a watch on their waste disposal . But the AEC 's Dr. John Harley is concerned lest some contaminated gold may have found its way into dentures as well as jewelry .
