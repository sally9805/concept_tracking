The conclusion was just about what everybody had expected . " On the basis of prolonged study and evaluation , " the 150,000-word report declared , " the committee makes the following judgment : Cigarette smoking is a health hazard of sufficient importance in the U.S. to warrant appropriate remedial action . " More significant than the words was their source : it was the unanimous report of an impartial committee of top experts in several health fields , backed by the full authority of the U.S. Government . <P> The basic facts about the ill effects of smoking on health have been known for years . But the Government kept shying away from the problem . Not until 1962 did President Kennedy , under mounting pressure from medical groups , decide that the Government should make its own study . Surgeon General Luther L. Terry of the U.S. Public Health Service was charged with naming an expert committee to decide , simply , " Is smoking bad ? " <P> Switch in Mid-Study . For his committee , Dr. Terry chose ten men of unquestionable repute from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the controversy . Three , like Terry himself , smoked cigarettes : Minnesota 's Dr. Leonard M. Schuman , Harvard 's William G. Cochran and Dr. Louis F. Fieser . One smoked cigars : Michigan 's Dr. Maurice H. Seevers . One smoked a pipe : Texas ' Dr. Charles A. LeMaistre . Five were nonsmokers : the Army 's ( formerly Cornell 's ) Dr. Stanhope Bayne-Jones , Pittsburgh 's Dr. Emmanuel Farber , Utah 's Dr. Walter J. Burdette , Columbia 's Dr. Jacob Furth , Indiana 's Dr. lohn B. Hickam . ( Halfway through the study , Dr. Terry switched from cigarettes to a pipe . ) <P> The committee proved itself to be a deep-digging , shirt-sleeved group . Members worked like prairie dogs , most of the time five stories underground in the basement of the National Library of Medicine at Bethesda , Md . Their task was not to do original research , but to evaluate 8,000 studies , many mainly statistical , by other investigators from around the world . The job included a last-minute appraisal of the massive analysis presented by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A.M.A. in Portland , Ore . ( TIME , Dec. 13 ) . At the end of 14 months ' study , the committee found that : <P> &gt; Cigarette smoking " contributes substantially to mortality from certain specific diseases and to the overall death rate . " Its effects are in direct proportion to the number of cigarettes smoked and the number of years the habit persists . <P> &gt; The sharpest risk is lung cancer , from which cigarette smokers have a death rate almost eleven times as high as that for nonsmokers . Smokers ' death rates from other diseases are : bronchitis and emphysema , 6.1 times the rate for nonsmokers ; cancer of the larynx , 5.4 times as high ; ulcers of the stomach and duodenum , 2.8 ; cancer of the bladder , 1.9 ; coronary artery disease , 1.7 ; hypertensive heart disease , 1.5 . ( Heart and artery diseases combined cause many more premature deaths than does lung cancer. )
