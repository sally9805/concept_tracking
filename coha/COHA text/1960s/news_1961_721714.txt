txt Congress will make its ' firt review of the nation 's multibillion-dollar program of missile base construction . starting this week . The top-priority program , begun in 1957 , involves the construction of launching facilities for 450 Atlas , Titan and Minuteman intercontinental ballistic missiles . Delays ' of up to six months have occurred in the . Atlas program . Only nine Atlases  --  all at surface sites  --  are now in place . None is in protected underground silos . Whatever missile problem exists , according to Air Force spokesmen , now centers largely on the base-building program , rather than in the research or production of the missiles themselves . Investigations Scheduled With these factors in mind , three Congressional committees have either begun or scheduled investigations into the base program 's costs and delays . These inquiries involve the Air Force , the Army Corps of Engineers , missile and construction contractors and labor . Starting this week , the Senate Preparedness subcommittee will include the base program in a new study of the United States missile program . The announced intention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democrat of Mississippi , is to " find cult what we have now and are likely to have in the future . " After holding , closed hearings . last week , . a HouseApproPria , tion subcommittee released testimony today on Air **25;641;TOOLONG difficulties . Chairman Is Critical ' Despite some recent improvements , according to the panel 's chairman , Representative Harry R. Sheppard , Democrat of California , " this program has been marked by failure of top-level management to exercise proper control of a complex construction program . " This week , the subcommittee plans to recommend that one person be designated to oversee the base program in place of the present " coordination " between ' Air Force and Army Engineers . The Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations , headed by Senator John L. McClellan of Arkansas , has already begun an inquiry into labor-management problems at the missile sites , including the test center at Cape Canaveral , Fla . It is expected to hold public hearings late in March . The McClellan committee quirt ' was begun as leaders of the Building and Construction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Industrial Organizations issued a " no-strike " pledge on Feb. 15 . , C. J. Haggerty , head of the department , said he hoped the long-sought policy would eliminate 90 per cent of the wildcat work stoppages that have plagued the missile bases . Even as they welcomed the step , both Pentagon and Labor Department officials noted that enforcing the pledge at the local level would not be easy . A. nostrike pledge by all unions in World War II did not prevent major strikes , notably in coal in 1943 , these officials noted . However , with the Labor Department and the unions , the Pentagon is contemplating an indoctrination program designed to acquaint workers on the isolated missile sites with the urgency of , the " big picture . " Additional Army and Air Force labor relations officers have been assigned to the bases . 73,000 Man-Days Lost Some 73,000 man-days were lost on missile sites in the twelve months ended June 30 , 1960 , because of walkouts . According to Pentagon officials , this is less than 1 per cent of the total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moderate decline . McClellan committee aides contended , however , that the 1 per cent statement was some1what misleading  --  because it did ' not indicate how many base construction-days had been lost and ignored the ' added costs of making up for lost time . In the Sheppard subcommittee testimony released today , an attached Defense Department chart showed hat original Army Engineer estimates for Atlas and Titan base construction totalled $899,000,000 . This figure excluded the equally , costly Air Force - supervised follow - up " installation and checkout " of missile equipment . The Engineer estimates now stand at $992,000,000 ? an increase of almost $10,0,000,000 . And on the first five Atlas sites , the increase totalled almost a ' third . In Representative Sheppard's. view , " this all adds up ? to a sloppy Job , " and " is apparently destroying any realistic pricing in the coming Minuteman program . " The bane of the contractors is the Air Force policy of " concurrence " established to save time . This means the complex bases are being built while the missiles themselves are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sheppard panel , contractors complained of lack of central military direction and of red tape . Some said that the Air Force was holding up payments for xhanges approved by t he Engi ! leers . Some blamed delays in shipments of Government supplied gear . Others contended that , in general , the contractors were ordered to operate on a costly war-time basis under peace-time lump-sum contracts . Although Army Engineer spokesmen have stated that the first contracts might better have been handled on a " cost plus fixed fee " basis , this approach is frowned on as " profiteering " by many Congressmen . Pentagon officials who appeared before the subcommittee ) promised greater speed in handling contractor claims , and design changes . But they also charged that the contractors themselves on occasion put in unwarranted cost : claims , and over-extended themselves in bidding for missile projects . As important as the cost increases were the continued , " slippages ' ' in time , according to sources close to the Sheppard subcommittee . Almost all of the bases are reportedly three to six months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slippages " would be made up this year and the next as techniques improve and the " learning curve " rises .
