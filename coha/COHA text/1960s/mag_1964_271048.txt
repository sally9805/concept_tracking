In three conference rooms around Detroit , preparations are being made for a decisive confrontation . At the corporate headquarters of General Motors , Ford and Chrysler , janitors are washing blackboards , flicking pieces of lint from carpets and drapes , buffing and rebuffing elongated tables . Across these tables next week , scores of bargainers from the auto industry 's Big Three will square off against negotiators from the United Auto Workers in Round 1 of the 1964 labor negotiations . <P> At issue are the wages and working conditions not only of the automobile industry 's 565,000 blue-collar employees but of millions of other industrial workers , whose new contracts will be strongly influenced by Detroit 's pattern . Should the negotiators fail to close a deal by the deadline on Aug. 31-when the ' 65 models will be rolling out-a strike could brake the industry 's three-year boom and dent the whole economy . Noting that the auto companies are enjoying " fantastic " profits , the union figures this is a good year to step up to the higher-priced field itself . President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic moron could suggest that we are not entitled to greater equity . " <P> What Walter Wants . The Johnson Administration has asked labor leaders to limit their wage-and-benefit demands to 3.2% , but Reuther says he will fight for 4.9% or more because productivity is rising faster in autos than in some other industries . Detroit anticipates that Reuther will seek a wage raise on top of the annual boost of 2.5% or 6 an hour-whichever is higher-that the auto companies already award for higher productivity . A still more important issue will be his demand for earlier retirement and fatter pensions . The rank and file have been pressing their leaders for a plan to cut mandatory retirement age from 68 to 65 , to reduce the voluntary retirement age from 60 to something less and to raise pensions to a minimum of $400 a month , including social security benefits . <P> The most emotional issue involves not money but working conditions . Specifically , the unionists want more free time to escape from the noise , perhaps go to the toilet or relax over a cup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave the production line only for their 30-minute unpaid lunch break and two twelve-minute paid periods during the eight-hour shift . Now the union wants to shut down the assembly lines for at least 15 minutes during each shift-making a total of 39 minutes ' released time . Says U.A.W. Vice President Leonard Woodcock , who will conduct most of the negotiations with G.M. : " You have coffee breaks on assembly lines all over the world . Only the U.S. has no coffee breaks on the assembly line . "
