When the actors and the director were first announced for Everything in the Garden , I could n't believe my ears : Was Edward Albee concocting a formula Broadway hit ? Barbara Bel Geddes and Barry Nelson ? previously costarred , to quote from the program notes , " in two of the modern theatre 's most popular , long-running comedies : The Moon is Blue and Mary , Mary " ? were to be " reunited " in a play by the author of Tire Zoo Story and Who 's Afraid of Virginia Woolf . And Peter Glenville , who frequently wears the colors of David Merrick , had interrupted Alan Schneider 's long , unbroken Albee at the Crossroads collaboration with Albee to spread his directorial gloss over Everything in the Garden as he had previously over Tchin Tchin , Becket , and Take Me Along . These were suspicious enough signs . What made it even more possible that Albee was preparing to join the company of Jean Kerr and F. Hugh Herbert was the bizarre development of his recent career which found him first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , then , grinding out cocktail party chit-chat , in A Delicate Balance , with brandy being decanted over supernatural conversations in a House and Garden setting . It was soon to become apparent that , in Albee 's mind at least , all this was a planned strategy . " Let them think they 're seeing Mary , Mary , " he was reported to have told his cast during the first reading of the play . And , indeed , that is precisely what we do think during Albee 's opening scenes . The curtain rises on another of William Ritman 's Westchester settings ; Nelson and Bel Geddes , cast again as a cheerful suburban couple , start wisecracking about money , sex , and gardening tools ; and the audience , obviously relieved that it is being given one more inconsequential post-prandial entertainment , begins to respond with those flatulent barks that pass for laughter in our theatre . As the play proceeds , there are signs that Albee intends to jolt such expectations , but the audience keeps sniffing out the jokes , and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Melodrama follows comedy , looking false and misapplied . What was apparently intended as an indictment becomes just another pastime , and an increasingly unrewarding one . Albee has succeeded too well in his subterfuge ; the audience has taken the play away from him . It fails on the only level it can be adequately recognized ? as a bright Broadway hit . Actually , Everything in the Garden is an American adaptation of a London play by Giles Cooper which , if no great shakes itself , at least has a certain power without Albee 's commercial frosting . A black comedic attack on the values and prejudices of the mindless , country-club classes of England , the Cooper play concerns a middle-aged man and his wife , living above their means in a neighborhood where wealth dictates status . In order to increase their capacity for conspicuous consumption , the wife , Jenny , advertises for a job ; a brothel madam answers , anxious to add Jenny to her stable . Attracted by the possibility of some extra cash , Jenny soon begins turning tricks . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her husband ? after some initial indignation ? accepts the situation with equanimity . What is more , he soon learns , during a party , that all of his neighbors derive their wealth from the same polluted wifely sources . When a bachelor friend makes the same discovery , the friend is killed and buried in the garden . Thus , the Cooper play is a variation on the theme of the skeleton in the cupboard with Shaw-Ibsen overtones added an examination of the murder and greed that lies in the hearts of pillars of society . What Albee adds to this structure is a frothy atmosphere , an American idiom and environment ( the Cooper play was based on an actual story about some Long Island matrons ) , and a great deal of hamhanded pounding of messages . Where Cooper makes his points sotto voce , Albee yodels them in that tone of strident moral purity he usually employs when discussing his attitude towards South African apartheid and Pulitzer Prizes . " You 're all killers and whores , " shouts Al-bee 's heroine , after having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " germ gas " and that their publishing friends advertise bad books . ( This , I guess , is what is known as " universalizing " a theme ; like all the ideas in the play , it remains completely unexamined . ) Also underlined is the liberalism of the couple 's young son , who disapproves of anti-Semitism and racism ( a courageous line to take with the Broadway audience ) . And padded , if not added , is the character of Jack , the victim of the play , who is now a Lew Ayres type of philosophical drunk permitted direct address to the audience about his wealth , his passion for " Polish vod , " and his bequest of " three and a half mil " to the couple that helps to kill him . Albee 's play ends on a note of uplift : Jenny and her husband discover they still love each other , Jack tells us they will get their money in seven years " if they 're tough enough . " Albee 's version of Everything in the Garden , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concealing very well my reluctance to write about it . What continues to remain somewhat interesting , because unresolved , is the author 's ambiguous relationship to his audience . As I have had occasion to remark somewhat too often , Albee 's identity as a dramatist is highly uncertain . Lacking his own vision , he turns to adaptation ; lacking his own voice , he borrows the voice of others . What has remained constant through his every change of style ? through the progression of his influences from Genet to Strindberg to Pirandello to Williams to Ionesco to Eliot is his peculiar love-hatred for those who attend his plays . Albee 's desire to undermine the audience and be applauded for it is now leading him into the most extraordinary strategems and subterfuges , just as his desire to be simultaneously successful and significant has managed by now to freeze his artistic imagination . He has two choices , I think , if he is ever to create interesting work again : either to resolve this conflict , or to write about it . But both alternatives oblige @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great deal more daring , a great deal more open than he now chooses to be .
