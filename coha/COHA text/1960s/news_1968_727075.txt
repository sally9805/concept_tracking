txt Fundamental and deeply disturbing questions relating to the place of the veteran in American society have been raised in a report recently released by the U.S. Veterans Advisory Commission . Established in 1967 by the Administrator of Veterans Affairs at the request of the President , the commission was asked to study how tax dollars are being spent for the veteran and how Government responsibilities to the veteran are being met . The commission was drawn largely from state veterans ' offices and the larger and older national veterans ' groups . That it reflects the grasping philosophy of one of the most potent lobbies in the United States is not surprising . That its recommendations to the Government should be taken seriously is unthinkable . On the contrary , the report only illustrates the urgent need for an informed and responsible evaluation of veterans ' programs , for today veterans ' expenditures approach $7 billion , are the fifth largest item in the national budget , and veterans , with their families , dependents and widows , are approaching the time when they will approximate 50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Government to deal generously with every man who has suffered a disability in service and to equalize the opportunity for every veteran with the citizen who stayed at home , there is no question . There is great question , however , over the hundreds of millions of dollars in unjustified elements of the veterans ' programs and the added billions foreshadowed by the present recommendations . ? President Eisenhower in 1956 commissioned the famous Bradley report on veterans ' affairs , which , though much of it was not acted upon , was a model of enlightened thinking , fair to the veteran and fair to the nation . Animating that report was its conviction that military service in time of war and peace is an obligation of citizenship and should not be considered inherently a basis for future Government benefits . Retrograde in its philosophy , the present commission challenges this concept and would create a permanent privileged class of veterans , a postwar mercenary class uncongenial to the national heritage . While enlightened thinking on veterans ' affairs has called for the integration of veterans ' programs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as Medicare and Social Security , the recent Commission report opposes this position . The 1956 report also put a heavy emphasis on benefits for veterans with service-connected needs , but the present commission would extend benefits for nonservice-connected disabilities , despite the many Federally sponsored programs covering such needs . As a final effort to aggrandize and solidify the specialized status of the veteran and the concept of veteran versus citizen , the commission recommends that the Veterans Administration be given Cabinet status and that a Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs be created . Acceptance of these two recommendations would provide new pressure points for the politically powerful lobbies of the veterans ' groups and their emotion-laden , self-seeking campaigns . The nature of the report of the commission underlines the urgency of setting up a permanent Board of Review on Veterans Affairs , independent of the vested interests , to make a continuing and searching evaluation , a board responsible to the President alone and one composed of men whose first responsibility is to the broad public interest .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
