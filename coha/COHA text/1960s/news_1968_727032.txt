txt Year of the Political Chicken The New York Times ( by Carl Gosulh EXERTS PRESSURE : Governor Rockefeller threatened to veto the Legislature 's budget package last week and insisted the lawmakers enact at least some new tax increases . ALBANY  --  in Chinese tradition , this is the Year of the Monkey . In the New York State Legislature , it has become , as some describe lt , the year of the political chicken  --  meaning the lawmakers are more timid than usual because of the election this fall . Republicans and Democrats alike , almost catatonically fearful that voting for tax increases might cost them re-election in November , have performed a desperate charade these past few weeks in Albany , circling each other warily while hoping the blame for the taxes will fall on the other guy . As they jockeyed for the most favorable headlines , the legal deadline for passing a state budget  --  April 1 ? flew past . The self-conscious legislators , however , made it eminently clear that the citizenry had nothing to worry about . For the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun for the 21/2 weeks of their Easter-Passover vacation , which starts on April 11 , and , if past vacation lust is any guide , the public can be assured the budget will he enacted no later than April 10 . The Easter vacation is perhaps one of the few positive pressures on the 1968 Legislature . Without It , the budget shenanigans might have frittered on a few more weeks . Another pressure , at least in the budget situation , has been Governor Rockefeller , who until now had been rendered strangely impontent by the conservative jitters of this election-year Legislature . Just as the lawmakers were about to push through his $5.5-billion budget balanced primarily with " paper " fiscal gimmicks and , as some described it , " with mirrors , " he summoned the legislative leaders to his office and told them he would veto the gimmicks unless they added more hard cash  --  that , is taxes . So the leaders , somewhat chagrined , halted their budget package in mid-passage and started negotiating again to find the ingredients that would satisfy the ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have assured the leaders that it wo n't take much to satisfy him  --  he was not asking them to restore the $270-million state income tax increase he had proposed in his version of the budget , but perhaps just some of the little tax increases he had requested , such as those on gasoline and liquor . Together these two would raise only $36-million , a pittance in a $5.5-billion spending program , but the Governor was understood to feel that it was enough " to take the kiss of gimmickry off the budget package . " And also enough , others pointed out , to reassert the moral influence of the Governor over the Legislature in the public mind . To some political observers , this was a puristic move by Mr. Rockefeller aimed at producing a result more symbolic than substantive . And to these observers , there was also something of a peculiar similarity between the Governor 's behavior now arid Mayor Lindsay 's unyielding behavior  --  which enraged the Governor  --  during the New York City sanitation worker strike in January . In that dispute , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of moral principle  --  at Mr. Rockefeller 's suggestion that it was better to give the sanitation men what they wanted ? which was $25 more a year than Mr. Lindsay had offered  --  than to risk the health and other emergencies a continuation of the strike might create . The Mayor , a Republican rival of Mr. Rockefeller for national attention , argued that the $25 would constitute a surrender to an illegally striking union ; the Governor complained privately that he could not discern the high mordl principle in $250,000  --  the cost of the $25 to the city in the first year . There are some state legislators now who can not discern the high moral principle in $36-million in taxes . Nevertheless they will probably go along with the Governor , so long as it does not involve any increase in the income tax  --  which the lawmakers , and particularly the Republicans , feel could be politically suicidal . " These guys are hungry for anything but an income tax , " one Capitol official said the other day . " But the chickens will come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to raise the income tax . ' But most of them Ca n't think beyond this November . " - SYDNEY- H . SCHANBERG
