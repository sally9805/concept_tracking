txt " We had gone - " Unimaginable to bed in sum . Point of Time " ? mer and we at 2:43 A. M. awoke in autumn , for summer passes into autumn in some unimaginable point of time , like the turning of a leaf . " Henry Davin Thoreau thus recorded a change of seasons while he and his brother John were completing a leisurely boating excursion on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers in September , 1839 . They had gone to bed " on a sloping shelf in the bank ! ' lying in the grass upon their buffalo robes not far from where their boat was drawn up on the sand . During the night they were awakened " when the wind breathed harder than usual .. rustling the oaks and hazels ... like a wakeful and inconsiderate person up at midnight , moving about , putting things to rights , occasionally stirring up whole drawers full of leaves at a. ? puff . " If any New Yorker was awakened last night by the wind , or by an inconsiderate person , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of time " /when the summer of 1961 became the autumn of 1961 ; it happened just seventeen minutes before 3 A. M. , Eastern Daylight Time . Thoreau liked to New Carpet think that the wind and New was a part of the Draperies adjustment for a new season : " There seemed to be a great haste and preparation throughout Nature , as for a distinguished visitor ; all her aisles had to be swept in the night by a thousand handmaidens . . such a whispering bustle , as if ten thousand fairies made their fingers fly , silently sewing at the new - pet with which the earth was to be clothed , and the new drapery which was to adorn the trees . " Long before daybreak the two campers lay awake listening to the wind and the water and suspected " a freshness as of autumn in these sounds . " Early wakers on Manhattan Island have little choice of nature 's sounds to tell them anything so interesting ; the usual repertoire in the city is likely to be the chinking of milk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubbish ' barrels clamoring like demons on being forced to disgorge the refuse of a day that has passed . Everyone knows Winds and well enough in this an Evil part of the world Spirit mid-September is not only the time for a change of seasons ; it is also the season for hurricanes to whirl themselves into a frenzy over the Caribbean and take off on wild rampages headed toward the west and north . Some people have the fixed idea that hurricanes are due at this point because the equinox occurs ; they like to call anything in the weather line just now that amounts to more than a light shower " the equinoctial storm . " If it blows real hard and does any damage these observers have no hesitation in classifying the phenomenon as a hurricane . But the experts are more cautious and only use the term hurricane under certain specific conditions of wind , rain and lightning . The ancient Indian word " huracan , " or " hurrican , " from which we get our term via the Spanish , had a simple and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nature tioned before , in the dwellers in a city Original like New York have little opportunity to.read the subtler signs of nature 's continuing message . Whether they like to think of the equinox as a time of freshening up in nature , as did Thoreau , or as a period of frightening storms along the coastal waters , most of them will have to rely on translations of natural phenomena provided by weather reporters and based upon meteorological instrument readings . The satisfaction of reading what the clouds and the wind and the leaves have to tell us in their original idiom is one of the luxuries a metropolitan community can not easily provide . Local residents who Colorful have had the chance to Grand spend a few weeks of Finale summer on cool mountains , breezy beaches or placid lakes where the temperature varied only from moderate to cold , will miss this luxury more than others . No sensitive and observing human being can live close to nature even for a few days without marveling at all she has to communicate . Some understand her better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them and praise or condemn her for the wrong reason . But for everyone , today opens her grand finale of autumn colors.
