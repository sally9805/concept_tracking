Thursday , January 11 At the request of the United States Government , I attended a meeting in Washington and was told it had been determined " on the highest level " that it would he in the national interest to effect a Powers-for-Abel exchange . " If you are willing , " they said , " we would like you to undertake a mission to East Germany to negotiate the exchange .

It was on Department of Justice stationery and read : Dear Mr. Donovan : With respect to the recent conference with you regarding executive clemency for your client , this is to assure you that upon the fulfillment of circumstances as outlined the reason set forth in the letter to your client 's wife as to why executive clemency should not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

The meeting in East Berlin was set . Saturday , January 27 I took a cab to the Harvard Club to meet a Washington contact for my final briefing . I gave him my detailed itinerary for the trip , and he informed me when I could expect to receive official instructions in London . He told me that the East Germans were holding a young American Yale student from Michigan named Frederic L. Pryor for trial on espionage charges . Before the Berlin Wall was erected , Pryor had been doing research in East Berlin to complete his doctorate thesis on trade behind the Iron Curtain . He dug too deeply , obtained some material regarded as confidential , and now the East Germans planned a propaganda trial . The prosecutor had publicly announced that he would demand the death penalty for the young American . It was believed that the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion in favor of Pryor and thus compelling some form of recognition of the East German government by the U.S. Another young American student , Marvin Makinen from the University of Pennsylvania , had also been arrested for espionage , on the grounds that he had taken illegal photographs of military installations while touring Russia . He had been tried by a Soviet court , convicted , and sentenced to serve eight years ' imprisonment in Russia . I was told the East German lawyer Wolfgang Vogel now claimed to represent both the Abel and Pryor families . The other day he sent a message to the United States Mission in West Berlin that Mrs. Abel was confident that Pryor and Makinen would also be freed if the United States released Abel in exchange for Powers . However , our people regard Vogel as untrustworthy . The Government 's advice to me was that while I should try to release all three Americans , my basic mission would be to exchange Abel for Powers . Beyond that man-for-man trade , I should use my own discretion and " play it by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In response to inquiries , 1 was advised to take no recording device or weapon on any part of the journey . T uesday , January 30 I arrived in London early in the morning after a routine night from Idlewild by Pan American jet . I checked into Claridge 's hotel and shortly thereafter was visited by a young , very competent " Mr. White , " who alerted me to my departure for Berlin the following Friday . He told me that during the remainder of the journey I would be known as " Mr. Dennis , " for security reasons . Then he gave me some West German marks and I gave him a morning bracer of Claridge 's brandy . Friday , February 2 Before dawn Mr. White arrived and I checked out of Claridge 's . At Connaught Square we picked up a young lady representing British Security . When we arrived at the air base , Captain MacArthur of the U.S. Air Force introduced himself and we took off immediately . After refueling at Wiesbaden , we had sandwiches and coffee in the plane , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a two-hour flight along the narrow Corridor leading through East Germany to Berlin . We finally skidded into Tempelhof Airdrome , where our plane was met by an American named Bob , who had a small automobile parked nearby . By now it was snowing heavily . No one seemed to object as we quickly drove away . We drove in silence to a darkened private house in a residential section of West Berlin . We entered , lighted the living room , closed the blinds , took off our snow-covered clothes and for the first time faced each other in clear light . " Greetings , " Bob said . " I 'm sorry not to have talked much during our drive , but I thought that alter your flight from London you 'd like to settle down and relax before we had a chat . " He was tall , good-looking , around 40 , and had a quiet air of assurance . " You 'll live here alone .

We talked about everything except m ? mission . Later ? 1C drove o%er to the Berlin Hilton Hotel , cro Jed with commercial trwelers , and Bob shooed me its dimly lighted Golden Cit ? Bar . As %e drove home through the snow , he explained that after my trip to East Berlin the next day I should call him from the Hilton at an unlisted telephone number which I %%as to memorize . The number , he said , would be manned day and night for this sole purpose while 1 remained in Berlin . Saturday , February 3 I awoke literally stiff with cold . Outside there ? ? as sleet falling upon the snow , with that depressing gloom that can shroud Berlin in unpleasant weather . I soon found I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back : it felt like pleurisy . When Bob arrived we ascertained I had no temperature and he promised liniment . We drove through a snowstorm to the S-Bahn station in West Berlin , where I bought a round-trip ticket ( for good luck , I told Bobi . I climbed the stairs and boarded the first train . I recorded the details of the trip in my formal report to Washington written late that night .

He would drive me home , send the summary to the United States at once , and after dinner would bring a stenographer , to whom I dictated a detailed report . All the following " dailies " are excerpts from such reports . Other details have been taken directly from my diaries . ) At about 1115 hours I entered the S-Bahnhof at the Zoo station and took the train for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass by the first uniformed guard to have my passport inspected , but when I rounded a corner through a roped corridor I found approximately 100 people herded in lines and waiting for passport clearance . After 10 minutes only one or two persons had been processed for entry and the delay seemed to be deliberate . My passport and currency had yet to be inspected . Since it was almost 1130 hours , I left my place in the line and marched up to the nearest Vopo . Glowering , I loudly told him in German that I had an appointment at 1200 hours at the Soviet Embassy . He clicked his heels and promptly escorted me to the head of the line and I answered routine questions . Through the falling snow I at last made my way to Linter den Linden . I located the Soviet Embassy , but a receptionist , after checking , informed me in excellent English that 1 must proceed next door to the consulate , where my meeting would take place . I walked there , rang the bell and opened a formidable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a smilingyoung woman in the foyer . " I am the daughter of Rudolf Abel . This is my mother , Frau Abel , and her cousin Herr Dreeves. " shook hands with all three but said nothing . The " daughter " was around 35 years old , spoke English fluently and appeared to be very sharp . I took her to be Slavic . " Frau Abel " looked to be about 60 and a typical housewife . She reminded me of a German character actress . " Cousin Dreeves " never spoke , only grinned . He was a lean , hard-looking man about 55 : he kept closing and opening powerful hands , and I mentally classified him as an Otto the Strangler type . He probably was from the East German police . All were shabbily dressed . At exactly 1200 hours a door to the anteroom opened , and there entered a tall , well-proportioned , neatly dressed man with rimless glasses . He introduced himself to all , with a self-confident air , as Ivan Alexandrovich Schischkin , second secretary of the Soviet Embassy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me in English . " Very poorly , " I replied . " Good , " he said . " We both will do better in English . " He invited us into a private conference room , where he seated himself behind a desk and waved us to sit down . There were exactly enough chairs . From the time we entered the room until we left an hour later , no one of the so-called family spoke a word , except that the daughter said " Yes " when asked if the family could return the following Monday for a second meeting . Schischkin accepted them as a star of the stage might regard necessary props . I began by explaining to Schischkin that I was a lawyer in private practice , with many pressing matters , and that I had come at considerable sacrifice of personal time . I explained that I was required to earn a livelihood for my family and therefore could not stay in Berlin very long . I accordingly would require a prompt answer to my proposals . " Of course , " replied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was impeccable . " Secretary Schischkin , " I said , " 1 have come to Berlin for only one reason . An East German lawyer named Wolfgang Vogel sent me a message that Mrs. Abel believed that if I could arrange the release of her husband , this would free Powers ; the American student Pryor , held in East Germany ; and the American student Makinen , now in prison in Kiev . Upon this understanding I have obtained a pledge from my government that we will deliver Abel to any point you designate in Berlin , within 48 hours after an agreement is reached . " Schischkin drummed his fingers on the desk . I then passed him the letter from the pardon attorney in the Department of Justice . He read it carefully , placed it to one side and said , " Very vague . " I replied that any lack of detail in the letter was deliberate so as to avoid loose talk by stenographers which might result in a " news leak . " 1 then sat back in my chair . After a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them and said , " Over a year ago these Abel people came to my office in the consulate , because they are East Germans . I heard their story and told them I would intercede with the Soviet government , to see whether Powers might be exchanged for Abel . 1 later received a favorable reply from Moscow , because certain Fascist factions in the United States have sought to link this East German Abel with the Soviet Union . This falsehood has been a source of anti-Soviet propaganda in the United States . We would like to see this eliminated , in order to promote greater cooperation and understanding between our two countries . " However , as to these American students Pryor and Makinen , I have never even heard of their cases . You now have introduced a new matter , and I would be wholly unauthorized to discuss it with you at this time . " I expressed my amazement . The only reason for my trip to Berlin was the message from Vogel , supposedly quoting Mrs. Abel , I said . If Schischkin was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no instructions from my government and could only return home . " You would have no further instructions ? " asked Schischkin quizzically . " None , " I said . " On the other hand , %vould like to tell you of the preparations which have been made to deliver Abel here if Vogel 's promise is carried out . " I will communicate our agreement to Washington . Abel immediately will be sent here by military , aircraft , accompanied by the United States deputy director of prisons . He will be carrying a presidential commutation of sentence , already executed by President Kennedy but requiring countersignature by the deputy director . This will be done at the place of exchange  --  we sOggest the Glienecker Bridge  --  after I attest that we are receiving the right men . " A man to identify Powers is already in Berlin : the family of Pryor are here . as you may know ; and persons who know Makinen are readily available . All that is needed is your agreement and Abel will be released to you . " Schischkin listened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a document has already been signed by President Kennedy ? " " Definitely . " I displayed considerable annoyance that the matter was not being concluded then and there . " If Vogel misled me with lies , " I said , " I feel strongly he is a downright rascal who should be severely punished by the proper authorities . " " I understand your point of view , " Schischkin replied , but under all these circumstances it is impossible to discuss your proposals today . I shall have to communicate with my government . However , I will state that I believe you are properly annoyed . " I said that I could not remain long after Monday , reminding him that I required 48 hours to produce Abel . Meanwhile , if he should receive word from Moscow before fvlonday , he could communicate with me through a West Berlin telephone number . I wrote down Bob 's unlisted number on a card and passed it to him . Schischkin then said reflectively to me , " So it is three for one they want . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is always worth more than three mechanics . " With a smug look at my reference to Abel , he returned my smile . " 1 should like to express a personal opinion , " I said . " With the Abets now claiming East German citizenship , and Pryor being held by the East Germans , surely Pryor 's release should ease any difficulty in Soviet Russia 's explaining publicly what otherwise might seem to be undue concern for the East German citizen Abel . " We shook hands , and I left the office , with " the Abel family " trailing after me . They left at the next corner , the daughter explaining they were staying in an East Berlin hotel . The conference had lasted two hours . Monday , February 5 At 1700 hours ( live p.m . ) I returned to East Berlin and the Soviet Embassy , fortified by the strong liniment Bob had produced for my aching back . I entered the consulate shortly before the appointed time . In the anteroom were Miss Abel and Cousin Dreeves , who gave me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Abel spelled the cousin 's name , which was " brews " ( pronounced " Dreeves " in German ) . She informed me her mother had remained in their hotel room because she had been " very nervous " since our meeting Saturday . " Have you received any good news ? " she asked . I replied that this was a matter to be discussed only in the presence of Secretary Schischkin . Schischkin suddenly appeared . He bowed sillily to Miss Abel and Drews but cordially shook my hand . He then requested me to join him in a private conference in the inner office . He completely ignored my companions . He opened the conversation . " Did you report on our last meeting to your govern  --  ent ? What additional instructions have you received ? " " I reported at once , " I replied , " and my only instructions were to return today in accordance with your request and hear what further message , if any , you have received from your government . " Schischkin sat down at the desk and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he had received instructions from Moscow . In answer to my inquiry , he said there would be no objection to my recording the note verbatim . He then proceeded to read the following : I. The Soviet Government has humane feelings and in this spirit agrees to exchange Powers for Abel . 2 . This humane action on both sides and the elimination of a permanent source of anti-Soviet propaganda should contribute to better relations between our countries . 3 . If the American Government is interested in the freeing of Makinen , who is now in Kiev , the Soviet Government is ready to exchange Abel for Makinen , but a simultaneous exchange of both Powers and Makinen for Abel is impossible . It is up to the Americans to make their choice . If the matter is properly concluded , and better relations result , further developments could occur . 4 . As to the case of Pryor , this matter is out of the province of the Soviet authorities and must be accomplished through the East German Government . This can be done through Mrs. Abel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Donovan that their petition has received favorable consideration by the East German Government . Schischkin then stated that he had no further instructions . Mrs. Abel and I should proceed to devise a plan to effectuate the exchange , which the Soviet then would consider . Schischkin would say , however , as to the American suggestion of Glienicker Bridge ( which I had mentioned at the last meeting ) , " Not bad . " I told him that l was most interested in the reference to Marvin Makinen . Could I assume that in the event the other releases were carried out , and better international relations resulted , the U.S.S.R. would grant clemency to Makinen in the early future ' ? Schischkin said that he could not confirm my interpretation at the time but would make appropriate inquiry . I told Schischkin I would communicate this counterproposal to my government and hoped to return with a reply within 24 hours . Schischkin suggested that in view of my sore back ( which had been quite noticeable ) it would be unnecessary for me to return in person . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courier to the Soviet Embassy . Outside the embassy Miss Abel and Cousin Drews inquired as to what had transpired . 1 gave them a summary and Miss Abel said , " We must go immediately to see Herr Vogel , who has promised to remain in his office to see us . " When I asked her why Vogel could not have joined us at the embassy , she declared that he had so many clients he could not leave his office . We hailed a cab , and finally arrived at Vogel 's office . The entrance was poorly lighted I made out a Iligh I I 0 . Nt.tic , lead mg up a narrow hallw o ? , with absolutely bare walls 011 either side . It seemed like the approach to the ( Alice of zin ? tome ) that with Cousin I ' ) rews behind ?

At such moments one is comforted h ) the thought that there is no point in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place to run . At the head of the stairs , Miss Abel pressed : t buzzer and we were admitted to a small anteroom , w which led to an even smaller waiting room . Several people were sitting there when we entered , but rose quickly and left . In a few minutes Herr Vogel appeared and ushered us into his ow n small but well-furnished office . He was about 37 years old , dark-haired and good-looking with an ever-quick flashing smile . He wore a hand-tailored gray flannel suit , a w hite-on-w hire shirt , a figured silk tie w ith matching breast kerchief and elaborate cuff links . Vogel immediately inquired in German loAlicr I spoke that language well and I replied III " Very poorly . " ( In various ways during the day it was indicated the all believed I knew more conversational German than I would admit. ) o Illy surprise , Cousin Drews leered to act as interpreter and translated for Vogel my summary of the developments in Schischkin 's office . Vogel nodded and said he was pleased to present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the East German Republic . This was in German and read : It is hereby certified that the petition for release of your chant to American authorities can be granted if die conditions known to you are met by the Americans . Attorney General : Windliseh State Attorney . The message was obviously patterned after the letter from the United States pardon attorney which I had presented to Schischkin at our first meeting and w hich he had dismissed as " vague . " I wondered for a moment how State Attorney Wind lisch had seen the pardon attorney 's letter . After discussion of the letter I told Vogel that in order to make my own plans I wanted a simple answer to a simple question : II the tentative plan for the exchange were approved by all concerned , ( lid Vogel now guarantee that the East Germans would produce Pryor at the same time and place for the tripartite exchange ? " Definitely yes , " replied Vogel . Throughout the meeting I was reserved but friendly . Because of an indication in a message from Washington that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's conduct during the Schischkin meeting on Saturday , I made no reference now to Vogel 's broken promises . At the conclusion of the conference Vogel called us a taxi , and we all shook hands with him as we left . At the head of the stairs I politely beckoned to Cousin Drews to precede me . He did . Miss Abel and Drews accompanied me to the Friedrichstrasse station in the taxi . At . the station Miss Abel and Drews left . I went directly to the Hilton Hotel , arriving at about 7:10 When I called Bob , he said they had been very concerned over my late return . After dinner in a quiet cafe I returned home and prepared for bed . Suddenly Bob arrived . A message for me had been received on the unlisted Vest Berlin telephone number I had given only to Schischkin . It came from a West Berlin phone booth , with a man speaking in German : Unexpected difficulties have arisen . Must speak with you urgently in my office at I I A.M. tomorrow , 6 February @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the message . We both were suspicious . I felt strongly that if I returned to East Berlin the next day 1 should not visit Vogel but unexpectedly confront Schischkin with the message and demand an explanation . Bob agreed , so notified Washington and they approved the gambit late that night . Tuesday , February 6 At 1000 hours I rang the doorbell of the Soviet Consulate . A buzzer opened the door and I entered . About 15 minutes later Schischkin entered the room . He apologized for delaying me but expressed surprise at my " unexpected visit . " He invited me into the private office . l then informed him that after leaving his office yesterday , in accordance with his suggestion I had accompanied Miss Abel and her cousin to the law offices of Vogel . I described the visit , showed him the letter from the Attorney General of East Germany , and said that upon my return to West Berlin I had reported fully to Washington . I told him my report stated that although our government had been led to expect Powers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommend acceptance of the present offer of Powers and Pryor since I believed from the Moscow message given me by Schischkin that with the improvement of relations between the United States and the Soviet , clemency for Makinen could be expected in the near future . Schischkin nodded . I said that subse-quently my government had advised me of their willingness to accept the Soviet offer of Powers and Pryor for Abel , with my understanding that Makinen soon would be separately released . Finally I told Schischkin of the mysterious telephone message from Vogel late the night before and how , when reported to Washington , it had disrupted all plans . I handed Schischkin a copy of the m sage and he said , " How very strange a message ! What does it mean ? " I said that this was one of my objects in visiting Schischkin this morning , since the message had come via the telephone number which I had given only to him , at our first meeting last Saturday . " The Abel family were present when you gave it to me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number was written by me on a card which I passed directly to you , " I reminded him . " Some people have sharp eyes , " replied Schischkin . I said I trusted that the Soviet had no intention of withdrawing the position expressed the day before in the message from Moscow . Relying on this in good faith , I had completed arrangements with Vogel and Miss Abel , had recommended the plan to Washington , and they had approved it . I added that everything was now in readiness to transport Abel to Berlin for the exchange . Schischkin sat back in his chair and stated quite solemnly that the Soviet government was not in the habit of changing an expressed position . He now wished to reaffirm their willingness to trade Powers for Abel , but to reiterate that the matter of Pryor was beyond the authority of the Soviet government . " However , " he said , " 1 wish to make a few personal observations . You tell me now for the first time that you have arranged with the East German government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Before that , you agreed with my government to release Abel in exchange for Powers . It seems to me you are like a trader who is trying to sell the same merchandise to two different buyers and is asking both for payment . " " That 's ridiculous and you know it , " I said . " I have been accepting your stated position that any action by the East German government is wholly beyond your authority or control . East Germany is gran ting clen-tency to Pryor in recognition of two facts : that the Soviet is releasing Powers because of its ' humane feelings ' and the United States is responding by freeing Abel . In view olyour government 's stated position of the independence of East Germany , why is it any of your concern what the East Germans  --  or any other independent government  --  may decide to do in recognition of the commendable Soviet-U.S. accord ? II ' for ' humane feelings ' the East Germans de:ide to release Pryor or a herd of sheep , on the same bridge and at the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter which in any way concerns you or your government ? " Schischkin almost smiled , but he declined to give an answer . " Let me make one thing clear , " I continued . " If the deal we agreed on yesterday is now being repudiated , I will advise my government immediately . I ca n't state their position for them , but my personal recommendation will he that I return to New York and we abandon all negotiations on the matter . " Schischkin digested this for a moment and then said , " In my judgment , because of the message you have received from Vogel , you should go to his office at once . After you talk matters over with him , please feel free to return here later today if you wish . " I asked him if he could not telephone Vogel and have him come to the Soviet Embassy , to expedite matters . He was sorry , Schischkin replied , but while he occasionally saw the minister of justice of East Germany on official business , it would be highly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German lawyer . After a futile 15 minutes ' waiting for a taxi outside the embassy , I walked through snowdrifts to the Friedrichstrasse station and found a cab . We drove to Vogel 's office , the taxi driver silently accepting my illegal Vest German marks . At the office I found Drews alone with Vogel . He explained that Miss Abel would not attend . She was upset over the latest difficulties reported by Vogel and moreover was said to be " taking care of her mother . " Drews commenced to read a lengthy statement in English , which he said had been prepared by Miss Abel . I interrupted and suggested that I read and take the statement with me . Vogel objected and accordingly I said that 1 must copy the statement . The document , handwritten in English on cheap , lined paper read as follows : Last night after we had departed I was summoned by Mr. Vogel and he told me bad news . Mr. Vogel saw somebody from the office of th. , ktiorney General and when he mentioned about your words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an exchange of someone else , that official was greatly surprised . He stressed the point that originally they agreed to the exchange of Pryor for Abel , that is. one person for one person . Now itappears that the terms of the exchange seem to be different and this man foresaw certain complications . DDR ( the East German government agreed to exchange Pryor for Abel but nothing more . This agreement should be follo ? ? ed to the letter . II nut , DDR feels free to act as it deems necessary and can not give its consent to an ewhange of one person for two persons , one being from a different country . Mr. Vogel asked me to convey to you his concern for the matter , as he feels unable to postpone the trial of Pryor and in the Office of the Attorney General he was given to understand that in case of the American refusal to exchange Pryor for Abel they will start the trial and make a sensation out of it , as they ha% e enough evidence to convict Pryor ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S.A. and for the Pryor family in particular . When Drews finished reading , I became very angry and called the entire message " malicious nonsense . " I said that both East Germany and Vogel were obviously acting in bad faith and that neither my government nor I had time for idle games with such people . I wished to state that any idea of an exchange of Abel for Pryor alone was out of the question ; that unless East Germany adhered to the commitment officially made yesterday by the letter of the attorney general , I must break off all negotiations at once and recommend to my government that I should return to New York . I said I had the impression that Schischkin and Vogel together were trying to make a fool of me and that I would not stand for it . I got up and began to put on my overcoat . Vogel quickly pressed a buzzer on his desk . As though in a play , the door to his office opened and an assistant walked in . He stood stiffly before the desk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vogel had just received a telephone call from the attorney general of East Germany . The attorney general , said this latest addition to our cast of actors , wished Vogel to appear in his office at 1300 hours for a further discussion of " the Pryor flatter . " " This is good news , " exclaimed Vogel , rising and looking at his watch . " Please remain here in East Berlin until my appointment is concluded . I promise I shall try my best to have the attorney general change his mind . " I stated that since I had had an early breakfast I would like to he directed to a good hotel for lunch . After Vogel conferred with the attorney general , he could meet me there . Vogel agreed and gave me 50 East German marks ( I had explained that 1 had none ) and Drews then asked if he could join me for lunch . I said , " Of course . " On the way out of the office , Drews remained behind " to reserve a table in the restaurant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was probably telephoning Schischkin . Vogel , looking over his shoulder to see whether Drews could see him , made a thumbs-up gesture to me and said , " Niche zurockgehen no retreat . " He obviously was trying to carry water on both shoulders . Drews then came downstairs , and we all entered Vogel 's car , a surprisingly attractive new sports model . Since leaving Schischkin at the embassy , I had never referred to the fact that the Vogel telephone message delivered to me the night before had arrived via the unlisted number I had given only to Schischkin . Nevertheless , during lunch Drews volunteered that " after Vogel broke the had news to the Abels last night , Miss Abel was lucky enough to remember the telephone number which you gave Schischkin and which she had memorized . " He also volunteered that a business friend who was a foreigner happened to be in East Berlin at the time and , when he learned of their difficulties , agreed to take the message over to West Berlin to deliver it by telephone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . m . ) Drews excused himself " to go to the men 's room , " presumably to telephone . Shortly thereafter Vogel arrived . He announced that he had had a " terrific battle " with the al lorney general but had finally been " victorious . " He said ihat alldifficulties concerning the release of Pryor at the time of the Powers-Abel exchange had now been removed . The entire difficulty was because the attorney general fiercely resented the fact that the preceding Saturday . upon my visiting East Germany , I had called upon Schischkin in the Soviet Embassy instead of first visiting Vogel and the attorney general . I pointed out that my last cable from the United States to Mrs. Abel had clearly stated I would be pleased to meet either her or " her representative " at the Soviet Embassy and that if Vogel had wished he could have been there . I also said that this new position of the attorney general was strange in view of the official letter on his behalf , approving the release of Pryor , which had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Vogel replied that these matters were no longer significant ; the one important fact was that the attorney general now would consent to the release of Pryor . Vogel and I should proceed to the Soviet Embassy and , after a conference with Schischkin , Vogel would report to the attorney general that the deal had been approved by Soviet officials . He stated that he had already succeeded in securing an appointment for us with Schischkin at four P.M. I asked him whether this meant , without qualification , that all East German objections to the simultaneous exchange of Abel , Powers and Pryor had now been removed . Fle replied , " Yes . " We left the restaurant and proceeded at once to the Soviet Embassy , where we were received in the anteroom by Schischkin . He formally introduced himself to Vogel , as though to a complete stranger , and then inquired how . everything had been proceeding . Speaking in German , Vogel g- ... i  --  e him substantially the same report which he had given me at the luncheon table , stating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made no comment but then suddenly requested me to have a private fleeting with him in the inner office , escorting me in .

Schischkin stated that he had communicated these remarks to his government and that this afternoon ( Tuesday ) he had received a new message from Moscow . He opened a portfolio and pretended to read it . The message staled that from my remarks on Saturday , it would appear to Moscow that the American government regarded Makinen as more %aluable than Powers and that accordingly the offer of Powers for Abel should he withdrawn and that a firm offer of Makinen for Abel should be submitted . i e  --  ploded at this point and , rising , said that Schischkin had taken these few remarks out of context ; he knew full well that from the very outset the Powers-Abel eschange had been basic to the discussions and our obtaining of Powers was the sine qua non of any deal . I said that not only had Schischkin known this , and reaffirmed it to me that very morning ( Tuesday ) , but that the Moscow message which he had read me the day before had recognized my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ message from Moscow this afternoon has superseded all my other instructions . I now am unauthorized to discuss any matter except exchanging Abel for Makinen . " I said that after the message read to me the day before , and Schischkin 's oral confirmation of this commitment that morning , his latest announcement must mean that the Soviet was not seriously interested in obtaining the release of Abel . " You have been playing chess with me since last Saturday , " I said . " While I enjoy chess on occasion , I do n't now have time for a game . " " Me ? " replied Schischkin . " I play only volleyball . " I told Schischkin that whatever game he liked to play , 1 was interested at this time in only one question : Was yesterday 's deal of Abel for Powers and Pryor still firm ? If it was not , I would report this to my government and recommend that I immediately return home . Schischkin stated that this question was a new matter and that he must communicate with Moscow for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he should telephone them to me . I added that if I had not heard from him by tomorrow night , I would request permission to return home . Schischkin said , " Very well , " and told me I would receive a message tomorrow . I Icri In CansiderahNC heat and wllhottt shaking hands . Drews , who had waited m the anteroom , Joined me as I kit the CillhatitiN and Walkcd the entire distance to the at I riedrichstrasse  --  ith me . I told him that if the " Powers plus Pryor for Abel " deal should fail , and my government accepted my recommendation that I return home , I would feel obliged to report to Colonel Abel that his " family " apparently were abandoning him and perhaps he should reconsider his position of noncooperation with American intelligence . I added , with as significant a tone as I could , " I and confident he will accept my judgment . " Wednesday , February 7 I slept late and by noon there still was no word from Schischkin . My report on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and several reply messages had come . They carried two thoughts : ( 1 ) I had been playing my role so strongly that 1 was endangering Illy primary mission to swap Abel for Powers : ( 2 ) if I returned to East Berlin , it would be at my own risk . At 3 : I S P.M. this message was telephoned to the unlisted Vest Berlin number : Donovan : Unfortunately we got no reply , today . We hope to get it tomorrow . Will inform immediately . Schischkin . The game of chess was being played out , but it seemed to me that decisive action was necessary despite the caution urged by Washington . Unless a strong step now were taken by us , either the mission collapsed entirely or the Soviet would conclude that if they held out long enough , only Powers would have to he freed . I discussed the events of the past few days with Bob and he suggested that we consult not only Edwin Lightner , the State Department chief of mission in Berlin . but also Gen. Lucius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Berlin with rank of ambassador . Since we could not jeopardize my quarters , the meeting was arranged to he held in Bob 's . It was a depressing day , dark and tilled with sleet . The open fire in Bob 's living room felt good , especially on my back . General Clay listened patiently while I reviewed the advice from Washington and my own estimate of the situation . I felt strongly that if I could regain the negotiating offensive , Pryor would come out with Power 's . On the other hand , we all agreed with Washington that it ? vould be foolhardy for me to go through the Wall and pay another unexpected call upon Schischkin . We finally agreed upon a tactic which might carry the day . It was General Clay who wrote out the message which we dispatched to Schischkin : Received your telephone message and regret delay , as unfortunately the time which I can spend here is limited . As my back still bothers me , I would like to ask that you come 10 the residence of M @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6:00 P.M. tomorrow , Thursday , February 8 , 1962 . The address is 12 Vogelsong , Dahlem . Donovan . Bob left to dispatch this message by diplomatic courier . General Clay and I chatted about our last meeting , which had been up in Lake Placid . N.Y . We agreed that we now were in allot her world . Thursday , February 8 I was awakened at dawn by .1 courier from Bob . A message had just been received over the special West Berlin number . It read : Donovan : I got a favorable reply . Waiting to see you at my office at 4 o'clock today if your health allows you to comc here . Schischkin . Over breakfast , Bob and I considered the latest message . Should it be taken at face value ? Was it another skirmish by Schischkin in his obvious war of nerves ? Was it a trap set by Vogel or Drews , for whom the Soviet would disclaim all re-sponsibility ? believed I should take the gamble and go back , after sending confirmation to Schischkin . Bob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I arrived in East Berlin at 3:45 P.M. and took a taxi to the Soviet Embassy . A minute or two later Schischkin appeared and invited me into the private office . When I entered , a small table had been set up , on which were a bottle of Armenian brandy , German mineral water , cookies and a bowl of fine apples , with lovely crystal-ware and silver . Schischkin immediately poured the brandy ( which he described as " our best " and " very expensive " ) and suggested a toast of " good luck . " After clinking glasses , he stated that he had received a favorable reply from Moscow and that the entire deal had been approved . He explained this meant Powers would be exchanged for Abel and that simultaneously the East Germans would release Pryor . However , he stated , while the release of Pryor by the East Germans would be simultaneous with the Powers-Abel exchange , the two actions should not occur in the same place since East Germany is a separate government . 1 told him I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While I had no objection to such a procedure , I failed to see why it would not be more convenient to have all three men brought to the same spot . He said that lie believed he must insist upon this . I told Schischkin I would recommend to my government the acceptance of the foregoing . In so doing I wished to make clear my understanding that if relations between our two countries improved , an act of clemency for Makinen could be expected in the near future . Schischkin stated that he had communicated my " thoughts " on this to his government . which approved them in principle. * Schisch .. m said he was open to any prolosai on timing but that he thought the lollowing Saturday would be the best day . When asked about the hour he said , " The earlier the better . " I lirst suggested noon , but he said , " Why not earlier ? " When I suggested 0730 hours , he thought this would he excellent , since there should be few people moving about at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Powers-Abel exchange . I stated that I believed the official party should not consist of more than a half dozen . He indicated agreement . We had more brandy , cut up an apple , and at the conclusion of our visit he called an embassy car and chauffeur . Despite the cold and renewed sleet , he insisted upon escorting me out the door and across the sidewalk to the waiting car . I returned through the usual channels and arrived in West Berlin at 1810 hours . I gave a message for Washington to Bob at the Golden City Bar , saying that the deal was complete and " the package there " should be transported immediately . Friday , February 9 I met Schischkin at the embassy about 1200 hours ( noon ) and reported the general concurrence of the United States Government to accept Powers and Pryor for Abel , with the expectation of clemency for Nlakinen in the near future . Schischkin stated that a review of the traffic on Oberbaumbriicke this morning had led them to return to my original proposal of Glienicker Bridge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could not make the exchange before 0830 hours . As to Frederic Pryor , Schischkin argued at length that Pryor should be released to his family in Vogel 's " law office " in East Berlin . I natty refused to agree to Pryor 's release in any location in East Berlin . Schischkin finally agreed to his release at " Checkpoint Charlie , " the Friedrichstrassc border point , simultaneously with the Powers-Abel exchange . I told him Pryor would be met there by a car with a two-way radio , which would notify us at the bridge . He nodded . I urged Schischkin , in his sell-interest , to release Pryor today so as to keep the deals separate , but Schischkin replied that this would be contrary to his instructions . Saturday , February 10 I rose at 5:30 A.M. and wearily packed . It was my ninth day in Berlin and , if all went well , my last . After breakfast I went with Bob to the United States military compound . The small guardhouse , where Abel was held in a maximum-security cell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guarded . Inside I met the deputy director of prisons , who turned out to he Fred Wilkinson , the warden of Atlanta Penitentiary when I visited Abel there . He had recently been promoted . Over coffee we discussed final arrangements and then I asked permission to meet alone with Abel . Rudolf rose when I entered the underground cell . He smiled , held out his hand and said , to my surprise , " Hello , Jim . " He had always addressed me as " Mr. Donovan . " He seemed thin , worn and suddenly old . But he was gracious as ever and offered me an American cigarette , saying a bit wryly , " I shall miss these . " As the time neared for our departure , he took my hand and said with great sincerity , " I never can thank you enough for your hard work but , above all , for your integrity . Your hobby , I know , is collecting rare books . In my country such cultural treasures are the property of the state . But in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appropriate expression of my gratitude , within the next year . " I drove with Bob from the prison to our appointed rendezvous at Glienicker Bridge . When we arrived , it was clear but Strangers on a Bridge bitter cold . United States military police %vac in evidence everywhere at our end of the bridge . They had relieved the West German border guards , whom I discovered in the sentry box , sipping coffee and looking both puzzled and vaguely apprehensive . They obviously were uninformed of our mission . Abel arrived about 8 : I 5 in a car filled with guards . One of them , who later marched out on the bridge with Abel and Wilkinson , was one of the largest men I have ever seen . He must have been six feet , seven inches tall and weighed perhaps 300 pounds . I never did find out who he was , but presumably he came from the Federal Bureau of Prisons . At exactly 8:20 I walked to the center of the bridge , flanked by Alan Lightner of the State Department mission in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Powers during his U-2 Hying days . Schischkin meanwhile was walking toward us from the other side , accompanied by two civilians . He and I stepped out alone at the center of the bridge , formally shook hands and gave mutual assurances that all was ready in accordance with our agreement . I then introduced him to Alan Lightner and he introduced me to a " Mr. Pryzov " or some such name . We then beckoned toward our respective ends of the span and a trio walked forward from each side . Ours comprised Abel , Deputy Director Wilkinson and the " man mountain " guard . The Russian trio consisted of Powers , with a fur shako on his head , and two men who looked like retired wrestlers . Both Abel and Powers were carrying overstuffed bags . Schischkin announced to me rather precisely that since Pryor had been released by the East Germans at Friedrichstrasse , the exchange of Powers for Abel now could take place . I told him I must confirm this and called for confirmation from our end of the bridge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No word on Pryor yet . " Schischkin said my side was in error and that we must complete the exchange immediately before civilian traffic appeared at the bridge . I replied , " We wait right here until my people confirm that Pryor has been released . " I explained that we had told Pryor 's family the night before there might be a favorable development and early this morning several security officers had driven them to " Checkpoint Charlie " to identify and then welcome back their son . " My information , " said Schischkin , is that Vogel accompanied Pryor to the border crossing and the young man then was released . " " Perhaps Vogel is arguing with Pryor about his legal fees , " 1 suggested with a smile . This could take months . " Schischkin roared with laughter and said , " I yield to you as a lawyer . No doubt you 've had the same experience many times . " Suddenly we heard a cry from our end of the bridge : " Pryor 's been released . " It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ official-looking document and countersigned it . ( Identification of both prisoners had meanwhile been confirmed by friendly waves . ) At signs from Schischkin and me , Powers and Abel moved forward with their bags and crossed the center line . Neither looked at the other . Powers said , " Gce , I 'm glad to see you , " and grasped the hand of his former comrade . They walked together to our end of the bridge . Abel paused . He asked Wilkinson for his official pardon , saying , " I 'll keep this as sort of a diploma . " Then he put down the hag , extended his hand to me and said , " Good-bye , Jim . " 1 replied , " Good luck , Rudolf . " Schischkin stood aloof , then put out his hand and said to me , " How long will you and Powers remain in Berlin ? " I shrugged and , thinking of the Corridor journey ahead , replied , " I think we 're entitled to a few days ' rest here , do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Good-bye and good luck . " We parted . Tuesday , March 6 On this day the Central Intelligence Agency issued a report on Francis Gary Powers which stated , in substance , that he had reasonably performed his assigned U-2 mission to the best of his ability and had brought back information of value to the United States . On the same date Powers publicly testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee , which concurred in the conclusions of the CIA . Important to him , he was allowed to collect his back pay . Almost a month later Frederic Pryor arrived in my New York office , accompanied by his mother , father and brother . It was our first meeting . The family graciously presented me with a small crystal paperweight containing an actual piece of rubble from the Berlin Wall and an inscription , signed by the entire family , which reads : This is a piece of the Berlin Wall , from behind which you delivered Frederic on February 10 , 1962 . The gratitude of the Pryor family will last long after this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1962 , there was an incident at the Berlin Wall in which an escaping East German youth was shot by Vopos and left to die within full view of West Berlin spectators . At the height of this crisis a Soviet courier came to the border crossing at Friedrichstrasse and asked for an American mission officer . When the appropriate official was introduced , he gave him an envelope and package , addressed to me at my William Street address in New York . The enclosed letter read : Dear Jim , Although I am neither a collector of old books nor a lawyer , I believe that the two old books printed in the XVlth century and dealing with law that I was lucky enough to find are sufficiently rare to be a welcome addition to your collection . Please accept them as a mark of my gratitude for all that you have done for me . ... I trust that your health will not suffer from overwork . Sincerely yours , Rudolf .
