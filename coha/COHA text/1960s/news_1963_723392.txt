txt ALLIANCE DRAFTS WIDER LATIN ROLE IN CHANNELING AID New Board to Set Priorities for Development Projects and Enforce Reforms U. S. RETAINS FUND REIN But Washington Sees Need to Share Task as Program Enters Its Third Year By TAD SZULC Special to The New York Times WASHINGTON , Aug. 18 ? Latin America and the United States will make a major attempt this fall to streamline the leadership of the two-yearold Alliance for Progress . An executive committee will be set up largely on the pattern of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development , through which the United States has channeled postwar aid to Europe . The new group , known as the Inter-American Development Committee , is designed to turn the Alliance into a truly cooperative enterprise . The Alliance , its planners insist , must cease to appear merely as a new framework for a one-sided United States aid program . It must give Latin Americans direct responsibility in planning and executing policies , they assert . Group to Press Reforms The hope is that the committee , wielding considerable political power and acting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in pressing the Latin-American Governments into adopting reforms . Two years ago , under the Alliance charter , they pledged reforms and the United States pledged funds to root out the poverty through which communism might appeal to the Western Hemisphere . The new committee 's principal weapon is to be its power to recommend priorities in financing projects . A country that lags in reforms or fails to undertake serious economic planning may thus find itself deprived of funds . Until now , this power of decision has been in effect confined to the United States , largely because the Alliance has lacked an executive body . This has placed Washington in an uncomfortable position and exposed it to charges of seeking to run the Alliance . In the new plan , under discussion here and in the LatinAmerican capitals , the commit // tee would have a United States member to assure that United States interests are protected . While the committee can set up financing priorities , it can not commit the United States to underwriting any project . The United States has insisted on this assurance because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The finance ministers of the Alliance 's countries will meet in Sao Paulo , Brazil , in October to act on the new plan . At the same time , Latin Americans will move ahead with economic-integration plans in the emerging South American Common Market under the Latin-American Free Trade Association and in the relatively advanced Central American Common Market . Hemisphere trade is generally considered the main avenue to Latin-American prospierity . It develops new markets and increases production and incomes . The foreign ministers of the Free Trade Association  --  Argentina , Brazil , Chile , Colombia , Ecuador , Mexico , Paraguay , Peru and Uruguay  --  will meet in Montevideo , Uruguay , immediately after the Sao Paulo conference of the Alliance . They will try to make political decisions needed to eliminate persistent obstacles in the continental market . The Free Trade Area was established in 1960 . After two years of tariff concession , trade within the area rose by 31 per cent while the imports of Latin America as a whole dropped in 1962 by 1.3 per cent . Mexico Gains in Market Thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade within the area jumped 90 per cent  --  from $12 million in 1961 to $23 million in 1962 . Estimates made by the Chase Manhattan Bank in New York suggest that in 1963 Mexico 's exports to the Free Trade Area countries ? an example of what is possible under common-market procedures ? will reach $40 million . Actually , the elimination of all tariffs in the Free Trade Area is not planned until 1972 . The negotiations have been lagging the last year and the Montevideo conference is expected to revive their progress . In Central America , where the regional common market is to become complete by 1965 , the emphasis is on joint development rather than on national projects . The United States has no direct role in the Free Trade Area , which is purely a trading organization . But Washington is playing a major role in Central American economic integration . Since President Kennedy met last March with the region 's Presidents in San Jose , Costa Rica , loans and guaranties of $83 million for Central America have been approved by the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reconstruction and Development .
