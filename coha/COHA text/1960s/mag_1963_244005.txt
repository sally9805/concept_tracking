Apart from talking test ban , Moscow was talking movies . One Aleksei Ro manov , Russia 's commissar of the cutting room , announced last week that even though Federico Fellini 's 8 had won first prize at the Moscow Interna tional Film Festival , it was far too pessimistic to be shown to the Russian peo ple . The criticism was unfair . The Fellini picture is all about a befuddled movie director who wants to dramatize the nuclear destruction of mankind but in stead surrenders himself to just loving everybody . " Let us all join hands , " he cries as the whole cast dances a ring-around-the-rocket . " How simple life is . Let us live it together . " That is precisely the Kremlin line about the virtues of the test ban treaty and the joys of peaceful coexistence . Off the screen , however , life is not quite as simple as that . <P> Status Seekers . With Secretary of State Dean Rusk and British Foreign Secretary Lord Home in Moscow this week for the formal treaty signing , oth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign , too . Ironically , they are all non-nuclear powers , and except for a handful , they will never have a nucle ar capability . At week 's end the following had agreed to sign : Afghanistan , Australia , Brazil , Bulgaria , Canada , Denmark , East Germany , Ecuador , Ethiopia , Finland , India , Iran , Ireland , Israel , Italy , Jamaica , Japan , Laos , Li beria , Mexico , New Zealand , Norway , Poland , Saudi Arabia , Senegal , Soma lia , the U.A.R. and Uruguay . In addition , about 50 countries have shown an official " interest " in signing , and presumably will do so soon . <P> Most of the countries are merely using the test ban treaty for international politics . Examples : Israel , which is in fact working on an atomic bomb , is trying to show that it is just as peace-loving as Egypt 's Nasser , and East Germany is trying to assert its status as a sovereign nation , though unrecognized as such by the West . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is close to having its own nuclear force , flatly refused to take part in the new test ban togetherness . And Charles de Gaulle promised to make his position clear . <P> For two days at his country home in **25;792;TOOLONG , he studied questions submitted in advance of a scheduled press conference and memorized the answers . At 3 p.m. on the appointed day , as the raspberry-red draperies parted in the Elyse Palace 's gilt-encrusted Salle des Fetes , De Gaulle strode to the carpeted dais , and for the next 80 minutes delivered a virtual monologue to the assembled crowd of 900 correspondents , government officials and others .
