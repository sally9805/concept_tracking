The U.S. men 's curling championships have never before been held on the West Coast , and when they began last week the city of Seattle played up to the playdown  --  curler 's term for their finals  --  with sunny , springy days that brought residents out blinking like owls in the sudden brilliance . " A drought , " said one . " It has n't rained in four days . " They looked affectionately at the Cascades and the Olympics , their mountains which the mists disclose once or twice a year , and then the curlers among them turned their backs on these newly visible wonders to retire into the Granite Curling Club for a rigorous six days of competition to determine the ninth winner of the Marshall Field Cup and the rink ( the four-man curling team ) to represent the U.S. in the six-nation world championships next week in Scotland . // A Boeing engineer , Al Sundquist , calculated that the 48 men of the 12 assembled champion rinks each heaved about four and a half tons of granite down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each man was on the ice for at least six hours a day . Viewing the gentle sport of curling in this rather new light , it is no wonder that youth proved to tell . It is the Wisconsin rink , an infant team with an average age of 25 , that will leave for the Scotch Cup matches in Perth . // This may be a little damaging to the idea of the curler as a middle-aged storehouse of canny stratagems and mystic ability to read the ice , but as a member of the Granite Club says philosophically , " It 's like any other sport . Experience helps , but you ca n't beat the young ones . " Evidently not , if they are Skip ( team captain ) Bud Somerville , Bill Strum , Al Gagne and Thomas Wright , and if you are going to put your contenders through round-robin , rather than elimination , play with 11 other teams for six days . It is a process that separates the boys from the men . // The playdown began last Monday , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national anthem . " came the usual announcement and , " Oh Canada ? " the whispered question . Irreverent , possibly , but pertinent . An estimated 75% of the contending U.S. curlers were Canadian-born . Curling is Canada 's No. 1 sport . Contrary to popular belief , more boys curl there than play hockey , and there are about 500,000 Canadian curlers . In the U.S. only 20,000 people curl , but the number is increasing . // By Tuesday night in Seattle the rinks seemed to be sorting themselves out briskly . After 24 matches four rinks were undefeated , three were without a win and five had divided up the victories in a more equitable fashion . As expected , the eastern rinks were making a good-natured but not intimidating show of it , with Nebraska and , not expectedly Michigan , for company . Minnesota , Illinois , North Dakota and Wisconsin were undefeated . // Over the next few days the look of things became progressively less tidy , and it finally dawned upon careful followers that , except for Washington and Illinois on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against each other . They had been playing the weaker rinks , which accounted for a scoreboard full of unblemished , and wholly blemished , records . When the top teams did get down to business , they traded a few losses that did little to indicate where things were going . Illinois defeated Minnesota , Minnesota defeated Wisconsin and Wisconsin defeated Illinois . If not indicative of much , all of the matches were magnificent . // Minnesota and Illinois were the first of the four undefeated rinks to meet , and they were interestingly matched . Minnesota , despite the presence of a fairly stolid grownup in the person of 47-year-old Sibley ( Mike ) Stewart , is a jumpy rink , skipped by a 22-year-old whippet named Bruce Roberts . Young Roberts , of course , is new to skipping a team in national competition , and he did a cagey , unorthodox job of it . He has said that he lives and dies curling , and has proved one or the other by losing 40 pounds this season . This has left him a chain-smoking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble settling down . The difficulty does not extend to his curling , however , which is brilliant and steady under pressure ; if he were a bullfighter  --  and he curls with all the style and the passion of a bullfighter  --  Bruce Roberts would be shaping up as El N ? mero Uno . // The Illinois rink , on the other hand , skipped by Bob Warner , is not a nervous rink . It is steady , cheerful , solid and excellent , with all of its members decently on the far side of 30. // For those unfamiliar with the sport , curling is a combination of shuffleboard , lawn bowls , chess and pool , played on ice , which in the particular cumulative quality of its interest resembles baseball . It is a superficially simple game to describe . You have 138 feet of ice , with 12-foot , 8-foot , 4-foot and one-foot circles marked at each end , and toward these circles you propel heavy granite stones . The object is to have your stone , or stones , nearest the center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of each inning , logically enough called an end . Curling terminology is , on the whole , logical . The game is called curling because the stones curl , slowly and majestically , as they slide down the ice . An end is the end of both teams ' delivery of their eight stones apiece  --  16 stones to an end . There are 10 ends . Sweeping means sweeping . Bending refers to the arc of the path of the stone from delivery to destination ( and bend is surely as forthright a word for it as curve ) . // The placing of stones closest to a mark and knocking away your opponent 's stones are simple enough ideas . The stones themselves and ice as a playing surface give the game its particular physical quality , and the number of stones and the question of who has the advantage of the last one in an end make it strategically demanding . As in chess , there are certain usual opening moves , certain necessary responses and certain daring , unconventional moves which , by contrast with chess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have thought them up . // When you get the hang of curling , it is immensely exciting to see a final stone travel more than 100 feet , curve to a seemingly impossible degree and glide through a 14-inch opening between two enemy stones to change what could be a four-point score for one side to a one-point score for the other . Or to see one stone pick off another , and do it with the sound of a 12-inch granite cue ball hitting a 12-inch granite five ball . The pool analogy is just : a good curler can take out two stones 12 feet apart , playing off the corner of one to the other . // As to the sweeping that is done in front of the stone as it moves down the ice  --  yes , it does do something . No doubt the custom arose when the game was played outside and falling snow had to be swept from the path of the stone , but indoors on artificial ice sweeping has another demonstrable effect . The best curlers insist that real sweeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will travel , and a Canadian has wagered $100 , and won , that given three good sweepers he can keep any stone out of the house by sweeping it through or by not sweeping and letting it fall short . The reason usually given is that the friction of hard sweeping of the stone 's path melts a skin of ice and the stone thus glides on a wet surface . There are those who claim that it creates a vacuum , which sounds somewhat more mystical . // In any case , ludicrous as it may appear to see grown men flailing the ice fiercely with brooms , sweeping is difficult . It takes muscle  --  suppose your life depended on brushing up chewing gum stuck to a porous cement floor ?  --  and timing , and a very peculiar , unnatural manner of locomotion on a sheet of ice . With an awareness of this , the bull-throated roar of , " Sweep , you dogs , sweep ! " and the violent slap-slap of the brooms do not produce chuckles so much as visions of slaves in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Illinois met Minnesota . Illinois won the toss and blanked the first end ( no score in the equivalent of a first inning ) , and from then on the two teams inched point by point to an extra end  --  1-0 , 1-1 , 2-1 , 2-2 , on up to a 5-5 tie in the 10th . The score indicates an excruciating progression for curling , where 160 stones are played in a match and the scoring possibilities are numerous . To keep the score so low requires virtually errorless play by both sides , technically and tactically . It is nerve-racking , being flawless , which may account for a mishap at the end of the ninth . Illinois had Minnesota down 5-4 , and Illinois Skip Bob Warner delivered his last rock of the end , a rock that might well have decided the match . His second , Don Wilson , ran into it . The stone was fouled and removed from play , for probably the most painful single moment of the entire play-down . Wilson went off and appeared briefly to be trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned to the ice and the teams went into the 10th with Minnesota still down one . // At the end of the 10th , with a considerable buildup of stones in the scoring area , Minnesota 's Roberts tried with his next-to-last stone for an exceedingly difficult double , hefting his 42 pounds of granite in the highest backswing in American curling and delivering the heaviest rock of the competition  --  what the Scots used to designate " a thunderin ' cast . " It failed to remove both the opposing stones Roberts wanted , but it did blast out Illinois ' shot rock ( the stone nearest the center , which would count as a score ) and was a beautiful thing , though it failed of the particular miracle Roberts had in mind . Skip Warner drew his last stone in close to the center of the house , and Roberts had to play for the tie . He went for the shot rock , removed it and stayed , to tie the score 5-5. // Since his was the last point , in the extra end it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one end begins the next  --  and Minnesota began building up the house . By the last four rocks they had succeeded in putting and keeping three rocks in . With the 14th , Illinois ' next-to-last stone , Skip Warner hit two of Minnesota 's stones but knocked one of his own out of contention , leaving Minnesota lying one and two  --  two Minnesota stones in scoring position . Roberts put his last rock in front Of these , creating a seemingly impassible guard , and Warner threw the last stone of the match . It came down the ice at the dignified speed of a curling stone properly delivered ; it bent ; it moved between the Minnesota stones to come to rest , after 110 feet , an inch closer to the center than the Minnesota stone . The match had lasted three and a half hours and was decided by the last of 176 rocks and a margin of an inch . It was the best match of the championships . Minnesota felt terrible . // After the battle of the Titans , in a battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to defeat Michigan by a heartwarming ( to Nebraska ) score of 10-5 . " You ca n't lose ' em all , " observed Sid Osten later , vice-skip of the triumphant rink , fortunately out of earshot of New Jersey and Massachusetts , who had reason to disbelieve him . ( New Jersey finally did beat someone ; it turned out to be Nebraska . ) By Saturday afternoon it was clear that the last matches were not going to produce a winner . North Dakota , Illinois and Wisconsin were still tied up , the first two to play each other and Wisconsin to meet Washington . Washington , while not a negligible quantity , was still not the team to put your money on in a match with Wisconsin , which meant that Wisconsin would have to meet either North Dakota or Illinois in a playoff match . The winner was Illinois . North Dakota unexpectedly froze : if the Dakotans did not lose their touch , they lost full control of it , and Illinois ran up a score against them  --  9-3  --  by which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour 's rest it was time for Illinois and Wisconsin to find out who was the U.S. curling champion . Both teams , by this time , were tired and very tense , and they took to the ice with an air of considerable solemnity ; only Bob Ferris , the Illinois lead , seemed to be entirely himself during the first ends . So severe was the strain that neither rink undertook any very imaginative play . A rock would be placed by one team and the other would apply all of its efforts to removing it , and Wisconsin 's efforts proved superior . They won by 9 stones to 4. // It had begun to seem likely as early as the third end that Wisconsin was going to make it , and the real tension of the match centered rather on the question of whether Bud Somerville 's pants would . Somerville 's curling pants , his lucky pants , split up the front about halfway through the match . Bud turned his back and remedial efforts were made with tape and a large safety pin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we are fortunate that the U.S. is to be represented in Scotland by a skip with lots of it . // Bud Somerville is 28 , the oldest member of his rink . He is a commercial printer in Superior , Wis. and the brother-in-law of his vice-skip , Bill Strum . In July his second , Al Gagne , will become the brother-in-law of his lead , Tom Wright , when he marries Wright 's sister , Caren . This will make them the brothers-in-law four , or brithers-in-law a ' , as perhaps they will say in Scotland . // The Wisconsin rink is young , the curling is sound from lead to skip , and the boys must be among the strongest sweepers sweeping . ( Tom Wright , a large young man , has developed a style that looks like a mechanical toy gone mad . ) As skip , Somerville directs the sweeping of the others , and he is explicit about it , calling every stroke . Altogether , the Wisconsin rink will be the strongest team the country has ever sent to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottom in world play , but American curlers are expecting great things of their team next week . Their optimism may be justified . Somerville is having his lucky pants sewed up .
