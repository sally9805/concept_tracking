South Viet Nam 's constitutional assembly campaign was in full swing last week amid a blaze of huge red and yellow Vietnamese flags and a blare of sound trucks . Up and down the narrow nation , posters blossomed bearing the arcane symbols of the candidates ' slates : the Lamp , the Lotus Blossom , the Cock &; Hand , the Woman with a Basket . Declared banners and placards in Sai gon : TO VOTE IS TO BEGIN BUILDING DEMOCRACY . <P> To the enemy , it was an alarming thought . The Viet Cong has pledged " to smash the election farce of the U.S. aggressors and their henchmen in Saigon , " and ordered all the 541 candidates running for 108 places in the assembly-to be elected Sept. 1 1-to " withdraw their names immediately " on pain of death . So far the V.C. have talked tougher than they have acted : no candidates have yet been assassinated . But Communist cadres have been infiltrating hamlets and villages at night to conduct anti-election seminars , and have begun stealing identification cards and voter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reportedly planning to attack polling places on Election Day . The government will be waiting . All police leaves have been canceled , roving patrols and communication networks set up . In Saigon alone , some 13,000 policemen will blanket the city 's 559 polling places . <P> To ensure against any charges that the election is rigged , the military government of Premier Ky has laid down tough equal-time-and-money rules for all candidates-including the 55 military officers in the running . No candidate may spend more than 200,000 piasters during the official fortnight of campaigning , nor may he post more than 500 signs , distribute more than 120,000 handbills . Moreover , in each electoral district , all local candidates must campaign together , shaking hands and making speeches only as a group . The U.S. , too , is guarding against any appearance of unduly influencing the outcome : all U.S. personnel except combat troops in the field will be confined to quarters for 34 hours during the actual voting-and the combat troops must stay well clear of all polling areas .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
