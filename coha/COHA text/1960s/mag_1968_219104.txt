In Iowa City , Iowa , last week , a seven-man ecclesiastical court of clergy and laymen formally convicted Dr. Joseph E. Baker and his wife Matilda of disrupting the " peace and unity " of the First Presbyterian Church . The couple were indefinitely suspended from membership in the congregation , in a rare and unusual Presbyterian Church trial . <P> The unlikely cause of the proceeding was whether or not the First Presbyterian congregation should tear down its present church . Last winter , by a vote of 169-121 , the congregation accepted the recommendation of a building committee to demolish the First Presbyterian 's 112-year-old church and erect a much-needed larger one .

In a closing summation , he linked himself with Naboth of the Old Testament whose vineyard was stolen by King Ahab . <P> Unimpressed , the church court ruled that " the path of protest you have followed is not an appropriate testimonial to faith in Jesus Christ nor of love within the family of believers . " Under terms of suspension , the Bakers can still attend services at the church , but can not take Communion or vote at congregational meetings-and they can be excommunicated if they do not repent . Much to the embarrassment of Presbyterian officials , Baker has no intention of resting his case . Immediately following the verdict , he appealed to the Iowa Synod , and he plans , if necessary , to carry his case to the General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find myself involved in a significant struggle within the Presbyterian Church to preserve the right of free discussion .
