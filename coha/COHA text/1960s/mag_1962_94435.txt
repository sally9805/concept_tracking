The Irish have a love of the race and of horses that is more genuine than that of any other people in the world . Last week it seemed that nothing was being talked about in all of Ireland except the Irish Sweeps Derby , the richest race ever run in Europe . And on Saturday afternoon it seemed that everybody in Ireland was converging on the Curragh , the historic course where the race was run , some 30 miles from Dublin on the way to Cork . // In point of fact , 50,000 were there , many times more than had ever attended a race in Ireland before . They arrived on a mild , warm day under overcast skies , brave and thirsty racegoers with fat wallets and firm convictions , ready to pay tribute to the animal they love best . At the Curragh they found only one disappointment : an Irish horse was second , beaten by an American horse . // The winner by a head over Ireland 's Arctic Storm was Tambourine II , not only American-owned but American-bred . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winner , in fourth place , was the favorite , American-owned and Irish-bred Larkspur , winner of the Epsom Derby last month . And trailing a way over the rough turf were 20 other horses , the survivors of an original list of 627 nominees . // If the race seemed to constitute a major breakthrough for American owners , it completely failed to solve the perplexing question of which is the best 3-year-old in Europe this year . The four major tests  --  the French Derby , the Epsom Derby , the Grand Prix de Paris and now the Irish Derby  --  have produced four different winners , and in this the European season has developed an interesting parallel to our own . Sir Gaylord , Ridan , Decidedly , Greek Money and Jaipur have won our major stakes , and of this group only Ridan and Jaipur have shown any real consistency . Ridan , however , is currently preparing for some summer races in the Midwest against indifferent competition , while Jaipur has shown such an aversion to work that he has been sent back to George D. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Europeans , the Grand Prix winner , Armistice , is not highly rated ; many Continental experts consider the French filly La Sega , unbeaten in five races this year , best of all . // On Saturday , outside Dublin , there was only one best and that was Tambourine II . He is trained in France by Etienne Pollet , but is owned by Mrs. Howell Jackson of Middleburg , Va. , whose racing colors are the oldest on the American turf . In 1957 the Jacksons bought a mare . La Mirambule , who had been second in the Prix de l ' Arc de Triomphe in 1952 . The mare was brought home to Bull Hancock 's Claiborne Farm in Kentucky and bred to Princequillo . The result was Tambourine II . He did not race at 2 , but he won his first two starts before finishing fourth to Val de Loir in the French Derby . The Jacksons have been racing abroad for only four years , and Tambourine II is their second big success . They had previously bought a mare in foal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Mrs. Jackson named Never Too Late . In 1960 the filly won two of England 's major races , the One Thousand Guineas and the Oaks . // The Curragh is a typical rolling European turf course . On the route laid out for the Derby , the horses , running clockwise , reach a sudden right turn after a short run . For five furlongs the course is straight , climbing toward the end ; then it veers right around another bumpy turn and goes downhill for a quarter of a mile over very rough ground . At the three-eighths pole the course curves sharply into the stretch , and in the last furlong the turf rises right up to the wire . This route was a modification of the traditional Curragh mile and a half , which normally takes the horses out of sight of the fans . One disgruntled trainer referred to the Derby route as a circus course , and many horsemen , after walking over the severely tightened layout with their jockeys before the race , felt that the Irish Derby could be won this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stamina for a mile and a half . It is doubtful , however , that after watching the race anyone can accuse Tambourine II of not being able to go the classic distance . This bay colt has the look  --  and the breeding  --  of a runner , and on Saturday he was one . // Breaking from the center of the pack , Tambourine II was always well placed by his jockey , France 's Roger Poincelet . He won the race by making up ground the hard way on the outside going up the first hill . He took the lead at the start of the straight . Poincelet said he felt Tambourine II hesitate for a stride or two when the colt came to the head of the stretch and saw half a hundred thousand frenzied Irishmen before him . It could have been only for an instant , however , because Tambourine II held the lead for the last three-eighths of a mile , with Arctic Storm coming at him with a rush in the last furlong . Poincelet , nine times France 's riding champion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was his first ride in the Irish Derby . Five lengths back was Sebring , owned by Townsend Martin , who also owns Sunrise County . Three lengths behind Sebring was Larkspur , the smallish chestnut colt trained by that incomparable Irishman , Vincent O'Brien , for Virginia Sportsman Raymond Guest . If those 50,000 Irishmen at the Curragh could not see an Irish horse win , they would have been happy if Larkspur did . He is Irish-bred and , after his Epsom Downs victory , was commonly accepted as the best 3-year-old in Europe . // Dismaying as the American performance was to this nation of horse lovers , this Derby nevertheless looked like the healthy start of a new era in Irish racing . The gross purse was $190,400 , with $140,075 to the winner  --  making it the richest race in the world for 3-year-olds . Last year the gross purse was only $22,000 , large enough for Ireland perhaps , but not enough to attract the owners of the best racehorses in other countries . This year the firm headed by 74-year-old Joseph McGrath , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That probably accounted for the presence of Larkspur , Tambourine II and others . The benevolence of the firm is explained by the prosperity of the Sweepstakes . The Sweeps are traditional in Ireland and , although selling the tickets is illegal in most other countries , they are always available at ? 1 , or $2.80 , largely because of the matchless organization of cagey Joe McGrath , who thought up the whole idea back in 1930. // This year 5,630,304 people around the world managed to find ways to buy Sweepstakes tickets and shelled out ? 1 each , the money rolling in before the Irish Derby to an enormous office in Dublin ( as it does also on sweepstakes for the Grand National and the Cambridgeshire ) . There a staff of 2,500 , employed by McGrath 's firm , Hospitals ' Trust , Ltd. , processed each ticket and took care of the distribution of prize money . They doled out $8,880,200 to 7,928 winners  --  a ticket on Tambourine II winning $140,000 , one on Arctic Storm 556,000 and one on Sebring $28,000 . Another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tickets . That still left $2,911,546 to be turned over to some 400 Irish hospitals . // Joe McGrath and his firm do not run the Sweepstakes just for the sheer joy of doing good . " We get a fee , of course , " says Paddy McGrath , Joe 's 35-year-old son . It is n't too bad a fee , either , being 2 ? % of the total , or about $335,000 in the case of the Irish Derby . The McGraths are n't ashamed of accepting this kind of pin money but , Paddy points out , " This is hardly our only source of income . We run 11 other businesses besides the Sweeps . They include a bottle works , a steel works and two carpet factories , not to mention our racing and breeding industry . I guess it 's between us and the Aga Khan as to which is the biggest racing operation in Europe . " // Purses draw horses // If Hospitals ' Trust , Ltd. continues to add substantial sums to the purse , future Irish Derbies will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of good horses , whether they come from the Irish tracks at Phoenix Park and Limerick Junction or from Newmarket , Hollywood Park , Keene-land or Saratoga , are always going to seek the richest prize money available . The victory of Tambourine II was the first Irish Derby win for Trainer Pollet , who seldom sends out a runner  --  in France or elsewhere  --  unless he thinks he has an exceptionally good chance to win . // International racing up to now has been pretty much of a one-way deal . Horses from abroad have come to the U.S. each year for the Laurel International , but this is surely not enough . Nor does it help much that nearly 100 Americans now buy yearlings in Europe and keep them there to race . We must send our best there . A French racing official in Paris said that because Laurel is an invitational race , with traveling expenses paid by the track , American owners think of international racing only in terms of invitations . When told that the purse of the International had been increased to $125,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sixth-and seventh-place finishers , the Frenchman laughed and said , " Is there nothing for finishing last ? " Americans , he said , do n't seem to realize that there are plenty of rich races in Europe , " but they have nomination fees and closing dates just like most of your races . Americans should come and race abroad without being led by the hand . "
