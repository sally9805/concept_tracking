txt Illinois national guardsmen will be fully armed if they are sent into a riot , Brig . Gen. Richard T. Dunn , Illinois guard commander , said yesterday . Dunn made the remark after a report in Washington that most guardsmen entering riot areas will be armed only with Brig . Gen. Richard Dunn bayonets , their rifles either empty or containing blank ammunition . The report said the riot instructions were given in an official lesson plan being used by guard commanders across the nation . May Need Force " If civil disturbances are so serious as to require commitment of the Illinois national guard , it is obvious that restoration of law and order may require the application of a high degree of force , " Dunn said . " In other words , Illinois national guardsmen will not go onto the street without weapons and ammunition . Blank ammunition will not be used . They must be prepared . " Dunn said that guard commanders must- keep in mind that inadequate force may result in increased violence . He said the force to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to the use of chemical agents , to fire by selected marksmen , and to full unit fire power . Must Exerise Judgment " The guiding principle for the employment of force is to use only the force which is necessary to restore law and order , " he said . " The commander must exercise his considered judgment to determine the degree of force to be employed . " The riot instructions given in the report were aimed at reducing the number of personal judgments that guardsmen will have to make in riot areas  --  judgments that could result in the killing of bystanders or too severe preventive measures . The Michigan guard was accused of misusing weapons during riots in Detroit last summer . Officers want to reduce the chances of that happening again , should troops be mobilized for riot duty . The Illinois guard , however , is held by the Pentagon as an example of an efficient organization , well trained for commitment to riots , guard officials said .
