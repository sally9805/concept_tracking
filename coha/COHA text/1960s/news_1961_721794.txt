" But some people want to play a record every ten minutes . " You have been very patient and have said , ' Let them be heard , ' but the rest of us do n't necessarily want to hear them . I 've heard it said people like to hear their heads roar . It 's the big stuff we want to hear , not this chicken stuff . "
