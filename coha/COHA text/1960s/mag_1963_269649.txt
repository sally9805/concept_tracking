Copper Calhoon , that beautiful but bitchy businesswoman , barked at her secretary : " Take a letter to-ah-what 's his name in the Defense Department . " Then she began dictating : " The manner in which you are running your office is a combination of Alice in Wonderland and the sort of strategy which resulted in Custer 's last stand . " <P> In putting such words into Copper 's mouth , Cartoonist Milton Caniff insists that he has nothing against Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara ; he is merely trying to keep his Steve Canyon comic strip topical . Well , that he is . For the chorus of criticism against McNamara is one of the liveliest conversational topics in Washington nowadays . <P> Most of McNamara 's critics acknowledge that he is tremendously able , that he has taken charge at the Pentagon as no civilian has done before him . But they insist that he lacks " heart , " has lowered service morale by his treatment of military leaders , relies too heavily on the advice of his civilian " whiz kid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most outspoken critics : &gt; Hanson W. Baldwin , veteran military affairs analyst of the New York Times , lit into McNamara last March in a Saturday Evening Post article under the bitter title : " The McNamara Monarchy . " Wrote Baldwin : " The ' unification ' of the armed services sponsored by McNamara poses some subtle and insidious dangers-creeping dangers . . . that could present , in their ultimate form , almost as great a threat to a secure and free nation as an attempted military coup . " In a column distributed to newspapers last month and then ordered killed by the Times News Service before publication , Baldwin said : " Weariness , mistrust , recrimination and mutual suspicion , particularly between many of the top civilian and military officials , prevail " in the Pentagon . Uniformed personnel feel , he said , that " top civilians in the Pentagon show too little warmth or sense of leadership , of loyalty down to their subordinates , or of the importance of the human being to the military services in the nuclear age . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D. White , now a Newsweek military columnist and occasional contributor to other publications , recently wrote : " I am profoundly apprehensive of the pipe-smoking , tree-full-of-owls type of so-called professional ' defense intellectuals ' who have been brought into this nation 's capital . I do n't believe a lot of these often overconfident , sometimes arrogant , young professors , mathematicians and other theorists have sufficient worldliness or motivation to stand up to the kind of enemy we face . " <P> &gt; Author and Syndicated Columnist S.L.A. Marshall , a retired Army brigadier general , wrote : " McNamara has lost the confidence of the armed services , the majority of the officer corps in the active forces , the majority of retired people and the majority of senior officers in the civilian components . " Furthermore , contends Marshall , " there is intense dissatisfaction " with McNamara in Congress , " due to the feeling that he has arrogated powers not properly his , thereby reducing congressional review of defense issues to a rubber stamp . " Protests Marshall : " The dignity of man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not understand . "
