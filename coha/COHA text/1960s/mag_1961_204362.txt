THE man most widely held responsible for India 's conquest of Goa is not Jawaharlal Nehru , but Nehru 's abrasive , acerbic Defense Minister , Vengalil Krishnan Krishna Menon , who apparently provided the necessary push to overcome his master 's remaining scruples . With elections due in February , Nehru and Menon have been under continuous harassment from Indian leftists for not expelling the Portuguese " imperialists " and from moderates and rightists for ignoring Red China 's new incursions on India 's northern frontier . Acting against Goa was one way to cover up inaction against China . Moreover , Menon 's own parliamentary seat was in danger , and shrewd Indian political opinion held that Menon could only win if he made himself popular by " solving " the Goa situation . <P> Flamboyant , brusque , rude and arbitrary , as well as quick , capable and intelligent , Menon has long antagonized the West-and a great many of his own countrymen . As he flew to New York last week to uphold India 's case at the U.N. , he ran true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gandhi would have approved of the Goan invasion , Menon snapped : " Well , he 's not here , is he ? " A possible clash between Menon and the U.S. 's Adlai Stevenson from the rostrum of the General Assembly was avoided when the two men met in private , thus depriving the Assembly of a spectacular verbal display . <P> When he is on the attack , which is most of the time , Menon 's expression is ferretlike . Brain surgery last October for a blood clot deprived him of his elaborately curled silver locks , making his looks even fiercer . Though he has no known history of any leg ailment , he constantly brandishes a cane as if it were a weapon . A teetotaler and vegetarian , Menon , 64 , dresses with Savile Row impeccability at the U.N. ; at home in India , he wears a loose-fitting , collarless jibbah in which , says one Western observer , " he looks like Boris Karloff playing John the Baptist . " <P> In crackling ( and self-cultivated ) Oxonian accents , he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the world , giving them a leftist spin that invariably directs them against the West . Menon bends over backward to make allowances for the Communists , in 1956 voted against a U.N . resolution calling for the removal of Russian troops from beleaguered Hungary . He mouthed the Russian line at the Geneva conference on Laos last summer , has echoed Russia 's call for an uninspected nuclear test ban . Once criticized by the former Senator William F. Knowland for his consistent advocacy of Red China 's admission to the U.N. , Menon acidly counseled the California Republican to " visit a doctor , a psychopath , or somebody . "
