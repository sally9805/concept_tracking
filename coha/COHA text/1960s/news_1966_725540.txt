txt BUCHAREST , Rumania , May 18 ? Rumania denied today any intention of wanting to scuttle or leave the Warsaw Pact , but indicated opposition to Soviet demands ' for a strengthening of the alliance . " We believe the Warsaw Pact is sufficiently strong to meet present needs , " a ranking official said in an interview . At the 23d congress of the Soviet Communist party last April , Leonid I. Brezhnev , the ' party chief , called for a ' strengthening of the pact in ' response to what he called the rising threat from West Germany . Two other Communist leaders , Antonin Novotny of Czechoslovakia and Janos Kadar of Hungary , have voiced similar demands . " No measure to heighten the power of a military bloc or the aggressiveness of a bloc can contribute to a relaxation of tensions , " the Rumanian official said . " It can contribute only to an equilibrium of terror . " The official affirmed that it was Rumanian policy to work for the abolition of all military blocs : ' Duihe said this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As long as . the Mirth Atlantic Treaty Organization exists . he raid , there will have to be a Warsaw Pact . The diplomat denied reports from Moscow that Rumania had sent formal notes to the other pact members setting forth her views on the future of the alliance . Such reports belong " in the realm of pure fantasy and are deviild of - foundation , " he declared . In particular , he said , Rumania has not suggested to any other nation the withdrawal of Soviet troops from their territory . Such troops are stationed in East Germany , Hungary and Poland . Two Points Confirmed Soviet troops are stationed under bilateral agreements independent of the Warsaw Pact and this is none of Rumania 's concern , the official said . " The first principle of Rumanian policy is that we do not interfere in the affairs of another country and others do not interfere in ours , " he continued . The official did not deny two : of the principal points of RuH mania 's position on the Warsaw Pact that were said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a proposal that the command of the alliance be rotated among the members ? the Soviet Union , Poland , Czechoslovakia , East Germany , . Hungary , Rumania , Btilgaria and nominally , Albania . The commander so far has always been a Russian . The other was a demand that the use of nuclear arms from the territory of a member state be subject to the country 's consent . The principle of unanimity should prevail in all Warsaw Pact decisions . the official said . He stressed Rumania 's insistence that in peacetime the military forces of a. pact nation are fully under national control and that the commander of the pact forces does not exercise his functions except in time of war . East Europeans See No Crum By DAVID BL DER sinew : tiew York Thrice BELGRADE , May 18 ? East European diplomats here discount the idea that there is a crisis in relations between Ru-. mania ' and- vari ous organizations of the Soviet bloc . While they acknowledge that . the Bucharest Government has been intent on loosening ties ! with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lengthy ! process . " It is foolish to talk of Rumania 's withdrawing soon from the Warsaw Pact . " said one diplomat . " Swift and radical steps are not in the Rumanian style , " , commented another . The East Europeans are concerned that the Rumanians ' negative attitude toward bloc policies has hampered the work and interests of the majority of members . Apparently the Rumanians have used their veto power to defeat numerous proposals for joint activity hi the Warsaw Pact and in the Council of Ea : - nomic Mutual Assistance ( Comecon ) , Eastern Europe 's economic community . Poland 's Case Cited One diplomat put the problem this way : " For Poland , Comecon and its promise of economic integration and division of labor is a logical thing .
