On the Market <P> Sir : Why was President Kennedy so quick to act regarding the economic effects of steel prices , and so slow to even recognize the stock market decline ? If an economy is to be controlled , then the power that controls must at least be consistent-or is it O.K. to lose money but not O.K. to make money ? <P> JOHN C. ZACHARIS Claremont , Calif . <P> <P> Sir : <P> How cleverly your cover artist , Robert Vickrey , concealed the unhappy face with tears dropping from dollar-sign eyes in the June 8 issue . This was truly a remarkable stroke of genius in a magazine cover . I had read the issue before I even knew who was on the cover , I was so engrossed in that background work . <P> <P> MRS . JOHN DAVIDSON <P> Boston <P> Sir : <P> Jack Kennedy has found an asset to America in Academic Economist Heller : 8 billion more in debt ( temporarily , of course ) , gold reserves still declining , and the market down 150 points . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can hardly wait for the new tax reforms . <P> Now that our energetic leader has " this country moving again , " it would be nice to try a forward gear . <P> <P> EDWARD J. O'NEILL ' University of Cincinnati Cincinnati <P> Sir : <P> During the 1960 campaign , President Kennedy repeatedly promised to " get this country moving again . " Last week a great many U.S. voters and investors discovered rather belatedly and painfully that the vehicle he had used to implement this movement was a toboggan . <P> <P> MERLIN E. WOESNER , M.D. Glendale , Calif . <P> <P> Sir : Congratulations on your timely article on the bear market . If the New Frontier has its way , this will , however , never happen again . <P> The Government would insure investors against losses by guaranteeing to purchase securities at parity-the 1962 highs . The certificates will be stored in Billie Sol Estes ' cotton warehouses . Called STOC-CARE , the scheme will be a part of the social security program and cost only $15 a year . <P> <P> ROBERT R. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wept for the brave bulls . <P> Here they were gorging greedily on inflation until their grain was cut off . These were the privileged 8% entitled to buy 100 shares of Anything , Inc. and live happily on dividends ever after . <P> It all depends on whose bull is being gored . <P> We hired hands who have too much security but no securities still like that conservative old bromide that the world-and the stock market-does n't owe anybody a living . <P> <P> TOM PAYNE Wilmette , 111 . <P> <P> Sir : <P> I happen to be one of the many stockholders who lost some money in this market . But I can hardly blame President Kennedy or anybody else for my loss . Most of the people , including myself , wanted to make a " fast buck , " but it just does n't work out that way . <P> By the brokers ' own admission , prices of stocks were much too high , so why all the excitement when prices fall ? Nobody is forced into the market . <P> <P> FERNAND A. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> The article on the stock market was excellent . <P> <P> FRANK GREENWALL Chairman <P> National Starch &; Chemical Corp .
