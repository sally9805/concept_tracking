Americans who like to moan about the decline of U.S. theater and the rise of England 's can point for proof to Broadway : no fewer than five of its current plays originated in London. * And more would seem to be on the way : London playgoers now have no fewer than 45 plays and musicals to view , compared with Broadway 's 30 . <P> But appearances are deceiving . Accustomed since John Osborne 's Look Back in Anger ( 1956 ) to a seemingly endless blossoming of new theatrical talent , Londoners now are suffering through a period of drought . According to TIME Correspondent Horace Judson , the crackle of sere and yellow revivals is in the air . Agatha Christie 's The Mousetrap is still running in what is advertised as its " 16th mind-boggling year . " Among the musicals in town are a revival of The Boy Friend ( 1953 ) and an exhumation of The Desert Song ( 1926 ) . George Bernard Shaw has been revived at least ten times during the past three years ; Irene Worth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coward and Oscar Wilde are also being trotted out regularly ; last week The Importance of Being Earnest opened with Dame Flora Robson , and Hay Fever opens this week . Producers have even harked back to such antiques as The Bells , a Victorian melodrama in which Sir Henry Irving made his reputation , and John Galsworthy 's hoary Edwardian relic , Justice , a preachy treatise on crime and punishment . <P> Murky Waters . Of the only two new plays with any serious intellectual content to have opened in the West End this season , one-Peter Ustinov 's disappointing Halfway Up the Tree-closed in New York after only 72 performances . The other , Wise Child , has already closed in London , despite a strong cast headed by Sir Alec Guinness . A kinky , comic and slightly sinister play by Simon Gray , Wise Child presented Guinness as a criminal on the lam , disguised as a woman . He is being blackmailed by a weirdo youth who carries out the pretense of being his son ; the boy , in turn , is being pursued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed , " said the Times . <P> London has no Off Broadway ; the once adventurous Royal Court Theater , since the death of Artistic Director George Devine , has been taken over by a feeble clique of conventionally minor playwrights and directors . In this vacuum , the tiny semisuburban , underbudgeted Hampstead Theater Club has attracted critical notice with its recent productions of two stimulatingly offbeat dramas : Tennessee Williams ' Two Character Play ( TIME , Dec. 22 ) , and its currently featured Bakke 's Night of Fame by Playwright John McGrath . In the latter , the action takes place in the death cell of a U.S. prison , where Bakke , awaiting electrocution at midnight , ingeniously and humorously torments his guards , the warden and the priest who is making one last attempt to save his soul . McGrath has a rare English ear for U.S. speech and manner , and the actors , mostly unknowns , keep their American accents accurate and consistent .                   @ @
