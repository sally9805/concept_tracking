The countdown came over an amplified telephone hookup beamed from Cleveland . " One minute before race time , gentlemen , " said the starter . In Pasadena , Calif. , the three-man team starting from California Institute of Technology climbed into their red-and-white Volkswagen bus , which sported a sign reading " Socket-to-me . " Across the continent , in Cambridge , Mass. , a two-man competing team slipped into their modified white Corvair . Said the starter : " Get ready to throw your switches . " Then , with a hum rather than the usual roar , the Great Electric-Car Race was off . <P> The idea for the race came from Caltech Physics Graduate Wally Rippel , 23 , whose experiences with Los Angeles ' eye-smarting smog had inspired him to create a fumeless electric car two years ago . When he heard that students at M.I.T. were developing a similar electric model-as are several auto companies , including Ford , General Motors and American Motors-he challenged them to a transcontinental race . The aim of the operation : to stimulate interest in non-air-pollutant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the two cars , heading in opposite directions , to follow the same route , which would have a total of 53 stations where their batteries could be recharged . The floor of Caltech 's minibus was covered with 20 lead-cobalt batteries , on top of which were pads where off-duty drivers slept . M.I.T. 's team borrowed a set of $20,000 nickel-cadmium batteries . Characteristically , the engineers used linear equations to work out a handicap system . <P> Neither team had easy going . On the second day out , as Caltech 's Rippel approached Seligman , Ariz. , he downshifted at 40 m.p.h. and heard a sickening crunch . Twenty-three hours passed before a new engine could be flown in from Michigan by sponsoring Electric Fuel Propulsion Inc . At Amarillo , Texas , an electronic nightmare of popping fuses and exploding diodes cost another four hours plus some added penalties for replacements . <P> The faster M.I.T. car , which could make up to 60 m.p.h. between chargings , v. 55 miles for Caltech , had even more troubles . About 950 miles from the starting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a day to revive it . On the road , 200 Ibs. of ice had to be carried to cool the battery . Says M.I.T. 's Jim Martin : " It was like driving an iceberg . " Then , at Victorville , Calif. , the car 's engine idled at twice its normal r.p.m.s , blew up on its block , and had to be towed 130 miles to the Pasadena finish line . It got there a full 37 hours before Caltech 's Volkswagen bus limped into Cambridge . But the Caltech team had made the trip with fewer penalties . As a result , the adjusted finishing time was 210 hours and 3 minutes for Cal tech , 210 hours and 30 minutes for M.I.T. An ordinary auto spouting its noxious fumes , of course , would have made the trip in at least half the time .
