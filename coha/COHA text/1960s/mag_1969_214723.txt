THREE CHEERS FOR THE PARACLETE by Thomas Keneally. 240 pages . Viking . $4.95 . <P> There are those who see the aggiornamento of Pope John XXIII as an erosion of the ancient rock of St. Peter , and those who see it as nothing less than a revival of all Christendom . It was likely that sooner or later these conflicting views would be explored in fiction ; it is only strange that the first credible and moving novelistic exposition of the crisis of faith among clergy and laity that followed Vatican II should come out of Australia . <P> Young Novelist Thomas Keneally showed his talents in Bring Larks and Heroes ( TIME , Aug. 16 ) , which bore on the special subject of colonial servitude . Despite its title , Three Cheers for the Paraclete is less special . Modern Sydney , where the story takes place , is not remote ; indeed , its population , one-sixth Irish Catholic , lends the quality of life there something of the familiar , built-in tensions of Boston or Philadelphia . <P> Keneally is what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not take his final vows . Thus his fictional priests are drawn from knowledge , not research . His protagonist , James Maitland , with a fresh doctorate from Louvain , is a 29-year-old priest teaching history in a Catholic House of Studies . Set off as it is against the Mediterranean glitter of Sydney 's splendid harbor and the sunburned hedonists who inhabit it , this comfortless , twilit gothic barracks with an " eczema of stained glass , " emphasizes one of the book 's controlling ironies . For Maitland fits neither world , though he can swim like a fish in the troubled waters of theology . <P> Going by the Book . He has written a book ( pseudonymously and without episcopal imprimatur ) called The Meanings of God , and it is his undoing . He explains the work as " a history of the God of the institutions , pulpits , political parties and wreath-laying generals . It is a history of the abuse of the notion of God and of its place in the motives of modern man . " <P> As such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boyle , a local L.C.L. ( Leading Catholic Layman ) , who heads something called the Knights of St. Patrick and has all the tricks of chancery politics at his blunt fingertips . Boyle has talked the Archbishop of Sydney into asking Maitland to write a refutation . It would be a refutation of his own book , but the time has passed when Maitland can possibly admit to his own duplicity . It can be seen from this exquisitely complex confrontation that Keneally is far from making a loaded brief for the modernist clergy against the hard-core traditionalists . There are grievous sins on both sides . <P> To Maitland , God is not so much a presence as an " absence in the heart , " and faith is a yearning to fill the void . His natural enemies in the faith are the Irish dogmatists for whom God is not an unknowable otherness but a " kinsman " - in his most ignoble form honorary president of an Irish friendly society . The ecclesiastical embodiment of the dogmatist faith is Dr. Costello , a clerical bully who heads the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bishop-size before the reader 's eyes .
