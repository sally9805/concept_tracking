Cutty and Zutty were there . So were Peanuts , Woody , Yank , Wingy , Red , Pee Wee and Willie the Lion. * Sammy Davis Jr . was supposed to come , but he pleaded " fatigue " at the last minute and did n't show . Just as well : he would have seemed out of place at this reunion of jazz 's elder statesmen , come to celebrate one of their own . <P> They called it " A Salute to Eddie Condon , " the famed , feisty guitarist who has reigned for some 25 years as public defender of " old style " Dixieland . Staged at midnight in Manhattan 's Carnegie Hall , the event had all the makings for a Great Moment in jazz history . Bob Crosby and Johnny Mercer came in from the West Coast . Woody Herman and his 16-piece band were bussed uptown between shows at a Times Square jazz emporium . All told , 43 musicians gathered to pay homage , many of them the founding fathers of " hot jazz , " ragtime 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the mid-1920s . <P> Out of the Cellar . Trumpeter Wingy Manone got the audience of 1,800 tapping their feet with a blistering Tailgate Ramble . Trumpeter Billy Butterfield chimed in with a sweet and solid delivery of Singing the Blues . Crosby led ten enlistees through a lively , give-and-go session of Royal Garden Blues . But betwixt and between , le jazz hot tended to run lukewarm , and when it was over at 3:20 a.m. , the Great Moment had never quite happened . M.C.s Crosby and Mercer did their best to keep the music flowing as freely as the whisky backstage , but the profusion of talent was largely wasted in the confusion of an erratic format . <P> Condon was the first to insist that Dixieland jazz was worthy of being lifted out of the dingy cellars and onto the concert stage . He helped inspire the whole cult of jazz critics , who could spin out columns on the flittering trumpet solos of Bobby Hackett . To prove his point , in 1942 Condon promoted a highly successful series of jazz " concerts " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dominance , Condon doggedly ran his own club in Greenwich Village . He organized the bands , promoted Dixieland indefatigably , arranged for the recording sessions . <P> " Up and Leapin ' . " At Carnegie Hall , Condon appeared to lead his crusty cronies through some " up and leapin ' music . " " Eddie 's the guy who got us the jobs when we needed them , " says Bass Player Bobby Haggart . The Carnegie Hall " salute " was , in fact , a benefit for Condon , 58 , who will use the proceeds ( $2,700 ) to help pay his hospital bills for a recent operation . " The youngest guy at Carnegie 's Hole , " says Condon , " was the doorman . There are not many young guys around who are interested in playing the old unconfined jazz . Music has survived some strange invasions but we 've done an awfully good job of being relevant for quite a few years . We 've raised some hell in our time . " As an elder statesman , Condon is probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something of a renaissance . At debutante balls and bar mitzvahs , on campuses and at country-club dances , Dixieland bands are discoursing anew on an old theme that Eddie Condon kept alive . <P>
