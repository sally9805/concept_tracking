In keeping with its subdued editorial policy , the Christian Science Monitor announced a modicum of change last week with a minimum of fanfare . Over coffee and pastry in Manhattan 's Plaza Hotel , Editor in Chief Erwin D. Canham and other Monitor executives described the newspaper 's new look to assembled newsmen . <P> The paper 's eight-column page has been reduced to five , its 7-point type enlarged to nine point . Black column rules have been removed , leaving wide swatches of white space . A pair of capsule news columns have been added . " Focus , " appearing daily in the left-hand column of the front page , will summarize trends in politics , business , sports , science and the arts ; " The News-Briefly , " which appears on page 2 , will capsule the day 's events . With the addition of twelve reporters and some editorial shifts , Canham expects staffers to be freer than ever to write stories with a personal viewpoint , " producing a paper that will last . " <P> Canham hopes that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past 2 years ( TIME , Jan. 8 ) , will boost the Monitor 's sagging circulation and put the paper , now subsidized by the Mother Church , on a self-sustaining basis . Other changes are planned , though one area of the paper is sure to remain the same : liquor and cigarette ads will continue to be banned , along with pictures of people smoking or drinking . Obituaries and the word death will appear as rarely as ever .
