The Lifeman is listening to the Expert , who is just back from a trip to Florence and is showing off his newly gathered bits of intelligence . " And I was glad to see with my own eyes , " the Expert says , " that this left-wing Catholicism is definitely on the increase in Tuscany . " To which the Lifeman replies : " Yes , but not in the South . " <P> Friends and admirers of British Humorist Stephen Potter , who died in London last week at 69 , will recognize Lifeman 's rejoinder as the Canterbury Block , a devastating all-purpose ploy . " Yes , but not in the South , " as Potter went on to explain in Some Notes on Lifemanship , is a phrase that " with slight adjustments , will do for any argument about any place , if not about any person . It is an impossible comment to answer . " Lifemanship can take many other directions . One gifted practitioner , cited by Potter in the same volume , dedicated his book " TO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glorious gift of sight may be restored to her " - thereby precasting as villains any critics unfeeling enough to pan the book . They could not know , to be sure , that Phyllis was the Lifeman 's 96-year-old great-grandmother . <P> Annoying Ploy . British humor can be highly perishable , and its point is often so obscure as to defy detection - except perhaps , by the British themselves . But Stephen Potter 's wry and understated advice on how to win games , including the game of life , with losing hands endeared him to readers on both sides of the Atlantic . Any of his satirical books , from the first ( Gamesmanship , or The Art of Winning Games <P> Without Actually Cheating ) to the last ( Golfmanship ) , can easily be absorbed at one sitting . In any of them , it is impossible to miss Potter 's point : that anyone can triumph over all the pompous types who hog the center of the stage - the long-winded bore , the authority , the physician , the superior competitor . How ? By using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the victim scarcely knows he has been pinked . Thus one day , playing golf with a friend , Potter asked " a bit of a favor " on the third hole . But he delayed revealing what he wanted until the 16th . By this time his companion , anxiously speculating on how many pounds-ten ? 100 ? - Potter was going to touch him for , was dubbing every other shot . As it developed , all Potter requested was the loan of a razor blade , a gambit that ruined the remainder of his friend 's game . " Relief , " added the author , " creates a tendency to pull . " <P> " An intensely annoying ploy often used by doctors , " Potter wrote , " is to treat Patient as if he were as ignorant of all anatomical knowledge as a child of four . " He will , for example , " refer to the blood corpuscles as ' the white fellows and the red chaps , ' " and will inquire of a constipated lady patient : " How are the bow-wows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonsense before it starts , Potter advised , is to cast doubt on the doctor 's professionalism : " I am , I suppose , right in calling you Doctor ? "
