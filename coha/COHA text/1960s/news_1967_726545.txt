txt The Eisenhower plan for cooling Middle East tensions is ? behind the scenes  --  making impressive headway . The plan , roughly , calls for the building of three very large nuclear desalting plants in the Middle East as a means of providing tremendous quantities of water to both Israel and the Arab countries . President Johnson has been conferring by telephone with former President Eisenhower on the plan , conceived by Mr. Eisenhower and worked out in detail by Admiral Lewis L. Strauss , former chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission . Thus , the presidential initiative required to carry the plan forward seems to be in the making . Matter of timing ' Further , presidential interest in the plan has been conveyed to Sen. Howard H. Baker Jr . ( R ) of Tennessee who , in turn , is initiating legislation to get the project moving . Senator Baker has written President Johnson about his intention to push legislation for the plants in the Senate . He made the point that the bill would be bipartisan in sponsorship . On Aug. 23 the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " was considering " the plan and that it now was a " matter of timing " in terms of the diplomatic steps that the administration would have to initiate . The desalting plants , as envisioned , would result in : 1 . New jobs for many refugees . 2 . An enormous increase in the agricultural productivity of existing wastelands . 3 . A broad base for cooperation between the Israeli and Arab governments . The plan is based on the finding that if sufficient quantities of fresh water can be furnished to the arid lands of the Middle East , chronic food shortages can be ended and meaningful work for residents and refugees can be made available . Lure to industry Admiral Strauss 's vast experience with the Atomic Energy Commission has led him to conclude that three very large desalting plants are both technically feasible and economically attractive as the means to provide the great quantities of fresh water the plan envisions . Two of the installations would be located at appropriate points on the Mediterranean coast of Israel and a smaller one at the northern end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The first plant would be designed to produce daily the equivalent of some 950 million gallons of fresh water  --  more than the combined flow of the three main tributaries , which make up the Jordan River . This plant would also produce an amount of power which , though in excess of the present needs of the area , would attract industry and would be used to pump the fresh water into the water-starved areas of Israel , Jordan , and other Arab countries  --  perhaps even including part of Egypt east of the Nile Valley . Operation of the plants would be made the responsibility of the International Atomic Energy Agency , of which each of the major belligerents , fortunately , is a - ber . To finance the project , Admiral Strauss proposes that a corporation be formed with a charter resembling that of Comsat , with the government subscribing to half of the stock , the balance to be offered for public subscription in the security markets of the world .               @ @ @ @ @ @
