THE editors of TIME began the week with well-laid plans for a cover story on the winner of the British election . While covering both sides right down to the ballot box , the London Bureau weighed in 48 hours before the polls opened with a firm judgment that Labor 's Harold Wilson would win . In New York , the WORLD staff was inclined to agree , but with knowledge born of experience remained flexible and ready for a narrow victory by either side . It turned out to be a week when flexibility , always the journalist 's best stance amid breaking news , was nothing less than a critical necessity . <P> First of the big stories to break in the hottest week of international news in years was the scandal in the White House . Then in quick succession came the overthrow in Moscow and the bomb in China . As one big story piled on top of another , about all that journalists reporting by the minute or the hour or the day could do , as one editor said ( see PRESS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In a position to look at the news at greater length and depth , TIME correspondents around the world and writers and editors in New York set about the more difficult but more rewarding task of studying , analyzing and assessing the meaning of the startling events . As the stories were developing , the editors decided that <P> Artist Bernard Safran 's finely painted cover of Harold Wilson would have to give way , so it became a reduced black and white engraving , and joined photographs of the new Russian leaders and a picture of President Johnson taken as the news of the scandal was breaking-all four superimposed on the background of an atomic explosion . <P> In addition to these nation-rattling events , there was other hard news to be assessed-for example , the Russian space troika ( SCIENCE ) , and the spectacular U.S. success in the Olympics ( SPORT ) . With all that , TIME 'S editors-by the very nature of their mission-went right on with a full schedule of stories on another level , such as ART 'S critique of " op art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MEDICINE 'S report on the use of animal corneas for transplant into the human eye ; RELIGION 'S study of an ecumenical milestone , the first Bible translation to combine the labors of Protestant , Catholic and Jewish scholars . <P> When big news is breaking fast , TIME 'S editors believe in taking the time and the intensive effort to explain what it means . At the same time , they know they must not neglect the stories of trends and developments that may not make such black headlines but nevertheless add understanding and meaning to life . <P>
