CHARLES DE GAULLE had a genius for infuriating Americans on questions large and little . He frustrated grand designs for transatlantic harmony and military cooperation : he withdrew French forces from NATO , ordered U.S. troops out of France and built a costly independent nuclear deterrent , the force de frappe . Though a giant of his times , he could be petty on the smallest matter ; three years ago , he refused to permit the annual memorial service for U.S. Army Sergeant Larry Kelly , fatally wounded in the liberation of Paris , to be held at the Invalides , the French national shrine that was its customary site . For a time , while the U.S. tried to keep relations between the two countries from getting worse , American tourism in France fell off , and an occasional U.S. restaurateur made news by dumping his supply of French wines into the gutter . <P> Yet even before De Gaulle fell last week , the Franco-American freeze was thawing . The U.S. bombing halt in North Viet Nam , coupled with the opening of peace talks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ De Gaulle 's own position lost some of its majesty , both within and outside France , after the student riots a year ago and the autumn monetary crisis that almost forced devaluation of the franc . De Gaulle had courted the Soviet Union during a triumphal tour in 1966 and had implicitly excluded the U.S. from his often-stated vision of a Europe " united from the Atlantic to the Urals . " But his policy of dtente with the U.S.S.R. suffered a violent setback when Soviet tanks invaded Czechoslovakia , and French critics of NATO suddenly fell silent . Rapprochement was further advanced by Richard Nixon 's European trip in February , which he used to affirm both his personal admiration for the general and the continuing U.S. friendship for France . <P> Increased Flexibility . At the time , Nixon 's tour seemed to be little more than a welcome gesture of reconciliation with Western European leaders who felt neglected by the Johnson Administration 's preoccupation with Asia . The new U.S. President had no way of knowing that De Gaulle 's political demise was imminent but , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With De Gaulle 's departure , Europe 's statesmen must reappraise their direction . Nixon 's meetings with the British , the Germans , the Belgians and the Italians , which seemed perfunctory at the time , may now turn out to have prepared the way for a significant U.S. consultative role in the shaping of Europe after De Gaulle . <P> President Nixon responded to the news of De Gaulle 's defeat by writing a letter of regret and repeating his invitation to the general to visit the U.S. , now as a private citizen . Said Nixon : " I have greatly valued the frank and comprehensive exchanges of views it has been my privilege to have with you . " U.S. foreign policy experts responded cautiously to De Gaulle 's debacle . " We 've got a whole new ball game , " said one , but nobody is yet certain of the game 's exact rules . One thing at least is clear : De Gaulle 's resignation will not automatically produce fundamental or necessarily rapid change .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
