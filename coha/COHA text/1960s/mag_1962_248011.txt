In the thirteen years since the plastic LP era began , no classical record has exhibited the sales allure of such old champions as Enrico Caruso 's 78-r.p.m. performance of Vesti la giubba from Pagliacci , which sold well over a million copies . But last week Pianist Van Cliburn joined Caruso and a handful of other 78-r.p.m. giants , became the first artist to sell 1,000,000 classical LPs . His recording : Tchaikovsky 's Piano Concerto No. 1 , which captured first prize for him in the spring of 1958 in Moscow 's International Tchaikovsky Competition and which he recorded two weeks later in empty Carnegie Hall , Russia 's Kiril Kondrashin conducting . <P> Arturo Toscanini 's LP recording of the Beethoven Ninth Symphony has sold 600,000 , but the only real rivals to Cliburn-Tchaikovsky are preserved on old-fashioned shellac . Among the million-selling 78s : Jalousie , performed by Arthur Fiedler and the Boston Pops Orchestra , Pianist Jose Iturbi in Chopin 's Polonaise in A-flat and Debussy 's Clair de Lune , Leopold Stokowski 's recording of Tales from the Vienna Woods .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
