@#  | Should Wives Work The breeze of controversy continues to blow . The printed page and the air waves keep carrying the pros and cons . But the question of whether a young wife should work is one which only the young wife and her husband have the right to answer . If the husband is opposed to having a working wife , the wife should not work . End of statement . But before he takes his position , it might be well for him to review the reasons why so many married women are working in these United States . There are more married women in our labor force than single women . Surprising ? Not really , when you examine the reasons . Many wives work because the money is needed . With today 's cost of living , many young husbands are not yet earning enough for a comfortable ( not luxurious , just comfortable ) way of life . Watching every penny is n't fun , nor does it create the relaxed climate in which a new marriage can most readily make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purse strings enough to make all the difference between penury and pleasure . Many women work because they have talent or training which just ca n't be shut off like a faucet . The skilled nurse , the teacher , the researcher , the secretary . . . they 've all contributed constructively and would like to go on doing so . If you want to measure the importance of their work , try to imagine a society in which . they 've all been removed from their jobs . What would happen to hospitals and schools and shops and business offices without them ? How many men who oppose their wives ' working would willingly give up their secretaries ? There 's still another reason why many women want to continue working after they marry . They enjoy their work . Holding a job that interests you is fun , and why should men have the exclusive right to this privilege ? The young husband has taken all these points into consideration and he still feels that his wife should not take a job ? Then the wife should not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Next month I 'll talk about the working wife who has a very young child . One Planet at a Time ! IN If you knew a woman who planned to buy a mink coat while she had no decent dress and only one pair of run-down shoes , what would you think of her ? Well , does n't our interest in reaching the moon seem somewhat parallel , when you stop to think of the poverty that still blights the lives of so many millions of people on our own planet ? Women at the Wheel Never let it be said I would even imply that women are a superior sex . Or vice versa . I think women are people and any so-called " battle of the sexes " is as passe as the bustle . But I ca n't help one tiny smile at a recent report from the Martin Company in Baltimore , acting for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration . After a year 's experiments they found that " women may be better space drivers than men . . . they usually catch on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's stop smiling now and prove that this ability can be harnessed for mundane and practical purposes . Let 's apply it to driving a car . Last year , 61/2 million new automobiles were registered in the United States . New York State registered more than 5 million cars . Records show that in 1901 ( the first year New York required that cars be registered ) , the grand total of $954 enriched the treasury , compared with the many millions collected last year . But with this mushroom growth comes the grim prediction that . within the next four years , one person in every eleven in this country will be killed or injured in traffic accidents . Does this mean that you should drive or ride in fear and trembling ? On the contrary , you should realize that the relaxed driver is less accident-prone than the supercautious creeper . What are the danger signals which say do n't drive today ? or , if you must drive , be truly careful ? The signals include : Excessive fatigue . bad temper , more than one drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it said that a person 's true character shows up in a card game . Where it really shows up is behind a wheel . Some ' people drive recklessly and with no regard for others , some drive courteously and have complete consideration for others . There is no accurate gauge for measuring these qualities and their effect on safe driving , but tests have proved the validity of the belief that men and ..... . VVVYrh  | women drive exactly as they live . Young people , in their late teens and twenties , have the saddest safety record of all . The figures are not divided by sex , but is n't it fair to assume that the blame should be shared ? Since the best part of your lives lies ahead , is n't this the time to change those unhappy statistics by harnessing potential space-flight ability to your everyday driving ? Perfect Wedding Gift If you could line up all the wedding presents received by any one bride , you 'd find many beautiful and useful gifts and a couple of albino elephants . Right ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? or give ? when you want to spend a small amount of money and a large amount of thought . Make up a package of all the things a new home ca n't do without . What ? A ball of twine , Scotch tape , a pair of kitchen shears , a box of elastic bands , a package of small pads for marketing lists , a box of sharpened pencils , a tiny tool kit , some pushpins , a new telephone-address book for both husband and wife , a box of kitchen matches , an extension cord , a gadget to unscrew jar lids , and anything else you 've found you ca n't get along without . I 've been reading an article in a reputable news magazine that seems to be pushing a certain conservative senator for the ' 64 presidential nomination . ( Yes , already ! ) They talk about the way " the college generation flocks to hear him " and spend two pages telling about the " overflow audiences , cheers and banner waving " of his " campus following . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentleman and his influence that they failed to mention the name of one single college where all this enthusiasm bubbled . A fundamental rule of journalism is : Tell who , what , where and when . Without these facts , no story can be considered authentic or valuable . All of which reminds me of the unsigned letters that reach the desk of every editor . If it 's worth saying , it 's worth signing . Anyone ashamed to put his or her name on a letter had better not send it . If you want to criticize , do it , but give your victim a chance to answer and state his side . I can assure you that editors welcome their readers ' reactions whether they be good or bad , but unsigned letters are dropped in the wastebasket , known in the trade as the " circular file . " ?
