&gt;Six days after announcing that an unheralded Soviet discus thrower had set a new world record of 202 ft. 2 in. , Moscow trumpeted still more exultant news : Broad Jumper Igor Ter-Ovanesyan , 24 , who placed third in the 1960 Olympics , had sailed 27 ft. 3 in. during a meet in Armenia , thus smashing the 27-ft. 1-in. world record set by U.S. Olympic Champion Ralph Boston in last year 's U.S.Soviet track meet in Moscow . Preparing for the fourth U.S.-Soviet track meet in Palo Alto , Calif , next month the Russians had two other new records to announce in the ladies ' division . At a meet in Leipzig , East Germany , muscular Shotputter Tamara Press had boosted her record with the 8.8-lb. women 's shot to 60 ft. 10 in. ; at the same meet , Broad Jumper Tatyana Shelkanova broke her own record with a leap of 21 ft. 5 in . <P> &gt; ' ' It looked like the whole ocean was coming up in slow motion when he came out of the water . Every time he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water . " On an annual fishing trip to Cape Hatteras . N.C .. Gary Stukes , 37 , a sales engineer from Morristown . N.J. , had hooked into an angler 's dream : a huge blue marlin with a bill like a baseball bat and a temperament to match . In the first few seconds the leaping , head-shaking fish ripped off 400 yds. of 130-lb. test line ; it took another 1 hr. 20 min. to get the giant blue into the boat . It measured an even 14 ft. from bill to scythelike tail , and weighed 810 Ibs. -a new world record , 30 Ibs. heavier than the previous record caught three years ago off San Juan , P.R . <P> &gt; One drive curved over onto the wrong fairway , and his irons caught the rough with distressing regularity . But Richard Davies , 31-year-old Pasadena , Calif. , real estate man , still managed to beat Welshman John Povall one up in the 36-hole match play final , thus becoming the twelfth American to win the British Amateur golf championship , second only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> &gt; Stroking at a low beat with power and precision . Cornell 's twice-beaten varsity crew pulled past the rest of the 13-boat field about a mile out and raced through the final two miles to win the grueling 60th Intercollegiate Rowing Association championship two lengths ahead of previously undefeated Washington on Syracuse 's Onondaga Lake . The Big Red will probably race next against one of Soviet Russia 's always strong eight-oared crews at the Fourth of July Independence Day Regatta in Philadelphia .
