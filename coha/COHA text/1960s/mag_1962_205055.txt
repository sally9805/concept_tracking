Since the days when the Yankee clippers sailed to the ports of the Orient , Americans have had a nodding acquaintance with the civilization of China . Yet the study of Chinese art is still in its infancy . A year ago , the citizens of five U.S. cities , visiting a show sent by the government of Nationalist China , discovered the magnificence of the old Peking Palace Museum treasures . Last week another dazzling and instructive exhibition-though inevitably smaller-went on display at Manhattan 's Pierpont Morgan Library . <P> The collector responsible for it is a Manhattanite named John M. Crawford Jr. , who has been using his ample inheritance from a West Virginia manufacturer of oil-drilling equipment to build the finest collection of Chinese paintings and calligraphy in private Western hands since that of the famed Charles Freer . <P> A Dot Is a Rock . Probably no artists ever followed so severe a technique as the Chinese , and no instrument of art has ever been devised as sensitive as the Chinese brush . In calligraphy , no matter how many kinds of strokes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one convention , " a dot should resemble a rock falling from a high cliff . A horizontal stroke should resemble a formation of cloud stretching 1,000 miles . A vertical stroke should resemble a dried vine stem a myriad years old . " It is one of the virtues of the collection that there is such an emphasis on calligraphy , for the calligrapher 's art was especially admired ; as each stroke went into the building of a character and each character flowed onto the next , a man 's inner being was revealed . <P> The paintings had a similar rhythm , almost musical in their surges of line and empty spaces of pure silence . They required the mastery of the same calligraphic stroke , from the tight lines of the academic seal characters to the freer lines of " grass script . " Color , when used , was often so fragile that it looked as if it could be blown away . <P> Some artists in the Crawford collection could suggest the universe with a few lines ; others explored the world in microscopic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , most painters repeated the themes and composition of the great masters even centuries after the masters were dead . If Western art has tended to progress in bursts of genius , Chinese art has tended to flow . Each time of greatness has passed onto the next its heritage intact . <P> From Emperor to Monk . The Crawford collection ranges from pages out of ancient albums to calligraphic couplets , from spectacular wall scrolls to hand scrolls that were meant to be seen only a few inches at a time . There are scenes of jolly drunkenness and of men contemplating a waterfall , paintings ranging from lofty landscapes to spare sprays of bamboo , the nearest thing in nature to calligraphy . One 22-ft. hand scroll showing a series of great palaces is a work of art so intricate that it seems like a series of fantasies by some Oriental Piranesi . Yet recent excavations in Red China have shown that the fountain and palaces really did exist at Sian ( old Ch'ang-an ) . <P> The artists themselves knew no class .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
