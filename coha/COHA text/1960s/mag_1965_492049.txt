O n Easter Sunday in every *trch in the land , a man to whom this grace has been given stands in the pulpit to tell again the story of the dead Christ risen in glory from the tomb . Yet how can he , a. minister of God but still a man like other men , make meaningful to his people this great mystery of the risen Christ ? How can he convey to these seeking , doubting , fearful , anguished men and women in the pews the " breadth , and length , and depth , and height " of Christ 's love in words that will dispel their doubts and quench . their fears ? Above all , how can he , Sunday after Sunday , amid the clamor of a. complex and changing world , relate Christ 's teachings to their harassed , materialistic lives , so that the emptiness of their existence may be filled with the fulness of God " ? Even though he should , in one minister 's words , " preach like Moses and comfort like Christ , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must exhort like Paul in his efforts to persuade his people that they as well as he must bear a Christian witness to the world . This is perhaps his hardest task . The half-doubting , half-believing churchgoers of today do not feel the deep conviction that led the early Christians gladly to risk their lives for the faith . They want comfort , not challenge , and counsel in time of trouble . They want therapeutic sermons that do not strike at the roots of their deep prejudices . They want a sincere smile and a hearty handshake and an assurance that " God loves you , and so do I. " For all these things they look to their minister , demanding of him a. wisdom , a warmth , a willingness and a zeal that he , being made of the same flawed clay as they , does not possess . The result , for him , is often frustration , a sense of inadequacy , a dread of things left undone that ought to have been done . But Christianity is a triumphant religion , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pulpit , or driving about on his routine duties , or lying weary in bed after a long and trying day , he knows that sooner or later he will hear an inner voice assuring him that he is not wasting his life . Then his sense of inadequacy falls away , and he no longer doubts his calling , but shares with the Rev. Silas Kessler of Hastings , Nebr. , the exuberant affirmation : " Being a minister today is the most exciting , challenging job in the world . It is exhausting . It can be frustrating ; it is tilled with harassments and distractions . But I would n't swap places with any other man . and there is no other job in which I could be half so happy . " I ?

Yet no one knows better than Guthrie Speers that he is in a serious business . " Maybe you 've been working with a husband and wife for months , trying to keep them from breaking up their marriage and ruining the lives of their kids . " says Speers. a Presbyterian minister in New Canaan , Conn . " Then one night the gal calls you up , sounding happy . and says . ' Come on over . We 're back together again . and it looks as if we 're going to make it . ' That 's a great moment . That makes everything worthwhile . " Then some morning you pick up the paper , and somebody else you 've been trying to help has gone out and shot himself in the head . Then you feel helpless , hollow , miserable . " Again and again , in interviews with ministers of every major Protestant denomination in every part of the country , came this same sad confession of inadequacy . Whether he preaches from a rural pulpit or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parish minister is a man assailed by the fear that he can not effectively cope with the staggering human problems he encounters . And this sense of inadequacy breeds guilt . " You know that every time one of the sheep bleats. you ought to go see what is the matter , " says the Rev. Hugh Saussy Jr .. the big , soft-spoken rector of Holy Innocents ' Episcopal Church in Atlanta . " But you 'd much prefer at that moment to tell the sheep to go get lost , and you feel guilty about this . The phone rings at three o'clock in the morning . and you do n't answer it . You feel guilty . even though you know it is probably some drunk who for an hour will sob in your ear the story of how a cruel world has maltreated him . Every time ministers get together you hear over and over again the same cracked record-1 feel inadequate . . . inadequate . . . inadequate . ' It 's our theme song . " This sense of powerlessness comes as a shock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with sanguine expectations . Above all . he will be the pastor-shepherd ? " Daddy in the pulpit " ? teaching his people the great truths of the Gospel , soothing their fears , scolding them for their failure to take Christianity into their working lives and prove its meaning there . He sees himself as the priest before the altar . transmitting through symbol , gesture and the solemn beauty of the liturgy the great mysteries of the sacraments that language alone can not convey . He sees himself as the good friend , sharing his parishioners ' joys at births , marriages and graduations , and as the gentle pastor , holding their hands in illness . comforting them in their hours of sorrow , counseling them in their time of trouble . He Finds himself doing all these things , but in an atmosphere of such distraction that nothing gets done as well as his heart tells him it should . He discovers that the roles he enjoys most  --  those Of preacher , pastor and priest  --  are the ones to which he can give the least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an administrator . a mimeograph operator , a part-time janitor and handyman , an organizer of committees , a club chairman , and a settler of petty squabbles among the good ladies of the altar guild .

I le knows if he is to deepen his understanding of the modern world and the church 's role in it , he must read the great thinkers of the contemporary church Barth , Tillich , Niebuhr  --  and give back their wisdom to his flock in simple form --  " Tillich for tots , " as one minister put it . But he also knows , to his shame , that he sometimes weakly submits to those who mistrust intellect . When his secretary warns him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the board of stewards is on the way to his study , he hastily puts a volume of K terkegaard oil of sight and scatters Over his desk top papers dealing with the budget . " In America we worship the businessman , " says Dow Kirkpatrick , who thunders his prophetic sermons from the famed free pulpit of the First Methodist Church in Evanston , Ill . " All other professionals  --  preachers . teachers , doctors , lawyers -- are measured against the yardstick of how well they emulate the businessman in their work habits . If I am around the house all day in a sport shirt . this is heresy . This is bad business . I should be at my desk at eight-thirty . " The " businessman-of-the-cloth " is one aspect of the stereotype that Protestants force upon a minister . They have their own concept of what a pastor should he , and they lovingly hut firmly press each man into the mold . They cram you into a straitjacket , " says one minister , " that neither strengthens nor upholds you , " Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a pedestal , shut him out of their lives in all matters not pertaining to church or civic good works , feel uncomfortable in his presence and fall silent or titter nervously when he approaches . It is almost as if there were an invisible wall between the preacher and his flock . According to the Rev. Clayton Bell , handsome , curly-haired young pastor of a Presbyterian church in Dothan , Ala. , the wall was built by the old nay-saying ministers of an earlier day . " The embarrassment men feel in the presence of a preacher . " Bell says , " is a hangover from an outmoded Puritanism which measured piety by what a man did not do  --  drink , smoke , cuss . gamble  --  rather than by the positive Christian qualities of compassion , honesty and brotherhood . " Still the separation exists , in the layman 's mind if not in the minister 's , and despite all the duties that bring him in constant contact with people , the average preacher feels a deep inner loneliness , a sense of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says the Rev. Sam Yarnell . once Tennessee Methodism 's most noted country preacher , " you come to realize that you do n't have any contacts with the men of your church except in official meetings . You lind that your only close friends are other ministers . And in the Methodist Church , the last man in the world you want to let your hair down with is another preacher . He may be your district superintendent someday , or a bishop . " In many small and seemingly inconsequential ways the minister resists the stereotype , struggles to retain his identity as a person as well as a parson . The Rev. William Hinson , lean , athletic , hawk-nosed pastor of the Fort Lauderdale , Fla. , Baptist Church , rides about on his day off with his wife Betty and their two children , on a bicycle built for four , dressed like any tourist in walking shorts and a long-billed fishing cap . In New Canaan . Conn. , Guthrie Speers rides that bicycle with the little clergyman emblem on it and wears his red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the fire truck with the New Canaan fire department , which he feels gives him status with the kids . His wife Susan describes these mild departures from the ministerial norm , particularly the red deerstalker cap , as " Guthrie 's village-idiot syndrome . " " There is a little ham in every minister , " the Reverend Mr. Speers replies . I n Tucson , Ariz. , the Rev. Paul David Sholin , pastor of St. Mark 's Presbyterian Church , lean , compassionate , wrinkled beyond his years , rebukes the stereotype by conforming to it beyond his congregation 's expectations . He wears a turnaround collar because , he says . " they 'd put it on me anyway , in their minds . That leaves me free to break the accepted pattern in any way I choose . " The methods he chooses are mild , but they give him satisfaction . He drives a white Lincoln Continental ( " I have a friendly Ford dealer in my congregation " ) , smokes a curve-stemmed brier . and is not embarrassed to be seen drinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work so hard to break down the stereotype ? Part of the reason is the simple need to be included in human society and accepted as a person . But there is a far more pressing reason . The stereotype gets in the minister 's way . It makes it all but impossible for him to communicate with other men , to speak effectively to their condition , to convey Christ into their lives . For it is not the stereotyped minister  --  prim , pious and plalitudinous- - who will lead Americans back to religion as a way of life . uf I he nearly 200 Indlion people in America , wady 109 million call themselves Christians , but in terms of active Christian dedication these figures are nearly meaningless . In the words of Flow Kirkpatrick , the nation and " the world is already far along the road to unbelief " ; it will take men of God who see a vision beyond buildings and numbers to bring them back . Thoughtful ministers recognize that most men possess a lukewarm or nonexistent faith , and they agree that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fervor . " We may yearn nostalgically for what we have lost , " says the Rev. Robert A. Raines , earnest young minister of the First Methodist Church of Germantown , Philadelphia , " but when we are honest with ourselves we realize we ca n't live in the faith of our fathers and its forms and language , and we can not transmit their faith , valid as it was to them , to our children . What we can and must do , or we shall lose the reality and the power and conviction of our faith . is to wrestle with the Gospel at first hand to discover what is changeless in it and what is validly subject to change . " This today is the minister 's most formidable task  --  to make the Scriptures meaningful to individual men and women whose inner resources have been drained away by the emptiness and shallowness of their daily lives . Aware of their own separation from God , unable to find strength in prayer or churchgoing , they turn in desperation to their pastor for counsel . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Atlanta . " They come bringing the shattered fragments of their lives in their hands , saying in effect , ' Please , Daddy , fix this for me . ' And the agony and the glory of the ministry is that you try . You know you ca n't fix it . You can only give them a shoulder to cry on . But to God all things are possible , and as a minister you hope that through you His healing love can be transmitted into the dark places of this person 's soul . " To the Reverend Mr. Saussy and to all other ministers , their efforts to help poor , troubled . frightened mortals find the courage to face the buffeting of a callous and impersonal world bring to them a profound sense of fulfillment  --  and their bitterest sense of failure . But whether he succeeds or fails , the minister 's experiences as pastoral counselor broaden his understanding , deepen his compassion , make him a better minister . " We are given an entree into human lives , " says Father Charles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We see people with their guard down , with all their fears and angers , their inner wounds revealed . And sometimes we can help , and then we know that the Christian faith can work miracles in the lives of men . " The pastor , of course , can get so wrapped up in his counseling duties that his attitude toward his congregation becomes waiped . When he stands in the pulpit on Sunday morning , he does not see in the pews an assembly of believers come to worship God , but a congress of tortured souls possessed by devils which he feels powerless to exorcise . Says Pastor Noah Imbody , of Immanuel Lutheran Church in Evanston . Ill. , " 1 f I 'd known as a young man the problems I 'd become a part of , the human anguish I 'd be invited to see . I do n't think I 'd have had the courage to become a pastor . " Often the pastoral counselor has n't the depth of psychiatric knowledge to perceive what vultures of despair are tearing at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In Aurora , Ill. , the Rev. Birger Dahl of Wesley Methodist Church recalled with sorrow the quiet man who came to him and said . without dramatics , that he was feeling a little al loose ends and would like some employment around the church that would give him a sense of accomplishment  --  perhaps in youth work , for he liked young people . The Reverend Mr. Dahl said he had no opening at the moment . The man got up , thanked him pleasantly , and went home and hanged himself . Over coffee in the basement of his little church in Stamford . Conn. , Father Pedersen , a stocky , powerfully built man of 32 , who celebrates at his altar with unexpected grace and preaches with the arm-waving zest of a barroom raconteur , spoke of his pastoral counseling ag one of the most deeply meaningful aspects of his ministry . Born in Nebraska , the son of a truck driver , educated at the University of Nebraska where he majored in psychology , " led into the ministry by a fine parish priest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New Haven , Corm. , he first served as vicar of three little mission churches in rural Nebraska . There his pastoral duties were traditional . He bore the sacraments to the sturdy farmers of his flock , but they did not come to him for psychotherapy . Their lives were tuned to the great slow rhythms of the earth , to seedtime and harvest , and if they suffered traumas , they did n't share them with Father Pete . M oving on to Pawling , N.Y. , he found him- self suddenly immersed in the problems that demand the greater part of every pastoral counselor 's attention  --  alcoholism . family squabbles , pregnancy out of wedlock , the despair that comes to those who do n't know where they 'll get the money to pay the landlord or the doctor . When he moved to suburban Stamford with its well-to-do commuter population , the counseling grew more complex . Here the age-old problems of alcoholism , infidelity and incompatibility were compounded by the special beles noires that hag-ride the seemingly smug , complacent suburbanite . These families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clubs , their kids in good schools , were financially overextended . These tense , ambitious , hard-driving and hard-driven men had come east from all over the country to battle for their place in the higher echelons of business , finance and communications  --  and the jobs on which all-their success symbols depended were pitifully insecure . " Most corporations , " says Father Pete , " have a way of grinding men to bits . A $15,000-a-year junior executive who suspects his department is going to be reorganized or abolished is even more tremblingly apprehensive than the man in the factory who knows he someday may lose his job to a machine . Many a man gets off the train on Friday night not knowing whether there 'll be a desk for him when he goes into New York on Monday morning . " It 's not easy to counsel with men under such a strain . The terrific tension shows in their faces and in all their actions . It has suddenly dawned on them that they are caught in a great , remorseless machine . Deep inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am I ? Why am I here ? How has life tncked me ? Why has the happiness I sought eluded me ? ' And they come to the minister with these , and similar questions . " What can a pastor say that will comfort them ? How can he restore to them the confidence that God loves them and has not forgotten them ? How can he help them find their identity again  --  their serenity of spirit , the " freedom from fear of a child in his Father 's house " ? Occasionally , Father Pedersen has found , all that is necessary is to be a sympathetic listener who now and then murmurs a noncommittal " um-linimm . " In talking out his fears and frustrations , the man himself begins to put his life in perspective . finds his own answeis , and goes out , strengthened , to resume the battle . Often . though , the inner deterioration has gone too far for Father Pete to be of help . There are dark forces working within the troubled psyche which the pastor can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gently as Possible . to a secular practitioner . " You do n't tell him he ought to see a psychiatnst . That 's like telling a guy he 's failed his Wassermann. " he says . " You just say . ' I know a man I believe can help you . ' But you do n't fool around with the really sick ones any more than you would dabble in brain surgery . " Like many other ministers . Father Pedersen has found that troubled teen-agers respond best to pastoral counseling . " Kids can get awfully upset over sexual misbehavior , " he says . " They get carried away and do something they know they should n't , and they really suffer the tortures of the damned . The thing to do is try to convince them , and their parents . that their lives are not ruined . They are not damned . God does love them and will forgive them , and despite all that 's hap-pened , they can go on and live good , clean . Christian lives . This sounds awfully permissive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minister to stand on God 's side as well as man 's side . When you counsel , you act for God . You can speak of His love and forgiveness , but you must also say , ' It 's wrong to do these things and as long as you do them , you are separating yourself from God . ' " When a pregnancy is involved . Father Pedersen. like the Rev. Carl Weber , pastor of St. John 's Lutheran Church in Mayfair , Philadelphia , strongly counsels against a loveless marriage , " just to give the baby a name , " for this would merely pile one mistake upon another . Instead . the Reverend Mr. Weber urges that the girl accept the care of a church home until the child is born , and that she then turn the baby over to a church agency for adoption . Especially difficult people to counsel are women unhappy in their marriages . Herein lies a danger to the counselor. for the increasing burden of counseling opens doors of temptation to the pastor which may test him beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sensitivity and spirituality in men  --  and the pastor may seem to glow with these qualities . If , vexed by his own personal cares , the minister agrees that they can corn-fort each other , the result is tragedy . With his guilt ill ion hint , he stands mute in the pulpit , knowing himself to he a hypocrite , and the shattering fear of scandal poisons his whole ministry . Today it is recognised that the minister- - and the minister 's wife --  sometimes need pastoral counseling as much as any troubled layman . His profession does not shield him from the problems that bedevil other men . Not only does he get emotionally involved , he also may be over his head in debt , troubled by the rebellion of a wildly delinquent son , married to a shrewish wile , and so desperately overworked that he may be assailed by doubts as to his usefulness as a minister . He may even doubt the validity of the Gospels themselves . " Any minister , " one says , " may give you a thousand reasons for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the past there was nowhere he could turn for help . He could not afford to spend $25 for an hour with a psychiatrist . He could not go to a superior in his church or confide in a member of his flock . He had to bear his burdens alone until he cracked . Recognizing the helplessness of the minister who found himself in trouble , the Rev. Richard C. Raines , Methodist Bishop of Indiana , in 1957 set up a counseling service for pastors . The man he chose as his counselor was the Rev. Dr. James Edward Doty , warm , outgoing , sympathetic , trained in psychiatry , and dedicated to the idea that a minister is as worthy of help as any other man . He opened his office in Indianapolis and passed the word throughout Indiana that pastors could come to him with their personal problems without fear that their secrets would ever be revealed . He then opened the doors for business and had to jump back to avoid being trampled . " Every problem that afflicts human beings except acute alcoholism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . " This does not mean that the Methodist ministers of Indiana are more troubled than other pastors . It merely indicates that in every denomination there are men in need of help . " Doctor Doty finds that many of the minister 's problems stem solely from spreading himself too thin . Harassed by a hundred duties that haw , . little or nothing to do with the thing he really wants to do , which is to preach so powerfully that men will stand in the rain to hear him , he begins to doubt his own calling , to lose his sense of usefulness , to feel a burden of guilt he can not throw off . Like other men , the minister who feels inadequate is prone to vent his frustrations on his family . " A wife sits there in the pew , " says Doctor Doty. " and hears her husband preach with wonderful eloquence and power on I Corinthians 13 ? ' faith , hope and love ... but the greatest of these is love . ' And she sits there gritting her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . for she has n't had a word or gesture or touch of love in months from this harassed and harried man . " Doctor Doty admits , wryly , that he too has on occasion been too much engrossed in his job . One Sunday afternoon when he was a parish minister he was sitting in his study riffling through the pew cards on which his parishioners express their desire for some special attention . " Mrs. James E. Doty desires pastoral call , " he read . " I went home at once , " said Doctor Doty . Not only preoccupation with church business but too much piety can set a minister 's wife to seething inwardly , Doctor Doty says . " If you ever get to where even your wife feels you wear a clerical collar on your pajamas , and she begins to think of you as ' Reverend ' ? watch out . The foundations of your marriage are beginning to crumble . " Jane Yarnell . wife of the Rev. Sam Yarnell , handles this situation in her own way .

One young pastor , mu% happily serving as second man in a big church in a midwestern town , describes his first pastorate in a rural village in the Midwest . " We were there two and a half years .

" I noticed it even at the Laundromat , " she said . " I 'd take my wash down . and there 'd he a woman there I did n't know , and while the clothes were washing . we 'd fall into the friendliest , most natural of conversations . We 'd be having a real good time , free and open with each other , when it would come out that I was a preacher 's wife . Suddenly the mood was shattered . She would n't talk with freedom anymore .

" There were a lot of bridge groups in the town made up of young mothers her own age , she remembers , but she was never asked to join . This did not perturb her greatly , for she had her children and her church work to fill her days . But she was troubled by the fact that she and her husband were shut out from the normal activities of the community . It meant that they , as the pastor and the pastor 's wife , were set apart in an unnatural way from the life of the community .

" In the bigger parish the once-troubled wife is now content . " Here I can he myself , " she says . " and my home can be my own . I 'm sure that I now can serve my husband and my church with a fuller heart . " Many a minister could serve with a fuller heart if he did not feel that both his ruling laymen and his denominational hierarchy sometimes measured his ministry by a false yardstick . His superiors may judge him by the number of pastoral calls he makes  --  though he is lucky to get around to only the shut-ins and the sick . " We just do n't have the time today , " one minister says , " for the tea-sipping social call anymore , the light chitchat ? ' And how is the dog today ? I do hope his mange is better .

There is always upon him , too , the necessity for keeping his church 's membership rolls growing , for in a world whose standard is " how many " rather than " how good , " a minister 's success is measured not by his spiritual qualities but by the rapidity with which his congregation expands . In the old days social pressures kept the pews full , but churchgoing is no longer automatic . If the power of the minister 's preaching or the winsomeness of his personality does not bring the unchurched into the fold , he must stalk them in other ways .

Contacts made at cocktail parties open doors into the lives of people that otherwise might be closed to him . he believes . " 1 feel that I must be a part of my community 's social life as well as its spiritual life . " says Mr. Speers . " Cocktail-party chatter can be inane and boring , but every once in a while a man or a woman will drift over to you after a couple of Martinis and make some small comment that reveals a hidden hunger . a tension , a problem that is beginning to fester which they think the church might help .

If the pews till Op With 4 rid folks 4 t1 Sunday morning , perhaps a " ? ' 0011e marrieds " club would help . Thus much of the busy-work rot the church which burns up the minister 's time is merely the result of his effort to recruit . For he needs not only souls . but bodies who will drop an envelope in the collection plate every Sunday morning . As members increase , the need for physical plant increases , and to build new facilities requires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bigger staff of helpers . Thus the minister is caught up in a spiral of body-snatching and fundraising , which are administrative functions , when all his instincts tell him that he should be spending far more time preparing his sermons and in pastoral counseling . The Protestant ministry , of course , is made up of all sorts and conditions of men . and some of them learn to like and deftly handle their administrative duties , including fund-raising . " You 've got to stay on your toes business-wise , " says the Reverend Mr. Hinson . ' ' You 've got to be a good steward of the Lord 's money . There 's something spiritual about meeting with the finance committee and saying . ' We 've got to spend this money for the glory of the Lord . ' A minister must n't get so heavenly-minded he 's no earthly good .

Some attempt to do this by example , and sometimes the example is dramatic , as last month when the Rev. James J. Reeb of Boston was murdered by rabid segregationists in Selma , Ala . Reeb and the many others like him have striven to prove to their congregations that Biblical religion , though it may be couched in archaic language , is as relevant to the space age as it was to the age of the Roman chariot , and that it is every Christian 's task . not just the ministers ' alone , to carry this message out of the sanctuary into the marketplace . There are older men and timid young men who do not wish to accept this challenge , who dream wistfully of the day when a preacher was expected to make no political and sociological pronouncements  --  when all he had to do to acquire the reputation for outspokenness was to inveigh against drinking , gambling and coveting thy neighbor 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these fleshy peccadilloes in his counseling . tends to ignore them in the pulpit .

W orld War II , in the opinion of the Rev. Paul David Sholin , marked this watershed in the ministry . The men who came out of the cataclysm of war may have seen no visions . heard no voice speaking out of a cloud calling them into the ministry . But as they changed their battle dress for the clergyman 's neat . dark suit , they did so with the conviction that if the world was to survive , the church in the future had to play a more important role in the lives of men . It could no longer hide behind its stained-glasswindows and ivied walls . It had to move out into the dirty , cruel , complex and unbelieving world and there lay down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not of withdrawal but of involvement . " says Mr. Sholin . " It requires guts not only of the man in the pulpit but the man in the pew . ' And he which bath no stomach to this light . let him depart , ? he quoted softly from Henry V 's speech to his barons . " That is my feeling . That is why my people look upon me as a burr under their saddles . " There is a new " worldlier than thou " attitude developing among the younger ministers . They believe with Dietrich Bonhoeffer that the church . to save itself , may have to break its institutional shackles , may have to rid itself of church buildings and church property and of the ministry as a separate class . " To them . " says Dr. Richard Gilbert , director of radio and television for the United Presbyterian Church . " picket lines , freedom rides and demonstrations against every form of political or social injustice must he the deep concern of ministers and laymen alike . " All ministers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the simplicity of the New Testament church , when every believer was a working Christian who laid his life on the line  --  a man seeking not to be ministered unto but to minister , the spirit of sacrifice which sent the Reverend Mr. Reeb to his death in Alabama . Few agree , though . that now is the time to jettison the organized church or to take it underground as a little band of active rebels striking against the evils of society from grimy storefront rneetinghouses in the slums . One powerful parishioner of a big , wealthy . " institutional " church , by working quietly through the local power structure . can do more to stir the conscience of a city than a hundred dedicated doorbell ringers seeking to evangelize reluctant strangers . The church must send its people into the world to tutor dropouts , to work with delinquents and with prisoners , to soothe the troubled inmates of the mental hospitals  --  and from coast to coast the churches are doing these things . But the churchitself must remain as the command post from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return to find renewal . " The church as an institution isolated from the world is sick . and it must change , " says the Rev. Louis Evans Jr .. minister of a La Jolla , Calif .. Presbyterian church . " But only within the framework of the organized church can the Gospel be meaningfully applied to the problems of modern man . When this happens , there will be tension , there will he controversy . But a demanding Gospel , preached in love , will survive . " " The church as an institution will live , " says William Hinson . " but it can no longer exist merely as a sort of spiritual outpatient clinic where men go on Sunday morning to get a holy dose of religious sedative . It must be a drill hall and a barracks , sending its soldiers out into the world as Christian businessmen , Christian doctors , lawyers , ad men , journalists , salesmen . It 's not the minister 's task to bear alone the burden of Christian witness for his people . He 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry the ball . " Unfortunately . the minister does not always know what signals to call . " I am a minister . " says the Rev. Frank Ross of All Saints Episcopal in Atlanta . " I know what Jesus taught as he walked the hills of Palestine . But how do I relate those teachings specifically to the working lives of my people ? I do n't know what goes on in a lawyer 's office . I do n't know what guff a salesman has to put up with that tests his Christian forbearance . " One damper on the minister 's zeal is the fact that few of his laymen seem eager to take the Christian ethic to Main Street . particularly if by so doing they might endanger or even disturb their own comfortable situation . The man in the pew will listen attentively and nod in solemn agreement when the preacher utters platitudes . " But when we get down to the nitty-gritty , " says David Jones . a young Congregationalist minister in Granville , Ill .. " when we start chopping at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A minister knows when this me. r of withdrawal occurs . ' ' says the Rev. Al Williams 01 Trinity Presbyterian in Atlanta . " Their minds snap shin . t heir eyes glaze , and they begin to look out the window . " The surcharged key words which cause the minds In ) close vary front region to region . In Alabama . when Clayton MI : mnions the inniwent word " brotherhood , " he can feel his congregation stiffen , for in Dothan " brotherhood " connotes mixed schools , and Negro voting , and Dr. Martin Luther King causing all that uproar in Selma . In the North , in churches where Doctor King might be welcome in the pulpit , the words ' ' fair fair housing " set off the fear reaction for there are good churchgoing citizens outside the South who fear the Negro as a neighbor as much as Dothan , Ala. , fears him as a voter . a student , and a fellow-worker . In areas where the John Birch Society is strong , the scare words are " mental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the National Council of Churches . " Wherever he preaches , north , south , east or west , the minister treads on shaky ground . He is divided from his people , a division based not on i I ? ' .. logical and political lints , and on 11- ale how far he can push his parishioni itoi it offending them so grievously lhat they ihrow him out . " In college I was as strongly segregationist as anyone , " says Clayton Bill . " But as I grew in spiritual maturity , my thinking changed . If I changed , so can my polite . 13u t 1 prefer to bring about that change by talking to them quietly , face to face , rather than by lecturing them from the pulpit . In this time and place I think that 's the best way . But I 'll he honest with you . I sometimes wonder if that 's wisdom  --  or cowardice . " The minister who lays God 's word athwart the prejudices of his people soon finds out about it in both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drops , and the more angry quit to find another church . " Any minister who has the courage to ask his people to change their deeply conditioned emotions has a battle on his hands , " says Louis Evans Jr . of La Jolla . " That 's what makes this such an exciting time . " Up to three or four years ago there was not too much excitement in Mr. Evans 's ministry . In the sophist icated Los Angeles suburb of Bel Air he preached a straight evangelistic Gospel  --  man 's re ? lationship to God . He did n't bother much about social issues , and he and his pretty blue-eyed wife , Colleen , a former 20th Century-Fox starlet , were " praised , loved and feted . " Then , plagued by his conscience , he began to shift the emphasis in his preaching . He began to talk about man 's relationship to man  --  and the climate suddenly changed . He began to get the message ? " Just preach the Gospel , brother . " / knew this meant I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get right with God . ' " says Mr. Evans , " What was Ito do ? Was I to bend , or was Ito preach what I knew to be the truth ? I went back and examined all my beliefs , the very foundations of my ministry . I searched the Scriptures , the Old Testament and the New . ' Christ , ' I asked , ' what did you teach when you walked the earth as a man ? What were your deep concerns ? And what should be my concerns ? ' And there was just one answer : ' Thou shalt love thy God with all thy heart , with all thy mind , with all thy soul , and thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself . ' " To me that did n't mean loving only the man next door . It meant every man , black or white or brown . And I saw I could n't separate the God-man relationship from the man-man relationship . They were part of the same truth , the same faith . " So now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I know is true , that when Jesus Christ makes a new creature out of a man , he changes that man 's relationship . not only with God but with all other men . So where there was prejudice , there now is acceptance . But it has not been easy acceptance . I lost some people . " Sophisticated young seminarians who now avoid the parish ministry because they believe the parish church has no contact with the grim realities of the world might change their minds if they could read the mail and monitor the telephone calls coming in to the quiet study of the Rev. Donald Gard in Anaheim , Calif . Bald , horn-rimmed , intellectual , a Presbyterian language scholar who left a teaching post at Princeton to return to the parish ministry because be was " more interested in people , their motivations , fears and yearnings than in the etymology of the Greek letter alpha . " Don Gard has had an embattled ministry . " The men who preceded me here were wonderful , gentle , kindly pastors who did what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to hear . " says Doctor Gard . " Then I came , a hard-headed Dutch-Irishman who felt there was something more to being a Christian than just dressing up and going to church on Sunday to listen to a soothing sermon . " Though Doctor Gard tried not to carry his people too far too fast ? " I am not a bleeding heart , defending some of these nuts who go around screaming that the white people are all against them " ? his forthright sermons on civil rights . particularly fair housing . did lose him some members and brought him a spate of anonymous letters and phone calls calling him , among other unsavory things , " a dirty Communist . " For a while both he and his wife , Ruth . felt like giving up , taking their children away from what Gard describes as " this Fascist atmosphere which exists in much of Southern California . " But he is a tough man , a fourth-generation Californian whose great-grandmother came across the plains from Texas . and he would not run . Today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he is still there , preaching to a responsive congregation . " trying to change their lives , trying to free them from fears and prejudices , trying to instill in them a reverence for people and not for things . " He even finds his congregation growing , : an influx , he believes , of " thoughtful mavericks. $0 For the modern minister I S mg In understand the world 's problems so shat he can grapple wish them , the Scriptures arc nut 1ne only source understanding . - There are of her voices in Other mum to which the church can listen , " says the Rev. William l lohnes , 01 the NorthavenNi Nletlii al ist Church of Dallas , " the voices of the playwrights , the novelists , the painters , the poets and the tnu ? sicians . They may be atheists Or aenostics , but they are raising autl tent ic quest ions , arid at t imesoffering valid answers , to the dilemma of modern man , " Thus many a congregation , large and small , finds itself discussing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paintings of Picasso , the poetry of T. S. Eliot and the strange rhythms of the jazz mass . In Dallas the Reverend Mr , Holmes , who has Rouault 's The Clown hanging over the mantelpiece in his new manse , showed Cal on a Hot Tin Roof to his people and led a two-hour seminar on its meaning . " We are n't interested in slogans , or pat answers . " he says . " We show only films that deal seriously with the agony of human existence . Cat is one of these , for in it are the Christian symbols of guilt . sin , crucifixion and resurrection . " To the Rev , James Armstrong of the Broadway Methodist Church in Indianapolis , it is important that the church learn far more about the contemporary mind . " It is in the realm of human understanding that the church has been thick-skinned and shallow-minded , " he believes . " The church , instead of being a God-awful know-it-all. should be a refuge for the seeking , the questing man . " The seeker , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' certain " man , whose certainties are based on premises the minister believes to be unChristian , who causes the minister his greatest anguish . Mr. Armstrong , for example . finds himself " out of sympathy with the oversimple , blind . pietistic middle-class mentality . " But a minister must be loyal to his congregation  --  the inner-city man to his beatniks , the suburban minister to his harassed commuters . and Mr. Armstrong to his middle class . " We must accept them for what they are , " he says . " and work with what we have to work with . Babbitt is a part of society . He may be Shallow . He may be stubborn in his shallowness . But he must be understood . " Once he understands his people , the minister feels he can love them without judging them and , loving them , hopefully he can lead them in the way he knows they ought to go . It is a slow and agonizing process , fraught with disappointment . " Sometimes . " says Sam Varnell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years in the ministry there are probably only a handful of people whose lives I have deeply touched and changed . But I comfort myself with the thought that it took God a long time to bring man to his present state , and it will take more than one man 's lifetime to bring him to the full flower of his humanity . So I just go on , doing the best I can with the talents God gave me . Let the credit , or the lack of it , fall where it will . I just keep on trying . " The Protestant minister , then , is not merely an administrator , money-raiser , club chairman , welfare worker , and cruise director on a happy ship sailing over tranquil seas to the shores of the Great Beyond . He is first of all a man of God to whom has been given this grace " to preach the unsearchable riches ... to enlighten all men . " He may not in his later years be able to articulate . But only in his lowclt moments does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last long . He is , like Paul . a prisoner of Christ , and he asks no greater freedom . He holds forever before him the vision and the promise that the people in the pews , frail , weak and fright-erred mortals though they may be . have within them the Power to shake and change the world , ?
