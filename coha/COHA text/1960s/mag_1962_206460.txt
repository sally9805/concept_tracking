THE MIND AS NATURE ( 60 pp. ) - Loren Eiseley-Harper &; Row ( $2.75 ) . <P> <P> " There is a legend circulating about a late distinguished scientist who , in his declining years , persisted in wearing enormous padded boots . He had developed a wholly irrational fear of falling through the interstices of that largely empty molecular space which common men in their folly speak of as the world . " To this extent , writes Anthropologist Loren Eiseley , 55 , has the world of science diverged from the world of common sense , with little communication between them . In his own field , Eiseley has labored to rejoin the two worlds by tracing man 's 20th century behavior back to its dark evolutionary beginnings , in language that is not only plainly comprehensible but richly poetic as well . In so doing , he has illuminated both the discoveries of the past and the confusions of the present . " Too often , " says Eiseley , " a barbarous jargon separates the scientist from the rest of the world . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal in their writings ; Eiseley makes science an intensely personal experience . One evening , he recalls in The Firmament of Time , he was accidentally locked in a museum among grotesque skeletons of giant crabs . As the crabs began to glow in the light of sunset , he had an uneasy feeling that they had come back to life and were once again going to take over the world . When a guard showed up , Eiseley gasped in relief : " Davis , you 're a vertebrate . I never appreciated it before , but I do now . I believe I 'm right in congratulating you . Just remember that we 're both vertebrates and we 've got to stick together . Keep an eye on them now-all of them . I 'll spell you in the morning . " <P> Eiseley writes extensively of evolution only to show that it does not completely account for the success of human life . The brain , Eiseley emphasizes , allows man to escape from laws of evolution , since his body no longer has to keep adapting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writes in The Immense Journey , a study of the origin of life , " was something the world had never seen before-a dream animal-living at least partially within a secret universe of its own creation and sharing that secret universe in his head with other similar heads . Man had escaped out of the eternal present of the animal world into a knowledge of past and future . " <P> Double Choice . Unlike the usual " popularizer " of science , Eiseley is himself a scientist who commands the respect of his colleagues . Yet as a boy in Lincoln , Neb. , he seriously considered becoming a poet . He got his love of language from his father , a little-known Shakespearean actor . His passion for science was roused by roaming the plains of western Nebraska , one of the world 's finest Tertiary fossil beds . But anthropology alone seemed too narrow a field to his roaming mind , and he also studied biology and sociology in trying to understand the nature of man . After graduating from the University of Nebraska , Eiseley taught his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years was chairman of the anthropology department at the University of Pennsylvania .
