In Shelley Berman 's closet , a dozen $325 suits hang in a row , the right sleeve of each bent at the elbow , recalling a cocked arm holding a telephone . Short of a medieval armorer , no tailor could keep a jacket from taking on the prime characteristic of its owner , the comedian who has risen to fame by talking to imaginary people on imaginary telephones . <P> Ordering new clothes in $1,000 lots , Berman fights the problem with money . His nightclub dates , his cross-country tours of one-night stands , and his three long-playing , long-talking records , which have sold over $1,000,000 worth of copies , round out an income of $500,000 a year . Currently playing ( at close to $10,000 a week ) the enormous Empire Room at Manhattan 's Waldorf Astoria , where a joke can get lost as easily as a cough in a wind tunnel , he is financially the most successful of the New Comedians . <P> Everymanic-Depressive . Herman 's material is a hill of minutiae . He climbs it slowly each evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pieces , some of which have become so familiar that he jokes about how the lips of his audience move with him as he goes along . He finds comedy in everyday trials-a frustrating conversation with a child who keeps hanging up the phone , a speck of dirt in a glass of milk , TV commercials , a dentist ominously taking X rays . Perhaps best known is his airline routine ( " Coffee , tea or milk ? " chirps the stewardess , although the wing is on fire ) ; because of the recent disasters , the sketch has been retired , but many airlines still use the record during stewardess training . Berman builds his long routines forward and backward from initial jokes , as in his newest piece , which grew around a forlorn conventioner who is afraid that if he loses his name badge , no one will talk to him . <P> Beneath Berman 's gentle , familial humor and his brilliantly controlled voice , there is the constant hint of tension . Like a sort of Everymanic-depressive , Berman offstage-and sometimes even Berman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bravado , from hilarity to gloom . Every line of his rough-weathered face ( " Is n't it awful , " he says , " to be 34 and look 90 ? " ) is on the defensive . He blinks , cracks his knuckles and pulls his hair as he chases worries across his mind : Will the talking records choke off his popularity in clubs ? Should he order his next suit with two jacket buttons or one ? Onstage he tries his best to ignore the occasional hecklers , but they get under his skin like West Indian chiggers . " I know I 'm doing things I should n't , " he says gloomily , " and not doing things I should ; but I do n't know what they are . " <P> Autobiographical Confessions . Even in his past , there is a lot to fret about . He describes his early self as " show-off , " " smart aleck , " " clod " and " wisecracking punk , " worriedly says , " I 'm sure my friends thought I was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
