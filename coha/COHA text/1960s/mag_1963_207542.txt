Black Fox . The rise and fall of Adolf Hitler has been told and retold on documentary film so often that it has become a litany of the age . The pictorial archive from which producers draw-walking corpses at Buchenwald , heiling stormtroopers at Nazi rallies , Hitler jigging while Europe burns-has become predictable if still shocking . But Producer Louis Clyde Stoumen ( The Naked Eye ) , finding new film and skillfully interpolating drawings by Picasso , Grosz , Dor and Wilhelm von Kaulbach , has given the story of those years a new aspect . This Oscar-winning film is not just another post-mortem on Hitler : it is a trenchant commentary on the hows and whys of Naziism . <P> Stoumen picked Marlene Dietrich to narrate the film and the choice is both daring and appropriate . Her taut Teutonic phrasing , with its Dietrichy ws for rs , never lets the listener forget that a German is telling the story of Germany 's shame . " How did it happen in this lovely land ? " she asks . Stoumen shows Hitler in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I. The viewer gets a look at Hitler 's competent paintings and drawings ( all without a single human figure ) . Stoumen 's cleverest stroke is the use of Kaulbach 's illustrations for Goethe 's fable of Reynard the Fox , making a neat allegory between the sly fox , who persuaded the king of the beasts that he could save the animal kingdom from the wicked wolf , and Adolf Hitler , who persuaded the aging Von Hindenburg that he could protect Germany from the threat of Stalin . The parallel perfidy of Reynard and Adolf , once they have seized power , falls almost too trickily into place , but the lesson is memorable . <P> In less than 90 minutes the film poses its universal question : How could a sensible people like the Germans be fooled by a fox ? A quotation from Ecclesiastes is offered as the answer : " Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward , and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth ?
