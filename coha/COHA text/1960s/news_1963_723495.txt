Letters to The Times To Reduce Gold Outflow A Nonconvertible Dollar Proposed for Military Payments Abroad To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The United States deficit in the balance of international payments over the past seven years would cause little apprehension if it had not reduced the Government 's monetary gold reserves from about $22 billion to about $15 billion and thereby threatened the stability of the dollar as the international standard and medium of currency exchange . That drain on our gold reserves can be substantially reduced , if not wholly eliminated , by making payments for our overseas military expenditures in nonconvertible dollars , instead of ordinary dollars which , in the hands of foreign central banks , are convertible to gold on demand , Overseas payments for military procurement during that period have averaged more than $3 billion a year . During the same period we have had a favorable balance of trade , our exports exceeding imports on the average of almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold arain caused by our payments for overseas military procurement , etc. , our gold reserves would have remained relatively intact . In some instances it may not be practical to use nonconvertible dollars in payment for such military expenditures , but in very substantial part it should be possible . Faced with the alternative of nonconvertible dollars or no dollars , such foreign creditors for military procurement will accept nonconvertible dollars if they wish to do business with the United States or can otherwise transact with domestic or other foreign suppliers . Payments Nut Trade It may be said that by using nonconvertible dollars for overseas military payments , the United States is reverting to a Schachtian manipula , tion of international exchange to achieve a favorable balance of trade . But payments for maintenance and supply of United States troops in foreign countries is not trade in any sense of the word . Our troops are there not merely in the interests of the United States but also in the interests and at the wish of the foreign countries where they are stationed , and such countries should not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in convertible dollars for services rendered on their behalf . It is to be noted that , of all the European countries , West Germany has had by far the largest increase in gold reserves during the period in which our own gold reserves have declined , and that the 220,000 U.S. troops stationed in West Germany represent much the largest U.S. military contingent overseas . JEROME WEINSTEIN . New York , Oct. 1 , 1963 . To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TI MME : ' : You have recently carried a rwinber of stories and an editorial on the proposal of Consolidated Edison to build a large nuclear power station in New York City . Because of the irrational fears aroused on this subject and because it will be a matter of continuing interest to residents of this city , I would Iike to provide some perspective . First , I should point out tha t I am not taking a position on the Con Edison proposal . Theirs is a vory complex technical plan now bcin ; . ! ; reviewed by a national comn ! ittee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The United States has had very substantial experience in operating nuclear reactors for nearly 20 years . It is quite clear now that normal operation of a nuclear power plant presents no hazard to the public . In fact , such normal operation will have no more effect on the surrounding public than the radiation that is naturally present in the atmosphere . What should be examined by the public is the possibility of abnormal operation of a nuclear power plant . I will readily admit and will unequivocally state that no one will ever be able to offer an absolute guarantee of the safety of a nuclear power plant . Man , being the imperfect machine that he is , will never be able to be absolutely perfect in anything . There are many instances of man having failed and , as a consequence , having caused substantial loss of life . I need only cite the Texas City disaster of 1947 , which resulted in about 3,000 injuries , 500 deaths and $240,000,000 in damages . keeping open on both Saturday and Sunday is a result of dishonest exploitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact is that Saturday and Sunday opening has been common practice for many years by merchants of all faiths in violation of the city 's old Sunday closing laws , not of the new Fair Sabbath Law . Moreover , I can state , without fear of contradiction , that you will not find truly orthodox Jews among the Saturday and Sunday merchants , since , by definition , such individuals must keep their businesses closed on , Saturday . It is to protect the religious rights of such people that the Fair Sabbath Law was passed , and one may be assured that they will not abuse it . As for the high-handed violation of the general Sunday closing law , any attempt by the Police Department to enforce it will be welcomed by the honest supporters of the Fair Sabbath Law , Rabbi NORMAN M. BERN HARP , Director , Metropolitan Council of Orthodox Synagogues . New York , Oct. 9 , 1963 . Edison Power Propo , . a Normal Operation of Nuclear l'INnt Said to Present No Hazard Bosch an Inept Leader TO TliE EDITOR OF THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written by Ronald Hilton printed Oct. 1 on the subject of the recent military coup in the Dominican Republic , where I have been in business for the past 30 years , since leaving my native England . Because Mr. Hilton is styled as a Latin-American expert , his opinion may carry some weight in the United States and I would like to point out that I find his remarks biased in the extreme . Bosch proved to be an inept leader who antagonized the local industrialists and merchants , scared away prospective foreign investment and acted stubbornly when repeatedly asked to tighten up on the Communists . Many Dominicans were saddened at the necessity of the coup , but they were not sorry to get rid of Bosch . Mr. Hilton failed to state that the assassination of Trujillo was acclaimed by practically the whole population . His comparison of this country with Haiti is absurd , Haiti is a mountainous , barren , over-populated country , one-third the size of the Dominican Republic , which in contrast is an agriculturally undeveloped and underpopulated country 1 and which in 50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Central America . Eitic WIDDOWSON . Santo Domingo , Oct. 4 , 1963 . Observing Fair Sabbath Law To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : While your Oct. 7 news article concerning the Blue Law violations by merchants in New York City may have been factually correct , it created an erroneous impression that caused great dismay in Jewish circles . The text of the article , and particularly the headlines , tended to indicate that the widespread flagrant flouting of the law by businesses No Uuarantee There is no absolute guarantee that a disaster will not befall a subway train beneath the East River in the rush hour . Or that the George Washington Bridge will not collapse in the rush hour . Or that one of our own atomic warheads will not be accidentally dropped on New York .

In fact , no one of the general public has ever been injured from exposure to radiation resulting from an accident in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important that the public understand the atom as well as it can . David E. Lilienthal put it admirably when he was the first chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission . " The way we have learned to live with unfamiliar things before was to learn as much as we could about them ; to keep our shirts on ; not to get overly emotional or hysterical ; not to escape from things by emotional outbursts .

Appreciation To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TINIEs : I wish to express my heartfelt gratitude for the sympathy and condolences conveyed to the grieving people of my country through your editorial of Oct. 11 commenting on the disaster at Vaiont . We are profoundly moved by the numberless manifestations of solidarity we are receiving from all over the United States and acknowledge with warm thanks this new , eloquent proof of friendship by the American people .
