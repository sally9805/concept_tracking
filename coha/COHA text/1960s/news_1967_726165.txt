txt Ramsey Clark , whose nomination as Attorney General was confirmed by the Senate today , plans an intensified antitrust drive and wants to use the 94 United States Attorneys ' offices across the country to combat local and . regional price fixing conspiracies . This use of local Federal attorneys to handle price pxing cases would be a departure from the current practice of concentrating antitrust activity in the Justice Department 's Antitrust Division . Mr. Clark also intends to argue personally against any Congressional moves to reverse the Supreme Court 's recent decisions limiting confessions and police interrogations . These views were given in an interview with Fred P. Graham of The New York Times , recorded last Thursday in Mr. Clark 's office with the understanding that it could be made public if Mr. Clark received the nomination . Following are questions and answers from the inter-view : Q. Mr. Clark , Attorney General Katzenbach in his farewell statement to the press said the primary focus of the Attorney General 's duties had shifted from a primary focus on civil rights to crime . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shifted from time , to time between crime and civil rights during this six years that I 've been in the Department of Justice . I think there may be a little more public concern and interest in crime today , particularly " crime in the streets " as we call it , than there has been in the past . On the other hand , I do not think  --  and I 'm sure Nick Katzenbach does n't either  --  that we have solved our civil rights problems at all . I think  --  I do n't recall the context , but I think he was referring to the shift from legal rights issues in civil rights to economic issues , We are closing the gaps in legal rights . Legislation we have up now will make additional headway in securing legal rights for everybody . Then we would tend to shift even more to the economic problem . Q. In connection with that legislation he also stated that an open housing law would be passed . Do you share that confidence , and , if so , when do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confidence . Such legislation is inevitable : It has to be . I think the American people see that more and more , I think it 's something that will come to pass in the 90th Congress . I 'm an optimist by nature . Q. You seemed to go out of your way to specifically mention crime in the street . Does this suggest a feeling on your part that organized crime is not as big a problem as crime in the streets ? A. I think they are two different phenomena . You remember what Browning said about such comparisons . I really do n't like the phrase " crime in the streets . " We think of it as ordinary local crime , nonconspiratorial : It does n't have an organization involved with it . This is much , much more pervasive . IL affects many more people and it reflects much more clearly the quality of our lives and the character of our people , so I do n't think you could compare the two . If we could wave a magic wand today and rid ourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think for a moment which they would choose to banish . Q. Which would you choose ? A. You choose the ordinary crime . Q. Now what can you , as Attorney General , do about . local crime ? A. Well , recognizing that crime is a national problem but law enforcement is a local responsibility , the Federal Government can do two things : First , it can lend financial support to local enforcement ; second , it can give guidance and incentive to law enforcement in better planning , higher standards for personnel , better training , modernization of techniques and more scientific ' equipment . These are the two things that the proposed Crime Control Act does , or would seek to do . Q. The majority of the members of the President 's National Crime Commission stated that legislation allowing wiretapping and electronic eavesdropping by police officials , under strict safeguards , is necessary in fighting organized crime . What are your feelings on this sub-ject ? A. My feelings are that this is not so . Q. Why ? A. For a number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surveillance will give people greater confidence in themselves and in their law enforcement , and give them a greater sense of security and self-respect . I will concede that wiretapping might be helpful in investigating numbers , the numbers racket , and certain types of gambling and perhaps prostitution . But these are criminal activities that can be easily controlled without wiretaps . If the police get away from it , it will help the police , in many other areas . I do n't believe it 's an efficient technique . Experience is that it takes a lot of manpower for a low return . Charge Against F.B.I . Q. Well , despite the present laws against wiretapping and bugging , there have been charges that the Federal Bureau of Investigation has done both . What , if anything , do you think needs to be done to increase the coordination between the legal arm of the Justice Department and the F.B.I. ? A. There 's a much better degree of coordination than many assume . I think you 'll find that we are prosecuting cases in courts every day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the local agents and the United States Attorney . Here in Washington , I am in daily communications with the bureau , so I do n't really see that there 's an inadequacy of coordination . I think the electronic surveillance problem is ene of these things that developed historically over a period of time and would not be illustrative at all of the general relationship . Q. Do you think there is adequate control over the F.B.I . by the Justice Department ? A. I certainly do , yes . There are no wiretaps by the F.B.I . today that I have not approved . Q. How many nave you approved ? A. Ativery few . They are measured in the dozens . Q. These all involve national security ? A. Every one of them . Every one of them . There is no exception . Proposed Amendment Q. Well , now , going back to the crime commission one more time , Mr. Clark , there was a dissent on the part of a group of members who said they thought the Supreme Court 's decisions on confessions had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they urged a constitutional amendment to tilt it back . What are your feelings on that score ? A. My feelings are that we do not have evidence to support a conclusion one way or the other . We 've had too emotional a reaction to the opinions of the Supreme Court in that area . I am in very frequent communication with law enforcement people from all over the country and , as far as I can tell , their practice and activities have not been adversely affected . Q. Mr. Katzenbach said the other day that confessions rulings , court rulings , have had almost no effect on the crime rate . Do you agree with that statement ? A. On the crime rate ? Yes , certainly . I do n't think court rulings cause crime . Q. Do they affect crime ? A. People do n't commit crime with anything so sophisti : cated as the view that , " Well , I can commit this crime now because I wo n't be interrogated . " If a fellow is that well informed of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be interrogated before Miranda anyway . There 's no way to make a man talk ? no way that Americans will tolerate  --  if he does n't want to talk . Q. There are bills pending before Congress that would reverse the Supreme , - Court 's Miranda decision and go back to the voluntariness test for the admissibility of confessions , and I assume there will be hearings especially on this . How will you testify ? A. It 's a practical matter . Of course , we 'd have to study the particular bill very carefully . At this time , on the basis of the evidence that we now have , r would oppose , as a matter of personal judgment , such an amendment . Q. Why ? A. Because I do n't think it 's necessary , and I doubt that it 's desirable . I 'm an optimist  --  I think that we can improve law enforcement vastly . There are many fine dedicated people in it , but I think it has been a neglected profession . And I think that improvement is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a much greater difference in the quality of law enforcement and in protecting society from criminal elements . I think its capacity to do that is infinitely greater than any rule of law about interrogation . Q. Mr. Clark , a minute ago we were discussing the various divisions of the Justice Department and as you rattled them off you mentioned the Internal Security Division , which was created about 15 years ago to enforce primarily the internal security laws , many of which have been declared unconstitutional in the meantime . Is there any thought about merging that division with some other ? A. That division came out of the Criminal Division , as you know . Its strength in the past has been about twice its present strength , We have some exceptionally good lawyers there , and we need to be sure that they are fully utilized , their skills and their experience . Future of Division Q. What 's the future of that division ? Will it go back into the Criminal Division ? A. I rather think it came out of the Criminal Division as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general welfare as part of the Criminal Division . Reuniting the two divisions might help in utilizing our manpower , in broadening our experience base and in recruitment of lawyers . We might have greater resources to devote to internal security if it were part of the Criminal Division . But I do n't think there is an urgent need , one way or the other . Q. As you know , the Senate subcommittee on antitrust and monopoly has published a series of reports in recent years disclosing increasing concentration in American economic life . Do you think that this calls for better laws or different methods of antitrust enforcement ? A. I think it calls for a number of things . We as a people need to continuously restudy our views as to the nature of the economy that we want and the relationship between size and efficiency . I think we have neglected these . I think we 've had to pioneer under very genera statutes , with rapidly changing conditions , so that we have left to the intellect of a relatively handful of lawyers a tremendous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If we do n't maintain a continuous awareness of this subject , we could pay a terrible price . Q. So you 're worried about antitrust problems ? A. Yes . Q. What are you going to do about them ? A. Well , I believe we can increase the impact of antitrust enforcement in a number of ways . One , we can utilize the United States Attorneys ' offices and increase our potential - numerically , particularly in such matters as price fixing . I think the United States Attorneys are every bit as well equipped to handle price fixing matters as regional offices of the Antitrust Division . You 've got a simple fact issue there : It 's just like any other case . Did people get together and conspire to fix prices ? You do n't have any complicated economic theories or any far out legal theories of antitrust laws . It 's a simple fact issue . Q. So you 're going to encourage the various United States Attorneys to get into that ? A. I think we can make a substantial difference there . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then we can better learn where we should go and need to go in the conglomerate merger field , which is an area that we must be very concerned about . Changes in Statutes Q. Do you think any changes are needed in antitrust statutes ? A. We keep as close a review of the techniques as we can , and we really do n't see tools that are offered by way of new statutes that have high promise . We have n't given up in that area . We 're looking . Q. Finally , Mr. Clark , what do you see is your greatest challenge in your job ? What worries you most ? What 's the biggest part of your job ? A. Well , I think the challenge is difficult to define but it 's as much this as anything else : It 's in preserving our traditions -- of a Government of laws and not of men , separation of powers , local responsibilities for law enforcement , our concepts of equal justice under law . It 's in carrying these traditions into the dramatically new environment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , firmness to civil rights . I think that we can see such immense change in the next 20 years that we 've got to have foresight in law and in law enforcement , to bring justice to the poor and to bring justice to the disadvantaged , to secure equal rights for all of our people . So that really the big challenge is to apply our traditions with renewed faith and vigor to immense change .
