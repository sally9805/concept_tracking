U.S. spacemen returning from their high ride splash their frail capsules in the hostile sea . Costly fleets of ships and aircraft are required for their rescue , and many a U.S. spaceman is convinced that the craft would be far better off landing on land . The best space landing spot in the U.S. , says the Bulletin of the Holloman , N. Mex. , section of the American Rocket Society , is right near Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico . <P> The first big U.S. rockets came down on dry land at the Army 's White Sands Proving Ground in New Mexico 's arid Tularosa Basin north of El Paso . But when the Air Force became the principal U.S. rocket-launching agency , it set up shop at Cape Canaveral and flew its long-range missiles over the ocean . The Russians stuck to the land , seem to have found no special difficulty in bringing their spacecraft down on solid ground . Eventually , argues the Holloman Bulletin , the U.S. will have to do the same . Large manned spaceships returning from orbit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unpredictable ocean . If they head for a land spaceport , they can be guided by radar stations from positions that are stationary and precisely located . Their pilots will be able to guide on well-known landmarks . <P> The men who man the Army and Air Force bases of New Mexico believe that the Tularosa Basin is ideal for a major spaceport . In its northern sector is a vast , bare alkali flat with 100 sq . mi. of almost perfectly level surface , made chiefly of gypsum ( natural plaster of Paris ) , which is firm enough to support the world 's heaviest aircraft . Most of the basin 's few inhabitants are already connected with military space activities and are eager to see the region regain the importance that Canaveral took away from it . Even the small cities beyond the basin 's rim are not frightened by the possibility of a misguided spaceship landing in the middle of town . No other spot in the U.S. , says the Bulletin , has the same natural advantages , existing facilities , and willingness to accept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
