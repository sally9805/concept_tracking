ALL right , fellows , I 'm going out there with the troops . What are you going to do to make me feel secure ? " " I hope there wo n't be any war , but let us be prepared . " " Anybody who believes that the United States of America does n't have a bright future should have his brain examined . " " I do n't admit there is a gap . I 'm a little tired of that word . I 've heard enough of it . " " I was born a good child . Had I lost both of my parents at the age of three or four , I still might have become a good man . " " I quit running at 95 . " " It was just as pleasant as a good restaurant . " Who said which ? These quotes , out of this week 's TIME , were said ( but not in the same order ) by Jawaharlal Nehru , Pavel Popovich , Amos Alonzo Stagg , Matthew J. Culligan , Douglas MacArthur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find out is to try to match the quote with the speaker . Another way is to read this week 's TIME . <P> BESIDES four pages in color on the art festival at Spoleto , this issue features four salt-sprayed pages of pictures of the America 's Cup challengers . The reporting assignment fell to Lansing Lamont , 32 , of our Washington bureau ( whose most recent sailing cup dates from the North Haven , Me. , midget dinghy series of 1940 ) . Covering Congress and Cape Canaveral and nuclear testing , Lamont is used to avalanches of garrulity , as well as fits of secrecy . But rarely has he had such trouble getting a story as in the waters off Newport . The cup racers and selection committee members are all business , suspicious of outsiders , wary of the press , and usually " have a quaint idea that sailing is still for the upper classes . " <P> But Lamont , by one device or another , managed to get to his sources . Having coffee with " Glit " Shields of the Columbia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was on his way to a teen-age hop to play at intermission . " I asked him if he needed a piano player , and he said ' Great . ' " Over some Benny Goodman tunes , Lamont wangled a trip on the Columbia . " Glit had me playing the mainsheet like a yoyo , and what I thought would be a free ride ended up a workout . " <P> Hardest to get aboard was Gretel , the Australian challenger , but Sir Frank Packer finally relented . Her Aussie crew told Lamont that he was the first newsman ever allowed to sail on her , and the cruise Lamont took , in pelting rain and a 25-knot wind , had another distinction : it was the roughest weather Gretel had ever sailed in . Lamont had to pay for that passage too : he was ordered to help raise the main by winding in 400 ft. of wire on a portable plywood winch . By week 's end , Lamont was happy to be all quiet on the Potomac.        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
