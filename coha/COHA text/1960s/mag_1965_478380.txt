Except for one peculiarity , the road from Shiraz to Pasargadae is not remarkable . There is n't much to see , as it winds for ninety miles through the barren hills of southern Iran , aside from an occasional camp of one of the nomadic tribes : a couple of dozen black tents huddled beside an almost dry stream bed . Even there , the only people in sight were a few women gathering camel-thorn twigs for firewood , a boy herding goats , an old man loading shapeless bundles on a donkey . I could n't see much of them , either , because the driver always speeded up when we passed such a settlement . At the end of the road we found nobody at all ? only the ruined palaces of Cyrus where he planned , some 2,500 years ago , the wars which resulted in the world 's first great empire . The remnants of his marble throne room , his harem , and his tomb no longer have anything to attract looters or lime-burners , and only rarely a tourist . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spaced about six to ten miles apart . Most were recently built , but their design is an ancient one , complete with stone towers , loopholes , and battlements . And beside many of them stood an armored car , mounting a .50-caliber machine gun , with its full crew standing by in helmets and battle dress . Later I found out why . Although it was never reported in the Iran press , the tribesmen had become irHarper 's Magazine , March 1005 ritated a few months earlier with the Shah 's government and had gone on one of their periodic rampages . Two battalions of the Imperial Army had been badly mauled ? according to clandestine but probably reliable reports ? before the uprising was put down ; and now the gendarmerie , a kind of internal security force , was keeping the area heavily policed . The Abdullah family , as I had better call them , are " modern " Persians . They live in a relatively comfortable Teheran apartment . The father , now retired , was a minor bureaucrat . One son was educated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is n't in jail . Of the women in the household , only the mother still wears the Islamic veil , and even she sometimes lets it fall open enough to display the Western-style dress underneath . They prefer to eat in the traditional way , however ? the men and their guests sitting cross-legged around a white cloth spread on the floor , while the women serve the rice and lamb . Our lunch was almost over when Second Son burst into the room . He was almost exploding with anger , energy , and words , and he somehow managed to pour out a furious stream of rhetoric even while he was stuffing rice and meat into his mouth with both hands. * The gist of his tirade , as I got it *For sanitary reasons , many Iranians do not use knives and forks . As one of them explained it , " I know that my fingers have n't been in anybody else 's mouth , but how can I be sure about your tableware ? " from Elder Son 's translation , was that Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It is you foreigners who are propping up that bloody tyrant , the Shah ! If it were n't for your economic aid , he would fall overnight ! " I pointed out that such aid was tapering off fast , and probably would soon end completely , since Americans were growing increasingly disillusioned with all foreign-aid programs . And then what ? " Why , the regime will be overthrown , of course . And then we shall be free . " But what kind of government would take the Shah 's place ? " You do n't understand , " the boy shouted . " I 've just finished three months in prison for demonstrating against government . Hundreds of my fellow students were killed when the troops broke up our demonstration . We do n't want any government . We just want to be free . " Just north of Ahwaz our driver had to wait at a level railway crossing while a long freight train pulled by . Half a dozen other cars stopped behind us ; then a truck paused briefly at the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the tracks in the other lane . By the time the freight had passed , cars were lined up about ten deep in both lanes ? and the same thing had happened on the other side of the railway . For a few moments the two phalanxes faced each other across the tracks in what seemed to me a permanent , irremediable traffic jam . Then , with 24 THE EDITOR 'S EASY CHAIR much cursing , horn-blowing , and screams from frightened women , the cars began to turn into the ditches and bordering fields in a chaotic double flanking movement . Eventually all of them ( I think ) got back onto the road , and for the time being into their own lanes . Our driver was unconcerned . Iranians , he explained , do not believe in traffic rules , which were not mentioned in the Koran and anyhow were an outrageous restriction on individual liberty . This may be why the road we were traveling ? part of the route built during the war by American troops , to get lend-lease supplies from the Persian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's busiest highways ? is said to have the world 's highest accident rate per mile . These incidents , and many more like them , led me to wonder whether the governing of Iranians might he a more complicated business than I had suspected when I arrived in the country , loaded with simple questions , a few weeks earlier . I was curious about its government because fur a long while I had been hearing the most wildly contradictory reports . On the one hand , the Shah was said to be leading a royal revolution ? a social upheaval managed from the top down , to break the power of the feudal landlords , distribute land to the peasants , and bring prosperity and self-government to a people who had suffered millennial persecution . On the other hand , the Shah was said to be a corrupt , selfish , and brutal dictator who was stifling all hopes for democracy . Both accounts came from people ? Iranians , Americans , and Europeans ? who seemed to me passionately sincere , and who certainly should be knowledgeable about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truth might lie except to look for myself ; and when an unexpected opportunity came along ( thanks to the Carnegie Corporation ) to roam around Iran in a fairly leisurely fashion , I was confident of finding some solid answers . I did n't get them . The only conclusion I was able to reach is that neither version of the Iran story is wholly true . . . that both contain some truth . . . and that probably nobody , including the Shah himself , really knows where the country is heading . At the same time , I am pretty sure that it is heading somewhere , at a speed unequaled in its last two thousand years ; and that the journey is likely to be both exciting and uncomfortable . Moreover , against all reason , I ended up feeling both affectionate and hopeful about the Iranians . They are an exasperating people , full of guile , avarice , and poetry . Their problems look insoluble . But some of them at least do n't know that ? and they are trying to solve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thievery , tribal cunning , charm , and four thumbs on each hand . Just possibly they will succeed . At any rate , watching them try is an exhilarating experience ? very different from the numb depression which soon afflicts an observer in India , only a few hours away . The first thing that strikes a visitor to Iran is the walls . They are everywhere . Each village has a wall around it , ten or twelve feet high , built solidly of brick , stone , or adobe . So does nearly every house in the cities . If a family plans to build a home , it first constructs a wall on all four sides of the lot , containing perhaps ten times as much masonry as the house itself . ( This is so costly that construction of the house sometimes has to be postponed for years ? so Teheran is sprinkled with walled but empty sites . ) The single massive gate opening into the village , or the household compound , is locked , barred , and chained every night . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pervading distrust . No Iranian wholly trusts anybody , outside his own family . He is indelibly suspicious of foreigners , the government , strangers , and his neighbors , in that order . And with reason . I have a hunch that the Persians lost confidence , in themselves and everybody else , in 331 B.C. when Alexander the Great destroyed their empire , and have never since had a chance to regain it . Almost overnight the mightiest realm in the known world , with vast armies , incalculable wealth , a high civilization , and a comparatively efficient administration was overthrown by what seemed to the Persians a handful of barbarians . The catastrophe was incomprehensible ? and it was followed by a relentless succession of similar disasters , as Parthians , Turks , Arabs , Mongols , Tartars , Russians , and Englishmen swept over the stricken land . Naturally the Persians , who catch on fast , soon began to look on every stranger as a potential pillager . To them the government , for centuries at a stretch , was simply the cruel arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , never for them . Its officials came to the villages ( where 75 per cent of the Iranians live even now ) for only three purposes : to collect rent and taxes , to conscript young men for the army , and to seize girls for the local satrap 's harem . Nor are things entirely different today . I visited one village which had recently been " pacified " after a local uprising ( in which this particular village , incidentally , had not taken part ) . A platoon of gendarmes arrived one morning , bayonets fixed , and demanded that the village give up all its rifles . The headman protested , in the name of the Prophet and the martyred Ali , that his people did n't possess a single gun . ( This happened to be true ; that is why they did n't join the uprising . ) " How unfortunate ! " the platoon commander replied . " My job , you see , is to collect rifles . When I return at sundown , you will have at least two ready to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he marched his men back to their trucks , two gendarmes lagged behind for a few private words wirh the headman . Since the village faced such a terrible fate , they whispered , and because they were compassionate by nature , they would be glad to sell their rifles for quite a modest sum . The ensuing haggle took about two hours , while the commander and the rest of the platoon waited down the road just out of sight . In the end , THE EASY CHAIR the compassionate gendarmes had practically every rial the villagers could scrape together , and the headman had , temporarily , the two rifles he needed . Even when it is not coupled with extortion , the disarming of the villages is deeply resented ; for without some kind of weapon , the peasants feel as naked as they would without walls . In Khuzistan province , American agricultural advisers taught the farmers of one village to raise berseem clover on their rice paddies between grain crops . This was a revolutionary improvement which , together with a few other simple innovations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lesson would spread , the Americans were delighted when a delegation from a neighboring village came every few days to inspect the progress of this strange new crop . When the clover finally was harvested and stacked just outside the village wall , the neighbors came again ? this time by night and in full force . They had indeed learned that berseem clover is a glorious gift of Allah . But why go to all the trouble of growing it , when it was so much easier ( and more fun ) to steal it from the demonstration village ? Fortunately the clover raisers had not , at that time , been " pacified . " so they drove off the raiders after a brisk exchange of musketry with the loss of only part of their crop. * Even inside the walls , mutual self-confidence is not exactly rife . Nobody trusts the headman , because he represents the landlord who owns the village . And nobody trusts the family next door , because they are just as hungry and predatory as anybody else . So every night each family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assistance man , who was assigned ten years ago to a village in another part of Iran . He began by telling the assembled peasants that he was there to help them get what they needed most ? an irrigation system , a communal bath house , a school , or whatever . He had not come to impose his ideas ; so would the villagers please consult among themselves and let him know what project they wanted to tackle first ? They withdrew for a brief conference and returned to tell him : " What we need most is rifles . Give us those , and we 'll get everything else on our own . " drives its livestock ? a donkey , two or three goats , a flock of chickens ? into their house . This is a one-room mud but with a single door and a hole in the wall which serves as window and chimney . Since the animals are heavily populated with fleas and lice , and some of the children usually have dysentery , nobody gets much sleep . This may explain why so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a doze in the shade of the village wall . " Such universal mistrust makes it extremely difficult for Iranians to operate any enterprise larger than a family business , and makes government almost impossible . A fairly high official remarked , casually and without indignation , that the people in his bureau spent only about 15 per cent of their time doing their jobs and the rest in trying to get his job , or protecting themselves against the intrigues of their colleagues and subordinates . With this way of doing business , not even the Shah himself can make things happen very fast . Twenty years ago , for example , he decreed that a badly needed grain-storage elevator should be built near Ahwaz . It went up promptly enough ? but it stood empty and unused until 1961 , when somebody finally got around to installing the hoists and motors . A companion handicap is almost universal corruption . The tradition . again , goes back to the earliest invaders . Each new conqueror regarded it as his privilege ? indeed , his duty ? to loot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his governors , generals , and tax collectors to take their share . Until well into this century it was customary for the prime minister to give the Shah on his birthday a present ? such as a dagger with diamond-studded hilt and emerald-encrusted sheath ? which might cost a thousand times the minister 's annual salary . ( You can see some of these gifts among the Crown Jewels in the basement of the National Bank Meli in Teheran , the world 's richest hoard of gems , where pearls , diamonds , and rubies are heaped on platters like so much popcorn . ) So it is not surprising that every bureaucrat ? and every chauffeur , cook , and clerk ? is expected to take his cut out of every transaction . Even if a man is honest ( and I know some Iranians who are ) few of his countrymen will believe it ; and if he could prove it , most of them would think him a fool . Little or no moral stigma is attached to such pilfering and bribery , so long as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with deceit . During centuries of religious persecution ( of the Shi'a sect , to which most Persians belong , by other Islamic factions ) they learned that lying is a sacred duty when necessary to protect oneself , the family , or the Faith . Inevitably this ethos carried over into other areas of life . When caught in some deception , therefore , an Iranian is n't embarrassed ; he is likely to smile and shrug , as if to say , " Weil , it did n't work that time ? hut you ca n't blame a man for trying . " By their own standards , however , - most Iranians are rigidly honorable people . They take enormous pride in their hospitality , their personal dignity , the chastity of their women , their generosity , their knowledge of poetry , * and the respect ( or , better yet , fear ) which they can instill in others ; and they are ready at all times to defend their honor with ferocity , That all this adds up to , it seems to me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iranians into a nation of predatory and rather charming anarchists . After living among them for a few weeks , one begins to understand the despairing judgment attributed to the great Shah Abbas : " Governing Persians not only is impossible , it is ridiculous ! " He found in the sixteenth century , ' Omar Khayyam , the only Persian writer known to most Westerners , is regarded by his own people as a pretty good mathematician and astronomer , but not much of a poet ; the old poets they adore are Firdausi , Hafiz , and Sa'adi . And their modern poets are more influential than any journalist or advertising man in this country . Their verse , of course . is readily understandable , even to non-poets. as have other rulers before and since , that even a minimum of social cohesion can be maintained there only by the sternest authoritarianism . So it is in the family , where Father is expected to be a tyrant who will discipline his grown sons ? and his nieces , cousins , and nephews ? whenever necessary by beatings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Shah is expected above all to be strong ; if not , he has always ( historically speaking ) been soon replaced by invasion or rebellion . The present dynasty , in fact , came to power in just such a situation only forty years ago , when a cavalry officer ? the father of the present Shah ? nudged a weakling off the Peacock Throne . For these reasons , when I went to talk to His Imperial Majesty , Mohammed Reza Shah Pahlavi , near the end of my visit , I already had a certain sympathy for his problems . True enough , he makes no pretense of running a democracy . The parliament , the prime minister , the officers of government , the military , and the police are all quite frankly his tools ; and on occasion he uses them ruthlessly . Yet , in its present stage of development , I do n't see how Iran can be governed in any other way . It must be said , too , that his rule is not altogether oppressive . It might be described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intentions , the wry humor of the Iranian people , and their indomitable instinct for evasion and survival . Thus every few years a tribal uprising or student riot may be harshly repressed ? but in between times both tribesmen and students are relatively untrammeled men . ( Freer , at least , than Iranians have been throughout most of their history. , There is no free press ; but free speech is incessant , noisy , and uninhibited . Any day you may see a policeman clubbing somebody ? usually a petty thief ? into insensibility ; but the police enforce traffic laws ( and most others ) only sporadically . Although they complain a lot , anyone who watches Iranians swarming in their bazaars and mosques finds it hard to believe that they are cowed . Moreover , I came away convinced that the Shah is really trying , with considerable energy and skill , to use such tools as he has in the interests of his people ? particularly the poor . He is attempting two things which are both ambitious and risky : ( 1 ) to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) to wrest ownership of the land away from the handful of absentee landlords who have held it for centuries , and give it to the scrawny villagers who have always farmed it . It is too early to know whether he will succeed . Certainly he faces plenty of trouble , some of it from his own family , still more from the one group ? the foreign-trained intellectuals and managers ? which he needs most . Still , 1 think he is hopeful ( most of the time ) and that his hopes may turn out to be not altogether baseless . In a subsequent report I hope to indicate something about the character of this earnest , uneasy young man ; the kind of trouble ahead of him ; the sometimes disconcerting way he is tackling his job ; and how some of the results look when scrutinized from a village gate rather than the imperial palace .
