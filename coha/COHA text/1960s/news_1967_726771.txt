txt Washington , Dee . 4-President Johnson tonight accused those opposed to the Viet Nam ' war of seeking a " fire escape " i from international responsibilities , just as some Americans looked for an easy way out in the years of Germany 's Hitle and Italy 's Mussolini . The United States is fighting in Viet Nam . he asserted . not merely to save South Viet Nam from communist aggression . but to give all Asia an opportunity for progressive , democratic development and to protect the security of the United States itself . The involvement of the United States in the Viet Nam conflict is " vital to your security , to your family 's security , to the security of your son and daughter , " Johnson told 200 business executives at the state department . Rusk Invites Group The business men were invited to a foreign policy conference for briefings earlier in the day by Secretary of State Dean Rusk and senior assistants . Johnson said tonight the American presence in Viet Nam is in keeping with a foreign policy which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decades , he said , the United States has made it clear it will use its strength to block aggression when its own security is threatened and when , as in the case of South Viet Nam , victims of aggression ask for help and are prepared to fight for their own freedom . Cites Policy Effort Johnson said that " in the echo of gunfire , " it is not always easy to keep in mind that ' the threads of foreign policy extend thruout the fabric of national life . " A lot of people do n't think so , " he asserted , referring to opponents and critics of the Viet Nam war . " A lot of peo- ; ple are looking for the fire escape and the easy way out . " They were doing that in Mussolini 's time , and they were doing that in Hitler 's time . They did not think it was important to their security until it was almost too late . We waited a long time here , but better late than never . " The President said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set in motion in Asia a " domino theory in reverse . " He recalled the " domino theory " that if South Viet Nam should fall , neighboring Asian countries would topple one after the other before communist aggression  --  a threat he declared is no mere matter of theory for Asians , but " a matter of life and death . " Generates New Hope Moreover , and most importtant , he said , Asian nations were " hypnotized " by the menace of communist China . Now , he said , the stubborn commitment of the United States to the freedom of South Viet Nam has made it clear this Asian country is not going to fall to communism and has thus generated in the other nations in that part of the world a new hope and determination to forge their own destinies . Johnson said he was suggesting that " when men weigh the pros and cons of our commitment in Viet Nam , " they consider the fact that the war is being fought not only to keep South Viet Nam out of communist hands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regional life of progress , cooperation , and stability . He said the " protective shield " of the United States has generated progress in Asia just as in the past this shield has enabled threatened nations in other parts of the world " to get on with the real work of peace " of building stable societies and relieving the misery of their peoples . Compares It to Europe Johnson said the new progress in Asia " is as significant for the peace of the world as the rebirth of Europe a fter World War II . " More than half of humanity lives in Asia , he said , and there can be no world peace without a stable Asia . He added that " as this new Asia becomes a firm reality , " there is " a decent hope " the people of Red China also will turn their minds to economic and social development . Citing peace efforts in the middle east and Congo situations and the recent Cyprus crisis , Johnson asserted " this has been a year of remarkable constructive achievement by the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
