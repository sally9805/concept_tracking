THE SHATTERED GLASS ( 337 pp. ) - Jean Ariss-Knopf ( $4.95 ) . <P> Her mood was that of a woman on a window ledge deciding whether or not to jump . She had just lost her only son through a fatal illness ; her marriage was on the rocks , and her husband had gratefully fled to a new job in another state . <P> When she met the new man , he appeared as a rescuer . Slow-spoken , with " a crooked , diffident smile " and an endless supply of incredible stories , he snapped her out of her navel-staring apathy . A brilliant architect , he claimed to be trapped by an indifferent wife , a hostile mother and a satanic father-a millionaire who made his own laws and found pleasure in destroying whatever his son created . Unlikely as these stories seemed , each one that the woman investigated invariably checked out . All of her dammed up passion and maternity were placed at the man 's service . Her resources of love , she thought , were as vast as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man : his need was as deep as the pit of hell , and as terrible . <P> This second novel by Author Jean ( The Quick Years ) Ariss , 47 , a Californian with an artist-husband and five children , is flawed by her refusal to give proper names to her leading characters . As in a morality play , they are labeled the man , the woman , the father . Another seeming handicap is that the man proves to be a confirmed alcoholic who re-enacts the Lost Weekend gamut from DTs to strait jackets to the shameless cadging of money and sympathy . <P> But the novel triumphs because it is a beautifully rendered love story and not a tract on alcoholism . More important than the man 's falls from the wagon are his stubborn returns to sobriety and his fierce determination to be worthy of the woman and himself . He fails ultimately , going down again and again before the woman finally gives up her futile attempts at rescue . But only hope has faded ; love has not . " He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , watching the deterioration of his mind and body . But she adds : " If you have a child whose brain is n't developing properly , you do n't turn against him , or love him less . "
