txt A top Democratic spokesman on fiscal matters predicted today that the Legislature would enact a revenue and spending program without a state sales tax . The spokesman , Senator Samuel L. Greenberg of Brooklyn , chairman of the Senate Finance Committee , also said that the , Senate and Assembly should be able to trim at least $75 million from Governor Rockefeller 's record $3.48 billion budget . Mr. Greenberg indicated in an interview that the Democratic majorities in the two houses ' were considering increases in the pari-mutuel , corporation , liquor and gasoline taxes , as well as higher personal income taxes . The 11-term Brooklyn legislator agreed with some other Fabtara vrachr .. ch Samuel L. Greenberg key Democrats here that the prospects of legislation to legalize off-track betting were slim . He said some members of Ms party and almost , all Republicans would probably vote against it . That view was challenged by a source close to the Senate ' majority leader , Joseph Zaretzki . The source insisted that an off-track betting bill would be passed " because it 's part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it . " Both Mr. Greenberg and Moses M. Weinstein , the newly appointed Assembly majority leader , conceded that the Legislature was likely to approve Mr. Rockefeller 's requests for doubling cigarette taxes and automobile registration fees . Speaking at an afternoon news conference , Mr. Weinstein said : " This may be one of the places where we have to go along with the Governor 's suggestions . " Mr. Greenberg , who was spending his first full day in , his elegant new office , refused to say specifically , that the 2 per cent state aztles. - tax proposed by Mr. Rockefeller would be rejected by the Legislature . However , he made it clear that he fully expected this ? to take place . Budget Cuts Weighed The Governor 's executive budget , submitted . late last month , calls for $530 million in new taxes-5330 from the sales tax , $110 million from the cigarette tax and $90 million from auto registration fees . If the Democrats can trim the Governor 's spending proposals by $75 million , they will need $75 million less in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in other words , only about $455 million . The cigarette and auto-registration levies would account for $200 million , reducing the total to be provided to $255 million , Senator Greenberg said . If the sales tax is not enacted , the Senator explained , the total could be cut still further , Mr. Rockefeller 's budget allocated the stock-transfer tax , expected to yield $60 million in the next fiscal year , to New York City as a partial reimbursement for its loss of part of its own sales tax under the proposed state sales=tax system . The Governor also provided a $10 million appropriation for the administrative costs ofl collecting the sales tax . Those disbursements would not be needed if there were no sales tax . Thus , according to Mr. Greenberg 's calculations , the Legislature would ultimately be confronted with finding only about $185 million . Other Taxes Considered Mr. Greenberg listed the foiling methods of raising the needed money as among those now under consideration : tlAn increase of 1 per , ' cent in the . tax corporation  --  refits , ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in. $50. million more a year , but would cost the corporations only . $25-million because of Federal tax credits on taxes:paid to the state . - 9An increase of 2 cents a gallon in the tax of gasoline , which is now at 6 cents a gallon . That would produce about $80 million in revenues . tlAn unspecified , Increase in the liquor tax . ciAn increase of 5 per cent in the tax on pari-mutuel betting pools at thoroughbred and harness-racing tracks . This tax is now 15 per cent . The increase would produce roughly $60 million a year . Several possible Combinations of those taxes , Mr. Greenberg observed , would produce the required revenues . But , he said , the Democrats might prefer to increase personal income taxes by a small amount instead . Mr. Rockefeller said in his budget message that he had decided not to ask for an increase in .. the income tax because an enormous rise would be needed to match the funds- that could be provided by a sales tax . Wo n't Hurt ' Little Man ' " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regressive tax , " Mr. Greenberg said . " It is possible to raise substantial sums of money without hurting the little man . The sales tax hurts the little man and our job is to protect him . " In preparing their final budgetary proposals , the Democrats will have the help of a special . nine-man staff that will report to Mr. Greenberg , Mr. Zaretzki , Assembly Speaker Anthony J. Travia and Assemblyman John T. Satriale of the Bronx , chairman of the Ways and Means Committee . Howard F. Miller , a Syracuse ' University expert on government finances , has been hired ! as the director of the staff . He has already recruited several aides , including at least two from universities in the state and several- others from the State Bureau . of the Budget . Dr. Miller , an associate pro ' fessor of political science at Syracuse , has been a consultant to the Democrats in the Legislature in recent years . He was a Deputy Director of the Budget during the administration of former Gov . W. Averell Harriman.   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
