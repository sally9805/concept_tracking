What are my marching orders ? " asked District Court Judge James Boyle on the telephone from Edgartown . " Halt , " replied the clerk of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court in Boston . <P> Last week , 17 hours before the inquest In Re : Mary Jo Kopechne was to begin on Martha 's Vineyard , the state 's highest court intervened , delaying the proceeding for at least several weeks and temporarily awarding Edward M. Kennedy a legal victory . Justice Paul Reardon ordered a postponement until the full seven-member supreme court , now in recess , could hear arguments on whether an inquest governed by Judge Boyle 's ground rules would be a violation of Kennedy 's constitutional rights . <P> Thus , for the first time since his black Oldsmobile tumbled off the Dike Bridge on Chappaquiddick seven weeks ago , Kennedy gained a measure of legal control over the case that , in the midst of his own silences and the elaborate speculations of practically everyone else , had been careering toward what he feared would be , in effect , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The postponement , of course , did nothing to halt his unofficial trial by popular opinion . Kennedy foresaw that his petition for delay would prompt talk about a " Kennedy power play " and " wealth and influence thwarting justice . " But his lawyers increasingly feared that the inquest , under Judge Boyle 's terms , could take on some aspects of a kangaroo court . Boyle opened the inquest to 103 reporters and denied that the hearing represented an accusatory proceeding . Hence , ruled Boyle , lawyers for the witnesses-including Kennedy and the others who attended the Chappaquiddick cookout-had no right to cross-examine or challenge testimony on the grounds of irrelevancy . <P> What , then , if John Farrar , the scuba diver who recovered Mary Jo 's body from the bottom of Poucha Pond , were to take the stand to promulgate his theory that the girl probably lived , breathing in an air pocket , for some time after the accident ? Under Boyle 's strictures , Kennedy 's attorneys would not have been permitted to produce expert testimony to challenge Farrar 's thesis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edgartown would recirculate the Farrar version , enveloped this time in the dignifying aura of a legal proceeding . <P> General Inquisition . In the hearing before Justice Reardon in Boston 's Suffolk County Courthouse , Kennedy Attorney Edward Benno Hanify argued : " It is difficult to see in the inquest something other than a general inquisition into his reputation and conduct over and above that to which he has already pleaded guilty leaving the scene of an accident . I submit that the rights of which he has been deprived present grave constitutional questions . "
