Whatever else happens in 1964 in the booming sport of Thoroughbred racing ( see following pages ) , top billing belongs to the act that will be played before a full house and a national television audience at New York 's Aqueduct track this coming Saturday afternoon . And regardless of the result , the focal point for everyone 's attention will be a wonderful little bay , Northern Dancer , as he tries for victory in the 96th running of the mile-and-a-half Belmont Stakes . A victory in the Belmont  --  any year  --  is an achievement of distinction in itself . A victory for Northern Dancer and Jockey Bill Hartack ( see cover ) , following their triumphs in the 90th Kentucky Derby and 88th Preakness , would make Edward P. Taylor 's Canadian-bred colt the ninth Triple Crown winner in history and first since 1948 . The opening odds against such a parlay are immense . // Upward of 300,000 horses have been registered with The Jockey Club since it became possible for any one of them to win the Triple Crown nearly half a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three classic events , but Northern Dancer is only the 14th to approach the challenge of the Belmont having already won the first two legs . Of his 13 predecessors , the eight pictured at right made it  --  so the mathematical odds are 8 to 5 in The Dancer 's favor , perhaps about the same as those that will flash opposite his number on the Aqueduct tote board on Saturday . Of the five who failed , two had excellent excuses : Burgoo King ( 1932 ) and Bold Venture ( 1936 ) did not start in the Belmont . Pensive ( 1944 ) led to the stretch in his Belmont , then lost by half a length to longshot Bounding Home . Tim Tam ( 1958 ) broke down during the race , but hung on to take second behind Cavan . And in 1961 Carry Back , cut in the early running , ran one of his rare dull races to wind up seventh to the outsider , Sherluck. // If Northern Dancer can whip George Pope 's California-bred Hill Rise for the third straight time his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suddenly , The Dancer has acquired an international following similar to Carry Back 's in his heyday . When he reached his true third birthday on May 27 , Northern Dancer received a cake of carrots ornamented with miniature Canadian flags from two of Taylor 's friends , Frank and Betty McMahon . Outside his stall in Barn 31 was pinned a telegram that read , HAPPY BIRTHDAY AND MAY ALL YOUR TURNS LEAD TO SHORT STRETCHES . It was signed by the Princeton University Northern Dancer Syndicate and was just one of 300 cards and wires that arrived in tribute to a runner who has captured the fancy of punters everywhere . // Trainer Horatio Luro was not , however , allowing birthday fame to go to The Dancer 's head  --  or to his stomach . ( He was only allowed to nibble at the carrots . ) " He has put on a little weight , which I like , " said Luro . " He has trained very well and appears stronger every day . " // Following the Preakness , Taylor said of The Dancer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mile and a half . Any speed horse that you can rate has an advantage at this distance provided his jockey is a good judge of pace . We know this horse qualifies and so does Bill Hartack . " Luro does not agree entirely with the boss 's thinking . " Northern Dancer 's best distance may actually be from a mile to a mile and an eighth , " he says , " but his class , in relationship to the class of the competition , will permit him to run the Belmont distance . The long gallops have tuned his heart perfectly . If we do n't make it , it wo n't be because he is not fit . " // Surely Northern Dancer can not be faulted on breeding class any more than he can be on performance . Both are nearly perfect . Although neither his sire , Nearctic , nor his dam , Natalma , achieved fame as U.S. fans recognize it , their ancestry reads , generation after generation , like a Who 's Who of breeding and racing success . In The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Discovery , Blenheim II , Hyperion , Mahmoud , Nearco and Native Dancer . To this add Luro 's patient training methods and Hartack 's skill and familiarity with Northern Dancer , and it is hard to see how he can be beaten by Hill Rise or any other entry . ( Their rivals in the Belmont should include Roman Brother and possibly Determined Man , Quadrangle , Brave Lad and National , although none is considered a serious threat to the top two. ) // " Hill Rise , " says Trainer Bill Finnegan , " should benefit from the longer distance because I do n't think he 'll be so rank or hard to rate or half as nervous as before . I think his nervousness took a good deal out of him even before getting to the post in the Preakness . " Finnegan also feels Hill Rise would run better at Aqueduct if the track were well watered ; he considers it very tiring when fast and dry . But if Finnegan is looking for an edge in track conditions he may have come to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dancer has yet to lose ( Hill Rise has never raced there ) . Northern Dancer 's third start at the Big A should bring his third win  --  and the mightiest win for any horse in this country since Citation led by eight lengths at Belmont Park on June 12 , 1948.
