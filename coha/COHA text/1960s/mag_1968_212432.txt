Ratings-wise , as they say at the networks , the first half of the 1967-68 TV season has been seismographic . In one recent six-week period , the Beverly Hillbillies jounced from the No. 1 position to 27th , Ed Sullivan from 19th to third , Dean Martin from 20th to seventh . Significance-wise , say the programming vice presidents , these sharp fluctuations signal the era of the " selective viewer . " <P> In the past , producers operated on the axiom that if viewers could be hooked in the first three weeks of a new series , they would stick with it all season . So why bother about quality ? Now , says NBC 's Mort Werner , " viewers are less committed . They make their selections on a program-by-program basis , and if a special seems more interesting than a series , well , the dial is just an arm 's length away . " <P> Specials .

" <P> On the plus side of this season , TV finally showed signs of growing up in matters of censorship and salesmanship . The networks now schedule movies that deal with touchy themes-prostitution in Never on Sunday , drug addiction in Man with a Golden Arm . Both films were considered too hot to handle two years ago . Following the lead of Bell Telephone , Xerox and Hallmark , an increasing number of sponsors bunch or juggle the sequence of their commercials to suit the format of a show . And in upcoming months , the programmers are preparing the TV , debuts of such film @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Katharine Hepburn , as well as more specials by such writers as Paddy Chayefsky , Tad Mosel and Gore Vidal , who have returned to TV after a hiatus of several years .
