Chancellor Konrad Adenauer saved his regime from collapse over the Der Spiegel " treason " scandal last week . But nothing der Alte did or said could muffle the growing noise surrounding his government 's role in the affair . <P> <P> Still in jail were Publisher Rudolf Augstein and the top editors of his brash newsmagazine , which had angered the government by its incessant criticism and allegedly had broken the law by its publication of " secret " details of the strength of the West German army ( TIME . Nov. 9 ) . Still scouring Der Spiegel 's Hamburg headquarters for evidence were the squads of police that last month had pounced on the staff in a series of midnight raids . <P> Reversing the Rule . The noisiest , angriest Bundestag session in years greeted Adenauer as he rose to state the government 's case . The opposition shouts of " Gestapo ! " and ' ' Neofascist ! " only made the old man angrier . " Who is this Herr Augstein , anyway ? " cried der Alte . " He makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indecent . " <P> At that , an angry young Bundestag Deputy from Dsseldorf rose to protest . He was Wolfgang Dring , 43 , deputy leader of the Free Democratic Party and a friend of Augstein 's . " Mr. Chancellor , you are the first to arrive at a verdict that only a court has the right to determine . " Then , in a shaking voice , Dring told of his half-Jewish wife , who lost 22 of her 26 living relatives in Nazi concentration camps , and fled to Britain during the war . She did not want to return to Germany , Dring told the Bundestag . " For weeks and months I tried to make it clear to her that all the worries and doubts were unjustified . " Now , he said , his wife 's old fears were returning . <P> What alarmed the government 's critics most was gradually emerging evidence that the crackdown on the magazine had been essentially political . From the start , many thought it strange that Minister of Justice Wolfgang Stammberger was not told in advance by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it turned out , it was not strange at all . <P> Augstein is a vigorous backer of the Free Democratic Party , the small group that shares power in an uneasy coalition with Adenauer 's Christian Democrats . Had Stammberger known in advance of the planned arrests , he might well have blocked the scheme . Afterward . Stammberger became so angry that he threatened to quit and take his four F.D.P . colleagues with him out of the coalition Cabinet . But in the end Adenauer salved his hurt feelings by firing a couple of the second-level ministerial officials involved in the arrests . They were obviously political scapegoats . The compromise hardly satisfied Der Spiegel 's editors , who splashed Augstein 's photograph on the cover of the following week 's issue , ran a 24-page story on the affair .
