In Japan , garagemen charge 22 to repair a punctured tire , while doctors get 15 for a medical checkup . Feeling understandably misused , the Japanese Medical Association last week called its members out on two 24-hour strikes and announced that Japan 's 70,000 doctors would strike-and demonstrate-every Sunday until they get a 30% raise in fees . <P> The striking doctors were careful not to leave Japan completely undoctored . Stand-by staffs were detailed to treat emergency cases in hospitals-but getting to the hospital was a problem . Firemen in Tokyo pressed 114 red fire engines into part-time duty as ambulances , made 523 stretcher calls . Despite all the sirens and confusion , only six deaths were attributed to the doctors ' strike , and in each case the patient was so far gone he would probably have died anyhow . <P> Target of the doctors ' strikes is the health insurance plan , Japan 's form of socialized medicine . Under the plan , an appendectomy brings $8.80 , an abortion ( legal in Japan ) $2.62. an emergency night house call 34 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart surgery . As a result , 60% of Japan 's doctors earn less than $85 a month-even less than the average Japanese schoolteacher . <P> An even more bitter pill for any self-respecting medical man is the government 's control over the treatment of every diagnosable malady . The Ministry of Welfare code prescribes every step . If , for example , a doctor suspects tuberculosis , he may Xray , but can collect his fee ( 88 ) only if the results are positive . <P> Says the Japanese Medical Association 's president , rotund Dr. Taro Takemi , who is leading the doctors ' demonstrations : " It is unfortunate that the situation exists where a doctor must parade in the streets . I agree it is unethical from the broad human viewpoint , but doctors , too , are human beings . "
