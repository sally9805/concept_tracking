The setting is a bare stage , very dimly lit . Upstage center is a sawhorse with a yellow caution light mounted on it . The light blinks on and off throughout the play . On each side of the sawhorse is a YOUNG MAN seated against the upstage wall . THEY both wear black pants , black shirts and vests , and black hats . THEY seem to be sleeping . Offstage is the sound of a single cricket , which lasts throughout the play . As the curtain rises there is a long pause , then a saw is heard offstage , then a hammer , then the saw again .
