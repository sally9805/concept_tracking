Richard Nixon went all out . He built up an organization of 75,000 volunteers , traveled more than 50,000 miles , visited 40 of the state 's 58 counties , wound up with a four-hour telethon on which he answered questions on 146 subjects . Last week Nixon won his party 's nomination for Governor of California . But it was a shadowed victory . <P> Opponent Joseph C. Shell , Los Angeles oilman and leader of the Republican minority in the state legislature , tuned his campaign to the G.O.P. 's right wing . " I 've gotten sick and tired of calling people liberals when they 're basically socialists . ' ' he said . Though not himself a member , Shell welcomed the endorsement of the John Birch Society . Nixon , in contrast , denounced the far-right-wing organization , called upon Republicans to get out of it . After the primary , news commentators called the outcome a " smashing victory on the comeback trail . " But with 65% of the vote to Shell 's 35% , Nixon had plenty to worry about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senator Thomas H. Kuchel , who in his primary contest for renomination got nearly 80% of the vote against two opponents . <P> A Start on the Wooing . On the California registration rolls , Democrats outnumber Republicans by roughly three to two . In order to beat Democratic Governor Pat Brown in November , Nixon will , by his own calculations , have to gather in 20% of the Democratic vote and fully 90% of the Republican vote . <P> On the basis of his primary performance , he is going to have to do some persuasive wooing among hard-Shell G.O.P. conservatives . <P> Nixon got started on the wooing while the votes were still being counted . He congratulated Shell on fighting a " good battle , ' ' said that " those who have supported Joe Shell will see that their differences with me are infinitesimal compared with their differences with Brown . " Next day Nixon held a joint press conference with San Francisco 's beefy , Greek-born Mayor George Christopher , G.O.P. nominee for lieutenant governor . Did the primary results add up to a defeat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Nixon . " I consider myself a conservative -a progressive conservative . " Republicans v. Nixon . Loser Shell predicted that Brown would beat Nixon in November . As to whether he would support Nixon , Shell said Nixon would first have to show dedication to conservative principles , including a " very public commitment " to cut $200 million ( about 7% ) out of the state budget . But no matter what promises Nixon might make , a good many Shell Republicans want to see him lose in November . His defeat , in their view , would show up the futility of his middle-road approach , help clear the way for conservative domination of the G.O.P.
