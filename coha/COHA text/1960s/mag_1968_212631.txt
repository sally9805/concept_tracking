The God of the Hebrew Bible is depicted as the faithful protector of his chosen people . Yet at least 6,000,000 Jews died at the hands of the Nazis . To believe in the God of the Covenant today , concludes Richard L. Rubenstein , Jews must affirm that their creator " used Adolf Hitler as the rod of his wrath to send his people to the death camps . I find myself utterly incapable of believing this . Even the existentialist leap of faith can not resurrect this dead God after Auschwitz . " <P> As it happens , Rubenstein , 44 , is not a disaffected atheist but an ordained rabbi in good standing and a Jewish chaplain at the University of Pittsburgh , where he also teaches humanities . One of the most interesting of American Judaism 's younger theologians , he is at least a spiritual cousin of Christianity 's " death-of-God " thinkers , who are considerably more enthusiastic about his work than are Rubenstein 's fellow Jews . <P> Ocean &; Waves . Rubenstein , who has an M.A. from Jewish Theological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , expressed his disbelief in Judaism 's traditional deity in After Auschwitz , a collection of essays published in 1966 . There he argued that Hitler 's holocaust was deathly proof that the " transcendent , theistic God of Jewish patriarchal monotheism " was no more . Strongly influenced by the late Paul Tillich , Rubenstein nonetheless concludes that there is a " Holy Nothingness " as the source of all being . This Holy Nothingness is totally beyond human comprehension or categorization , and he compares its relationship with man to that of an ocean and its waves : " Each wave has its moments in which it is discernible and distinguishable as a separate entity . Nevertheless , no wave is really separate from the ocean , which is its substantial ground . " <P> Although he has much in common with today 's Christian radicals , Rubenstein is critical of them . He rejects the optimism voiced by William Hamilton and Thomas Altizer , who argue that God 's death makes possible the freedom of man to achieve spiritual maturity . " The death of God as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but this is no reason to dance at the funeral , " for man alone is incapable of eliminating tragedy from life . <P> Rubenstein believes that religion still has a worthwhile social value in an age of atheism . He is convinced that it can help men live with " the cold , indifferent cosmos " by providing a form of fellowship and hope , primarily through spiritually satisfying liturgy and ritual . " The primary role of religion is priestly , " Rubenstein argues . " It offers men a ritual and mythic structure in which the abiding realities of life and death can be shared . "
