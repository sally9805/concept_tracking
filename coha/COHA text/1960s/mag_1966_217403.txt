Unquestioning belief rather than critical self-examination has always been the Mormon style . Breaking with this tradition , a group of young Mormon intellectuals , all of whom went to either Harvard or Stanford , have brought out Dialogue , a learned quarterly dedicated to the proposition that the faith of the Latter-day Saints is compatible with reasoned inquiry . <P> The first unabashedly highbrow publication in Mormon history , Dialogue* gets no financial support from the church , is designed to keep intelligent , educated Mormons who might otherwise fall by the wayside within the community of Saints . Its tone contrasts sharply with that of the vast array of official Mormon publications-ranging from Salt Lake City 's daily Deseret News to the Relief Society Magazine , a women 's monthly-which read like house organs and propagate what one Dialogue editor calls " the myth of the unruffled Mormon , " impervious to doubt . In reality , argues Dialogue 's book-review editor , Richard L. Bushman , a history professor at Brigham Young University , plenty of young Mormons " have become estranged from the church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dialogue has opened its pages to criticism from nonbelievers . In the first issue , Presbyterian Theologian Robert McAfee Brown politely suggested that Mormons seem more interested in conversion than in genuine dialogue with other Christians , while Roman Catholic Mario S. De Pillis argued that Mormon histories of their church have been less than thorough in explaining its origins . In the 145-page second issue , published this month , Political Science Professor Louis Midgley of Brigham Young University presents a surprisingly sympathetic Mormon criticism of the late Paul Tillich 's vision of a nonpersonal God . In another article , Political Scientist J. D. Williams candidly reports that the Mormon hierarchy appeared ready to endorse the John Birch Society earlier this year , but after pressure from one group of church elders , " stepped back from the abyss . " In an implicit criticism of the church 's policy of barring Negroes from its priesthood , Mormon Karl Keller describes the profound spirituality of the American Negro in an essay on a civil rights project in Tennessee . <P> Cautious as such criticism is , it represents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ominously declared : " Dialogue ca n't help but hurt the church . " Nonetheless , Dialogue 's growing subscription list now stands at more than 3,000 , and its editors insist that Mormonism has nothing to fear from self-appraisal . Says Managing Editor Eugene England : " A man need not relinquish his faith to be intellectually respectable , nor his intellect to be faithful . " <P> <P> *Not to be confused with Dialog , a theological journal of the American Lutheran Church .
