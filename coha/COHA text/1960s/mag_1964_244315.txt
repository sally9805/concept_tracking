The ultimate cynic is someone who wants to know who was singing backstage while Caruso was mouthing the words . Of course , the ultimate cynic lives in Hollywood . Anywhere else , the star of a musical might reasonably be expected to be a singer . But not out there . When Audrey Hepburn sings I Could Have Danced All Night in Warner Brothers ' My Fair Lady , the voice on the sound track wo n't be Audrey 's . It belongs to Marni Nixon , the ghostess with the mostest . A girl with a rubber range , Marni is a redheaded , blue-eyed lyric soprano who can slip into a contralto and sing in the accents of any unmusical star . She was also the voice of Natalie Wood in West Side Story , of Deborah Kerr in The King and I , of Janet Leigh in Pepe . <P> Marni gets no credit for this ; her Lady contract even forbids her to talk about her work . She did , however , go to bat for a slice of the royalties on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But , she says , " it gets harder and harder to adapt yourself to the person you 're dubbing . Eventually you want to play the character yourself . " Last week Marni Nixon was actually mouthing the words as well as singing them . Appearing with the Seattle Symphony in Schoenberg 's Pierrot Lunaire and the Poulenc-Cocteau short opera , The Human Voice , she proved herself a creditable actress , won critics ' praise for " superb musicianship , " a performance full of " ease and assurance . " <P> She has sung three times with the New York Philharmonic and has cut albums of everything from works of Bach and Villa-Lobos to South Pacific and The Mother Magoo Suite . She has lived most of her life in the Hollywood area and has been a singer since she was ten , when , as Margaret Nixon Mc-Eathron , she won a contest with a smooth Blue Danube at the Pomona State Fair . At 17 , she quit high school to work as a messenger at MGM , soon got her first $35 dubbing job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Voice , as her husband calls her , is 32 now , makes about $10,000 for a major film dub . Her husband , Ernest Gold , writes movie scores ( TIME , Jan. 17 ) , notably for Exodus and Judgment at Nuremberg . <P> " When I 'm singing opera , I 'm a very good opera singer , " says Marni Nixon in a self-appraisal that contains more professional confidence than mere egotism . " When I 'm doing concerts , I have a lot of musicianship . And when I 'm doing musical comedy , I have a certain flair there , too . I would love to do a Broadway show . I 've been up for several , and it 's getting quite close . "
