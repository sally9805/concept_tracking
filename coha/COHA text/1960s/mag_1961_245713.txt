Prime among the Soviets ' goals is to disarm the U.S. , if possible , by talk . In this they have had some success . For 27 months , while the Soviets dragged out the nuclear test-ban talks at Geneva , the U.S. has refrained from nuclear testing without any guarantee that the U.S.S.R. was doing the same . Last week the Atomic Energy Commission warned that a continued unpoliced moratorium presents " risks to free world supremacy in nuclear weapons . ' ' <P> The report , signed by outgoing AEC Chief John McCone and the three commissioners who will remain under the new Administration , argued that further testing by either side would achieve " major advances in weapons design . ' ' Behind their wall of secrecy the Soviets could test clandestinely either underground or in outer space . " The military advantages to be gained from clandestine nuclear testing are great . " said the report . " The probabilities of detecting and identifying clandes tine tests are very small . " The Neutron Bomb . Pentagon worriers go a step farther than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remain stagnant in nuclear development even if the Soviets do , for clear-cut U.S. nuclear superiority is the best deterrent to attack . A few further nuclear tests , they say , would boost threefold the blast power of the two key U.S. deterrent missiles - the mobile , solid-fueled Polaris and Minuteman - which now carry warheads of one-half megaton , v. an estimated eight megatons for Soviet ICBMs . Testing would also speed development of a next-generation " neutron bomb . " Now on the drawing boards , that weapon is designed to bom bard a specific area with showers of le thal , invisible neutron " bullets . " Because its fusion reaction is to be triggered by conventional explosives instead of " dirty " fission , there is much less blast or radioactive contamination-so that the bombarded area is left intact and friendly troops could occupy it . Furthermore , neutron weapons would be much lighter and cheaper than existing nuclear weapons , thus have enormous implications for brush-fire-war tactics . <P> The first power to possess the neutron bomb will gain great military superiority and flexibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experimenting toward such a bomb since 1952 , though there is no evidence that they have tested it . But tests are easy to conceal in the absence of great blast or fallout . The U.S. <P> is stalled in the blueprint stage while the test ban continues . It is prepared to make important data-collecting tests within 60 days after the ban ends , but prototype tests would be many months away . <P> The Prime Risk . Balanced against the military scientific risks of maintaining the ban are the political-diplomatic risks of rescinding it . The Soviets have mobilized much of the world 's opinion for a ban by 1 ) propagandizing the terrors of nuclear fallout , 2 ) giving the illusion that an agreement was always just around the corner at Geneva . President Eisenhower was persuaded by his diplomats that a resumption of testing would be harmful to the U.S. in the United Nations , persuaded by his scientific advisers that the risk of Russian cheating was outweighed by the chance that Geneva might produce a breakthrough on the inspection issue that would lead to general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
