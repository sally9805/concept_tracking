Just back from a vacation , Chicago 's U.S. District Judge Joseph Sam Perry dealt quickly with a couple of routine items on his docket one morning last week . Then he turned to major business : Case No. 63-C-1426 , that of Lloyd Eldon Miller Jr . Last month the Supreme Court reversed the 1956 conviction of Cab Driver Miller for the rape-murder of an eight-year-old girl near the Fulton County city of Canton , Ill . It was up to Judge Perry to answer the next question : Did the state have any basis for keeping Miller in custody ? <P> Judge Perry listened to arguments from both sides . Then he announced : " Petitioner should not be compelled to stand trial again . " And he added : " Here 's a man who 's been in the shadow of death for ten years . I do n't know but what the punishment that he has suffered has been worse than death itself . Based upon the record as the Supreme Court analyzed it and as I heard the evidence , it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's father , sitting in the courtroom , wept . Then he and his wife drove to Stateville Penitentiary . After ten years , during which he had faced execution ten separate times , their son , now 40 , walked through the gates pulling a handcart piled with his possessions . <P> Blood-Stained Pants . Miller 's ordeal began two days after the brutal crime incensed Canton on a Saturday afternoon in November 1955 . Because he had left town Saturday night in one of his boss 's cabs , the police suspected Miller and prodded his confused girl friend , Waitress Betty Baldwin , to sign a statement implicating him . After he was arrested , Miller was held incommunicado for 52 hours , denied counsel and told that one of his pubic hairs had been found in the child 's vagina . The police assured him that he was mentally ill and would go to a hospital if he confessed . They wrote his confession , and though he later recanted , it was deemed " voluntary " and used against him . <P> As physical evidence at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pair of " bloodstained " underpants that police had found one mile from the scene of the crime . The judge refused to let defense chemists analyze the pants , nor did Miller try them on . Miller usually wore boxer-type shorts ; these were jockey type , and looked too small for Miller . But with those shorts , Miller 's confession and his girl friend 's testimony , Ramsey won the case hands down . <P> For seven years , the case bounced through nine appeals in state and federal courts . The strain was so great on Miller , who could only sit and wait on death row , that he was twice transferred to the psychiatric ward . Seven and a half hours before he was scheduled to be electrocuted in 1963 , Miller won a stay for a federal habeas corpus hearing before Judge Perry , who heard testimony that raised troubling questions about the evidence in the 1956 trial .
