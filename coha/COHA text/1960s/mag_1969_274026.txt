In the earlier years of the jet age , swiftly growing travel and the sheer efficiency of the new planes sent airline stocks soaring - in some cases more than 1,000% . " Many a house was built on the profits that people made from 1961 through 1966 in their airline investments , " says Bache &; Co . Analyst Henry Siegel . Now the airline stocks are no longer the high and the mighty . They are among the leaders in the market 's decline , down as a group by 37% since the beginning of the year . The drop is accelerating : the index of air stocks fell by a startling 11% in five trading days two weeks ago and again by 6% last week . TWA , Pan American and Western Airlines skipped their second-quarter dividends because of sharply reduced earnings . <P> Costly Steaks . The industry makes no attempt to gloss over the serious de terioration of its finances . To get at least temporary relief , it is negotiating in Washington for the second fare in crease this year . Air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. economy , since , as one air line executive puts it , " vacation dollars are expendable dollars . " Inflation and the incipient economic slowdown have cut into travel for both business and pleasure . In the first six months of 1969 , passenger travel rose 11% from the 1968 level , 4% less than anticipated . During June , six of the eleven trunk carriers reported significantly lower increases . <P> To break even , generally 50% of the seats on jets have to be filled . The load factor , which averaged 53.7% in the first half of 1968 , was down to 50.3% this year . Industry analysts say that every 1% drop in the load factor costs American Airlines , for example , at least $10 million in annual earnings . <P> Much of the trouble is the result of fierce competition among the carriers . <P> They keep adding bigger and costlier planes to their fleets and try to attract more business with lures like family-fare reductions . Northeast Airlines had a first-half loss of $1,289,000 . At least some of that can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's high cost of living up to its billing as " the all-steak airline . " * <P> New Routes . The competition is heightened by the Civil Aeronautics Board , which generously grants new routes to satisfy every line so far as possible . After ten years of investigations , reviews , reversals and reappraisals , the CAB last week brought the hotly contentious Hawaii-route case to a characteristically unsatisfactory close . Where only Pan American , Northwest and United Airlines have competed in the past , eight carriers will now vie for a share of the market . As a result , profits on the Hawaii run are likely to be marginal at best . In anticipation of the award , Western Airlines alone added 35 planes to its fleet , and it blames the delay in the CAB ruling for 31% of the line 's $5,100,000 loss during the first five months of 1969 . The long-disputed South Pacific route award finally went to American Airlines , which will fly to Australia , the Fiji Islands and New Zealand . In addition , the CAB last week granted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vast " Southern Tier " stretching from Florida to California .
