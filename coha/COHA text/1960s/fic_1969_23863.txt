65 SINCE WHEN DO THEY CHARGE ADMISSION a story by Wright Morris On the morning they left Kansas , May had tuned in for the weather and heard of the earthquake in San Francisco , where her daughter , Janice , was seven months pregnant . So she had called her . Her husband , Vernon Dickey , answered the phone . He was a native Californian so accustomed to earthquakes he thought nothing of them . It was the wind he feared . When I read about those twisters , " he said to May , " I do n't know how you people stand it . " He would n't believe that May had never seen a twister till she saw one on TV , and that one in Missouri . " Ask him about the riots , " Chif had asked her . " What riots , Mrs. Chalmers ? " 66 SINCE WHEN DO THEY CHARGE ADMISSION It was no trouble for May to see that Janice could use someone around the house to talk to . She was like her father , Cliff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her sister . Charlene would talk the leg off a stranger but the girls had never talked much to each other . But now they would , once the men got out of the house . It had been Cliff 's idea to bring Charlene along since she had never been out of Kansas , She had never seen an ocean . She had never been higher than Estes Park . On their way to the beach , Charlene cried , " Look ! Look ! " She pointed into the sunlight ; May could see the light shimmering on the water . " That 's the beach , " said Janice . " Just look , " Charlene replied . " You folks come over here often ? " asked Cliff . " On Vernon 's days off , " replied Janice . " If it 's a weekday , " said May , " you would n't find ten people on a beach in Merrick County . " " You would n't because there 's no beach for them to go to , " said Janice . Cliff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was what she was stuck with . He did n't like it , himself . Nothing had its own place . Hardly any of the corners were square . All through the Sunday morning service he could hear the plastic propellers spinning at the corner gas station , and the loud bang when they checked the oil and slammed down the hood . Vernon Dickey took it all in his stride , the way he did the riots . Janice said , " Vernon 's mother ca n't understand anybody who lives where they have dust storms . " " I 'd rather see it blow than feel it shake , " said Cliff . " Ho  --  ho ! " said Vernon . " I suppose it 's one thing or another , " said May . " When I read about India I 'm always thankful . " Cliff honked his horn at the sharp turns in the road . The fog stood offshore just far enough to let the sun shine yellow on the beach sand . At the foot of the slope the beach road turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them a chain , stretched between two posts , blocked the road . On the left side a portable contractor 's toilet was brightly painted with green and yellow flowers . A cardboard sign attached to the chain read , Admission 500 . " Since when do they charge admission ? " Janice asked . She looked at her husband , a policeman on his day off . As Cliff stopped the car a young man in the booth put out his head . " In heaven 's name , " May said . She had never seen a man with such a head of hair outside of The National Geographic . He had a beard that seemed to grow from the hair on his chest . A hrass padlock joined the ends of a chain around his neck . " How come the fifty-cent fee ? " said Vernon . " It 's a public beach . " " It 's a racket , " said the youth . " You can pay it or not pay it . " He did n't seem to care At his hack stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a smiling , vacant , pimpled face . She was eating popcorn ; the butter and salt greased her lips . " I do n't know why anyone should pay it , " said May . " Cliff , drive ahead . " Cliff said , " You like to lower the chain ? " When the boy stepped from the booth he had nothing on but a jockstrap . The way his plump buttocks were tanned it was plain that was all he was accustomed to wear . He stooped with his backside toward the car , but the hood was between him and the ladies . As the chain slacked Cliff drove over it , slowly , into the parking lot . " What in the world do you make of that ? " asked May . " He 's a hippie , " said Janice . " They 're hippies . " " Now I 've finally seen one , " said May . She twisted in the seat to take a look back . " Maybe they 're having a love-in down here , " said Vernon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a sense of humor that stayed within bounds . " Park anywhere , " said Janice . " You come down here alone ? " asked May . Vernon said , " Mrs. Chalmers , you do n't need to worry . They 're crazy but they 're not violent . " Cliff maneuvered between the trucks and cars to where the front wheels thumped against a driftwood log . The sand began there , some of it blowing in the offshore breeze . The tide had washed up a sandbar , just ahead , that concealed the beach and most of the people on it . Way over , maybe five or ten miles , was the coastline just west of the Golden Gate , with the tier on tier of houses that Cliff knew to be Daly City , From the bridge , on the way over , Vernon had pointed it out . Vernon and Janice had a home there , but they wanted something more out in the open , nearer the beach , As a matter of fact , Cliff had come up with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He and May lived in a house that he had built . If Vernon would come up with the piece of land , Cliff would more or less promise to put a house on it . Vernon would help him on the weekends , and his days off . " What about a little place over there , " said Cliff , and wagged his finger at the slope near the beach . Right below it were the huge rocks black as the water , but light on their tops . That was gull Wright Morris spent his boyhood in Nebraska , went to Pomona College , and now lives across the Gate from San Francisco . His novel , " The Field of Vision , " won the National Book Award ( 1957 ; his most recent book is " God 's Country and My People , " with photos and text . dung . One day some fellow smarter than the rest would make roof tiles or fertilizer out of it . " Most of the year it 's cold and foggy , " said Vernon , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a cold , windy beach ? " said May . She had turned to take the whip of the wind on her back . No one answered her question . It did n't seem the right time to give it much thought . Cliff got the picnic basket out of the rear and tossed the beach blanket to Vernon . There was enough sand in it , when they shook it , to blow back in his face . " Just like at home , " Cliff said to Vernon , who guffawed . Vernon had been born and raised in California , but he had got his Army training near Lubbock , Texas , where the dust still blew . Now he led off toward the beach , walking along the basin left where the tide had receded . Charlene trailed along behind him wearing the flowered pajama suit she had worn since they left Colby , on the fourth of June . They had covered twenty-one hundred and forty-eight miles in five days and half of one night , Cliff at the wheel . Charlene could drive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interstate freeways , where they drove so fast . There was a time , every day , about an hour after lunch , when nothing Cliff could think or do would keep him from dozing off . He 'd jerk up when he 'd hear the sound of gravel or feel the pull of the wheel on the road 's shoulder . Then he 'd be good for a few more miles till it happened again . The score of times that happened Cliff might have killed them all but he could n't bring himself to pull over and stop . It scared him to think of the long drive back . " Except where it was green , in Utah , " said May , " it 's looked the same to me since we left home . " " Mrs. Chalmers , " said Vernon , " you should 've sat on the other side of the car . " It was enlightening to Cliff , after all he 'd heard about the population explosion , to see how wide open and empty most of the country was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone in it . The best time of day was the forty miles or so he got in before breakfast . They slipped by so easy he sometimes felt he would just like to drive forever , the women in the car quiet until he stopped for food . Anything May saw before she had her coffee was lost on her . After breakfast Cliff did n't know what seemed longer : the day he put in waiting for the dark , or the long night he put in waiting for the light . He had forgotten about trains until they had to stop for the night . Vernon said , " I understand that when they take the salt out of the water there 'll he no more water problems . Is that right , Mr. Chalmers ? " Like her mother , Charlene said , ' ' There 'll just be others . " Was there anything Cliff had given these girls besides a poor start ? He turned to see how Janice , who was seven months pregnant , was making out . The way her feet had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was no taller than her mother . With their backsides to the wind both women looked broad as a barn . One day Janice was a girl  --  the next day you could n't tell her from her mother . That part of her life that she looked old would prove to be the longest , but seem the shortest . Her mother hardly knew a thing , or cared , about . what had happened since the war . The sight of anything aging , or anything just beginning , like that unborn child she was lugging , affected Cliff so strongly he could wet his lips and taste it . Where did people get the strength to do it all over again ? He turned back to face the beach and the clumps of people Nilo were sitting around , or lying . One played a guitar . A wood fire smoked in the shelter of a few smooth rocks . Vernon said , " It 's like the coast of Spain . " Cliff could believe it might well be true : it looked old and bleak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozen dogs ran up and down , yapping like kids . " Dogs are fun ! They just seem to know almost everything . " This side of Charlene made her good with her kids , but Cliff sometimes wondered about her husband . " How 's this ? " said Vernon , taking Cliff by the arm , and indicated where he thought they should spread the blanket . On one side were two boys , stretched out on their bellies , and nearer at hand was this blanket-covered figure , his back humped up . His problem seemed to be that he could n't find a spot in the sand to his liking . He squirmed a good deal . Now and then his backside rose and fell . Cliff took one end of the blanket and Vernon the other , and they managed to hold it against the wind , flatten it to the sand . Charlene plopped down on it to keep it from blowing . It seemed only yesterday that Cliff and his father would put her in a blanket and toss her like a pillow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those girls who was more like a boy in the way nothing faxed her . Out of the water , toward Vernon , a girl came running so wet and glistening she looked naked . " Look at that ! " said Cliff , and then stood there , his mouth open , looking . She was actually naked . She ran right up and passed him . her feet kicking wet sand on him , then she dropped to lie for a moment on her face , then roll on her back . Only the gold-flecked sand clung to her white belly and breasts . Grains of the sand , cinnamon colored , clung to her prominent , erectile nipples . Her eyes were closed , her head tipped to the left to avoid the wind . For a long moment Cliff gazed at her body as if in thought . When he blinked his eyes the peculiar thing was that he was the one who felt in the fishbowl . Surrounded by them . What did they think of a man down at the beach with all his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blanket and turned to see Vernon pointing at the women . They waddled along like turtles . All he could wonder was what had ever led them to 68 SINCE WHEN DO THEY CHARGE ADMISSION come to a beach . Buttoned at the collar , Janice 's coat draped about her like a tent she was dragging . Cliff just stood there till they came along beside him , and May put out a hand to lean on him . Sand powdered her face . " It 's always so windy ? " she asked Vernon . " You folks call this windy ? " May looked closely at him to see if he meant to be taken seriously . He surely knew , if he knew anything , that she knew more about wind than he did . " Get Cliff to tell you how it blows around Chadron , " she said . " It blows the words right out of your mouth if you 'd let it . " Cliff was silent , so she added , " Do n't it Cliff ? " " Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to turn so that his eyes went to the humped squirming figure , under the blanket . The humping had pulled it up so the feet were uncovered . Four of them . Two of them were toes down , with tar spots on the bottoms ; two of them were toes up , the heels dipped into the sand . In a story Cliff had heard but never fully understood the point had hinged on the four-footed monster . Now he got the point . " Blow the words right out of your mouth if you 'd let it , " said May . At a loss for words , Cliff moved to stand so he blocked her view . IIe took a grip on her hands and let her sag , puffing sour air at him , down to the blanket . " It 's hard enough work just to get here , " she said , and raised her eyes to squint at the water . " Charlene , you wanted to see the ocean : well , there it is , " Cliff was thinking that Charlene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was hard to understand her . She had had three children without ever growing up . " If I 'd know the sand was going to blow , " said May , " we 'd have stayed home to eat , then come over later . I. hate sand in my food . Charlene , you going to sit down ? " Charlene stood there staring at a girl up to her ankles in the shallow water . She stooped to hold a child pressed to her front , the knees buckled up as if she squeezed it . A stream of water arched from the slit between the child 's legs . The way she held it , pressed to her front , it was like squeezing juice from a bladder . There was nothing Cliff could do but wait for it to stop . Charlene 's handbag dangled to where it almost dragged in the sand . " That 's Farrallon Island , " said Vernon , pointing . Without his glasses Cliff could n't see it . Janice tipped forward , as far as she could , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't reach her feet . " We hear and read so much about the California beaches , but nothing about their being so dirty , " said May . " It 's the hippies , " said Vernon . " They 've taken it over . " Why was he such a fool as to say so ? Even Cliff , who knew what he would see , twisted his head on his neck and looked all around him . The stark naked girl had dried a lighter color : she did n't look so good . The sand sprinkled her like brown sugar , but the mole-colored nipples were flat on her breasts , like they 'd been snipped off . At her feet , using her legs as a backrest , a lank-haired boy , chewing blowgum , sunned his pimpled face . On his hairless chest someone had painted his nipples to look like staring eyes . Now that Cliff was seated it was plainer than ever what was going on under the blanket : the heels of two of the feet thrust deep into the sand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Janice on the back of his head , but he missed those of her mother . Where were they ? " Cliff , " she said . He did not turn to look , " Cliff , " she repeated . At the edge of the water a dappled horse galloped with two long-haired naked riders . If one was a boy , Cliff could n't tell which was which . " Who 's ready for a beer ? " asked Vernon , and peeled the towel off the basket . When no one replied he said , " Mr. Dickey , have yourself a beer , " and took one . He moved the basket of food to where both Cliff and the women could reach it . Along with the bowl of potato salad there were two broiled chickens from the supermarket , The chickens were still warm . " All I 've done since we left home is eat , " Cliff said . " We just ate , " said Janice . " We did n't drag all this stuff here , " said Cliff , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He took out the bowl of salad . He fished around in the basket for the paper cups and plates . He did n't look up at May until he knew for certain she had got her head and eyes around to the front . The sun glinted on her glasses . Absent-mindedly she raked her fingers across her forehead for loose strands of hair . " We eat the salad first or along with the chicken ? " None of the women made any comment . One of the maverick beach dogs , his coat heavy with sand , stood off a few yards and sniffed at the chicken . " They should n't allow dogs on a beach , " said Cliff . " They run around and get hot and ca n't drink the water . In the heat they go mad . " " There 's salt in there somewhere , " said Janice . " I do n't put all the salt I could on the salad . " Cliff took out one of the chickens , and using his fingers pried the legs off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and placed the pieces on one of the plates . " You still like the dark meat ? " he said to Charlene . She nodded her head . He peeled the plastic cover off the potato salad and forked it out on the paper plates . " Fat it before the sand gets at it , " he said , and passed a plate to May . Janice reached to take one , and placed it on the slope of her lap . Vernon took the body of one of the birds , tore off the wings , and tossed one to the dog . " I ca n't stand to see a dog watch me eat , " he said . " Vernon was in Korea for a year , " said Janice . Cliff began to eat . After the first few swallows it tasted all right . He had n't been hungry at all when he started , but now he ate like he was famished . When he traveled all he seemed to do was sit and eat . He glanced up to see that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat there . She had her head cocked sidewise as if straining to hear something . Not twenty yards away a boy plucked a guitar but Cliff did n't hear a sound with the wind against him . Two other boys , with shorts on , one with a top on , lay out on their bellies with their chins on their hands . One used a small rock to drive a short piece of wood into the sand . It was the idle sort of play Cliff would expect from a kid about six , not one about twenty . On the sand before them a shadow flashed and eight or ten feet away a bird landed , flapping its wings . Cliff had never set eyes on a bigger crow . He was shorter in the leg but as big as the gulls that strutted on the firm sand near the water . A little shabby at the tail , big glassy hatpin eyes . Cliff watched him clip his beak into the sand like one of these glass birds that go on drinking water , rocking on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you , bird , come here ! " and wiggled a finger at him . When the bird did just that Cliff could n't believe his eyes . He had a stiff sort of strut , pumping his head , and favored one leg more than the other . No more than two feet away from the heads of those boys he stopped and gave them a look . Either one of them might have reached out and touched him . Cliff had never seen a big , live bird as tame as that . The crows around Chadron were smarter than most people and had their own meetings and cawed crow language . They had discussions . You could hear them decide what to do next . The boy with the rock held it out toward him and damn if the crow did n't peck at it . Cliff could hear the click of his beak tapping the rock . He turned to see if May had caught that , but her eyes were on the plate in her lap . " May , look ? " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen all T want to see the rest of my life . " " The crow ? " said Cliff , and took another look at him . He had his head cocked to one side , like a parrot , and his beak clamped down on one of the sticks driven into the sand . He tried to wiggle it loose as he tugged at it . He braced his legs and strained back like a robin pulling a worm from a hole . So Vernon would n't miss it , Cliff put out his hand to nudge him . " Well , I 'll be damned , " Vernon said . Two little kids , one with a plastic pail , ran up to within about a yard of the bird , stopped and a story by Wright Morris 69 stared . He stared right back at them . Who was to say which of the two looked the strangest . The kids were naked as the day they were born . One was a boy . Whatever they had seen before they had never seen a crow that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the boy with the rock , and waved it . Nobody would ever believe it , but that bird took a tug at the stick , then rocked back and cawed . He made such a honk the kids were frightened . The little girl backed off and giggled . The crow clamped his beak on the stick again and had another try . A lanky-haired hippie girl , just out of the water , ran up and said , " Sam  --  are they teasing you Sam ? " She had on no top at all but a pair of blue-jean shorts on her bottom . " Come on bird ! " yelled the boy with the rock , and pounded his fists on the sand . That crow had figured out a way to loosen up the stick by clamping down on it , hard , then moving in a circle , like he was drilling a well . He did that twice , then he pulled it free , clamped one claw on it , and cawed . " Good bird ! " said the boy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crow would n't let him . He backed off , flapped his wings , and soared off with his legs dangling . Cliff could see what it took a big bird like that to fly . " What does he do with it ? " said the girl . She looked off toward the cliffs where the bird had flown . Somewhere up there he had a lot of sticks : no doubt about that . " Buries it , " said the boy , " He thinks it 's a bone . " The little girl with the plastic pail said , " Why do n't you give him a real bone , then ? " The boy and girl laughed . The hippie girl said , " Can I borrow a comb ? " and the boy replied , " If you do n't get sand in it . " He moved so he could reach the comb in his pocket , and stroked it on his sleeve as he passed it to her . Combing her hair , her head tipped back , Cliff might have mistaken her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When will he do it again ? " " Soon as he 's buried it , " said the boy . Cliff did n't believe that . He had watched crows all his life , but he had never seen a crow behave like that . He wanted to bring the point up , but how could he discuss it with a girl without her clothes on ? " Here he comes , " said the boy , and there he was , his shadow flashing on the sand before them . He made a circle and came in for a landing on the firm sand . What if he did bury those sticks ? His beak was shiny yellow as a banana . " Come here , bird ! " said the boy , and held out the rock , but the girl leaned forward and grabbed it from him . " You want to hurt him ? " she cried . " Why do n't you give him a real bone ? " She looked around as if she might see one , raking the sand with her hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cliff , and held the chicken leg out toward her . He could no more help himself than duck when someone took a swing at 70 SINCE WHEN DO THEY CHARGE ADMISSION him . On her hands and knees the girl crawled toward him to where she could reach it . Her lank hair framed her face . " There 's meat on it , " she said . " Do n't you worry , " said Cliff , " crows like meat . They 're really good meat eaters . " She looked at him closely to see how he meant that . About her neck a fine gold-colored chain dangled an ornament . Cliff saw it plainly . Two brass nails were twisted to make some sort of puzzle . She looked at the bone Cliff had given her , the strip of meat on it , and turned to hold it out to the bird . He limped forward like he was trained and took it in his beak . Cliff caught his eye , and what worried him was that he might want to crow over it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drop it and have to gulp down sandy meat . But that bird actually knew he had something unusual since he did n't put it down to clamp his claws on it . Instead he strutted . Up and down he went , like a sailor with a limp . Vernon laughed so hard he gave Cliff a slap on the knee . " Do n't laugh at him , " said the girl , and when she put out her hand he limped toward her to where she could touch him , stroking with her fingers the flat top of his head . The little boy suddenly yelled and ran around them in a circle , kicking up sand , and hooting . The crow took off . The heavy flap of his wings actually stirred the hair of the boy who was lying there , nearest to him ; he raised one of his hands to wave as the bird soared away . " I never seen anything like it ! " said Vernon . " Maybe you 'd like to come oftener . " Janice picked at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ? " asked Cliff . " You get to see him ? " " We can go now if you men have eaten . " May made a wad of the napkin and scraps in her lap , put them under the towel and plates in the basket . Vernon said . " Honey , you see that crazy bird ? " Janice shaded her eyes with one hand , peered at the sky . Up there , high , a bird was wheeling . Cliff took it for a gull . The wind had caked the color she had put on her lips , and sand powdered the wrinkles around her eyes . Cliff remembered they were called crow 's feet , which was how they looked . Now she lowered her hand and held it out to Vernon to pull her up . The sand caught up in the folds of her dress blew over May and the girl lying behind her , one arm across her face . " People must be crazy to come and eat on a beach , " said May . Cliff pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers . He helped Vernon with the blanket , walking toward the water where they could shake it and not disturb people . A bearded youth without pants , but with a striped T-shirt , sat with crossed legs on the edge of the water . The horse that had galloped off to the south came galloping back with just one rider on it . Cliff could see it was a girl . Janice and her mother had begun the long walk back toward the car . Along the way they passed the naked girl , still sprawled on her back . " She 's going to get herself a sunburn , " said Vernon . To Charlene Cliff said , " You see that bird ? " Charlene nodded . " Just remember you did , when I ask you . Nobody back in Chadron is going to believe me if you do n't . " " What bird was it ? " asked May . " A crow , " said Cliff . " I would think you 'd seen enough of crows , " said May . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beach . The tide had washed up a sort of reef so that he could no longer see the water . The girl and the dogs that ran along it were like black paper cutouts . Nobody would know if she had her clothes on or off . He had forgotten to check on the two of them who had been squirming under the blanket . One still lay there . The other one crouched with lowered head , as if reading something . From the back Cliff would n't know which one was the girl . May said , " I 've never before really believed it when I said that I ca n't believe my eyes , but now 1 believe it . " " You would n't believe them if you 'd seen that crow , " said Cliff . " I did n't come all this way to look at a crow , " she replied . They all got into the car , and Cliff put the picnic basket into the rear . He took a moment , squinting , to see if the crazy bird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just thought , he would have given the girl the other two legs to feed him . " I 'd like a cup of coffee , " said May , " but I 'm willing to wait till we get home for it . " Vernon said , " Mr. Chalmers , you like me to drive ? " Cliff agreed that he would . They went out through the gate where they had entered but the boy and the girl had left the booth . The chain was already half-covered with drifting sand . " It 's typical of your father , " said May , " to drive all the way out here and look at a crow . " Charlene said , " Wait until I tell Leonard ? " They looked to see what she would tell him . On the dry slope below them a small herd of cattle were being fed from a hovering helicopter . Bundles of straw were dropped to spread on the slope . " If I were you , " said May , " I 'd tell him about that and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He stopped it and said , " Charlene , now you tell him about that crow . What 's a few crazy people to one crow in a million ? " There was no comment . " We 're going up now , " said Vernon . " You feel that poppin ' in your ears ?
