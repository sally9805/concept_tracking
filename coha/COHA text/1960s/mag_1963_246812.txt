For the seventh time since World War II , the Federal Reserve Board last week made it harder for investors to buy stock with borrowed money . It did so by raising the so-called margin requirements from 50% to 70%-meaning that to pick up $1,000 worth of listed stock , an investor will have to put down at least $700 . The Fed 's seven governors , who often split on other matters , voted unanimously for the " precautionary " boost . But they passed the word around that they plan no further movement of margins for quite a time . <P> <P> Why the increase last week ? The Fed believes that the recent flurry of stock splits and dividend increases has at last begun to tempt many small investors back to the market , and it wants to protect them from going too far out on a limb . Loans for stock purchases have jumped 43% in the past 16 months to $6.9 billion . While this is little more than 1% of the value of the shares on the New York Stock Exchange , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time for tightening , and felt that the market was strong enough to take the margin increase . <P> Stronger Footing . When margins have been raised in the past , the market has usually responded by dropping for a fortnight or so , then climbing anywhere from 5% to 27% for three months to a year before topping out . Last week the Dow-Jones industrial in dex worried off 5.19 points in the first day after the hike , but came back 6.78 points in the next two days to close the week at 750.81 . Where the market will move next depends much less upon margins than upon the soundness of the U.S. economy . As of last week , U.S. business was climbing toward all kinds of new records in 1963 : a $584 billion gross national product , $462 billion in personal income , $27 billion in aftertax corporate profits . <P> The Dow-Jones index has risen 40% since June 1962 , and the market is on much firmer ground than it was at the time of its previous peak in December 1961 . The average price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earnings now v. 25 times earnings then . Of the 30 Dow-Jones blue chips , 18 are selling for less now than at the end of 1961 , although their profits are generally higher . ( The index is up largely because of strong gains by eight stocks : Chrysler , G.M. , International Harvester , General Electric , Texaco , Standard Oil of New Jersey , Standard Oil of California and Sears . ) <P> Fastest Risers . Of 1,140 stocks on the Big Board , 880 have risen and 250 have fallen this year . The fastest risers lately have been the manufacturers of color-TV sets and office equipment , while the laggards have been the space and defense stocks . As of last week , brokers were generally bullish about many drug producers , airlines and electronics companies , and down on hotel chains , real estate firms , savings and loan associations . Perhaps it is time to be wary when most Wall Streeters start talking alike , and perhaps the market will take a beating if tax-cut hopes fail . But there is a consensus on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still plenty of margin at the top .
