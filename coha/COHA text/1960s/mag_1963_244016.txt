On the face of it , Peru last week had as much reason for rejoicing as Argen tina . After free elections , the military junta that had been running the country for more than a year stepped peacefully aside for the inauguration of President Fernando Belande Terry , 50 , a vigorous and ambitious architect . Peru 's economy , left in good shape by the sound policies of ex-Premier Pedro Beltrn , and well tended by the interim military government , was in blooming health . The sol is one of the solidest currencies in Latin America . Foreign reserves stand at a fat $106 million , old industries like copper mining are expanding , and new industries like fish-meal fertilizer are running strong . <P> Now it is time , Belande feels , to be gin bridging the deadly gulf between Peru 's haves and have-nots by develop ing the nation that lies beyond the cities and the factories . During his campaign , Belande journeyed to the remote out back of eastern Peru by canoe and mule team ; ever since , he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea , beyond the Andes . To open up the area to farmers and livestock producers , he talks of a new $216 million highway with almost mystical fervor . Another ambition is to start communal self-help programs , following a pattern set back in the old Inca empire days . <P> Across his path stand barriers of political enmity and grudge . A year ago , in a disputed three-way election , old-time Revolutionary Victor Ral Haya de la Torre , 68 , beat Belande by a bare 12,867 votes , but did not win the legally required one-third majority . The army , which bitterly dislikes Haya , an nulled the election and took over the country . Fairly defeated this time by Belande but still feeling cheated , Haya last week joined political forces with the third candidate , ex-Dictator General Manuel Odra , 65 , to form an alliance in Congress giving them a clear majority over Belande . Then as an added slight to Belande , and an added complication to a nation that badly needs political tranquillity , Haya disappeared from Lima just as Belande @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
