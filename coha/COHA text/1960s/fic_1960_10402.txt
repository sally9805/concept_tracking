DAVENPORTMrs . Murdoch was adept at climbing out of this type of debris and springing neatly to the top of a new and seemingly sound replacement , strewing blame and epithets on the discarded husbandswho were solely in the wrong . But Harriet was not like her . At these times of troubled and questioning mood she tended increasingly to look the truth in the face and blame herself for five years of waste and futility . There had been seven altogether , but during the first two her husband was away at the Korean War , it had been a hasty marriageon the eve of his departure . Thank God , said Mrs. Murdoch , within a short time of his leaving , that you are n't going to have a baby . You never know about a war , it would be such a bore , darling , if anything happened and you were saddled with a baby . Mrs. Murdoch would have thought it the end , in her chirping vernacular , for someone to want a child in the very event that her husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such depths of feeling about Norton Piers at that time , and when he returned home and set about compensating himself for the lost time , money , and pleasure that his country had exacted of him , he did it in a sizable way . He was successful at business , avid for sport , amusement , and motion ; he was attractive to women , restless , thoughtless , and rich . Neither he nor Harriet looked upon their life as a reservoir into which to pour the components of a long and fruitful future . On the contrary , they treated it as a sort of Jack Homer 's pie , out of which they pulled the noisy and glittering baubles of an existence as nearly like a continuous party as they could make it . When Harriet 's share of the toys proved to be jewels , furs , sports cars , trips to Sun Valley or Nassau , it was all very gay ; but when his proved to be pretty women Harriet exploded in tantrums of rage and jealousy , kicking the pie from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE CONSTANT IMAGEIt is not worth thinking about , she told herself now , as she went to get rid of the mussed-up feeling inevitable at the end of a long city day . She took off her smart grey wool suit , almost the daytime uniform of Milano , deceptively easy in cut , with its supple pullover of shaded soft greys beneath ; treed her brown crocodile pumps ; whisked off her underclothes , and left the lot in the guarderoba where Angela did her laundry , pressing , and sewing . She put on a dressing-gown and started the water for a hot bath , throwing in some borax to counteract the alkalinity of the water and a generous measure of scented drops which filled the room with cosseting fragrance . It is just as luxurious here , she reflected , as the way I have always lived , and in many things more so ; but far fewer people here are so indulged , and I have seen enough of the miles of streets outside this select quarter , of the working-class outskirts like Sesto and Niguarda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the people 's homes are like . Dark and cold , she knew , because fuel and electricitywere dreadfully expensive ; cramped because families stuck together , partly for love and partly to pool their wages and make for all together a better life than their members could have had apart . Stepping into the water , letting herself be lapped by steamingripples , she saw the one clear thread which ran straight through this world from top to bottom , one key to every human pattern at every level from the grossly rich to the desperately poor : their family , their love for it which like all real love comprisedmost other emotions , even to jealousy and hate ; their acceptance of its burdens which they regarded without protest or surprise . Perhaps , she mused , perhaps their religion is at the bottom of it , but many of them would deny that , and all are so steeped in their habitude that it would never occur to them to examine its origins. 40 41MARCIA DAVENPORT As a result , she would be hard put to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italian in her own situation : alone . Much of the time the fact did not trouble her , to many Amer- icans it was more or less the norm , and with a mother like hers , certainly so . Her own childlessness was only to be expected in such a marriage as hers had been , but lately she had been looking back with open eyes and recognizing deeper reasons for it than the life of selfish extremes , from pleasure to uproar , which she and her husband had lived . It had been easy to rationalize that it would be unfair to a child to bring it into such a situation . But she could put her finger now on other motives , and feel the force of their gravity even while conceding that it was as well no child had had to suffer the least consequence of the mess that she and Norton Piers had made . This afternoon , lying on one side of Lydia Marchisi 's vast double bed , where they had flopped down for their nap after coming in from luncheon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squarely in the eye . For a time they had both slept . But Harriet , on waking from that deep velvet sleep of mid- afternoon , which seems more profound than any other and car- ries deception in its soft sleeves , looked at her watch . Twenty minutes !  --  and she could have sworn , struggling up from bliss- ful submergence , that it had been ten times as long . Lydia , in a poem of a negligee , lay on her side , her hands folded beneath her cheek , drawing the deep , regular breaths of a child ; and her beauty , free of the monitor which was her use and awareness of it , bloomed as spontaneously as a wildflower . Harriet lay very still on her back , careful not to rouse Lydia , though she smiled at the thought . Sharing this bed for ten years with her husband , Lydia would hardly be disturbed by such a light motion as anything that Harriet would do . But after a time Lydia opened her eyes . The room was nearly dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and half-past four on such an afternoon could look like night . Lydia yawned , stretched , and made a soft sound , too pretty to be called a little grunt . She pressed the bell for her maid who came to close the shutters and curtains and turn on the lights . " Tea , darling ? " she asked Harriet . " Heavens , no ! We 've just lunched . " " Not just a cuppa ? With nothing to eat ? " " No , really . " " Give me a glass of mineral water , " said Lydia to the maid ; " and the Signora too . " But when the girl had gone , silently closing the door , Lydia put the full glass on the table and lay back with her arms beneathher head . Harriet still lay without moving , tracing the delicategilded mouldings of the ceiling with her eyes . It was so pleasant , so much part of a wonderfully agreeable fantasy ; this waking just now had startled her briefly while shining little pieces fell into the pattern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sharing Lydia 's cocoon , it was tempting to slip away again into the stream of lovely unreality . She saw no reason for resisting . Lydia said presently , in a thoughtful voice , " You know , I should n't be surprised if I were n't going to have another baby . " " Oh , darling ! " To Harriet this sounded like the most beatific thing a woman could have to tell , but she had heard varying views from other people she knew , and her joyful exclamation became subdued to , " Would you be pleased ? " " I 'm pleased with my family as it is , " said Lydia slowly . " In all truth , we had n't intended this , if it 's so , but  --  " " Would Sandro be happy ? " 43MARCIA DAVENPORT " Of course . And so would I. " " Because he was happy , or because you would really be your- self ? " " Both . But there was a time when I might n't have been . I used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . After they had been silent for some time Lydia said , " When I married Sandro I had no idea how much I 'd have to change be- fore I could be contented here . I had a lot of trouble in the beginning . " She sighed . " So did Sandro . An Italian has no real idea what we are like . So long as he may be playing with one of us it does n't matter much  --  but when he marries , that 's dif- ferent . They expect a great deal of their wives . " " Do n't most Europeans ? In the ways you mean , more than American men ? " " You and I do n't know much about most Americans , Har- riet . I never thought of that when I was still there . We were born and brought up in a certain way which would be called upper-class in any other country  --  but that 's not said in ours . Women like your mother and my Aunt Kitten and the men they marry  --  people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amer- ican life . But marriage is marriage in Italy . " Harriet was silent , twisting an end of her hair round one finger . " They say themselves that it 's changing here too , " she said slowly . " You hear about all kinds of messes that people are in . " Lydia waved her hand . " Oh , I know . The Romans , some of the nobility , newspaper names  --  there are the same rotten spots on top of the pile in every country  --  on top where they show . But the real thing here is different . " " It 's made a tremendous change in you . " " I know it . And I like it , that 's what I meant . But it did n't 44 happen all at once . I had to get used to lots of things more worryingthan what would happen to my figure if I had a lot of children . " Harriet 's eyes slid sidewise to Lydia 's face ; perhaps some change of expression would tell her the answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lots of things ? " she echoed . " Really lots ? " Lydia laughed a little . " It looked like lots to me . Whatever else , it was a lot to learn . What it boiled down to , I suppose , was deciding whether I 'd grow up or not  --  according to Italian ideas . It would n't have been any use to cling to American ones . I had to fish or cut bait . " Harriet listened carefully , mentally applying the measure of Lydia 's conclusions to her own situation and all that had led up to it . She was rather surprised but gave no sign of it when Lydia said , " Some of the same medicine would n't do you any harm either , darling . " For a moment the possibility of some flippant reply hung on Harriet 's lips and died there . This whole conversation had turned unwontedly admonitory even as between the most intimate of friends ; it was probing an area where Harriet knew herself to be indefensible and she did not propose the dishonesty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I refused to fish or cut bait even at the level of marriage to Norton Piers . It 's the most dreadful sensation of waste , Lydia , nothing but those burnt-out years . We 're the same age , you and I. " " It would n't have done to have had a child in the circum-stances . " " That 's the way I explained it to myself . But  --  " They were silent for a time , while Lydia gingerly tried the experiment of lighting a cigarette , thought better of it , and4 cMARCIA DAVENPORTlaughed . " I have news for Papa , " she concluded . Harriet sat up and looked at the time again . " I must go , " she said . She did not want to be there when Sandro came in . " In time to be there if Carlino looks in on his way home ? " Harriet turned round , staring , and Lydia Marchisi saw the faint colour which swept up to her eyes . " Oh , do n't be shy about it , darling , " Lydia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new beauty in donkey 's years , and his taste is perfect , so it 's flattering . " " I do n't want to have an affair with him , " said Harriet abruptly . " He is absolutely charming , you could n't be more right . But  --  " she bit her lip . " I ca n't help seeing it from his wife 's point of view . " " Pina can take care of herself , " said Lydia soberly . " She 's had lots of practice . I do n't envy her , but it 's her life and she knows what to do about it . The main thing is , could you play his game and do it well if that 's what you want now ? It would n't do you any harm so long as you did n't get confused and go sentimentalor romantic  --  " " I know . " " And if it is n't to be you , from Carlo 's point of view it will be somebody else . " " I keep thinking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he , darling . That 's the whole point . Keep your eye fixed on that and you wo n't go wrong . " The last of the water had gurgled out of the tub , and Harriet was combing and patting her hair into place while it was damp from the steam , still thinking of her talk with Lydia , and still swayed by the current of question and dejection upon which she had come home . The clearest strain in her reasoning knew well that this winter 's interlude , whatever its yet undiscovered eleTHECONSTANT IMAGEments might be , was not part of her real future ; and her reason , as well as her instincts , knew that of course she was to have a future , no bit of which she could as yet foresee . She was young , she was independent , she was perfectly aware of her good looks and her other natural gifts . The year since she had returned from that horrible ranch in the West had not been without its possibilitiesfor a new resolution to her life , but she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the least similarity to the botch which had been her own experience of marriage , and her mother 's , and that of too many others she knew . Distance , suggested by Lydia Marchisi and friends in England , had seemed the best recourse , and she had been grateful for it . She had her distance , she reflected , getting into her dainty bed , comfortable with its reading-light and the pile of books , English and Italian , on the table beside her ; but with it she had a measure of desolation . She lay back on her pillows , eyeing through the open door and across the little hallway the roses spreading their loveliness in the sitting-room . The telephone rang . She did not answer it . It rang three times , four , five . Havingfollowed her intention to ignore the thing , Harriet now inconsequentlypicked it up . " At last ! " said Carlo Dalverio . " I have been ringing you all afternoon . " " I told you I would be out . " " Out ' can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your roses here when I came in . They are so beautiful , thank you very much . " " Roses ? " Tit for tat , thought Harriet . " Then who has sent me a mass of heavenly roses  --  " " No doubt the person with whom you were out ' . " 46 47MARCIA DAVENPORT " Lydia does n't send me flowers . " Harriet put a faint edge to her voice . " I send them to her . " He laughed . " Va bene . What would women do without their best friends ? I tell you , the mere sight of Riri Minghetti  --  " Harriet could imagine . " May I come in for a moment ? " he asked , quite meek . " Now ? " " Well , not later ! " " Really , Carlo , I 'm not free . I told you , not this evening . " " But only for a moment . " " No , not even for a moment . " " You are unkind . " " No I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , I was going to do that anyway . Before we go away on Friday . " " I forgot , I am lunching with you tomorrow , that should be enough of me before Friday . " " Lunch , yes ; and six o'clock too . Tell me , what did you do today ? " " But Carlo  --  " " Where did you lunch ? " " At the Ortolani , " she sighed . " Why do you ask so many questions ? " " Because I like to . I like to know everything . What are you wearing now ? " " An old tweed skirt , a baggy sweater  --  " " For this engagement which keeps you from seeing me ? " " It keeps me from seeing anybody , " she said . " I am in bed , with all the doors locked , and I am going to stay here . " " Then I am coming at once ! " " It wo n't do the least good . There 's no way of getting in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " No , seriously . I have a headache , I am tired , I feel like a bore . I need a rest . I 'll see you tomorrow . " " You are expecting a lover , " he said . " Every word you 've said proves it . " " I am going to hang up this telephone now . " " No you 're not . Who is he ? " " Do you think I 'd tell you ? " " I can find out . " " Then why ask ? They have a very inelegant phrase in the United States and I am going to use it . Good bye , now . " " Not now , not yet , please . " It took her almost ten minutes to bring the conversation to an end . She put down the telephone , laughing . But then as she leaned back on her pillows , expecting the nonsense of the past moments to reverberate pleasantly and carry her along for a little while , she was surprised to find the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , and contemplating the thought of tomorrow with a good deal of concern and doubt . Well , she told herself finally , this looks like an imminent case of fish or cut bait and I wonder which I am going to do. f8 49 4 ,  --   --  - *PNA DALVERIO , whose name was Giuseppina , was beautiful , faintly unanimated , if not phlegmatic , for an Italian , but with a quality of calm which suggested the deep-rooted resilience of a tree . She was indeed , in her immovable attachments , like a plant , and even her looks , the lengthened ovoid head , the ivory skin , the glossy , bronze-tinged light brown hair , the velvety eyes , brought to mind the thick-petalled flowers , the elliptical lacqueredleaves of the magnolia which grows in every Italian garden . She moved with a rhythm almost imperceptibly slower than that of other women of her age , who were touched by the urge to be of the day and the moment and the world whose new ways and tastes flowed into Italy and out again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a distinctive voice , throaty and suave , and she spoke in the manner of patrician Milanesi , faintly gargling her R 's ; but as in all else , her speech was more deliberate , and unlike many others she knew little English . She was untroubled by this . Many foreigners came to her house on the tide of Carlo 's increasingly international business and she placidly assumed that those who spoke no Italian would speak French . Harriet at the farther end of the table between Carlo Dalverioand Pina 's brother Paolo Verocchi could not but compareTHE CONSTANT IMAGEPina 's matriarchal calm with the bubbling iridescence of Tia Ortolani and her friends yesterday . She had seen Pina among those other people and knew her capable of the chatter they delighted in , but she was different in her own house , and so was the talk . Here were present Carlo 's mother , whom Harriet had not met before , his two children , Tonino and Lala , Paolo Verocchi'slovely and hugely pregnant wife , and the children 's Swiss Mademoiselle . The winter holidays were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautifully mannered and dressed , were prodigies at restraining their excitement without being told and speaking only when they were spoken to . The steaming , mouth-watering risotto with white truffles was going round the second time and Harriet refused it , but Carlo said , " Come now , you said you adored tartufi , and we ca n't have any nonsense about dieting here ! " " Risotto is very light , Signora , " said Carlo 's mother . " It does not make one fat . " Oh , no , of course not , thought Harriet , but she smiled at Pina and helped herself to a little more . " It 's too delicious to resist , " she said . " I ordered the truffles for you , " said Pina . " I remembered you like them . " " Are you enjoying Milano , Signora ? " asked Carlo 's mother , speaking across him to Harriet . There followed the inevitable talk about Harriet 's impressionsof Milano , how she had happened to come , how long she was planning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been doing . She felt clumsy going through this with Carlo Dalverio 's mother whilst he threw in an occasional word , but what else was there to do ? And through the veil of convention she felt the warm , likable personality of the handsome woman whom every-50 51MARCIA DAVENPORTbody called Signora Nora . They were such a large family , said the lady , smiling , that one had to have a label of one 's own and Harriet too was to call her Signora Nora . She was the archetype of well-preserved , expensively dressed Milanese matron , robust of figure , with well-coiffed iron-grey hair and the fine features and dark eyes which her son had inherited . She must be well past sixty , thought Harriet , for Carlo is about forty , but she does n't look it ; she has the look of the perennial mother and grandmother who has been as she is for years and is never going to look any older . " Tonino , " said Carlo , to change the subject , " did you go to try your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Papa . They fit perfectly and they will be sent this afternoon . What time are we leaving in the morning ? " " You are all going in the big giardinetta with the luggage and the skis . Bruno will come for Coco and Maria at seven sharp , " said Carlo to his sister-in-law . Her children were going with their cousins to Cortina because her new baby was due any day . " Are n't we to go with you , Papa ? " Lala 's disappointment gave him a pang . " Not in your new Ferrari ? " " Not this time , my precious . I want Bruno to drive you becausethe fog will be very bad at first and he has more patience than your Papa . " " More prudence , you mean , " said his brother-in-law . " And for once I want Mamma to myself , " said Carlo . " This is her vacation too . And besides , there 's no room in the Ferrari for all you goldfish . But I shall probably pass you somewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I might stop and take you and Maria in the shelf in back . We 'll see . " THE CONSTANT IMAGEThey had finished the meat course and were eating tangerines and dried fruits and walnuts . The last few moments at table were always given over to the children , all the conversation was for them . Harriet asked Tonino if he was good at skiing and he replied with modesty , " Well , for my age , I think not so bad , Signora . " He was eleven , his father murmured , laughing . " And you , Signora , do you like to ski ? " " I love it ! " This started a babble of enthusiastic questions . Everybody asked something : where did she ski , when had she learnt , was there good skiing in the United States , where had she skiied over here , had she ever been to Cortina ? No , she said regretfully , only to St. Moritz and St. Anton . And was n't she going this year ? Was she staying in the city all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with us ? " said Pina Dalverioin her calm , dark voice . " Yes , why do n't you ? " echoed the children , with the enthusiasm for a loved place which made them want to include everybody in its pleasures . Harriet smiled at Pina , keeping , she intended , exactly the same appearance of casual cordiality as that which had clothed Pina 's remark . But she was on her guard , wary as to what this really meant ; and conscious of the surprised discomfiture of Carlo on her left . He had not revealed it , he was saying , " What a good idea ! " but his brain was responding to a series of telegraphictaps which spelt , she thinks this has gone farther than it has , she is bringing up her big defences already , she is prepared to see it through . My God ! what women have to put up with , and what a woman Pina is ! He looked at his wife with an expression of immense pride and admiration . In a strange way52 53MARCIA DAVENPORThe had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distant sense of relief , that she said , " It is so kind and hospitableof you , Pina , I wish I could come , but I am going to Rome tonight to join some American friends for the New Year . " " Ah , well , " said Pina , rising , " another time , then . " " And are you going to Rome tonight ? " he asked , as soon as Angela had shown him in . Harriet raised her eyebrows . He could not have passed through the entrance hall without seeing her bags ready there . He probably thinks they 're empty , she thought . He thinks I 'm up to some kind of double-edgery and as a matter of fact , I am . She had declined to go to Rome when the Wainwrights had telephoned a day or two ago and begged her to come . " We 're flying home on the first , " Polly Wainwright said , " and there 's nowhere else we can go in between , we have n't time . But Stan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but glare at each other over a bottle of pop on New Year 's Eve . Do come down , it 'll be an excuse for a party . " Exactly the sort of party she would loathe ; the Wainwrights straining at their double leash , one or two characters from the expatriate fringes , somebody from the Embassy , somebody with a shopworn title .. . But that afternoon she had rung them back and changed her mind , had begged off from Lydia 's Capo d'Anno dinner to which she wanted to go , had booked her compartment in the sleeper . Why , she asked herself , choosing the clothes for Angela54THE CONSTANT IMAGEto pack , why have you let yourself in for this ? Why go at all , and why go two days before the wretched party ? Only because at the moment it had seemed important that Pina Dalverio never discover she had lied about going to Rome . Harriet had to assume that she knew exactly what Pina 's invitationmeant , and she had to act as though she had not understood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this facade of innocence and manners . How much effort was she really willingto make , and what was she to get out of it ? What would be the use of all this self-restraint and strict adherence to a code by which she had not lived before , and was not sure that she wanted to live by , now or in the future ? She was moving on the edge of a situation in which all these feints and devices were taken for granted because they must serve in the crucial capacity of masks , and was she partaking of all this without even a good reason ? Her answer came with a rush ; Carlo Dalverio had lifted her from her chair , wrapped his arms round Her , and was kissing her mouth with intense , absorbed passion . Harriet was taken unawares . The prelude of verbal pyrotechnics , teasing , and playing for time had ended with a crash . For an instant she was too stupefied to respond and for another , too shaken not to . She thought dizzily , thank God he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neck , I have no intention of doing so . " Cara , " he said , " come sei bella ! Come mi piaci ! " and continued to kiss her . She could not get her breath . If I do not want this , I must make it plain right now ; hurry , said something in her mind , hurry , or it will be too late . At last she drew her head away and freed her hands , to put them against his chest and hold him off , but his powerful sportsman 's arms held her in an arc against his body , and he stood looking at her face , his dark eyes55MARCIA DAVENPORTglowing . He was as eager , as delighted , as full of freshness and enthusiasm as if this were the most novel of pleasures for him . " Do you like me ? " he asked her in Italian , pressing her closer and pleading with his smile , his eyes , his muffled , vibrating voice . " Do you like me ? Tell me , tell me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " She would have preferred silence but it was impossible not to respond . He knew his power with women , everything she had heard about it slid across her mind and vanished , swept away by his unfeigned ardour . He was like a boy , a preposterous boy , to be sure ; but without a trace of the cynical detachment which the connoisseur is thought to bring to his pleasures . " Tell me , " he urged , his lips at her chin and her throat . " Tell me again . " She told him . " In Italian , " he said . " Only in Italian . " In Italian , then . It came more easily , it flowed . " Oh ! the meraviglia ! " he said , with surprise which in turn surprised her ; his voice was altogether different from that of his poised , fluent English ; it was deeper , rougher , a little husky , without resonance . This is not to be quick and easy , he thought , she is reluctant and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is not the slightest doubt of the eventual outcome . But she will not like it if I hurry her now , and this is enough worth doing to do it well . Yet he had contrived to move , still embracing her , in such a way that she felt free ; and he made an exclamation of delight as he bent his head to kiss her again and felt her arms go round him . " Cara ! " he murmured . " Cara Harriet ! What a pretty name , how graceful , how different ! Oh , how I like you ! Tell me , tell me ! " THE CONSTANT IMAGE " Oh , Carlo , " she said , and put her forehead against his chest . " That 's such a lovely phrase . Dimmi , dimmi , you all say it as if it did n't necessarily mean anything . " " And you do n't want it to mean anything ? " " I  --  I do n't know . Yet . I do n't know anything . " " Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of all there is to find out . Dio mio , we are going to have the most beautifultime ! " He looked again at her face , the dark hair and heavy brows almost startling as the pale , clear eyes gazed at him beneath them . " You are beautiful , " he said again . He studied her face . " All that I see and  --  " his hands moved delicately down her shoulders , her ribs , settled at her waist , caressed her hips "  --  all that I do n't . But I shall . Shall I ? " He shook her a little as if to scold . " Shall I ? " " Do you think so ? " He had to bend over her to hear . " Silly ! Silly Harriet ! ' When ? Tell me ! " Instead of answering she let him kiss her again . He found her warmer , he held her with bolder passion ; he thought , perhaps I need n't be so cautious ; he drew her slowly towards the divan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips in her hair . " Do you want to ? Vuoi , cara , vuoi ? " She drew away suddenly and looked at him , startling him with the cool , musing expression of her eyes . My God , he thought , am I mistaken , is she cold , has n't she felt anything , is it really as I have heard about such women ? He was a little angry ; she saw the thrust of his heavy lower lip , a movement of his brows which could have told her , had she known him well , that he had no patience with teasing women and would be furious at his own stupidity should he have blundered into this position with one of them . But she said , still with the meditative look in56 57MARCIA DAVENPORTher eyes , " I think  --  yes . But not today . " He was mollified , but puzzled . She saw it . She said , " Do you mind very much , Carlo ? I should like to give you pleasure , I want to , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " He held her tightly , gripping her shoulders . " That you , that I , that  --  " She smiled . " I simply have a feeling of wanting time to decide something . " " But if you intend anyway to consent  --  " " It is n't that . It 's better not to talk it all to tatters . Will you let it go until  --  " " Until you return from Rome ? Is that what you mean ? When will you be back ? " ' He had not freed her from his arms . " Oh , early next week . But you 'll be in Cortina . So perhaps , later on  --  " " But no more playing with me , " he said , frowning . " Yes or no  --  " No more of my American misgivings , is what he means . UnlessI can carry this off like any woman here and keep confusion out of it , he does n't want a problem . He is right . She rememberedagain Pina 's smooth grace at luncheon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will make me feel a fool , she thought , looking at his face , to be treated like the other women he has made love to . But I am not going to be provincial and let it discomfit me . " My God , " he said , " is this the sort of moment when you always do your serious thinking ? " She wound her arms round his neck . " Always , " she said , while he kissed her eyelids , the tips of her ears , the end of her nose , the angle of her chin . He found her literally delicious and he considered her hesitation and dilatoriness the sheerest nonTHECONSTANT IMAGEsense . It can just as well be now , he decided , and again tried to make the point conclusive . But she said , " No , please , Carlo  --  but I do like you very much . " He knew quite well that if she were not so appetizing and a novelty he would not bother with her further . And of course , he told himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ *HARRIET returned from Rome on the rapido which arrived in Milano on Tuesday evening . She was very pleased to come back . She took almost a perverse pleasure in the keenness of her preference for Milano over Rome . She could not isolate every element of this preference , but much of it was the knowledge that a certainruggedness of mind , the faculty to savour the pleasing and the beautiful amidst a mixture of contrasts including the prosaic , the ugly , and the contemporary , were forms of originality , which she liked . Rome presented its pleasures and splendours in such consistent grandeur that , once past the status of reverent tourist , which of course she had once been , one must be wholly a specialist to support so much magnificence , history , panoply , society , even so much blazing sun and turquoise sky . She was neither scholar , historian , artist , nor participant in the convolving spheres of the double corps and the grandest , most anachronistic nobility on earth . To be a functioning member of any of this would make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without , like some dallying or expatriate people she knew , was meaningless . And the tourist 's Rome she loathed . Whereas her stay in Milano , unrelated though it was to whatever she conceived as her real place in the world , and this was a time of dubiety about that , THE CONSTANT IMAGEwas linked for the moment to the real lives of real people . Only a transient satisfaction , she reflected , and nothing to tie up to at all ; but it is better than racketing about like the people I have just seen in Rome . A train was quite a novelty to her , for she was accustomed to flying long distances and herself driving shorter ones . Both were ruled out here at this time of year unless one were prepared to be grounded , delayed , or faced with mortal danger . She settled down in her comfortable seat in the new lightweight railway carriage , which in its open plan and abundance of aluminum fittings and plate glass seemed like the offspring of a venturesome motor bus and an absent-minded airplane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and now she missed the cosy red-plush privacy of the classic compartment . She was disappointed when the guard told her that the train carried no dining-car ; luncheon was served at one 's seat , as in a plane . What a bore she would find that , expecting a slithering plastic tray dotted with dishes and cups of tepid , tired food . Her seat companion was a well-dressed , heavy-set man who carried a thick brief-case ; when he had put his hat and overcoat in the rack , he bowed to her , sat down , and immediately immersed himself in the work he had brought with him . But Harriet was aware that he took occasion at intervals to glance her way . It occurred to her that this new sort of train might be regarded by a certain kind of man with considerable disaffection , it was so public ; and she smothered a small laugh , opening the novel she had bought in the station in Rome . Not that this man looked like the sort of bore who scraped unwelcome acquaintance ; he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all probabilityhe was a friend of Sandro Marchisi and of Carlo and of people they knew . MARCIA DAVENPORTHarriet had spent the past days traversing the arc of a resolutionnot to think about Carlo Dalverio , as the best way to approachthe imminent moment for which she could not find a more accurate term than point of no return . She feared the workings of her hitherto romantic imagination should she allow herself to dwell upon him . She had never put this imagination to the test of reality as it was understood here ; she had no doubts about the views of these people , but many doubts of herself and of the consequences of any misstep that she might take . To go forward with this adventure would be to commit herself to a course of dissemblance , with all its pitfalls , which she had never before attempted ; and to retreat would mean such discomfiture on meeting him inevitably in the circle of his friends that she would almost prefer to escape that by leaving Milano ; a pity , and something she did not want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the childish device of shutting her mind to every aspect of the question except the ultimate one of asking herself whom she supposed she was fooling . When the train had left Florence a white-jacketed waiter sped the length of the car , fixing a firm table to the arms of each passenger 's seat . The man beside Harriet put his papers away and relaxed with a smile in anticipation of his lunch . The first waiter was followed by a second man with linen , silver , glass , and blue Wagons-Lits plates , with which he deftly set each person'splace . Aperitivi appeared and Harriet took some Carpano ; so did the man beside her . He smiled again and wished her good appetite . She returned the greeting . The wine man came along and she bought a quarter-litre of Chianti Antinori ; her neighbour chose the same . The first waiter reappeared , with a great steamingbowl , swiftly ladling portions of rigatoni onto the passengers ' plates . Harriet enjoyed watching the man work , his perfectTHE CONSTANT IMAGEbalance in the swaying train , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , the bowl in his left . The food was plain , robust , and delicious ; the rigatoni were boiling hot , mixed with an excellent salsa bolognese and plenty of cheese . When half the passengers were served the waiter rushed away to fetch a fresh hot bowl for the rest . Harriet marvelled , and said so . Her companion nodded ; yes , it was surprising what good , hot food could be served in this new way , but of course the public would stand for nothing less ; one paid a premium fare for the rapido and there could be no nonsense . " But the labour ! " said Harriet . The man shrugged . From his view , she saw , it was preposterousthat such labour should not be taken for granted , both in available numbers and in willingness to work for the prevailing wage . Railway workers , like civil servants , bus drivers , and many others , were always going out on one-day strikes and it was a damnable nuisance ; they should be grateful for their jobs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself . This was the under side of the soft-surfaced carpet which was the part of Italian life that she knew ; but while serious contemplation of social problemshad never occupied her , she was not a fool . Reality in her orbit at home was high taxes and few , if any , servants ; among her friends here , the opposite . Oh , they grumbled and worried : taxes were heavier and stricter now , the women complained about the servants and the men about the workmen in their factories , but one could not be oblivious to brutal truths pressing in their enormous preponderance . They were part of the same image as the one she had had last week when envisioning the people 's homes ; the Italy of the novel she was reading , the Italy about which most of its writers wrote , the Italy of hunger , 62 63MARCIA DAVENPORTmisery , despair , and their spawn . When she read such a book it lowered her momentarily into a crypt of gloomy and uneasy thought , from which she was most likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some cheerful , skilful soul like the waiter who was now serving her from a platter of filet steaks with their garnish of fresh vegetables . " But this is such a lot ! " she told the man . " Oh , no , Signora , I chose the nicest filetto for you , one must eat well on a cold day . " He hurried on , doing his work as most of them did , with gusto . They liked to work , they had their faults , but their vigour and their quickness and their physical agility were a delight to see . She loved to watch them talk , nothing in the world could be so expressive as the least flick of an Italian 's fingers . There was a certain circular motion , done with the relaxed hand on a loose wrist , accompanied by raised eyebrows and a judicious pursing of the mouth , which meant half a dozen different things and entertained her vastly . The man beside her had been eyeing her book . Presently , as they were eating cheese and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may I ask your impression of that book ? " " I have only read a little of it , " she replied . " I had been told it was remarkable and I suppose it is , in its vividness . The dialogueis brilliant . " " And the subject ? " " Disagreeable , " she said . " Have you read it ? " He shook his head . " Not even if I had the time . Any workmanin one of my factories could write better about what Italian life is like today . " She realized who the man was , a textile magnate of enormouswealth , whose name was known everywhere . He had been THE CONSTANT IMAGEpointed out to her . He said , " You must be the American lady who is the friend of the Marchisi ? " " Milano is really not so small as that ! " " Just small enough . And you speak Italian so well . " " Thank you , but of course I do n't . I make mistakes and I do n't let it bother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Many of us took pleasure in admiring you and your equally beautiful compatriot last Tuesday . " " Lydia is extraordinary , is n't she . Especially when so many of her friends here are really great beauties . I 've never seen such a spectacle as the women at La Scala that evening . The clothes ! The jewels ! The furs ! " " But in America that would be outdone as a matter of course ? " " You 've been there , surely . Have you ever seen an American gathering so elegant and  --  frankly  --  one that was such a display of wealth ? " He smiled as if to conceal some secret . " Perhaps not . But our women are much less intelligent than yours ; they think about nothing else . " " Their families . . . " A gesture said that this was not worth pointing out . " Their heads are perfectly empty , " he said . " They are silly , they are vain , they are lazy , they cost a shocking amount of money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say . " And ? " " We love it ! " He spoke with the utmost gusto . Harriet could not think of another reply , so she said , " You have given me quite a perspective from which to go on reading this book . " From time to time she looked at the window as they wereMARCIA DAVENPORTcovering the last stretch after Piacenza . The fog was a solid wall , but the train was still skimming the rails like a glider . The newspapersrecently had carried accounts of several hideous disasters in the fog at level crossings . If one dwelt on this one would be beside oneself at this point in the journey , but nobody was . A few of the passengers were asleep or idly smoking or reading popular magazines , but most of them were like Harriet 's neighbour , busy men who had brought masses of work along and who only began to put it away when they looked at their watches as they felt the train slow down for the approach to the Milano station . The textile gentleman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held it for her . It was a very good fur coat , as good as New York provided , and when she thanked him she slowly winked one eye . He laughed . She approved his not offering to help her as she handed her luggage checks to a porter on the platform ; they bowed and he hurried away . Carlo Dalverio was on the verge of changing his mind . This was not an unfamiliar thing , it had happened before . It was closely linked to his mood , to his whereabouts , and to the state of his relations with Pina . He was fond of her and proud of her always , but she came nearest to holding him completely when they were off with the children on holidays like this . He basked in the warmth of the children 's happiness , of Pina 's approval , and of the wellbeing wrought by this kind of life . They were lucky with the weather ; the sky was blue , the snow packed and crisp , the slopes and slides and rinks in perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day 's sport with fresl intensity . Each moment was filled ; the children had lessons witl champion skaters and skimasters , later Carlo came down fron the big slopes and took out Tonino and his cousin Coco for the last hour of the morning , while the little girls went to the children'spractise slopes . Pina did not ski but she enjoyed this life many of her friends were here with their families and those whc were not sportswomen were pleasurably occupied with chic . with canasta and bridge and gabble . At lunchtime , ravenous and tanned , they gathered round the big table in the sunny window overlooking the skating rink , to eat an enormous meal in a chorus of ski-talk and plans for the afternoon , for tomorrow , for next day , even for next year , since the children were begging him to build a house up here like many people they knew , and he was seriously considering it Pina remarked with a shade of doubt that perhaps they had enough houses already , what with Santa Margherita and Caldagnaand Guello , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although they never went there , but Carlo brushed that aside . All houses were desirable investments ; the only question was whether they would more enjoy a chalet-villa of their own or this life at the Cristallo . Then there was the afternoon nap , deliciously welcome , with Pina drowsing in his arms as he had drawn her from her bed close by his , replete with lovemakingand warm under the eiderdown . He lay in the dim room , drifting on the brink of sleep , with his wife 's head pillowed on his shoulder , and vaguely he asked himself why this was not always as much as he could want . He had everything in her excepthigh romance , variety , and excitement ; was n't he reaching an age where they should matter little anyway , and were they worth the trouble ? He did not pursue the question to its conclusionbecause he knew the answer very well . He was not ready to66 67MARCIA DAVENPORTchange , and age had nothing to do with it . So long as he kept a sense that life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long would he be as he was ; but at this particular time he could wish this were not so . He experimented with drawing a mental image of the American who had intrigued him , and he took some satisfaction in finding that for the moment the image had diminished in its appeal . There would be passing constraint if he should delicately drop his pursuit of her , but he was skilled in these matters and he would manage it in such a way that there would be no slight to her beauty or her confidence . She was bound to have a lover soon , and shortly she would again be meeting the Dalveri , laughing and talking with him quite naturally and priding herself on her quick understanding that some unusual development between himself and Pina had made his withdrawal necessary . It was all quite simple . It was also a lot of nonsense . All these thoughts were prompted by the fact that he was comfortable and content , enjoyinghimself , and at the moment without need for the diversionswhich spiced the routine of life at home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Milano his present notion would appear in its true light , preposterous . He wanted very much to complete his conquest of Harriet Piers but the truth was that he did not want to have to leave Cortina to do so . It could wait . She had certainly not been impatient , if she was really interested at all . You imbecile , he reviled himself , silently striking his forehead with his clenched fist ; you cretin , you giraffe ! Why did you tell Rinaldo to get you out of here on Thursday ? His usual impatience , he sighed ; was n't he old enough to have learnt not to spring at things on impulse ? Well , he would send Ortolani aTHE CONSTANT IMAGElampo as soon as he got downstairs ; he would not interrupt his holiday , and next week would take care of itself . Tenderly he drew Pina to him and caressed her , which she received with a contented murmur ; and in a few minutes he was sound asleep . Oh , thought Harriet , as Carlo walked in on Monday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word for it . It has nothing to do with anything else , he is simply beautiful , like a cheetah or a panther . His skin had the ruddy bronze tint laid on by winter sun and wind and cold , he strode in as if on a sweep of mountain air , he moved with the grace of the feline animal he brought to mind , wearing his brilliant , delighted smile . He was perfectly confident of his attractiveness and perfectly aware how his skiing holiday had enhanced it . He crossed the room in a couple of strides and took her in his arms . " At last ! " he exclaimed , and his embrace was entrancing , his face still cold from the winter air , his mouth warm and urgent . His kiss lingered until she was out of breath . Finally they drew apart and he looked into her eyes and said , " I think you are glad to see me ! " " I think I am . " " Did you miss me ? " He did not let her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ softly , lightly , quickly . " Tell me . Did you miss me ? " She made a mocking face . " Not a bit more than you missed me . I had fun too ! " " You did ! " His voice was sharp . He drew her to an arm-68 69MARCIA DAVENPORT chair and sat down in it , holding her so that she dropped into his lap . " What did you do ? With whom ? When ? In Rome ? Whom did you see there ? Whom have you seen here ? Where ? " He stopped her peals of laughter with another long kiss , to which she responded so warmly that he sat up suddenly , took her hands in his , scowled , and said , " Answer all those questions . Whom did you take for a lover ? " " No , Carlo . I am not going to answer any question I do n't want to answer , and I must say you 're taking a lot for granted by the way you ask them . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curious plangent undertone in his voice . " Look at me , cara , look straight at me because I want to enjoy your eyes . Open them wide . Very wide . " He brushed the dark thick lashes with his lips . " Nov smile , the funny smile which makes them close up . Now close them . " He kissed the lids , pausing to look down at them and wait until they opened slowly and the wide , pale grey eyes were again looking into his . " What did you really do ? " he whispered , his hands moving softly . " You telephoned . You know . Do n't tell me all that scream- ing was for nothing ! Why are your telephone connections so frightful here ? " " The war , " he said from force of habit ; it had been said for nearly fifteen years . " But I have n't called since Friday . " " And I 'm not accounting for Saturday and Sunday . Kiss me . " " With joy ! " They were silent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " And thank you for all the lovely roses . " She moved her hand from his embrace and waved at the fresh ones which had come today . " Cara , " he said , in a breathless voice , and asked a question 70 to which she replied by burying her face in his chest . He stood up , holding her in his arms , walked over to the divan , and laid her down on it . He glanced over his shoulder at the closed door of the room , and she murmured , " She is out , I sent her on an errand . " He made an exclamation of delight and sank down beside her . She had not dreamt , she had never had an intimation in her life before , that there could be pleasure so exquisite , perfected sensitive , so veiled in tenderness , so bold in understanding , attuned like the finest vibration of a precision instrument to every shade of her sensibility . She was amazed , and after a long time , she said so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " How can one have pleasure if one does not aim first of all to give it ? And you are wonderful , wonderful  --  " He broke off , as if choked by emotion ; he did not want her to suspect that he in turn was surprised , why had he supposed that her fresh and girlish person , her light , firm body without a particle of needless flesh , would be less voluptuous than the ripeness that was more usual here ? " Wonderful , " he said again , " and how I like you ! " " I like you , " she said , touching the fine , flat plane of his cheek . " I like to say these things as you do . " " Ah , it would be impossible in your language . Even youyou  --  " he gripped her shoulders and told her with his eyes that the past half hour could be repeated now , this instant , but for the little clock ticking there across the room . " Even you could not make love in English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " As we have ? As we shall ? " She shook her head . She was aware that she had had the merest foretaste of sublimity. 71  --   --  6  --   --  *A DESIGN of ways and means had to be drawn , overriding her distaste , which she had to conceal like other evidences of her inexperience , for scheming , contriving , lies , duplicity , hiding . Though Carlo groaned how tiresome he found all this , Harriet saw that it was part and parcel of his habit , the spur of danger and excitement without which he could not ride the horse of everyday existence . He was a master at this feat of equestrianism . It was scarcely necessary for him to point out , with the realism which had always swept him over the shoals of recklessness , that if he and she were not lovers each would be involved with somebody else . " And each would have all the same problems , " he said , " but none of the same rewards . Because this is not to be had just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groped for a simile . " Like the finest possible musical instrument , the finest violin Stradivari ever made  --  " His graceful , graphic brown hand caressed her throat. "  --  which is only wood and catgut until a virtuoso plays it , " she said . " Cara ! " He was delighted . " But which virtuoso ? " he added , sharply . There was that stubborn lower lip , pouting . " The greatest , according to your preference . " THE CONSTANT IMAGE " But which ? " " Do you really suspect me of having had a violinist for a lover ? You are incorrigible . I will never name any name to you , for any reason . Never . " He laughed . And she thought she was doing well not to let him discover how very few men there had been in her past . She was not sure why she felt this , but it was also the reason why her only break , prompted by rage and jealousy , from the bounds of her disordered marriage , had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had shied away from commitment even to sheer adventure . A man like Carlo Dalverio either would not believe this or could not understand it ; he would think her childish or priggish . She could not risk that , remembering a time not vastly long ago when it had been true . She could not help knowing what Italians usually thought about American women in her situation and , again , she wanted to take care not to be so jejune as to argue it with or without words . She was fastidious ; and in Carlo Dalverio she had a man who so exceeded the extremest qualifications for pleasing her that any experienced woman would tell her it was essential he not find this out . She checked her words , her glances , her acts , even her posture , at moments when her forthright character urged her to be herself , and her clever , adaptable mind counselled otherwise . This was the preceptorwhich told her to keep her touch light , her wits sharp , her perceptions lightning-quick . It was less difficult than she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even in the presence of Pina , because he spoke only English with her at such times , just as he had from the first . Sometimes when she was speaking Italianwith other people he would turn and compliment her gravely on her progress , which put her under a special challenge to keepMARCIA DAVENPORTthe least glint from her eye , the flicker of a telltale expression from her lips . She hoped ; but of course she could not be sure . Carlo told her frankly that he assumed Pina knew , because Pina almost always knew ; but if we do no stupidities , he said , and she is never allowed to feel that she is not in command of the situation , there will be peace . " And , " asked Harriet uneasily and with diffidence , " has there ever  --  ever not been peace ? " " I am afraid so , cara . Pina is jealous  --  " " I knew that within a week of meeting her . " " And me . " " And you . " " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is life , there is nothing we can do about it , I am as I am . Some day I shall be too old or too feeble or even too indifferent to want pleasure any more . " " I ca n't imagine it . " " Eh , be ' . But it must happen , like everything else . That will be when Pina has me all to herself and that is what Pina lives for . That , and the children . " " I 'd never have the patience . Or the discipline . " " You also have not kept your husband , cara . This is not to blame you , " he added quickly , with an apologetic smile . " It is only to explain women like Pina . I suppose they exist in all countriesbut I do not know other countries well and I do know my own . I know how much Pina will stand and how much she will not . I know when I hurt her and I am sad that I hurt her , but as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as Pina knows the ground is solid beneath her feet she will be , she will act , as she does now . " " I could n't do it ! " Harriet felt a wave of intense admirationTHE CONSTANT IMAGEfor Pina . " I think she 's magnificent . " Prodded by the humiliating memory of her own behaviour in the same circumstances , she spoke with spontaneous sincerity ; then she saw that quite withoutdesign , she had pleased him very much by saying what she had . " Well , she is , " he agreed . " And even though you are more beautiful and interesting and novel than  --  " he hesitated . " Than others that there have been ? " she prompted softly . He nodded , with a helpless little laugh . " Clever also . Ah , you please me so much ! " He swooped down and pinned her with a long kiss . " Come , come , " she said sidling away . " Finish what you were saying . " " I do n't remember , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drew the kind of imperceptible extra breath which enables one to carry off a phrase one is not too sure about  --  " and my predecessors , shall we say ? " " I am not enjoying this conversation any more , " he said , reaching to draw her towards him . " But finish it . " He shrugged . " However greater your charms may be , and Pina can see what they are , you are foreign , you belong elsewhere , you will eventually go home , and for this reason Pina can be more patient about you than she might be , and than she has been , about others . Now have I talked enough ? " and he seized her with the mock roughness which set her blood and bones tingling , and coolly drew the zipper down the long back of her dress . " There , " he said , pushing the dress from her shoulders and tracing their delicate curves of bone and muscle and fragrant skin with his lips , " that is better than silly talk . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of discovery , telling her , 74 75MARCIA DAVENPORTin quick , excited words , new , secret , playful words , about the treasures he was uncovering , and asking her to rejoice with him because they were so marvellous . So among other people , Carlo speaking English , quickly became a person different from Carlo in whose arms she lay , looking up at a face illuminated with sensual delight , and communicativeas no face she could ever have imagined . To respond to this , to be led into realms unknown before , to hear what he said in this lovely language of words spoken and rapture unspoken , to be taught to answer in every sound and every sense was more than she had ever had or hoped for . And still she did not know him very well . Every morning he telephoned , to talk so long that she wondered at the methods of Italian business , imagining him to be fending off a troop of associates , secretaries , and busy men arriving for appointments , all cooling their heels in anterooms . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been established years ago to make breathing-spaces for the arrangements of his private life between the great major fixtures of his family and his work . He had energy and to spare for all of them , and enthusiasm too ; he neglected nothing ; but time and the opportunity !  --  that had always been the problem . He had solved it in his own way and Harriet , studying the lesson of feminine resemblance to the ostrich , warily learned to disregard the part played in his life by what she herself had called her predecessors . It was best to keep her head in the sand , a tactic proved by his way of teasing , accusing , probing the crannies of her past and even of the present , for each day he demanded to know whom she had seen since he had last seen her , and whom she was to see before they met again . She parried this and played his game of darts with increasingskill , and kept him inquisitive and amused ; but sheTHE CONSTANT IMAGEsensed that the least backthrust from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whereabouts and his doings present or past would be rebuffed with coldness if not with sullenness . Sometimes she felt quite exhausted by her constant , watchful effort and sometimes she wondered why she was making it . Italian women and other foreign women did all this with ease and bravura , for its own sake ; many Americans did , but she had never been one of them . Now she was committed to play on a scene where failure or defeat would be too ignominious to endure , and she found herself in the arena encumbered by a sackful of instincts and habits , the American amalgam of romanticism , materialism , and prudery which demanded that a love-affair prove something , be something more than a special type of friendship and a glorious physical experience . Or , if it made no claims to anything higher , it was defined by a series of slang phrases , flippant or smutty , which outraged her . These she had always angrily rejected , in mind as well as in fact . Her inner self was not so cool , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , upon which she thought she could rely anywhere . She still had to fight down the impulse to demand that men and life be as she wanted them . But she also perceived that if she wanted Carlo Dalverio at all , she would have to do as other women had done who had won him for varying lengths of time on his terms and his alone . The great factor on which her fate would hang was the injunctionnot to fall in love with Carlo Dalverio , not to be in love with him any more than he was with her . She had never attempted this ; she had practised what she had heard derided as the American infantilism of refusing to make love without being in love or believing oneself to be . Now it was all to be different , and if she did not learn to measure the difference and act ac-76 77MARCIA DAVENPORT cordingly , she would not only drive him away but she would make a fool of herself . She had noticed in a very short time that all the verbal wealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with delight , was devoid of reference to the emotion of love . This was a strange discovery in a country where the word amore was probably pronounced oftener than its equiva- lent anywhere else . Italy throbbed with song , from its temples of music to its back alleys and juke-boxes , and amore was the bur- den of these hundreds of thousands of arias and songs . Some- times , putting her hands to her head in sheer bewilderment , she wanted to ask what it all meant , but she was astute enough to suspect she would be better off not to find out . One morning in the middle of January Harriet and Lydia Marchisi went to try on some hats that they had ordered . Lydia 's milliner , who had a salon in the Montenapoleone , was a hand- some , smiling , hard-working woman with the efficiency and sure hand of lifetime saturation in her metier . She went fre- quently to Paris to bring back the choicest models from the great designers , and her copies were better in materials and workman- ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own originations in a type of wildly flattering small hat , usually made of feathers , designed to be worn in the boxes at La Scala on the evenings when one dressed only a little , in contrast to occasions of grand gala . A superb , slightly mad , short black dress was then in order , worn with one of these wicked hats and long antelope gloves of a shade to match it . The whole scheme enchanted Har- riet , it was so altogether a Milanese specialty . In New York if one should dress like this it would be to dine in a restaurant which would exactly resemble any good restaurant in any metropolisin the world . Most such cities also had their opera houses , but only Milano had La Scala , generative of a whole way of life with its unlikely combination of casual intimacy and grandeur , its argot and its conventions , its moulding of taste in matters ranging from great art to fripperies like these hats which the two women greeted with exclamations of pleasure . The modiste and the vendeuses hurried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course there were more models newly arrived to be brought out for trial and discussion . Hats were Harriet 's foible because she wore them well and it amused her to cultivate them when many women of her age went bareheaded . But she said , " This has got to stop somewhere , Signora Ricci , it really does , I 've never been here that I did n't buy something I never intended to . " " But with the Signora 's beauty and chic  --  " " Do n't stoop to that , " said Harriet , laughing . " The trouble is your hats . You do n't have to flatter anybody to sell them . Let me see that cloche over there , " she said to a girl , " the poisongreenone  --  " " Oh no , " said Lydia , " that colour  --  " " We can make it in any colour , Signora , I 've just done it for  --  ah , buon giorno , Signora ! " and Pina Dalverio walked in . She greeted everybody with a calm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , what have you been choosing ? " " I was just about to show the ladies your new cloche I 've finished . " A girl came from the workroom with it . Pina sat down and they fitted it to her shining nut-coloured hair . In a coppery shade of brown the hat was perfect on her , she was oneoMARCIA DAVENPORTof the extremely few women who could wear brown well and give it high style . Harriet watched her studying the hat from every angle , watched her smooth , imperturbable features , the deliberate movements of her beautiful hands . How sure of herselfshe is , she thought , how perfectly she carries this off ; my God ! if only I did n't crumple inside at the sight of her . I hate it , I feel like a worm . Lydia and Pina were chatting , absorbed in the hats , and Lydia 's expression in its way was also a study , a wide , photographic smile turned on nobody in particular . It felt to Harriet like a bright curtain drawn across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and give her time to rally a degree of poise and grace equal to Pina 's . She had seen Pina several times in the past ten days , in the same pattern as before ; for some reason she had felt surer of herself with time to prepare for those meetings . This was their first chance encounter and she was distressed to find it much more awkward . She would have thought it easier to see Pina without Carlo present , but she found to her astonishment that she was wrong . And to Lydia , for all their intimacy , she had not said a word confirming the faitaccomplibetween herself and Carlo . Lydia must have sensed that matters were as they were , which in one way was a reassuranceto Harriet , but in another might mean that if Pina and Lydia already knew this , many others might or presently would , in exactly the same way . Harriet was putting her hair in order and Pina Dalverio , finished with her fitting , came over and said , " I 'm glad I 've found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . " " At my Italian lesson , " said Harriet . She wondered if Pina had also telephoned during the long time when the line had been tied up by Carlo . " I wanted to ask you to join us on Wednesday evening . It 's Tosco and a friend of Carlo 's will be here , an Englishman . " THE CONSTANT IMAGE " Why , I should love it . Thank you so much . " Harriet smiled gaily . " That will be a help , " said Pina , with a self-deprecating shrug . " You know how little English I speak and I never want this man to be bored . Carlo is very fond of him , he knew him in the war . " The war , thought Hrriet , how extraordinary . I ca n't imagine Carlo in a war , or any of these people . Yet there could not be one of them who had not been through everything ; Sandro and Carlo and all their friends were about the same age , and nobody ever mentioned the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak her beautiful French with the Englishman , which she must often have done if he was such a good friend of Carlo 's . Then it occurred to her that if the man had been through the war here he must speak Italian , probably better than Harriet herself ; why had Pina put this on the footing of Harriet 's doing her a favour ? This invitation and other recent ones now appeared to Harriet to be devices manipulated by Pina as parts of a panel of instruments for measuring the exact state of the situation and keeping the controls in her own hands . Or , she reflected , as they all rose to go , drawing on their gloves and moving to the door in a chorus of smiling good-days from the milliner and her staff , is Pina pursuing the tactic of inviting me often , hoping that she is ramming me down Carlo 's throat and betting he will soon be tired of me ? A quick flash of pride rose within her , she hoped not to her face where it might betray her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but she was trapped now . The easy sociabilityof a few weeks ago seemed a long way off , and she looked back upon it wistfully . In Lydia 's car they sat silent for a time . Harriet watched the people streaming into the streets from every shop and office , 80 81MARCIA DAVENPORTamidst a cacophony of descending iron shutters . It was just twelve-thirty and they were all hurrying home to their midday dinners . They crammed the greenish-blue trams and buses so tightly that one gasped to see them leaping to footholds where one would have said there was not space for a fly . Lydia 's chauffeurwas stuck in the traffic behind a filobus , where a group of young men packed in the rear were looking out at the glittering Flaminia with the two beautiful women in it ; from their smiles and their gestures of heads and hands it was too easy to imagine their remarks about the car and its occupants . Harriet could not help laughing . " How they do enjoy everything ! " she exclaimed . " Can you imagine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to face four times a day ? " Lydia shrugged . " They 're so tough and energetic and gregariousit does n't occur to them it 's a hardship . They all want a Vespa or a Seicento , but not to be by themselves ; for sport . And they 're getting them , too , more every year . You 've seen the road along the lake , and heard it , every Sunday . That 's why I like it best in winter . " " Will you be going this week end , darling ? " " I think so . The children love it and Sandro 's such an angel he indulges my whims . Actually , he likes it himself now he 's got the habit . Everybody we know thinks I 'm mad to keep that house open all year round . They ca n't understand our week ends , they say the lake is triste ' in winter , when that 's apt to be the best time of all . They say it 's the only American taste I 've kept . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . " I 've been wanting to tell you , darling . . . any time it might help you to say you 're there with us , say it . " " Oh , Lydia  --  ! " " And also  --  you wo n't think I 'm prying ? " THE CONSTANT IMAGE " Darling ! " " If you should want to go there  --  you know , by yourself  --  it 's always possible . " " You are too wonderful , " said Harriet softly . " No . But you have to be . " " You were , just now , with Pina . " " I am really fond of Pina , we 've been very good friends for ten years . " " And yet you 've just said  --  " " What am I to do ? " Lydia 's blue eyes were troubled . " Some aspects of this could be painful . I ca n't help Carlino 's being as he is and it 's none of my business what he does or with whom  --  until that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I are like sisters , but what that means in this case is that I 'll have to do what I can to protect everybody . " Harriet grasped her hand with a quick surge of love . " Thank God you 're here , " she breathed. "  --  just so everybody behaves , " murmured Lydia . She looked hard at Harriet . " You 're not going to get in deep , darling ? Promiseme you wo n't get hurt . " " No . My eyes are wide open  --  to here . " She stretched them as far as she could . " I have n't asked you how you 're feeling . " " Oh , fine . I 'm past the icky stage already and ravenous all the time . I 'm dying this minute , " she said as the car arrived at her house , " and we 're going to have tortellini in pasticcio for lunch ! " In the afternoon Harriet left Lydia 's house on foot , planning to do several errands on her way home . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of streets threaded between and behind the main arteries , and she enjoyed walking all over the fan-shaped northeastern quarter of Milano , whose82 83MARCIA DAVENPORTbase was the Duomo and whose two outer corners the Brera and the Conservatorio . In this area nearly everybody lived whom she knew , and every shop and place of business was situated to which she was likely to go . Everything was stirred together in an agreeable jumble of houses great and small , palazzi old and new , where no zoning laws existed and no distinction was made betweenresidential and commercial tenants and property . It had been startling at first to find that some people she met lived at the same address as the man 's place of business , which usually meant that he or his company owned a palazzo with offices on the lower floors and a magnificent penthouse apartment on the upper ones . New York had no exclusive claim to penthouse life and its accoutrements ; one needed only to be high enough to look out and see how prettily the Milanesi did themselves , how many charming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planting , and furnished with the kind of imaginative nonsense at which they excelled . Even the vile winter weather was no discouragement because of the lovely long autumn and spring unknown in the United States . It was a good life , Harriet reflected ; a very good life  --  for the rich , whether they lived in mellow beauty and state like the Ortolani , in old-fashioned luxury like the Dalveri , or in the smart style and spirit of the remarkable skyscrapers which had sprung up since the last war . She reached home at the end of the day , tired enough not to feel very sanguine in mood . On the way up in the lift she recalled a similar evening not so long ago when she had also had no plans and had been glad of it . Today she was at some pains to hide from herself what she was really feeling : that an evening like this was good only in proportion to one 's own resources of mind and taste , but even more , to the natural relationships which gave reason to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CONSTANT IMAGEshe was without . Even when she was married to Norton Piers the idea of an evening quietly at home had been almost absurd ; he proposed a restaurant , a play , a film , a hockey game , anything rather than repose and tranquil companionship , of which he was incapable . But Harriet believed that she was capable of it now and would like it and make something treasurable of it . The corollary , then , was the uneasy question which some other woman might not ask herself : where was Carlo Dalverio leading her , where other than to a dead end ? This was a passage of her life when she should be assembling the materials for a permanent dwelling-place ; not such a jerrybuilt pleasure-dome as her mother expected of her , but a real house to live in , with thick walls and a leakproof roof , and a cellar and an attic to hold the leisurely accumulation of memory and sentiment and shared experiencesgood and bad which gave full dimensions to other people 's lives when her own , especially at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper . She opened the door of her flat , saying , " Angela ? " and pausingfor the maid to come and take her coat . But Angela for some reason had not heard . Harriet dropped the coat on a chair with her purse and gloves and picked up the letters that had come , looking through them as she went to the sitting-room . The curtainswere drawn , the lamps lighted , the little glass cart with ice and bottles ready in its corner . And near it , comfortably settled on the divan with a cigarette and a drink , reading an American picture magazine , was Carlo . Harriet stood open-mouthed , decidinghow to respond to this . The thing not to show was the spark of delight which touched her when she saw him . He pretended to ignore her for a time , then he put down the magazine and sat shaking with laughter , holding out his arms . " But how did you get here ? " she asked . " You did n't say  --  " 84 8SMARCIA DAVENPORT " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be out until about now . So I told her I 'd be along and she was expecting me . " " She  --  ! " " Our servants have hospitable ways . When a person has been received before they assume he is welcome . " " Oh . And I suppose she gave you coffee ? " " Naturally she did . Then when I learned you would be here alone for the evening , I told her to run along . " " Carlo ! You what ? " He had pulled her down beside him and was busy revisiting his favourite nooks and corners about her head and throat and breast ; he lifted his face from hers and said , " I told her to go to the cinema , she was happy as a lark . " " And gave her money , of course  --  " " The poor girl ! But her gentleman friend , what is this subtle term for it they have in your country ? Her friend is the cameriere of the Longoni downstairs and as they are away at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " But Carlo  --  " " But cara . You are going to fuss because of what you think she will think , and though centuries roll and you pretend people are not as they are , she will think what all reasonable adults think and if you continue to be kind and generous with her , may I ask what you have to fear ? " " But servants talk . " " Of course they talk . Do n't you ? Do n't I ? If they were deaf , dumb and blind they would still be perfectly aware of everythingtheir employers do , and if it were otherwise  --  come , this is ridiculous . Come to bed . " THE CONSTANT IMAGE " Well , " said Harriet slowly , " now that the opportunity presentsitself  --  " " Itself '  --  ! I created it , I alone with a stroke of genius . Come , we have several hours and I have seized them by the throat . " " Hours ! " Harriet felt a surge of pleasure . " Pina is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off to take a man from Stuttgart to dinner who is here on business . I must say he is the most appetizing , fragrant , irresistible , the loveliest  --  Ah ! you are wonderful , you have the body of a girl and the eyes of a sphinx . " " I wish they were , " she murmured , as they moved towards her bedroom , their arms about each other . " I wish I had such wisdom . " " Be wise later , be wise some other time , " he said . " Hurry . Let me help you . " His fine , muscular brown hands were as agile , as skilled  --  she felt with fleeting revulsion  --  as a good maid 's ; he is too experienced ; but she was lost at once in the splendours roused by his own physical beauty , his marvellous whole-hearted eagerness which swept thought and second thought into lucent space , where flames soared and a vast orchestra thundered . But the flames did not burn and the sounds did not deafen ; they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was too moved to remember to pretend insouciance . He lay with his head on her breast , murmuring , " My God , my God , you are miraculous , it is too beautiful to be true ! " Once again she blessed his exquisitelanguage which had a phrase and a nuance for every part and every echo of this experience ; it released her from the constraintwhose shackles she now knew she had always worn before . Suddenly he gripped her shoulders hard , raising himself on one elbow and looking into her face . " Tell me , " he said , " tell me . Why are you so extraordinary , what is your secret ? " 86 87MARCIA DAVENPORTShe turned her head to escape his eyes and murmured , " It might be my teacher . " He gave a great cry and in a little while swept her away again . They slept and when they stirred , smiling , to think about the time and let it bring them back to reality they saw that it was almost nine o'clock . " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very hungry and here we are , faced with things as they have to be . It would be so pleasant to go and have something to eat . " " We can go right into my kitchen and have something , since you have taken care of Angela 's evening . I can cook eggs . " " Suppose you go and look into the question , " he said . She put on a negligee , arranged her hair and face , and left him to dress . As she turned on the lights in the kitchen she stood and stared . A large tray had been set out on the table , ready to be carried wherever it was wanted , with everything laid for supper for two . On platters and dishes were an assortment of raw and cooked ham , various sausages , pieces of devilled chicken , lobster in aspic , a paglierina cheese , and a small bloc of foie gras . There was a basket of bread and grissini and the flute glasses on the tray prompted Harriet to open the refrigerator and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perignon . Carlo appeared in the doorway , very spruce and beaming with pride . " See what a good provider I am ? " he said . " How did you do this ? Did you send Angela out for it ? " " I am hungry , " he said , " and you are my hostess . Let us not discuss domestic arrangements . Where shall I carry this tray ? " She told him and gave him the champagne to open . They sat close together at the round table in her small dining-room , and ate ravenously and laughed and teased each other . THE CONSTANT IMAGE " If I hated everything in your country , including you , " said Harriet , " I would still be seduced by the food . Where did these divine things come from ? " " From Peck 's , naturally . There is a salumeria in every fourth doorway in Milano , but only Peck is the be-all and the end-all . " " I 'm glad it began and I hope it never ends . Carlo , tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomorrow . Were you at school there with him ? Is that where you learned to speak such good English ? " " It was a type of school , I suppose , " he said , " but not in England . " " I know , the war , Pina said so . Of course I am trying to get you to talk about it . " " And of course I have no idea of doing such a thing . " He leaned over and kissed her nose and the deep hollows of her eyes , which gave him an uncommon pleasure of a sort he had never felt before . " I must go now . " She pictured him , arriving at his sister-in-law 's to pick up Pina at just the hour when he would have finished a leisurely dinner with the man to whom he had to talk business . " It was lovely , " she said , at the door , while he was putting on his overcoat . " It was . It has made me want something I had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " she asked , instead of showing the curiosity he expected . " Oh , I am very efficient , I have a big business to run and lots of other concerns to fit in  --  " " Be careful . Do n't say too much ! " " Cattiva ! What I should like , " he said , putting his hands on her ribs under the light peignoir , " is to take you to Bergamo with me next week when I go . " MARCIA DAVENPORT " You are going to Bergamo ? " " I go regularly  --  at least once every fortnight . And in winter I can not get back the same night on account of the fog . So I stay there . Would you like to come ? " " Oh , Carlo ! " She was afraid she sounded too happy ; she caught her voice on the edge of a tremor . He held her for a moment , looking into her face . His glowing brown eyes , his fine skin , his subtly sculptured mouth , his whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a model of Donatello 's , were for the moment hers and absorbed in her . " Ti piacio io ? " he asked softly , as if for the first time . " Tu lo sai , " she said , as he turned to go ; and when she had shut the door behind him she stood leaning against it , staring at the wall . What a language , she thought . To translate it was to make nothing of an infinity of meanings . Did he please her , indeed !  --   --  ' 7 ' * ' *CARLO DALVERTO stood as usual in the back of the box , regarding with satisfaction his beautiful wife and his beautiful mistress , his mother between them , and his friend Douglas Nevile seated behind them . His uncle Andrea Dalverio completed the party . Pina had chosen each guest for a good reason , Carlo 's relatives because the whole Dalverio family held Douglas Nevile in unique affection , and Harriet Piers because Pina had charted a fixed course through potentially troubled waters and intended to hold to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , each wearing a delicious folly from the milliner whom he knew as he knew everything which made women decorative and desirable ; and he thought , per bacco ! if people are peering at us and beginning to sharpen their tongues on us , they will at least admit I have superlativetaste ! He was always proud of Pina and confident of her wisdom and patience . Her intuition had always been swift and shrewd , but in this instance he believed now that she had sensed his attractionto Harriet Piers before he himself had realized it . Pina was hot-tempered and jealous ; he marvelled , with regret and a useless feeling of guilt , how she was facing this exaction greater than any he had put upon her before . Her actions had been90 91MARCIA DAVENPORTalmost too perfect , too finely judged and controlled ; yet what else was she to do ? And he vowed not for the first time that he would come through this without hurting her in any way that he would not be able to repair . He was deeply attached to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make her sure of it . As for Harriet  --  he smiled , with tenderness and a little ruefully . She was so young , and she did not know it ; artless , and she did not know that ; her efforts to play her part with skill and bravado were sometimes audacious and sometimes touching , but always intelligent ; she would be nonplussed and distressed if she should suspect that he saw all this . And occasionally he came up short with a flash of real fear lest she fall in love with him . If that should happen she would really be hurt and there would be little he could do to solace her . He had to escape into the sophistrythat this was an experience inevitable at this turn in her life , and that chance had made him the man with whom she was to have it . It was damnably unfortunate that she was so conspicuouslyalone . Much better had she been married or even a widow , those were natural situations in the sight of everybody here ; but a childless American divorcee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be made . And here was Pina doing everything in her power to maintain the facade of particularfriendship , an extension of her real friendship with Lydia Marchisi . There were aspects of it that could make him feel a fool if he allowed himself to glimpse them , but he knew better than to lapse towards that . He thought his party seemed more spellbound than the performancedeserved . The cast was uneven , the Scarpia , like most of them , could not project a convincing fusion of grand seigneur92THE CONSTANT IMAGEand savage malefactor , but the soprano was delivering an enthrallingVissi d'arte , and Dalverio listened critically , reflecting upon the mystery of that impalpable quality beyond the concretesuch as a voice , a type of looks , a perfection of technique , a physical personality , which could make art and supernal experienceout of material essentially banal , reducible to the abhorrentthrough overfamiliarity . He thought specifically of bungling students and bad singers who elected this aria for every test they had to meet ; and of a literal infinity of women with whom a sexual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one on the stage or a woman like Harriet Piers could infuse experience with such freshness that she wrought an illusion of marvellousnovelty . He was , of course , ruminating upon the mystery of genius , and upon the further mystery that even the most incontestablegenius could not affect alike all who were present when it passed their way . The soprano placed the two candelabra at the dead Scarpia 's head and feet and the crucifix on his breast , moving with schooled , fluid grace despite some portliness ; she held the dark illusion she had created whilst the drums rolled and she left the scene with the curtains falling and the applause beginning . The house lights came up and everybody stirred , changing position , talking , discussing , and exclaiming . " Come , let 's go and smoke , " said Carlo . " Mamma , I know you want your coffee . " " Why do n't you four go along ? I do n't want coffee now . Zio Andrea will keep me company and I see Maria Lavigna already on her way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , " said Douglas Nevile to Harriet as they went with Carlo and Pina to the Ridotto . " Spending a whole winter here . " 93MARCIA DAVENPORT " Yes , I am lucky . And it was so unplanned , it just happened . But you come often , I understand . " " I do some work for clients here . Patent-licensing , largely , there 's a lot of that now between one country and another . " Harriet assumed that Carlo was one of the clients and she smiled at Pina 's intimation that Mr. Nevile spoke little Italian . He did speak it , with an atrocious accent but considerable fluency , and Harriet could not put her finger on Pina 's reason for saying what she had . Nevile was a tall , sandy-haired , thin-featured man with fine blue eyes and a relaxed grace of manner , reserved but amiable ; he was , like Carlo , charming in his way and Harriet was entertainedat the vast difference between their ways , Carlo all glow and sparkle and kinetic magnetism , with easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a broader , less egotistical sense , quiet , interesting , and understated . It was plain that the two men were very good friends , linked by shared experienceswhich had their roots in the grace under pressure which has become one of the inspired definitions of men in our time . Harriet perceived that Douglas Nevile knew a Carlo who was sealed in a certain time-capsule difficult if not impossible for anyone now meeting him to penetrate , and she found herself wishing somehow to share in Nevile 's knowledge . She had also become aware in the short half hour at Biffi Scala where they had all met before the opera , that Nevile had immediately grasped the state of matters between herself and Carlo , a subtlety of perceptiveness clear in his grave friendliness towards Pina and the quiet twinkle of his eye whenever it caught Harriet 's . Or was that only a special communicativeness between two AngloSaxonsengendered by their enclosure in an alien , no matter how sympathetic , enclave ? THE CONSTANT IMAGEThey turned from the bar , chatting with various friends who drifted up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Dalveri , with pleasure at his reappearance and inquiries as to how long he was staying . Clearly he knew most of Carlo 's and Pina 's friends . " Do let 's stroll through the Museum , " he said to the three . " I 've not seen it this year and there 's always something not to be missed there . " They went in and wandered through the lovely rooms , whose integration into the theatre brought immediacy to the calligraphy , the manuscripts , and the personal mementos of the immortals who lingered on there . " It 's one of the best things in Europe , do n't you think ? " said Nevile to Harriet . " But in such a warm , natural way . It does n't seem a museum . " " No , " said Harriet , " and there are times when it seems particularlylike this one 's house or that . I always feel as if Rossini had just gone out and left his things behind . " " What a nice thought , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should write a good book about Rossini , " said Nevile . The bells rang for the last act and Harriet exclaimed , " Oh , we must hurry , we must n't miss the lights going down . " They laughed and she said , " I know , but I love that moment so . " As they came out to the lobby after the opera Carlo bought the last gardenias in the basket of one of the old pensioners from the Casa Verdi , pausing to chat with her for a moment . Harriet saw unintentionally the large denomination of the note that he held folded inside his palm and slipped into the old lady 's hand , and the tender private glance that Pina gave him as they moved along . For an instant Harriet 's eyes smarted ; she turned her head sharply as if to look for someone in the crowd , and swallowed94 95MARCIA DAVENPORThard . A moment later she noticed in the eyes of Carlo 's mother , Signora Nora , a thoughtful , penetrating expression which seemed to comprise a number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when the brown eyes for an instant looked into Harriet 's they conveyed kindliness but also , unless Harriet 's imaginationor conscience were hypersensitive , a faint censure . Harriet knew it for a warning , a warning which admitted that this woman 's son like other men must have his pleasures , but that no component of those pleasures would survive any disturbance to the immutability and wellbeing of her family . If she had known Signora Nora better Harriet might have yielded to a sudden impulse to grasp her hand for an instant and in pressing it , pledge deference to the inviolable ; as it was , she could only look clearly into the woman 's eyes and pray that her message was understood . They strolled across the Piazza and through the Galleria to Savini 's for supper , hungry and smiling and all talking together . Carlo and his party were greeted with affection which proclaimedthat this fine old restaurant with its warmth and brightnessand its air of burnished nineteenth-century luxury was and always had been a fixture in their lives . The older members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's uncle , everybody was made comfortable , the proprietor himself , attended by two captains , prepared to take the orders . Carlo said " Let 's see what our guests will have . " Harriet smiled and shook her head at the caviar , the smoked salmon and sturgeon , and the beautiful antipasti wheeled up on their carts . Nevile did not look at the menu . " Lots and lots of prosciutto first , please , " he said , " and then risotto al salto . " " Ditto , " said Harriet . " Bravo ! " said Zio Andrea . " The right choice . " He strokedTHE CONSTANT IMAGEhis full , old-fashioned moustache ; Harriet thought him a darling , with his smiling pink face and white hair . " The same for everybody , " said Carlo , without further inquiry . It was the perfect , classic supper and so simple that only a great restaurant could produce it to perfection . Nobody could say just why . With all the millions of Parma hams in Italy , said Zio Andrea , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its chiffon texture and its faint flavour of peaches ? And why , when a million Milanesi eat risotto most days of their lives , can one kitchen come forth with these crusted , sizzling discs of deliciousnesswhose origin was the frugal obligation to use up the remainsof the midday meal , and whose final destiny this masterpiece which nobody else could achieve ? " It must be the old question of reducing matters to their elements , " said Douglas Nevile . " One perceives perfection best at the level of fundamentals . It may exist in elaboration but then it can begin to be its own enemy . " " How long will you be here this time ? " Signora Nora asked him . " When are you coming to me ? " In the course of talk about the rest of the week Harriet heard that tomorrow was the wedding anniversary of Pina 's parents , which meant a full gathering of the Verocchi clan that would preempt Carlo and Pina for the evening . So she was not surprisedlater when Douglas Nevile as he escorted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the car , asked her to dine with him , and she told him she would be delighted . When Carlo telephoned next morning he asked , " How did you like my English friend ? " " Very much indeed . And I think , " she added , " that his powers of observation are acute . " 96 97MARCIA DAVENPORT " So are yours . Cara , you were beautiful and you are dis-creet . " She might have blurted that such an evening as last night was becoming increasingly difficult , hedged round with little spikes and warning markers and signals to which one must pay the minutest attention while keeping one 's footing and picking one 's way without ever seeming to look . But , she thought , this must be even truer for Pina than it is for me ; and she stifled the impulse to tell him so , though she knew she would please him . The trouble was that her admiration for Pina 's behaviour was purely of the mind ; her heart could not concur without stumbling . And this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not been listening , " said Carlo in his tone of reproach . He had been talking to her in ardent , breathless little words descriptive of her physical beauties and the particularity of his delight in them , and he wanted her to answer in kind . Insteadshe had only breathed , " yes . . . yes . . . " So he was a little cool when he asked whether she was dining with Douglas Nevile this evening . " Not only that , but I will jump ahead of you and say you are not to be tiresome and jealous about it . He 's your friend . " " He really is my friend , " said Carlo soberly . " But if I were in his place I suppose I would react in my normal manner to a tete-a-tete with anything as beautiful as you . Ah , I am terrible , bad , wicked , evil , treacherous  --  " " You are , " she said , " and if you do n't stop talking like this you will make me begin to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " As she said that , she was shaken by a sudden click of her wits which brutally asked her to consider whether there were other women beside herself in his life right now . My God ! she thought , with a shudder , it 's perfectly possible and I 've been THE CONSTANT IMAGEinfantile not to think of it . For an instant she felt heartsick and mortified . " Where are you dining , the Barca d'Oro ? " Carlo was asking . " Mr. Nevile did n't say . But Carlo  --  " her voice was very serious and he realized it . He was unused to that . He said , " Well ? " " I want to ask you something  --  please . Promise me you wo n't try to leave Pina 's family party and come to join us late some-where . " She would have seen , had she been able to , a darkness come over his face but move away as he recognized the pure good sense and kindliness of what she had said . He was touched ; eh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promise , " he said . " And are you coming to Bergamo with me on Monday ? " His voice became eager and warm again . " Yes , I am coming . " " All of you ? Each and every one of my treasures ? " " All of them . Everything . " Oh , my God , she thought . " You want to come , very much ? " " Very much . " " Cara . " " Darling . " " Do n't be too charming to Douglas , " he said fretfully . " Do n't be silly , " she replied . " I  --  " and she clapped her hand over her mouth . In the glass across the room she saw a look of horror on her face . What had she almost said ! " You what ? " He never missed anything . " What were you saying ? " " I want him to talk about you , " she said . " Why else do you think I 'm dining with him ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Carlo . " Of course98 99MARCIA DAVENPORTI shall be seeing him during the day and by this evening he will have had his orders . " " Hah ! " said Harriet , and with another ripple of amorous talk they finished with the telephone . It had been an interesting evening and it would have been one even had they not had Carlo to talk about . At eleven o'clock they were still sitting over their cognac , Douglas Nevile enjoying his cigar and the company of this uncommonly pretty woman who was gracefully subordinating the present , which could only be the tacit admission of her relation with Carlo , to the past when she had been a child and Nevile a young man whose experiences he was rather flattered to be begged to relate . In one 's middle forties , and by a person from another world and definition of age , it was surprising how one could let oneself be drawn out , well as he understood that it was Carlo 's part in the experiences that she wanted to know . It was , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1940 was a sub-lieutenant in the Italian forces in the Egyptian desert , and Douglas Nevile a captain assigned to secret intelligence with the Seventh Armoured Division of General Wavell 's armies which crushed the Italians at Sidi Barrani . In the course of certaininterrogations of Italian officers in the vast prisoner-of-war camps at Mersa Matruh , Nevile had been struck , he said , by some element of personality in young Dalverio which set the chap apart from the mass . " It sounds absurd , put in a few words now , but it was n't then and it was my job to look for certainTHE CONSTANT IMAGEpossibilities . I found that Dalverio had no use for Musso or any of his rot , that he belonged to a family of strong anti-Fascists , who at the same time kept out of politics , put one foot before the other , and minded their own business  --  very profitable business , of course . They were n't the type to risk all for love , war , or any other high flights such as we or you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the usual realistic views and the usual ability to put up , shut up , and survive . Their son was in the army because everybody 's son was in the army . He had no use for what he was doing . He did n't believe in it and he scorned the whole jackal performance . " " Was his father still alive then ? " asked Harriet . " Oh , yes , very much so . " " I 've got the impression , " she said , " that his father died in some way connected with the war but I do n't know quite why I think that  --  I 've had a feeling that Carlo would be reluctant to talk about it if I asked . " " I expect he would . His father was splendid in his own way . " Harriet understood that Nevile would come to that in due course . Nevile went on to relate that his first impressions of Carlo had been put to stringent and protracted reappraisals , and that Carlo had passed every test of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Nevile , " we stumbled on the sort of coincidenceit would never occur to one to invent . Going back as we had to into Carlo 's family history we found that the Dalverio grandfather had fought with Garibaldi . It happens that a distant cousin of my own was one of those Tuscan Englishmen like Hugh Forbes , who also joined Garibaldi at Rome and in Sicily . In the circumstances it was a bond between Carlo and me . I daresay it meant more than it would in ordinary times . At anv100 101MARCIA DAVENPORTrate , when we were preparing for the invasion of Sicily early in 1943 , I asked for Dalverio 's release because I needed such a man in particular jobs that I was going to have to do , and he was the man I wanted . " " And did they release him ? " " Not without the greatest trouble . It took a long time and I never quite believed we could pull it off . Finally they gave in and paroled him in my custody  --  most irregular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal responsibility . " " So that your life was in his hands . " " And his in mine . I never made a better bargain . He was invaluable . He was with us , with me , actually , from Sicily in July until the end . He was in the greatest imaginable danger . He belonged to nothing , in the event that he was captured . Nobody would have been able to acknowledge him . He had no uniform , no papers , no identity . He simply melted into the population wherever we were , dressed in rags and living I ca n't think how . " " A spy for you . " Harriet was sitting spellbound , her chin on her clasped hands . " He was whatever we needed  --  reconnaissance , messages , information , anything that could be done by an Italian , a peasant or a workman or whatever , and not by one of us . He was not only on his own among the people and in case he fell into the hands of the Germans or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us except to a strictly closed list . " " Did n't he ever emerge  --  even towards the end ? " " Towards the end , yes . After they had organized Mamma Mia and  --  " " What in the world was that ? " He laughed . " Of course , it does sound odd . The Military Mission to the Italian Army . That was after they had come in with us , though they did n't really get into action until January . " 102THE CONSTANT IMAGE " Which January ? " She spoke without thinking how queer this would sound to a man whose whole life was marked by the calendar of those years , when she had been a schoolgirl and could now remember little of her remote impressions of the war. " 1945 , " said Nevile . " Carlo expected to go back to an Italian unit in action on the Po , but the previous autumn he heard that the Germans had arrested his father . " " Where ? " asked Harriet , with a slight gasp . " Right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what a good many Italians did , hiding Jews and political fugitives , helpingthem escape to Switzerland , looking after their families . And helping the partisans with money and supplies . All behind the facade of business as usual . They were quite matter-of-fact about it . " " What happened to him ? " " They sent him in a transport to Mauthausen . " " A concentration camp . " " Yes , in Austria . A bad one . " " Did they  --  did he  --  " " No . He did n't die there . Many did , very many . He was still alive there when the war ended and Carlo went and brought him home . " By the ensuing silence Harriet realized that Carlo had brought home a dying man , and presently Nevile said , " He did n't live long . He was never able to eat , not at all . I saw him before he died that summer , only a bit after the war ended . " " So Carlo did stay with you until the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father , and even I do n't know everything he did . He was a brave , resourceful man . " Nevile smiled rather sadly . " It 's not often one knows an Italian in just the combination of circumstances which brings out those qualities . They 're very different from us. " 103MARCIA DAVENPORT " Cynical . " " Yes , and rational . All the silliness about them , the gestures and the panache , the hot tempers  --  it does n't mean a thing . Underneathit 's cold reason . They 'll fight when they care what they are fighting for , but they very seldom care . Once they do care they can fight , and their endurance is quite unbelievable . " " They care about their families , " said Harriet quietly . " And not much else , which is n't surprising in view of their history . " " I like them very much . " " So do I. But for quite other reasons than the usual , the superficial ones . Sometimes I find them irritating . Their bureaucracyand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy and their efficiency  --  and their charm  --  " They laughed . Suddenly Harriet said , " Do you know Pina well ? " " I do n't think so , really . I doubt that anyone does except her family . Of course I came to their wedding . " " When was that ? " " In the autumn of ' 46 . You ca n't think how extraordinary it all looked to me . I 'd left here a little over a year before , when Milan was like every place else , rubble and ruins and all that . Even then , though , they had shops open and trams and taxis runningwhen nobody else had . And when I came for Carlo 's weddingI could scarcely believe my eyes . Lots of ruins still , but everything going full tilt , Carlo and all his friends making money , everybody beautifully dressed and well fed , the war might never have been . They 'd even rebuilt the Scala and opened it  --  less than a year after the end of the war . Incredible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . " " Of course . But the labour was theirs , that driving energyTHE CONSTANT IMAGEI believe they 'd have got it done anyway , without the American money . And there we were dragging along at the very bottom of things , grim and rationed and nothing done . Those ghastly queues and coupons . " " I know . Even I know about that . I was in England in 1947 . And even I had sense enough to ask who won the war . " " It 's curious , you know , I never expected then that I 'd have a friend here such as Carlo has been . One gets through a war , surprised to be alive , and goes home  --  " he shrugged . " He 's devoted to you . " " As I said , one does n't expect it . Or perhaps I mean , not of an Italian . " She smiled , gathering up her gloves and purse . " I know , " she said. 104 105*  --   --  8  --   --  *CARLO sang most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idiotic mixture of love songs old and new , arias , American and Italian jazz , and a string of dirty little ditties whose words Harriet suspected he improvised . He knew he was acting like a boy and he was loving it . He taught Harriet some of his songs and prompted her to fill in when the songs were funnier as duos . He drove his Ferrari with diabolical speed and swagger , causingHarriet to marvel , between suppressed gasps and starts of terror , that this frightening form of juvenilism should persist in the Italian man . Like most Americans she was a natural excellentdriver and Norton Piers had been one of the early leaders of the sports car craze , so that she had driven the fastest kinds of cars all over the United States and in Europe . But she knew , with a secret chauvinistic scorn , that Italian women except for a few among the gilded youth , were not expected to drive cars well , if at all ; that the men considered women drivers  --  good ones especially  --  an affront to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to be inert and unversed in this subjectunless she should have something to compliment him about . Her feet tingled with the effort not to push them through the floor when he roared past a file of trailer trucks on the brow of106THE CONSTANT IMAGEa curving hill , singing at the top of his lungs and glowing with happiness . He does , thank God , keep both hands on the wheel , she said to herself ; but so far the keynote of this trip is Do n't Look Now . " Ri-cor-da-te Mar-cell-i-no , " sang Carlo , with the bouncing verve of Carosone himself , and Harriet , infected with his gaiety , also felt that in herself it was only thinnest and brightest veneer . What lay beneath she was not quite sure ; certainly an uneasinessshe had not expected to feel , and on every side the echo of the injunction not to look now . Yet she was afraid to be so reckless as not to look . Her absence from Milano had begun at the week end at Bellagio with Lydia and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Lecco , where the largest of his factories was . Harriet had come there in her little car the short distance from Bellagio and met him at a certain garage on the outskirts of the town , just after the noon whistles blew . She had left her car there , and tomorrow morning they would reversethe plan , when Harriet would go back to town in her own car alone . There was not much leeway for a catastrophic slip , but she could not feel easy in mind , and she was troubled that Lydia was in any degree related to the situation . She had said to Lydia when they were strolling on the terrace , gazing at the dark sparkling water and the glorious sight of the mountains in their winter dress , " Sometimes I wish I 'd never got into this . " " Sometimes I wish it too , " Lydia replied . " But you have , and we need n't go over the same old ground again  --  it will be all right if you keep your head . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've seen her she 's been calmer and smoother and more remote . I realized on Wednesday evening that she and I have never looked each other straight in the eye . Do you know how grotesque that is ? " 107MARCIA DAVENPORT " For you , it is . For Pina , I tell you , she 's been through this many times before and she 'll have to go through it many times again . Stop writhing about it , darling , or you 'll lose your footing and then there will be some kind of mess . Do it , or do n't . " Well , she was doing it . But she had not reckoned with the perfectly silly factor of terror at Carlo 's driving which was actuallybrilliant no matter how it looked ; he had the car wholly under control and she knew that as well as he did . And the sun was shining as they sped their right , and the peaks of Sopracornola sparkling in snow , on their left . The road , said Carlo , had long been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industrial traffic that filled it , with an ancient interurban tram-track on one side and a sharp-edged ditch on the other ; Dio ! the accidents ! But lately it had been rebuilt , it was well surfaced and spaced with the gay red and white markers of the province of Bergamo , and he knew every centimetre of it like the palm of his hand . " And there 's no fog now , " said Harriet happily . " Not at midday ! " " I do n't see how you people stand it . The strain and the tension , and having to time everything by it . " " Sometimes that has its uses , " he said , with a snicker . " It 's true that most of the time the fog is impossible after four in the afternoon and Pina can not endure the torment if I drive in it . She prefers me to stay in Bergamo . " Even , thought Harriet uncomfortably , at the cost of this sort of thing . She only said , " But think  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Exactly . When it is glorious there the fog is worst of all in the Pianura . " " And the moon at night too ! " THE CONSTANT IMAGE " The moon also tonight , I think , " he said . " The wind seems right . " " Where are we going to stay ? " she asked , with a note of shynesswhich caused him to glance at her and smile as at a child . " You will see . In a very old house in Bergamo Alta which has been there for many centuries . " " Not a hotel ? " She felt uneasy . He laughed . " A hotel ? Me  --  in Bergamo ? My dear child . " " Oh , I thought  --  " " Just thought you could disappear into a large beautifully appointed suite like any tourist and have a caller . Not in Bergamo . There are several quite comfortable hotels used largely by business men , most of whom I know . I own one of the hotels and all the people in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them would care what I did or with whom , cara , butecco . " The gate was closed at the level crossing at Sala , and he stopped the car . The gate-keeper was not in sight , nor was anybody else . It was the hour when people were eating , leaving the road and the surroundings deserted . Carlo took Harriet in his arms and kissed her , with tenderness and a depth of feeling startlingin contrast to his boisterous mood roused by fast driving and the exciting presence of Harriet in a new setting . She was shaken , this was one of the most unexpected things he had done . She was familiar with his kisses and caresses in every phase of pleasure and passion , but at this gentleness , almost poetic in its harmony with the calm countryside and the smiling sunshine , she was wonder-struck . He saw in her eyes what she felt . Then she closed them , with a slight motion as if to turn her head for escape into the eternal necessity to dissemble . But he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid . " " Of what ? " she whispered , looking again into his eyes , very108 109MARCIA DAVENPORTdark now and deep with feeling . She saw their expression change a little , a faint contraction cross his face as if of muscles bidden to brace themselves . " My God , I am not quite sure , " he muttered , and kissed her again . The train came shrieking down the track , and the gate-keeper from her house , to turn the crank which raised the bars . They started again and the remaining half-hour of the way Harriet listened , fascinated , to Carlo 's descriptions which she prompted with questions that surprised him by their acumen , of the work of his factories and their relation to the whole industrial complexof this region . She had not known what it was that the Lecco factory made . She was astonished when he explained that it produced most of the steel wire used in Italy for making the spokes of bicycle and motorcycle wheels . It also made most of the metal stripping used for umbrella-ribs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked about the relative quantities of these products she was open-mouthed at his replies ; they might not seem large in the United States , she said , but they were enormous here . Yes , he nodded , an umbrella was a joke in a sense , but Italian umbrellas in recent years had become a large export like thousands of other small manufactured articles ; and the cycle industry was no trifle by any measure . Much of his wheel-spoke production went up the lake to Mandello to the big motorcycle works which employed so much of the labour of the region . Suddenly he glanced at her and said , " How should you be interested in such things ? Why do you know enough to ask questions about industry ? " " Oh , I do n't know much , " she said , " but I 've been taught  --  what one needs to understand . " " For what ? A woman . . . " THE CONSTANT IMAGEShe laughed . " Money , darling . How can one understand investmentsif one does n't know anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said again , shaking his head . " What have you to do with investments ? " " I manage my own . " He was incredulous . " How can you ! " he said , almost jeering . " Well , I was made to , by my grandmother . Have n't you ever heard that more than half the invested money in the United States belongs to women ? " " Heard it , " he said , jerking his head , " but who could believe it ? " " Well , it 's true . And my grandmother was the only child of a rugged old roughneck who made his money in mining  --  oh , it 's all such ancient history , Carlo . " " No , go on . I 'm fascinated . What kind of mining ? " He was no longer driving like a racer . " Copper , lead , silver , various gambles in Nevada and Colorado . He left it all to his daughter , and she really had a head for business . " " Which grandmother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Then why have you the money ? What about your father ? " Harriet sighed . This was the sort of thing she knew no Italianwould understand and would disapprove with his whole soul if he could understand . " My father , " she said . " Well  --  my grandmother did n't think much of him . I suppose it was her own fault , she brought him up  --  but the way he turned out , she simply left him an allowance to live on and left her money to me with directions that I was to be taught to take care of it . " Carlo 's face was a study . Harriet was not sure whether he was more astonished or more affronted . MARCIA DAVENPORT " I 'm sorry , " she said , with a little laugh . " I know it sounds horrifying here . But it 's not the least peculiar in the United States . " " And where is your father now ? " " He lives in Mexico . " " I thought your parents were in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said , resigned . " Do n't make me spell it all out , Carlo . Everybody 's been divorced and remarried , on and off the merry-go-round , and  --  " she looked at him with an expressionwhich moved him sharply  --  " I loathe it . " " Poveretta , " he murmured . " Compared with your lives here , it 's a shambles . " " But if you were Pina , " he said , with sudden pungency , " if you had Pina 's life to live , you 'd have divorced me long ago . " " That 's what I did , " she said quietly , " and here I am . There Pina is . Oh , look , Carlo , is that Bergamo ? " " Yes , but do n't look down there to your right . That 's BergamoBassa , modern Bergamo . Look up there . " He pointed to the left , where the soft pinkish mass of an ancient town clung , gently moulded to the shoulder of a mountain . " Bergamo Alta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town is unspoilt and the modern one has room to grow . " " And your factories here  --  " " Basta factories ! I 'm hungry ! " " Tell me what you 've got here , " she insisted , " you made me talk . " One of his factories made cylindrical steel products , he said ; drums and tubing and such for the chemical industry ; another made metallic parts for small machinery , anything which moved or turned or rolled ; electrical appliances , for instance , but an infinityof things . How many coffee-grinders do you suppose are112THE CONSTANT IMAGEmanufactured in Italy , and we make the ratchet gears for most of them . Gears for any kind of small machine . " And now , " he said swinging the car to the left and starting up a long , climbing street , " keep quiet , because I am worn out with talking and I want my lunch . " The street rose towards the upper town , branching at its end right and left . He followed the right-hand turn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gateway in the old city wall to let another car come through . Harriet looked at the lion of San Marco on the arch and asked whether Bergamo too had been part of the Venetian Republic . " For three hundred years it was ; the westermost part . It was fortified then , all this was walled . " It is fortified still , she reflected , in its own beauty . She had seen many of the celebrated hill cities of Italy and learnt their histories with more than the usual tourist 's interest ; but this , of which she had heard nobody speak in the same terms as Assisi , Arezzo , Gubbio , Todi , Orvieto , had its own quality of wholly unexpected enchantment . Perhaps that was Lombard ; she wondered why , looking at the shuttered houses squeezing the narrowstreets , their faded tints soft as cushions that one might reach out and touch . The shops were closed , the streets deserted , the people had eaten and were shut in their houses resting . Carlo drove past the Piazza where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose gracefulness and intimacy made Harriet think , this looks like a cosy place ; but she said nothing . He swept round back of the Piazza and stopped before a very old house , faded to a creamy , sandy tone that was neither xanthous nor grey , wonderfully garnished with wrought iron and spread across the crest of the rise between similarly beautiful neighbours. 113MARCIA DAVENPORTHe leapt from the car and came round to help her out . The central doorway of the house was a great pane of glass , and through it she saw a small balustraded courtyard , with doors right and left to the interior , and beyond the balustrade the sight which made her stop , her eyes enormous , and gasp , " Oh ! How divinely beautiful ! " Carlo led her through the courtyard as an old manservant dressed in a red and black striped jacket with brass buttons came forward from the entrance at the right , beaming at Carlo and bowing to Harriet with easy grace . " We 're starving , Domenico , " said Carlo . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready . Come , " he said to Harriet , " this way . " " Oh , just a moment , " she begged . " Please let me look ! " She was standing at the graceful balustrade , looking down over the terraced fall of gardens clinging to the bottoms of the houses , green even in the midst of winter ; and at the descending planes of the ancient roofs moulded to the hillside up which they had come ; and beyond them to the sweeping Lombard plain , with the modern city of Bergamo filling the foreground and the richestfarmlands of Italy spreading away as far as the eye could see . She found the sight one of those beauties too moving to make possible any words ; she reached for Carlo 's hand and stood there squeezing it , gazing before her . " Yes , yes , I know it is beautiful , I am glad you like it , " he said , " but please wo n't you come upstairs before I drop dead of starvation ? " She let herself be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view ; but when he took her inside and started up a wide , shallow stair curving through niched and vaulted walls , and opened a high , richly decorated door , she stood in the great room and said , " I had no idea . I never imagined . " THE CONSTANT IMAGEThe room was dim , soaring and vaulted at the top , with a frescoed ceiling of the Venetian school , tumbling with colour and glinting with gold . The dark rosy silk walls were hung with portraits and old-fashioned landscapes ; the floor of exquisite hardwood mosaic was laid with small , precious rugs ; the furniture was old , grown into its setting over a span of continuous age so long that one epoch blended imperceptibly into another ; even the ugly and clumsy things of the last century were effortlesslyabsorbed . " How lovely , " she whispered , looking slowly all round the room . " How perfectly lovely . Carlo , is this your family 's old home ? " He nodded , leading her to a small dining-room opening from the salon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had to tell . " My grandfather and his brothers were the last to live here . The next generation , my father 's , began moving to Milano . " Domenico began to serve their luncheon . " Your Garibaldi grandfather ? " He smiled , pointing to a portrait . " That one . " " But he has n't got a red shirt ! That 's a different uniform . " " No . The red shirts were earlier and also later . This uniform is the Cacciatori delle Alpi  --  see the hat with the feather ? The Alpini wear them still . Of course the portrait is a pasticcio , it was painted years later . My grandfather joined the Cacciatori when he was fifteen years old  --  in 1859 . It was not the thing to do , you know , among good families . " " I did n't know . I thought  --  " " Oh , people were proud of it later . We have all been taught to be . But many Italians will tell you that the Cacciatori and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DAVENPORT " So were the Minute Men . " " Well  --  so are most libertarians . The Bergamaschi always have been , they have always resisted tyranny . " Harriet remembered her evening with Douglas Nevile . But she only said , " Who lives in this house now ? It 's a big house ... " " I keep this part of it  --  just a small flat ; and the rest is rented to various people . There are a few old relatives tucked away in it , of course . " She was looking preoccupied , her expression was full of uneasyconcern . He knew what she was thinking ; he might have been impatient with another sort of woman for such thoughts , but no lady , he knew , could help feeling as this one does . She looked at him then and said what she had all morning refrained from saying . " You mean that this flat here is just yours ?  --  that Pina and your children never come here ? " " Never , cara . If it must have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garconniere . And yet , to me it is not quite such a flippancyas that . " He looked for a moment round the room . " If you wanted to believe that I use it more because of my business and because of my sentiment about the place , which Pina does not share , than for my much-advertised sins , you would be right . " That last might or might not be true ; but there was no doubt of his attachment to the house and to the ancient groundwork of his family . One thing appeared clear , and she said it with relief . " It does make me feel I know you better , " she said . " Like  --  " " Like what ? " " Your friend Douglas Nevile told me some interesting things last week . More interesting , even , in the light of all this . " " People will talk . " " I 'm afraid you 're so right . " They looked at each other with comical resignation . " Tell me , how old is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It must be  --  ma ! Some of it sixteenth century , some much earlier . Bergamo is old . " " That always seems so wonderful to us . " " Will you have some cognac ? " he asked , when Domenico had served their coffee . " I do n't think so , thank you . " He touched her cheek . " I want none either . I do want  --  " His brown eyes glowed . " Do you ? " She did not feel like talking about it . They went back through the salon towards another pair of tall decorated doors at the far end of the room . Walking along with him , spellbound by aged beauty , his arm across her shoulders , she wanted to be lost wholly in this moment and in the enchanted past ; she wanted no intrusive thoughts flung off from the corrosive wheels of actuality ; nothing of the mundane . He might have spoken the truth a moment ago , but she could not evade the crudity , shoving , grimacing at her in spite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had come here with him , and the probability that Pina never came because if he were to have such a retreat at all , she much preferred it be away from Milano . Desecration , thought Harriet , heartlessness ; those women !  --  how I hate to be one of them . I want to be different , I want to be a rarity and cherished , I want to be myself . Suddenly the voice of pure reason , like one crystal drop , tinged in her mind 's ear . If Pina can put up with her lot , it said , you can put up with yours . " Now you will sleep , " said Carlo , bending over to kiss her again . He went to knot his necktie at the looking-glass ; she lay117MARCIA DAVENPORTand watched him finish dressing . He ran the comb through his thick hair , which , Harriet said , had the purely Italian genius for growing exactly as it should ; put on his jacket , feeling in his pockets for the things he carried ; and fastened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrists , strong , flexible , delicately shadowed with dark hair . " It is three o'clock , " he said , " and I must go to work . Can you occupy yourself for the afternoon ? I shall be here by seventhirty . Shall I send the car back in case you want to use it ? " She smiled . " No , thank you , " she said . " I 've got my plans all made . " " I suppose you are going out to buy a factory . " He wagged his head . " Wicked . I am going out to walk all over this lovely old town and I am going to the Duomo and the Cappella Colleoni and  --  " " Well , that is very commendable . And you will be good and tired later so I will find you meek and complaisant and can do whatever I like with you . " She shut her eyes , smiling , to hide if she could the unspoken retort that he could do whatever he liked anyway . When he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the linen heavy as leather , and the hard woollen pillows which she had come to like , her arms folded beneath her head ; and she stared at another fine painted ceiling and took stock of herself and her situation and found that she had no answer for anything . Late that night Carlo drew his arm from beneath her head and quietly got out of bed . He stood looking at her for a moment in the light from the shaded lamp on the table ; then he put out the light and she heard him crossing the pitch-dark room to the windows . She heard the heavy curtains as he drew them , theTHE CONSTANT IMAGEthick scuff of the casements , the clank of the iron latch and the creak of the shutters as he pushed them quietly open . He stood looking out , silhouetted against the white light of the moon . Harrietfelt the air , delicious and not very cold . She saw him , a beautifulcreature of hard flesh and muscles , reminding her more than ever as he stood naked in the pale light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not feel cold , she thought , for he had not grown soft since the years when the cruellest cold was part of his lot along with hunger and hardship and danger . He turned from the window and came over to her , catching up a blanket from the foot of the bed . " Come , " he said , " I want to show you something . " She threw off the bedclothes but beforeshe could rise he picked her up in his arms , dropping kisses wherever they fell upon her body ; and setting her on her feet , he wrapped her in the blanket and led her to the window . They stood silent , Carlo holding her in his arms . Spread before them they saw the tender mass of ancient masonry , mute behind its blinds and shutters , one block of pink or ochre nestling against the next , as if for company and comfort , the groups and clusters melting together beneath their dark , low , serrated roofs ; only the campanili of the churches rose above the gentle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The milky , faintly misty white light lay across it all , spraying it with lustre , spreading down from the mountains in a wide , shallow sweep to the distant plain below . It glowed with light and silence . Any sound , any motion , would have been desecration , but Harriet felt tears of sheer ecstasy sliding down her cheeks and Carlo 's arms trembled faintly as he held her , standing there and gazing at the shimmering white globe and its radiance streaming across the beauty it had illuminated for a thousand years . MARCIA DAVENPORTPerhaps they stood for twenty minutes , perhaps less ; but when they stirred at last , to turn towards the room , they saw that the bed lay full in the white light . Carlo took the blanket from her shoulders and laid her down , staring at her face . " You will not be too cold ? " he whispered , and she shook her head . His eyes kept their rapt , solemn expression , something she had never seen before ; every flash and play of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had learnt to know them well , but this was new . He lay raised on one elbow staring at her , from the tips of her feet to the wide arcs of her dark brows , tracing with fingertips like feathers the lines and curves , the light and the dark , the moulding of fine flesh and delicate bones . He was silent , while she looked at him , knowing now that she could no more keep her heart from showing in her eyes than her body from his gaze . He knew he should have spoken ; he should for reason 's sake have broken the spell of this beauty shining in celestial light and brought it back to earthly pleasure ; he should play , he should shout , he should get on with it in all its joy and heat and gusto . He was dumb . He looked into the wide , pale eyes , wide with helpless admission of the truth . His mouth trembled , he let his eyelids fall ; he heard his voice choked and struggling , say " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had crossed into a country where the old charts and guideposts might be useless.  --   --  *BuT life went on as before ; and since in all his experience he had never yielded to the power of romance to shake judgment , disrupt order , and make misery , he was not going to do so now . He was not going to allow Harriet to surrender to any such assaultseither . Though this bade fair to absorb him more than any love-affair he had ever had , it too would be kept within the bounds of the good sense and realism by which he had always lived , fortified by generations of equally sensible forefathers . In Bergamo even at a moment of revelation he had not needed to remind himself of this , and he had sensed from the first the particular dangers waiting to confound a man who committed himself even by a word to a romantic adolescent , which sane people supposed all Americans to be in matters of love . Look at their books and magazines , look at their films , listen to their songs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harriet herself and that pasticcio of a family of hers . In fact , she had no family , she had only a mess of broken trunks and boughs , and trees uprootedlike the tragic sight of the ruined park at Cernobbio a year or two ago after the tornado ; nothing to give her strength or shelter . Poveretta ! he thought , as he had done before . It was too soon to judge how she would consistently behave , but she120 121MARCIA DAVENPORT had learnt so much , so well , so quickly , that he hoped for the best . Still , he was alert to the dangers . The time since Bergamo had held no surprises , thank God ; their separate returning to Milano had gone without a slip , and how much more Pina knew than she had before he did not know and did not want to speculate about . Driving back to Lecco where Harriet was to take her own car , they had talked quietly , agreeing that the time had come to be seen a little less often to- gether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand there must be no sense of a break ; it was a thing to be judged carefully whilst they made their way through the mined terrain where any misstep could detonate a scandal . It is not Pina , he said , who would precipitate a disaster so long as we act with dis- cretion and I keep her reassured . " I know , " she said . " It is other women . " She looked at him for a moment , her lips pressed together , very reluctant to say something . He touched her gently and said , " What is it , cara ? " " Sometimes when I have seen women , " she was thinking out her words carefully ; " sometimes  --  oh , you know where they gather  --  " " At Sant Ambroeus , " he nodded , " over those sweets , and at the hairdresser 's ; and they meet at Pirovano , and Ferragamo  --  yes , I know what you mean . And they look at you in a certain way  --  " She nodded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything Pina ever shows . " " They are curious , rather , perhaps , " he said . " No , jealous . Two or three whom I recognize by sight but have n't met . I can imagine exactly what they are saying . " " And why ? " She nodded again . " It would be too much to expect me not to sense that . " It would , he thought . Obviously certain former mistresses of his would be brutally curious about her , and some jealous , and all indifferent whether they embarrassed her . On the other hand , those who had settled down to real friendship , like Tia Ortolani , were the greatest help ; people wove these webs of mutual understandingout of the filaments of long ago , long after any currenthad ceased to charge them . " Well , " he said , " what you say may be so . But so long as Pina remains as she is , that is your protection as well as mine , from real trouble or scandal . " Harriet said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not gone to see her every day , partly because he wished not to make it too much of a habit , and partly because when he did not go to her he went straight home as soon as he could finish at his office . If Pina was secretly unhappy at the reason for his extra attention she was also consoled by it . And such was the confutative nature of man that while his hours with Harriet were growing into the most ecstatic experience that he had ever known , his love for his home and his children , and his tenderness and gratitude to Pina were deeper than they had ever been before . When he came into Harriet 's flat one afternoon late in Januaryshe was finishing a conversation on the telephone . " Fine , " she said . " I 'll be there on Thursday afternoon . No , 122 123MARCIA DAVENPORTbut I wanted new ones anyway , and I can get Heads up there . Anything I can bring you ? " She held up her lips to Carlo , with the telephone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Pucci , but it 'll probably cost as much right here . ' Bye , darling . " When they had embraced until they could forget the need of it for the moment , he asked , " Where will you be on Thursday and who is Sadie ? " " St. Moritz . " His eyebrows went up in peaks . " Those are some friends of mine from San Francisco , Sadie and Robert Keyes . They 've just landed in Paris on the polar route on their way to St. Moritz . " " But what is this , so suddenly ? " He scowled , but she moved into his arms and with all the little things he liked , with words and certain sorts of kisses , she tried to please him . She held his face between her hands and with her lips caressed his eyes , his brows , the corners of his mouth , the silky tops of his cheeks , whispering in English , " Darling , Oh , darling . " " Not that ! " he said , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this one word of hers . He held her hands tightly and said , " Not darling . Sadie is darling and Lydia is darling and everybody is darling  --  " " Everybody is tesoro here , " she said . " And I got so used to thinking I would never be able to tell you what I felt or call you anything I meant  --  " " So you call me darling in English because it does n't mean anything . I see . " " Do n't tease me , " she whispered . " Do n't scold . " " Va bene . What am I to you ? What do you want to call me ? " " My love , " she said , her lips touching his . " Amore mio . But I was afraid . You do n't mind ? " Her voice was timid . THE CONSTANT IMAGE " No , I do n't mind , " he muttered , " God help me . Now what is this about St. Moritz ? " " These are skiing friends of mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a week at St. Moritz . " " When , long ago ? " She could not understand why he catechized her so closely and why he made such a play  --  if it was a play  --  of jealousy . Ca n't he see , she thought , that I could not look at another man ? " When was this ? " he repeated . " Months ago , when I wrote I was going to stay here for the winter . Usually we meet at Sun Valley . And I 'd forgotten all about it because  --  oh ! " she cried , " you know why ! Oh , darling  --  ! " and she clung to him . " Oh , I 'm sorry , I forgot all about the silly word , I only want  --  " " Yes ? " he said , with the note of excitement , and she saw it in his eyes . " What do you want ? " She whispered in his ear and he stood up and carried her to her room , all in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So now tell me this thing about St. Moritz , " he said later , lying with his arm under her head . " Well , as I told you , I 've had something else on my mind , and I 'd forgotten just when I had said I 'd meet them . And as it turns out , they 've had to come early because of a law case he has to be back for . So they 've got the rooms booked for Thursday , I ca n't imagine how , and to tell you the truth  --  " she turned her head and looked at him quietly . " What ? " " Do n't you think , " she said slowly , " it might be wise if I were to be away somewhere for a week and you here  --  you see ? " He did see , and she was right . " But what shall I do ? " he said , in the queer fretful tone which if one did not know him124 125MARCIA DAVENPORTwell one would think petulant . It had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " A week , you say , and St. Moritz  --  per 1'amore di Dio ! I sha n't have an instant'speace . How can I tell what will happen there ? " " Nothing will happen , " she said . " Nothing . Do n't you understand ? Nothing can possibly happen . " " Why ? The whole porco mondo is there ! " " But what difference can that make to me ? Do n't you understand ? " she said again . " Understand what ? " She bit her lips . " If I say it you 'll be cross , " she murmured . " My God , I go mad trying not to say it ! " " Not to say what ? " He was eager again , and excited , leaning over her intently . " What I must n't say , " she said , almost wailing . " What does n't exist in Italian , and if it did , I still should n't say it . " " Say it , then , say it in English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her head sadly . " No . " " Say it ! " " Very well , " she said in English . " Listen to it , since you insisted . I love you . I love you . Do n't you know it ? Oh , Carlo , do n't you know it ? " She was almost in tears . " Yes I know it , my poor child . " He had heard her with emotion , he was very moved but he was prudent too . He held her , caressing her face with one hand and tingling with pleasure when she kissed his fingers as they touched her lips . " I know . " " And it was not supposed to happen . " " No , it was not . " " But it has . " He saw in her face what she was trying to hide , the longing 126THE CONSTANT IMAGEto hear him reply with the words which his language was too wise and too spare and too subtle to indulge in . " Be good , " he whispered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Anch'io , ti voglio bene , tanto bene . Oh ! come sei bella ! " he cried , as if for the first time . " Come mi piaci ! " And Harriet thought , with that shred of her mind not engulfedin the vortex , we are right back where we started . He telephoned her at St. Moritz every day , sometimes twice or three times . He kept such close track of her days and nights that he might almost have been there himself , as he had of course , many times . He knew exactly when one went out to ski , when one came in , when one gathered for cocktails before luncheon and dinner among the darlings and the pet-names who formed the bejewelled lid of the world 's most extravagant human snuffbox . He liked an occasional dip into that world but he did not want Harriet in it without him . He should have been there , they both said , it would have been heaven ; but since he was not he had to content himself with her answers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew every slope and every mountain and if he was surprised at the skiing he heard she did , he kept it to himself . She must be very good indeed , far better than he had imagined , and he was tormented by the desire to be there with her . Then those damned parties ; who was there ? " Who is paying court to you ? " he asked , every time they spoke . " Who is flirting with you ? " " Nobody , Carlo , nobody , believe me. " 127MARCIA DAVENPORT " Nobody ? " " Truly . Nobody . " " But they ca n't all be blind , they ca n't all be pederasts ! " " Oh , my God , why is this a good connection from Milano ? " " The line to Switzerland is always good . Tell me , what areyou wearing now ? " She was dressing for dinner . She told him . " And under that ? " She told him . " And under that ? " She hesitated and he began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hotel ... " " The better for them . If they listen they will hear me kiss you . . . here . And here . And here . " " This is terrible , " she breathed . " What is terrible ? " " You know . " " Cara . Is it , really ? " His voice throbbed . When she went back to her dressing-table her eyes looked as though they were full of belladonna , and her hands shook . She sat still , staring into the glass , until she was calm enough to pick up the little brush and go back to smoothing her eyebrows . Then the day before she was to leave Carlo said , " Cara , listen . Do n't come back to Milano tomorrow . " She had a horrible vision of some disaster there , even of Pina having overheard him on the telephone . Surely he could not be so bungling . She felt sick and he heard her gasp . " No , no , be tranquil . Nothing is wrong . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away for two or three days  --  " Her heart gave a lurch . " But not here , " she said . " You know who is  --  " " Of course , of course . Not there . The Arlberg . " " Oh , Carlo . Not St. Anton . That 's dangerous . " " No , Lech . Do you know anyone who goes there ? " THE CONSTANT IMAGEShe did not . " Then when you leave St. Moritz tomorrow go on to Zernez . Be at the Esso Garage there at one o'clock . On the farther side of the town , just before the bridge . " Oh , my God , she thought , I hope it 's all right . He must be thinking the same thing . There were no amorous palpitations in this conversation . He understood , it was wonderful how quick he was . " Do n't worry , cara , " he said . Like any man he hated explanationsbut he wanted to put her at ease . ' Tina 's aunt in Brussels is very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Pina is her favourite niece . She 's got to go there today . " Harriet breathed a sigh of relief . It flashed through her mind that whenever Carlo was away from Pina he telephoned her every day , and she did not see how he could do that from Austria . But he must have met that contingency somehow ; Harriet dared not let herself think of everything . When he saw her next day standing beside her little car at the garage which was closed for the lunch interval , looking exactly as though she were waiting for a mechanic , he could have shouted for joy . In those pants and boots and a fur-hooded parka she was a sight to see . Her figure was that tantalizing thing , legs and hips slender as a boy 's , feminine in their grace and in the contradiction which made no sight , when it was perfect , more exciting . Her face glowed inside the frame of spiky fur , her eyes were rapturous , and when he drove the Ferrari to the edge of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " Oh , come here , come here ! " he cried , pulling her to him and running to a corner back of the service shed , where they were out of sight of the road . " Oh , Dio ! " and they embraced as if they would never have the opportunity again . " You are more128 129MARCIA DAVENPORTbeautiful than ever , more beautiful than  --  oh ! my God , I am mad , I am wild with joy ! " " You are beautiful yourself , " she said , smiling at him , surprisedthat she could keep tears of delight from her eyes . He was bareheaded , dressed also in ski-pants and a black windbreakerjacket , its open neckline filled with a dark red scarf . " Harriet , cara ! Amore mio ! " " I ca n't believe it . Oh , I 'm so happy . " " Tell me , tell me everything . " " Everything . " Presently they went back to the cars . Carlo moved Harriet 's things into the Ferrari and fastened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locked her car and left it parked while they went to a Gasthof and ate thick tasteless soup and veal and potatoes and spinach and dark bread and huge pieces of cheese , sitting close together in a dark corner , talking , talking , in words and without words , and drinking a bottle of Dole . When they got back to the garage the man was there and Harrietwaited in the Ferrari while Carlo took her keys and went to arrange something . He had his own tank filled , and they started for Landeck . " What did you do about my bug ? " she asked him . " Arranged with the man there to drive it down to Lecco on Monday . " " Oh , lovely . " So they could be together almost all the way back . The road was clear , there was not in fact much snow on the level ground , but Harriet said that the skiing had been excellent , although the weather was looking doubtful now . It was grey and might probably snow ; it might even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE CONSTANT IMAGE " And suppose it is ? " said Carlo . " We could n't ski , " she said , like a child reciting a lesson . " And what would we do ? " " I do n't know  --  teacher . You must tell me . " " Shall I tell you ? " " Not unless you want me to have a fit . Seriously , do you think we 'll be all right at Lech ? " He nodded . " It 's still January . Nobody else will be quite as smart as we are except perhaps some royalty who want to be incognito . Only the best skiers go there anyway and then later than this . " " Have you been there before ? " " Once . It is magnificent , the best I ever saw . " " I know , I 've heard about it at St. Anton . But I 'm worried about the weather . " " We can risk that . I do n't think we have to risk people . They do n't get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ March . " " I know . But going through St. Anton I 'm going to lie down in that hole in the back . Somebody may be there . " " It may be getting dark by then . But I am not going to worry about anything . I want to enjoy you in peace . " If there is such a thing , she thought . They were approaching the frontier . " Why do you suppose this last stretch of road is so terrible ? " she said . " You 'd never know you were in Switzerland . " She watched him weaving the car along the unpaved single lane , stopping at the turn-outs if he had to , and bumping over the frozen ruts . The road was cut in a narrow shelf between the mountains on their left and the steep ravine on their right with the frozen River Inn lead-coloured at the bottom . " At least the road is frozen now  --  but have you ever done it when it was pure mud ? " 130 131MARCIA DAVENPORT " Would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been like this but I expect they were particularly satisfied with it in Mr. H 's day . " But on the Austrian side the road was wide , fine and new , and he could make time . They marvelled at the tunnels of the Flexenpass , as well done as the Gardesana , Carlo said ; and the Austriaci do a good job of keeping this road cleared . It was not quite dark when they came over the top of the pass and down into the valley where the village of Lech with its broad , low houses and cheerful lights , all but buried in snow , greeted them with the charm of a Christmas card . " Heaven ! " said Harriet , her eyes sparkling . " Utter heaven . " And Carlo had not told her about the enchanting Postgasthof where he had taken the Bemelmans rooms , dear to the writerartistwhose family home this was , the bathroom walls of the suite painted by him with a whimsical itinerary of his travels . There was a fire in the little sitting-room , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child in her delight . " I ca n't believe it , " she said over and over again . " It ca n't be true , it 's too perfect . " It bore no relation to anything that was part of his world or of hers ; it was a separate one for them to share wholly and alone . In the morning when they opened their eyes , buried in goosedownand bliss , they looked at the closed shutters and then at each other . " Shall we look ? " " Let 's get the suspense over . " He went to a window and opened the shutters . From the bed Harriet saw only that the sky was cloudy but Carlo said , " Too good to be true . It has snowed in the night , a light powdering . Perhaps four or five centimetri  --  Dio ! how lucky we are . " THE CONSTANT IMAGE " Oh , how heavenly . They 'll know downstairs what it 's goingto do , too . " " Speaking of downstairs I shall go down ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had their breakfast , sitting up in the two low beds pushed close together . Carlo whenever he moved in the night had been giving the three-piece mattress the rough edge of the foulest oaths he knew , cursing tedeschi of every stripe from the Rhine to the Danube , and fighting the short , square featherbed which warmed either his feet or his shoulders , but not both . " But I am here , " she said , " and we have better ways of keepingwarm . " " That 's just the point , " he growled . " It 's the principle of the thing . Imbecili ! Cretini ! The only part of me this damned thing warms is the part that does n't need it ! " and he threw it on the floor . Laughing , Harriet retrieved it later , for the room was cold . She pinned the two featherbeds end to end with safety pins and this covered them in one bed completely . " And how can you eat all that stuff ? " he exclaimed , watching her calmly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cups of coffee with hot milk . He had eaten a bit of a roll and gulped some coffee , saying , " Augh ! " She giggled , she had never seen him so violently Italian . " Austrian coffee is good of its sort , and you know it , " she said . " And I need this when I 'm skiing . Besides , I  --  " and she put her face down to her cup , knowing she was blushing . What a thing to do , what a time to feel like a bashful child . He roared . " Of course it makes one hungry ! " She looked at his share of the huge tray . " Oh , " he said , " Me  --  my appetite is special . " He leered. 132 133MARCIA DAVENPORT " Go away , " she said , pushing him gently . " Go and get dressed . We want to get out . " He came back to report that he believed they had nothing to worry about . It was a small place , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name he had ever seen before , also no Englishor American one . " I should n't mind for myself , " she said , lacing her boots . " People practically expect this sort of thing in my situation . " " You are perfectly sure , " he asked as he had last night , " that you really want to start off with the Rufikopf ? " " Absolutely . " She beamed at him . It was the toughest peak there was , in principle only skimastersdid it ; but she knew about it and she said , " I 'm in practice . There 's no better time than now , suppose it snows all tomorrow ? " It rose straight up like a crag-topped wall behind the village ; the Seilbahn , the lift , was only a few steps from the hotel . He watched her face as they were going up in it . She was interesting to him in a new way ; she sat looking up at the peak , then followingthe drop with her eye in a practised , appraising manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they said a word now and then but she was not really thinking about him . They heard someone saying that the peak was nine hundred metres above the village ; over twenty-seven hundred feet , she thought , as they stepped out . The drop before them was almost perfectly sheer for half its length ; then the slope turned more gradual as it broadened out and swept down to the level of the valley . " Who first ? " said Carlo . " You say . " " No , you . " THE CONSTANT IMAGE " Okay , I 'll go . " She fastened her skis quickly , took her long poles , and without a trace of hesitation stood poised to start . He watched her closely . There was relaxed precision about everything she did which bespoke the expert in a degree inapplicable to most women . She must be very good . She sniffed with excitement and with a motion almost casual in its ease , she moved off on her left ski . God almighty ! he breathed ; but the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they stayed together as he watched her go straight down the sheer drop . Could she ? She slammed straight down until , just before he could bear it no longer , his heart bumping in his chest , she began to wedeln , checking her speed ; he stood open-mouthed , watching her little behind moving like a pendulum in short rays , with perfect synchronizationof hips and knees . Her track was like feather-stitchingin the new snow , dotted by the pricks of her poles ; he had never seen a more perfect one . Past the steep drop she swept round in a perfect parallel and a dust of snow and stood looking up waiting for him to join her . He had never had such a thrill . He had seen the Olympic women and she was fully in their class , the best , in fact , that he had ever seen. 134 135  --   --  Ip *-  --  **ONE day was sunny and the sky was blue , which gave their pleasure the last scintilla of perfection . They had not been so greedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time the sky was grey but they were lost in a quality of bliss so extreme that they told each other many times , " This is impossible . It ca n't be real . It ca n't be true . " " Indeed , " said Carlo , " life is not like this and so we must consider that we have gone to another world or another incarnation , where time is suspended and nothing has any reality except this  --  " he touched her face  --  " how beautiful you are , how extraordinaryeverything you do . " " You are the same for me . " " And we have shut out everything in the universe except each other and a minor concern whether the big snowfall will hold off . It is fantastic . " " You mean , " she said , " you have never had such an experiencebefore ? " Her eyes were incredulous . He thought for a moment before answering . They were sitting in their own corner of the Stiiberl downstairs , on the paddedbench surrounding the big green tile stove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day . The place had the **25;2305;TOOLONG of the Austrian Landhaus , its walls studdedwith antlers , its beams and wainscot , tables and benches of dark polished wood , its little leaded casements with embroideredcurtains , its floor pocked by the spikes of mountain shoes . It smelt of beer and frying onions and beeswax and the dry sprucewood burning in the stove . Carlo spoke finally . " No . I have never had such an experience before . For one thing , I have not known a woman like you . There is no other . " " Amore mio , " she murmured , " it only seems so . " She felt tearful and drove the feeling away , smiling . " If there are others , then they are probably Americans too , " he said , " and I should never have thought I would like that . A woman as a rule should not  --  " he paused and motioned to the barmaid to fill their glasses . " She should not do things too well . " " Ca n't there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little specialty of her own ? " " Well , one . " He rolled his eyes . " But you  --  " he threw up his hands . " And I like it . It pleases me . It interests me . I would never have believed it . " " It is nothing , " she murmured , " except we please each other . " " Besides , you are intelligent . This too is new to me . You know perfectly well , I do n't have to tell you , I 've had a horror of intelligentwomen . They are bores . " " I do n't know anything , " she said mournfully . " I did n't even go to college and most American women  --  girls  --  do . " " And does it give them anything you have not got ? I tell you , they are pretentious bores . While you  --  you have learnt something . You know something . " " In recent weeks , perhaps yes . The real test whether I 've learnt anything is  --  you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 137MARCIA DAVENPORTwhispered , " Carlo , sometimes I 'm afraid to go back . Back to Milano  --  or to anywhere . " He leaned back , stretching his legs and looking at the toes of his gaudy red and white slipper-socks . He smoked his cigarette to the end and crushed it out in the pottery ash-tray . He turned his head to look at her . " You had no child when you were married , " he said slowly . " Why ? " " I  --  it 's hard to explain in a way . It would n't have made sense . " " And did it make sense as it was ? " She shook her head . " You were not living life , " he said . " You were married but you were not accepting the fact that marriage is what it is . It is not this which you and I have , " he said , touching her cheek tenderly . " This is also part of life , and it is not marriage . Marriageis nothing without children . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what marriage should have been , you were afraid then too . " " I suppose I was , " she said softly . " I had n't thought of it that way . " " And you must not be afraid now . You have no physical fear , you are phenomenal in that way . Why should you have any other ? You must not be afraid of anything , afraid of the world or of going back to it , because that too would mean you were afraid to live and that can not be true of you now . You have grown too much for any more of that . " She was spellbound . This was a Carlo whom she had not known at all . In the light of his tastes and his habits and his capers it was almost unbelievable . She put her chin on her folded hands and gazed at him with the clear eyes he adored . THE CONSTANT IMAGE " I could not imagine being married to you , " she said , " even though we are in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is right , " he said . " Any such idea would be completely unrealistic . If you could imagine it , or were trying to , it would mean that you were still a child , and children fear many things which we do not . I too , I love to be with you , I want to be with you all the time , I can not get enough of you . But I am not going to spoil that by confusing it with anything else , or by being afraid to live it for what it is ; and I am not going to let you be afraid if I can help it . " " Oh , you are wonderful , " she said . Her eyes were full of tears . " I did n't know . . . I did n't realize ... " He shook his head slowly . " I am not wonderful , amore mio . I am a man , a very sinful man , guilty of unkindness and selfishnessand many things that I am ashamed of . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eh , I said you are intelligent . Come , " he said , with a flashingchange of mood . " It is past time for another of those epicureanAbendplatten snit Kompott oder gemischtem Salat  --  my God , my God , no wonder the tedeschi are what they are . " " People eat mostly frozen food in my country , " she said . " And that is what makes you such an icicle in bed . Andiamo . " The next day , their last of skiing , he had a silly collision on a level stretch with a youth who turned unexpectedly , and in falling Carlo sprained his right wrist . " It is nothing , " he said in their room , while Harriet bathed it with hot and cold water ; but they saw that it was beginning to swell . More because he wanted to avoid explanations at home than because of the pain , he consented when she insisted he let the doctor come to look at it . The doctor strapped it up and said it would be all right in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it as138 139MARCIA DAVENPORTlittle as possible . When the doctor had gone Carlo scratched his head and made a face . " I suppose the driving tomorrow would not be good for it , " he said . Harriet was silent , looking at him with an apologetic little smile . He shrugged . " Would you hate it if I drove ? " she asked . " Of course not . You shall , " he said , but she saw him wonderinghow she would handle his car , which was a very expensive custom body mounted on the Ferrari chassis , only slightly modifiedfrom the racing car . She thought better of begging him not to worry , that did seem pretentious . Their last night was yet another revelation in a broadening sphere of wonders , profound with contrasts and the interweavingof mood and feeling , action and reaction , tumult and stillness . Their relation had changed and deepened in quality and expressionand in the acts and the words which could sweep from outrageousplay to hushed solemnity . They were wholly at ease , more than intimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given up the futility of abjuring the words she wanted to say , and he the pretense that he did not feel for her what he did . Both knew what this portended in the short weeks to come but Carlo had shown how they must meet it and that was what they would do . The fat chambermaid came pounding in with their breakfast at six o'clock as they had ordered , and Carlo went as usual to look at the weather . It was still dark and from the look of his back , standing there with arms akimbo ( why do only Italian men do that , she thought ) she knew what was happening . " Snowing , " she said . " Corpo d'un dio . Maledizione . Che porcheria . " " Why ? Shut the window , love , it 's cold . So it 's snowing  --  think how lucky it has n't broken until today . " 140THE CONSTANT IMAGE " With three hundred kilometri to drive ? God knows what we 'll find in the Maloja . " " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing . " For himself that was true , he thought , but for her ? Well , the hell with his wrist if he thought he ought to drive . He would see . He saw at once . She did not ask a question . She had observed everything while riding with him , the gear-shift , the controls , the unfamiliar instruments . She adjusted the driver 's seat , warmed up the motor gently , turned on the lights and the windscreenwipers . The snow was falling thickly enough to keep a curtain steadily across the road but he saw that she was perfectly relaxed ; she backed out into it without a swerve or a spin of the wheels . " It is n't slippery , just thick , " she said , and little else for a long time . She was wearing soft suede boots with rubber soles and her feet were as light and accurate as a cat 's . She sensed in a moment the right balance between a safe speed and the compression-ratioof the engine which normally made a very high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he relaxed and sat smoking , looking at her every few minutes and admittingwith his eyebrows and shoulders that there was nothing to do about this woman but concede that she could do superbly what women had no business doing , and make him take delight in her doing it . For some reason it intensified her femininity . " And it does n't come easily , " he muttered once , but she had either not heard him or pretended not to . At Martina the Swiss frontier guard told them that chains were necessary in the Malojaand they both nodded and said yes ; but when they started again she laughed and said , " I bet you have n't got chains . " " Chains , " he snorted . She would have carried them for the places he drove in winter , but they did flourish their bravado so ! 141MARCIA DAVENPORTShe was perfectly cool the twenty kilometres of vile onetrackroad , turning off or backing unconcernedly into a turn-out when they met the trucks which always had work to do up here . When they reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clouds were down so low that there was no visibility at all . The surface was slippery with grainy snow frozen as it fell . She slowed down and said , " Does my driving make you nervous , Carlo ? Do you want to go down this yourself ? " " No , " he said . There was an odd note in his voice . " I want to see you do it . " He does n't like it , she thought , and if I 'm going to do anything to discredit myself this is where it will be . She went down as she would have done had she been alone , with extreme care , probably with much more caution than he would use , she supposed . Not until she was at each one could she discern the markers on the right by which to gauge her place , and not at all the red mid-line of the road . She knew the pass well and she had so much natural road-sense that she felt the serpentines in the rhythm that skilled drivers know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by judicious choice of the lower gears . They got below the cloud-line more than halfway down but the grainy snow was still falling and she was still wary of it . When the road flattened out before Castasegna the snow turned to streaming rain and when they stopped at the Chiavenna frontier Carlo sat surveying the sodden chill of his native land and burst into a roar of laughter , saying " Bell'Italia piena di sole ! " " Anyway , " said Harriet , " we can have coffee in that bar over there . Coffee , Carlo ! Bell'Italia ! " " And a grappa to toast an amazing driver . " " Oh , come , do n't be silly . Anybody can do that . " " Any American ? " THE CONSTANT IMAGE " I suppose so . " " Do you know that you 've driven the entire way without touching the brakes ? " " Well , my goodness , " she said in English , " what kind of damn fool would ? " Angela was glad to see her , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of letters and messages which she saw as the most immediate of several devices for keeping busy ; she had been telling herself on the way in alone from Lecco how essential that would be . Be occupied , keep busy , see more people , keep the time filled if it only means running about spending money in the shops . But keep busy and do n't yearn , do n't dream , do n't maunder , do n't think if you can manage not to . Oh , it is not difficult at all to tell oneself what to do . The question is , how well can one hope to do it ? While Angela hurried about , disposing of luggage and runningher bath , Harriet went to the sitting-room with her hands full of letters , to get accustomed to being here again . She stopped with a little gasp in the doorway . The room was filled with flowers , the pale roses that he always sent , sprays of lovely white lilac from Holland , a faience tub in the corner with a tall plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , moist and caressing ; she stood breathing it , her eyes filmed with tears . He had known how she would feel to find herself alone again , he knew everything , he understood the all-gone sensation which she was determined to keep at bay . And how could he have man-142 143MARCIA DAVENPORTaged this , he could only have arrived in Milano a little while before she had , driving in from Lecco in sheets of rain . It was past nine o'clock now . The darling , she thought , smiling weakly at his ridiculous objection to her calling him that , when it meant as much to her as if she had invented a whole new language to express what she felt for him , which at the same time shut out every other being on earth . This was not going to be easy ; but his tenderness , added to all he had said that evening at Lech , was fortification much greater than she had expected in the beginning . She had needed no admonition that to be in this situation with a man like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great pain of final parting when it came . She knew well that she had to face an intervening series of little deaths but she was surprised to find that he understood and was trying to soften their impact . It never occurred to her to wonder whether he was feeling the same pangs , he was so supremely practised and wise about all this . He telephoned then for an instant , to make sure she had got home and to reassure her with a word of love ; but he could not speak , he whispered , when she tried to thank him for the flowers ; he would ring her as usual in the morning . She wondered with anxiety if Pina were already at home and had seen him arrive in ski-clothes ; most probably not , he was merely surrounded by his household . His children would long since have been in bed . He had mitigated some of the odious conspiratorialfeeling for Harriet by not discussing Pina 's plans , but it was obvious that Carlo had arranged to arrive home ahead of Pina , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her without betraying his whereabouts . Oh , it is all so complicated and I do wish I had n't . . . no , you do n't ! she answered herself . You do n't wish anything of the sort . You areTHE CONSTANT IMAGEmad about him and you are prepared to see this through . She put her face into the cool yellow cloud of powdery blossom , drinking in their scent , then she went to her room and got ready for bed . And it proved a little easier than she had hoped to keep the days crowded . She blessed her pleasant new friends for their spontaneous hospitality and the readiness with which they suggestedthis thing to do or that . She decided to give another cocktail ' early in March , like the one she had given in December , as the only practicable way to reciprocate so much kindness . She became aware that Tia Ortolani was inviting her oftener and seeing more of her than anyone but Lydia ; and when the reason dawned on her , beyond that of Carlo 's friendship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asking him . He came now every day in the late afternoon , and stayed until almost eight . They never felt ready to be parted when the moment came for him to leave , but Harriet sped him away with the gayest smile , the lightest touch , she could muster . Often they met later in public , at some evening party or at La Scala ; they took the most elaboratecare never to be apart together , never to say a word that was not intended to be overheard . It was a trying feat , but only a real fool could fail to carry it off . Harriet knew quite as well as Carlo that they were deceiving nobody . The luxury of relaxing into verbal and human intimacy , beyond all the rest , was a lifesavingrespite ; and at such a time she could ask a question like the one about Tia Ortolani . If anything , he was pleased . " You see ? " he said . " I told you , you are intelligent . Yes , what you think was true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older than I am , nearly ten years older . She was very unhappy about something that Rinaldo did , and this was also before I knew him very well . It was long before I was married . For this reason , ifMARCIA DAVENPORTPina knows it at all , and I suppose she does , she does not hate Tia as she does  --  " he shrugged . " Certain other women . And , of course , me . " " Cara , Pina will not indulge in any overt hatred of you now . She keeps more controlled than that . Pina only allows herself to hate when  --  " he stopped speaking and lighted a cigarette . When he has lost interest in a woman , Harriet told herself with a suppressed shudder . For an instant she saw him from Pina 's view . In that light he was heartless , he was cruel , he was selfish . She drew her hand across her eyes as if to shut out the equally horrible idea of how he appeared to women whom he had dropped . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with some of them , his gratitude to Tia Ortolani was as gentle and real as his tenderness to Pina herself , to his children , to his mother , to Harriet . It was when she thought of his mother and his children that Harriet knew him capable of real love ; just what he felt for his wife , for Harriet ; what he had ever felt for any woman with whom he was amorously involved , she did not think herself wise enough to say . She had a certain sense of stability with him for the moment , but the moment was bounded by the first of April when her lease would terminate and she would go away  --  for the best , she knew , even while it wrung her heart . She was surprised by an invitation to luncheon from Carlo 's mother , and even more surprised after she had accepted , when Carlo told her that he and Pina were not to be there . Zio Andrea146THE CONSTANT IMAGEwas there , the dear old gentleman with the beautiful white hair and moustache ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their eighteen-year-old son who was so like Carlo that Harriet almost gasped to see the same beauty in its pristine form , a man indeed and not a boy , but a clear slate with everythingyet to be written upon it . The party was completed by an elderly Marchese Boninsegna and his marchesa , patrician people with fine aquiline heads and courtly manners , whose conversation was the most interesting that Harriet had heard in Italy . He was one of the great bibliophiles of Europe , known everywhere for his library and his scholarship . Harriet found herself wonderingabout the origin of this friendship which was somewhat uncharacteristicof the alignment of groups and classes as she had seen them ; it was not equality of birth or community of intellectualor social interests which explained the warm and obviouslylong-standing affection between the Boninsegna and Signora Nora . Gradually through fragments of talk less erudite than that about books and art and history Harriet came to grasp what the bond was . It was philanthropy . She had heard little up to now of this , intrinsic to a tradition and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she had seen of good works were a few big parties and entertainments for the benefit of one charity or another , where the women appeared in gowns and furs whose prices would have maintained the beneficiary of the occasion for months on end ; exactly the same thing as the theatre parties and balls which filled the winter in New York , run by committees of fashionable women  --  or those who strove to be  --  amongst whom Harriet 's mother considered her presence important . Everything about these people and this setting was different . There was a dark , dowdy heaviness about Signora Nora 's house147MARCIA DAVENPORTwhich at the same time was infinitely pleasant . The luncheon table was in the old-fashioned family style , covered by a polished damask cloth laid over a thick pad ; the Ginori china , like the silver and the glass , was discreetly ornate and of the very best quality ; a chandelier hung low over the oval table around which two solemn elderly menservants in dark livery and white gloves moved in silent procession , serving perfect , classic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this glimpse of Carlo 's old home but by its contrast to the house in Bergamo ; and had she not known it already , she would have understood that SignoraNora was the real Milanese in the Dalverio amalgam , the daughter of long-established bourgeois wealth derived from and reinvested in banking , industry , and  --  Harriet had heard recently  --  hydroelectricpower . There was a late **25;2332;TOOLONG about her house , her looks , her voice , her guests , for they spoke with a certain elegance of phrase and an idiom different from the crisp babble which Harriet heard elsewhere , just as the big luxurious flat of Carlo and Pina , with its beautiful , expensive decor , its shimmer of pale colours , crystal , and dramaticlighting was the quintessence of the best present-day taste . In the drawing-room as they rose , about to take their leave , the Marchese paused before a large photograph which stood alone on a table , Carlo 's father , for here were the eloquent eyes , the masterful mouth , the fine lean cheeks , tempered and sensitizedby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SignoraNora 's forearm and said in an undertone , " I think of him always , my brave , dear friend . " Harriet looked away , reluctant to intrude , apprised by a few words of the identity and nature of the men who had quietly risked their lives for conscience and decency . She found herself alone for a moment with her hostess , as148THE CONSTANT IMAGEthe Boninsegna departed . Holding the hand of Signora Nora for an instant longer than the clasp of leave-taking , Harriet said , " Thank you so much , Signora Nora . " She looked into the wise dark eyes as she had once imagined doing , and she said , " I shall be leaving Milano in a few weeks . " She paused and saw with reliefthat the implication of her words was fully perceived . There was no change in Signora Nora 's expression , it was bent upon Harriet with severe gravity . " May I come and see you before Igo ? " " Any time , Signora , " said Carlo 's mother ; and for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before starting her car , staring at nothing . If she had wondered on arriving why she had been invited , she knew all too well now. 149+ II ***** " CAN it be only seven weeks ? " said Carlo . He put out his hand and laid it on Harriet 's cheek , holding it still while she turned her head slowly until her lips brushed his fingers . " Only seven weeks of this we have had ? It seems a lifetime . " " Like a jail sentence ? " she said with a shaky laugh . " Oh , stupidina , you know what I mean . " They were leaning on the balustrade of the terrace overlooking the lake at the Marchisis ' house at Bellagio . This was anothercontrivance , one of so many that the details of some were becoming confused in retrospect with those of others . Yesterday they had been at Bergamo again and today Carlo was supposed to have gone from there to Cremona on business . If the matter at Cremona really required his presence , he said , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one day soon . But this was the third week of February , the fog was tapering off , and there would be no reason  --  no opportunity , he said wryly  --  to stay overnight when next he went to Bergamo . " I know , " said Harriet . " It feels as though things were closing in on us . " " If we could only go skiing once more ! " But they could not , for it was the height of the season everyTHECONSTANT IMAGEwhere , and unless they could go very far away , farther than the Dolomites , the Engadine , the Arlberg , the Valle d'Aosta , the Apennines , they were sure to encounter people they knew . Carlo could find no way of stealing the time that a greater distancewould entail and still , no matter how far they might go , there was risk . In sheer frustration he had thought of something so preposterous as proposing to Pina a long week end at Cortina and manoeuvering for Harriet the deferred invitation that she had declined before , but second and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in any case would not have concurred , he knew now ; he was becoming uneasy about Pina for the first time in his life . She was still polite , still very correct ; she had not invitedHarriet for some time past , but such meetings in any group of people move in random sequence ; weeks can elapse without gatherings at a certain house after there have been many in succession . They still met elsewhere , and Pina 's extraordinary imperturbabilitywas unchanged  --  at least , he believed , so far as Harriet or most others could discern . But he knew how to interpretwhat he saw in certain people 's eyes : the scorn and reproach of the Verocchi , the mean threat in the rat 's beads of that hatefulMinghetti woman , the worry and sorrow in the wise eyes of his mother . He knew too that the crux of their censure was not so much his infidelity as his choosing a northern woman , an American particularly , who would never understand the rules , written and unwritten , of the code . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire in the brush-clad slopes of a mountain in dry weather ; if there were any way other than renouncingHarriet , he knew he could stamp them out before they spread beyond control . But he was not going to renounce Harrietand so he had to risk the spreading of a brush-fire , fed by150 151MARCIA DAVENPORT the dry plants of fear and jealousy and malice and spite . And Harriet , even before she was to leave Milano , might get burnt ; he knew who the few friends were who would fight the fire and do their best to shield her , but those would be nothing against the legion who would ally themselves with the Verocchi and make her position untenable . He must not let her stay until any such crisis threatened her . And he must not let her know that he was worried . He must not let her know anything , in- deed , more than she could sense by instinct ; above all he must not let her know what she meant to him . For he could hardly believe it himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overhung the little harbour of Loppia , with its sleepy boat basin and the collection of fauns and swans , urns , cherubs , and care- fully damaged copies of statuary which were lying out to weather in the stone-cutter 's yard . It was high noon of a heav- enly day ; a north wind in the night had burnished the mountains , sharpening their outlines , deepening the shadows of their purple velvet robes , brightening to blinding brilliance their capes and crowns of snow . The water was dark dazzling sapphire , glitter- ing and live with whitecaps , the shores the freshest green of spring . Each cypress stood out like a thick dark pencil sharpened to an artist 's point . They walked slowly along the soft green slope , where lemon-coloured primulas bloomed in clumps amidst their furry leaves , and Harriet cried " Oh , Carlo ! look ! " as they came upon some violets in a sheltered spot . She stooped to pick them , and then some primulas , making as they moved along a lit- tle bouquet which she carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's butler , when he asked if they thought it warm enough to have their aperitivi out here . He would put the Si- 152 gnora 's flowers in water at once but , he asked apologetically , had she looked to see if there were ants ? " Oh , no , " she laughed . " Surely not ants at this time of year ? " " At any time , there are ants , Signora , " he said , bringing out two basket chairs and placing a low table between them . " It is a beautiful day , " he said , with the delight which all these people took in every detail of their weather , their landscape , their world . He had never lived anywhere else , nor had his wife Giovanna the cook , nor the gardener and his family nor , said Carlo , laughing , any of the few thousands of people who had populated this promontory since the time of the highly disputablePliny who had evidently managed to inhabit more places  --  " and for all I know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " But George Washington was not Italian , " said Harriet , making a mouth . " And so he did not use beds as the rest of us do , one sees . " Luigi poured glasses of Carpano for them and hovered for a moment , sniffing the air . " It is not prudent to sit outside so early in the year , Signora , " he said . " One takes cold . " " Only for a little while , Luigi . The sun is so glorious . We sha n't sit out again after luncheon . " " Per bacco , we sha n't , " said Carlo when the man had gone . " No wonder Lydia loves this place so much . She says she 'd like to live here the year round . " " Well , Sandro would not ; and Lydia if she is wise will live as Sandro prefers because he is no more special than the rest of us . But they are lucky to have these servants here all the time . That 's unusual for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was an old retainer , but Lydia 's household here had been established since the war . Harriet did not say so , but she knew that Lydia had insured this comfort from the first by buying Luigi away from one of the hotels where , as head waiter , he had earned enough during the season to hibernate peacefully the other half of the year , doing a little smuggling on the side . " Do n't you ever open your house up at Guello ? " she asked . She turned her head to look up and back towards the top reaches of the mountains which divide the lake into its two long arms . Carlo shrugged . " Pina does not like it . It is old-fashioned , it was my father 's house . Mamma uses it sometimes . And we used to come occasionally in the spring or the autumn when the childrenwere small , but there 's not much for them to do there . They adore Santa Margherita in the summer . " " Do you ? " He looked at her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfamiliar way and he said , " I did . I used to like many things that I shall hate when  --  " his eyes narrowed as if to shut out a bitter prospect  --  " I no longer have you . " " Oh , God , " she breathed . He turned sharply in his chair and said , " Harriet ! Amore mio ! Must you go so far away ? " " After the first of April ? " " After the first of April . " ( And pray God , not before , he thought . ) " Oh , my love , have n't we managed not to talk about it ? " " Managed , yes . But think ? In this sense , " he said roughly , " I have never thought . But now , now I do . " His eyes had the dull look of despair which told her that he would suffer as much as154she when they had to part . She had never really believed it before . She clung to his hand , holding her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tears . All afternoon they lay in the shaded room which she had come to feel was almost her own , so fond had she become of it since last September when she had settled there for her long visit with Lydia . She told this to Carlo , and added , " Now that we are together here it will mean so much more . Everything , in fact . " " Cara , do n't think already in terms of memories . " " I try not to . But also I have to think that way , in order to keep my footing . I tell you , I will be realistic . " " And that means you will go straight back to New York when  --  " She wound her arms round him and lay so close that he had to strain to hear her words , whispered against his shoulder . " Sha n't I have to ? " she said . " You know that the first of April is none too soon for me to leave Milano . And go where people think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . When he spoke his voice was dull , he spoke in a tone that she had never heard before ; even as she listened , she thought remotely , this is without authority , this is beyond his control . He said , " My love , my dearest . Could you not go somewhere else , some place where I could see you ? Paris  --  London  --  " And how , she managed not to say , could you always be flying to Paris or London or anywhere at all ? She only clung to him without answering . " Need you go to America ? " he said . " All that way  --  after the first of April ? " She raised her head and braced herself on one elbow , looking at his face . She tried to speak , choked , rallied , and forced out15SMARCIA DAVENPORTthe words . " By that time , beloved , " she said , " I think I may have to get out of your life or something terrible could happen . " So she does know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hiding anything ? But the only wise measure against worry and dread was to keep them at bay with any means at their command . It seemed to Harriet that never in her life had she really laughed before , for such irresistible reason as Carlo 's nonsense and pranks , and even without any reason when they looked at each other , makingowls ' eyes over some hopeless aspect of their situation , and bursting into boisterous laughter because they knew that if they did not laugh they might be tempted to weep . Harriet had been right when she said it seemed as though things were closing in on them . Carlo did not mention Pina but he did not need to . It was enough to watch his face when he made some suggestionthat they devise a way to go to one place or another for twenty-four hours within the scope of a business trip of his ; and then to see the curtain of frustration which dulled the depth and sparkle of his eyes when he dismissed his own idea as impossible . Harriet understood that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a time when Carlo was , that no feint could insure protection if Pina should yield at last to the furious impulse to inform herself as to Harriet 's whereabouts . It was with burning retrospective shame that Harriet faced this . There came to her mind from the limbo partly of real oblivion and partly of wilful forgetfulness the memory of herTHECONSTANT IMAGEself not so many years ago , savagely tracking down some woman with whom Norton Piers was involved , using any means that came to mind , informants knowing and unknowing , the telephone in all its deviations from false wrong numbers to false names and messages ; yielding to the drive of desperate jealousy and icily sure she was within her rights . Nothing in Pina 's conducthad yet suggested that she would resort to the same devices but Pina was a jealous woman , jealous by nature and surely by this time , jealous of Harriet Piers to the verge of frenzy . Where Harriet had once marvelled at Pina 's phenomenal poise , her amazing discipline and bitterly acquired wisdom , she now marvelledthat there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brink of catastrophe and Carlo , if he grasped this , no longer attempted to reassure her . Pina , he had always said , will do nothing so long as she feels the ground is firm beneath her feet ; what then had happened to make Harriet sense that that ground was beginning to crumble ? She began to feel torn between the prospective agony of parting from Carlo , and the wish , as desperate , she thought , as the death-wish that one could not escape hearing about in these harassed times , to get the whole thing over with , to get away and be done with this Milano and all that had happened to her here . But whether she lay in transports in Carlo 's arms , or whether she exchanged an imperceptible glance with him across a room full of people , she lived with the truth which he himself had stated in the moment of surrender that he had fought off not only in the case of Harriet but in his whole life before . The measure of its power and its awful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own language to hers , and saying quietly , " This is love , real love , because it is recognition , not infatuation . " "  --  that we have always known each other , " she said. 156 157MARCIA DAVENPORT "  --  that it is true in spite of the fact that we are strangers . " " Strangers  --  ? " " In every way that touches reality . In every way that concernslife outside our private selves . " " And we shall remain such strangers , " she said , while she felt pain as though her heart were shrieking in protest , " as long as we live . " " Perforce , " he said , and closed his eyes because he could not bear to look at hers . So it was by instinct that Harriet knew that the Verocchi had begun to rise up and rally round Pina , re-enclosing Carlo inside the stockade . He had seldom said on leaving her where he was to spend the evening unless they were to meet at some party or occasion , but now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his overcoat or delaying that finality for a last embrace , he might mutter , " Another of those deadly family dinners ! " and with irrepressible mischief , toss off a gesture or a grimace mimicking the long nose of one uncle , the big belly of another , the pious rectitude of Pina 's widowed sister , the bustling authoritativenessof his mother-in-law . And they would look for a moment deep into each other 's eyes and see there the mutual exhortation to courage ; and they would break into peals of laughter . The Ortolani were giving a ball for their daughter Maria Luisa on Shrove Tuesday , which fell at the end of February . It was sure to be a beautiful party and very gay , a party for whichTHE CONSTANT IMAGEto have a new ball gown made , and to get the big jewels out of the bank , which in some cases meant running up to Lugano , since certain families preferred to keep their treasure there . In the preceding fortnight Harriet had followed along with the preparations and arrangements so far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gown and accepted Lydia 's invitation to dine before the ball , in a party of sixteen which Lydia thought out very carefully . But while Lydia was thus occupied , for reasonsso cogent that she shrank from mentioning them , Harriet had been traversing a long road into an ominous country ; and , arrived there , she paused to get her figurative breath and look back from the lonely plateau to see as though in the distance the imminent festivity which she had half forgotten . She was brought back with a thump as Lydia said to her , when they were alone a few days before the party , " Darling , I think you ought to know . " " What ? " asked Harriet , with a nerve ticking in her temple and a wilfully blank look in her eyes which could not fool , but might rebuff Lydia . Lydia sighed and was plainly at a loss for how to answer . But she summoned her courage and said , " Well  --  Pina . " " What has she done ? " Harriet 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She tried to back out of our dinner next Tuesday . She said she preferred to give a small dinner of her own , and perhaps in the end not go to Tia 's ball . Neither she nor Carlo , of course . " " Was this because she does n't want to see me or because she is angry with you ? " " Well  --  both . She was pretty bad with me . She accused me of being treacherous and helping you to be with Carlo  --  of158 159MARCIA DAVENPORTcourse I told her it was n't so . I felt horrible , but we 've been over all that . " " It wo n't be bothering you much longer , " said Harriet with bitterness , " or Pina either . " " Oh , darling , I was so afraid it would be like this . " " It is . And it 's bad . I feel an utter damned fool for letting it happen but I do n't know how to un-happen it  --  except I shall be leaving so soon now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Oh , God , " said Lydia miserably . " Hindsight . " " I 'd much rather not go to the ball myself , " said Harriet . " You can imagine how festive I feel . " " But you must . I told Pina they must , too . I had a hard time persuading her . I do n't know whether she believed me when I swore I had n't covered for you  --  but she 's beginning to lose her grip . And for Pina that would n't mean just a plunge into hysterics . She 'd do something . " Harriet jumped up from her chair and stood at the window looking out at the street along which people were stepping at the brisk pace which was native to New York , but surprising here . The place hummed with the same kind of energy . No wonder she had felt natural here from the first . She turned from the window and stood leaning against the sill , her hands clasped behind her . " Look here , " she said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pina since I met her , have been how cool and tough she is about other women . It 's not so easy for me to face it , but I know stories of some of Carlo 's escapades and how Pina behaved about them . I 've felt like a dog because of her having to put up such a front on account of me . It 's hell , it 's not the kind of thing we 're good at . I could n't have gone on with it if I had n't always knownTHE CONSTANT IMAGEexactly the day when it would end . And she knows too . So why is she suddenly different now ? " Lydia looked at Harriet as though to beg her to use her wits and stop being wilfully obtuse . But Harriet had put herself behindthat barricade for some reason and she was not to be forced out . At last Lydia sighed and said , " Oh , Harriet . If I have n't needed to have the truth about you and Carlo spelt out , if I know it by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? She knows as well as you do that this is different from anything that ever happened to Carlo before . " Harriet said nothing . Lydia said , " If Pina ca n't sense the difference between Carlo in one of his usual affairs and Carlo desperately in love , who could ? Of course she 's beginning to panic  --  she 's phenomenal but she 's not superhuman . And that 's why I 'm terrified she 'll do something . " " What ? " " I do n't know , but if she does it will be a scandal . That 's why you 've all three got to appear at Tia 's ball and do a good job of it . " Harriet swore in a style of Americanese that Lydia had not heard in years . Then she said , " There 's that damned party of mine next Thursday too . " " Of course you 've asked them . " " Of course . Like everybody else I 'm indebted to . " " Well , it 's the same thing . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everybody will be watching you , watching like buzzards . I 've seen other  --  " and Lydia stopped speaking , shuttingher mouth with a sharp breath and looking at Harriet with pain in her lovely eyes . " Go on , " said Harriet , turning her head . " Say it . You were160 161MARCIA DAVENPORTabout to say something about other affairs of Carlo 's  --  " and she shivered . " I just told you , " said Lydia almost in a whisper . " I know this is n't merely an affair , that 's the trouble . Not just what it was meant to be . " " Never mind that , " said Harriet harshly . " It 's too late , the milk is spilt  --  what were you about to say ? " " That when  --  when things have got critical in lots of cases , any case , leave Carlo out for the moment  --  people gather for the kill . They watch and they wait  --  oh , I do n't have to tell you . And this time they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can help it . " Harriet put her cheek on Lydia 's and held her close for a moment . " Darling , I 'm desperately sorry  --  and in a way , ashamed  --  that I 've put you in such a spot . But you are wonderful . " Lydia sighed . " Anyway , we 'll get through Tuesday  --  " " And Thursday . And then I 'll concentrate on getting ready to leave . By the way  --  have you any special cues for me for Tuesday ? " Lydia shook her head . " Just good sense and watch Pina without showing it . And pray . " " I wish I could . Like a lot of other things you 've taken to since you came here . " At the dinner party Harriet sat on the left of Sandro Marchisi , with a young Count Boninsegna on her other side , a nephew of the old Marchese whom she had met at Signora Nora 's . The Count had recently returned from a stay in the United States where he had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West and since he was an ardent sportsman he had been skiing at Sun Valley and Squaw Valley . " And I 've heard about you there , Signora ! " He was delightedTHE CONSTANT IMAGEto have something of this sort to compliment her about . He had heard so much about her wonderful form and the competitions she had won that she began to quake , sick with the thought that he might go to Lech and hear enough more to put all the pieces together . But what would it matter , she thought , it 's so badly torn anyway . Pina was seated at the farther end of the table on the same side as Harriet , to spare them the possibility of seeing each other , and Carlo also far from Harriet on the opposite side . She blessed the Italians , or anyway Lydia , for keeping the English and American custom of the host and hostess at the far ends of the table , instead of facing each other across the centre as in France . Suppose that were done tonight !  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lydia had put Pina beside the Belgian Ambassador on her own right , who had come from Rome for the ball ; and Carlo sat beside Teresa Restelli from Torino , who was young , frighteninglybeautiful , very fast , and married to one of the richest men in Europe . She flirted boldly with Carlo , who led her on just enough to make Lydia hope in despair that all these people were laying their bets that the Restelli would be Carlo 's next flare after the American had gone  --  and perhaps before . How great a fool could Lydia be ?  --  she need only glance at Harriet , finedrawnas a Romney , in a wonderful white and black gown and a diamond necklace all lace and frost , the delicate taste of forty years ago , which made modern blobs and chunks and eyesmackersvulgar by comparison . Her grandmother 's , Lydia knew , and Harriet had always refused to have it reset , like the other pieces in the same style which suited her better than the massive jewellery that she sometimes wore like everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cachet ; and her eyes , wide and clear , 162 163MARCIA DAVENPORTwere set about with so much of the artifice that was today 's mode that one could not tell in a great room like this , under such brilliant lighting , what part of the deep , blended shadows were skill and what the hints of suffering . A lordly staircase is a breath-taking sight , and Harriet as they all moved up the sweep of marble and mosaic at the Ortolani palace , between a double row of flunkies holding lighted tapers in long golden wands , was lifted for a moment from her tense , cautious thrall and transported by sheer enchantment . Flow lovely was the world , she reflected , for which such houses and such dramatic perfection of setting were designed ; how drab and crude today 's life when seen from behind this masque which for an evening had been raised to hide it . Was it possible that men and women two centuries ago had lived their inner lives with the studied sureness and splendour which had framed their outer ones ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stairs ever since this house was built , shaken by the same fears , tortured by the same pangs that I feel now ; and they have moved through the intricacies of evenings like this one , calm , beautiful , mannered , gay . The world changes and it does not change , this one perhaps more positively in each respect than any other I can know ; I am the problematical element , the alien one , and I am not going to betray that when there is so much exquisite precept by which to be guided . She raised her head and came up with a radiant smile to greet the Ortolani at the head of the stairs . The party was sufficiently large to fill the sweep of salons just short of crowding them ; the band was superlative , the champagne also , and the gaiety that capricious intangible which can not be forced , arranged , or insured . Harriet was kept whirlingby a succession of partners  --  and what beautiful dancers they were !  --  but by prearrangement Carlo danced with her hardly at164THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him what had passed between herself and Lydia but she knew that he had guessed it . He had to play a difficult role fraught with pitfalls , as Pina must and Harriet herself , delicately feeling their way amidst the dangersmasked by all these sparkling eyes and smiling faces . Nothingthat they did , well or badly , would deceive anyone . It was part of the very excitement which kept such a party tingling that people knew the tensions which ran like cables buried in the dark conduits of men 's and women 's private selves , carrying the electric charges which could touch off disaster as readily as illumination and delight . Carlo had done his part to dress the ordeal with grace , balancinghis notice of Harriet between perilous extremes , the preposterous feint that he had abruptly ceased his attentions to her , or the crudity of pursuing them as in the beginning , defiant of eyes and opinions and tongues . Each of the few times that he danced with her they had taken only a few steps when one of his intimate friends , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , came up and wafted her away . Carlo then returned to dancing with his dinner partner or with other spectacularly flirtatious beauties ; occasionally with Pina ; and Harriet when she glimpsed him with the former caught herself thinking that if he could divert Pina 's alarm from herself by making love to one of them , she would thank God on her knees for it . And I , she remembered , I used to be jealous ! Lydia did not dance much , but sat like a minor queen holding court from a golden divan in a corner , her blonde beauty refulgentand unique even amidst such a redundance of beauty . It required only a glance between them now and then to inform Harriet that all was well , that people 's attention had long since spread over the kinescope of the whole party and that for to-165MARCIA DAVENPORTnight at least nobody would listen for the mute triangle in the human orchestra unless someone should be so blundering as to strike the instrument maliciously . The supper passed off well , a buffet of edible works of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and afterwards Lydia availed herself of her faintly visible madonna-like state to move towards departure . It was past three o'clock . They had agreed that they would leave together and when Harriet , dancing with Roberto Boninsegna , saw Lydia rise , she asked him to take her over to join the Marchisi . " Oh please ! " he said , " not yet . Do n't go now . I shall be enchantedto take you home . " But Harriet did not mean to stay without Lydia . " Well , " she said , " we must anyway say good night to them , " and she noted thankfully that she had not seen the Dalveri since an instant at supper when Pina 's eyes , the onetime eyes of amber velvet , had lain upon her with the flat glasslike stare of a lioness . Harriet , laughing and chatting with a group of people , turned her head to reply to some bit of banter , grasping the excuse to evade that baleful glance ; but now as she moved with the Marchisi and young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she saw that Carlo and Pina , coming from the opposite direction , would reach the stairs at the same moment . This she had not counted upon . She had feared in any case to make herself conspicuous by leaving early , when the ball would go on until broad daylight . But she and Lydia had planned to drift away together , and any revision of their idea could only be communicated by telepathy . The two groups converged where it was impossible to avoid meeting and Lydia said , laughing , " I 've overstayed my leave . I was given until two o'clock , and look at Cinderella now . " 166THE CONSTANT IMAGE " But Signora Piers is not under orders , " said Boninsegna eagerly . " Nor are we , " said Carlo . " Except I 've got to go to Modena at eight o'clock this morning . And I 'm too old to go without sleep altogether . " The remark was so out of character that Harriet , anxious and wary behind her laughing masque , did not bother to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Modena before . People stood all around them , talking , laughing  --  and watching . With the imperceptible skill by which one can sometimes take advantage of a step forward or backwards , she got close enough to Lydia to exchange a private glance . Lydia 's meant " Stay ! " Boninsegna was still at Harriet 's elbow , hopeful and gallant ; she had not committed herself to leaving , and she took his arm gaily , complimenting Lydia on her dinner , and bowing to the Dalveri . " I do n't want to miss the rest of the party , " she said . " It is so beautiful , and I ca n't think when I shall ever be here to enjoy another . " She included Pina in her wide , smiling look at them all . The flat stare came back into the topaz eyes , a look of pure hatred . Pina nodded stiffly and started down the stairs 167* -- -N 12 * *CARLO telephoned in the morning , much later than usual . Modenahad been a lie . " Have you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm so uneasy . No , to tell you the truth . Have you ? " He made a mocking noise . " What time did you go to bed ? " he asked . " Six o'clock . " " Cara , it was brave of you to stay . But there was nothing else to do . " " It was such a beautiful party and I 've never been through such hell in my life . " " And you were so beautiful ! Oh , Dio ! you were so beau-tiful . " " If I had any spunk left in me I 'd be saying something about the other how-beautifuls . The Restelli is a blockbuster . " " Lascia stare la Restelli . It was only very intelligent of Lydia to have her . Tell me , amore mio , how do you feel  --  really ? " " Ca n't you hear ? " Harriet fought off a quaver in her voice . " Listen , my love , I am coming for you in an hour . " " But Carlo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tawny eyes going flat. 168THE CONSTANT IMAGE " I do n't want to explain . I have nothing to explain . " His voice roughened . " I am coming for you and we will go somewhereoutside town and find a trattoria and eat pastasciutta and a costoletta  --  " " It 's Ash Wednesday . " " Well , fish , then . But I 've been to church . And then we will come back and spend the rest of the day in bed . " " Is there anything you have n't thought out ? " said Harriet , surrendering to the quaver . " If I answer that we will both go to pieces . Tell yourself something for me , my Harriet . " " What ? " She was very tired and very near to tears . " What you say , in English . Tell yourself as many times as you can . It is true and I mean it . Be ready in an hour . " It was the last day of February and perfectly beautiful . Carlo was waiting at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house ; they drove to his garage and got into a car there . It was not the Ferrari , it was a Millecento , utilitarian , completely unnoticeable . " Whose is this ? " asked Harriet , as he started out through a labyrinth of side streets and alleys in which she was utterly lost , well as she had learnt to know Milano . She spoke English and so did he . " Oh , mine . It is used for errands and people in my office drive it . " He came out finally into the Viale Zara , far beyond the centre of the city . Harriet had been silent . She had managed for a week , since the worst tension had begun , not to say anything of this sort , but suddenly she felt as though she would burst into tears and spend the whole day weeping unless she could ease her mind by speakingwhat was in it . Carlo sensed that , he was driving slowly , sometimes touching her for a moment tenderly ; he must have felt the faint trembling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , my dearest ? " he asked . " Do n't be afraid to say it . " " I 'm worried , " she breathed . " Terribly worried that Pina may do something . " " So am I. " His jaw moved nervously . " Is n't this desperately rash ? If I thought the thing about Modena was a lie , what will she  --  " " Cara mia , I know . I am being rash  --  reckless possibly . But Oh ! Dio ! " he cried in a sort of roar , " I have never had this before  --  never  --  and I want it ! I love you , I am in love with you , I want to be with you every possible moment until  --  " and he stopped at a traffic light , turning to look at her with agony in his dark eyes . She sat pressing her lips together while tears ran down her cheeks . There was nothing she could do about it . Their hands clung , the fingers weaving together ; then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 've thought of everything I have , " said Harriet . " I 'm so terrified she will telephone my flat this morning , or your garage to see if you took out the Ferrari . You would , to drive to Modena . " " The Ferrari is having its carburetors cleaned , and if she asked any man in that garage a question he would automatically answer with a lie , having seen me leave with you . " In spite of her misery Harriet had to laugh . Italians were wonderful . " Well , and if she should telephone me  --  " " Has she ever ? " asked Carlo sharply . " Not in this way that we are worried about . But oh , darling , she will , " Harriet wailed . " I know she will because  --  " she could not say because she had ever descended to doing the same thing herself . " Anyway , if she does , Angela will tell her I am lunching with some Americans at a hotel and I will be home by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " 170THE CONSTANT IMAGE " You will be right there in bed with me , " said Carlo savagely , " and you can tell her not to be an ignorante for interrupting your afternoon rest . " Harriet shivered . " It will be better when I am gone . " " Let us not talk about it any more , " he said . " Do you think I am a fool ? " He ran his fingers through his hair and gave expressionto his own despair with a burst of speed which almost lifted the little car off the road . They found their trattoria so readily that Harriet assumed , with the vestiges of her earlier amusement , that he was no stranger there , which was corroborated by the welcoming smiles of the padrone . But also she believed that the man had no idea who Carlo was . They sat at a table in a corner behind a palm tree in a tub , and not for the first time Harriet felt the appreciationengendered by natural Italian ways . This was an humble place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a place for ordinary people without pretensions of any kind . But the tables were spread with clean white cloths , each one had a little vase of flowers , an abundant basket of good bread , well-polished coarse glasses and cutlery . On a side-table stood the big basket of fruit with a ribbon bow tied to its handle , a tray of cheeses , and the makings of half a dozen kinds of green salad . It was nothing , and it was everything , in its proffering of amenity and restful good appetite , which shone in its true light when one compared this with an eating-place of its class in some other place , in England for instance , or the United States . They did not stay long and even before three o'clock they were back in her flat . Harriet smiled at Angela and heard with relief that only Lydia had telephoned ; everybody else , she said to Carlo , has spent the morning sleeping . There was a list of errands for Angela to do , the final preparations for the cocktail171MARCIA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be back for the evening . I do n't know how long he plans to stay , she told herself , but when he leaves I mean to take a great big sleeping capsule and knock myself out . He laughed suddenly , a startling relief after their mood of the past hours , watching her face . " Why ? " she asked , as they sat on the edge of her bed , yieldingto the languor and the feeling of peace , illusory though they knew it was , which for the moment they needed more than any expression of love . " You are so tired , " he said , having long since returned to his own lovely language , full of diminutives and little words which had their special meanings all apart from literal ones . Harriet called it the bees and the flowers ' language but when he asked why , she had always refused , laughing , to explain . " You are so tired . Here . Here . There . And here . " He kissed these and other features which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to touch with his lips and his beautiful sensitive hands . " You were thinking how you will put yourself to sleep later with one of those ominous American capsules , those frightening yellow and red and green things you Americans love so . " " Everybody else loves them too , " she murmured , tracing the planes of his face with her lips . " They all beg us to bring them by the hundreds whenever we come . " " I am better for you , " he said . " I will make you sleep better than all the medicines you ever heard of . " " But later , " she whispered . " Ah . You are not quite ready to sleep now ? " " Not quite . " He gripped her bare shoulders , still smiling , delighted with her , eager , excited . But while she watched , his face changed , the172THE CONSTANT IMAGElight went out of it , his eyes and his lips tightened and narrowed , he wore the grimace of real pain . " My love , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not bear to lose you . " " And I ? " She was very pale , he saw the clear blue veins at her temples , her eyes wide and full of something she did not know how to conceal , the forbidden shadow of a different world where people who loved did not expect to lose each other . Next evening at half past seven Carlo came into Pina 's small sitting-room beside her bedroom , where she had her Empire desk , her pretty tables laden with family photographs , and her French armchairs covered with exquisite pale brocade . She was seated in one of them , dressed in a negligee , reading a fashion magazine . " Are you not ready ? " asked Carlo . He had been at home for the past hour , sitting with the children while they ate their supper , and now he had put on fresh linen and a dark pin-striped suit . " It is about time to go to that cocktail . " Pina said , " I am not going . " He stood staring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up from the magazine . " Are you ill ? " " Certainly not . I am simply not going . " " My dear , will you please put down that paper . What do you mean ? " Pina laid the magazine on the floor and looked at him . Her face was as expressionless as will-power could make it . He might have let his anger flare but this was no time for stupidities. 173MARCIA DAVENPORT " There is not anything to say about this , " he said , " that you do n't know . I think we have to go to that party as we had to go to the ball on Tuesday . " He watched her , stiff , impassive . " It is for your own sake , Pina . " " It is an insolence to tell me what is best for my sake . I tell you I am not going to that woman 's flat nor will I continue any other part of this travesty . " He thought for a moment . Then he drew a long breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be too irrational to pretend about this . The thing that matters is that she is leaving very soon , that all our friends and some who only act like friends , will be at this cocktail and that if you do not appear it will be a scandal . " " Let it . " " You can not mean that . I tell you again , you have been wise and patient up to now , I have said it before and I mean it . Believeme . I appreciate you and in the end you always know I appreciate you . I know I try you , but you know that  --  " " That 's enough . You are gargling with words . I am not going . " " Then I shall have to go alone , " he said , furious , " and say you are ill . " " If you do that I shall go to La Scala . " And show all Milano that he had lied ; and be there when people came , gabbling , straight to the theatre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several alternatives sure to be a scandal , the one which meant that neither she nor he would go to Harriet Piers 's party . This would be the most mortifying to Harriet , but its reverberations would be hateful for him and for Pina too . " You are a fool , " he said . THE CONSTANT IMAGE " So are you , to think I would put up with anything more . Nov she can look a fool too . " " Oh ? " He jerked the chair at her desk halfway round and sat in it , facing her . He dialled a number on the telephone . Pina watched him , perfectly rigid ; he saw her pinched mouth , the rise and fall of her breast . " Pronto , " he said . " Let me speak to the Signora , Giorgio . Yes . Mamma ? " Pina 's eyes were glassy , he saw her swallow . " Mamma , will you do something for me ? " He spoke with forced calm but he was very tense . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I know , " said his mother . Her voice was cold . " I had a card , but of course I never go to such things , I am too old . " " I have to ask you to go there , Mamma . Just for a moment , just to appear . Will you ? " " Carlo , this is outrageous ! I had reason to hope you would have come to your senses by now . " " Mamma , I know . I wish  --  but there is no time now . I imploreyou . " He knew that his mother understood what had happened . She was silent ; then she said , " If there is no other way to keep you and Pina out of a scandal I will go there for a moment . But this is not excusing you , you will come here tonight and listen to what I have to say to you . We are all at the end of our patience  --  Imore than anybody . " " Yes , Mamma . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have no choice . I will come to see you later . " He put down the telephone and they sat looking at each other . Once his hand moved to the dial again ; then he glanced at the little crystal clock ticking on the desk , and he shrugged . MARCIA DAVENPORTHe could not warn Harriet now , too many people would be arriving at her party . " You will regret this bitterly , " he said to Pina . He was pale with rage . " And you , I suppose , expect to go unscathed ? As usual ? " She sat clutching the cushion of her chair , the veins like cords on the backs of her beautiful white hands , her long nails digging into the silk . " Or not so long as your precious mother is here to  --  " " Pina ! " He stood over her , horrified to find himself with one hand raised . He had almost struck her . She did not move . She said , " That would not surprise me , nor anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of yourself with that woman . " " Have you gone back to your childhood ? " he said . " Have you gone stark mad with jealousy ? " " Not so mad as you . Are you stupid now , are you a clout , not to realize what you have done ? " She did not raise her voice , she spoke in the same dark tone as always , but he had never seen her in such a state . She looked like a figure cut from stone . She went on speaking . She said , " I always know . I always take the same stand , play the same part , God help me . But I am past playing now . And so are you . " " What do you mean ? " He still stood over her , his arms folded , his face contorted . Pina did not reply at once . She sat looking away , biting her lips , fighting , he saw , to keep control of her anger and say , if she spoke at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long breath and said , " Up to now I have always won . And bitter victories they were . But certain things I knew  --  " she paused . " Not any longer . This one I played like all176THE CONSTANT IMAGEthe rest . I 've known , I know , everything . Where and when and how . You fool , I always know . " " Does anybody not ? What do you think you are , " he said , " the Delphic Sibyl ? Do you think I did not know about Rene de Brissac two years ago at St. Jean ? You , the exemplary wife and mother , the pillar of virtue  --  " " I said , you are a fool . Why do you think I did it ? Why do you think I do anything ? Why do you think I went to Brussels a month ago ? " She paused to take advantage of his bewilderment . He stood silent , loathing this and waiting . " There was nothing the matter with Zia Grazia , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew what you would do , I knew you would go to join that American somewhere . I thought to give you both rope enough to hang yourselves . That was a last resort . I had done all the other things , " she said wearily , leaning back for a moment and closing her eyes as if overcome by weakness . Her fingers let go the cushion of the chair . She went on speaking , in a half-voice , with her eyes half-closed . " All the other things , the damned , damned comedy , the invitations , the graciousness , the friendship with that treacherous blonde bitch , that precious friend of hers . Always the play for time , always the smooth facade , until you should tire of her . " There was another silence . " But it was no use ! " Pina sprang from her chair , her voice came in a low , hoarse scream . " No use . I 've fought with everything I had , everything I ever knew . It was no use , " she cried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She clutched her face in her hands and broke into strangled sobs . He turned away and stood staring at the wall , staring at a panel of rosy silk , graceful with cupids and flowery garlands , beneath which177MARCIA DAVENPORThe saw the writhing of furies . Pina 's sobs were harrowing . He had almost never known her to shed a tear . " Desperately in love with her , " she cried again , " and you have never been in love in all your life before ! " He heard her with horror , with sweat running down his face , his hands clenched . She had said her last word , the rest was her terrible rasping sobs . There was nothing he could do . He would have sold his soul to give her comfort , but there was nothing he could do . He turned after a time and looked at her , still bent over with her face in her hands , and he said , " I can not say a word which will not make this worse . I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you can find the courage  --  " he stopped . " We have always been protected by your loyalty and your wisdom , Pina . And your pride . " Slowly she raised her head . " And you do not see the differencenow ? " " I see the difference . But beyond that there is no difference , no change . We are speaking grave truths . You are suffering . So am I. So is she . I do not ask your mercy for her , but you are my wife . Only you can do as my wife should do until she goes . " " You mean you intend to see her until she leaves . " " I do . And I do not intend to lie to you . I have made you suffer enough in those ways . I wish to spare you ignominy and every kind of pain except the one I can not help . But it will not be for long . " " You ask too much . " " I ask nothing . I tell you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means in a crisis like this . " " And suppose I will not be as you wish me to be ? " " Then you will be courting disaster . " 178 " You threaten me ? " She stood staring at him , her eyes enormous . " Of course not . Up to now this is a tragedy , Pina , that is bad enough . But it is not a disaster . And the rest  --  " he paused with a look of real tenderness with which he tried to quench the anger burning in her eyes . " The rest is up to all three of us . " Most of the guests had come by eight o'clock and Harriet could turn her attention from greeting them to the state of the party itself . It was relaxed and gay . It was small , she had asked about thirty-five people , almost all members of the same intimate circle who had known one another always , amongst whom there played the currents of past involvements , amorous and otherwise ; of intensities , jealousies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as well as the sparks of present situations and future possibilities . Gossip was oxygen to them , they lived for it , and they dealt it out in a special virulent ver- nacular which would make the stranger suppose them to be cruel people , devoid of loyalty and taste , which was not the case at all . One simply had to understand them and know their capacities for warmth and friendship and hospitality and loyalty , usually tribal . They possessed all these and many other lovable qualities , beside their charm and their gaiety , their grace of manner and their looks . They had come to this cocktail primed and alert to the possibility that the thing between Carlino and the pretty American whom they had in their different ways come to like was at a point where something was likely to happen .

Christ knew He was God , but what do we know ? The priest says , ' I-le was a carpenter . ' Stupid answer . " My name ai n't really Tab . It 's Timothy . A saint . I ai n't no saint . Ai n't been to confession or Mass for years . ' What for ? What 's a guy like me got to live for ? Here I am , thirtytwo , and putter around in a factory , ca n't even operate a machine . There 's automation too . No use for us guys any more . Where they goin ' to sweep us ? " He chuckled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft white light beamed down on him , and he looked at it and shifted uneasily . " Oh , they tell us they 'll train us ! They 'll make jobs for us . What do I need trainin ' for , at my age ? All I want is just to work , like always , and earn a decent livin ' . No fancy stuff . Hell , come to think of it , why work , anyways ? Factory stiff . A nobody . Kids yellin ' for television , and I 'm loaded up to here in debt for the refrigerator and the washin ' machine . Only fun I get is goin ' for a glass of beer and talkin ' with the other guys who got gripes too . " About my folks . Dad dies when I 'm fourteen . Law says I got to go to school until I 'm sixteen . I got a paper route , and I wash cars at the gas station . And there 's this chick . The " Underprivileged " Dad 's a factory bum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big fat can . I met her when I was seventeen and she 's fifteen . Same class together , with Sister Mary Dominic , and is she tired ! No wonder , all those kids . Oh , we ai n't hungry . Who goes hungry , with the Welfare and all that stuff ? We got our orange juice and vitamins and hot lunches and milk . We 're big as horses ; make our folks look like midgets . Sister Mary Dominic 's half our size . Guess she never had a chance , neither . " Tab paused , and his big tanned face darkened and became more uneasy . He shifted impatiently on the marble chair . " Nobody 's ever got a chance , " he muttered . " Hey , you , behindthat curtain , what chance did you have ? Your folks had money , eh ? Sent you to college ? Sure ! So you can sit there and listen to jerks like me and smile to yourself . We ai n't nothin ' to you . Anyway , you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time in the world ! " About my folks . Mom keeps up the laundry , then all at once she dies . I 'm seventeen . Never did know why she died . Eight of us , some younger than me , some older . Who cares ? We get the hell out . I 've got this job , and it pays me fifteen dollars a week , spare time . Not enough to live on . Then I go into this factory . New war 's on . Make big money . All the money there is . War 's going to last forever . That 's what the foreman says . Then they pull me out for the Army . What chance does a guy have ? " I do n't know what the hell I 'm doin ' here talkin ' to you . But Fran  --  she 's my wife , she 's the one with the jeans and the lipstick and the big fat can  --  she tells me to go talk toThe Listeneryou . What 've I got to lose , shootin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're you doin ' behind that curtain , anyways ? Listenin ' ! What d' you know about jerks like me who never had a chance ? " So I 'm in the Army . What 's the Korean war about ? Who cares ? Had a hell of a good time . Tokyo . All those places . If I 'd had an education I could 've stayed there in one of these houses , with maids and everything , and big pay from the gov'mint . But I never had a chance , and they shipped me back , and there 's this chick , waitin ' for me . Oh , we fooled around . She 's kind of pretty , if you like a kid who shows all of her upper teeth and her tongue and squints her eyes and tries to look like Hollywood and the movies . First thing you know , there 's a kid comin ' along . I wanted to duck the whole thing , but she brings around a priest , not the young , sick kind I used to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand for no foolin ' . Big hams on him ; like to break your neck if you say anythin ' . Well , anyway , we got to get married . And then this priest says , What about the G. I. Bill ? ' Well , what about it ? Here I am , married , though I do n't want to be , and a kid comin ' , and my dad had three of us at my age . Who wants to get educated and sit around in an office drawin ' maybe thirty bucks a week ? I can go in a factory and get three times that , with fringe benefits . So I go , and Fran howls , and I slam her in the jaw , and the cops come and I get a suspended sentence . Nobody made a big noise when Dad slammed Mom around , except us kids . Jesus , how we howled ! I remember I bit Dad in the leg , and I was only four then . " Tab grinned , then scowled . " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She was doin ' her best , was n't she ? And she half his size . Wonder what makes people do the lousy things they do . Maybe they never had a chance . " Tab looked belligerently around the room , one hand clenched on his knee . But there was no one there . The light flowed down upon him , warm and soft . " Hell , " he muttered . " Well , now I got three kids , and they want everythin ' . Fran says they ca n't have it . She 's got this budget . Baby-sits , too , as if she ai n't got enough work to do without that . She thinks money in the bank 's somethin ' everybody should have . Why ? Money 's made to spend and have a good time on . But not Fran . Come to think of it , she ai n't so pretty any more . Gettin ' old , though she 's only thirty . Maybe that 's old for a dame , I guess . And she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ai n't that somethin ' ? " What do I get ? I can tell you this : I get more than the schoolteachers , even if I 'm only a factory stiff ! Yes sir ! Think that one over . Is Fran satisfied ? Oh no . Not my old girl . She wants me to go to this automation school the factory has . Learn somethin ' , she says . And she shoves her damn books at me from the library . You know somethin ' ? Women make me sick . Always tryin ' to be bigger than they are , and not the way you think , either ! They never know a guy do n't have a chance these days . " The warm and mutely lit room was silent . Tab glared at the curtain . " One of those headshrinkers , huh ? Listen and then write books about us poor jerks who never had a chance . What 'm I here for ? Well , I 've had all there is . I 'm pullin ' out . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go on Wei-45The Listener The " Underprivileged " fare . Why not ? That 's what taxes are for , ai n't they ? Anyway , the way they 're throwin ' the atom bombs around , there wo n't be no world soon , anyway . Or maybe it 's the hydrogen bomb . Or missiles . So why not live it up ? Well , Fran seems to know what I 've got in mind , and she says , Go to that place Mr. Godfrey built . ' I say no , and she begs and cries , and what the hell can you do with women ? Hey , are you a priest back there ? I hear you 're a Jew . Know what I think about Jews ? There 's this guy in the Army --  Hell , who cares ?

A white man do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surlily at the curtain . " Maybe you 're thinkin ' about the bonus I got from the state . That was n't Fran 's business . Had a good time on it ; four hundred dollars . A guy 's got a right to have a good time once in his life , do n't he ? What 've I got to live for ? Bet you never saw a lathe or a saw or a hammer in your life . What do you guys know about workin ' ? I work forty hours a week , and then I fall on my face . " He paused , then grinned sheepishly . " Hell , my dad worked twelve hours a day , six days a week . The sucker . Wonder how he did it . Yeh , I wonder how he did it . Did you ever work twelve hours a day ? " The silence of the room appeared to enlarge and to hold him . He rubbed his jaw . " Hell , Fran ai n't a bad kid . I 'm not complainin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe Fran did n't , neither . She worked , too , in this diner . And now there 's these kids . Molly 's kind of cute , but the two boys just46yell all the time . " He laughed shortly . " Just like me and my brothers yelled . No wonder Dad and Mom used to clip us . But Molly 's kind of cute . She was real cute in that Christmas bit at St. Aloysius . An angel . She looks kind of like Fran . Yeh . Come to think of it , women do n't have such a hot time , do they ? They get pretty and then they marry  --  " He looked at the curtain . He was a big and burly young man ; he stood up , his hands hanging at his sides , his face thrust forward . He said softly , " And then they marry jerks like me . That 's what they do . They marry jerks like me . " His face changed , became heavy end sober . He rubbed his chin again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Poor Molly . " He moved toward the curtain and said earnestly , " But I guess you do n't have a mother now , do you , and I guess you do n't know about women . " The curtain did not move . He looked at it uncertainly . Then he cried out , " Why do n't you talk ? Why do n't you tell me what to do ? I 've got Fran and Molly , have n't I ? " He ran to the curtain and pushed the button savagely . The curtains rolled apart swiftly , and the inner light rushed out upon him . He looked , and stood in utter silence . Then his eyes filled , and the tears ran down his full cheeks as if he were a child again . " Yeh , " he whispered . " I guess you do know about women , about Mom and Fran and Molly . Yeh , I guess you do . Say , do you think there 's a chance for me ? I mean , a real chance for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But you did n't , did you ? " His hand stretched forward , and the sullen and hostile face 47The Listenersoftened . " I guess I 'd better be goin ' , " he said . " It 's too late for Mom now , but Fran 's waitin ' . You wo n't forget me , will you ? You wo n't forget ? I 'm goin ' to that automation school tomorrow . I 'm sorry I said you do n't know nothin ' about work . You sure worked hard , did n't you ? All your life . For jerks like me . " SOUL THREEThe Despised and Rejected " . . . despised and rejected from among men . " 48SOUL THREEIt was an extremely hot day , but the air was pure and fresh and cool in the sitting room . The young man enteringwas dressed in black . He . paused on the threshold as the 1 bronze door began to close on his heels . He glanced about at the waiting men and women and waited , himself , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearednot to notice him . They were sunk in engrossing thoughts of their own . He hated himself for apologetically tiptoeing to the slit in the wall , where he dropped a sealed note . Then he threw back his shoulders , carefully chose a chair far from the others , and sat down and waited . The others did not look at him . He picked a magazine from a table and riffled through the pages . He could not concentrate . He lifted his head , and though he coolly scrutinized the waitingroom his eyes were timid . He wondered what the man behind that door would think51The Listenerof his note . He smiled disdainfully . What did it matter what anyone thought now ? Why had he come here ? A chance word , a half-remembered line in the newspaper ? This was no place for him . If only there were some pictures on the stark white walls ! But no . A man , apparently , was to be left solely with his thoughts . Now , that was very pleasant ! His thoughts . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He tried to answer them angrily ; they remained . He tried to keep his anger , but it became a question too . He studied his companions furtively . Why were they here ? What troubles did that rosy fat man in the fine summer silk suit have , or that young woman with her pretty white face and light hair ? Or that young man with the brief case at his knee ? Or that comfortable matron who was knitting ? What agony could they have , compared with his ? The chime sounded , and one by one they rose and went into the mysterious room behind the oaken door . The young man strained to hear voices , one complaining , the other complacently soothing . There were no voices . Was it a chapel in there ? If so , he would stalk out . There was no place in a chapel for him , or in hypocrisy , or breezy common sense . He himself was a curse . He hated himself and hated those who hated him . Then the chime sounded for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , and rose . He began to tiptoe , then put his feet down solidly and wished the carpet could register his step . He held his good hat in his hand . He stalked to the oaken door and pushed it open and saw only gentle lightThe Despised and Rejectedand the marble chair with its velvet cushions , and the curtainedalcove . Seeing the latter , he smiled grimly . A psychiatrist , as he suspected , or one of those busy social workers , or a clergyman . He sat down . " Good afternoon , " he said in a beautiful voice . There was no answer , but all at once he felt that his greeting had been returned . Never mind ! He was tired of their politeness , their vigorous pretending that he was not what he was . " I am a Negro , " he said coldly . " I am twenty-five years old . My name is Gideon Cowles , and I was born in this city . I was graduated from the university here four years ago . With honors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen of the best hotel  --  as a part-time cook and full-time dishwasher . " The room waited . He could feel peace and alertness about him , and a listening . " Oh yes , " he said , and tried to laugh . " They call you the Man who Listens . ' It is engraved over the door . Splendid . I am glad you are listening . No one ever listened to me before , not even in the orphan asylum where I was brought up . Not even a clergyman . I hope you are not offended  --  if you are a clergyman . I know how busy you all are ; there are n't enough of you . Sometimes'I wonder if that is n't the trouble with the world . There are not enough clergymen . " He bent his head and considered this with a kind of wonder . " But then , " he said in a thinking voice , " who wants to be a clergyman these days ? You are poorly paid ; you are held in low esteem ; you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know any powerful politicians . You go through the streets of your parish , calling to your flocks  --  who do notThe ListenerThe Despised and Rejectedlisten . Forgive me ; I come of a poetic race . Did you know that Negroes are naturally poetic ? Indeed they are . " You clergymen call at the gates , and no one opens them for you . You cry in your pulpits , and they yawn . You speak of the Fatherhood of God and the Brotherhood of Man , and they nod , and go home to hate their neighbor . You go up and down , and no one hears your footsteps . Many of you are desperately poor  --  as Christ was poor  --  and no one cares . You stand at your altars and look at empty pews . You are a voice in the wilderness , and you may as well be voiceless . You offer Communion with your God , and the lips that take it are profane . You sing the Psalms of David , and the women think of the Sunday dinner and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; there is television waiting . There is a whole , evil , boisterous world outside your churches , ringing with bells and pounding with horns , and shattering with drums and whining with wheels , and shouting with silly bouncing voices . What effect has your voice against all these ? No more than a bird 's call , " What do your people want ? They want everything . Ex- cept you . And your God . You are despised and rejected among men . " He put his hands over his eyes . " As I am despised and rejected among men . " The silence waited . The young man sighed and dropped his slender dark hands on his knees . " My own people laugh at me . The university graduates among us are sour and dis- gruntled . Do you blame them ? They have no place to go with their degrees . Except to the meanest work . What nice 54 house will shelter them ? What intelligent white man will welcome them and drink and eat with them ? Many of them become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them and assure them that in the coming Soviet world they will be equal . Equal to what , to whom ? We are the despised and the rejected . We know what liars men are . " Do you know what it means to be despised and rejected , turned away , laughed at , cursed , hated ? Did any man ever treat you like this  --  as I have been treated ? Did you ever feel a blow or see a look of disgust ? Did you ever hear catcalls and jeers ? Did any man say your people were less than animals ? Were you ever driven away or refused food or shelter ? Did you ever cry to your God , asking why He had forsaken you ? " Gideon stood up and cried aloud , striking his hands together in the utmost despair . " Did you ever feel your own blood on your face and in your hands ? Worse , did you ever feel your heart bleed helplessly ? Did you look for one single accepting face ? I tell you , I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , and the light , like a presence of pity and love and understanding . He began to cry helplessly . " I 'm sorry , " he stammered . " You are a clergyman , a preacher . I can feel it , even from behind those curtains . I 've insulted you . I 'm sorry . But still , as a white man , you ca n't know what it means to be despised and rejected . " He moved slowly to the curtains and timidly touched the55The Listenerbutton . The curtains rolled back , and he saw the light and who stood in the light . He burst into deep sobs . He extended his hands . " Forgive me , " he groaned . " For you know , do n't you ? " He waited humbly . Then he whispered , " I 've always known that I wanted to be a clergyman , to speak to my people with the authority of faith and with the love of God . But I was angry against man  --  and God . How could I tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw the hatefulnessof man ? There is a theological seminary here and they wo n't reject me  --  you 've made me see my own heart and what I really wanted , and where I was needed , for you 've never despised us . " He smiled , and the smile was now neither haughty nor timid . It was the smile of an accepted son whose father has always loved him . SOUL FOURThe BetrayedI do not know this man you are talking about . Mark 14:7156S O UL FOURThe man who sat in the marble chair was neither middle-aged nor old . His winter tweeds were good , if worn ; his shoes were handmade , if beginning to crack . His expensivetie showed signs of constant ironing . He sat with dignity , his gray hair smooth , his quiet face rigid and bitter . Then he smiled with faint contemptuousness at the curtains . All this childish superstition ! This amateur psychiatry , this self-diagnosis ! He , Clive Summers , knew all the psychiatric jargon and the proclaimed methods . You " talked " out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the expensive hour  --  and you found your own solution in the babblings of your own tongue . The new confessional ! The most modem way of discovering your foolish self , as if it were precious ! Had n't he tried it ? He had tried three thousand dollars ' worth , and God knows he could n't afford that much waste of money now . It had been a long59The Listenertime , in fact , since he could afford much of anything . And of course there were Celia 's chronic doctors ' bills for her arthritis , and there was his idiot son  --  Well , no , George was n't quite an idiot , but pretty close , with his enthusiasms . The white and utterly silent room waited . Mr. Summers looked about him curiously . Where did the heat come from , this harsh winter day , and the light ? He could hear no ventilating fans and see no warm-air outlets . He had never known John Godfrey , a small-time lawyer who had never entered through the door of the Summers Metals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clerk , except with a subpoena , if even that . Yet he had had the money to build this trumpery pseudo-temple and create this maudlin religious atmosphere . For whimpering housewives and failuresand clerks and petty mystics who needed an ear as others need a laxative . Well , then .. He spoke in his tight and careful voice . " Good afternoon . " No one answered . He said , " I am Clive Summers . If you are a resident of this city you 'll recognize the name ; everybody knows me or of me . " He looked at the curtains , and squared shoulders which had taken on a tendency to sag these past five years . The curtains remained shut and still . Mr. Summers thought of the psychiatrists he had known socially and the one he had known both socially and professionally . His thin cheeks reddened . One of them was behindthat damned curtain ! Could he be trusted ? You could not trust a man unless you had bought him . And often , not even then. 6oThe Betrayed " I hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is said in here is confidential ? By the way , I have deposited twenty dollars in your  --  offering  --  box , with the suggested note , which no doubt you have had time to read now . The money is not meant as an offering , which I understand is never requested . But , as I have paid for your time as a professional consultant , you are ethically obliged not to reveal confidences of your  --  patients . Not that I am , in any sense of the word , a patient . ' It is just that I know that I am going blind , in spite of what the doctors say . " There was no answer . Mr. Summers wished to be irritated , but he found himself , instead , relaxing in the chair . But he spoke warningly . " I have ways of discovering who betray my confidences , I assure you . " Again he waited . Mr. Summers laughed shortly . " ' The Man who Listens . ' Who does , except a paid psychiatrist who hardly regards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a case then ; you are a disturbed mind . ' You are emotionally involved . ' Therefore , not quite sound . You see , I know all about your profession . Well , listen . " But he could not speak for a while . He listened for the scratch of a pencil in this profound quiet , the rustle of paper , the shift of feet , the creak of a chair . There was nothing . No rumble of traffic reached this room , no footstep , no voice . He sat in a silence that was like eternity . His clenched hands loosened . He said , and it was easier to speak now : " I am going to destroy a man . Utterly and completely destroy him . So thoroughlydestroy him that he 'll have to leave this city , and61The Listenerpenniless , if I have my way . It 's possible that a man such as he is will kill himself when I reach him , which will be soon . I hope so ! That will be the final pleasure , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you see , he betrayed me . " He looked at his watch . " I assume twenty dollars will pay for at least half an hour ? If not , you may send me your bill . " He spoke arrogantly , but the arrogance fell into the quiet as ineffectually as a feather . " I still live on Humberson Avenue . " He paused . " But not much longer , I am afraid . It is going to be sold for  --  for  --  taxes . " Now his voice brokewith despair . " Celia and I built that house . She was a schoolteacher , and therefore had very little money . I was a young chemical engineer , working for thirty-five dollars a week . It was the Depression then . We were fortunate , in a way : we had a little flat , and we ate enough , and we had just enough clothing . Just enough . We both hated poverty . Do you know what it means to be poor ? Hopelessly poor ? Our parents were that poor . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The majority of men do n't mind it , because they have no imagination . But Celia and I had imagination . On Sunday afternoons we 'd walk on Humberson Avenue  --  it 's never deteriorated  --  and we 'd look at a few empty lots and plan for the day when we 'd have one of them and build our own house on it . We planned every room , the color of every wall , the trees in the rear gardens , the exact shade of stone we 'd use , the fountain , the bedrooms , the nursery , the hall with its great chandelier . " It took me many years , but we finally fulfilled our dream. 6zThe BetrayedI had invented a new metallurgic process  --  I wo n't bore you with the details , which would mean nothing to you . I had many offers for the patent , but I kept it : I believed in it . I started out with a small shop , employing one man besides myself . Up to five years ago I employed five hundred . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son George , who is also a chemical engineer . He never would go in with me , and it was a terrible disappointment . He 's a fool , full of enthusiasms . He says he wants to begin as I began . " Mr. Summers ' voice broke again , and he did not know that there was a sound of reluctant pride in it . " Celia and I could n't afford a family until it was almost too late . All our savings went into my first shop and into equipment . We wanted children , but there was no time , no money . We needed every penny . Celia continued to teach , and I worked day and night , and I 'd forget to sleep or eat . Then Celia was suddenly thirty-eight and I was forty-one , and we had our lot and we had the money for our house . And we were rich ! It was only on Celia 's birthday , when she was thirty-eight , that we had time , all at once , to realize the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't young any longer , and if we were to have any children at all we must begin immediately . And so we had George , but Celia could have no more children . She almost died when George was born ; she was a little old to be having her first child . The house was n't quite finished when we moved in . But women are sentimental . Celia wanted George to be born in our own house , for which we 'd worked so many years . " The ListenerHe chuckled dryly , then started at the sound and put his carefully tended fingers to his lips , as if he had uttered an obscenity . But he shook his head over and over , musingly , and his dry smile lifted the corners of his bitter mouth . " It was winter , and only four rooms could be heated ; the entire equipment was n't yet in , and the plaster was still wet , and there was no wallpaper or paint . It was , in a way , like the life we 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big black old stove temporarily heating the bedroom , a bare table in the kitchen , no curtains at the windows . Makeshift . I never heard Celia laugh so much . She never laughed again quite like that . " He laughed himself , a rustling murmur like the crackle of parchment . He forgot where he was , remembering . Then he came to himself and stared at the shut curtains . He said a little huskily , " You 're very patient , I see . Thank you . I ca n't remember when I 've talked like this . I was always so busy , too busy for conversation . It must have been lonely for Celia , even with the clubs she joined after we became rich , and her community activities , and only one child who was cared for by experts . No illiterate nursemaids , you see . Yes , it must have been lonely . " He paused , struck and frowning , and shook his head again . " That 's a stupid remark , " he said . " Celia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars , leisure , effortless living , travel . Of course I was too busy to travel much with her ; she had an older sister , a widow , and she would travel with Ethel . Then Ethel died ; that was about ten years ago . And then Celia had no one . " 64The BetrayedAgain he paused , and now he shifted violently on the chair . " Nonsense . I must be losing my mind . Celia had everything . And everyone . Friends , house buzzing with women 's meetings , the church affairs , the Philharmonic Women 's Committee , the various hospital boards . Of course Celia was always a little shy ; the schoolteacher 's personality , ' I would say to her . It was hard for her to mingle easily . Then of course she was at some disadvantage . All the other women had been in these things from girlhood , and Celia was a late arrival , and I believe there was some social snobbery  --  People are fools , are n't they ? But I suppose you know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The word echoed back from the gleaming white walls like an accusation . Mr. Summers said hurriedly , " Celia began to develop arthritis , or perhaps it was neuritis . At any rate , it is hard for her to walk much now , and she 's only sixty-four . Damn those doctors ! They can talk about miracle drugs and new treatments , but , so far as I can see , people are as frequentlyand mysteriously sick as they were when I was a boy . Celia spends a lot of time in bed now , poor girl . And  --  " He hesitated , then spoke in a shamed voice . " We have only a maid of all work , as we used to call them , and she only part time . We ca n't afford even that now . " He waited for a superior murmur from behind the curtains , a condescension . But there was no sound . However , Mr. Summers became suddenly and acutely aware of a deep listening , a weighing , a kind measuring , a sympathy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had dimmed . " I hope , " he said a little hoarsely , " that I 'm not going to lose65The Listener my eyesight into the bargain . That would just top every thing , would n't it ? " He coughed , and the cough was like a sob . Then his words rushed out . " I wish I could do something for Celia ! Damn it , do you know that I did n't really see her for nearly twenty-five years , until just recently ? Now you 'll think I 'm out of my mind . I mean that I was always too busy to see ' her . She was just Celia to me . Perhaps it was six months ago or less when I saw ' Celia . It was a shock to me . Sixty-four is n't a great age now , you know , what with vita mins and exercise and beauty parlors . But when I saw Celia , she was old , very old . Not so much physically --  " He stopped . " What in God 's name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Of course it was physically ! Her hair was dyed , and her skin was smooth  --  you know all those creams women use  --  and her body was slender . But she was old . " He stopped . " Even older than I. And that 's a damned funny thing . She 's three years younger . Of course women age earlier . But there was something strange about it . It was as if Celia had become lifeless . That 's the word . Lifeless . And I had the peculiar sensation that she 'd been that way for a long time . God ! I must really be going out of my mind ! Or blind . " His voice rose , became harsh and brutal . " I can see now . It was all that worry over me . Celia 's afraid . She 's afraid of being poor again . And that 's what Henry Fellowes did to me  --  to Celia . He made us poor again . Poor Celia . Poor Celia ! " He stood up in his powerful hate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the room , his footsteps echoing on the marble floor . The turmoil of his spirit filled the room . " I do n't know why I 've been blabbering like this , when the most important thing in my life is still unsaid . ' What has Celia to do with it , or George , that young idiot ? I had no intention of telling you about Celia and George  --  wasting your time ! If I had n't stopped myself , I 'd be telling you now that I never even saw the gardens we planted . They were pictured in that big national magazine ; Celia was so proud of them ; she worked side by side with the gardeners . George and Celia stood there together in the photographs , and I thought to myself  --  you can see how things had affected me  --  Is that actually my son , George , near Celia , with his arm around her shoulder ? ' I did n't recognize him at first . I had n't seen ' George for years , not really seen ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , but George had everything I could give him . Everything . Ungrateful , too . He never once thanked me . He 's been pouting for years because I did n't have the time to go to Boston when he was graduatedfrom Harvard . Children are very ungrateful these days . I tried to explain to him that I had a government contract , but he shrugged it off . Now he has a government contract  --  a very small one , no importance  --  himself  --  " He took off his glasses and wiped them vigorously . " Damn it ! Am I getting cataracts ? Everything seems a little dim . " He sat down in the chair with determination . " I 'm taking up too much of your time . Just send me your bill . It 's very relieving , though , to talk . I have n't really talked to anyone for years . I was brought up in an age when a man valued67The Listenerevery hour and knew he must accomplish something . I remember what I learned in Sunday school about the talents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one who was afraid to invest the talent he was given and buried it in the ground-where it certainly did n't breed other talents ! You must utilize every minute . " He stopped . " And now I can utilize nothing . " His hands made fists . " Henry Fellowes . I did n't tell you . He was the first man I took on . He was my partner , a school chum ; was graduated when I was graduated . Chemical engineer , like myself . ( By the way , did I tell you that I receivedan ' E ' from the government during the war ? Where is that flag now ? I do n't know , and I do n't care . ) " His voice became deep , almost groaning . " E ' for excellence . What excellence ? I 'm getting old too . Never mind . Henry Fellowes . You do n't need the details . I trusted Henry , more than a brother . My partner . Worked together , denying ourselves everything . Together , we became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Divorced one stupid woman after another ; five of them . They only wanted his money . I 'd try to tell him . Marry somebody like Celia , ' I 'd say . But no . Henry had been poor , as Celia and I had . He wanted glittering women , all teeth and flounce . He was like a kid who has no money but stares through the window of a candy store . And when he gets some money he runs in and gorges . And makes himselfsick . Henry is n't a fool , not normally . But those women of his ! Bleached , hard , singing , chattering , flashing . He must have a vulgar streak in him somewhere . He could n't have enough of the bitches . " The BetrayedMr . Summers laughed briefly . " It 's very funny . He thought , each time he married , that the woman would becomelike Celia  --  I suppose . Settle down in a nice house and have children . They never did , of course . They wanted his money , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And lovers . He always found out . But he had a juvenile personality . Celia wanted to help him , to introduce him to friends of hers , lonely widows . I told her , Mind your own business , Celia . A man always knows what he wants . Henry would n't be interested in your well-bred friends . ' I was right , of course . Henry wanted something they call glamour . " Mr. Summerspaused . " At least I think he wanted that . He 'd never had any gaiety in his life when he was young . He had no discrimination . He had no one like Celia to give him a sense of values . " He became aware of what he had said , and stared blankly . Then he frowned , and his face blackened . He struck the arm of the marble chair with his fist . " What has all this to do with anything ? I had no intention of telling you all this rot . All you need to know is that Henry 's paying alimony to at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expensive . They 're like leeches  --  on Henry . Sucking his blood . Naturally it serves him right . But he was always the hopeful , buoyant type , like a kid . And then it happened , inevitably . I had pneumonia five years ago , a bad siege . I was out for five months , then we went to Montego Bay so I could recover . When I came back I found that Henry had swindled me , ruined me , practically sold me out . He had a team of very shrewd lawyers . The details don'tThe Listener The Betrayedmatter . What does matter is that he betrayed me , his friend , the one who gave him a start , who helped him to become rich in the first place . " Mr. Summers started forward in the chair , his face fierce , yet wounded and bewildered . " When I asked Henry to come in with me he was making twenty-five dollars a week . He never did have any sense of direction . But we were old friends . He was like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' I said , ' and we 'll do big things together . ' He was doubtful . ' We 'll have the whole world , ' I said . ' I 'm counting on you , Henry , to help me establish something . ' I must have reached him finally , for he looked at me trustfully . ' You mean that you want me ? ' he said . ' More than anything else , ' I told him . ' Come with me . ' " He did . And then he betrayed me . The details do n't matter . Now I have less than five thousand dollars in the bank . I have no company  --  my company . All my friends have deserted me . I 'm all alone . Betrayed . By Henry , whom I trusted , on whom I built . Do you know what I heard recently ? He was in one of those clubs I formerly belonged to but which I ca n't afford now . Someone said to him , ' What 's become of Clive Summers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ? ' " And he said , ' Clive Summers ? Clive Summers ? Oh , Clive Summers . I do n't know . ' And then he walked away . That 's what someone told me . He did n't even know me , after all these years , and after what I 'd done for him ! He actually implied he had n't even known me ! " Mr. Summersagain beat the arms of his chair with his fists . " He had n't even known me , the man he betrayed ! " He stood up and shouted : " Do you think they believed him ? No ! One of my old friends  --  he does n't know me now  --  said , ' Why , you and Clive were in partnership for years ! Wherever I saw you , I saw him . ' And he denied it . We were n't friends ; it was just a loose business association . Only an association , in passing . Who did he think he was deceiving ? Henry Fellowes . Why , I loved him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have been closer . " He said in a lower voice , almost whispering , " We could n't have been closer . " Mr. Summers walked almost within touching distance of the immovable curtains . " But what do you know about betrayal ? " he challenged . " Oh , in an academic sense , no doubt . As one of the facets of the human personality . But did anyone betray you ? Do you think it was just the money he defrauded me of ? No . It was his denial of me , his desertion . That was the worst , the most terrible thing . He 'd not even known me ! " The curtains did not stir . The room seemed to smile deeply in its whiteness . Mr. Summers cried , " What do you know ? About betrayal ? Who ever betrayed you , you , smug behind that curtain ? " He plunged his finger on the button , and the curtains whirled aside in the overwhelming light . Mr. Summers stepped back , staring , and then he bent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from what he saw . After a long time he said , " Yes . Yes , of course . You knowThe Listenerall about betrayal . Who , more than you , should know ? Forgiveme . " His legs felt boneless and weak , and he fell to his knees and covered his face with his hands . Another long time passed . He could feel the light all about him . Then he spoke again , whisperingly , and with pauses . " I 'm sorry for Henry . You see , I can ruin him now . I have the facts . At first I was too sick and stunned . Now I have the facts and the lawyers . I can have him prosecuted , thrown into jail , for fraud and misappropriation of funds , and a dozen other things . But I am not going to do it . " He has another wife , and I 've heard she is worse than all the others , and he 's desperate , even with the money he took from me by fraud and manipulation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's remorseful . After all , he is as old as I am . A man does n't get younger . He must be lonely . He must be as lonely as Celia and George . " Whatever Henry did , he must live with it . At least I 'm clean of anything like that . " Mr. Summers took his hands from his eyes . " Are you still listening ? " he asked humbly . " But you always listen , do n't you ? Are n't you ever tired ? " ' As lonely as Celia and George . ' That 's a strange thing to think of , is n't it ? I am beginning to remember Celia before we built that house . She used to laugh and sing in our little flat . She would agree with me that it would be wonderful to have that big house  --  someday . Do you know ? I do n't think she cared ; she was just kind , and she went into the dream with me because she thought that was what I wanted too . Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had it. 72The BetrayedBut I did n't see Celia any longer . I did n't even miss her . Until everything I had was gone . I did n't notice my son , with his governess and his tutor , and then his boarding schools , and then his university . I was proud of his reports , yes . But I never really saw him . I buried my one talent in the ground . I wonder if it is still there . " He dropped his hands . " There was n't any time , no . Not for worthless things . There never was . " He stood up resolutely , like a young man . He laughed a little . " George has some radical idea about the conversion of energy through manipulation of metals . But you know more about these things than we do , do n't you ? He 's tried to interestme . He 's looking for a partner . I am going to be that partner with my five thousand dollars . I 'm going to work in a shop again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he 'll never betray me . Never . My son . My son will never betray me . " I must go home now and tell Celia . I 've just had the most peculiar idea . I think when I tell Celia she 'll get out of bed and she wo n't be sick any longer . I often wonder at the patience of good women . And your mother ? Was she patient too ? Yes , yes . She must be the most patient of all . Please give her my love . " 73SOUL FIVEThe Father 's BusinessDid you not know that I must be about My Father 's business ? Luke 2:49SOUL FIVE " So , you listen , huh ? " said Barney Lefkowitz heavily . " A doctor . One of them psychiatrists . So , what 's there to listen to ? Me , I 've been listening for forty years .

Only thing that 's good about it , my wife 's dead . If she was here , it 'd be worse . I 'd have her to worry about too . You see , it 's our boy , Morris . " He shifted weightily in the chair . Again he wiped his forehead , as if he were weeping at every pore . " Every Yiddisher mother wants her boy to be a doctor or a lawyer . A dentist , maybe . But a doctor 's the best . We saw them in the old country , in their carriages , with horses , and coats with fur collars , and fur gloves . A doctor . He 's like a rabbi , see ? One 's for the soul , the other 's for the body . Do n't know which one gets hurt more easy . ( You a psychiatrist , huh , like a lot of bright Jewish boys ? ) Well , that 's new . Morris , he 's just a specialist . Cancer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years old . Never got married . Too busy taking care of everybody else . " He sighed and looked about the white and shining room . " Kind of like a temple , " he said . He glanced down at the hat on his plump knee . " Well , I hear you can come in here and you listen . All the time in the world . " Bertha and me , we work so Morris can go to this doctor college . Bertha works by the store too . Every cent in the bank , for Morris and the college . A nice boy , Morris . A good boy . Even in school the teachers say he 's a good boy . A fine scholar . Not like me . Never a word that ai n't good . NoThe Father 's Businessscreaming , like other kids . And even when he 's little , he comes in here for the meat and takes it to the customers . Polite like a king , and some of those women  --  ! " I should complain ! If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have gone to the college . They ask every year , How is the bank account for Morris ? ' No , we do n't complain . Times are bad , we give credit . When times get better , they pay . That 's poor people . There 's this big fancy store on Shelton Street where the rich ladies go . They pay when they think of it , and they do n't think often . Money do n't mean anything to them . " Maybe you got all the time there is . I do n't . I got to be back for the phone . Well , it was three days before Morris graduated , with that funny hat they put on . And Bertha 's shopping for a new dress , and this kid is driving and he runs her down , and that 's all . She says to me in the hospital , Never mind , Barney . You go to the graduation like I was there . And maybe I will be too . ' So , after the funeral  --  maybe you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We bury the dead before sunset . Morris is eight hundred miles away , and he ca n't get a plane for two days . The holidays . Easter . Well . What does it matter ? Bertha was n't there anyway . What an angel . So , we do it the way she wanted ; she had a right to say , did n't she ? And I was there , and after the graduation Morris breaks down in my arms , and then we go to the temple and he says kaddish . " Morris , he wants to be a cancer specialist . Eight more years . I work , and he works , and it 's eight years . Then I say , What about a nice girl , Morris ? ' And he only smiles. 78 79The ListenerHe has work to do . He do n't have an office ; he goes in one of them big hospitals . Intern . Another two years . Then he 's on the staff , with a nice salary . " You should see my boy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a prophet . We 'll have a break-through , Papa , ' he says , all excited . Then we 'll know what causes it and how to cure it . You should see the kids who come to this hospital , Papa . People think cancer 's just for old people , but do you know something ? More kids die of cancer before they are fifteen than of all the other diseases put together ! We need more money . There 's this cyclotron , and the isotopes . We 'll have a break-through . ' " You 'd think he was doing it all by himself . He never stops working . His salary gets bigger . He gives most of it to the cancer funds . I would n't take a cent , though he offers . What do I have now but Morris ? And I keep hoping he 'll find a nice girl and there 'll be kids . A man needs a grandson . I keep hinting . And he just smiles and talks cyclotron and the need for money . Hospitals always need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on popcorn every year would build big cancer hospitals ! Popcorn ! That 's a funny thing . Death  --  and popcorn . When you think of it , it seems like it was always that way , do n't it ? " He cocked his head . He thought that he had heard a murmuring , sad assent . " You say something ? " he said politely . He waited . His hands were wet , and his face , and he scrubbed them with his handkerchief . " I do n't know why I 'm wasting your time , Doctor . You8oThe Father 's Businesshear these things every day . It 's an old story . It do n't get any better , though , does it ? " And now Morris is thirty-five . When he comes home for the holidays a year ago I notice he looks sick , but he 's smiling . Sick and thin . Like he has consumption . I get scared . They do n't feed him right in the hospital . No , Papa , ' he says , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some more . You 'd think there was n't anything else in the world . But I think about Morris . And so I get this young fellow to be by the store and I go to Morris ' hospital . I know the old doctor there , chief of staff . I say to him , My boy 's sick . Tell me . Do n't keep me in suspense . ' " The doctor 's an old friend . Loves Morris like a son . And so he tells me . " The room was silent . Then suddenly it was broken by faint cries and the sound of weeping . They went on for a long time . " It 's what they call occupational hazard , " stammered Barney . " Excuse me . A grown man should n't cry like a baby . But Morris has got cancer ; in the brain . They ca n't do nothing about it . All those cyclotrons and X rays . Maybe Morris got careless . Nobody knows . The cancer 's slow-growing , they tell me . Maybe a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me on the back , and the old doctor breaks down , and I got to comfort him ! Funny , eh , and Morris is my boy ! " Morris ? He 's still alive . I go to see him last week , and I says to him , Morris , come home . You look like a skeleton . Come home with Papa , Morris . ' And he says , Papa , don't8iThe Listener you know I must be about God 's business ? ' That 's what he says . And what can I say ? " I ca n't sleep . The telephone 's by my bed . I look at it in the store . Any day . Any minute . They do n't know . And Morris is working in the hospital , like he 's in good health . God 's business ! ' Any minute . He 'll work till he dies . Saving people . With all that pain ! And knowing he 's going to die . Any minute . " Barney folded his arms on his knees and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The light increased about him . He looked up , dazed . Then he got to his feet . " Anyway , I feel better , just telling you , you a doctor , too . I 've got to go back . Maybe there 's a telephone call . Who knows ? I tell you , it 's like something bleeding away inside , waiting . Only a father can understand . You a father ? Only a father , watching his son suffer , waiting for him to die . Because he lived for other people and not himself . You know something ? I ca n't go to the temple now . I 'm scared I 'll start screaming . " Barney hesitated . He looked shyly at the curtains . And then at the button . Then slowly he approached the curtains and pushed the button . The curtains flowed aside instantly , and Barney stepped back , trembling . He stood and looked , with the tears on his cheeks . He said very gently , " Yes , I guess your father knew what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I guess so . So , I guess I 'm not alone , after all . " He gravely put on his hat . " I see , Landsman , that they82 The Father 's Businessput another kind of yarmilke on you , did n't they ? They always do . They always do . " He went to the door , turned and looked at who stood in the light . " I guess , maybe , I 'll go to see my rabbi . The store can wait . Even the telephone . God and me , we 've got business ' too .

Luke 7:47SOUL SIXMary Lanska came softly into the sitting room , carrying her flowers . It was almost midnight , and , as she hoped , there was no one else there .

She bent her head to smell the flowers . They had cost all her tips in the restaurant for the past week . Beautiful ! She loved flowers . They were much better than a lot of people . She did not know the names of all of them , but she recognized daffodils and iris and white lilies and innocent fringed daisies . They exhaled a sweet deep perfume in the lighted quiet . She hugged them to her gently , kissed the cool lip of a lily . They had cost her a lot , but flowers were expensive at Easter . She hoped the87The Listenerman who listened in the other room liked flowers too . They were all she had to give him . He must be a good man , she thought . She 'd read about him in the papers .

She had n't fulfilled her Easter duty for  --  how long ? Ten years . Ten long years . How could she tell a priest that ? Why , she was probably excommunicated by now ! And she was afraid of the priests in this big city ; they looked so sure and sharp and quick . Enough to scare a country girl to death . Very educated , not slow and easy and kind-looking like Father Stephen , who had all the time in the world to listen to you and help you .

He 'd be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing had been O.K. since she was sixteen years old , when Mom died and Pa just disappeared and all the little kids were sent to the orphanage .

At least now she had these flowers for the Man who Listens . She was twenty-eight years old , and plump and pretty , 88The Magdalenewith thick yellow hair , light blue eyes , and a square , tender face full of delicate color . She did not know she was pretty . She had scoffed at Phil when he had told her , and at Francis . Francis . Tears came into her eyes , and she fumbled for her handkerchief . The chime sounded softly , and she got up and carried her flowers into the white and empty room . She did not know what she had expected , but certainly not this suffused quiet , these white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting marble chair . She sat down fearfully , clutching her flowers . " I hope , " she murmured , " that someone 's here . They say someone always is . You , I guess . How could you be here all the time ? Did you read my note ? " There was no sound ; it was like a church when there was no one there . But all at once Mary knew she was not alone . She smiled tremulously . " I should n't be here , " she said . " Not a girl like me . You wo n't want me here when I tell you . My name 's Mary Lanska . I sort of feel I should change it to Maggie or something . It 's a crying shame my name 's Mary . " A large tear , hot and burning , ran down her cheek . She gulped . " It was after Mom died and the kids went to the orphanage . I was sixteen and kind of independent , and I looked eighteen , almost . Mom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep house . So I got myself a job as a maid . Oh yes , that was in the little town where I come from , eighty miles from here . Rich people by the name of Mallon . He was a banker , Mr. Mallon , and owned practically everything in89The Listener The Magdalenetown . He was n't a good man , in the way I mean it . I do n't mean he drank or ran around  --  after all , he was kind of old , about fifty . And he did n't beat up his old lady , the way my pa beat up Mom , and he did n't wallop Phil around , either . But Phil  --  that 's his son  --  was nineteen , and too big , I guess . Four girls in the family , but Phil was the only boy . I never liked any of them but Phil . He was the only decent one . I still say so ! " And she lifted her square and dimpled chin firmly . " No , Mr. Mallon was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank when he had a good customer . He did a lot for his church , too , I heard , but you ca n't buy God , can you ? Sister M. Benedict said God was the only thing you could n't buy in this world . She was sure right ! " Well , anyway , Phil was n't the strong type . So he did n't go away to school ; he had a tutor and then went to the privateschool in the town . And then it was time for him to go to college . How old lady Mallon cried ! You 'd think Phil was going to his own funeral . And I cried , too , when I was alone at night . What would I do without Phil ? " For you see , Phil and I loved each other . We really loved each other . No one can tell me different , no sir ! " She shook her head vigorously . " I loved him the minute I saw him . A real doll . Big and thin , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair . And how he could talk ! It made stars sparkle in your heart . When he kissed me for the first time  --  it was a few days after I started to work there  --  I thought I 'd die . I really did . " The tears were coming faster now , but unheeded. 90 " No one in the world had ever kissed me before , except Mom , and that was when I was confirmed . No boy , no man . Nobody but Mom and Phil . I thought I 'd die . Oh , I 'd read the movie and romance magazines , and I knew all about love , even if I did n't get all the big words in the magazines . Why , it was better with Phil than I 'd ever dreamed ! It was like a dream , and I mean it . " Her voice dropped . " I guess it was all wrong , if you think about it , but nobody 'd ever told me . Mom had too many of us to take care of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you know , I was a big girl of sixteen , looking almost eighteen , and I did n't even know how a lady got a baby ! Honest , I did n't . I just never thought of it ; that shows you how stupid I was , with all the kids we had in the house . I never gave it a thought . " Well , Phil started coming up to my room after everybody was in bed , and it was like a dream . I was so happy . I guess that was what it was  --  I was happy . I 'd never been happy before . And in that little town they did n't keep kids in school until they were grown , the way they do now . Especially not kids like us . I left school when I was thirteen ; Mom needed me . So all at once , there was Phil , and stars and being happy , and love . Sometimes I thought I 'd burst , I was so happy . " Well , still , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't right . So I stopped going to confession . Anyway , Father Stephen was dead by then . I could n't go to confession and say to the new priest , I think maybe I 'm doing something wrong . ' And then tell him . I was afraid he 'd tell me I had to stop , and then I would n't be happy any more . I91The Listenercould n't live without that happiness , and Phil , and him stroking my hair on the pillow and telling me I was pretty and that I was all his love and there was never going to be anyone else . And I 'm sure he meant it ! Yes sir , I 'm sure of that ! We were going to be married when he was twenty-one and out from under his old man 's thumb , and with a job . I 'd say to him , Your pa wo n't want you to marry me . ' And he 'd laugh and say , Who cares ? Besides , I 'm only nineteen , and I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but us . ' He was always right . It was the only way . " She paused . Her blue eyes widened as she stared at the curtain , and she shrank . " Oh ! Maybe you 're a priest ! Maybe you want me to get out after what I told you ? Should I get out ? " The light beamed all about her . She listened intently . No voice answered her , but she was suddenly reassured that she could stay . She sighed over and over . " Well , thank you , " she murmured . She looked at the flowers on her knee , tall and fresh and sweet , and she smiled sadly . " Then Phil had to go away to college . Do n't write me , ' he said . If you do I 'll have to answer , and someway they 'll find out . Just remember I love you , and I 'll be thinking of you every minute . ' Of course he was right . So I 'd lie alone at night , dreaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , but I was afraid that God would be offended . I was beginning to be scared of Him , anyway . I guess that 's the way you feel when you know you 're doing something wrong . I 'm not sayingI did n't know by then ; I did . I wrote to this woman in92The Magdalenethe newspaper and did n't sign my name , just Polly . ' And she answered it in the newspaper and she said I should leave your place of employment at once ! Go to a relative , or a close friend , or your clergyman . ' That 's what she said . The only thing was I did n't have no relatives or close friends , and if I went to the priest he 'd tell me never to see Phil again , and how could I stand that ? I loved him ; he was all I had . " I thought he 'd be home for Thanksgiving , but there was this football game , and the whole family went to the college town to be with Phil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! He was playing football ! They came back , and I 'd listen , and they 'd say , What a wonderful improvement in dear Phil . ' That was his mother and sisters . The sisters were all older'n me and had a lot of boy friends , and one was engaged . About time , too ; she was twenty-six , the oldest . Married one of the men in the bank . " Well , there was Christmas coming , and Phil would be home . Except he was n't . You 'd think the family would be mad , would n't you ? But they were n't . It seems like he 'd met some son of a big shot from Philadelphia , and they 'd invited Phil for the holidays . He was Phil 's best friend .

" And then I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . It ached all the time , day and night . Mom died of heart trouble , and I went to a doctor . He charged me five93The Listenerdollars , and I was only getting ten a week . He said I did n't have a heart condition . It 's all in your mind , young lady , ' he joked , and pinched my cheek . Some boy , eh ? Well , go home to Mother and play the field . I do n't approve of this going steady at your age . Seventeen ? Too young . Just you go out with all the nice boys you can , and dance and have fun and wear your pretty clothes and stay close to Dad and Mother for some time yet . ' Much he knew about me ! Anyway , the pain would n't go away . It was like something eating at my heart all the time . " Did you ever have a pain like that , loving somebody so hard ? A friend , maybe , or your mother or your father ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't ? Well , it was that way with me . And Phil did n't come home for the spring vacation . He did n't come home until June . Nine long months . " But the minute I saw him I knew he still loved me , and that 's all that mattered . He came up to my room the very first night he was home , and it was like he 'd never gone away . Every night , the whole time he was home , when he could . He 'd filled out ; he was a man and not a boy , twenty years old . I was so proud of him , and so happy . Why , even the air had sparkles in it ! And we had only one year to go before we could be married . " Mary wept deeply into her handkerchief . She could notstop for a long time . Then her face was flushed and swollen . She glanced furtively at her cheap watch . Why , it was halfpastone ! It was Easter morning . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a leaf of the flowers . " That boy he met at94The Magdalenecollege , he came in the summer , and Phil was out a lot with him , showing him off , his sisters said . The youngest sister sure had her eye on him , and she had no looks at all . Like a plucked chicken . She used to stare at my hair , and she said I bleached it ! I never bleached it in my life , and then the old lady swooped down on me and examined the roots of my hair . Like I was n't human , or something , and she could do what she wanted to me . I wanted to kick her hard . But that meant I would n't be there any more , and maybe new people would find out about Phil and they would n't let him come and stay with me . " Well , it was n't like the first summer . Phil was out and around ; the family made him go . And then in August he went off to sail on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think , by the way his family acted , that he 'd been elected President . But before he went he came up to my room on the last night , and it was like in the very beginning , and he kept whispering how much he loved me . And he gave me the first present I ever had . The prettiest compact . I bet it cost all of six dollars , maybe even more . It looked like gold and silver . I still got it . " Phil did n't come home that Thanksgiving , either , and then the whole stupid family was invited to Philadelphia , and you never heard such a noise . Laughing and yelling and hugging each other . That was for Christmas . And Phil did n't come home in the spring , and then not in June . The family was whispering around , but I could n't hear what they said . He came home in July for just four weeks . I was eighteen then , and he was twenty-one , and we could be married . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her95The Listenertears flow , down onto the flowers , down onto her cheap but sturdy winter coat and neat dark blue dress . " Again it was like the beginning , those four weeks . And I 'd say to him , We can be married now , Phil . ' And he 'd kiss me hard on the mouth and say , Just be patient . ' And I was . And then at the end of that four weeks his engagementto that boy 's sister showed up in the newspaper . " Mary 's color ran from her cheeks at the remembrance of that old agony . " I thought I 'd lose my mind , " she said , her voice hoarse and low . " I thought I 'd just lose my mind . I could n't work . I said I was sick , and I went upstairs to my room and lay down on the bed . Maybe I fainted , or maybe I slept . I do n't know . But I kept waking up and saying , Oh , thank God it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 'd come back to me , like a knife in my chest . I kept thinking I was dying , and then I was scared , thinking of God and how angry He was with me , and this was my punishment and I 'd end up in hell for sure . No one wanted me now , not Phil , not God . Nobody . " She could see the curtains through her tears . " Well , all that day I was sick and just about dying . And then I could n't go down and get dinner , and I could hear the old lady grumbling . I 'd lift my head , and then I 'd have to run into the bathroom and throw up . Phil was n't around . I waited and waited , and it got dark , and then the house was full of company ; I could hear them laughing and shouting ; I could hear Phil , too . I sat up and told myself it was a mistake . If it was true , and the old man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together . I 'd saved a little money , and Phil had a big allowance . I just had to wait for Phil . " And right about one in the morning he came to my room in his pajamas , like always , and I was in his arms , and I was almost out of my mind again . He kept putting his hand over my mouth and then trying to close it with kisses . He kept saying , Hush , hush , it 'll be all right . You 'll see . ' And I was so sick , and so tired . Then suddenly I was happy again . Phil would take care of everything . I 'd just about fallen asleep , I was so tired , when the light flashed on , and there was the old man . " Mary shuddered and cringed and squeezed her eyes together . " It was awful , " she whispered . " I pulled up the sheet around me , and Phil jumped out of bed and pulled on his pajamas , and the old man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And he looked at me ! I never had anyone look at me like that ! And he said , The evil woman taken in adultery . You dirty tramp , in a better age than this they 'd stone you to death . Get out of this house at once , you filthy creature . ' " And Phil kept saying , Now , Dad , please , Dad , it 's all right , Dad . Do n't shout like that . You 'll have Mother and the girls up here . Please , Dad . It 's all right . ' And all I was afraid of was that the old man would punch him . But he did n't . He kept looking at me , like he hated me like death , and he said , My poor boy , seduced by this vile wretch who dared to sleep in a house where innocent young girls are sleeping . My poor boy . Go to your room . ' I almost laughed ; I never wanted to laugh so much in my life , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You ca n't put her out now , Dad . It 's almost morning . What will people say ? ' And the old man nodded and said , You are quite right . But you , ' he said to me , be out of the house before my daughters get up . Mary sobbed , her yellow hair flying about her face . " You know what I said to him ? Mr. Mallon , I 've got my savings in your bank . Three hundred dollars . ' And he said , Be there when the bank opens , and if you are in this town by five o'clock I 'll have the police after you . ' And he meant it , too . And I said to Phil  --  he was looking so white and sort of green around the mouth  --  I 'll be in the bus station at four o'clock , ' and I tried to smile at him so he would n't look so sick . " Mary looked at the curtains again in vague fear . " You are listening , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And look , it 's half-past three . Easter morning . When Our Lord rises from the dead . Oh , I should n't even speak about Him ! I 've got no right to , a woman like me . Why , He 'd turn me away , would n't He ? Like  --  like  --  it was something I read in the Holy Bible --  No , He did n't turn the woman away . I wish I could remember the whole story . " Well , I got my money out of the bank , and I was in my best dress , with a short white coat and hat , and I had my suitcase , and I was happy again . Phil would meet me at the bus station at four , and we 'd leave town at five . I ate a big breakfast , then I was sick at the stomach again and had to throw up in the ladies ' room . But I was happy just the same . I sat in the bus station the whole day , reading a magazine. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to the door and watched for Phil . And then it was half-past four , and quarter to five , and they were loading the bus for this city . And Phil did n't come . So I ran to the telephone , and the old lady answered it , and though I tried to disguise my voice she knew it , and she screamed at me about the police and hung up , and I knew Phil could n't come ; maybe they had him locked up in his room and they would n't let him out . I got on the bus and I came to this city , and I found myself a room in a cheap hotel , and then I wrote to Phil , telling him where I was . " But they must have opened my letters . He never wrote me , and he never came to me . And after a month I knew I 'd never see him again . I got a good job as a waitress . That was ten years ago .

' And quick as a wink I said Mrs. Mallon . ' And then it hit me . I do n't even remember getting back to the rooming house where I lived . " I thought and thought . God did n't want me . Phil could n't come to me . I did n't want to hurt him . His father would have killed him . I even thought of killing myself . And then I got this good job I have now , and I told people my husband was in the Army and I was Mrs. Mallon . I was , in99The Listener my heart . All the time . And that 's what they know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dear little boy , and I called him Phil , after his father , and the people in the hospital mailed letters I wrote to Mr. Phil Mallon in the Army . But I did n't put any return address on them . I was getting smart by now . And I paid everything myself . " I got my little boy out in the country , where all the little kids should live , with the grass and the trees and flowers and fresh air . I pay good for him , too . He 's a darling little boy . And everything would be all right , except that a year ago I met Francis Lewis . He 's a young farmer , and it 's a big farm , and he 's all alone on it since his dad died a couple of years ago . He came in the restaurant ; he 'd just brought his beef cattle in . And right away we liked each other , and he came back and took me out . " Mary shivered . " And now you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a young Army widow with a little boy , and he believed it . It did n't matter at first . And then I sort of began to think of him . He 's so good and kind . I do n't feel for him like I felt for poor Phil , who could n't come to me and who does n't even know he has a little boy nearly ten years old . Imagine that ! Not knowing you have a child ! I just ache for Phil . " Then Francis asked me to marry him , and I thought of being his wife , safe on that nice farm , with somebody to care about me again , and how wonderful it would be for little Phil , and we 'd be all together . And then I thought what a cheat I was , and so I had to tell Francis , and I knew that would be the end . But do you know something ? It io0 The Magdalenewas n't ! No sir , Francis is that kind of man ; he 's thirty-two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my little boy  --  my Phil . And he said , It does n't matter , Mary . I will just be marrying a young widow with a child . We 'll have to keep that up , for the boy 's sake and ours . ' That 's the kind of man Francis is . " Her young face suddenly glowed , and she smiled . Then her smile went away . " But how can I do that to Francis ? He deserves a better girl than me , somebody good and nice . We 'd have to be married in the Church , and I 'd have to go to confession , and what will the priest say ? He 'd say just what God would say , and old man Mallon . So I 'm holding off , and I wo n't take a ring yet , and here I am . " She waited . The room was still shimmering with light , and it was almost dawn . " Tell me ! " cried Mary in despair .

Mary stumbled to her feet . She extendedthe flowers . " I brought these for you . They 're so pretty ; Madonna lilies , too . Take them . " She crept to the curtains , read the brass plate , then touched the button , her whole body shaking . The curtains fell apart , and she fell back , uttering a great and terrified cry . She looked at the man before her , and she trembled more and more . The light appeared to grow stronger , more triumphant . Mary bowed her head . She whispered , " Will you take my flowers ? They 're all I have to give you . Maybe , because of all my sins , I should'veforThe Listenergiven the money to charity or something . But I want you to have them . Will you take them ? Please ?

Yes , I loved very much , and I love again . " You want me to have Francis and my little boy , do n't you ? Yes , that 's what you want ! Oh , I 'll be so good to them both ! " She swallowed her tears . " And there was another Mary , and a man she thought was the gardener --  And now I know no priest will ever turn me away . He would n't . He would n't !

He was very popular among them and saw them regularly , and not only at the club . In fact , he had never been so popular . It was a mark of a wellroundedpersonality if people liked you ; at least he was no neurotic . Even Dr. Bergson had assured him of that .

Once or twice , lately ( but only once or twice ! ) , he had forgotten to keep his voice modulated in the club when some ass had made a gently sneering remark and had mentioned " bad taste , these days . " The young man 's heart had suddenly pounded then , his cool face had flushed , and he had been guilty  --  that was the only word for it , guilty  --  of raising his voice a little vehemently . The older men in the locker room at the club had looked disturbed but serious , and one or two had nodded ; but the younger , his close friends , had appeared startled and embarrassedand had hurriedly changed the subject , as if to spare his shame and cover up his social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?

" No one answered him , but he was convinced that he had heard those words . He said as if his thoughts had been spoken aloud and heard in entirety : " Of course , there in the locker room , I was guilty of a faux pas . In a way . That was no place for discussion . My study is the place . And my pulpit . For you see , I am a minister , and I have one of the largest and most desirable parishes in this city . I am the Reverend Mr. Anson Carr . So if you are a clergyman you will see we have much in common . " He laughed with a carefully cultivated ease . It was strange , and purely imaginary , certainly , that he should have the impression of a gentle smiling , a sense of107The Listener @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ease now , as if in the company of an older colleague to whom he could speak frankly . " I was right to come , " he admitted . " I suspected that you were of the cloth , ' as my grandmother used to call it . There is a Mrs. Merrill Sloane in my congregation , a lady for whom I had had little sympathy two years ago because of her variouspersonality defects . A most remarkable change has come over her , and I hinted I 'd be interested to learn what had accomplished this . She told me only that she had been here to see you , and then she said  --  that was a month or more ago  --  Do go yourself , Mr. Carr . It is just what you need . ' I must admit that I was disturbed at this ; I was n't aware that I needed ' anything . Not anything that was visible to my congregation , at least . If a woman once so self-centered as Mrs. Sloane was aware of my need , ' then it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offended , but that is the reason I am here : to find how to conceal some of my  --  thoughts  --  from my congregation . " He paused . His headache was becoming very ferocious . He took a beautifully enameled pillbox from his pocket and slipped a tablet on his tongue and swallowed with a little difficulty . " Not that I will have a congregation much longer , " he said , clearing his throat . " I have no right to it . For you see , I am dry . Dry as death , dry to the very marrow of my bones . Like David , I cry out to my God from the darkest depths , and there is no answer . Have I lost my faith ? I do n't know . Perhaps . It is as if I 've been working for years on a desert , io8excavating parched bones and presenting them as living forms . A desert . Dry bones .

" My family was very pious , even though my father was a successful businessman and very popular and belonged to all the best clubs in this city  --  I am a member too . We had prayers every evening , as well as prayers before our meals . Father used to lead us in the Bible reading and in the prayers . He was , I suppose , a very oldfashionedman . I worshiped him .

I think we should consult an expert on aptitude tests and then109The Listenera psychiatrist before you commit your life to any  --  profession . ' " He waited . No one answered him . Then something rose in him like the high and thundering swell of a wave . He fought it down , but it rose high and higher , and out of its smothering he cried , " Profession !

" To think that there were people long ago who thought God called ' them ! Now we gravely consider the impulse we have toward the ministry and wonder if we are well rounded enough , and fully psychologically educated , and adjusted , to become ministers of the Gospel ! Are we good administrators ? Do we like people ? Do people instinctively like us ? Are we excellently grounded in the socialethic ? Do young people naturally gravitate toward us ? Are we expert businessmen ? Do women like us ? Are we liberal in our ideas ? Do we have good voices which inspire confidence ? Can we meet men on their own ground easily and confidently , whether it is the golf course , the broker 's office , the club , the family living room , the parish hall , the community activities , the schools , the theater , the good restaurants ? In short , are we good fellows , sweet guys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take an active part in them ? Are we broad ' ? Men of diversified ' interests ? Conversant with television ?

" In short , " he cried , " must we be everything but ministers of the Gospel ? " The white walls were lined with his questions . He stared at them . He shrank . He fumbled for the chair and sat down again . He was breathing in short gasps . He looked at the curtain . " You probably know , " he said . " As a clergyman , you probably know . You can see , surely , what confronts every minister , a pastor , a shepherd . " The room appeared to become cold , the light glacial . " It 's not my fault , " said the minister . " Not my fault . It is what they want . I give it to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a groaning voice , " It is killing me . " He waited . Then he said roughly , " You are probably a very successful clergyman .

You never tell them about their sin ' ! You never rebuke them . No minister would dare , these days . " Do you know that no one speaks of sin these days ? Except , of course , the Roman Catholic priests and perhaps a scattered Orthodox rabbi here and there ? There is no sin . ' It 's a matter of environment , of conditioning , of lack of opportunity , of society 's oppression . ' Of broken homes . Of racial discrimination . Of bad housing . Of slum conditions .

There is no sin . Man , as Rousseau said , is sinless . Only the institutions around him provoke anti-social behavior , for which we must be compassionate , surrounding the sinner with help .

Not our congregations who gather on Sunday morningwell shaved , well brushed , well dressed , well furred , happy with themselves . And those of us who are ministers to the poor dare not call our people sinners , ' either . The damned social workers would be rushing in , in droves , in their fluttering black skirts and ballet slippers and fierce little faces , screaming about discrimination ' and what chance ' did our congregation have in this competitive society .

There would not be a church standing if we dared to say that ! " He dropped his head . Then he said , " But first we must say that to ourselves . Yes , first of all to ourselves , we the false shepherds , who led our people into the papier-mache valleys of complacency , who laid mirrors in the earth , instead of living water , so that our people could contemplate themselves with self-congratulation , who spread carpets of artificial green grass for them , steam-heated , on which they could bask and forget the earthquakes rumbling below them .

He could hardly get his breath . His head pounded violently . It was some time before he could speak , and then only faintly . " What picture do I have of myself ?

But did you ever have a flock like mine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hurrying , grasping , smirking , preening , authori- ties on everything , greedy , betrayers , hard-eyed , coveting so- cial honors , doubters , atheists , hypocrites , adulterers , sports-115The Listenermen , lovers of the trivial and the passing , sheepish before the mention of God 's name ? Did you ? If you did not , then you ca n't answer me and you ca n't help me ! " He ran to the curtains , his head roaring , his finger outstretchedtoward the button . The curtains rushed aside . Mr. Carr stood and looked in the light . Then he stepped back slowly , foot by groping foot . And then he fell to his knees . " Yes , " he said , " of course you did . That is the flock you had , and that is the flock I have , We have them together ; we have them together . Until the end of time , we have them together . You and I. " But you never had to say to yourself , I am the guilty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guilty . God , be merciful to me , a sinner . " Give me strength to tell my people the truth . If they reject me , as they rejected vou , what does it matter ? There is only the truth . Forgive me . Above all things , forgive me . For betraying you in trivialities .

We slowly drove , he knew no haste , And I had put awayMy labour , and my leisure too , For his civility . Emily Dickinson : " The Chariot " 116SOUL EIGHTEugene Emory walked stiffly into the sitting room , saw those waiting in silence , and hesitated . How placid they were , like cattle , some reading a magazine , some only staring at nothing . Like people in an anteroom of the Salvation Army ! Why had he come here ? That specialist who had given him the irrevocable news , finally ! What had he said ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're very proud of old John Godfrey 's place . I 've seen some remarkable things . No , I was never there myself . But you must have read about it . He had . In one of the big national magazines . A beautiful square building , set in flower gardens , with trees and arbors  --  the finest architects had built it . It was open twenty-four hours a day to everybody and anybody . " The Man who Listens . " The reporter in that magazine had been a very amusing boy , full of mocking wide-eyes and arched brows119The Listenerand rounded , contemptuous mouth . " Ooh , " he seemed to be saying in every clever paragraph . " Ooh . Ooh ! The lame , the halt , the blind  --  come one , come all . Find your particular nostrum here , your own face , your own voice . That 's what they say . Your reporter did enter the inner sanctum of sanctums and asked a lot of questions aloud . That big , bright , melodramatic curtain just would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know ; I tried . Velvet over steel mesh , apparently , which could only be parted by electrical impulse , and the boys had shut the juice off . Everybody welcome , except a reporter whose job it is to expose sham , cheapness , brash popularity , vulgarity , and pretense . Why the clergy have n't denounced it is one of the continuing wonders of the years . " The colored photographs , however , had been exceedingly handsome , the pictured gardens exquisite , the paths carefullytended , the trees luxurious . No walls or fences guarded the four acres of land , and though the grounds were in the very center of a very populous part of the city , it had never been reported that any vandalism had been committed here , except an attempted robbery a few times , scattered over the years . The reporter had been particularly annoyed and skeptical , because no donations were solicited and none accepted . He scattered a few dark rumors for public speculation . The governor of the state , after reading that article , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about old John 's structure , for he had been there himself one quiet night . But the public " clamored " for the investigation , the governorsaid apologetically , though he failed to notice that the12oThe Condemnedclamor did not come from the city itself , or even the state , but from towns and villages and cities in far parts of the country . The governor found " nothing wrong . " It was a quiet , restful place where you could think , he announced . A quiet , restful place , thought Eugene Emory as he sat down . Just what I need now ! A quiet , restful place , closely resembling a grave . And these are my companions , these dolt-faced women and men , waiting . He saw that one by one , in perfect silence and composure , they rose at the chimingof a bell , opened the oaken door , and disappeared from sight . That was all . My God , what am I doing here ? thought Eugene Emory , thinking of what he must tell his wife tomorrow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had worked all his life , worked while going to high school , worked while going to the university in his home city . He had known nothing but work all his life . He had not resented that until a month ago , or was it two months ? Then his resentment had reached fury . He had been so enraged that he had lost two of his easiest cases in court , and the judge , his friend , had looked at him with concern . Three days later he had looked at him sternly and had called him to account with a threat of punishment for contempt of court . Emory , Dean and Hartfordhad lost face through him , he who had established the firm . Jack Dean , his best friend , had told him that he looked sick and that he was perhaps too tired . " I 've been feeling like a sick pup , " he had finally admitted . " I suppose I need a vacation . Have n't had one in eight years ; no time . You121The Listenerought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and maybe we can plan something , a cruise or a trip to Europe . " His wife had been joyful over the idea , but first she had insisted that he see the family physician for a thorough examination . " I hardly know the man , " he had protested . " I only know his bills , and that 's enough ! What are you doing here , running a hospital ? " But Emily could not be turned aside and , fuming , he had gone to the physician . " I have only an hour to spare , " he told the doctor immediately on entering the examination room . " I 'm very busy , you know . How are you ? " he added as a belated thought . Had he ever seen this competent youngish man before ? He seemed vaguely familiar . At the club ? In his house ? " I 'm all right . But I do n't think you are , " said the doctor , looking at the ghostly face of his patient , the gray lines under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the ashen color of his thin lips . " Well , we 'll soon see . " Tests , tappings , soundings , breathings , bendings , listening . The hour was up , but the doctor had not finished . " I must go , " said Eugene impatiently . " Yes , " said the doctor with grave thoughtfulness . " But just to be sure , I want you to see Dr. Hampshire in this same building . He 's the blood specialist , you know . I want to be absolutely sure . " " Of what ? " " Of something I suspect . Of course I may be wrong . I hope I am . How long , by the way , has it been since you had that attack of tonsillitis ? " 122The Condemned " Two months ago . How did you know I had that attack ? " Eugene became alert . The doctor said evasively , " And you had swellings under your jaw line , too ? " " Yes ! What was it ? Strep ? I took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kids . Look , do I have to go to this Dr. Hampshire ? " " Yes . Right now . You may call your office from here , if you wish , and tell them you 've been delayed . And I 'll call Dr. Hampshire . " " Ca n't I make it next week , or after we come back from our cruise ? " The doctor did not say , " You 'll probably never come back from that cruise . " Instead he said , as if after giving the matterthought , " No , I 'd feel better about it if you had the examinationnow . For Emily 's sake . She 's been worried about you for weeks . " This was another surprise . So they were on a first-name basis , were they ? And why had Emily been worried ? Of course he had lost some weight , suddenly and very recently , and he had been feeling sudden exhaustions and palpitations , and there had been that day when he had vomited after breakfast and had thrown up some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of success , as they said . " Ulcers ? " he said to the doctor . " Why do you ask that ? " " Never mind . " If he told about that blood there 'd be more delays , and barium meals and X rays ; he knew all about123The Listenerit . Young Hartford had ulcers , and his descriptions had been graphic . " I 've never been sick a day in my life , " said Eugene as he dressed . " Good , " said the doctor . He waited until he was certain that Eugene was on his way to see Dr. Hampshire , and then the young doctor called his older colleague . " Eugene Emory , " he said . " I 've known him for years , but he hardly notices anybody . He 's tough . He can take it . Leukemia . But I 'd like to make sure . Acute , I 'm afraid . " He attempted to laugh , feebly . " Try to make it chronic , will you , Ed ? Then perhaps we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the advances made in the treatment of leukemia . Sometimes life could be prolonged , even in such devastating acute cases . But it was a life under absolute sentence of death . Of course , thought the doctor , we all live under sentence of death , but so long as we are n't aware of it all the time we can forget it . People with leukemia , though , can never forget it . Not even in fantasy . Less than an hour later Eugene Emory returned . He sat at the young doctor 's desk , and there was death in his face . He said , " I do n't believe it . " " You must , Eugene . If you have any affairs that need puttingin order  --  you ca n't evade the fact that you are going to die . And too soon , I 'm afraid . " Eugene said nothing . He lit a cigarette with pale thin fingers . He stared over the doctor 's head . " We begin to die the moment we are conceived , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die . I may die tonight , underThe Condemnedthe wheels of an automobile , or next year , of a coronary thrombosis , or tomorrow , falling down those damned steep steps at our club . Death is something we ca n't escape . The only thing that 's wrong with it is that we do n't begin to tell our children about it in the very earliest childhood , so that they will live with the fact and think of it regularly , so that it becomes familiar to them and not something terrible , or something which , through mysterious luck , they can avoid . Not to tell a little child all about death  --  and the hell with the psychic trauma ' of it !  --  is about the most cruel thing you can do to the child . To tell him soothingly that only the very old die is to make a liar of yourself , and the child will soon find out and despise you . And children are born tough and resilient ; they are n't fragile flowers who must be protected from life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naturally than we can ; it becomes harder for us every year . " He added , " Death is as much a part of life as birth . " " I never lived , " said Eugene , as if talking to himself . " Inever knew how to live ; I only knew how to work . " He stood up . " How long ? " " A month , perhaps . With luck , perhaps two months . But no longer . " " There 's nothing you can do ? " " Various things . But they 're not too successful in acute cases ; they work best in the chronic . How do you like the idea of going into the hospital today , for blood transfusions , radiations , and so on ? " Eugene gave it thought . His face became more ghastly by124 125The Listenerthe moment . He passed his hand over his fading light hair . " Why should I ? " he said . " Well , it might make you a little more comfortable --  " " And that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until I die ? " " Yes . " " Then , no . I 'll keep on going until I have to stop . It will make it easier on my family , too . By the way , am I going to run into any  --  trouble ? " " Probably . I 'll give you some tablets to relieve the pain . You said you 've been having pain over your bones . It may or may not get worse . " The doctor hesitated . " Why do n't you talk to the minister of your church ? " " I do n't know him , " said Eugene flatly . " I 've only seen him in his pulpit at Christmas and Easter . But Emily knows him well , and the children . " " Why do n't you talk to him about this yourself ? " " Thank you , no . I 'm not going crawling to --  You know what I mean . " The really furious , incredulous , and helpless rage had begunthen . It was all the more terrible in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logical mind , his factual experiences . Always he had been able to control his life , to direct it , to fight circumstance and overcome it , to turn things aside . He knew that his juniors called him " The Univac , " and it had amused him . He had only to appear in a courtroom , quick and light-footed , his face concentrated in an expression of single-mindedness , to make the opposing126The Condemnedlawyer 's heart sink . He rarely lost a case , and those only the most desperate . His life , his work were in full control , in absolute order , full of precision . He hated fuzziness . He would often say , " There 's nothing inevitable . " Now he was faced with the inevitable . The rage increased . It was not a frightened , quivering rage , a pusillanimous one . It was the rage of a man who has never lived , and when he is on the threshold of living his life is taken from him . He had known for the past two years that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children were almostadults now , and they would soon be leaving home . Once a son or daughter left home for school , he or she really never came home again , except as a visitor . Eugene was not a " dedicated " man , as others called him approvingly . He had wanted money only to guarantee him and his family a reasonable amount of security , and he had accomplished that now . And next came pleasure , and travel , and leisure , for himself and Emily . His wife had not been lonely or unhappy or neglected . She had known for what he was working so strongly and admired him for it . When he had suggested the cruise a few days ago she had said , " Really ? Wonderful ! Now we can begin to enjoy ourselves , ca n't we , darling ? While we 're still young and healthy . " They had spent hours that night planning the cruise . All over South America ; they would sail in October and so would have two months to prepare . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not return from the cruise until just before Christmas . " And then , in February , we 're going to Florida , " said Eugene . He had kissed his pretty127The Listener The Condemnedwife , whose dark brown hair was so glossy and fresh . " It 's time we lived . And now we 've got all the time in the world . I 'll get busy with arrangements at the office . " He now had no time at all . A month . Two months . He did not tell his wife . He could so control himself that when she talked enthusiastically about the cruise and gave him more colorful pamphlets he could bring up a convincing and interested smile . They had their passport pictures taken ; they applied for passports . Eugene had never been very ruddy of complexion ; his deepening pallor only made his wife believe that the cruise was really very urgent . He had always been thin . She bought extra vitamins for him and gave him eggnog at bedtime . He indulged her lovingly . He could express @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quick half-ashamed embrace , but she knew how he loved her . She never saw the little tablet he occasionally took now when his physical distress was overpowering . She never knew that he went to a private hospital with his doctor for an occasional blood transfusion " to make you a little more comfortable . " She thought he slept at night . He did , sometimes , after a drug . And then one day he realized that two weeks had passed , or was it three ? He had more blood tests . " We 're holding our own a little , " said the doctor . " A reprieve ? " " Well  --  you ca n't always tell with this damned thing . " " The governor wo n't call three minutes before mid-night ? " " No . Have you told Emily yet ? " 128 " No . I do n't want her to know . Until at the very last , perhaps the last hour . " " You could die in your sleep . " " All the better , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as usual . If he spent an hour or two now and then on the couch in his office , there was little comment . He had told his partners , " I have some kind of anemia . I have to take liver shots for them . Nothing serious , but I need considerable rest . Now , the latter part of October  --  we have the Hadley case coming up , and I wo n't be here . " I wo n't be here . Sometimes he thought of killing himself , in a way that would appear to be an accident , for Emily 's sake . But he was a lawyer , and he knew all about the clever probings of insurance companies . And there was the police , too . He had nowhere to turn . He had no hobbies and few friends . He tried to read , for reading had always been his best pleasure . But he would find himself staring blankly at a page for five or ten minutes at a time , unaware of it . Emily was busily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress and turn about for his admiration . Then he would take her hand and kiss it quickly , and put it from him as quickly . Oh , God , he would say in himself , but with blasphemy . A less disciplined man would have broken down . He almostdid when Emily insisted on his buying some clothing for the cruise . " I love this dark blue twill , " she said . He129The Listener The Condemnedbought it . He almost remarked in his desperate rage , " Bury me in it . " He tried to drink . His drinking had always been sparing . But he could take no more than two drinks , for then he becamenauseated and he was afraid of vomiting and precipitatinga fatal hemorrhage . Four weeks . He was still alive . " Still holding our own a little , " said the doctor . " For how much longer ? " The doctor did not answer . Then he read of a certain blood specialist who was doing some excellent work in prolonging the lives of leukemia victims . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I will be back on Wednesday , " he said . He had seen the specialist . The doctor could give him no hope . He was dying . He could die any day now . He thought of Emily waiting for him in their pleasant suburban home . His strength became less . He must tell her , prepare her . Then while waiting for the time to leave for the airport he took a short walk in the late August sunlight in this city where John Godfrey had built his marble temple . Eugene stopped to look at the gardens , then he saw the building and remembered the story of it which he had read some time ago . His white mouth trembled with disgust . He found himself walking up one of the winding red gravel paths , and then he was in the sitting room , waiting with these placid , uninteresting people . Waiting for what ? The specialist had told him to come here ; he had forgotten the advice almost immediately . But subconsciously he must have been drawn to it. 130If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then I 'm pretty far gone in my intellect . He had a habit now of falling into brief dozes . He heard a chiming and he started , awake . He was the only one in the room now , and he knew it was his turn . The Man who Listens . Eugene stood up , then looked at the outer door and took a step toward it . He stopped . He had nothing to lose . And he might find some amusement here . He entered the white room with its marble chair and curtainedalcove . What ? he thought . No crystal ball ? No swami ? No mystical lights and floating trumpets ? And why all this light ? Were n't they afraid their fakery would be discovered ? He had n't put a note in the box . That would give " them " a clue for " the spirits , " so the properly muted answer could be returned . " I do n't , " he said to the curtain alcove , " believe in spiritualism . I do n't believe in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know that when I am dead I am finally , thoroughly , dead . " He did not sit down . He walked about the gleaming white room as he walked about a courtroom , outlining his case , his hands in his pockets . " I do n't know who you are behind those curtains , " he said . " Moreover , I do n't care . Doctor , clergyman , psychiatrist . There is nothing any of you can do for me now . I am dying . I may be dead tonight , tomorrow . But I will certainly be dead within a month . I do n't know why I 'm here . All my affairs are in order  --  " He paused , swung about , and stared at the curtains . All131The Listener The Condemnedmy affairs are in order . " What did you say ? " he demanded . Was his mind playing him tricks now ? He thought he had heard : " Are they ? " " All in order , " he repeated . It was hot August outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled with fountains . It was as pleasant a place to wait as any . Or he could walk in the gardens outside ; he had noted , even in his cold anguish , that they were beautifully cared for , and the trees had been exceptionally lush in this August heat , and the paths were evidently thoroughly raked at least once a day , and there had been , along some paths , a suggestion of cool green arbors waiting . Emily would like these gardens . He would  --  he would be dead before the first leaves fell from those trees outside . He would never show Emily these gardens , or any other gardens , anywhere else in the world . " If I have ever had any hobby at all , it was helping Emily in the gardens at home , " he said aloud . " And on Sunday afternoons . I never could understand how she could contrive to have such a massed effect at the end of the lawn , a cypress effect , with heavy shade , and a stone bench to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest , to have a drink , and smoke . Sometimes when it was too hot to sleep we 'd go there , and it was cool . It reminds me of a garden somewhere . I ca n't remember . It was a picture of some garden with cypresses , in the moonlight , and a large flat stone  --  I think there were some figures in the background , sleeping . And someone  --  " He shook his head . " I was only a child then . It must have been in some book . " His heart jumped then , as if suddenly startled or struck , 132and he put his hand on his chest . His logical mind assured him quickly that this was not a physical symptom but an emotion . He could not remember having this emotion before , as of sorrow for someone deeply loved and understood and vanished . The very taste of sadness was on his tongue ; the sickness of grief was heavy in his body . " Now what is wrong ? " he muttered . After a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know why I am here . I am forty-nine years old , married , a successful lawyer , and I have two handsome children , a wife who loves me , and money , and a charming home . But now I must die . I have leukemia . " Why are we permitted , all our lives , to prepare only for life and not for death ? Why do we evade the very thought of death ? Our friends , parents , wives , husbands , children never talk of it . It 's like an obscenity , a subject not mentioned in polite company . Yet it 's around us all the time . Perhaps I would n't feel this way about it  --  this furious rage  --  if I had been taught from childhood to know that it was everywhere . I knew it was everywhere , of course , when I became a man , but like everyone else I had been sedulously protected from its presence . I was never permitted to see my father in his coffin , when he died when I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it was hushed up , like a terrible scandal . When my children asked about it , I grinned at them and hugged them comfortingly . What a fool I was . I should have said to them , You were born so you can die . ' " He stopped and looked challengingly at the curtains . " The child psychologists would disagree . The children must never be hurt . ' They must be protected until they are men . And133The Listenerthen they are suddenly pushed out of the nursery , unpreparednot only for living but especially not for death . Well , I 'm going to do some good with this thing I have . I am going to call my young son and daughter to me tomorrow and say , I am dying . Look at me very carefully and remember what a dying man looks like . Remember that he hates death , and fears it , and is enraged at it . It 's an ugly thing to happen to a man . It will happen to you , sooner or later . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spiritual thoughts . It 's hateful , and it 's the end , and there 's nothing more , except darkness and silence and never thinking again , or laughing , or working . Prepare yourselves for it and accept it . You have no other choice . " He clenched one fist and slapped it hard into the palm of the other hand . " No choice ! We had no choice to be born , we live without a reason for living , and we die as ignorant as the day we were born . But at least if we accept it from the time we can first walk and speak , it will lose some of its terror . Do you agree ? " He thought there was a movement in the room , a flash of light or an increase in light . He shook his head impatiently . And then with wonder . " I 'm not a man of words , except in the courtroom . Why am I talking like this to you , a stranger , in a strange city ? I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't intend to . I am nothing to you ; worse than nothing , for I am dying , and I ca n't stand the thought of it . For just when I can afford to live and know life , it is taken away from me . But why should I tell you ? " 134The CondemnedHe waited . There was no answer . " I think , " he said almost kindly , " that it 's damned decent of you to sit behind that curtain and listen to any stranger who wants to come in and whimper his little tale of woe at you . At least I get paid for it ! " He laughed . " I assume , of course , that you are doing this out of charity . " He heard no movement , no breath . He walked to the curtainand looked at it curiously and read the plate near the button . " Well , I will certainly not push the button and intrude on your privacy , " he said . " Besides , it would embarrassme . I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " He walked again . " I do n't know how old you are or how young . But , good God , do you know what it feels like to be sentenced to death ? Irrevocably sentenced to death , without hope of appeal , without hope at all ? No , you ca n't know . My mind accepts the fact , but something in me refuses to accept it , repudiates it as if it were a lie , a subornation of the truth , the blackest falsehood ever uttered by any man . That is what I ca n't understand . I say to myself , You are dying . Very shortly you will be dead and in your grave , and that will be the end of hoping , loving , life . And light . ' And then something answers me as angrily as if I had another self in me and it wo n't even listen to reason . If there was all acceptancein me , then I could feel more peaceful , more resigned . But something wo n't accept the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is the end . " Of course , " he said thoughtfully , " I suppose that is the old will to live asserting itself in the very face of fact . It ca n't be anything else . " 135The ListenerUp and down he paced , echoing step after step . He was very weary ; his bones ached , and he could feel his life seeping from him drop by drop , like inner tears . " If only there was some way to avert this , to stop it ! " he exclaimed . " If only I did n't have to face this ! If only I could have it taken away ! " Once again his heart was startled and struck , more deeply this time . It appeared to have a sound , reverberating , so that it filled his body as if a strong voice had spoken . And then , without any reason at all , he saw the picture of the garden he had seen as a child , a colored picture of dark cypresses against a half-hidden moon , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrapped in cloaks . And someone near the stone  --  kneeling ? His mind became confused . " If only I did n't have to die just now , " he muttered . " If only this  --  cup  --  could  --  be  --  taken  --  from  --  my  --  lips . " He stood very still , yet rigid , trying to remember . His struggle was so intense , so concentrated , that he burst into sweat , and he felt an unendurable anguish and sorrow and fear . " I 'm afraid , " he whispered to the curtain . " I 'm only a man , and I 'm afraid . Not the actual death , but the pain of it , and the last agony . Because after that --  Do you understand how it is to feel this way , this fear , this rejection of death , this hope of life , when you know you must die ? But no , how could you know that , unless you have experienced it yourself ? " He had no desire to approach the curtains again or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his hand was reaching forward . The CondemnedThe curtains swung aside at once , and the light gushed out . Eugene fell back rapidly and looked . And looked again . And could not stop looking . Then he sighed , and there was no more pain in him , no fear , no terror , no anger , no despair . Only peace and a sense of releasing grief . " Yes , yes , of course , " he said in a low voice . " You do know how it is , the rejection of death , the hope that you will not have to accept it  --  and the sentence of death . The loneliness of it , the horror of it . " Yes , of course . Now I remember the whole picture of the garden , and you were kneeling , and your companions , the ones you hoped would pray with you , slept . They , in a way , were hiding from your death , as we all hide from each other 's deaths . Denying it , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't thought of you since I was a child , not honestly or deeply thought of you . There was too much work to do . Work .

Only enough to know why we were born , what we must do here , and prepare for our leaving . I 'd forgotten that . In a welter of work that prevented me from knowing what is of the only enduring value in the world-what a waste of time ! How I wasted my time ! " I know you hear me and that you brought me here . Give me a little more time , three or four weeks . So I can tell my children what I really know now , so I can comfort my wife and assure her of the real truth  --  that there is no death . " 136 137The ListenerHe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , and he smiled . " The truth , the one great truth we have  --  that there is no death . " He had made a few spontaneous gestures in his life . He hesitated , then he bent awkwardly and kissed the man 's feet . " I have all the time there is , " he said . " I have eternity .

Giuseppe Pirotti entered the sitting room with the shy yet brisk air of one who is well known , half wishes not to be recognized and half desires to be so , affronted if not , yet relieved .

They had come to America not to " seek their fortunes , " for Giuseppe could have remained at the Excelsior in Rome at a tremendous salary , but simply out of an ardor for adventure . They had settled in this large city , where there were cousins with big families and aunts and uncles and nieces and nephews . They had been successful from the start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be accepted less than forty-eight hours before the scheduled party , and sometimes patrons had to wait a week during holidays . Their Italian and French wine cellars were famous . If Giuseppe was not there , Agnes was sure to be found , and during most of the time they were both present . They supervised everything meticulously . Their kitchens had been photographed many times for national magazines . " Dinner at Giuseppe 's " was an event . Everything was cooked to order , nothing served hastily . " If you can not spend two hours at least with us , " was politely printed on the top of their menus , " we can not serve you well . " There had been always one table left vacant , however , for any priests who might come in . And that , thought Agnes Pirotti with bitterness , had probably been the cause of all this terrible trouble . Oh , little Joe ! There was no waiting table for priests any longer at " Dinner at Giuseppe 's . " A loving and obedient wife , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband , and she had won . The priests understood , delicately ; they did not go to the restaurant any more . Agnes would make it too uncomfortable for them . No one recognized her in the sitting room . But then , these were all strangers , either from out of town or people who could not have afforded her restaurant , where the cheapest dish was four dollars , and A la carte , at that . She sat down defiantly . She wondered if she was committing a sin , then tossed her pretty head . It would be a long , long time ! Yes indeed , a long , long time . She had been born of a busy family , of an industrious people . She carried knitting with her . She opened her large bag and brought out a half-finished sweater of the finest black wool . She looked at it , and then her eyes were full of tears . She tightened her lips and thrust the work back into her bag and scowled before her , trying to control the shaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by one the people about her rose silently as a chime summoned them , and she watched them go . She was the last ; she looked at her diamond watch . She must be back at the restaurant in less than two hours . She twitched impatiently . Then the chimes sounded for her . She rose , made her short body as tall as possible , and marched into the white marble room , with the light flowing down gently upon her . Well , anyway , it was n't a church . She sat down decisively in the chair and contemplated the curtains . Who was behind them ? No one knew . A priest ? She hoped so ! She would143The Listenernever be finished with giving priests a piece of her mind . She said coldly , " Are you a priest ? " She waited . She said , " Then I do n't think I should be here . I 'm all through with priests , Father . I want to make that clear . " She had a rich , womanly voice with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ languages in Italy in a convent school , and she spoke English precisely . " I 'm Mrs. Giuseppe Pirotti , " she continued . " We own the best restaurant in town . " She paused . " And if you 're a priest , which I suppose you are , then you know all about it ! We used to have a table always waiting for any of you . But not now ! I do n't want your company or your patronage  --  not that we ever charged priests , not even the bishop himself . And I ca n't help it if Giuseppe is miserable about it . I 'm not ! " Tears ran into her eyes again , but she held up her head very high and set her mouth firmly . " Giuseppe and I were married when he was twenty-two and I was seventeen . I suppose if you are an American priest you do n't know much about how we Italians feel about children . One time I heard that Italy was a paradise for children , Paris a paradise for women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America 's a paradise for movie actresses and baseball players , and that 's all . " Oh , they make a big fuss about children in America ! I 'm an American citizen , by the way , so I can criticize . Everything 's for the children in America ! The best school palaces , recreation , parks , milk , vitamins , amusements , 144The Anointedclothes . You ca n't pick up a magazine or a book or a newspaperthat does n't have an article or story about children . The big boys and girls , the ones they call teen-agers , rule the country . No wonder it 's full of disobedient , untrained young people who are just bored to death . Yes , they are bored to death . They have security , ' and so there 's no adventure , no danger , no excitement for them , nothing unknown . No wonder they 're always getting into trouble and marrying very , very young and getting divorces ! Why , even when they 're eighteen they think of themselves as children and have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're bored in their sanitary nurseries with all the parents and teachers and doctors fluttering around them like hens over giant chicks . " Do you know something I found out recently ? A very fine family , with only one child , a girl of thirteen , comes in every Saturday night for dinner . A pretty girl , that Margaret . Her age is young , but not the size ! She stands five foot nine in her expensive ballet slippers , and she 's fat , too . Blubbery , baby fat , and she thirteen ! We like the parents , and we thought we 'd lost them as customers  --  they give big parties on the holidays in our private dining rooms  --  when we told them firmly that we could not serve Margaret wine . It 's the law , you know , though much younger children drink wine regularly in Italy , and it never did them any harm . I never did think much of this milk fad , you see . " I said to the parents , We 'd lose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't give Margaret any of yours . It 's the law . ' And the girl frowned at me angrily and said , 145The Listener The AnointedWe kids are the law , and nobody else . ' I thought she was joking , and then I looked at her parents and they had almost crossed themselves ! Honestly ! They looked at that big , overgrown girl as if she 'd just begun to pray the Rosary ! " Agnes snorted with deep contempt . " That was n't the worst . I wanted to soothe that discontented , impudent kid . I said , My , you 're growing up , Margaret ! You are almost a young lady . You 'll be thinking of getting married in five or six years . ' " Now what was wrong with that ? Nothing ! But if I 'd hit the girl or kicked her , she could n't have looked more horrified and disbelieving ! I 'm not joking . She stared at me as if I were out of my mind . Then she shouted : That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child ! Everybody knows that the world is full of big people and little people . I 'm always going to be one of the little people ! I 'm never going to grow up ! What a lie ! ' " Now , " said Agnes , her color high and indignant , " if the girl was stupid or one of those poor , retarded kids , I 'd have understood . But she 's a bright girl and gets honors in school . I could n't believe my own ears . I looked at her parents , and her mother hurries to put her arm about the girl  --  the girl was actually terrified !  --  and said , Why , of course , darling , you 'll always be a little girl , our own little girl . ' And she glared at me and said , How could you hurt a little child like that , Agnes ? You can injure her psyche that way . ' " Well , Father , I do have a temper . I looked at that big girl who actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , and believed it , and at her silly mother and father , 146and I said , very snappishly , Mrs. Knott , I do n't know about that girl 's " psyche , " but if anyone is injuring it , you are ! She is n't a child any more ; she is n't a little girl . It 's time she knew that . ' And I marched away , trying to keep down my burning , and I hoped they 'd never come back . I could n't stand seeing a young person being treated like that , to the detriment of her immortal soul . I had to take a dose of bakingsoda for my heartburn . " Agnes flounced in the chair . " I 've discovered something . All this fuss and care and whimpering and fluttering around children means only one thing : American parents do n't like their children . Perhaps they even hate them . Is n't that terrible ? They hate their children ! If they loved them they 'd think of the children as just part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they 'd love them easily and without all that strain and anxiety , and they 'd know , without anyone teaching them or warning ' them in books and newspapers , how to treat children with justice . They would n't have to read books or spend time at lectures ! They 'd just be natural , and strict , and enforce discipline , and make the kids go to church whether they wanted to or not , and they 'd have prayers every night and give the kids work to do at home after school . Love means teaching responsibilitytoward others , and reverence , and duty to God , and love for God , and love for the family , and respect for parents . If the kids have all that , they do n't need big allowancesand what they call fun , ' and fancy clothes , and dances . That all means nothing . But if they have love , real love , then they have everything else that means something . " 147The Listener I The Anointedstand for any nonsense and tantrums . So he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe . " When an Italian boy is confirmed , he knows he 's a man now , not a little child . It is n't any shock to him , Father . He 's been taught to become a man almost from the day he was born . That 's how it was with our little Joe . " She took out her handkerchief hastily and dried the sud- den flood from her eyes . " Every Italian man and woman wants a big family of children . What else is there in life but God and a loving family ? And aunts and cousins and nephews and nieces and grandmothers and grandfathers ? If we have trouble , all of us are there , helping . It 's not only our duty ; it is joy for us . " But Giuseppe and I  --  we had no children . We waited year after year . We went to shrines and doctors . We wore medals .

I began to think that perhaps I had offended God in some terrible way . We would sit in our nice big house , Giuseppe and I , and cry our hearts out . The doctors were n't sure why there were no children ; some said it was Giuseppe 's physical fault or mine . I had two operations . But no children . We had built a big house , six bedrooms , all empty and silent  --  waiting for children . " And then , when we had given up hope and I was thirty- six and Giuseppe was forty-one , little Joe was born ! " Her face became radiant , full of smiles and tears . She moved forward in the chair , clasping her hands. 149Agnes shook her head dolorously . " I do n't know why I 'm talking like this . I think I wanted to bring out the fact that Americans do n't really love their children and so they try to make up for their guilt in other ways . You have only to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and see how bored to death they are , to know that their parents do n't love them in the right way . How often do you see an American child who looks happy ? I mean really happy and enjoying life ? And I do n't mean looking greedy and excited and staring after new things and running , running , running . What are the poor kids running from ? I think their parents , with their cluckings , and their teachers . I do n't blame them for running . But they have no place to run to that is n't filled with adults waiting to pamper and give them what they call care . ' They want to grow up in an interesting world , and they 're kept babies , with a milk bottle in their mouths . And no interest for them anywhere , only a society that is all nicely organized and has a downy niche ready for them to cuddle down into . Is that all that a soul is born for ? " Agnes smoothed the sleeve of her coat abstractedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grown up , they just want a downy nest , always under wings , out of cold , heavy weather .

He knows his parents love him but that they 're not going to148The Listener " A big , pretty boy , as fat as butter and full of dimples . Why , he smiled before he was a month old ! We almost went out of our minds with joy . The doctor said it was a miracle , It was . We were building a new church , and Giuseppe gave all its stained-glass windows , because we were so grateful . " We brought up Joe just as we 'd been brought up in the old country . All the love in our hearts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of that . He was a lovely boy from the very beginning , gentle , full of fun , kind , sweet , strong . But serious ! Sometimes too serious . We would play with him . But when he was about twelve we found out he was playing with us just to please us ! He did n't want to play any more . He was always studying . We sent him to the best schools , and he studied and studied . " We began to dream of the day when little Joe would be married . He was fifteen then , and after school he would come into the restaurant to help us . Of course that was only right  --  a boy or girl should help parents from the very be- ginning . We began to look over our friends . Who had the prettiest , sweetest , most obedient and industrious girl ? The nicest girl ? Giuseppe and I would talk alone in the kitchen long after all our guests had gone and discuss each girl in turn as Joe became sixteen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandchildren ; at least eight of them , all like Joe . " We had only Joe , but we 'd have a lot of grandchildren , and we 'd be a real family at last . We could hold up our heads with the best of them . We 'd fill up all the rooms in our house . Joe would follow his father or , if he wanted to , he 150 The Anointedcould take up any kind of work . It did n't matter . But he and and his wife would live with us , and there would be all those lovely , laughing , shouting , loving grandchildren . " We should have known ! " said Agnes with anguished bitterness . " We should have known when we saw Joe paying particular attention to the priests at the table we used to keep for them . We thought he was just being respectful and kind , as we 'd taught him , and having reverence for the priesthood . He 'd sit down with the priests , talking , their heads bent together . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honor for priests to be especially interested in your children . When the priests would leave they 'd say to us , You have a wonderful boy there , Agnes and Giuseppe . A noble soul . ' As if we did n't know it ! But we did n't know then what the priests meant ! " I did notice , though , that Joe would be more quiet than usual after he had talked with the priests . And I did n't know that before he came home from school he 'd go first to see Father Vincent ; he 's the priest of our parish . If I had known , I 'd have screamed to the heavens and I 'd have told Father Vincent to let my boy alone ! " Joe 's eighteen now . He 'll be graduated from his school in June . Then a month ago he came home with Father Vincent . My lovely boy ! And they told me , very gently , that Joe wants to be a priest ! My son  --  who was to give me grandchildren  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My only child ! Was n't it the duty of the priests to tell Joe that he should forget the priesthood and stay with his parents who need him more ? " 151The Listener The AnointedAgnes sobbed desperately . " Father , in there , please do n't misunderstand me . It is an honor from God if He chooses one of your children to be a priest or a Sister . But  --  one of your children ! Not your only child who was born when you 'd given up hope of having a child . If I had seven or eight children and Joe was only one of them , I 'd say , Thank God that He singled Joe out for this honor , for this very great honor . ' But we have only Joe , who was our hope for grandchildren . The only hope for our old age . We need him more than  --  than --  " She bent her whole body forward and sobbed and could not restrain herself . " My only son , " she wept . " My only son . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He wants to be a mission priest . He wants to go far away and , he says , bring those who know nothing about God to God . Like one of the Apostles . We 'd never see him then , or only once in a while . Our little Joe , our only son . " She moaned over and over . " He has a vocation , they tell me . He wants to go to the seminary in September . When Giuseppe and I heard about it , I collapsed . And Giuseppe gets grayer and grayer every day , but he says , Mama , when God calls , a man can only obey . ' And Joe tries to comfort me . He said to me yesterday , Mama , I know how you feel . But , Mama , would you want me to ignore God when He is calling me ? Mama ? ' I ca n't speak to Joe , Father . I feel my heart is all bleeding ribbons . The world is such a wicked place now . What will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What will the world do to Joe , this world that 's getting darker and more evil every day ? All thosepriests behind the Iron Curtain  --  they kill them , Father ! When will they start killing the clergy all over the world and not just behind the Iron Curtain ? Father , when you read books and magazines , nobody writes about God . Nobody wants God . They want television sets and ranch houses and new automobiles and washing machines , and bigger pay , and bowling alleys and movies and night clubs . They do n't want God , Father . They want what they call security . ' " A mother thinks about these things . When she has an only son . She is his mother ; she bore him and nursed him , and taught him , and loved him . She is afraid of what the world will do to him if he becomes a priest . She knows they will make fun of him and call him a Holy Joe , ' and that no one will really understand him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party  --  I 've seen it myself  --  the people are uncomfortable until he leaves . They do n't want what he has to give ! " She put her hands over her face . " They never did , Father . They never did . And that 's what is so terrible for a mother who has an only son . " But you 're a man . You do n't know what a mother feels . Did your mother ever feel afraid for you ? Are you her only son ? Did she pray for you when you were far away ? Was she frightened that they might kill you ? " Oh , if only I could talk to a mother like myself ! She would understand ! " Agnes got to her feet , blind with her tears . She ran to the curtain and pushed the button . Instantly the curtains blew aside , and the full glory of the152 153 ' 1 ' he Listenerlight shone out on Agnes . She looked and looked , then slowly fell to her knees . " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew what it meant to be a mother like me . With an only son . An only son . She knew what it was to be afraid , did n't she ? She knew what the world was . " But she never tried to stop you , to keep you from going . She knew you had to leave her to go and tell the people about God . But I wonder what she felt in the lonely night when her son was not in her house . " Agnes lifted her hands and clasped them together . " I am going to be like your mother , as much as I can . I am going to say , as we say in the old country , Go with God . ' To little Joe . Because , unless I say that , he loves me so , he wo n't go . " She stood up . She tried to smile through her tears . " And I 'm going to finish that black sweater for him to wear in the seminary .

He was a tall , thin man of considerableelegance and grace of movement , in his middle forties , with brilliant blue eyes , smooth dark hair , and wellbredfeatures . He looked at his watch . It was only half-past four . He had driven five hundred miles today and was proud of it . At this rate he would reach Reno the day after tomorrow  --  andbegin the boring business once again of waiting six weeks for a divorce .

Within three years , how- ever , he had tired of her as he had tired of his other wives . I must have a calamitous propensity for picking out the shaI- lowest women , he would say to himself . What liars women are ! Each one of them  --  Sue , Ellen , Moira  --  gave me the impression that there was something stimulating and alive about them , something exciting , something that would lead somewhere , something of " infinite variety . " Something significant . But always , they merely turned out to be the usual dull and desperately boring woman . " . . . The women come and go , talking of Michelangelo . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He saw the late autumn crowds moving along the street in the usual bright topaz air of autumn . It was a hand- some city , for a huge metropolis , and had , he thought condescendingly , somewhat of the air of New York . It was clean and tall , faintly Southern in atmosphere , though it was not in the South . Perhaps it was the shine in the sky , the way the light fell on sharp slabs of buildings as on colored marble . For a minute or two the city held his interest . And then the interest was gone , not fading away , but suddenly , blackly gone , like a large light blown out in darkness . Follow- ing that oblivion of interest came the familiar nausea in the pit of his stomach , and with it the usual black , empty de- spair , speechless , motionless , sightless . It robbed his whole body of vitality , slackened his muscles , sucked out his life . It was not the active kind of despair that drove a man to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was merely a profound inertia and apathy . Sluggishly , as the light outside failed , he turned his head and looked at his suitcase , its fine smooth leather dimly glimmering in the rapid dusk . He glanced at his watch . Five o'clock . He was very particular about timeaboutthe time . That alone , he would tell his doctors impatiently , was proof that he had control . He always waited until half-past five . He put his watch to his ear ; it was running . But it was running very slowly . That last half hour was inevitably the worst . It was not that he craved the damned stuff ; he hated the taste of it ; he thought those who looked at the whiskey in their glass with beaming approval and anticipation to be liars . Who , honestly , could stand the taste of alcohol and enjoy it ? The acridness of it , the sting of it , the first sickness of the first drink , the first strong metallic finger laid at the root of the tongue ! Who could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but they wanted , as he always wanted , only the effect . If it was taste they wanted , there were better tastes , God knew , even ginger ale or orange juice . They had meager little natures , most people , and so the effect they wanted was meager also . Thank God he had a large appetite for experience of all kind . At least he used to have it . Here it was again ! He stood up and began to walk around the room , prowling . Should he go outside and take a walk and then stop in at some bar ? No , the presence of others wearied , angered , or disgusted him . Anger came , especially . There was always some jovial soul who was ready to speak to a man alone , and so inevitably he would get into some159The Listenerargument with the lout . As few people were intelligent , the lout , without fail , would turn out to be one of those whose interests centered in sports , women , local news and scandal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board . Worse still , if the lout was a stranger in the city , on business , he always had a wallet full of photographs of his retarded-looking children and a wife who was composed solely of teeth , fat legs in toreador pants , and pixie hair . ( Thank God Moira had had the intelligence not to cut her long red hair . She , at least , looked unlike other women in a country , a world , that was becoming to look more and more faceless all the time . ) The lout , after a few drinks , would become maudlin . " Have any children ? " he 'd say . Damn Moira . When had he wanted to leave her , divorce her ? Six months ago . Why ? He could not remember , but it was between one breath and another . He passed by the dresser , stopped . The usual beguiling dinner menu which always tasted exactly like the food in New York , Philadelphia , London , Cincinnati , Brooklyn , Paris , Chicago , Rome ! No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school ? Vichyssoise was a blanched , pasty insult to the palate wherever you ate it . The menu could be in French , or Italian or English or German  --  it never varied . Even cheese , which had once had a sharp and distinctiveflavor in its many varieties , had become bland , with an aftertaste of starch . Bland . The whole world was turning into a whitish , bland featurelessness . He was sick of it . He was sick of all of it . He wished some disaster would come to it , some fiery fury  --  not that he hated the world. 16oThe PhariseeHe was civilized enough to tolerate it . It was only that he wanted some point to it , some excitement , something which would --  What ? He did not know . There was a pamphlet on the dresser , small but of excellentpaper , with a photograph on the cover : " The John Godfrey Memorial Building . " Alexander loved buildings of all kinds .

Whole thing set on a slow rise , surrounded by trees , marble benches , flower beds , winding walks . Too small for a museum , too small for a library or a religious building . What , then ? Listlessly he began to lay it down . What did it matter ? He would never see that building ; he was not concerned with the mystery of it in this anonymous city . He liked the idea of leaving a mystery , however small and worthless , behind him . It had become a kind of fetish with him over the years . " You and your damned chic ! Do you know how boring you are sometimes with your little airs ? " Moira had cried . Had he become fed up with her at that very moment ? He looked at his watch . Twenty after five .

It suddenly became interesting ; why leave this insignificant local mystery behind ? Moira and her " conceits . " Damn Moira . Damn everybody . He opened the pamphlet and sat down , smiling indulgently at both himself and the pamphlet . It would turn out , this building , to be the DAR center or something , or a place for flower arrangements , or a " study group . " He put on his black-rimmed glasses and opened the pamphlet .

Fountains inside , no doubt , and pretty little green arbors , and the stink of hothouse vegetation . Exotic , top-heavy deadly flowers . Soft lighting . Flow demure could even an old man get ? " This building , " the pamphlet informed him , " was built for the reason that Mr. Godfrey believed that few listened these days to anyone . He believed that it was desperately necessary for men to listen to each other , as they had listened to meistersingers , priests , poets , and philosophers inthe past .

Half-past five came , then six . Suddenly he started as church bells began to ring , filling all the mild autumn air and penetrating the room . He looked at his watch . Six o'clock !

" It would take , " the expert had said seriously , " several hydrogen bombs every three years to keep down the engulfing populations . " He had meant it quite seriously . If necessary , nations would have to resort to that . " Splendid , " said Alexander aloud . And saw Moira 's face . He put the whiskey bottle on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He phrased sentences in his mind and smiled . Perhaps this city would become so embarrassed over his broadcast that it would pull the infernal , ridiculous thing down and build in its place a fine apartment house with aluminum and stone balconies . Alexander smiled with pure , delighted hate . He hated everything that was " popular , " best-selling , widely accepted , revealing public vulgarity at its worst . He hated the gross businessman , the brash politician , the inelegant , the openly enjoyed . He hated Hollywood and movies ( except the esoteric little foreign films ) , large restaurants teeming with people and smells , women who were simple and kind and had no finesse  --  American women , for instance  --  and Americanautomobiles , and " the American way of life , " whatever in the name of God that was ! He loved little slim **29;2386;TOOLONG of poetry which few read , except those like himself . He loved Joyce , because only a few understoodhim . He loved " the dance , " provided it was ballet , Russian or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phariseeinterpret ballet very well . ) But , as he was a liberal , he also loved swarming , after-theater , furiously lighted large dens where one could buy a proletarian hamburger ( two dollars ) and a good , rousing glass of beer ( one dollar ) and mingle with " the people . " He loved the people , provided they did not intrude upon him . He could become quite eloquent on the subject of " the people . " Fresh , earthy , Gothic , he would call them . He never saw " the people . " But , as a liberal , he loved them just the same . " Virtue resides in the people . " The throngs on the streets of New York were not " the people " to him or to his kind . They lived somewhere far in space , or as a symbol . " You are a pretentious mess , " Moira had said to him . " You are as insulated as a baby in an incubator . " Had he begun to despise her then ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mahal . He forgot to open the bottle of whiskey . Smiling happily , he put on his black coat ( London-made ) and his black severe hat ( Londonmade ) . His ridicule of the Taj Mahal would reach the European correspondents , who would then write articles for their foreign newspapers on the " naivete and utter unsophisticationof the American people . " " Mr. Alexander Damon , the Architect , " one London feature writer had written , " is one of the few truly intellectual Americans of today . " Alexander loved to make charming bons mots about Americans , which were widely quoted in Europe , and especially in Russia . Alexander was in almost a happy and exhilarated mood when he took a taxicab to John Godfrey 's little " Parthenon. " 166 ( It had overtones of Zen-Buddhism . ) He regarded taxi drivers as part of " the people . " Witty , wise , illiterate Socrateses . He said , " Have you ever been to John Godfrey 's building ? " " Nope , " said the driver sullenly . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxi drivers were stupid . ) " Do you take many people there ? " The driver was silent . Alexander looked with cool distaste at the interior of the cab . A typical American " job . " He said with his usual sang-froid when he was speaking to a member of " the people , " " Why do n't you fellers insist on the European cars ? Quicker , more agile , and not gas-eaters ? There 's nothing like a foreign car . I have a small Mercedes-Benz , myself . " " You do , huh ? " said the driver . He had a thick neck , and now it became crimson . He did not turn . " Look , mister , I got a son and his family in Detroit . He works in one of them automobile joints , makin ' cars . You 're puttin ' him out of business , you and your foreign cars ! What can they make better'n an American car ? You tell me that ! If people want little cars , we got the tools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You one of them Communists , everythin ' better outside this country than in ? " Alexander was startled . But then , he was in the " hinterland , " where everyone was one hundred per cent American , no matter where one was born . He knew how to handle " the people . " He peered at the driver 's certificate . " Now , Bob , you know that Europe does have some talents we do n't have , do n't you ? " 167The Listener " Sure , I know , " said the driver . " We 're all Europeans here , ai n't we ? Your dad or granddad , or maybe even way back  --  they was Europeans . Think we 're all Indians , eh ? You 're sure mixed up . Mister , you sure are mixed up ! " Alexander did not answer . He felt hot and disgusted . He liked love and humility in " the people , " and an eagerness to learn obediently . And an anxiety to be " led " by their natural rulers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of " the people . " The driver stopped the cab . " One dollar fifty , " he said in a surly voice . " Ca n't drive the car up there . You got ta walk a little . " Alexander got out of the cab . He counted out precisely one dollar and sixty-five cents . The driver looked at the money and snorted . " I shoulda known ! " he said , and drove off . Alexander laughed softly . That idiot was exactly like any New York taxi driver . They wanted nothing but money . That was the grossness of America . He walked up the gently winding red gravel walk ; everything was dimly illuminated . Almost European in its effect ; no glare . No neon signs . He had expected neon , in various flaming colors , going on and off , in big pink and blue and purple letters : " Come ! The Man who Listens ! ! ! " Like a Revivalist temple . It was nothing like that . The small marble building raised itself purely against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' Why , it 's very artistic ! And very emotional , in a restrained and serene sort of way . The gravel under his feet reminded him of Oslo , of Rome , of Stockholm . He nodded approvingly . No smooth168The Phariseeconcrete or asphalt . That would be out of character . He detested things out of character . The men who built this place , laid out these gardens , were very sophisticated and knowing . He could not have designed this better himself . Nor , he thought , could he have imagined anything more restful and beautiful than the waiting room . No money had been spared . Where had that silly old lawyer gotten that money in this city ? And the decorator ? Very restful . No modern furniture , no amoeba-like , free-form glass tables on one or two scattered legs . But I designed an office like that , thought Alexander Damon . It was photographed for a nationalmagazine . It gave me the horrors . In fact , everything gives me the horrors . He sat down in his coat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said aloud . There was no one there but himself . The proletarian dinner hour . There was a chime . " For me ? " he asked courteously . The chime sounded again . He stood up , smiling in anticipation , and went into a stark-white marble room with blue velvet curtains concealingan alcove , and a marble chair . He sat down in the marble chair . He looked at the curtains . There was no sound here , no hurrying , no shrill whisper . No sense of amusement . The white walls were without decoration . They beamed at him , illuminated and waiting . He sat . No one asked him any questions or gave an indication of impatience . He continued to sit and to wait . The room waited with him . ' What had that pamphlet said ? " All the time there is . " X69The Listener " That 's the trouble , " he said to the curtains . " There 's too much time . " He was aghast at this blunder . " I must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'm not here because I have a problem . ' I am here only as an in- vestigator . I wo n't tell you my profession or business . That is immaterial . " ' What was wrong with him ? His profession , immaterial ! He must call his analyst tonight . When a man thought his work was " immaterial " he was out in the deep end . " Are you a psychiatrist ? " he asked contemptuously . " Not that I dislike psychiatrists . We all need help . I have an analyst of my own . If there were more psychiatrists in America we 'd all come to understand ourselves more . Know thyself , ' said Socrates . A very sound idea . My analyst assures me that I know myself completely . But I have the worst possible propensity for selecting wives that are bad for me . He has studied my last wife , Moira , and is convinced , as I am , that she is the most stupid selection of them all . She has no flair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had before we were married . A dull , plodding woman , Moira , though she paints . But every woman , I am sure , is dull and plodding . Their biological necessity , their nest-building . But who would have thought it of Moira , the modernistic painter ? Everyone lives in deception . " There was no sound , no movement , no rustle of traffic . " Every psychiatrist , and I am sure you are no exception , wants to know your background , from birth on , your child- hood traumas , your parents , your siblings . Your teachers . The PhariseeYour playmates . Your relatives . It is only in that way that they can fix the blame where it belongs , for your misery , your meaningless life . " He leaned forward , flushing . " I 'm sorry . That was a slip of my tongue . My life has meaning . The only trouble is that there is no meaning in others . They exist only as impediments , slowing up your flow of ideas , your enthusiasm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when that happens there is nothing left , no life , no drama , no significance , no zest , no meaningfulend , nothing to strive for , to hope for , to work for . No color , no vitality , no excitement , no passion , no drive  --  no goal : We kill each other , not with an honest knife or a blow , but through our inertia . That is the real murder . I 've been murdered , from my childhood on . By pointless people , by conformists , by repetition . Always repetition . " He smiled slightly at the curtains . " I have read your pamphlet . If one does n't wish to see the face of the psychiatristwho listens , one does n't need to press the button . I have no intention of pressing it . I prefer that you hear me in silence and in anonymity . " He said , " I wish to be perfectly candid . I 'm here to expose this silly nonsense . I was always an honest person . I intend to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain television program called Visit Him Now . ' Very poignant , is n't it ? Visit Him Now . ' No doubt you are familiar with the program .

I was under the170 II 171The Listenerimpression that the public prefers Western shooting and gangsters and what they call situation home dramas . ' But Mr. Brewster  --  Gene , we call him  --  is very popular , even if he has a late broadcasting . Every intelligent person listens to him . Of course the yuks are in bed at that time . " Alexander waited . He looked coldly at the curtains . " Of course you have seen his programs ? " Why this damned , white , marble silence ? Oh , the Man who Listens . " I 'm a listener , myself , " said Alexander . " In fact , it seems to me that I 've been listening  --  too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate , I am going to expose this sentimental slop on that program . I hope you do n't mind . After all , when your identity is known you 'll have more publicity than you ever had before ! Is that your object ? " He shrugged . " Everything is Madison Avenue , " he said . " Look , I 'm not condemning you . We all live by advertisement , do n't we ? And I must say that the way you advertise  --  discreet and artistic  --  is very well done . I could n't do better , myself . Of course you know the origin of the word ' broadcasting . ' It was done by the Romans , and the Greeks before them , and the Egyptians . Public letters .

It did n't really matter that the daggers could beThe Phariseebought for five hundred a sesterce . Very cheap metal ; of no value . But interesting . Very interesting . But even politicians in these days are dull . No bright ideas . They must hire people to give them ideas , who will then broadcast them in the names of the politicians . That is public relations . " He paused . He felt a hungry , sick crawling along his nerves , a desperate aching . " It is not , " he said , " that I am an alcoholic . My analyst assured me I am not . It is only that I ca n't stand --  " He stopped . Then he exclaimed , " I ca n't stand living ! " He rubbed the palms of his hands together , over and over , in the immemorial gesture of despair , and did not know it . " What an idiotic thing to say , " he murmured apologetically . " I never blurted out that to my analyst ! I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd have recommended shock treatment at once . Manic depression . I 'm not in the least depressive . ' You can take the word of one of your colleaguesabout that ! I am not even manic-depressive-manic . I 'm quite normal . If I sometimes drink to excess , who can blame me ? No one . " He stood up restlessly . " I 'm afraid I 'm taking up too much of your time . After all , you do n't find many people like myself , do you , in this city ? Still , it may be interesting to you to listen to someone who does n't have bunions , or constipation , or bewildering teen-age children , or a quarrel with a husband or wife  --  ordinary , foolish problems . One of my friends , who is an advertising manager , told me that the problems ' of the stupid were big business in America . They created wants and needs and demands . ' To satisfy the173The Listener problems . ' In other words , give a man whose soul is aching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Suck like a baby , and smile and gurgle , and then there are no more problems . The soul does n't ache any more . It settles down to enjoy the momentary syrup . I 'm sure you under- stand that I 'm speaking of the soul in a loose sense  --  the psyche . An aching soul . " He had a sudden intense sensation that someone had moved closer to him and was listening acutely . He shrugged , smiled about the room . He sat down again . " Do you know what happens to me when I drink too much , as I usually do ? You see , I 'm being candid , and no alcoholic is candid . When I was in preparatory school we studied Swinburne , that Victorian , gloomy , unsophisticated poet . I remember his Garden of Proserpine  --  when I 'm drink- ing . Only one stanza , I 'm pleased to say . May I repeat it ? " I am tired of tears and laughter , Of men that laugh and weep ; Of what may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am weary of days and hours , Blown buds of barren flowers , Desires and dreams and powers And everything but sleep . " I drink , " said Alexander Damon , " for sleep . Only for sleep . To forget . " He settled deeply in the chair . He was exhausted , yet he felt released . He said , " Blown buds of barren flowers . ' All 174 The Phariseemy life was barren . And pointless . And without meaning . " He looked at the curtains again . " I am not whimpering . Everybody 's life is like that . Nobody 's life ever was fruitful . Not even Christ 's . His was the most fruitless of all . Do n't you agree ? Two thousand years ! And there are no real Christians . When you come down to it , there are no religious people anywhere , are there ? Can you imagine them in public relations , or business , or anywhere else , for that matter ? The very idea is calamitous . I met a Jewish writer the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he called himself . He was actually writing a book about his God . ' I told him he 'd never get a publisher for such a naive idea . He said , I certainly will . We need a new affirmation , every generation , of the presence of God in our lives . ' Everyone at the table laughed . I 'm afraid that I laughed the hardest of all . Moira  --  she is my present wife  --  was very indignant . She told me I 'd been drinking too much . But all my wives have said that , though they understood I am not an alcoholic . They make , as the proletariat say , a federal case of it . " The wild hunger moved through every organ of his body , demanding , screaming . He moistened his lips . He would leave almost immediately . It was late , very late . But he could begin his slow , steadfast drinking as soon as he got back to his hotel . Be quiet , he told his urgent body . His thirsty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was always waiting for something . The white light and the silent walls waited . " My father , " said Alexander Damon , quietly mopping his face and hands , " was a very successful lawyer in New York. 175The ListenerUnfortunately , he died when I was only fourteen . I missed a father 's influence . My mother was one of those Victorian ladies with a high sense of rectitude and duty and responsibility . The minister was always at our house . My father used to make fun of him when he left , he was such a simple soul , very naive and earnestly full of faith . Louise , ' Father would say to my mother , how can you endure that droning nonsense ? After all , you are an intelligent person for a woman . We are n't living in the Dark Ages any longer , you know . ' But my mother would say , Do n't be silly , Edgar . If you 'd listen to Mr. Thayer you 'd find some direction , some purpose , some meaning in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' I remember my father laughing . He was a very distinguished man , really , and civilized and adult . He would kiss my mother and say , You 're my meaning in life . ' She 'd become very disagreeable to him then and push him away and warn him , Alex is listening . I do n't want him to be as frivolous as you . ' " You can see now what a wretched influence my mother had on my life . If she 'd let us alone  --  my father and me  --  we 'd have come to understand each other , I suppose . Not that he was particularly interested in me ; he was interested in enjoying himself and being successful , and we had what they called fine wine cellars ' in those days . " But I 've gone over all this with my analyst ; I could repeatthe whole story by heart . Which I am doing , I am afraid . When my father died --  I forgot to tell you  --  he killed himself . He hung himself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his library one night . One of the servants found him the next morning . " Alexander was sweating profusely . He took off his coat ; it seemed to hamper him and grasp him , like clutching arms . He tore it from his body and threw it from him . " My analyst , " he said in a faint , weakened voice , " told me that he suspected that it was my mother 's frigidity that drove my father to his death . I do n't quite believe that . We found out later that he had quite a number of women who were consoling him . But of course he had no consolation at home , where everything was geared to finding out why you were born , what you were to do here , and to prepare for what , as our minister said , was our life hereafter . ' In that gloomy atmosphere  --  can you blame my father for killing himself ? " He waited for an answer . But none came . He looked at the walls . They had an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head impatiently . " I 'm sorry that I said gloomy atmosphere . ' It was n't really . My mother was an amusing and pretty woman . She had a peaceful air about her ; she was very popular in New York . Strange that I should have given you the wrong impression that she was a severe and stern sort of woman . She was n't . She just seemed to have a meaning in her life . In all justice  --  I must remember to make a note of that when I next talk to my analyst  --  I 'm afraid I misled him . I told him that my mother was a sort of tall Queen Mary , all propriety and uprightness . At least I think I told him that . But no , now that I think of it , he suggested it himself ! Apparently he has177The Listener The Phariseenumbered slots where he inserts people with a click . I let him do that about my mother . What did it matter , anyway ? It may have been misleading  --  I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not my mother 's . It is easier sometimes to let people think that what they believe is the truth . " My mother died shortly after I was graduated . She had been sick for some time , though I never heard her complain . Just before she died she said to me , Alex , there is a meaning why you were born . You must try to find it , not just in your work , but in yourself . Your father never found that meaning , God help him . ' " I had never forgiven her for my father 's death . I think perhaps that I never forgave him , either ! He loved no one except my mother . Of course he was interested in me , but my mother was first . He was a man of wide interests . When you consider my mother , who , though popular and pretty and home-loving and devoted  --  she wanted several children  --  was a somewhat shallow woman , it would make anyone wonder why my father thought she was earth and high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself . " Alexander Damon stood up . " I know why he killed himself . He found no meaning in life . None at all . And neither do I. " He rubbed his hands over and over . " What meaning is there , for anyone ? " Let me tell you about my stupid wives , who all resembled my mother in one way or another . ( My analyst has been very interested in that . ) At first they seemed sparkling and interesting to me . They offered a sense of excitement , of some-178thing about to happen . But invariably , after a few years , they became dull to me , and pointless . " Perhaps it was my work , too , that accentuated it all . I 'd see my finished  --  structure  --  and feel flat and empty as death . Then another would begin . All those buildings . Repetition . Everything was repetition until I 'd feel myself going mad inside . Once , when I was younger , I thought that hell must be like that . Repetition . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . Repetition . If the repetition had had any meaningfulness , I 'd have been contented . But it did n't . For what is a man born ? To throw up more and more buildings , more and more offices , more and more apartment houses ? For what ? Tell me , in God 's name , for what ? " He began to pace with agitation up and down the room . " Like bees . Like ants . Surely a man is more than a bee or an ant ! Is n't he ? Surely what he does will make a mark on the world ? But only six years ago I saw one of New York 's most famous and beautiful buildings torn down  --  to make room for one of my icy glass-and-aluminum structures .

Why bring them into this horror of realization that179The Listener The Phariseeyou have no meaning in your life , that the world has no meaning , that all is repetition , a treadmill , a squirrel cage ? No matter what you do ! Nothing has any lasting meaning , significance , worth . " He stopped and looked at the curtains and did not know that he was crying . " Can you understand that ? Can you live with that , knowing that you were born for nothing , live for nothing , die for nothing ? Why not put an end to it , as my father did , or forget your meaninglessness in drinking ? " You listen to the noise of the world , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slamming of doors , and you watch the people coming and going , as if what they did was relevant . Then it all takes on a quality of nightmare , of hell . There 's no escape , except in drinking . I can understand why people take drugs too . It 's the despair of the thing , the hopelessness . Oh , it 's all right when you are young ! You are full of ginger ; you are going to accomplish something . Accomplish what ? When you become successful you 've reached the end of the road . After that  --  you only repeatyourself . " I 've tried to tell Moira that . ( She resembles my mother even more than my first wives did . ) And she says , Why , you work , of course , not just for your own fulfillment . You work for God . You put God in your work ; you try to help Him find the pattern in what you do and what He wants you to do , even if it is only raising potatoes or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You can see how utterly absurd she is .

' " Alexander moved closer to the curtain , almost within touching distance . " And now you see why I must divorce Moira , too , and why I drink . " Oh , God ! What meaning is there in life ?

Repetition . Endless years of it . Repetition . But eventually  --  yes , I suppose so . What you do does have meaning . " He sat down in the marble chair , his elbow on the arm , his chin in his hand . He was no longer exhausted and driven , or hungry or desperate , or full of craving . He continued to contemplate the man before him , his face moved and listening. 18o 181The Listener The Pharisee " Yes , " he said . " I do see what you mean .

But even if you suffer anything for justice ' sake , blessed are you . So have no fear of their fear , and do not be troubled . I Peter 3:13  --  14SOUL ELEVENThe man who sat in the white room with its blue curtains and marble chair was young , but he appeared old , for his color was grayish and weary , his features pinched , his eyes wizened in his tired face . He had a long thin nose with a sharp point , an intelligent and sensitive expression , though it was bitter now , and an intense and embittered mouth . Everything about him was neat and brushed and careful , even if his clothing was cheap , even if his shoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands were carefully kept , and they moved restlessly on the arms of the chair . He looked at the curtains somberly . " I am not going to give you my name , " he said . " After all , I need my salary and I do n't want whispers to travel back to the school board about my complaints . ' Oh yes , I 'm a teacher . A teacher must never complain ; he must always be dedicated to the children ' and his sacred calling . ' Yes , I heard the president of the PTA189The Listenersay it was that  --  a sacred ' calling . She was wearing a spring hat that cost , at the very least , half of my month 's salary . She beamed at us , all radiance and pink dimples , and congratulatedus on having been called . ' We smiled back at her in a sickly way ; her husband 's income , per month , is more than any of our yearly salaries . I wonder what she is dedicated ' to and what her calling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three staring and impudent children , each a separate curse to his teachers , she has done the noblest thing of all and we should be happy to give our lives to her offspring . " She was very eloquent , and she made little ballet gestures with her hands and rolled her eyes , and her voice became lyrical . A teacher , ' she warbled  --  how I hate these warbling , professional mothers !  --  cares nothing for money , and is n't that wonderful in a materialistic age ? ' He or she has given his or her life to the holy children . ' I looked at Marcia , sitting opposite me , and thought of her salary and her invalidmother and how I had just co-signed a loan for her so she could pay the doctor 's bills . Marcia , who , like myself , must find another job in the summer , instead of studying or resting and refreshing herself on a little holiday so that she could be not only a strong teacher in September but a full human being . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't full human beings . We were never pennitted to be . ' Dedicated . ' Why does everybody believe that a teacher should have no life of his own , no pleasure , no joy , no money , no laughter , and occasionally no innocent sin ? Who are they , these professional mothers and fatuous fathers , to believe190The Teacherthat their children are worth our death in life ? Or anyone 's life , if it comes to that ? Or even their own ? The majority of people only take up room in the world , without contributinga thing to it but endless replicas of themselves who must be ' educated . ' " The room was very quiet , very still . The man sighed , looked about him . " You do n't know , " he said , " how wonderfulit is to be in a place that is as silent and peaceful as this ! No children , no school board , no principals , no PTA , no shrill voices and pounding feet , no worry , no anxiety . Above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently I overheard a man say to another , It 's very funny , but the teachers are always complaining about their low salaries . But I 've noticed they leave very fat estates , most of them . Did you see where old Miss Thompson died the other day ? She was all of eighty . She left nearly two hundredthousand dollars . Not bad . Not bad at all . ' " I wanted to tell the fool , " said the teacher , his voice rising , " that old Miss Thompson had been able to save a large part of her salary before high taxes came on the scene . And in an age when a schoolteacher 's salary was substantial compared with an unskilled laborer 's and prices were low . Moreover , many teachers had been left respectable estates by parents . Moreover , many of them remained unmarried and had small expenses . Unmarried . Now we must remain unmarried because we ca n't afford to marry ! Marcia  --  " His features drew together in a spasm . " The only time we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  all glass and landscaping and fine hot and191The Listenercold running swimming pools and pretty furniture and colored walls and lavish gyms and auditoriums that resemble expensive theaters . Then we go home to our drab rooms and look at the old furniture handed down to us by our mothers , or at the miserable sticks of a furnished , cheap apartment . Yet we teachers are the ones who are scolded in the press and at public meetings for palatial schools ' and high budgets ' and extravagance ! This always happens when we timidly ask for a raise in salary so we can live too . We are blamed for the high estimates of new schools or expansions of old ones . " None of the scolders , of course , ever blames himself for the gigantic and luxurious school plants . They want the very best , and the most expensive and luxurious , for the children . ' They demand these things ; the children deserve ' them . I should like to know what law , spiritual or national , declares that people deserve ' anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a child that you must justify your existence in this world . I 've had kids whimper in my class that they did n't ask to be born . ' Well , neither did I , and neither did my parents , or their parents before them , or anyone else in the world ! But once here we have duties before rights , and responsibilities before demands . ' Try to tell that to your class ! The principal will ask for your suspension or resignation at once . The professional mothers will be all shrieking mouths and baleful eyes and angry gestures . " The teacher sighed , a faint sigh that spoke of exhaustion and hopelessness . " The kids do n't need luxurious school palaces . MyThe Teachergeneration did n't . They need only sound buildings ; no luxuries . They do n't need supervised ' play . Why ca n't people let kids alone ? They 've become projects ' now , of idle mothers who in other generations were too busy caring for their homes and cooking and baking and washing and sewingand scrubbing floors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so dangerous to a whole nation than a tribe of idle women busying themselves with projects ' of one sort or another . I 'd like to hang the men who invented automatic washing machines and other gadgets ! Now the majority of people do n't have homes ; they have housing ' for electrical equipment which gives them more time  --  more time for what ? Mischief . No wonder we have the problem of juvenile delinquency . " The teacher rubbed his lined forehead . " I could talk all day about this , " he said apologetically . " The teacher 's problemsare the problems of a whole nation . I do want to thank you for listening to me . People never listen to a teacher . They think we 're prosy , proper , and stiff , almost as bad as the clergy . They 've forced that archetype on us . We 're flesh and blood ; we hate the pattern they demand we fit . " I was speaking to you about the school palaces . A school is a place of learning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of baby-sitters . A school is an institution where children should be taught as widely as possible , and drilled and disciplined , and informed about their present and future public duties , to their family , their Creator , and their nation . I could spend another full day telling you of the silly and embarrassing courses ' which are now part of the schoolThe Listenercurriculum , which were demanded by parents and not by teachers . Each facet of a teacher 's life would fill a whole book ! And each facet is expensive , and the taxpayers scream  --  yet it is the taxpayers who demand all this nonsense and all this lavishness . When they look at their tax bills , they next look at the salaries teachers receive and talk about five hours ' work a day and holidays ' and long summer vacations ' and why are teachers so greedy ? Why do they want more money ? Where is the old-fashioned teacher who was ' dedicated ' and never thought about money at all ? " Yes , where is the old-fashioned teacher who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with even more respect by his students ' parents ? What happened to an age when children understood they came to school to learn , to be grateful for the chance to learn , and to listen with eager interest ? What happened to an age when parents kept their hands off the schools and attended to their own business  --  which was earning a living by sound labor and caring for their families and taking them to church ? I think I have at least one answer to that : too many people have too much money , too much time , too much fun . ' " He sighed again . " If all this money , leisure , and fun had resulted in a spiritually stronger people , a nobler people , a people with higher principles and strength of character , a more free and intelligent people , a more responsible people , a people more aware of what there is to learn in the world , a people who desired more libraries and a continuing educationafter they had long left school , it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salaries paid school-194The Teacherteachers ; we 'd be happy , have a high feeling of self-esteem and satisfaction ; we 'd know we had accomplished somethingworthwhile . We 'd feel , then , that our demanded dedication ' was dedication indeed , given with all our hearts and all our souls . If a man has any rights at all , it is the right of pride in his occupation . " But all the money and leisure and fun have been disastrousto us as a nation . They 've sent us searching , not for learning and wisdom , but for trivialities , newer amusements , newer mischief , cheaper and more vulgar entertainment , more ornate cars , more toys to fill idle , restless hands . Where is the American character now , the character that opened frontiers in the wilderness , that sailed on dark seas , that established free schools and churches , that voted for men of integrity and not men with four-cornered smiles full ofglaring teeth , that considered morality the very foundation j of a people and God its keystone ? Where are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understanding ? They are a dead race . They 're laughed at in books and articles as Victorians ' and puritans . ' You see , they never had much money and they knew nothing of jet planes and fun . They only knew how to build a nation , free under God , and how to form a Constitution that is the noblest documentever written by man  --  under God . " 1The teacher rested his worn cheek on his palm . " Because of the kind of people we have now we shall lose that nation , conceived in liberty and faith . Because we teachers are not permitted any longer to teach the children what they should be taught , they 'll become increasingly weak , undisciplined , 195The Listenerfierce , bored , unprincipled and dutiless  --  and uneducated . The children are n't more stupid than their grandparents , even if some teachers bitterly say they are . It is only that they are ignorant , and are kept ignorant , by the insistence of their parents that their brains not be taxed in schools , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the classroomand not taught , that school be only a glorified , warm , luxurious play pen . While Mama busies herself about her projects ' and bridge games . " Mama loves the word trauma . ' She 's picked up a great deal of psychiatric jargon in her careless reading . I wonder if she ever thinks of the incurable trauma ' she is inflicting on her children by making life too pleasant and comfortable for them ? I wonder if she ever thinks of the trauma ' she inflicts on the teachers of her children by denying them the right of pride in their occupation and a decent recompense as some of the more important people in her children 's lives ? " She 's taken our ancient pride from us , the pride of Socrates and Plato and Aristotle , and the whole grandeur of the teaching profession , from the very beginning when teachers were also priests and philosophers . To Mama , we are baby-sitters , paid to amuse her children and care ' for them . If she despises what she has made of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ourselves for letting her do this to our spirits ? " The teacher looked with haggard eyes at the curtain . Hislips were dry . He moistened them . He leaned forward a little . " Were you ever a teacher ? " he asked , coughing apologetically , then hating himself for that apologetic cough which196The Teacherwas now part of a teacher 's mannerisms . He waited . The light in the room seemed warmer , gentler , like an assent . " Oh ? " he murmured . " Then you were , or are , a teacher ! Then you know . " For a moment he was apprehensive . " I wonder if you can see through those curtains . I 'd  --  I 'd prefer it if you could not . I would n't want the board --  " I 'm sorry , " said the teacher . There was a dry smarting along his eyelids . " I should n't have said that . " Something tight in him began to relax . He coughed , wiped his lips . He was trembling a little . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much , and in this way , before , except when I 'm with Marcia . You see , Marcia and I want to be married . " He rubbed his dry hands over his dry face . He mumbled , " Even my bones are tired . I go to bed tired and wake up tired . My life is one drab gray tiredness . I ca n't eat without feeling the grit of tiredness in my food . The uselessness --  " He said , " Marcia and I grew up together , and that 's a miracle now , considering what the social scientists call a mobile population . ' Approvingly . As if the mere moving of legs and bodies and cars and trains and planes and buses were a virtue in itself . Mobility is assumed to be dynamism . ' Then the desperate pacing of lions in a zoo is dynamism too . The desperate pacing of creatures who want to be free  --  free of what ? I do n't know ! Perhaps of comfort and leisure and entertainment and fun . ' Perhaps they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they go looking for it restlessly and never find it . They only exchange places and habitations , and they 're all the same . So they move again . Mobile . I 'd prefer to call it desperation. 197The Listener " As a teacher yourself , you 'll understand this . No doubt you encounter it every day . I wonder if I know you . " Again the warm and beaming assent reached out to him with love . He coughed . " Marcia and I went to school together in old Number Ten . We saw each other in class ; we had to run  --  and I do mean run  --  home after school to help our mothers . Marcia had two brothers and one sister . They 're all married now . They have responsibilities ' to their families and so ca n't contribute to their old mother 's support . Marcia , they say resentfully , is n't married , and as a teacher she 'll probably never marry , so it is her responsibility ' to support their mother . It 's very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibility in others  --  especiallyif it involves their wallets . " Marcia was always a gentle , quiet girl and , like myself , she always wanted to be a teacher . We used to talk about it whenever we had a moment to talk , in the hallways , just before the bells rang , at Sunday school . And so we studied very hard . We were , in the true meaning of the word , dedicatedyoung people . We could n't think of anything nobler and finer than taking up where our hard-working and dedicatedteachers had to leave off , in death and old age . We loved and reverenced our teachers . We knew what they were . Why , our teachers were the same kind of people as our pastors ! " We would often talk of Our Lord as The Teacher . When we were at State Teachers College we 'd walk on the campus and discuss Him . We knew that the word rabbi ' meant198The Teacherteacher , and He was called rabbi ' by His disciples . What greater calling , then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ministry ? In fact , teachers were the laymenof Holy Orders . We wore vestments on our spirits . " We did n't think of salaries  --  then . Because we had the pride of our profession , the nobility of it . That was above money . " The teacher laughed gently , sadly . " I am thirty-eight , " he said . " Marcia is thirty-seven . We 've been teaching many years , if you want to call it teaching . ' At first it was exhilarating . It was exciting , satisfying , fulfilling . " Then one day when Marcia was teaching history  --  her subject  --  she happened to mention that if one looked acutely at history one saw the hand of God in the rise and fall of nations . A nation flourished , said Marcia , when it obeyed the immutable Law of God , and it declined when it disobeyed . There was a terrible inevitability in it all . " What happened to Marcia , then , was also terrible . A mob of parents stormed into the school loudly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Church and State . ' Marcia is such a gentle soul . She could only stand in confused silence in the principal 's office while the professionalmothers scolded her . Did n't she know that the Constitution expressly forbids the establishing of a State religion ? Was n't she modern ? Had n't she learned yet that no prayers or mention of God was permitted in the public schools ? Separation of Church and State . ' " Then Marcia said , But God is the State . ' She was suspendedimmediately . The principal was a kindly , religious199The Listenersoul . But there were the parents . And something more sinister behind the parents . ' Why , she and I were taught the Lord 's Prayer in our public schools , and the Ten Commandments , and were told our duty to God . I never heard any Catholic , Protestant , or Jewish mother protest then . It is possible , of course , that parents in our youth were more concerned about the souls of their children than the milk they drank and the hot free lunches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they now call it . ( What is mental health ' but harmony between a man and his God ? ) " Marcia was heartbroken . She is too gentle to fight . She had no money with which to fight . I had five hundred dollars . We brought up the whole matter in court . It was finally decided  --  the judge looked tired and embarrassed , himself  --  that Marcia should be restored to her position but that she must never violate the principle of separation of Church and State ' again . " I 've studied that Amendment to the Constitution . It speaks only of the fact that the government must never set up any particular religion as the State religion , such as they have in Britain and the Scandinavian countries . No particularreligion must be recognized as the one and only religion . " What did Marcia 's speaking of God in history have to do with any established religion ? The Old Testament speaks of God as the foundation of nations . So does the New Testament . A people without a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' from our people , the vision of God in the affairs of men . Who are they ' ? I do n't know . I only know they 're there . I only know that any teacher who men-200The Teachertions God is under danger of discharge . Who are they ' ? " He leaned forward eagerly . " Do n't you think , for our children'ssake , that we should find out and expose them ? Are they politicians ? Evil people ? Stupid people ? I do n't know . " His eagerness expired . " I am only a teacher , God help me . " The light became brighter , closer , as if a colleague had moved nearer to him in sympathy and profound understanding . " Yes , you do understand , " he murmured . After a while he said faintly , " I tried at first . At first there was no pressure on the teachers . We taught our subjects and did the very best we could . If one child suddenly looked at us with bright comprehension and enlightenment and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day with warm satisfaction . My subject , by the way , is mathematics , the Apollonian art . ' Quite often , as I explained and mentioned the art , ' the whole class would come alert . Mathematics was n't something dry and dead . It was n't just an abstraction . It was a great and exciting mystery . The whole universe is governed by the law of mathematics . The children would understand then . Everything , from the feeble movement of an amoeba to the rush of the farthest and most tremendous constellation , was governed by the basic law of mathematics . Without mathematics , the encompassing art and law of mathematics , the universe would become chaos and cease to exist . " I think , " said the teacher , " that one of the most beautiful days of my life was when one of my pupils gave me a poem he 'd written about mathematics . Not a good poem by2orThe Listener poetical standards . But a fervent poem of what mathematics meant to him , not as a future CPA , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said the teacher , " had a pupil like that for the past eight years . And what I must teach now must n't tax the child . ' They come to me , in the junior year at high school , without as much knowledge as we had in the seventh grade of grammar school . They lounge around in their seats , chewing gum , winking at each other , exchanging notes , suddenly laughing boisterously , yawning , dozing , primping , combing their hair , putting on lipstick , chewing candy , sud- denly and senselessly giggling . Four of my girl students , this year alone  --  and they only sixteen  --  have had to leave school for reasons of pregnancy . " Again he scrubbed his face with his dry hands . " Who are these young people ? Who has been destroying them system- atically ? Their parents , their teachers , their schools ? Who has been denying them life and joy and excitement ? I do n't know . I only know I am tired . I am exhausted by trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order in my classes takes up all my time . Not teaching . Just hope- less attempts at control . The lurching youths  --  they lurch out of their seats and start for the door with wild , uncontrolled , and hating faces . I say , Where are you going ? ' And they answer , None of your goddamn business . ' " I complain to the principal . He says , It is the parents ' fault . ' The parents say , It is the teachers ' fault . " The teacher stood up . He cried loudly , " It is the fault of all of us ! This dreadful decay of the human spirit , the human nobility , the human reason ! It is America 's fault , trivial , The Teacherfun-loving , laughing , moneyful , amusement-seeking , circuswanting , demanding , whining , dancing , greedy ! A people without a vision ! A people which must diel " He sat down , as if struck . " Because they have too much money . Because they have no duties , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other people despise us , it is our own fault . We are ancient Rome . " He sat in silence . The light became colder , and there was a question in it . " A big , fat , and profitless people . Wind without rain is profitless . " He looked at his hands clenched together , the fingers whitened by intense pressure . He studied them a long time . " I was afraid , " he whispered . " I was afraid for my job . A few thousand dollars a year . But now I am done with it all . I 've been offered a position in an accountant 's office . Twice as much as I receive now . No children , no ugly , huge , fat children , no screaming shrill parents , no frightened principals , no exigent school boards . No school palaces like hothouses . ' Agood salary , without struggle , without despair . And Marcia and I can be married at last . " He looked at the still curtains , which seemed to wait . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What did you say ? " he said . He looked about him helplessly . " What can I do ? " he muttered . " Teaching is  --  was  --  all my life . But no one wants to be taught . I 'm tired . I 've given up . The fat , rosy , stupid faces ! The big fat legs ! The empty eyes ! The big tooth-filled grinning mouths ! Their huge porcelain teeth : they are more202 203The Listenerimportant to them than knowledge , than their immortal souls . I 'm not my students ' guide any longer ; they drag me along in their senseless lurching as a man is dragged along by an elephant . " The light became colder , fainter . " When did I begin to give up ? " he pleaded . " When Marcia was suspended ? When the parents hounded me ? When the principal murmured to me that we must go along with the times ' ? When no one wanted what I had to give ? " He looked anxiously and with despair at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all your life , did n't you ? Are you still teaching  --  teaching the stupid multitudes , over and over ? Why ? " He jumped to his feet . " I do n't care any longer ! I 've lost my spirit , too . I 'm quitting . I 'm not going to struggle to teach the Apollonian art to morons , or try to teach it . Why should I inspire them ? Why should I struggle against the system ? Are they my children ? Tell me , are they my chil-dren ? " He had had no intention of pressing the button , but now his despairing extremity interfered with his prudence . He ran to the curtains and pressed the button . The curtains rolled apart , as if weary . And then he saw the light and who stood in the light . He stood there for a long time . He cried a little . He blew his nose and cried again . " Pardon me , " he said . " I have n't cried for a long time . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Man who Listens , and his whole face trembled 204The Teacher " Yes , " he said , " you were , and are , a teacher . You 've never stopped teaching and trying to teach , have you ? You never gave up . Did you ever encounter parents such as I encounter , and authorities ? Of course you did . It did n't matter to you , did it ? The eating , restless , pushing multitudes  --  you still taught them , did n't you ? When they laughed at you and lurched away from you and cursed you , you still taught them . When the higher authorities denounced you , you still taught . You labored , as I did , in a wilderness . " Because you had Authority . " He looked humbly at the man in the light . " And I have authority , above parents , above school boards who are afraid of their own positions . A teacher alwayshas authority to teach the truth . If only one  --  How many did you have all your life ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sudden understanding , it is enough , is n't it ? It is more than enough . " How tired you must have been ! Are you tired now ? No , I do n't think.so . One out of multitudes is enough for you .

And what a class you had  --  have ! Compared with mine , it was almost hopeless . It is almost hopeless . " But if you could  --  can  --  still teach , then so can I. I can refresh myself every day , thinking of you . I can go on , because you went on , and still go on . " He went to the man , very slowly . He touched his hand . " Teacher , " he said , " let me teach again . And Marcia . We205The Listenercan marry ; it 's just that we were afraid . And now I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who strengthens me .

Felix Arnstein smiled at his patient . " You could have called anyone locally , Jim , " he said . " I 've told you ; it 's your gall bladder . And now this time are you going to let me make arrangements for taking the darrtu thing out when we get home ? " " Now , now , Felix , " said the yellowish fat man with the eyes like varnished raisins . " I 've been reading all about it . There 's this diet . " " I gave you a diet ten years ago , " said Felix Arnstein . " Remember ? If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out once in a while , the thing would n't have blown up this way . Now the bladder is full of stones ; we showed them to you on the X rays . " " Diet ! " snorted Jim Merwin , winking at his slender , pretty wife , who seemed younger than her forty-five years . " If a man ca n't eat what he wants --  ! " 209The Listener " Some can . Some ca n't , " said Felix , trying to remain amiable . ( He wondered if Miss Lillis had been able to soothe his patients in his home city who had had appointments with him today , or if they had immediately flounced off to consult another man . That was the devil , being a general practitioner . He ought to have gone back to the hospital for another two years and then he could now call himself an internist . ) " I know , " he continued , " that some men can eat their bellyfuls of fish and others will have an attack of giant hives if even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're one of the boys who ought to have started dieting in your teens . You did n't . And now you 're over fifty and have a bag of stones that would choke an elephant . What do you say about having it removed next week when you get home ? It does n't make medical history any more when a gall bladder is taken out ; it 's routine . " " Nah , " said Jim Merwin . This time he winked at Felix . He was a winking man , by nature and deliberation . It gave him a reputation for being big and generous and goodnaturedand brought him prosperous business . " I do n't have the time , fella . I 'm not like you medical guys , always able to run to Jamaica or Florida or Sorrento . I got to work . I got to make money . I 've got five kids , ai n't I ? " He was a university graduate ; it made him one-of-the-boys to use illiterate expressions . Felix Arnstein was a small , slender man with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complexion , expressive blue eyes , and thin fair hair . He had been trained , by necessity , to keep an amiable expression on hisThe Doctorface . But sometimes , as of now , it was almost impossible . Jim Merwin , with his chain of sports-equipment shops , was at least a millionaire . He belonged to all the country clubs which were firmly closed to Felix ; he had a house at Cape Cod , as well as his fine house in their mutual distant home city , and he visited Florida and other choice spots several times every winter . But that , of course , was business , and tax-exempt , including Lucy Merwin 's expenses . She had once been his stenographer ; she took " notes " on their excursions . She had stenography notebooks to prove it . Felix was tired . Lucy had called him in panic , longdistance , at four o'clock this morning . Jim had been taken sick with one of his " attacks " while attending a convention in this strange city . " Really terrible this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , your tablets do n't " help ! .. . What ? . . . Oh , Felix ! You know Jim would n't have anyonebut you ! And in a different city , and a hotel , at that ! He would n't trust anybody but you ! Look , I 've already called the airport , Felix . There 's a plane at five-thirty . You can just make it if you hurry . You can be here at seven . Just pick up the tickets at the airport . Felix , you 've got to come ! " She sobbed . " I think it 's a heart attack this time , or maybe that gall bladder has ruptured , as you said it might . Or something . ... No ! He 's too sick to get up and fly home just now . He 's all doped up , though it does n't stop the pain much . " So Felix Arnstein had wearily dragged himself out of bed . He had hardly warmed it ; he had been out on an emergency call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a close friend , had died of a heart attack only half an hour after Felix'szio 211The Listenerarrival . It had been a bad blow , a shock . He said to his wife , Gay , as she looked at him with sleepy concern , " Go back to sleep , honey . I must go out . I 'll leave a note for you on the breakfast table . " He did not tell her he was leaving town . The Jim Merwins of this world were the backbone of a general practitioner 's life . They paid large bills and did not complain . It gave them a sort of eclat to receive such bills , even from a general practitioner . " Give me a general doc every time , " they would say , and they would wink if they were winking men like Jim Merwin . " Not these specialists who 're always out golfing or on vacations and never at home on the weekends . What them specialists know , fellers like Felix Arnstein 's already forgotten . " Maybe so , maybe so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the specialists were cleverer men than he , and so they 'd arranged to be born of wealthier parents who could afford to send them to medical school and give them a large allowance besides . Or the specialists had not married in poverty as he had married . They had waited until they were at least partially established . But he was already thirty-one when he completed his internship ; there had been three years when he had had to stop everything to work to pay his way . Three years between his university degree and the medical school : Gay would have waited , but she had already waited for him for over ten years , and he loved her and needed her . She had continued to work in the largest departmentstore for two years after they were married , until their son , Jerome , had notified them of his coming . Felix then had an income almost as large as a mechanic 's , after expenses. 212The DoctorHe was sharing an office with another doctor on the third floor of a made-over old house in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secretaryreceptionist , two filing cases , one telephone , and a handsome set of medical books bought secondhand  --  and unread  --  from a specialist . " He never opened the damned things from the day he got them from his parents when he set up shop , " said Dr. Robert Sherman to his colleague . " But he did n't need to ; he just walked into a fine big office next to his dad 's , with a secretary in silk stockings and a peekaboo blouse and a receptionist who looked like a model . That 's all . Just took over his dad 's rich practice . He had it made . ' ' If I 'd just stayed in the hospital for another two years , Felix would think , I 'd have had it made too . But I could n't . Gay and I had waited too long as it was . Jerome had brought his " luck " with him . At least his cominghad forced his parents to search for a little larger apartment , though more expensive and in a better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air of integrity , and Gay was charming , as bright and vivacious as a bird , with auburn hair and shining blue eyes . They soon attracted the attention of their neighbors in the apartment house . Many of them were elderly people with no children , and some were childlesswidows . Gay 's obviously pregnant state had drawn the solicitude of the ladies in the self-operating elevators . She was also the youngest woman in the building , and her trustinglittle smile and eager ways excited maternal feelings in the older , lonelier women . The ladies visited her , clucking , warning , advising . One was the widow of a physician , who213The Listener The Doctorhad left her comfortably wealthy . Of course she took an interestnot only in Gay but in Felix . She gave a cocktail party for them a week before Jerome was born , and all the guests liked the young couple . The next step came when some called Felix in emergencies when their own doctors were sick or otherwise unavailable . The following step was when they decided to stay with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother 's hair and eyes , his father 's reserved but engaging ways . He became the pet of the whole apartment house , from the janitor to the owner , who lived on the top floor . Felix 's fortunes began to look up definitely . He and Gay talked of a " little home somewhere , for Jerome 's sake , with grass and trees . " ( They did not talk of more children ; they could not afford them . ) Then the war came , and Felix had to go . As he was not a specialist , he never rose above the rank of lieutenant . He did not see Gay and Jerome again for four years . Four terrible years . He saved what he could ; he knew Gay saved all she could from her allotment . What he did not know was that Gay had gone back to work , leaving Jerome in the wise old care of the physician 's widow . He did not know until Gay , laughing through her tears after their first embrace when he came home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " Our down payment , " she said . " See , it 's in another bank . I saved two thousand from your pay too . " Jerome was five years old . They bought a pretty little suburban house for not more than twice its actual worth ; inflation had begun . Dr. Sherman , who had not been drafted , 214moved out of the office . Felix had it for himself now . He had eight thousand dollars in the bank , after the house was bought , a large mortgage , a secondhand car ; half his former patients returned to him . He and Gay had never had a week 's holiday in their married life or even before that . Gay had an elderly great-uncle , a sullen , irascible old man with bunions , a hearing aid , and a high suspicion of everyonebut Gay . he was obviously not a man of material substance . After he had had a heart attack , he 1kanted , he said plaintively , to move into the old folks ' home , to forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had been living alone for forty years in a side-street hotel , in one room . He had once been a diamond cutter , and Gay could not recall ever having seen him in a new suit or wearing a new hat . She had been kind to him for years , for no reason except that she was naturally kind . She insisted that he move into her house , " and Felix will be there all the time  --  at least some of the time  --  to watch over you . " Felix did not think highly of the idea . Old Harry Stern had never been one of his favorite people , but Gay , who had worked so hard for this house , deserved to have her uncle here if she wished . So old Harry Stern moved in , with his endless complaints , his prayer shawls , his skullcaps , his peevish comments on Gay 's cooking , his shouts at Jerome , his insistence on ancient ritual , his heavy colds , his fiendishly stinking cheap cigars , and his habit of bursting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treated very unkindly when she had been alive . He died suddenly while Felix was struggling to re-establish his practice . A lawyer called , with a will , after Felix and Gay215The Listenerhad buried the old man with all the ritual they knew he had wanted . Old Harry Stern had been living on an annuity which he had shrewdly bought forty years ago and which had paid him one hundred dollars a month for life . He had left ten thousand dollars in cash to Gay . Felix judiciously restrained his jubilation in respect for the dead . He found himself suddenly very fond of sly old Harry . He made a substantial payment on the mortgage , which reducedmonthly interest and payments . Then he rented an office  --  a small one  --  in a good medical section of the city , in a new splendid building all white brick , chrome , and selfopeningdoors and switchboards and parking lots and big windows . " I think , " he said cautiously to his wife , " that we 're finally on the way . " He , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building . Worse , even most of the specialists were younger than he . They did not despise him ; secretly they had let him have the office in their jointly owned building for much less than they could have rented it to a bright young specialist with sound parental money behind him . General practitioners referredpatients to specialists , especially if the specialists were handy , on the same floor or the next , and especially if the specialists were kind and displayed fellowship and had G.P. 's to dinner occasionally and introduced them " around . " " We are certainly on the way , " Felix said to his wife when he paid off the mortgage entirely . He now had at least eighteen men like Jim Merwin as patients , and as they usually overate or overworked or abused their bodies in countless other ways and firmly believed in regular " check-ups " and all the latest216The Doctor " shots , " Felix , who would by nature have detested them , spoke of them as " our bank accounts . " Jerome was seventeen and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he wished to be a doctor . He was already eight inches taller than Felix , and an excellentstudent . " That 's no news to me , " said Felix , smiling at his son tenderly . " I 've watched you for years reading my medical books . What kind of a specialist do you want to be ? " he added jovially . " I do n't want to be a specialist , Dad , " said Jerome , who was as reticent as his father . " I want to be a general practitioner . Like you . " " Good God ! Why ? " " Because I want to be the kind of man you are . " " I ? What in the name of hell do you mean by that stupid statement ? " Jerome had blushed . He was naturally inarticulate . " Well , " he said uncomfortably , " I just think that this country needs fewer specialists and more G.P. 's . That 's all . " Ile took a deep breath and plunged on , awkwardly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many compartments ! If you 're sick in one part , you 're sick all over . Besides  --  well , I think of a G.P. as a healer . ' A helper , if you know what I mean . A friend . A specialist 's all steel and chrome and impersonal . You see  --  well , it 's this way : I like people . " " You do , eh ? " said Felix a little grimly , thinking of the Jim Merwins . " I do n't . " " Yes , you do , " said Jerome , smiling at him with Gay 's own smile. 217It was all nonsense ; it was all stupid . He 'd expected better than this for Jerome . But the boy , in his way , was as stubbornas himself . Felix threatened not to send him to medical school . Jerome only smiled . " Do you want a life like mine ? " cried Felix . " Never knowing if you can get a full night 's sleep ? At the beck and call of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Delivering a baby for about fifty dollars ? Those who can afford more go to an obstetrician . Wangling and waiting for years to get a little spot on the hospital staff ? You do n't know the snobbery in the medical department , my boy . The specialists despise you , though they keep their doors open for your patients . The nurses even despise you . The staff officers despise you . You can never belong even to the better Jewish clubs ; you ca n't afford them , anyway . Do you know what my income is , even now , after all these years , after expenses ? Twelve thousand dollars a year ! And I 'm lucky to get that . And you want to be a man like me ! " " Yes , " said Jerome . " You have no ambition . Why , that little squirt of a proctologist down the hall from me clears over twice what I do in a year , and he 's only thirty-five . I 'm fifty . When he 's my age he 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rich man . " Jerome only smiled . Jerome was in a good university now , with an excellent medical school , and he was nineteen . He and his father had no more arguments . Felix hoped and prayed that the boy 's teachers would be able to persuade him where he had failed . Gay said , " If Jerome is half as good as you , dear , and has218your integrity and gets half the love you do from your patients , I 'll be very happy . " " Love ! " said Felix . " From the Jim Merwins ? " " They 're not the only ones , dear . " " Sure . The others do n't pay their bills , or they take years to do it . A doctor 's always the last to get paid . " He touched her hand . " I bought you that mink coat eight years ago , and it was n't good quality to begin with . " But the Lucy Merwins changed their minks at least every other year . They had their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a cheap one even when new . Lucy Merwin had diamonds . Gay had only , even now , the one-carat engagement ring Felix had given her and which had taken him over four years to pay for in full . They spent two weeks every winter in a motel near Miami Beach , and two weeks in the summer at a little cottage " on the lake " which had no utilities . When they had paid their real estate taxes and the school taxes , the twelve thousand dollars a year had shrunk to less than ten . They lived frugally ; Gay did all the housework herself . They saved to send Jerome through medical school . They had two annuities on which they were paying , and a life insurance policy for twenty-five thousand dollars . And Felix was fifty-two . He needed some new equipment for his office . He was also saving for an X-ray machine . This would annoy some of the specialists , but he had become desperate on reaching the age he now was . " There 's no place in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say to Gay . " No one wants , or needs , personal at-tention. " 219The Listener " Oh yes , that 's exactly what they do want ! " cried Gay , whose auburn hair was very gray now . " Did n't you know that ? " She added , " The poor people . And I do n't mean financiallypoor , either . " Today , in this strange city , in this opulent hotel , Felix suddenly thought of what Gay had said . " The poor people . " He looked at fat , winking , yellowish Jim Merwin and at his . wife , Lucy , who was only three years younger than Gay but appeared to be at least twelve years younger , with her touched-up hair , her smooth face , her soft white hands , her slender figure . They had engaged a splendid room f ' ; , " our doe " in this same hotel ; in fact , next door . " Notl ' Ag too good for you , old Felix , " said Jim Merwin , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you stay over a couple of days more , and then we 'll all go back together ? " " No , thanks , " said Felix . " I have a big list of appointmentstomorrow . I 'm taking the midnight plane back . " It was a beautiful spring day . " Now that I 've gotten you quieted down and assured you that you are n't going to die immediately , I think I 'll take a walk , " said Felix . " Anything worthwhile to see locally , besides the usual things ? " " Nope . Except that maybe you want to see that funny thing they got here . Show him that pamphlet , Luce . Crazy thing . " Felix put on his glasses and studied John Godfrey 's pamphlet . The Man who Listens . " That 's interesting , " said Felix . " Who goes there ? " " Oh , " said Lucy , " one of the local girls was telling me220The Doctorabout it . People in trouble who want someone to listen to them . Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need a psychiatrist , that 's what . Who else wants to listen ? " Felix took off his glasses and absently laid them down . He kept the pamphlet in his hand . He thought of Jerome , for whom he had had such large ambitions . Who could he tell of Jerome ? The specialists he knew ? Gay , who was contented ? He put the pamphlet in his pocket . " I 'll be back in an hour or so , " he said . He forgot the pamphlet before he was in the hotel lobby . He thought he would buy a newspaper , then find a park nearby , if there was one , and sit in the sun and read . The sun was very warm . He felt for his glasses and remembered he had left them in Jim 's room . He went to the elevator and got off on the right floor and went down the richly carpeted hall to Jim 's suite . The transom was open . Then he heard Jim say with contempt , " Felix ? Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! We shouldn't 've called him ; that was your idea . Oh , shut up ; all right , it was my idea ! With all that damn pain . You can bet he 'll send me a bill as long as your arm ! Always trust a Jew doctor to do that . " To the bank , bank , bank ! ' That 's all they think of . " " Oh , now , " laughed Lucy , with that sweet , joyous , cruel laugh of women who are amused at the spoken deprecation of others . " You think of money too , darling . " " Sure , but not the way Jews do . Hoarding it . Bet he could buy and sell me . Look at this car of his ; at least four years old , and not a big job , either . Gay 's got that old ragged fur for years ; you 'd think he 'd be ashamed to let her be seen in221The Listenerit . And a house you could put in one corner of ours . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money when I was still a clerk in one of the sports shops I own now . Do n't you worry any about a Jew . Look what it cost me to bring him here , and the hotel room , and the bill . He 'll make me sting ; you can bet on that . Get me a drink ; double . " Felix backed slowly away from the door , his face white , the muscles about his mouth rigid and hard . He , a mild and gentle man , was trembling with hate and rage and humiliation . He 'd never permit Jim Merwin to enter his office again . Yes , he would . He needed the Jim Merwins . Because he was a general practitioner , of no status . He was sick when he reached the lobby again . He looked at the newspaper in his hand . He could not read it without glasses , he thought numbly . And he could not go into that suite  --  yet . Not yet , if he wanted to keep the Jim Merwins . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Damn him , " he said aloud , thinking of all his work , all Gay 's work . And then he thought of Jerome , who would be a general practitioner . He put his hands helplessly in his pockets , and one of them encountered the pamphlet . The Man who Listens . " Hell , " he said . But he went out and found a cab . The flowering shrubs and trees about the white building were just bursting into spring bloom , pink , red , magenta , bright yellow , brilliant white , purple , rose , fuchsia . Tulips and daffodils and hyacinths stood in the warm brown earth , row upon row of them . The red gravel paths sparkled in the fine sun . Felix slowly walked up one of the paths , looking at the square white structure against the intensely blue sky . He222The Doctorsaw a bench on which an old man was sitting , his hands on his cane . The old man was smiling at a squirrel . Felix hesitated , then stopped . He said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the Man who Listens  --  up there ? " The old man looked at him tranquilly . " I do n't know . No one knows . He only listens . Some people think he 's a doctor , or a teacher , or a social worker , or a priest . Half the people who talk to him never want to see him ; half do . You can choose for yourself . " " Did you ever go ? " asked Felix . " Yes , I did . I talked for a long time . But I did n't press the button near the curtains . I want to have my own picture of him . I was going to kill myself , " said the old man with calm simplicity . " But after I talked to him , I did n't . " " That 's interesting , " said Felix in the pleasant voice that inspired trust . " Would you mind telling me what he said to you ? " The old man looked thoughtful . He took off his old hat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . " I do n't know , " he said . " I do n't remember that he said a thing . Perhaps he did ; perhaps he did n't . Frankly , I do n't know , and that 's all I can tell you . I only know that I had peace for the first time in seventy-five years . And that 's a long time to live in hell , is n't it ? " He looked at Felix 's white , strained face and the pain in his blue eyes . He said kindly , " Why do n't you go and talk to him yourself ? I think you need to . " Felix colored and set his shoulders stiffly . He almost turned away . Then he glanced at the building again . He223The Listenerfrowned . Well , it would do no harm to tell someone , anonymous , who would never see him , of the Jim Merwins . The damn Jim Merwins . He entered the sitting room and saw two people waiting in silence , a young woman , a youth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he saw the stony shine of despair on their still faces , the hollows of suffering . A young woman , as thin as a corpse . A young man Jerome 's age . It was terriblefor anyone to suffer ; it was even more terrible when the young suffered . He wondered who they were . With a practiced eye he evaluated their clothing . The girl was expensively dressed . The boy wore poor shoes and a worn suit . They did not glance at the newcomer ; they were absorbed in a timeless agony of their own . Felix suddenly thought : The poor people ! Impatiently he put the words out of his mind . He saw the slit where a brass plate above it invited visitors to drop a note about their problems . No offering was asked . A psychiatrist or a doctor  --  certainly . Who else ? He sat down , feeling foolish , and waited . An old woman crept into the room , timidly . Obviously a cleaning woman , from her scored hands and clothing and the painful way she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who suffered was the sufferingof the lonely aged who had no one , who must work until they dropped dead . He smiled encouragingly at the old woman and stood up and helped her to a chair . Her feet were swollen ; edema . Heart ? The pallor of death was on her cheeks ; the shadow of death was in her eyes . The poor people . Damn , thought Felix . He saw the old hands , scarred , 224The Doctorbroken almost to bleeding , the nails corroded . She saw him looking ; she lifted her white head and stared at him with pride , rejecting his awful pity . The old , familiar , tearing pity that had torn at him when he had closed dead and hopeless eyes in miserable rooms , when he had to tell a mother that her child was dying or a husband that his wife was breathing her last breath , when he comforted a stricken wife whose husband would never speak to her again ! Somehow these things always happened after midnight , when the specialists were cozily asleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or London , or in South America . Felix thought of the tired priests and ministers and rabbis who had stood with him in those anguished moments , and how they had looked at him as at a colleague , knowing his pity and sorrow . He had felt a strange and poignant fellowship with them , these shabby men in shabby rooms . A bell chimed softly . The young woman and youth had disappeared . Felix hesitated . The old woman said curtly , " It 's your turn . " " I 'll wait ; you go first , " he said , looking at her feet again . " No . That would n't be fair . You 're supposed to take your turn , " said the old woman firmly . She panted a little , and he heard it and frowned . Felix went into the white room with the marble chair and the closed blue curtains . He examined everything with the objective curiosity of a physician . He went to the spot where visitors dropped their notes . He smiled a little , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall . So " they " read the notes , then gave advice . There was a slanting cover that con-225The Listener The Doctorcealed the top and he opened it . He smelled the acridness of burning paper . Then he saw that the slit outside admitted the notes and they were burned at once at the bottom of the litte shaft . He coud see a faint flicker of flame far at the bottom and , caught at the side on a little roughness of the metal , the wavering flutter of a ten-dollar bill . Its end was already charred . So no one read the notes ; they were invited , he could understand , so that the visitors could first acquire confidence in expressing themselves , thus clarifying their minds . " Very sensible , " murmured Felix . " Psychologically sound . " He walked reluctantly to the chair , then leaned on its back , facing the curtains . He was very curious again . " I like to talk to some people , " he said . " But I 'd prefer not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there 's an old dying woman waiting outside . She probably needs to talk to you more than I do . I think I 'll call her in . " He went to the door through which he had entered . It could not be opened except on the farther side . He went to the curtains and read the little brass plate sunk in the marble wall . " Well , I hope they thank you , " he said . The room waited . It had a calmness as of absolute eternity , where time did not exist . Felix thought of his everlastinglycrowded waiting room ; the walls inside were lined , too , and sometimes patients had to wait outside in the hall . The specialists would often pass in the hall and would look expectantly at the faces . A kidney case here , an arthritic patient there ; obviously this was a heart case , another as obviously cancer , or this or that . Old Felix would226refer this one or that one ; it had been an excellent idea to have an old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a cut , either . Yes , an excellent idea . Felix could see his waiting room sharply and clearly , the frightened faces of the patients , the dun clothing , the shoddy shoes , the bandannas of some of the poorer women , the children whose faces were twisted with apprehension . And then , when he appeared , the sudden lightening , the hope , the diffident smiles . Well , that was all very nice ! But the thin sheaf of checks at the end of the month was n't so heartening , as his secretary pointed out , he was lucky to get a check for every six bills ; he was lucky , sometimes , ever to get anything at all . He turned bills over to the collection agency only when he was positive that the patients were trying to cheat him or when they had the ability to pay at least in small installments . He was a fool . He was fifty-two and , outside of the score or so of the Jim Merwins , he 'd never been able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who could sponsor those who could not pay . He found himself sitting in the chair . He faced the curtains . " I suppose you 're a doctor , " he said . " Well , meet a fellow sufferer . I 'm a G.P. Are you ? " He did not hear a sound , a voice , or a rustle , or a movement . Yet all at once he was certain he had heard a murmur of affirmation somewhere . He looked about sharply . He 'd been imagining things ! Your mind could play tricks on you in such a quiet place , where there was no time , no intrusion , nothing but yourself facing  --  who ? " I heard you are here twenty-four hours a day , " he said227The Listenerwith his faint , skeptical smile . " Well , I 'm like that too . On call twenty-four hours a day . I 'm lucky if I 'm able to get five hours ' sleep a night , a few nights a week . Do n't you get tired too ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a negative one . He rubbed his ears until they were pink . " You do n't ? " he said incredulously . " When do you sleep ? " The white walls and ceilings smiled at him . He sat upright . " Do n't you have parents ? Brothers ? Sisters ? Children ? " The gentle warmth flowed about him , assenting . He forgot to wait for a voice . He did not know how it was , but he was content with the sensation of listening , of assent or dissent . He had not thought of his old grandfather for years , in his skullcap , sitting near the kitchen stove in his mother 's house , warming his hands in the winter and rocking in the comfortable chair she had always kept for him . His grandfather had rarely spoken ; he had only listened , and very often he had smiled . It was enough ; he understood , and answered , without words . " You remind me of my grandfather , " Felix said suddenly . " Are you old ? Very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or both ? Felix sat back in the chair . He said nothing . He thought of Gay and Jerome and the little worldly evidences of success he possessed and of the Jim Merwins . Time passed ; or , rather , it seemed not to be at all . Felix started , came to himself . " I suppose , " he said , " I should tell you my troubles . " Then  --  he must be losing his mind !  --  he was positive that someone had been listening to his thoughts all this time228The Doctorand that the man behind the curtain knew everything about him . This unnerved Felix a little . A skeptic , he had smiled at extra-sensory perception , though he had admitted that there might be " something to it , something that will be explained easily enough sometime . " Was the man who was listening gifted with ESP ? All at once Felix was certain of it . He was more than ever unnerved . He cleared his throat . He had had to learn , while still a child at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People disliked vehemence or anything else that threatened their superficial lives or disturbed their determined " happiness . " They were particularly offended by people in trouble , or at least by those who revealed in expression , abstraction , or gesture that they were in trouble . Everything must be " happiness . " " A damn-fool phrase , " said Felix aloud . " ' Happiness . ' That 's for babies . I wonder when we 'll grow up as a nation and learn there 's no happiness ' ? You should see my waiting room , or the waiting room of any doctor , or the wards in the hospitals ! Yet even the patients , when leaving , will put on a smirk as if to show the displeased world that they are happy , ' too , even if death is in their bodies . So they 'll be accepted by the happiness cultists ' and not be rejected as unpleasant reminders that there 's pain in the world , and death and funerals . " He shifted , hotly vexed , in his chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " Yes , there was a war on  --  another damn-fool phrase . A war on . ' As if there is n't all the time , somewhere . But , discounting the war , the people seemed more adult , in some way . No one expected anyone to be229The Listener The Doctorhappy , happy , happy . ' If you were , then you were to be congratulated . But no one demanded it as a rite you must perform in public , as a social duty . No one thought you were inferior or degraded if you were in misery , as they do in America . ' What the hell is all this happiness ' bit , anyway ? " He looked at the curtains . " But that is n't what I came to tell you . It 's just something that 's been like a flea irritating my mind all the time . " He was a nervous man but always concealed his nervousnessexcept in his constant cigarette-smoking . He felt for his cigarette case . Then the desire passed and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his neck and shoulder muscles was ebbing away ; it was a strange sensation , this ease , one he had n't felt for a long time . He said abruptly , " I 've wanted happiness ' for my son , Jerome . I 've wanted an easier life for him , not like mine . I 've wanted him to have success , so that he can --  " He stared at the curtains . " Why , damn it , so he may be accepted by the Jim Merwins of the world and join their clubs and not be outside the pale ! So he can play golf with them , and bet with them , and be invited to their houses , and have as good a car as they have , and a house at least as fine as theirs , and marry some nice girl of good family who has money ! A social success ! Not to be outside the pale ! " He felt sick with his embarrassment and shame . But he made his voice challenging . " Do you know what that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it means , being a Jew ? I do ! " The room appeared to enfold him with sadness and2 30comprehension , and yet with hope . " You 're a Jew ! " he exclaimedincredulously . " A Jew ? A Jewish doctor ? " He stopped , straining toward the curtains . Then he sighed . " If you are and you have a son , you 'll understand why I wanted more for Jerome than I had for myself . Oh , Gay gets impatient with me . She says , What does that matter ? Pale , nothing . Everybody 's outside of some pale . If they only admit one or two Jews to Jim Merwin 's clubs , and they Supreme Court judges or something , they also have a quota on Catholics . A Catholic member has to die before another is admitted , and they have to be top-drawer . Just to associate with the Jim Merwins ! The Italians and the Poles are outsidesome invisible pale , and so are millions of others , through lack of education or money or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jews outside a pale of their own ! It 's a nasty human custom . ' " Felix laughed shortly . " I suppose , in a way , that Gay 's right . But I do n't want Jerome to encounter any more pales than he has to . I want him to be hap --  " He stopped , and his fair skin became brightly pink . " Oh , damn , " he murmuredsheepishly . Then he was defiant again . " All right , so I 'm stupid . Let 's forget what I said . I 've been wandering . I do n't , I think , want Jerome to have enough money so he can associate with the Jim Merwins . At least I do n't now . But I do want him to be a specialist so he 'll have an easier life than mine , a more secure life , and not be a grubber like me , with my door and my telephone open twenty-four hours a day . For the sick . " Had the room become slightly cooler , more withdrawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He stroked his eyebrows in agitation . " Perhaps , " he said , " I do n't mean it quite that way . After all , I 'm a physician , and the sick are my charges . Yes , my charges . It 's funny , but I do n't know if I 've consciouslythought of them like that before . " Then after a little he brightened . " Well , yes , I have . Underneath , I mean . I 've been mixed up , I think . That 's what comes of being a father . At one time all physicians were priests , thousands of years ago , and they did n't marry and they did n't have children . They dedicated their lives to healingthe sick and comforting them and giving them courage to face death . Can you understand an attitude like that ? I think I can . Now . " He was silent for a long time , thinking . His thoughts flowed quickly , bringing thousands of pictures before him . The strain left his face . He began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When Gay inherited that ten thousand dollars from old Harry Stern , she said to me , Now you can go back for a few years ' more study . If you want to . To become a specialist . If you want to . ' And she looked at me with her pretty eyes and waited . " Felix sat up straight , excited . " Do you know what I said ? Oh , it does n't matter . ' I thought I was thinking that we 'd better use the money to pay off the mortgage or something . But I was n't ! Away back in my mind was the thought that I just wanted to be a G.P. , with my door and telephone open twenty-four hours a day for people who knew that specialists had certain hours , and appointments rigidly scheduled , and a telephone-answering service which they did n't bother to232The Doctorcheck if they had a dinner appointment or a golf date , or a weekend coming up at someone 's country home . " As if , " said Felix with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or dying or injured , or when to have a baby ! I know one obstetrician who actually does schedule the babies ! If he wants a winter holiday , he takes his patients to the hospital and induces birth . Sometimes it 's all right . And sometimes it is n't ! But even the women who lose their babies swear by him . He has charm . I do n't . " He brooded on that . Then he said , " But I have something else . My patients trust me . When they call their priest or minister or rabbi , they call me too . Even when they know I ca n't help them any longer . Now that 's something , is n't it ? " His tired face was bright and excited . He forgot to control his emotions . He jumped up and walked rapidly up and down the room , gesticulating , murmuring to himself . " People are people . They can pretend to be civilized and brave and sophisticated , but when it comes to death they are all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the white shirts I have for them , before examination , they 're all the same . The same human faces , the same emotions , the same fears , the same hopes , the same loves and hates . They are only men . Even , " he said , " the Jim Merwins . " He stopped . All his hatred for Jim Merwin was gone . Why , the poor , fat , suffering , cowardly bastard , he thought fondly . He 's scared to death of an operation . He thinks he might die . Then what about his money and his clubs and nice smooth Lucy ? He knows she 'll marry again before he's233The Listenercold . And those kids of his ! He does n't know , nor Lucy , either , that the shine in his eyes , his pampered eighteenyear-olddaughter , is coming to me to be cured of syphilis . His innocent little ewe lamb .

I charge her five dollars a shot , which is one fourth her weekly allowance . She 'll be cured soon , and she 's a different girl now . Thanks to me . He looked at the curtains , and again he had the thought that he had been heard . " I 'm thinking , " he said , " of all the people who might die because they ca n't afford specialists . I do n't mean the poverty-stricken , who get the same treatment free from specialists that the rich get . I mean the lower middle class , the people I have . They can pay so much , and they know it . So without the G.P. they 'd get no treatment at all , and they 'd go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd die . " He smiled at the curtains . " Do you know the most wonderfulthing my son ever said to me  --  that anyone ever said to me ? I want to be a man like you . ' Now what greater satisfaction can a man have than that ?

But that does n't matter , does it ? " He took out his handkerchief and wiped his eyes . " For why was a man born , anyway , except to help his fellow man , to heal him , to comfort him ?

Not the kind of " nice " ways some folks had , being pretty sweet about " the poor working people " and all the time they did n't give a darn about " the poor working people . " It just sounded nice to them and their friends coming in for cocktail parties . She 'd heard more talk about the " rights " of the working people for the past twenty years than she 'd ever heard before , and it did n't mean a thing . Not a thing . Funny . The ladies who employed her would talk for hours  --  just hours  --  to their cocktail friends about progress and Labor . You could hear their high voices , talking , talking , getting excited ; you could listen from the2 **25;2417;TOOLONG indicate the mechanical frustration of impulses that should have been controlled by mind .

The truth is , it was kind of fun . " How had it ended ? " I seduced him , of course , " she said , with such a happy explosion of laughter that I could only conclude she had escaped briefly from the present to that strange point where memory can satisfy the bruised nerves and dishonored body . " After all that time it was great ! Jesus Christ ! But you know , for two or three weeks Clem kept pretendinghe did n't know what was going on . He 'd break off a conversation in the middle and have at me , and as soon as he was dressed and back where he 'd been sitting before he gave in he 'd pick up the sentence exactly where he left it off . Oh , he was funny . And if I 'd mention it he was apt to break into tears and look over his shoulder like he was remembering Paradise . " Only , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly he normaledup . It was spring , you see , and before you knew it I had a roaringboy on my hands . It was just like we 'd picked up from the summer before the war began , but it was n't like he 'd suffered any loss of mind or memory in all this time between . It was , truly it was , more like what he said . " And what Clem had said  --  presumably known in some questionablesense of that word  --  was that a child had been delivered into the world in that wartime spring , an ephemera who was not so much his double as his echo , a kind of invisible imprint made by his energies on the essential stuff of the world . ( All the terms I can muster are terriblyuncertain , so much so that I can take them only as descriptive of a psychic state . But precisely that is what counts most in the developmentI am trying to trace . ) The child had a sort of sexual origin . Its recognition , at least , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sex life . The child lived in incredible peril . The massed cunning and fury of the war was , indeed , aimed at " getting it . " At the same time it was invulnerable to everything except sonic magic betrayal that he sometimes referred to as " denial . " The presence of this immaterial child in Clem 's thought was certainly not a hallucination , nor had there ever been anything particularlyobsessive in the way he spoke of it . When it was mentioned he/tween them , he was willing enough to label it a " memorable fancy " or disparage it as a notion  --  even to say that it was lacking in value to the extent that it was difficult to describe concretely . He claimed no communication with it . He did not expect it to be , in any way , a guardian spirit ; rather , the shoe was on the other foot , he was obligatedto defend it as well as he could . In other words , he seemed to reorganize his rationality around this irrational projection without conceding it any authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oddest thing about all this is that Sheila , who had categorized the rest of his mysticism either as an ominous nuisance or as fun ( depending on where it seemed to lead practically ) , came to believe in " the child " very much as he did . The undescribed and questionably real thing was there , like an imaginary point in space where all the discernible hopes of their lives converged . She believed that the recognition of the child , whatever it might be , had permitted Clem 's return to her , and naturally she was grateful to it . In this phase he had come far enough to mock at his ideas of developing a breath body or diamond body , had socialized his opposition to the war sufficiently to consider registering as a conscientious objector . Actually he was already registered for the draft as " atheist , " and attempts to change at this late date might have involved him in formidable legal tangles , which in turn might well have roused again his stubborn intent to become catatonic rather than serve . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eroded his resistance . Not that even here the idea worked directly on him , but under its benigninfluence he was reassembling the structure of a personality that at last wanted to engage with the given world . By the time he was drafted in January 1943 Clem was conscientiously " trying on " the commonplaces that guided so many others willingly into the services . Only one virtue of the old Clem was conspicuously absent in the new man  --  he would not attempt to write , and he read only those things which , in his view , would improve his character . ( The only exampleSheila gave of this was Prescott 's Conquest of Mexico , from which Clem derived the notion that he ought to be like Montezuma ! ) He seemed to be afraid of writing , and , to the extent that this was a reasoned fear , his reason was that composition would require the psychic energies that now had been dedicated to " preservation of the child in the midst of war . " She had been prepared to hear nothing from him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day he left for induction he kept insistingthat she go on with her life as if he had never existed so that they would be invulnerable to circumstances that might prey on them if they did not wholeheartedly accept their separation . She was to take up with other men  --  almost whether she wanted to or not !  --  and he would let old nature take its course . They would remain linked by purely " spiritual means . " He would not trust mechanical communications , he said . Or that was what it amounted to . There was more danger to them in scrambled communication than in prolongedsilence . They had come to no agreement on that , though on everything else they had come to what Sheila remembered as a nearly perfect harmony . She had put him on the train to be inducted swearing that she would be true to him and would write . Sadly he shook his head and promised he would live the life of a soldier and never answer . Letters began to come from him within a month . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sum , they were better than anything else he had ever written . Clem had  --  always  --  thought so too . Wherever they moved after the war they had carted along the trunk full of his wartime letters like a kind of household god . Clem had never used them in anything he wrote later , though he had alwayssaid that he meant to someday . It had seemed to them both that it was enough that the letters existed . For when they began to arrive , first from the camps in the Southeast and then from England and France , Sheila knew that she had won . They were the personality she had brought to birth in happiness and against odds . Just because the odds were so great against anything of the sort happening , the victory they represented was that much more clearly defined . The letters were the sign that what he had required in the most extravagantand world-refusing excursions of the spirit could be made tangible  --  nearlytangible  --  in his relation to her . They were the sign of the great marriage that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the way they lived together after the formal ceremonyhad been performed . Listening to all this , tucking much of it away undigested to ruminateon later , I believed her account insofar as one can be said to believe anything couched in unverifiable terms . And in my belief lp303alternated between pity and hope . On the surface it was pitiful to see her turning from the defeat of the present back to a victory no longer pertinent . I thought it would be even more pitiful if she were deluding herself that Clem 's absence now was merely a repetition of his temporaryabsence during the war . But how can the spirit heal itself exceptby withdrawing before it attempts another leap forward ? Was n't it better for her to see the significance of her life in what she took to be its best moments than to dwell on the details that had led to their breaking up ? We had been rambling from bar to bar far south of the Village while she told me this , and I was , at the very least , glad to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her apartment . But there is no end to the degrees of suffering which seem to spin through consciousness like a great ring of endless light , segmented like a spectrum so that disparate kinds may be distinguished , neverthelesscontinuous as life . Passionate in her long talk about the abstractor mystical relations between her and Clem , she had to be calm , I suppose , to bear talking of a concrete act . " I burned all his letters the other day , " she said . I ca n't recall without a shudder the moment she said this . It seems to me I have very seldom stood so perilously in the slippery places as while she waited for my comment . She had truly not meant to drag me into their " muck , " but in realizing this I had made the error of concluding that she was not dangerous . If I had said the wrong thing then , or even an incautious thing , I would have been in the position of a man who is swung on by a very fine-ground blade , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then hears his attacker warning , " Do n't try to shake your head . " If I had said either " So what ? " or " You should n't have , " I would have stepped off into darkness and must thereafter have taken anything she said as diabolical . It was she who had phrased the considerations , drawn the argument of life down to a pinpoint and balanced it there . " They were your letters , " I said . " They were mine , " she answered  --  not diabolically , content to shoulder , since she had to , the load of guilt and love I had refused to topple . " I had to , " she said . " I 'm sure of that . " " It 's not so great a literary loss . "  | " I 'm sure of that too . " " I would n't have , even so , if Clem had let me have them around without reminding me that I had them . He called me about a month ago . " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Oh , dear . He said at first he was only checking to see if I still had them . Something about this damn play of his . He 's still rewriting it . It 's ten million words long if they ever published all the scraps . If no one had said anything in the British Isles between 1943 and ' 45 , he would have said it all for them by this time , Gl 's and natives . But he pretended that he wanted to check something he 'd written to me once about Cecile Potter . " " So you said . . . ? " " That I goddam well did n't want the letters degraded into anything he was writing now . So this started off some low-level comedy dialogue and I accused him of caring more about something he 'd written than he did about the kids , and . . . " While she cried a bit I put my Band-Aid on the gut wound by saying , " It would have been unworthy of you two to bar any holds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . I did n't even read them over before I burned them . Just phweet  --  " she sprinkled her fingers upward  --  " they went into the fireplace . " " I suppose he knows they 're burned . " " I called and told him . " " You had to . " " I did have to . He 's got to break clean , this once . He 's got to give up the notion I have anything he wants . I thought it would teach him  --  " I shook my head . " All right , I did n't think that . He 's hard to educate , and she 'll find that out . Wait until she finds the tape recorder in the bathroom because he has his great ideas when he 's shaving . All that . . . " All that which she was missing so badly . " What happened ? " " The bastard came and camped in my apartment for two or three days after I told him . He sat in that chair by the window all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat all hunched up , crying . Day after day he sat there . Or he slept on the floor . I could n't make him go home . Finally Cinderella got up nerve to call me and see if he was here , and Christ , I was so tired of it by then I told her to come and getp305him while I was at work . I do n't know how she did it . But then , I 've never known how she did it . Clem says she 's got a great soul , and I think he 's probably right . But how . . . " " How will she keep him ? " I prompted when she fell silent . " Oh , she wo n't keep him , " she said peremptorily , as if that part of the future were a foregone conclusion . She smiled eerily . " He wo n't come back to me , either . That 's what you thought I had at the bottom of my sticky little mind , is n't it , Dick ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if , knowing , she must not tell me . With a purposeful shift in tone she said , " You 're going to dinner with them tomorrow night , are n't you ? Cinderella is going to cook her duck . " " You 're in very close communication . " " Or I would n't have been such a jealous bitch to call you down here tonight when you wanted to be with them ? " I took what comfortI could from the lightness of her tone . At least some of the symptomshad been relieved in the last several hours . " Clem told me when you were coming and where you 'd be staying . I was guessing about the duck , but Clem 's mother always sends one at Christmas . I hope you enjoy it . I really do . I mean to enjoy things myself from here on out . I want my kids . The letters are gone . Clem 's gone . That 's the way things are . " Because there was nothing else to be done we clinked our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she asked me to take her home . Purged with fatigue as much as with confession , we took a cab back to her apartment where Bernie was waiting . " Do n't come up , " she said . " I 'll straighten up sometime and then . . . " The street lights struck the whites of her eyes so that for an instant she seemed inwardlyluminous . It may have been  --  it may only have seemed  --  that she had rolled the pupils up under the lid . Her fingernails were on my wrist , between cuff and glove . " I know I never learn from him fast enough to keep up , but was n't there some other way for him to teach me ? " The old doubt , unchanged from college days in spite of all that had intervened and should have driven it away . A doubt that did not correspond with the facts , but was a fact of overwhelming importance . I could n't answer her . " Damn him . He 's got to invent me some kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " By myself I ca n't be sure . " Then she laughed and kissed me and went inside.  |p306Afterward  this evening too would take its place in the complex of knowledge that amounted to a judgment , not so much of weakness as of great strength still insufficient to its task . But even then I knew I would always blame her for burning the letters  --  blame her for doing that to herself and all she loved most . I saw in this act a portent of the way she would helplessly dehumanize the image of their father for her children . Unless they lived in that horrid mental prosperity that simply does not care , they had a chance to grow up thinking their father had been an excellent man , a writer whose books they could cherish doubly because their name was on the spine . That much was secured for them . But the letters , which Sheila had made me see as a birth link betweenmute reality  --  " crazy " reality  --  and the unalterable forms of his published work , were perpetually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truest voice into the voice of a stranger . Of their least corruptible heritage they might think " good " or " true " but could hardly think " ours " since they had no way to determine how it had become his . For " the children " I unavoidably came to substitute the concept of the future or even the more inclusive concept of us  --  we who strain to hear . On the other side of a gulf we have heard voices telling us that greatness and beauty are eternal , that " one name shall not die , " that neither " marble nor the gilded monuments of princes shall outlastthis powerful rhyme , " that the freshness of a girl 's cheek or an old man 's moral daring will have their immortality " in black ink . " But we know this is only poetry . There is no bridge , so what should be an incessant dialogue becomes a fading monologue as the world burns behind us . As I write now , a tormenting thought drums constantly in my mind : If I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more important than excellence  --  what we in frustration call value  --  in Clem 's work ; I could show you the silences from which it came , so that the silencesin our lives might echo the same measures . I have only fragments to show . After Clem 's death Sheila sent me a packet that contained a few letters of his mailed to her from England and France and a few loose-leaf pages from one of his notebooks . A very brief scrawl accompanied the package : " I was n't altogether thorough . What 's left is n't Our Boy in the Great War , as you 'll see . Of course I want them back . Not so much for myself any more  --  I still gop307blind when I look at them  --  but for Jess and maybe even Lulie someday . They 'll have to make what they can of them , because that 's all there is . Only I 'll tell them I was happy when I got them , however unhappythey may seem . " I HAVE CHOSEN to intrude as little of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the following letters . I would not insist that they are any more of a " war story " than they appear to be . For the hypothetical person who has never read a novel dealing with the Second World War , I had better point out right now that here he will find no re-creation of how it was to be a soldier . The peculiarity of the author certainly overshadows any generalizationabout the quality of circumstance shared by so many and already documented so copiously in books of fiction and fact  --  in Clem 's Angel at Noon among others . At one point it seemed expedient to add a larger factual gloss to the episode with Cecile Potter in England , since that has so much to do with Clem 's play Death and the Devil , but I chose finally to leave this bit of reality to be inferred somewhere between the letters and the final dramatic form . The letters and the Broadway production are both " ways of looking " at something that occurred , and again I would suggest that Clem 's way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any circumstances along the way . Because he was a writer , but only because he was a writer , the experience with Cecile had consequences that integrate it into his life . I have not even taken pains to locate the letters geographically or in time . It is enough to note that Clem went to the European theater and stayed a little more than two years . The voyage depicted by these fragments is rather more like one of Gulliver 's middle voyages than it is like the historic excursions of soldiers . Or it is like the Baudelairean travel where we go " bercant notre in fini sur le fini des mers . " The first two letters were written at sea on the way to England , some nine months after Clem 's induction.  |p308The  riddle again , answered again , riddled again . This time they 've set evidence of ocean around me as if something so big ought to do the convincing trick , but I 'm still not sure the war exists . The fat ship and my fat captain ( officers must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or their warlikeness or not . But something else does . I Am , says the War . And I recommend for strangeness the experience of standing in a gossipy chow line on B deck , inching your way through a slick of puke toward the big kettles , listening the while to Nobadaddy read the war news over the P.A. system , all the while silently arguing . The perpetual argument now goes something like this : I AM : " I pinched that little gullie 's ass so hand she damn near jumped in front of the subaway train at Tom 's Squaih . She was all prepead to take a strong dislikin ' to me or maybe scream . Real cultivatedgull , but shee-it , they all the same . You know that ? You know they all the same ?

With it humming amidst my ears and with the intent of profiting from the languors of the voyage , I took myself up on the port side of Hatch A ( for once not being used as a prayer platform ) with a right hand full of GI stationery and my left clutching my Schaeffer whitedotpen . Flexing salt-air-uncreased O.D.s to place my butt between a sergeant reading Gone with the Wind and Ogilvie writing a nonstop letter ( or prayer ) to his wife , in mid-crouch , my eye noting the pomp of our destroyer escort feathering green waves to starboard , it occurredto me that my true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw at once it was my duty to write to our President , urging him to reconsider the cost of this expedition .

Be consoled that the military do not seem to bother me much for being a poet . I have such wit and bounce that they generally come to think I am a cute little rat , at least . Later : I ca n't finish my elastic poem . Something inside  --  neither heart , mind , nor gut , but more central  --  is still very weak , weak as a new/born baby . There are times when I tell myself that going without sex ( the key archetype of poetic business ) makes it unlikely that I will finish anything , but then I reprimanded myself with the reflections that such impure thoughts are not for one venturing on such an awful mission as I.

While we were on that frigging boat amidst the pomp of destroyers , great guns , and battle wagons , running blacked out , everyone felt like it was the evening before Gettysburg , Waterloo , or Paaschendaele . ( " It is , it is ! the cannon 's opening roar ! " ) Hotspur Anderson was prepared to bundle all the service records , directives and the Captain'shooch ( my special charge ) into a foot locker or burn them and lay wire in the very teeth of advancing Panzers .

I am sore that my splendid image of Ariadne 's thread drawn beyond the breaking point has been demonstrated untrue .

Surely SS Panzerkampfwagen can not prevail againstit'sp313American Love .

We hurl against you  --  Domestic Love . Dragel , Burford , George , Sorel , and I have passes this afternoon and are going to scout for Lady Chatterley . We have heard already many funny stories about English girls . They are supposed to believe that nothing is immoral as long as they remain standing .

Forbidden by absence to press my curly nose against that breast which was the model for the left breast of Helen , I shall nudge it to the window of culture 's candy store . P.S. My old New York buddy Henderson Paul has got a cushy job on Yank , though in the South Pacific area . He is one man who is certainly going to tell the truth about this war , because he certainly knows it . No one will ever shake that boy 's testimony . I suppose I 'll write to him , just to let him know the men with the net did n't get me , as he so freely predicted . He 'll answer , " The game ai n't over yet , Anderson . " He loves to talk in baseball , a language that makes the truth about the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given up my great conceit of " the child " ? I 'd give it up if I could , but it wo n't give me up . I gather from what you say that you still suspect I thought I was the child . Never ! Not the child but a monk of the child am I. It is funny how military service has brought out the monkish in my nature , that adaptability to a strict regimenting of hours in which each day the soul performs its discreet functions . I ought to prepare a book ofp314hours , not to follow , since I follow it anyway without exterior guidance , but as a testament . I have mentioned the Hour of Directive Dreams and the Hour of Bleak Rebellion . Exactly halfway between these ( 10:30-11:30 , otherwise known as Second Piss Call ) there is an Hour of Composition when messages sent from all over the celestial and terrestrial globes coalesce in my pentagonal nerve centers . With coffee and cigarette in hand  --  the Morning Report completed , the Special Orders cut and dispatched , Sergeant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useful dispatches and , each morning , compose the skeleton of at least one poem . ( I never finish anything at this time . It takes weeks for even short poems to finish themselves when , as is still infrequent , they ever do . ) It is the grand strategy that is made then , the mental formation into which I will try to lure the wary , twice-shy stuff at my and its leisure . But as my rectum begins to twitch with the triple creative stimuli ( le fume , le cafe , et l'ordure , as Sainte-Beuve should have put it ) I compose with the authority of G. Catlett Marshall , author of North Africa , Sicily , and other works of the spirit . The nature of my dispatches ? Not all of them can be revealed en clair , but I can tell you that lots of the best of them are censored newspaper stories , which I either unscrambleby the Anderson Method or , more frequently , take straight . One of my major discoveries ( one I was bound to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly what people are being told about it . That is , the effort to lie on the part of correspondents and censors merely traps them into giving a truth beyond their intentions . " I am the wings when me they fly , " said the Real War . For instance , let me tell you that I have become a fan of Henderson Paul 's dispatchesin Yank and have even resumed a sly correspondence with him to tell him how valuable ( I do n't tell him half ! ) I find his on-thespottales from the South Pacific . He did a grand bit on the Kwajaleininvasion . ( Did you see it ? ) Well , there were no stained stones kissed by the American dead in Sergeant Paul 's prose and no Bibles stopping bullets either ! ( One of the main things about the Second World War is that it is not the First World War . ) This war took its inspiration from Stephen Crane and Conrad . ( " There were five men in the rubber boat and none of them knew the color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man in the rubber boat , according to the Paul dispatches and others , is always a black man , but you never find thatp315out until right at the end . The fourth man is always a Jew with a name consisting of two iambs , and the iambs indicate his faith and racial origin at once , while color is still being held in suspension . The third man  --  the caesural pause between Negro and Jew  --  is from the Midwest , ordinarily from a town which he quaintly calls " Dee Moyns . " The fifth man is from Texas or Little Italy , depending on whether a masculine or feminine ending is required . The first man is a coward and a salesman ( probably of rubber goods , though sometimesthis metier is thinly disguised by calling him a tire salesman ) . Now , this undisguisable concern with number , place in series , suspension and synecdoche is clearly the very stuff of poetry and the stuff poetry is best able to re-create , and the only reason Hendersondoes n't write it in verse is he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ( and his dispatches ) like grease soaking up through paper . The basic pattern of numbers on which the war is founded shows with the reliability of certain key combinationsthat appear in the ranting of a spiritualistic medium . ( I 'm sure this is all as apparent to G. C. Marshall as it is to me . He knows that second man is a man of color , knows how to spring the rhythm by omitting him or moving him down to third or fifth . ) The object of my work is to make this substructure of metric number perceptible to everyone , including Paul , if he ever wants to know ; and this requiresthe bit of heightening that formalized verse can give . I 'm dead sold and enthusiastic about using only lignes trouvees ( like " Knock off all games , the smoking lamp is out " ) in classic forms . ( It became part of a villanelle , not a very good one , but that do n't matter . If a man is serious about his work he should not all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) So far the main result of all the great insights that come in the Hour of Composition has not been much poetry I want to show anyone , even you . They ( insights ) are rather often sublimated into my first duty of the afternoon , which is to keep up to date the battle maps in the day room , which I have done in an inspirational manner . One afternoon I created near-panic by moving the flags around in such a way as to show that the Nazis had outflanked us in both theaters by airborne landings in Alexandria , Capetowl , , and Vancouver . In the next three or four days I had restored hope by a series of countermoves that would have left Clausewitz dizzy and had posted orders of the day on the Information Bulletin Board thatp316managed to provoke considerable theorizing from all quarters . The whole company was interested and all went well until we got a visit from the I.G. , who went mad when he saw the board and told me in all seriousness that I had risked the death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rank of private , I " have joined the company of Billy Mitchell , Charles de Gaulle and all such as have paid the price of being ahead of their times . Refusing to be embittered , I sent a letter to Marshall ( copy to Eisenhower ) offering to resume my rank should the adverse situation I have foreseen become a reality . Later ( 2 days , in fact ) : Another probable reason I have finished nothing adequate is my social life , which is now composed pretty much of visits to the Potter family . Brother Gerald Potter picked us up first  --  Ogilvie , Harlan , and I  --  no doubt because we are what his mother somewhat condescendinglycalls " college men , " though her idea of a college in the Midwest is almost literally Mark Hopkins on one end of a log and a student on the other . ( And ' oo , pray , is this ' Opkins ? ) Gerald , limping from a wound he got at Tobruk , found us in a pub one afternoon and asked us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have you know , coasting the last two miles among trees I recognized from fairy tales and illustrations in my fourth-grade reader . I may have recognized the Potters ' house and their way of living from reading E. M. Forster . ( Every restrained gesture says , " Oh , I 'm nothing ; it 's the inner life that counts . " They truly rejoice at any successful raid on the ranks of the benighted . ) But more than likely my sense of de/a vu results from the preparations made by H. Warwick Lloyd . Even the smell of the Potters ' living room had been transplanted , I felt , from that delicate boar 's nest that Warry once established at Emmy Polk 's . He was such a fool that he became an artist . The Potters specialize in a grand view and a vast amount of impeccably polished silver in relation to the pitiful amount of high tea or dinner they can offer . In manners whose chief beauty is their capacity to function in all circumstances . When they found  --  I told them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clung hard to me , though in the course of things Harlan and Ogilvie have moved away in search of livelier fun.  |p317Gerald  and I have a perpetual mock-heroic game that goes oftentimeslike this : ANDERSON : Someday it will be said of the poet , " Anderson never read a single book . " GERALD : Would he had read a thousand ! Mrs. Potter considers me the voice of America , preferable to what she gets on her radio , and though I shake her by such devices as pretending to believe that Grey of Fallodon was ( 1 ) a hunting dog painted by Landseer or ( 2 ) the father of Tarzan of the Apes , she joys to sit with her stick between her knees and debate my jelling ideas of tragedy , which I have told you center in the idea of the child and which I wo n't give up for all her serenity and careful reasoning . " Well , Clement , " she says , " if it is n't the fate of the masses that is tragic and if it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tragic , what is it , then ? " And I , pacing around her parlor , striking the fringe of her chairs with my bloody ashplant , I say , " Man . " " How can we comprehend Man except as the mass or as the individual ? " " We 'd better learn , " I say , with prophecy darkening my brow . I squinch my eyes up very oddly and say , " It is the child , the burning child . " And Mrs. Potter says , " I believe that in America the child is venerated in a way unknown here . " And nods sadly as if we all know something we ca n't tell her , which indeed is true , up to a point . I do know things which I ca n't tell anyone yet until I have distilled a language out of this war that we can all share . I belabor her terribly with incoherences . The more I learn , the harder it is for me to speak so anyone can understand me . And I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " You 're talking nonsense . " At any rate , she and I love each other dearly . You know how I am always finding parents and substituting them for my real ones . That makes me just right for her , since I suppose she is always finding sons  --  besides Gerald , who is so good he ought to be enough for her but does n't seem to be . One night on pass I stayed out at their house , and when a windstorm came up in the night Mrs. P came chargingp318into my room to make sure I was all right . I have never seen such a ravenous maternal glare as hit me from under her curlers , and she retucked my blankets as though I were ten and needed to be soothed about the heavenly pother before she left . There is also in the family a daughter named Cecile  --  very bucktoothed , or with a short upper lip , but also enormous breasts , nice eyes , and hair like Charlotte Bronte 's . She is very quiet while the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minute . It is understood ( by me , too  --  I am not slow to catch on ) that she is Daddy 's girl , though Daddy Potter was killed flying a glider in the German Alps back in the good days of the Weimar Republic . I think it is implied that her quiet stems from the simple circumstance of his absence . There are no complicated psychologicalknots in Cecile . She is the kind of girl of whom it could be said with perfect propriety that her " heart was broken " by this or that circumstance . Her heart is not broken , but the cat has got her tongue . She will never get over her loss , and no one thinks she ought to . A perfect spinster . MONTEZUMALETTER VAPO 927FIT AUDIENCE , I 'm glad you liked " Country Matters " as much as I did . I would n't have sent it , even yet , if I had had any doubts about it . Now I 'm nearly finished with another big poem , probably to be called , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steel-rimmed eyeThat watched it die , Not I.Anderson sings on every bough , in England now .

" Now I know that every pause and abstinence is good for me  --  in love , in work  --  bending a spring that spring will spring . Orp319perhaps the prosperity of my verse reflects the military prosperity of this island . From all my estuaries the fleets muster , and my meadows , too , roar with bombers preparing for the great invasion  --  of Europe , of the public world too long sealed from my commerce by Hitler guns . An indescribable erection of the spirit spreads indescribably from all this impatient military readiness . I sent " Country Matters , " " Festung Europa " and " A Bomber Called Vondalee " to Bentley , who , after all , remembers me . ( This time I did n't need him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm grateful for this circumstance , as I never wanted to approach him except man to man . ) He offers to prod Gordon and Maxwell into doing a book of my things when they have saved enough paper . Cut the forests , there 's a load of verse on the way ! Yes , of course " Country Matters " is " about " the Potters as much as poetry is ever about any specific thing . But if you read it for information you will miss most of it . It is also obviously about Hamlet and Ophelia and how a handsome prince feels about such a mousy commoner , and aboutCLEMStapled to Letter IV was the draft of a poem never , as far as I know , printed anywhere .

It is clear that I have failed to show myself to you ( or , as you prefer to say , " was not honest " )  --  as it was clear from before I shipped that I would not be able to .

So then , in your book , it was all for nothing , like a disease . But I did n't want my mind clarified . I wanted it to work in its own ferocious way . It did n't work to any visible purpose , but at least I knew that its purposes were invisible . And now this . This tangle of misrepresentation and misunderstanding had to happen if we tried to keep our holy communion and communication activated through the imperfect means that they left us  --  all their V Mails , artificial females among letters . Now , when it is too late , it has been demonstrated that I was right when I asked that you and Ip323break clean until this war is over , returning then to each other as we chose to be , not as what they made of us .

Well , then , watch with me . I will tell you the truth on all the points you were reckless enough to charge me with . You asked to " share , " dear Pandora . Then share. 1 . Yes . I do seem to be getting egg in my beer while the poor devils are dying , and I cheer when no one should . And I sport me while you are wasting away sticking to a bargain you do n't understand .

I did not tell you everything about Cecile Potter . If I told you all ( or tried ) you might think that in her I had found the burning child , and I have not found him . But could you stand what I know about her ? Do you know what a stink women are when they lie in the hell at the bottom of their womanhood , unredeemed ? Oh , I do n't think I 'm a redeemer with my little cock , but I can guess what a redeemer would have to be. 3 . Yes . You were very clever to reason out that I had been able to finish a lot of work because I had started sleeping with Cecile . More than that , you guess well that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that night when the storm woke us all and her mother came into the room so motherly fond to tuck us in . ( And is n't that a scene , for you ? Henderson Paul would know exactly what to do with it in one of the puky novels he is undoubtedly preparing to write when his United Nations have won the war . Lady Mother must either be shocked into squawking like a chicken or be a dandy pander whop324has plotted it all . But I do n't know what to make of the scene , because I saw it , and I remember instant flashes so thickly coded with meaningit would take me forever to untangle  --  Cecile 's ugly deformed mouth trying an Ipana smile of confidence from my pillow , and her mother , heartbroken not so much by discovery as by unwarranted hope that her chick was happy , spending in a flash the dignity they 've been hoarding on this island a thousand years to try to make a look of blessing that would shelter the million wrongs she saw in the adjacency of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possession you have a case . What do you want with a " case " ? This goddam life is to live and see , not to be justified in . The facts will not tell you much about the rich and sad relationship I have formed with the Potters , nor what a strange land the ships brought me to , after all . " Country Matters " could tell you more about it , and you crack me near my diamond body when you appear to have read it merely to snoop for information . I am willing to confess what can be confessed , but you wo n't be much wiser , for if the poem does n't tell enough of the truth , I ca n't believe that I can tell it in prose . Once more I 'll say that I ca n't understand how you or everybody wants to think a poem is " just literature , " while any old jabber in prose must be reliable . The actual day on which I based " Country Matters " went like this : Cecile and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bomb damage . It is quite the tour ( I am not the only one who , to your dismay , regards the war as a spectacle staged for his entertainment ) and on the way we fell in with other pilgrims who right merrily traded stories and C rations with us . Among them was a Catholic chaplain who would do for your Pardoner and a good Marine colonel who would do better for your Gentle Perfect Knight than I would do for your Squire . ( Though squire I was , with tender , shortlippedCecile on my arm . ) Not all ( only most ) of what we say about officers is true . The colonel called Cecile my girl , while the chaplain 's pig eyes showed true his thought that such as I could be after only one thing with a girl whose face is so disfigured . Or was she my crip sister ? In the town Cecile and I wandered off by ourselves . The sky ( you 'll need the sky if you 're really going to see this ; sky helpsp325imagine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clouded , but the clouds were high , seeming stretched like a tympanum to make an acoustic chamber in which there was no sound . ( I did not invent the extraordinary silence that I said in the poem emanated from the ragged buildings ; it exists , and the silence literally is their scream , awful spirit ditties of no tone . Anyone who looks at them will , as if automatically , find himself listening , and there is a uniform shock to all who hear nothing . ) What it did to Cecile and me , all this savage desolation  --  so much like the jungle Conrad describes in Heart of Darkness , those great and prophetic passages  --  was to make us hot . I think it was to us as if we were the only survivors , and all the death we knew not how to accommodate with our minds was crying to be celebrated through our genitals . Funeral games . Now , there had been no thought of this when we left home that morning or ever at any time before . Maybe to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handicapped sister ( the bad chaplain in his guesses was only morally wrong ) , my hurt and gentle one that I would take care of the way I had to take care of the stray dog I acquired when I slammed Jack Wagner with a rock . Honestly , it was only in that suggestive rubble that the moral imperative became clear to me , and when it did I felt like someone had hit me with a sledge . I did n't want it . I felt like covering my parts with my helmet . My seed not for this fire-gutted island , I pleaded . But a pocked Venus rose from the craters and mastered me . Hand in hand Cecile and I came to what had been a school building . It was of fairly recent construction , all reinforced concrete , and was practically intact except that some of the windows had been enlarged by the explosions nearby . It was totally emptied . No desks or cupboards or maps or pictures . You know , as if what was to be taught there was Nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bits of Latin and mathematics under the swirls of erasure , overwritten with tourist names like Cpl . Al J. de Vilbiss , 8015 Huntington Road , Pasadena , California . " . . . the broken slate where some schoolboy had written boredom ' and another written hate . ' " We climbed some flights of broad concrete stairs until we came at last to a small enclosed stair leading to the roof . Through a doorless opening we went out to get a bomber 's eye view of the town around.  |p326It  was raining a little , enough to make the concrete roof under our feet slick , and Cecile had the collar of her mac up . Then one of my special states began to happen  --  the kind of preepileptictrance ( I 'm going by Dostoevsky 's descriptions ) that I 've had a couple of times before , once in a silly cornfield , and once when Oom the guru almost succeeded in teaching me to stand on my head . All that I 'd been discerning ' way out at the tip of my imagination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses scream aloud , a real baying and caterwauling , but lower in pitch than you 'd think a scream could be , a sound like surf mixed with the voices of all the drowned men . I thought that empty roof with the ruin all around us was our ark , with no Ararat in sight and no animals in the hold , either , except the tiger and the boar in our respective thighs . Our souls were right tempted then and there to go at it under the rain , though we could not meet each other 's eyes or find anything to say . The brown nightingale , my sister , I took her hand and led her back inside , and after the business with underclothes she said in a piteous , wondrous voice , " If we did , you know I could never let you go . " I said , " I wo n't stay here . " She said  --  and drew away enough to smile that awful smile of hers , so much like a fragrant death 's head  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I would have needed her , too  --  so badly I could n't have helped it  --  if the trance effect had n't been fading so rapidly . But I said that since I was the Strongest Boy in my country I did n't need her . Then all three of us bowed our heads and departed that place of death , nothing having been done  --  and perhaps I am guilty to those dead that nothing there was . All the way home in the train she clung tighter to my hand under the sleeve of her mac , her hand so small and damp , and her eyes loud with that tongue-cut-out pleading for something I could not say . Practical thoughts buzzed about like flies going for the carcass of a dead lust . Did she want a GI husband ? Sentimental love words ? To be told her teeth were pretty and it 's a good thing no lip hid them ? A shilling 's worth of deceit to lubricate her ? Ah , well , maybe only something like that , I thought in great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she wanted much more than any of that . She wanted me  --  as women often do , and that is whyp327they come to me so often in my duty dreams  --  to give her back all she had ever lost , telling her that the Krauts had never come with their ravishing bombs , that nature had never raided her mouth and blasted the decent lip off her teeth , that her bird father was not dead but still went soaring off somewhere on the generous thermals of Europe in his bally glider . By the time the train brought us back from one psychological level to another I knew all she wanted me to say to her , but I could not bring myself to say it . Enough to have borne and known for one day ! But the days of revelation do n't submit to laws of moderation  --  just the opposite . Only when the nerves are strained impossibly come those moments when they are strained more . It 's very much as if emotional strain invented or caused the circumstances that will increase it  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like " automatic writing . " Back at the Potters ' for tea there was company waiting for us , a very old family friend , they said . I knew at once who he was  --  not just his name , though I recognized that from college texts , from hearing Felix Martin speak of him , A. S. J. Gilley , the philologist , but what role he had in that roomful of us friendly , civilized people determined to kill or be killed . He was Cecile 's fiance -- I guess that is the right word , though there are so many complications involved that no one epithet is quite sufficient . A widower for twenty years , a lifelong friend of Cecile 's father , he was assigned to take her as the wife of his old age  --  as I thought , give her spinsterhood a gentle coloration it could not have had without their conspiratorial solicitude . I was , willy-nilly , his rival , you see . ( You do n't see , and the fault is not yours but mine for being real invisibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I could have declined the game , announced firmly that I was not , after all , playing . But I was playing . When someone pitches , I always swing , and had , in any case , earlier in the day , found myself at the wicket , at bat . ) Unbeknownstto your knight , the Potters had been fattening him for just this encounter all along . I was to save the princess from this wonderful , kind old dragon , or yield my bones as dowry for their bloodless marriage . My tactic ( sic ) was to fall in love with the old man the minute I saw that I had to fight him . He is one of those absolutely great menp328that I knew they had in this country securely tucked down in the national life like a garlic clove in a roast of beef instead of stuck up on top for dressing . He has a mind white and soft and supple as girls ' bodies and then under this the firmness that comes from having Latin , Greek , and Hebrew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low-lying , superficially cluttered , and at points proud and high as one of their great universities , sloping down the hill to its easy river but sticking its chapel spires up high and white over the countryside . Well , before the matchmakers said Jack Robinson , I bearded him and very aggressively tried to butt him down by arguing the genius of the American language against all those that he was shepherd of . Typically smart-aleck , I was playing the little barbarian for all it was worth , drinking Scotch instead of tea as if maybe when I got drunk enough I would begin to demonstrate with an Ozark dance or an Orchard Street windmill of gestures what I could not very precisely say . I recited Hart Crane to him , " 0 Braves , we danced beyond our farms , In cobalt deserts , " and said the English would never have spunk enough again to hammer so much into so few words . I have never had so good a listener , one who seemed to hear in the apparentlysimplest combinations  --  my lignes trouvees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I would have served him  --  my right father  --  in the same spirit that Ariel serves Prospero . We 'd have made a dandy team if the stars and all had not set us in this opposition . And then while I was ranting I got the notion  --  felt it all clear  --  that the Potters had not brought us together just so we could fight it out . They wanted me to win , drive him down . They were betting on me  --  yawp , splutter , slobber , drunkenness , beardless militance and all . Gently they hoped that I would down him  --  this wonderful old man  --  because in their bowels the English have lost faith in what he represents . They too want their Hun to free them from the doldrums of compromise . I did not want to have the obligation of killing him for them . I began to feel Hamletish indeed when I realized that it was not I who wanted to do in their Claudius for them . Their I had to strike and my I said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss OpheliaCecilesitting behind me , ready to take my hot head in her lap . All this was not so noisy or scenic , naturally , as I am making it outp329in this telling . I kept trying to outdo old Claudius in courtliness too ( laughable as that seems ) , bowing and scraping and insisting that he made all the points , while he , from his throne , was giving me all the quotes and instances I was gasping for to hold my arguments together , tossing them down with ease as if he knew every word printed since Gutenberg . On all technicalities he knew he had me . I was a foolish mouse in his wise cat hands . But then at last I knew he wanted to be beaten , too , relieved of responsibility of rule . Our crazy battle went on through dinner , after which he went home , walking through the drizzle . He had almost ten miles to go and he is in his sixties and he set out so cheerily . God , I loved him and know him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but they had taken me in by their game and I could not refuse to be in some sense their executioner . ( Which suggested all the new interpretations of Hamlet . Was Claudius ' real guilt in provoking Hamlet to kill him ? Did n't Hamlet love Claudius more than his own provincial father ? No , but these might be wondrous Rilkean variations on the classic theme . ) I had a tremendous headache when he had gone , and my face was burning  --  and it just happened that I was sitting with my head in Cecile 's lap and she was running her hands through my GI hair . I think she said , " You are keen , my lord . " But it does n't matter if she really did or not . I knew that 's what she ought to say . I knew , by that time , what it all meant and how I would write it . But I was n't free to go away and take pencil in hand at that moment . I went on with the game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the edge off me . She and I went on until bedtime playing our parts behind the knowing backs of Gerald and Mrs. Potter , me catching her in the kitchen to kiss her , or in the dark of the stairs and arranging with her how she would come to my room when the others were in bed . I had won her , and I could not just say , " No , thanks . " On the other hand , now that I had been declared winner I was already beginning to wonder why I had competed . I went through with it , all the painful farce , fooling no one , as I discovered when the wind rose and Mrs. Potter came in to see if I ( we ) was ( were ) all tickety-boo and comfy . Lucky Clem , then  --  if you have to be bitter  --  who found not only an amorous nightingale but an approving , pimping top-drawer motherp330to cluck over his luxuries . But you could only say this by refusing to understand me as I understand myself  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being any value to you . The truth is I lay with Cecile and I suffered more from that than I have ever known how to suffer before . It is non dulce et non decorum to discover the object of irresistible pity in an available crotch . All my body hair is singed by the flames I have embraced . It is truly through fire that Phoenix rises . Rose , rather . The proper tense for all this ( as for all truth ) is past . The present is never true , though real . I am not going to the Potters ' any more . I can not save their Cecile or their future or whatever it is they mutely required me to save . I have kicked them out of the lifeboat and am alone again . Gerald seems to know why I fled better than his sister . Cecile and I had a terrible parting . She accused me hypocritically of ruining her " chance for happiness " with Gilley . Though I can see that it might be happiness just to sit in the stilly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " chance " with Gilley is lost only in the sense that she wo n't accept him now , after me . But now that it is lost , she believes in it , though she was skeptical when she could have had it . Now that she has psychologically put him beyond the pale of consideration , she can fancy that he might have been a composite of his own gentleness and my earnest eroticism . Gerald confirms for me that this is hypocrisy on her part , but we conclude together that people ( like her , for all people are like her in this ) believe in their hypocritical wishes as they could never believe in their unavailing honesties . And we conclude that this is very female , admiring it as we do not admire our masculine consistencies , but sadly refusing to countenance it as a fit view of life , for all its radiance . Better the desert than the social lie , says Gerald , lifting me to my feet for flight . Their mother is willing to consider all that happened a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is the best thing for those who muddle through to say . She asked Gerald to tell me that she did not consider I had " played the cad . " I do not think I have , either . A cad could not have caused the pain I did . ( " To play the cad " is a very rich expression , and you must not think I am mocking at Mrs. P when I quote her thus . ) I do n't mock you either , ever , and I can tell you all this because 1.  |p331honestly  think I did not do you wrong in my affair with Cecile . At the breaking point of what language I have , with desperate punning , I will still say that it was a soul I plunged for when I penetrated that long-preserved virginity . A soul and worthy  --  I could not deny it if I wished  --  all my love and more loyalty than I shall ever possess . Perhaps every woman always is and any fornication is as mighty a wrong as Tolstoy said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I could have . 0 monsters , your brother is here . This target of paper , this scapegoat paper , has endured me patientlyall these hours when I have been charging it with my sins . It has purged me well now , and the only question remaining is whether now to send it to you . You know I 'll carry it a while before I drop it on you . But I think it is likely that I will send it . It is not quite to be embroidered with gold thread and worn on your breast to the office parties , but I have this solemn feeling : If you accept it , you must cherish it and keep it safe forever . This scarlet letter has magic in it and it would be very bad luck to destroy it after you had once taken it as our own . ( You would destroy it if you ever thought " it 's not so bad .

It is a terrible story , but if we cling to its terror it may keep us safe . And if you did not know it , I could never put any of my real poems in your hands again . ) MAX M. CULPALETTER VIIAPO 927 DEAR MOMMY , There are no coincidences . It 's just laziness to think there are . Everything has meanings that grow like branches among other branches of meaning from the same tree ( Ygdrasil ) . I have already told you how Gilley 's dying at home on D Day set up such entanglementsof meaning and association I could not doubt my mental storm resembled fairly the great storm of history . It is the same when I grieve about Harry Rinehart , now that I have the news of him . I see a propriety , the propriety . For Harryp332blindness is the ultimate pensioning from a world he always dreaded to look at . Whatever is good in it is all secure in his decent darkness . Into Abraham 's bosom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How can I talk this way ? Because it was you who told me the news . Because gentle Harry wanted me to know what I have just said and therefore chose you for his messenger . How can I anyway ? My God , he 's blind . How can I say anything else ? I 'm not blind and I ca n't always stand what I see until I have remade it into words . At night I say , like a little kid promising his toys under the bed , " Do n't be afraid . I wo n't let this war get you . " The dark shall not have any of mine . I carry everyone in a little nest I made for them up under the safe bones of my head .

Uncle Aaron Across the Big Pond . Or known to the family asSARGEThis is the first of the still existing letters written from France . The " affair at Verdun " was a small fire fight that took place after Clem and two other men in a jeep , trying to catch up with Division Headquarters , caught up instead with a rear guard of German infantry . According to the requirements of military duty , Clem acquitted himselfwell . In an engagement that lasted for about an hour , he managed to discharge several hundred rounds of ammunition from ap333submachine gun . After other members of his platoon had come up and Sergeant Henry Harlan had been wounded , Clem led seven men in an attack on a roadblock held by four Germans .

I should have been full of antimilitary hallelujahs , and pragmaticrejoicing , for it was n't too bad a Xmas as such go . Now that I have been transferred to I and E Information and Education Section of the Xlth Corps  --  D.H. . I am again enjoying the privileges of the gifted goldbrick . This unit is a real cell of writers  --  everyone has a novel or some short stories cooking , not to mention histories , dramas , or inspirational books . There is lots of talk at chow and in the latrine about whether this war will be followed like the last by a bunch of war novels , or whether it is so well documented while in progress that there will be nothing left to say when peace comes . I feel that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in with a bunch of professionalssuch as I never met while I lived in New York before . ( These are nearly all New Yorkers . The term " professional writer " is almost synonymous with New Yorker , as they make clear with anecdote and knowledge of much count as we used to think . Connections , that is the thing , and their favorite tale is how Sherwood Anderson got his publisher to print Faulkner 's first novel in exchange for being excused from reading it in manuscript . ) They halfway condescendtoward poetry , though they consider it good " background " for a writer . It is " learning his craft " so then he can go forward to doing something that does n't require any . In weak moments when I sit in the chimney corner listening to them , I dream of using the fairy-tale trick of the sparrow and the eagle on them  --  that is , learning all their tricks of how to suceed as ap334writer and then , at the top of this flight , launching my little sparrow of excellence to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were an excellent stratagem  --  about like the plans I used to make for starring at football . And the truth is more like that I will end my life as a prairie poet , playing my guitar for women 's clubs while my long hair blows in their faces . Your conjecture that I have been brooding about killing someone oversentimentalizes me , I think , though I have been considerably preoccupied with " my man " and can not ever take the deed lightly . There is some trick screen in my mind like an enlarged photograph of his face as it looked against the snow when we came pussyfooting up . It was a " poor " face , the face of a man I would not have liked nor bought a drink for had the circumstances been otherwise , with a ratty , old-fashioned mustache above the black blood still coming from his mouth . Sallow of complexion , and in life his eyes had evidently been shifty . All of which is mere data . I did n't kill him because I did n't like his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't have a reason . I had unreasons , many of which I have figured out , subsequent to the event , and which justify me at least as well as a reason would . In that peculiar kind of fasting and penance I perform  --  burrowed under seven blankets on the troisieme etage of this yellow house , listening to the blue-green wind off the North Sea and sucking up on a bottle of Calvados I stole coming from St. Maio , I read the ceiling cracks for augury and made a private catalogue of how I had worked all these years killing what would eventually turn out to be a real corpse with a real mustache . Under the bed that smelled like Grandpa 's chewing tobacco , in Grandma 's stocking the leg-shaped Winchester with slotted magazine . Down which , more soldiers than toys , the cartridges dropped like paratroopers in the attack . For targets I preferred tin cans to paper , and among tin cans the flat ovoid with a steel-engraving Prince Albert presenting himself black and gray as a mustache in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and on my left forearm steadied me as I imposed my will across the brown pond where the tadpoles were . Loved the female pucker of bullet holes in tin . I was proud among the poultry for my noise , and in the after/noons , after experience , watching the sky wink its Kraut-blue eyes down through the fearful box elder tree , I began to compose my enemy . Who was eight ( little Otto Kleist ) and I was four when Uncle Cole , from the pure generosity of Sunday afternoon and the bloat of a Sunday dinner tickling his prostate , shot me from the haunted rafters of the barn an Uhlan-helmeted and field-gray pigeon . From my candy-sticky fingers fell the seeds of something else 's blood . Oh , hot little murderer , I trotted past the concrete horse tank with it  --  to hide the foreknown sin among rank weeds . Much of the deed was accomplished that day , and a terrible hand raised across the sun as the angel hid his eyes lamenting what I had become . Over the barn went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our balsa planes searched . Arm them with nails ; put pins in the wingtips  --  who told us that ? My enemy was twelve when I responded to the aggressions of Arthur Graber by dropping a cherry bomb into the car seat beside him . When reprimanded , I urged his racial untrustworthiness and the catfish smell of his mother 's false teeth . " Force is the only argument the Grabers understand . " Followed two years of armistice when I put money in my purse and did not name my enemy 's name until , for my good behavior , I was allowed to buy a Stevens Crackshot from Montgomery Ward . In gray October down from their pride of place in the mulberry tree , three spatsies fell in the first morning of my wrath . Godlike through gunsight ( at last ! ) to watch the Kleistian sparrows fall . In the hieroglyphs of wingfeathers I saw the serrations of those triplanes Richthofen flew . I notched the stock . He was fourteen . When I was a soldier at Boy Scout twelve , the Great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sworls of changeable silk Uncle Jeff in putteeslike collapsible drinking cups or jointed wild onions , with the titty flaps of his pockets erect on cloth like monumental stone , a wooden-spoked Ford wheel almost retouched out behind him and beyond that a squad with a barefaced bass drum and a flag awkwardas washing , under a sky tinted like sour medicine , stood . Besidehim Uncle Mutt with his Jack Dempsey haircut , stretching the tendons of his neck as he learned the art of cold steel . Sometimes the beast pretended to shoot at something high  --  ' way high  --  in the cottonwood tree . No one else could see what was livingp336among those ultimate branches when my pellet went singing through the leaves and sky , Hector , German Hector , take my tiny kiss . In the hour when we are trembling with puberty , guns that would kiss form prayers to broken bone . Kleist was eighteen when Harry Rinehart , Jimmy Wickham and I cornered him in a deserted farmhouse west of Boda . We dug in above the farm , listening for division @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leaped from the steeple of the Baptist church . General Anderson came by  --  tight-lipped , exhausted  --  slant-eying the farm . " Boys , they will not give us a barrage , " he said . " Boys , we are going in now . " Rapid fire until a faint warmth was evident in the Crackshot barrel . " Clem , you broke a window ! " Harry said . " God damn you , this is war , " I said , more truly than I knew . In a zigzag charge we took that farmhouse , shot out all the windows  --  the carnage went on because it had begun  --  and the aerial down from the maple tree . We killed the straggling chickens , too  --  three lonely Barred Rocks , who might have been , for all we knew , spies affecting this harmless appearance , and who , in any case , poked their heads out of the weeds at the wrong time , hasard de la guerre . ( I 'd never have hit Kleist if he 'd had the sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen me knock that aerial down with one shot , he would have stayed out of the Hitler Youth . If he had seen me spin and kill the first Barred Rock with a shot from the hip , he would never have defended that roadblock . After I got body hairs there was always something that had to be avenged . Krauts like Steve Baker would do unspeakable things to Margaret Shea as he walked her home from Christian Endeavor ( broke her brassiere straps ) . Letting the boys at Emory 's drugstoresmell his fingers after a date with Betsy George . We went to the hills to fight for purity . ( Nevertheless we were punished for the attack on the farmhouse . The county sheriff spoke of reform school . I paid my summer earnings to replace the windows and that aerial . My enemy had escaped again , but the match was made . ) Or there was something to kill for killing 's sake . Consider the sweet-eyed squirrels in a dome of November leaves . Little heart tight to the branch , an uncontrollable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shape of the sights and the amorous tickle of the trigger . Instant of meeting , not unlike joy for us two when the slug touches  --  and then the generous anxiety as he drops.  |p337Branch  to branch , holding on to my life with his weakening claws . I , Clem Anderson , Boy Crackshot , commit my mortal body to thy death , little tumbler . Only hold on , hold on , thou , a little longer . Catch one more branch before the ground gets thee . I never thought it was only animals I killed when I killed animals . I played as seriously as they did and therefore , as a child , killed innocently , and now , with Kleist , it was the child in me that killed him innocently . It was play . That alone is what justifies me . The nations play and I play with them , and my luck  --  if I will accept it  --  is that I have been all my life learning the game . I have found out the verbal flaw in saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eton . " Waterloo was the fields of Eton , where the boys of history scrambled . Verdun was the great playing field of Europe with that old horse 's ass Petain makingdumb slogans like a coach at half time . " On ne passera pas . " No serious man would say such a thing seriously , for in real life no one can hold . They are always going by . Only in this ritual fun and games is the enemy thrown back , is there a breakthrough , a victory that you can show on a map or a scoreboard . But  --  ah , there 's the rub !  --  if it was the child in me that killed , it is not the child that knows now . And what in me knows is not so innocent , though what it knows is innocent . Huh ? History always innocent , but our knowledge of it always guilty ? How will I endure this paradox ? We apparently have to , and will have to , live in a world where everyone goes around protesting innocence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Innocent ? Not so , I think . THINELETTER XAPO 927O MY DEAR , We had to do so much , so roughly , to ourselves , you and I , to make ourselves fit for survival through the war . And we have done it now . The war is over except for disintegrating the yellow bastards or whatever they may be doing with that new bomb of theirs . And now it seems to be becoming clear to me that I should have been a conscientiousobjector to the aftermath though not to the war . The warp338seems to have been my health , and I am near a basket case now that it is over . I have become a loathsome talker , preacher , and heckler . I know it . And those  --  not few  --  who liked me when I was halfway between my old silence and this now understandably can not bear to have me around . They used to call me " Open-Throat Anderson " for laughs . Now no one laughs . I ca n't seem to begin a conversation without saying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one wants to start at the beginning but me . So I mutter to myself and write you these letters , open-throated . You must n't understand me , or you would be in the same leaky boat as I , but you must cock your lovely ear and listen . All summer the word " liberation " has been mocking me with its ambiguous double significance . It has been also the liberation of a torrent of snakes against which the war slogans  --  my personal ones for me  --  have given us some mental defense but which now come slithering through the mind . For example : I have just seen again , of all people , Gerald Potter . He was really here , but was really a ghost . He came as part of a civilian team of art experts , looking for stuff the Nazis looted . He had , of course , news of Cecile , whom I " liberated " in my eccentric fashion . I really did liberate her , you know . She was a true sleeping beauty until I woke her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She has now married an American sergeant named Harkness . She is pregnant and is hoping to go soon with Harkness to Nebraska , where he will teach in some cow college . Gilley is perpetuated in this new alliance by the fact that Harkness is a philologist , and I , I suppose , by Harkness ' rank and national origin . I was jolly glad she was married , said I to Gerald , glad that she should have come by however indirect a route to her happiness . Generous Gerald emphasized my unintentional part in this . ( How is he so sure it was unintentional ? ) Delicately he said I had played Pygmalion to his sister Galatea . Then he added with genuine but limited pathos ( the saving trick of the English , to look into the abyss and say , " Not so deep as one would have thought " ) that Galatea had learned to talk and walk tinder my sculpting hand . " When she does , she of course says to Pygmalion what has been in her mind all along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him to make this subtle alteration that impliesshe ditched me  --  and how subtle to pity me genuinely for what never happened ! I wanted ( this is the way I am now ) to break the politeness and sneer ( ? ) shout ( ? ) or howl ( ? ) that I had not wanted her in the conventional sense , for his gentle hypocrisy stole away my private justifications for what I had done by giving me some sort of public ones . I had wanted much of Cecile . I 'd wanted her to say the right thing when I touched her imperfect mouth and gave her speech . I did not want her to say , " I love you . " I wanted her to say , " I love . " How good if Gerald could have persuaded me that this was what she was these days saying to Harkness of Nebraska . And he might have done so adequately if he had not shown me a photograph of the happy couple . He tried to carry it off smoothly , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pocket  --  knowing what I would see that no one should . The disfigured mouth , amounting almost to a harelip over prominentteeth , which is the undisguisable wound Cecile has had to live with all her life , is also  --  Harkness ' mouth . In that feature they could be twins . And twins of what ? After all the anguish and effort , after all , she went and married her own wound , " clinging to what had robbed her . " They will walk this earth looking like twins of misfortune , looking for  --  what ? The limited parodistic , inverted happiness of the incapacitated . This is what I liberated Cecile to , so she could come out of the castle and embrace the dragon that had guarded her  --  tooth clicking on tooth when they kiss , the foetus in her growing everything but a lip to hide behind . From the instant I saw Harkness ' picture the myth by which I understood how my affair had turned out was not Gerald 's comfortableold Englishy fable of Pygmalion making a comely woman capable of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free Andromeda from the rock where she is chained .

LETTER XIAPO 927DARLING , Why I went AWOL is very simple to explain , though I would not tell anyone but you . I stole the jeep and went back to bury Otto Kleist . I know it is practically a year now since I killed him , and it is reasonable to suppose that someone long ago buried him or slung some lime on him . But when I thought it through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buried him , but had left him lying . Particularly I felt guilt when I was offered money for poems including one in which his name is mentioned without permission . " Firefight at Verdun , " later included in Sugar Oboe.  --  D.H.I suppose the alarm had gone out for me before I crossed the borderinto France , and no one knows quite how I got as far as I did . I 'm not sure how I found my way there . It scared the hell out of me not to be able to find him when I got back to where we had left him . Trying to orient myself near Vaubecourt , I took the jeep up to the turn in the road where they first opened up on us and hit Harlan . It was wintry then and golden fall this time . Nothing looked the same . The light fell differently on the houses and walls . I determined to wait until the light changed , in the hope that this would make things more familiar and I could see again how it had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had been before . I stayed on the road there for several hours . A fair number of godly folk went past me , on foot or on bicycles or horse-drawn carts . I wanted to speak to them but literally could not . I remembered thatp341the dead do not know that they have died . So what made me so sure that I was alive ? If any of them had spoken to me , I would have done something sensible like drive the jeep into Paris  --  as long as I had stolen it anyway  --  and try to see Picasso or Gide and talk things over . But no one did . Toward sundown I was in a real sweat . The body was n't there , the battle was n't there and I was feeling ten times as guilty as when I pulled the trigger . I began to have dreams in the jeep , so I got out of it and crossed into the field along the road . The sun was like an eggyolk sac full of blood . I thought I must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going down a draw , guiding myself by some poplars along the road  --  but I had been strong then and I had no strength now . My knees felt like they were jointed to bend both ways . Pretty soon I had to sit down and I had what might as well be called a vision , though I like to keep them separate from hallucinations , which this more probably was . I looked down at my chest and there he was . He was buried in me , like some dirty little gray rat that had half crawled into me and died . Well , the thing to do was get him out . It was plainly an unsanitarysituation . No soldier with a pride in his uniform likes to go around with a dead enemy protruding from his vitals . But I could n't get ahold of him . So what occurred to me to do was to get to Chartres as fast as possible . I do n't know what prompted me , but it was right . Something intervened to save me or I might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovery : Whatever else there is or is not on earth or high heaven and whether there is any God or not or whether this tricky life is real , Chartres exists . And it works ! But what a race I had getting there . I drove all night thinking Kleist was about to hatch down there and the next time I looked I would see , well I wo n't mention who all could have been with him  --  my victims . There I went across those plump hills very early in the morning , humped over the wheel and whipping the horses like the old illustrations of the doctor racing the stork . Something was pretty close behind me . Whoosh . All of a sudden , there it wasp , Chartres , like something growing and not growing , one tower high , one tower shorter , big as a zeppelin , comfortable as a barn , and I could breathe again as I came closer . I left the jeep parked in the square in front of the cathedral andp342started walking around it , feeling it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After a while I went and bought myself a bottle of wine and some bread and came to sit down in the grass in front of it , watching the sun go up the towers . The great thing about this buildingis that it is exactly the right distance from the sun neither too close nor too far , neither too hot nor too cold  --  and there seems to be a sort of endless trickle of light coming down the front . After a while I went in , and the truth of this is that as I walked around I kept wanting to throw myself down and grab hold of the floor or anything fastened to it , but I was too proud . I think I was right not to do so , but it felt terribly lonely to remain on my feet . You know ? Where I belonged was out in front watching it . So I went and sat back down where I 'd been and drank some more . Not a lot . Very slow and in measure . By noon I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this fantasy of having nasty old Otto buried in me was merely a disorder of the nerves=which might or might not pass , but everything was all right whether it did or did n't . There are some circumstances when it seems to matter whether one is crazy or sane and others in which that does n't matter at all . Chartres was n't indifferent to me , nor I tempted by any skepticism to doubt it . We got along wonderfully , that old woman of a cathedral and I , and I had made up my mind to stay there forever . I had all the practical details plotted  --  how I would take a room somewhere in the town within easy walking distance so I could come every day and watch . No doubt presently I would become an expert full of all kinds of the detail that tourists want to know about the measurements and weight of the buttresses , so I could make a living out of that and bring you here to live with me . There is no place else on earth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children  --  where it would be safe for me to have children  --  but here I could give them a good life . Anyway , while it lasted I certainly was n't worried about anything except continuing to sit exactly where I was . But the Frogs , who are a very irreligious race , could not comprehend my peculiar devotions . Some of them must have got ahold of the nearest M.P.s and the first thing I knew I was surrounded by about three jeeploads of them . I think they are still convinced that I was engaged in black-mar/ket activities , since , when they began to question me , I put on the silly smirk you know so well and said , " Black indeed ! " There you are . That is why I have been in the stockade . My trial is coming up Tuesday and in the meantime Lieutenant Chisholm has sprung me , out of friendliness and because I am the only person who can find his way through the labyrinth of files that I , Daedalus , set up in just such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care to predict what I will say at the trial . It would be too much trouble to tell the truth . I may get six months . If I do , you might as well go ahead and marry someone else . It 's too long . Love , CLETTER XIIAPO 927Ariadne , I love you . FRIEDRICHThis V-Mail note was evidently mailed on the day that Clem was taken to the general hospital at Mainz to begin his twelve-week stay in the neuropsychiatric ward . Whether Sheila saved it from the fire because of some special sentiment attaching to it or whether it was spared by accident I can not guess . Its particular interest for me comes from the light it sheds on the element of play-acting in Clem 's life during the war . Later Clem would sometimes insist that he worked up a neurotic collapse in order to avoid trial for stealing the jeep and going AWOL . There seems little doubt , though , that the breakdown was real enough to those who dealt with him diagnosticallyand therapeutically . He was taken to the hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swept the office  --  not one of his normal duties  --  and had begun to eat the sweepings . The first diagnosis was acute schizophrenia , and though this was later modifiedto " neurosis , unclassified , " I am convinced that the onset was extremely severe and accompanied with real hallucinations . Nevertheless , this announcement to Sheila of the onset of his madness is a deliberate imitation of Nietzsche 's note to Cosima Wagner on a roughly parallel occasion . Such a borrowing is obviouslyp344consistent with his lightly playful identification of himself as Pope Clement , Esterhazy and others in these surviving letters . It is of course not evidence that he believed himself to be Nietzsche at any time . I suspect that from the visionary center , watching the helpless alternations of sanity and insanity , the writer in him went on recording images and notions that he could not then master with his practical consciousness . And , malingering or helpless in the grip of mental disease as he may have been , his borrowed announcement remains what he called it later in full health  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , the letter that follows should not be taken as a reliable account of his illness , though it is probably a reliable statement of how it appeared to him as recovery progressed .  --  D.H.LETTER XIIIAPO 718I 'm still in the portable puzzle factory , but due to get out soon  --  unless those who have promised me I would are airy phantoms of my feverself . ( They are n't . I have stuck pins in them and found them awake . ) Now that I am allowed to write you about it and correct the impressionsgiven by the chaplain and those Red Cross girls , the lovely Red Cross girls , I can tell you that they have had a hard time trying to figure me out here . Dr. Gorman Theodore Gorman , a cousin of Maxfield Gorman , the producer of Clem 's play  --  D.H. has by now indicated that he had me spotted for a very sick pigeon when I came in . And either he made a bad diagnosis or I made an incredibly quick recovery . Or there are other possibilities on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fence . He " presented " me to a board of convening psychiatrists the other day as a curious case and advanced the theory that it was really my having a bad cold that brought it all on , as I live normally by " an intense integrative effort " which became impossible when I was weakened by chillum vulgaris , the common cold . I tell you that the atmosphere of the board was that of a slave market , with me up on the dais alongside Gorman , and all the bidders down there eying me carefully . I wanted to show my teeth and flex my tiny biceps , yassuh ! One of my theories is that 1p345did n't waste my time with Oom after all , and that I really have a diamond body in there . Even when I was eating the sweepings from the office floor , it was in there shrugging and asking , " Why not ? " Havingthat question clear  --  achieving an absolute indifference  --  was the margin that saved me . Maybe . Since I 've got my strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all our sessions . He thinks , or suspects , that I know something about the way the mind works that he does n't . This makes him insecure professionally . Also leads him to spend more time with me than with other patients  --  ha ! I 'm earning my luxuries again ; now I see how I could have worked my way through college with something easier than dishwashing . He would certainly like to smell out my tricks ! I tell him straightforwardly that writers are different from other people and take different things seriously at different times . Things are not always most important to us at the time they happen . People who stay with us longest are not necessarily most important and their presence or absence is no clue to their persistence and power in our thoughts . ( Viz. Kleist , viz. you , viz. Uncle Cole , viz. Baudelaire 's Passant . ) When I say such things he gives his head a quick , touching little shake , as if he were trying to shake these septic words out of his ears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that people might be truly , radically different from each other and therefore unpredictable . That man needs predictability the way we ( his patients ) need our deliriums . His need mates ours , and thus his ward of loonies is a mental seraglio , with him the Daddy Sultan who will never know the secrets of his maniacal wives . Granting that he has the advantage of some obvious ( merely mechanical ) skills  --  for example , he obviously knew the right things to inject in my rigid body to make me feel all cuddled and at home the day they brought me in , and the way he 's kept me tranquil with his chats , drugs , diet , and regimen of rest is a mechanical marvel  --  but , granting him that , it is strange how barehanded he has to come into the ring for the final guessing game about the nature of my mind . I have forced him to commit ( in the military sense , as when a division or squadron goes into a chosen position or into a bombing run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joined ) top346the theory that , behind the bad cold , my crisis came from my original error of believing that I had to find a formula that could explain this too big , scattered war . Why did a formula seem necessary to me ? ( He was sniffing for a Catholic taint in my pure , Midwestern mentality , you see . ) Because I was a poet . ( They need formulas worse than the de-vout . ) For my work then ? he asks . It ai n't exactly work , Doctor . It is to be . ( At this point in our usual dialogue he is apt to scribble something in his notebook , poor devil . ) Then ( he 's on the trace now ! see his nose twitch ! ) how did I come to realize that the search for the burning child , the devout plumbing in Cecile , the killing , the impulse to bury , and the race to Chartres were not necessary , and that I did n't need to understand the war any more than the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truth : I stopped being a poet . Now he is sad . I will stop writing ? I cheer him up . That 's not what I said , Doctor . I said I chose in this singular incarnation , avatar , essence , or function of myself not to be . I have buried my staff certain fathoms down . Have set my familiars free . I 'll seek the child no more . ( Gorman has pointed out that the child is a Jungian concept , and since he 's down on Jung for sociopolitical , racial reasons , he 's extra glad I 've given it up , left it , as idea , stillborn . ) I tell him I found it was too late in the world for poets . Ferdinand had already topped Miranda . Antonio had bombed the island and stolen the boat before I could get my gear set up . No future in the trade for the late-born . Still he 's sad . What do I intend to do , what will be my work ( that obsessive concern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and chided him for ) when I go home ? Of course it takes an awfully nice man to consider making poetry as decent labor . But niceness does n't , I believe , make for the truth here . Oh , I say . I 'll write poems , plays , short stories , and novels . I 'll work , all right . But for the poems there will be less and less justificationas time goes on . I 'll copy out what is already there . But the wheels are coasting to a stop . Learning to write poetry was my journeyto this war . The war is over , and I promise never to take my vocationso seriously again.  | " You actually believe you could have prevented this war , sealed it off at least , like a malignancy arrested , unfused it , rendered it harmless , made it into a mere slaughter if you had got there in time ? " ( How his eye glitters as he poses this question . If I were to say , Yes , I could have kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with white magic , he would joyfully throw me back into the deepest oubliette . Irrecoverable goods . ) So I say , No , Doctor . How could I , Clem Anderson , the Strongest Boy in Boda , mens sana in corpore sano , and medalist in the fiftyyarddash , believe anything so prima-facie absurd ? And yet you trifled with these delusions when , as you say , you thought of yourself  --  " styled yourself "  --  a poet ? Illicitly I may have trafficked with the Antiscientist himself . I plead only purity of motive . My inquisitor sayeth , Ward No. 8 is paved with the pelts of those whose motives were , in a moral or wishful sense , unassailable . Mine are now corrupt , sir . I am ready to commence a blameless life . If you think that Dr. Gorman does not talk quite like this , you may be right . Yet I do not think he either is a mere shade . I think he is real , and if he lets me out on time I will accept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world is that it do . Not only does he seem real , he is kindly concerned about saving every ingredient of me except that damned hallucinating poetic one . He urges me to concentrate on writing plays , since  --  who would argue this point by now ?  --  I have " a strong dramatic instinct . " And , as part of the continuing therapy he proposes , he has made a sincere offer to put me in touch with his cousin Maxfield , who was very big in Austria before the Anschluss and who is at this moment biding his time in Ozone Park , waiting for shipments of bullion , furs , and rubber goods from unfrozen Europe that will put him back on his feet . CousinM. is eager to meet " young talent " and sweep again into show biz when the capital arrives . Sometime maybe I will take them up on this . But now I am , I feel strongly and strangely , a novelist . I 've written you before that many of the experiences of the last two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Already there are pages of it accumulatingin my foot locker , pages about Boda and me and Harry Rinehart ( whose name I mean to take in the novel ) and all the girls . What do you think of the title " I Marry Them All " ? Now that I am ripe I can see that I have had a happy marriage to this world , and I want to honor the girls who have helped me . One last comment about Good Doctor G. Poor man , he was horrifiedin his gentleness when he saw a couple of letters I started to write you a few weeks back .

He can not help thinking that it was very wrong to load on you all my bitterness , wildness , irresponsibility , grief , and hatred , as I have . He can not forgive me for torturing you by writing about Cecile . Now that I am a novelist , I agree with him . I can not understand my cruelties either . But  --  oh , believe !  --  then I did . All these years and the pretenses were for something . There were awful things , but if you and I have both survived them , then we have survived our war , and Daddy Gorman preaches that the one that 's over is the only one we had to survive .

Should n't Jannie be pregnant again ? Having children seems so natural to them  --  they did n't have to invent the process as we have had to and will have to . The reason I have been tired so often ( or rested so much , as Emmy Polk used to say ) is that I have had to invent every simple human process  --  out of stubbornness in refusing what was given , I suppose .

Had it so . It has been the best Christmas of my life because : 1 . The others were all lousy. 2 . Its gifts , though measured , were ones I was perfectly able to accept . The trouble with Christmas was always that I believed in the seasonal promises with all my hot little heart and took it hard when they only partially materialized . I was one of those who could never settle for half . But I knew when I walked to breakfast this day , at the still center of the turning army , that the promise of peace would be made good . There was frost in the early sunlight and the muted salt smell of the sea , motionless in air too chill to stir . The green tracks my boots made in the frost on the grass when I crossed to the mess hall . On my left was a row of pines , quite formal and shedding hoarfrost , while the crows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earthy nests into the genial harbor haze . Out there , a ship 's horn fatly bleating , like a bourgeois'sdevotions . Laud we the gods , and from the altar fires of sacrificedEurope the crooked smokes ( black rascals ) ascend . Coffee was exactly coffee to my hungry morning tongue  --  not since I used to visit Grandpa 's at six , seven , and eight has coffee tasted so good to me . My thirty-one teeth were never , I will tell you , more efficient ( I felt like I 'd designed them myself ) than on the sausage , eggs , and toast over which my heart said its thanksgiving , and I repentedthat I had ever bitched about army chow . After the morning miracle , I walked far enough to find one ofp350those good little cobbled streets , walled on either side , that has to veer a bit to come to its inevitable big house . When I saw it , peering over its wall like a belle turned old maid and still thinking she is fine , I began to chuckle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giggled , smirked , tittered , guffawed , snorted or tee-heed . But I think you will like me better now that I am a chuckler , though if it goes on too long I suppose it can become a bore and produce ( chez moi ) unsightly distortions of that abdomen which you have every right to expect perfect . Back in the barracks a man named Kundry had appeared with kindling for the stove next my cot . Fortified all around with cans of beer , candy from the PX , paper and pencil for if I would have marketable memories , cigarettes , a few dirty pictures , I settled back and read Caldwell 's Journeyman from beginning to end . Literature has many functions . Erskine Caldwell is exactly the right author to read on Christmas , and when we have children I will make a ritual of reading him aloud to them .

I have warned them that if they come into town they had better come ashooting . Truly , duck , this Christmas has been my best . Once in the morning when it seemed so beautiful I felt tears in my eyes , but like honey . It is indeed over . Consummatum est . And the void future says , " Come and sin no more . " Ici commencent les lendemains qui chantent . " If after every tempest came such calms "  --  no , that one scares me . All my love , CLEMENTP.S . I have no Christmas present for you  --  beads , fishhooks , yard goods or brass wire , such as you maidens are supposed to yearn for withal .

There are twelve hundred ways to tell the story of my life ; all of them could be true , none of them the same . " First : Borne to the tree . Recognized pine smell  --  how ? Second : Flight into Egypt . Father rode . Mother walked . Resolved to ameliorate this sexual chauvinism by art . Conceived a painting of Mother riding , Father walking , carrying me . Poet in his swaddling bands enforced peace on world . Armistice in my stocking . Third : Went to the tree unchanged , swag still in my diaper . Mother gave me my First Anxiety . Father had built barn out of orange crate , detachable sides . Papier-mache animals , color and textureof oatmeal inside the enamel , as revealed when broken . CousinMark broke horse and farmer . Excess of cousins . Poet uncomfortedby parental excuse that damage was unintentional . Cousin Mark 's fault @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fourth : To Grandmother Clement 's . Ford bucking in blue-orange snowdrift beside house . Inside , smell of sickness . Erysipelas ( mythologicalGreek daimon unaccountably hostile to poet and vice versa ) . Insistent recapture of past of the grandfathers with sugar cookies and apple cakes , the best memorial is on the tongue . Poet had expectedold lady to go for trike . Defrauded . Got cheap-looking large mesh red stocking instead , full of inoperative toys , walnuts and tin kazoo . Thorstein Veblen shed his first tears into poet 's life . Whipped for breaking Sister 's bisque doll . Intentional , of course , but how could they know ? Fifth : Sled . Supposed to be boy 's dream . Detested being forced into two overalls and six sweaters and exposed on top of hill in park . Rude cries of older boys . Father , too , felt poet was sissy but refused to act consistently on this sentiment . Expected happened . Knees and mittens wet , soppy . Tears frozen on cheeks . Face burned by scrapingsnow.  |p352Sixth  : Poet disgraced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morn . Presents offered as injunction not to repeat . Grandfather Clement 's jackknife , honed thin while he lived . Poet 's first act was to cut index finger to bone . Accused of carelessness by non-Freudian family . Knife put away until poet was " old enough . " Broke Sister 's piano , because it was cash purchase while knife was not . Seventh : Entire family , including cousins , chipped in to buy poet violin because he was thought talented . ( ? ? ? Piercing treble in school singing ? Tapping foot while listening to crystal-set earphones ? ? Renderingsfrom The Magic Flute on his kazoo ? ? ? Poet had seen no evidence of talent , but they said so . ) Poet immediately learned to producesound like fire siren by caressing E string . Broke bow by striking at Sister . Bought Mother framed poem from dime store , " Only Mother in World . " Touched her . Showed poet crudely cast pig-metal doll chair , claimed it was only store-bought gift she ever got as a child . Poet stood beside her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past , wanted her to be child again so she could have his goddam violin . Later , felt disturbed by excesses of sentimentality and struck Sister with sugar bowl . Violin put up until poet was " old enough . " Eighth : Bought Father and Mother subscription to Collier 's . Poet had come under spell of Sax Rohmer , featured in that magazine . Bought Sister six-note xylophone . Tried to teach her " Taps . " Enragedby her lack of talent and threw xylophone into garbage pail . Mother ruined it by washing under tap . Poet given brown corduroy knickers with special pouch on leg . Inside  --  Grandpa Clement 's knife , blood of the poet still evident under the folded blades . Also gloves with fringe and star on cuffs . During afternoon stood on the porch with gloves , shouting to Major Reno to commit his troops now or never as the damned Sioux had surrounded us . No help came . Poet attacked by neighborhood ruffians hurling snowballs and crying " Sissy . " Even imitation of General Custer considered effeminate by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who said Custer would have been a better general if he had known when to retreat . Ideology of compromise little consolation to poet . Ninth : First Christmas in Milford . Move to Milford made under a running fire of talk about giving poet nicer friends . Smaller town thought to conduce to hitherto questionable manliness and health.  |p353But  poet was sick for three weeks over Christmas . Carried to tree by father , promptly vomited on blue-figured rug . Sister vomited sympathetically . Received red-bound volume of Boy Mechanic , bought by mail from Sears , Roebuck . Later , lying in cocoon of fever heat and soprano smell of bile , heard parents discussing whether book was " too old " for poet . They implied lack of manual dexterity and recalled inability to construct simple kite . Poet hysterically grasped book between his legs under the covers . Determined to hold something against dissynchronization with time . Tenth : Another , bigger sled . Eleventh : Bought framed poem for Vonnie Searles , " Only Girl in World . " Vonnie touched and touched poet in return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Could she have known ? Christmas gifts received : Books , Wonder of the War in the Air , Tarzan and the Jewels of Opar ( already read ) , and Boy Scout Handbook ; my own subscription to Collier 's as Nayland Smith was already engaged in new adventure with Fu Manchu . Reproduction of painting " We "  --  with Lindbergh 's ship high up in enormous clouds . All-steel savings bank . Twelfth : First Christmas in Boda . No signs of manliness at Milford recollected by poet except self-defense with ball bat against Vonnie Searles 's brother , after poet had falsely boasted in boys ' toilet of intimacy with the sister . Boda was " real country "  --  no more than five hundred souls . In exchange of Christmas presents at school , poet gave Betty Otis small figurine in soap . Otis burst into tears at unwrapping . Claimed imputation against her personal hygiene . Poet snickered , though he had been unaware of the allusion until Otis found it . Father convinced that talk of Depression was merely " Democrat lies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bought poet bicycle and sister a fifteen-dollar dollhouse , both Sears , Roebuck . At Christmas dinner quarreled with Uncle Cole and accused him of being a " wet " for insisting that times were getting hard . Poet rode new bicycle into countryside on Christmas afternoon . So moved by snowy grandeur , efficiency of bike , and confidence in future of our economy , he dismounted in woods near Bethel church and masturbated on elm tree . On moss , indicating to any Boy Scout north . Afterward , hypocritical nostalgia for friends left behind in Milford and pangs of guilt for " unfaithfulness " to Vonnie Searles.  |p354Thirteenth  : Whole family shadowed by Father 's melancholia , deepened by the Christmas season . Impression that Father particularlyregretted having sold poet 's bike to son of banker in nearby Murdoch . Reasoned that since bank had folded , banker ought to be as impoverished as we . Once had seen banker 's son on poet 's machine and had tried to run him down with Chevy . Had recently spent entire cold morning with razor in outdoor privy while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begged him to come out . Poet given model airplane , all balsa construction , Sears , Roebuck , $1.14 , plus candy and nuts . After breakfast poet and sister went to pasture below Baptist church to fly plane . Poor thing lurched and leaped over frozen cow tracks , would not leave earth . Attempt at hand launchingsplintered right wing . Sister more disappointed of two , but poet boxed her ears nevertheless . On way home encountered Father . He had been watching from behind Olsen 's cave and did not accept lie that plane had flown " keen . " Snatched it from poet 's hand and ran back to the house with it . Claimed later he was going to return it to Sears and Roebuck and demand a refund from lying Jews who advertisedit as " capable of six-hundred-foot flights . " Later in the day poet took jelly sandwiches and walked out into the country with Harry Rinehart . Harry extremely bitter over fraud of Christmas . Insisted he had never been happy on that day and it first occurred to poet that neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like it so your damned parents wo n't be disappointed . " Poet had intimations of manliness from Harry 's philosophic example . Marveled over paradoxof being able to repeat annually disillusioning experiences with fervor of illusion . Sensed the magnitude , terror , and dignity of humancondition . Remembered the previous Christmas and resolved to stop childish habit of masturbation , often accelerated by high feeling of this and patriotic holidays . Called self stoic . Fourteenth : Stole two-dollar compact for Margaret Shea . Touched penis with powder puff before gift-wrapping . After school had resumedin January , poet was driven wild with guilt when disfiguring acne broke out on virgin 's face . Consulted family Doctor Book . Transmission by such means apparently unrecorded in medical literature , but perhaps poet 's whole life an exception ?  |p355Fifteenth  : Built walnut gun rack in manual training for Father and family at large . Promised Father a double-barreled gun for next Christmas . Sixteenth : Aunt Velma with us since Uncle Cole 's suicide . Disgustingritual of complaint that she ca n't eat , then stuffing herself , Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Et in areadiaego . Later in the day more relatives in the house . Poet expected to recite for them . Instead took his football and headed across pasturetoward Harry Rinehart 's . Saw Irene Lacey heading out of town along the railroad tracks . Followed her at a discreet distance and saw her meet Jack Wagner . Spent the remainder of disgusted afternoonpracticing forward passes into a railway culvert , alone . Seventeenth : Drove to Moorhead to a movie with Margaret Shea on lap . Tried to feel her under the robe . " Later , " she whispered . All the way back the same . Alone on sofa in virgin 's front room she said she knew all about poet 's troubles with Irene Lacey and henceforwardwould not even permit him kisses . Poet accused her of savingthis ultimatum until Christmas , went out banging door when she admitted it . Eighteenth : ( College . ) Worked the holy day at the Hamilton Hotel , bussing dishes besides regular job as dishwasher . Presents from H. Warwick Lloyd : a bottle of muscatel and leather-bound copy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country with bottle , sat in the snow on a hill overlooking lake and got drunk , alone . Thoughts reflexive to thirteenth Christmas . Time unrollingfrom its starry spindle , rerolling . Later returned to campus and lay down in the street in front of Chisman Hall . Puked on ice , constellations of vomit . Vague hopes of achieving poetic fame the ready and easy way a la Chatterton if truck came by . None came , Poet caught cold from indiscretion . Nineteenth : Worked all day at Hamilton Hotel . Under terrific pressure to come home because of Father 's illness . Poet braced himself against such appeals by recalling examples of decadents . Would Rimbaud have come home from Africa , Gauguin from Tahiti , Wilde from Paris because of parent 's strangulated hernia ? Spent afternoon in art building posing for Morrie Solomon . Result to be milestone in two arts , like Stein by Picasso . Solomon flattered poet by remarking he had face of man of sorrows , though frivolous hair . Twentieth : Successful writer , poet remembered how Machiavellip356spoke of bathing , putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at last , approaching his true mistress  --  writing . Alone at Emmy Polk 's , poet attempted this formula on Christmas Day . After bath and dressing felt it silly not to go somewhere . Walked past Sheila 's sorority house , remembers sundown through black elms , snow , and the decent sparrows . Locked house seemed intact with secrets , as if girls had not gone home but had retired to essential chamber no larger than head of a pin to be female in ways poet would never know : Tormented by excessive imagination , poet fantasied orgies involving himself and entire sorority . Planned to stay all night by stealth in Sheila 's room in order to find out what girls did in early morning . Driven away from premises by watchman , later followed by police car . Twenty-first : Took Sheila home to Boda . Everything too reflexive . Poet felt essential hostility between woman and art , competitorsin perpetuation . S. wanted to make love in basement of Baptist church , to " have " poet 's first sex experience . Poet 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in relation to church . Poet 's relation to family passed breaking point . Poet felt fraud for pretending not to notice Father 's bad table manners . Twenty-second : ( New York . ) Lillian Esterman , Henderson Paul and poet went to Brooklyn to visit Schoenbergs , German refugees . Poet sided with Schoenberg brothers in predicting Hitler victory . Inventedand cited many statistics on German steel production , aircraftcarburetors , bombsights , range of artillery , average training period of Stuka pilots , etc . Most of these statistics confirmed by Kurt Schoenberg , to Lillian 's rage . She condemned poet as irresponsible . True enough . On subway going home Lillian denounced poet 's theories of chastity and vegetarianism as " psychotic . " She bought big steaks and cooked them in apartment in effort to demonstrate poet 's fallibility . Poet ate lentil soup . After Henderson and Lillian bedded together , poet drove fist through kitchen window in remorse for dishonesty at Schoenbergs ' . Twenty-third : ( Washington . ) Faithful attempt with Sheila to reconstructpersonal Christmas and unite in spirit with ordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Green Knight , O. Henry , and Charles Dickens . Gifts to street-corner Santa Claus and elevator man . Careful selection of gifts for each other and families . Attended midnight mass . Long walk Christmas afternoon through Georgetown streets and to Lincoln Memorial . Poet lachry/mose over imagining Christmas in Army of the Potomac . Wrapped Sheila in coat and watched bombing planes heading south . Twenty-fourth : ( Camp Joseph T. Robinson , Arkansas . ) Afternoonat the USO writing letters . Later , mixup with M.P.s who hit poet across face with thongs on billies . Poet taken to provost marshal 's office at camp , where M.P.s were rebuked by major for treating poet like a nigger . Poet insisted he was nigger and was sent to hospital for psychiatric observation . There offered position on enlisted staff and asked to stay . Politely refused . Twenty-fifth : ( Oxford , England . ) Christmas dinner with Potters . Poet careful to show he loved each member of Potter family equally . Cultivated Shavian dryness of manner for Mama P. Uttered barbaric yawps for Gerald and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Stalin . Gossiped about the royal family with Cecile . Played " Red River Valley " and other hillbilly songs on harmonica after dinner . Poet extremely touched by their gift of manuscript poem by Sassoon ( though not impressed by poem ) . Twenty-sixth : ( Orleans . ) Bad letters from both Cecile and Sheila arriving the same day . Poet depressed but refusing to admit guilt . At worst claimed military license and indoctrination in spirit of " if you ca n't fuck it or eat it , piss on it . " At best insisted that apparently deep dishonor of acts would accrue " far-off interest of tears . " Remindedself that first duty of soldier poet is to stay alive . Nevertheless in afternoon of Great Day rode with waist gunner of B-24 on a mission to Liege . Purifying cold . Land beneath tempting as candy in moist light . In evening composed verse describing how Me-109 had killed him on mission just flown . Santa in a B-24 . Down your chimneys , Liege ! Twenty-seventh : Here . I LIKED CLEM 'S @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or without being prepared not to , I suppose , enjoying that neutrality of feelings that we bring to new experience after the exhaustion of wrestling with the dilemmas inherent in the old.  |p358I  had slept most of the day after my walk with Sheila . ( M.L.A. meetings were in progress somewhere . Someone supposed I should have been attending them , and I would have gone to them , too , cool and interested , disjunctive as we all must be to survive , if I had had the physical strength . ) It was just seven when I rang the Anderson bell on the seventh floor of a building in the east Eighties . A pretty gray eye appeared momentarily in the brass-ringed peephole of the door . I liked it . With a swoop and a swish of her skirts Cinderella Susan swung the door open and , exclaiming , " Dick ! " came lightly into my arms . I hugged her discreetly as if she were verily my old friend 's wife , pressed my cheek ritually to hers , enjoyed her perfume and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their front room . What eye would not delight in following her ? It simply seemed she had n't much to do with the burning riddle I had watched glow like a sign in the dark sky while Sheila and I walked toward Canal Street the night before . It seemed that this lively body , displacing air and reflecting light , had n't much to do with the teasing photographs and the commands to love in the magazines that had given me prior acquaintance with her . " Clem 's been fighting a hangover all day , " she said in that tone of intimacy that assumed , quite rightly , both of us knew from of old just what part hangovers played in his life . " Poor old boy . I offered him a martini when I got up at three . He said , No , by God , he was going to fight it out in the clean and healthy way until you got here . " " Tell him the reprieve has come , " I said . " Oh , he 'll have heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chuckled , half to herself . " He 's lying in there brooding about his enemies . It does him good to have someone to hate . " " He 's got new ones ? " " Oh . . . " If there were real troubles , she shook them off like water drops from her pellucid shoulders . As she fixed me a drink , continuing to delight my eye with every movement and glad of it ( as she had a right to be ) , I began to see her in the setting that Clem 's prosperity had given her . The apartmenthad an air of loftiness and homely spaciousness  --  not of luxury , but that nice thing , the democratic grace of the well-off to which our taste inclines so readily . There were a few good paintings on the wall , and wholesome spreads of bookcases . There were corn/fortable easy chairs that seemed to have been placed by need and love in the ample dimensions of the room . It was a home where good children would have grown up well , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to some aging and probably happy professor ( probably in Classics ) at Columbia or N.Y.U.And so it did , Susan explained . Of course it was only theirs for ten months . It belonged to a man named Larenson who was in Germanythis year on a sabbatical . Nevertheless , the excellent touch that set off all the apartment 's rather old-fashioned fineness was this year 's Christmas tree . Its branches had been stripped of needles so that they had a kind of clipped-poodle smartness . It was a big tree , and on the splendid , phallic upcurve of nearly every branch there were varied clusters of real fruit  --  plums , tangerines , lemons and a few small , wondrously polished apples . A foot above the tree , suspended on a wire from the ceiling , was a white capital of angels , very discreetly touched with gold . " Yours ? " I asked Susan ( not quite sure whether I meant the angel might be her sister  --  as in smartness it truly was  --  or her creation ) . She nodded , flushing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a kinda knack for these things . I mean it is n't an idea I found in a woman 's magazine or anything like that . " Under the tree there was still an excessive pile of presents , mostly unwrapped , though many still lay in their nest of wrappings , as if Christmas had been too much to use up in a single day . " Clem says The New Yorker laid those while we were asleep . " Susan laughed . " It 's certainly a storm , is n't it ? " I saw a fine double-barreled sixteengauge , and a Deerslayer jacket with many pockets that seemed crazily , wonderfully appropriate to Clem 's new fatness . " God 's plenty , " I said of it all as Susan put a clear , sweating martini in my hand . " What 's left is mostly Clem 's , " she said , " though we had several things for the kids , too . Clem and I had so much fun shopping for Jess and Lulie . He 's so great in a toy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a long , flat package  --  " there is something for Dick and family . Here . " She put it in my hands and , sweeping her skirts up like butterfly wings on either side of her , dropped through their upward motion into the chair opposite me , sighing . " It was sop360hard to get Clem started . He makes an issue of hating Christmas , and then he enjoys it so much . " " We know he 's just pretending , " I said . I busily opened the packagewith our gift . As the cardboard slide came out of its sheath there slithered across my lap a great , flat ceramic platter with a stylized design of a fish on it . " Wonderful , " I said . With my forefinger I chose several spots of glaze or texture to admire . It seemed to me exactly the sort of thing Janet or Jill would choose for our house . How could Susan have known so well ? Because our tastes are so interchangeable ? And if tastes , why not everything else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better than that which did not resemble it , and if the person who preferred a Picasso-type designhad better taste than one whose taste was for realistic fish on a platter , wherein did it follow that love should not seek through resemblancesof the best that ideal of which it is the earthly echo and scorn the singular individual ? From the platter I looked up at Susan and saw the reproduction of a woman finer than any I had met in real life , then saw her as the reproducible girl , as much a feature of the explosion in population as this platter was a feature of industrial technology , nobly made and only a digit . If there are two million more girls in their twenties than there were in 1939 , are they people , The People ? Howso may one love them and howso not ? I saw that I was hardly strong enough , after the night before , to drink as much as I would have liked on this pleasant occasion . Now she spoke in passing of a movie  --  or was it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and my ear sifted it out of our chaff of dialogueas the exact label for herself . If she was not veritably my old friend , she was very , very much like one  --  and was n't resemblance enough for the requirements of one evening ? I assumed that she had stayed at the party last night as long as Clem , and I would not have been surprised to learn that she had drunk nearly as much as he . But there was no sign that last night  --  or any of the past at all  --  had touched her . If she was only acting out freshness , still acting seemed by itself to refresh her . I sensed that she knew I had caught her acting , and she even made being caught at it into part of her success . We were getting along beautifully when Clem came into the room . He had on a red satin dressing gown , exactly as grotesque as some of the costumes he used to assemble in college , though considerablyp361more expensive . He seemed to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if he were slipping across a corner while that featureless , pompous dressing gown marched straight toward us , as if he were the object and not the subject of hangover distortions . An Anderson trick if I ever saw one , a winning one . As he bent over to kiss Susan it occurred to me that , after all , there was some kind of inevitability and propriety in his mating with an actress . He said to her , " Let 's make it a rule , chum , we flush the stool when we 've got company in the house . " Poetically , dramatically calculated  --  oh yes , his first words had that merit . Somewhere between thinking I ought to hit him or stomp out and realizing I was not the person who could do that  --  and wondering , Why take offense at this after so much that might be held against him ?  --  I realized I would have to grant him credit for saying a great deal with terrible succinctness . He was making it clear to both of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were only illusions . He wanted me to see , even in Susan 's reaction to his smashing cruelty , that she was not a fond little girl like my Jill who could be hurt badly by an unexpected rebuff . And in fact the blow seemed not to register on her , as his expression of patient weariness asked me to note . I was , to some small degree , his past and she was his future . He had paid a monstrous price to go over from one to the other , and he was not going to let the price be undercut by easy , ignorant familiarities . In sum , before any of us could think of the right thing to say next ( and what is the proper sequitur to that one , Mrs. Post ? ) I had such an intimation of his pride and despair as never before or since . He had brought his smell of sulphur into the room ; once we had acknowledged it we could play . He said , easily enough , " I 'm sorry you missed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dick . It was apotheotic . You 've never seen me dance like a dancing bear among the pale virgins of Broadway . " Susan was watching his mouth , absolutely rapt , like an eager child waiting her cue to laugh , or like a child enchanted by the fingers of a clarinetist performing with magic nimbleness . Now I knew she had forgotten all about me when he came in . Would remember me again when he permitted her to . Would re-create the scene . Would make us all easy to love . But when the scene was uncreated , there was n't much in their house . " I suspect you were amply appreciated without me , " I said top362Clem . He nodded in the melancholic manner of one acknowledging a hit , a very palpable hit , bent all his attention to his martini , talked to it a while , stared at the wall above my head . " No upper limit to appreciation , " he said . " My good wife , my dear wife often tells me ... " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . that I am beyond criticism , but while that kind of appreciationtastes good , it does n't stick to the ribs . If I had a big enough spoon . . . Give me a spoon long enough and a place to stand and I will eat the world . " " When you sup with the Devil ! " Susan corrected . " It 's when you sup with the Devil you need a long spoon . " He was easier with her now , after a martini and a half . Indulgentlyhe raised his eyebrows and pretended reproof . " You 've told Dick that Gorman was coming . " " He 's not  --  " " No . He 's not , " Clem said , " a devil . It would be the devil theory of history to say so . And according to Aristotle the Devil is not in history , but rather is that final cause toward which all things tend . Is n't that what Aristotle said , Dick ? " Susan laughed . She loved nonsense . " No , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  against the entertaining drift of mockery . Again I feel that , as when I reported my talk with Sheila , I must characterize rather than reproduce the conversation . For the words actually exchanged bore so little discernible connection to their referents that a transcript of them would truly seem to be about nothing . Clem 's wit  --  his toying with hyperbole and parody  --  seemed to run for its own sake , responsible to nothing but the effect it produced , and though it might be found entertaining , whatever virtue it possessed as entertainment would obscure its intended significance . The very tone of irresponsibility was an address to my conscience , a dare to listen  --  and not because my conscience was so fine or awesometo Clem , but , rather , because it was an instrument through which he could still carry on his abstract dialogue with Sheila . ( Is there anything so mysterious about this ? We have simple machinesinto which we may speak , simple machinery for recording the written word . Once recorded , the message may be directly transmitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is intended . Or it mayp363be indefinitely stored . Two books which speak to and reply to each other metaphorically speaking may be shelved on the same library shelf , and , in a metaphor which I have not found to be beyond the comprehension of an average college freshman , we say that these books represent a dialogue . There is no mystery as long as we representthe instrumentality of this dialogue in mechanical terms of books on a shelf , or of recorded tapes ; why should there be a mystery if I say that a dialogue took place through the medium of my conscience ? Such modesty as I have does not incline me to think my conscience less subtle than the communication machinery of our time . ) Nor can I believe Clem so unsubtle as to believe that what we said that night was hors serie , that it did not represent qualifications of a major sort , morally speaking , on ideas already stated in his passionatedialogue with the world  --  though the surface of his talk suggested that this evening had no antecedents beyond last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There had been no episode in a stalled elevator to highlight this carnival , but I think he wanted me to have the impression that , had there been , Susan 's presence would not have deterred him from mentioning it for laughs . There had been a couple of depraved blond twins at the gathering  --  " with Veronica Lake hairdos " which covered the left eye of one and the right eye of the other  --  and only decrepit age plus the geometric principle that states a body can not be in two places at the same time , plus a macabre fascination in Gorman 's maneuvering , had kept him from a " novel experience . " Susan laughed at his droll telling and so did I. What did we hear ? For my benefit , he sketched the recent production history of Death and the Devil . As I knew , the play had been " written , if that 's still a term that means anything , " nearly five years before . It had been " accepted , which is a term that means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . Acceptance had meant that Gormantried to sell the script to a couple of Hollywood actors whose names would carry it at the box office . Gorman meant to sell it to them on its merits ( " lots of poetry in it " ) and on the strength of many promises that financial backers were eager to invest , promises that would materialize if the Hollywood names were brought in , but not otherwise . The first revisions in the script were made to " reweight " the part of the man who was to star as the male lead  --  onp364Gorman 's promise to Clem that as soon as the contracts were signed they would reinstate the original text . One of the stars signed ; the other got a juicy part in a movie to be filmed in Italy , so one of the principal backers withdrew . The original text was  --  mostly  --  restored . Only Gorman 's faith ( Clem 's word , used with no more irony than was implicit in the situation he was describing ) had kept Clem from offering the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grocery store they had rented on East Third Street . " The Kents had introduced him to Joan Marian , who " had the great merit of understanding that Diana was physically ugly " ( Diana , the character who originated as Cecile Potter ) . Joan had thereafter stuck with the play through thick and thin " until Gorman heard the voice of God telling him to take her to the land of Moriah and make a burnt offering of her . " It was Joan 's success in another " sleeper " ( it ran a year and a half on Broadway ) that had enabled Gorman at last to pin together a fabric of backers and stars adequate to make a start on production . Joan had still wanted to play Diana . She had wanted to play it so much that she passed up an offer that would have brought her much more money immediately than she could probably anticipate from Clem 's play . After rehearsals and the tryouts in Washington a year ago  --  when major revisions were made in the action and characters  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not ( or did not ) shift her playing to meet the requirements of the altered script . She had not gone along with the team  --  as all the Washington reviewers agreed . if one could put his finger on any one reason why the backers had welshed last spring and let the play shoal up in a Second Avenue theater instead of opening on Broadway , that reason was Joan 's inadaptibility . The New York reviews had agreed with those in Washington , and though they had been generally very favorable , the finger had to be put on someone before the backers would unwelsh enough to try a Broadway opening this past fall . So Joan had been replaced . Everyone hoped Joan 's career had not been really damaged by the time she wasted on Death , by the bad notices she got . " It was all awful , " Susan said with a pretty shudder . She turned firmly toward Clem and said , " We 're never going to compromise again ! " And the way he returned her bright , fervid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bless you , my dear , for inability to understand that I have not been describing compromises , but participation in evil ! Certainly the story of the burnt offering made of Joan had a thematic parallel  --  almost an identity of form  --  to the larger story of the sacrifice of Sheila . Almost certainly that 's why he had told it to me . ( And wanted me to note that he was talking over Susan 's head with his sly parables ? I ca n't doubt it . ) " No , we 'll never compromise again , " he said . " We wo n't have to . We have money enough now so we wo n't have to . " Uncomfortably I asked what had happened to the play in all these expedient shifts . Beginning as if he had misunderstood the point of my question , he said , " Oh , the play . It 's closing . That 's what the party was for last night . Partly . Gorman has been to Mount Moriah so often that he 's reduced it to a science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relaxation to give God the chance to tell him either that he is not Abraham or that he does n't have to use the knife on Isaac . That word has never come , but he still gives God his chance . " " You mean Gorman sold you  --  " I started to ask . But Susan broke in , a little more angrily than I had expected , to say that he must n't talk that way about Gorman . It was n't true . Closingthe play had become inevitable , a conclusion that anyone who understood arithmetic or dollars and cents would have to arrive at if he was reasonable . Out of common decency Clem ought to be grateful to Gorman for taking care of him when the debacle came . Clem said , " Yes . You 're right . It was ever in Gorman 's thought that I should be so positioned that I would never have to compromise again , and he has fixed it so . My part of the transaction is that we 've sold Death to the movies . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showcase for the final purchase . " " You sold death to the movies ? " My intonation made both of them laugh . I was holding my own in adapting to the tones and modes of this conversation . I said , " You mean Baby Death , the famous child star that sucks her nurse asleep ? " " I hope she keeps them awake , " Susan said . We put a long spoon in the martini pitcher , stirred and  --  stillwaitedfor Gorman . Baby Death , I learned , was going to keep the new air-rooted Andersonsawake to what Susan called " the big life " as long as a hun/dred and fifty thousand dollars ( processed and reprocessed by tax lawyers and internal-revenue agents ) could be spaced out to provide an income of ten thousand a year . This jovial ( Zeusial ? ) shower of gold meant annuities ( futures ! ) for Jess and Lulie . ( " And a decent alimony , " said decent Susan , staring bravely into my eyes . Apparently Sheila , like everyone else involved , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel !  --  for these poor pilgrims who had hardly ever done anything else . It meant , in case Clem should require freedom to write more poetry or another novel , immunity to the slings and arrows of outrageous editors . ( " In case , " Susan said . Clem gave no indicationas to whether he was pregnant with such case . ) It meant no more cheesecake shots of Susan . ( " Those grisly skin pictures , " she said , trembling her shoulderblades as if she were shedding the skin of corruption . It was easy to believe she could do just that . As Clem had said of her when we talked last time before , she had come through unscathed  --  poor child , what plastic surgery of the spirit was required to make her so immaculate within ? ) If she took a part again , she would do it on her own terms . And the present transcendenceof earthly claims on her pelt seemed to mean that motherhoodwas now " definitely not ruled out . " ( I was not sure of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceive , but we seemed to be in agreement that posing with a rapier between her legs was , for a girl , to be something less than a fertility symbol . ) All Danae , she took the tumbling gold , conceived , turned lovingly to Clem and swore the child to be was his . " But Dick asked a serious question and I derailed him , " Clem said . " What happened to the play ? You can go see for yourself , unless you want to wait for the movie at your neighborhood theater . It wo n't close for a week yet and I 'll get you front-row tickets for any night you want to go and witness . " When I said nothing , he went on , impatient with me , " You do n't have to do public mourning . It wo n't have died when you see it die . It died when I saw it die  --  so I 'm still ahead of the game . " He laughed . " You really think I 'm a horseshit con man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , and at the same time you 're honestly panged when the corpse stops making money . So ! Everybodyloves the Cinderella story after all , in spite of all their twaddle about the patient Griseldas . I knew that was so . Every time that inwit twanged  --  I have conscience like you , reverend sir !  --  and Ip367had a choice to go ahead with things as they are or not to go ahead , I thought , Dick he 'll believe , as well as he can , that Boy died for purity ' if I say , No , you bastards can not get me to do your dirty work . ' But in the back of his mind he 'll always believe that my play did n't make Broadway because it was n't good enough . He 'll never know what was lost unless I show it to him in process of being lost . " Susan laughed , " My , my . Do n't be so solemn . I think if anyone , Dick would un  --  " " What difference does it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , more in embarrassment of the spirit than in social embarrassment . And then it came once again clearly  --  that it made no difference . He had used my name illustratively , no more than that , to stand for all of those who had placed on him the obligation of resolving the contradictions that tyrannized over their happy lives . " What ? Solemn ? I ? I 'm merely all things to all men , " Clem said . " Solemn Dick turns me mauve , that 's all , Chucky . Ca n't you tell when I am in jest ? Anderswer always . You wash your consciences in salt and I use the latest detumescent . No primal elder curse on mine . Let the damn play go , it tells me . Except for our bruited arms hung up for monuments , ' in the second act , there 's not a word of Anderson left in it . " " It was a very moving play , " Susan said solemnly . Then , to unwind us from an argument that would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't the Devil  --  though the smell of sulphur stayed in the room ) , Gorman came . Grave , impeccable , soft-spoken and gross , he came in with snow on his coat to be among us like a great mama , tolerant of any consciencegames or games of communication the children may be playing , but knowing all too well that games are pointless attempts to outwit the insuperable authority of the present . A perfect soldier of life , as ready for feast as famine . A man who made his late arrival the right time to come . This night Susan promised feast as soon as he entered . He rubbed his hands softly over all her promises and sent her off to the kitchen with an urbane blessing , turned to Clem and me and found us good  --  as he would have found either a pair of martini-liberated angels or a pair of rodents idling in a carcass . He was certainly a man for silver linings , and if the building had been on fire I think he would have remarked on how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his massive , peasant style , a very handsome old man , bald or shave-pated as a Prussian general , and I was particularly impressed by his chocolate-dark eyes , those eyes within eyes that one sees in good photographs of Picasso . " I have good news for you if you want it , " he told Clem , while every nerve in his relaxed body praised the martini shimmering between his fingers when he twirled the glass . " It is from Archie . Arch Orcup , " he explained to me . " He loves Death , and in furtherance of his genuine admiration he meant what he said with a view to engagingyour services in regard to the screenplay , Clem . " " Bully ! " Clem said . " I have from the initial had inculpable respect for the artistic integrity and frenetic good taste of all the productions emanating under the Orcup imprimatura . " " Otherwise we might as well have sold to Billy , " Gorman said . " Billy Stevens . " " Except that Billy was recalcitrant to unleash the old purse strings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " He would have seen fit , " Gorman said dreamily . " The question always pervading uppermost was not whether Billy felt enough admiration for the play to see its tremendous potential in another medium . He liked it . But Archie loved it . He said this afternoon in our telephone conversation from the coast , Max , I cried . ' When he saw it he cried each time , he said , genuine tears , and that is something for a man positioned as he . He wanted it . " " How about when he wanted me to do the screenplay ? Were his tears pretty genuine ? " " Ha ha , " Gorman said . " That is an extremely funny reference to the extent of his desire to do the artistically best possible . I see . He indicated no obstacle to twenty-five thousand . " " And we are positioned to assume that Arch Orcup 's indication is his bond ? " A slight frown , like the shadow of a hummingbird crossing a polar icecap moved up the dome of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be extremely unwise not to assure that the spirit of the original is not violated by some hack . He seemed to agree . " Clem laughed like a giant , liberated from the profitless quibbles that had lurked in his conversation with me . ( And I was glad to see them swept away . ) " I 've always wanted to do a spirit play . Be the hack of the spirit . For a few thousand would n't I be unwise not to guard the spirit while they 're violating the body ? "  | " I warned him , so it is off of my head that your integrity has had a reputation of being uncontrollable though not violent , " Gorman said smiling . " I wish to repeat in so many words what Archie said to me verbatim . I love 'm tough , ' he said . Apparently he was not unacquainted through theatrical gossip and word of mouth about your intransigent attitudes toward not compromising . I was deeply moved to hear him instance , I need allies out here . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father was . " " Who is so mean as to compromise with compromise ? Whole hog or none . No king , no bishop . Susan ! " Clem shouted toward the kitchen . " Our bruited arms hung up for monuments ' indeed ! Orcup and Anderson will go down together with their yellow banners flying ! I 've raised my yellow battle flag , Hollywood . H000 , h0000 . Susan , we 're en route again ! " Then his nose wrinkled as he smelled what I had been smelling for some time . From the kitchen ( it must have come out in a blast when the oven door was open ) an actual smell of burning flesh was drifting upon us , as if it were a purposeful counterirritant to the smell I had been imagining . " My love 's on fire , " Clem shouted to us , and he galloped out to find if that was really so . Presently screeches and wails  --  in goodhumoredplay , as far as I could tell  --  came in from the same source as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good humor  --  and because I did n't dare risk an observation that might have seemed carping  --  I covered it by saying loudly to Gorman , " Well , your news seems to have made him happy . " Gorman measured me by that remark , silently said , Oh , dear , to himself , then seemed to decide I could n't be quite such a fool . " No . He is not happy . Clement is a very complex personality , a true artistpersonality . Money can not make him happy . " I said that nevertheless it seemed to give symptomatic relief . Gormanreplied to me with a silence that said he knew very well that psychiatrists had their jargon , but since I presumably had one too , why did n't I stick to my own ? And in that silence we heard Clem 's voice . " I told you for Jesus Christ 's sake to get in a maid or a cook . He 's an old friend . " Gorman said , " Clement takes things too hard . He told you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one 's fault to discontinue the play ? Yes ? He took occasion to offer a heartbreak/ing scene to one and all the guests at my party last night . Revolting to such as fail to comprehend the artist nature or make all due allowances . Not as a man ought to behave . His levity is frequently superficialto hide the true hurt . Money may not be a boon to him as some people find it . " Then he shrugged . " But he wants it so badly . " And of all the things Clem wanted badly , that was one , at least , that he could be given . Susan had done as well with her dining table as she had with the Christmas tree I admired so much . We were called in presently to a handsome and conservative display of bounty . Steaming vegetables , Technicolor salads , good wine and the handsome platter that bore the duck were all so tempting as to be almost vocal in their invitation to enjoy them . Tall candles waved their yellow flags . At the head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had Clement Anderson , pink-cheeked and sick of Christmas , tamed by all of us who meant to give him what he wanted , full of tremors and tics and memories of indignity , but able to go on . What Susan had assembled in her dining room had to be worth all it cost , I thought as I sat down . I could think of nothing to pray for except that this much felicity , at least , would endure . We settled into our places with a counterpointed conversation about our individual memories of Christmas  --  how it had been in Vienna before the Anschluss , in Boda that first winter that Clem went home from college ( he had gone with Sheila , but he told it now as if he had been alone ) , in Los Angeles where Susan had ( quite literally like Cinderella ) suffered from a cruel ( but in this telling comic ) stepmother , and my paling memories of boyhood in Buffalo . To the degree that was required we knew each other now , and it may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disaster which gave us a sense of belonging equally to a family where none of us had prerogatives over the others . When she cleared away the plates and the wineglasses from the first course , Susan let her hand rest very briefly but warmly on my shoulder , as if she had felt from all the evening that had preceded that I was the one who most needed reassurance . Then she asked Clem to begin carving the duck . The knife and fork he took up were the latest , tasteful thing in Danish steel , with wooden handles . Costly Excaliburs among cutlery.  |p371But  they would not penetrate that small , resistant carcass Clem had pulled up in front of him . It appeared that his first effort to cut was in all good faith and confidence . But as his arm began to saw faster and faster without consequence , a look faintly querulous and sly spread over his face . He put one elbow on the table , cocking the knife up beside his ear . With the fork he poked here and there at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cook this with a flame thrower ? " he asked . " It 's all right ! " Susan insisted . " Stop clowning . " He tried to saw his way in again . He held the blade up and stared at its edge . " The brave man does it with a sword , " he said . " Cowards with a razor . Susan , go to the bathroom and get  --  " I saw Susan 's mouth drawn back from her teeth , not in a grin but in an absolute , uncontrollable rage . " All right , funny man , " she said with a tragic hiss . " You 've showed off enough for one night at my expense . Flush the toilet ! ' Give me the knife . Let me do it if you ca n't . " " No . " Again Clem started to saw . Our wineglasses all began to jiggle and presently to slop over on the spotless cloth . " Give it to me . " Susan reached across the table and grabbed one of the trussed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it off the platter and ran for the kitchen with it , Susan after him . And there they seemed to be fighting for it . There was a wild uproar of threshing bodies , falling pans , crockery breaking , and sliding feet . Finally a slam as someone  --  and it would have been Susan  --  was thrown full length on the floor . Then sobs . Gorman and I did not look at each other . They came back at last with Clem in the lead , bearing the platter on which lay the mutilated duck . He had hacked it apart with a butcher knife  --  or clawed it apart with his nails . It reminded me vaguely of a Japanese soldier who had committed hara-kiri by explodinga hand grenade inside his trousers . Clem wore an alcoholic smirk of triumph . Susan 's face was locked in a smile . He put the platter before us , saying , " Only my wife , gentlemen , could manage to burn it and leave it raw in one operation . " " It 's not raw , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's rare . " " Do n't tell me that is n't blood . Only a cannibal would touch it . Let 's all have something to drink instead . "  | " Please , " Gorman said . " It 's good food . Let us eat and be thankful . " He and I served ourselves . " I suppose that horse-face Sheila could have done better , " Susan said . No one heard her . At least none of us dared let her outcry strike full in the center of our consciousness . But in evading it we gave up the frail hopeful pretenses of sociability with which the meal had begun . We went on talking afterward . The cadence and volume of sound were not for more than a second abated . But after this I felt that Susan was watching the rest of us with the malign anxiety of a child who has understood that the threat of screaming will compel adults to do almost anything . Clem ate nothing at all , but drank wine instead , sneering at us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mud . Now and then I had the illusion that the wine was sobering him , or keeping up some constant , necessary level of combustible alcohol in his blood which in turn sustained his will to restore the eggshell surfaceof our communion . I believe to this day that when he began to talk about Susan he saw himself as her protector , redressing some grievous impression she had made on us . Ever since he met her , he said , he had told her that she ought to write a novel about her life . It could be called The Darling , he had suggested , not because there was a Chekhov story of that title  --  though there was indeed , indeed there was , and Susan was very much like the woman Chekhov described in that she could remake herself into the ideal wife of any man she married  --  but because it would give a modern , or , one might say , a twentieth-century , replay of the Chekhovian idea , and in our time and place the requirements for a darling were interestingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he encouraged her to put down everything she could remember from her chameleon childhood and surchameleon days in Hollywood . She was to put down with utter frankness the pain she had felt from being considered so stupid in grade school . Actually she was not stupid at all , but merely reticent , as so many children are who suffer the handicaps of having worthless and stupid parents . Her teachers had not understood that her passionate interest was focused on going to Shirley Temple movies rather than the subjects to which they wished to force her . It bespoke her nature as darling to have found an elderly sea captain who shared her enthusiasm for Shirley and took her to every Temple picture notp373once but ten , twenty , thirty times . The children at school who knew only a runny-nosed , lath-skinny , tongue-tied little moron would have been astounded to hear her and the sea captain discussing at length and in incredible detail every bit of dialogue and every tinseled cliche from each of these films . But the sea captain had died suddenly  --  no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was working up his nerve to violate his little friend , but perhaps untimely , since he had many times promised to include her in his will . After the captain 's death her stepmother had made inquiries , but had been told there was no will . The old gentleman'sproperty had gone to three widowed sisters . In Clem 's serious view , a spark had been lighted by the glamour of all those movies . Miraculously , however you looked at it ( and he could see that the story might be told with utter vulgarity or with supremedelicacy ) , the homely child had transformed herself  --  from the inside out  --  into her ideal . She had become beautiful from contemplatingan ideal of beauty . As we knew , that sometimes happened , and right here at the table we had the living proof that the celluloid Shirley could be re-created in the flesh . Well , not to go through the whole story tonight ( " Thank God , " Susan said with a half-flattered , half-hostile laugh ) but to get back to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , take the way Susan had transformed herself in the relatively short space of time that she had been his darling . She had never read a book except The Brothers Karamazov before she met him , and even with that she had trouble . She could n't keep Brother William distinct from Brother Alphonse and never did know why the Devil should speak to Ivan in the language that Ivan himself had used . But since she had become the beloved of an egghead she had embarked on a task of self-education that would astonish Horace Mann and John Dewey themselves . She had been through the great books that contained all the great ideas ever conceived by the human mind and was herself a walking , talking synopticon . Not content with immersing herself in modern literature , she had looked into the literatureof every major period , and though he would not claim she had read , say , Ovid 's Metamorphoses , he was sure she was familiar with it , as with Wordsworth 's Prelude or Horace 's most important odes . Many a time he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love poems by Alfred , Lord Tennyson , Christina Rossetti and Andrew Marvell , notp374to mention John Donne , in whose works she had found , marveling , that a man who lived over three hundred years ago could have had such a modern attitude toward love . That was what he meant by insisting  --  and he would insist !  --  that her book be called The Darling . For once again , as in the case of the Shirley Temple movies , an ideal had been fixed in her mind and she was transforming herself utterly to comply with it . He hoped that she would not carry this to the point of transforming ( again ) her physical appearance . No , her darling trick there must be to preserve herself just as she was . But the spiritual woman who emerged at last would be as different as a butterfly from a larva . I said that Clem began this awful description , analysis , whatever it was , with some intention of showing her off to advantage . And though his tone was impossible to interpret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the probably solemn , each of us was being given an interpretation . When he finally began to dribble off into incoherencesand sleepy mutterings to himself , I was dismayed almost to despair to see that it all had mollified Susan considerably . The pages of the ledger he had bought her would , I was afraid , remain forever blank . Still , he had got us through the meal with his ramblings before he passed out . But halfway through , something had seemed to go wrong with my teeth so that the invulnerable , bleeding duck flesh I chewed would not yield at all . Bit by bit I had to swallow it whole . Then , like all genuine tortures , the meal ended abruptly . Susan said , as if everything were all right , " Would you gentlemen like to retire to the living room for your liqueurs ? " But once Gorman and I were on our feet we were both too smart to sit down again . We edged toward the entrance hall bubbling excuses , allying ourselves in a polite phalanx of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stay on . I thought she might be afraid of a physical assault from Clem , but apparently she was not . In any case I was not to be held by the promise of any more goodies . Clem had not come from the dining room when we were putting on our coats . I was trying to decide whether or not to risk going back to say good night to him when he finally came trotting after us . His face was so distressed that he might have been afraid of being left with her . He grabbed Gorman 's arm and mine , saying , " Do n't go without Clem . We 'll go down and look at Brooklyn Bridge . So much to see and every night . "  | " Some other time , " we both said . We both asked him to call us in the morning . " Too proud . I come from very aristocratic lines , though crossed . Hyacinth , chien de race . Screw you , buddies . " He half turned to the right , lunged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight into the wall . He dropped like a poleaxed steer and lay there so ominously still that I bent to feel his pulse . It seemed strong to me , and I thought that both Gorman and Susan were smiling condescendingly at my concern . We got him onto his feet then and walked him into the bedroomlike a surrealist wheelbarrow with rubbery handles and legs for spokes . At the door he reeled away from us . With luck or weird dexterity he contrived to land plumply on his back on the bed . But all evidence of ability to take care of himself was annoying at this point . He lay there snoring and seeming asleep . Susan , with a wink at us that was intended to say , He 's just a lovable pranky boy and all 's well , pulled off his shoes . Then , before we turned away to leave them , she began unbuckling his belt . No doubt in wifely kindness , only ill-timed because she was a bit drunk herself , she opened his fly and began to pull off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have done this before we were quite gone , but I would have thought nothing of it if Clem had not suddenly , out of his apparently deep stupor , reached to seize her wrists , half raising himself and looking wildly from one to anotherof us . " Button me , " he begged in what I swear was the voice of a child . " Button me ! I 'm writing a great poem . It cancels hope . Do you understand that , Dick ? Button me , somebody . " Susan bore him back onto the bed , falling heavily on him , kissing his wet temples and the curling locks of hair plastered against them . " I 'll button you , darling . Oh , I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . " Quietly Gorman and I took our way out of the house . We stood on the curb together a few minutes later , pulling our scarves tighter against the increasing snow . Cabs were scarce at this hour , but we let two or three go by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by which we might excuse ourselves for what we had seen . " You know , " Gorman said at length . " Susan made herself a very dead pigeon for him . " " I suppose this is n't the first time they 've had . . . an uproar. "  | " Not the uproar . What she said about Sheila , " he insisted wisely . " That was very  --  final . " " He wo n't remember tomorrow that she said it . " " Let us hope not , " he said . " I hope our Clement will understand he needs her . But in my estimation he will remember . " Then a cab spotted us and pulled up . I insisted that he take it . I wanted to stand a while in the snow until I had some mastery over my own thoughts , some thread by which I could connect what I knew damn well I was going to remember of tonight with the judgments and prejudices I lived with on the other side of the abyss . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chew the duck at dinner , and my stomach told me I could not stand to swallow much more whole . I remember the wave after wave of resentment that passed over me as I stood there , racking me like the convulsions of vomiting . And the promises I made to myself to blot out of my mind all I knew of Clem except the best . So I consoled myself , without purgation . All of this experience in New York was still lying in great undigested chunks in my mind when I went home a few days later ( without seeing Clem or Sheila or Susan again  --  I had only nerve enough to go see Clem 's play ) . Mere distance gave me some perspective on it  --  all that distance can , at any rate . Time let it settle . And Janet helped , as she always does in crises of doubt , by assuring me that no good lies in suffering over things that can not be helped . Only  --  once when we were still talking about it in February  --  she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Do you think it ca n't be helped ? " " How so ? " " I do n't mean helped right now . And I do n't think I mean helped by us , though if an occasion did present itself where we could do something I 'd  --  do almost anything to help , including slipping arsenic to that Cindy Susan . " " Susan is good . " " You 're very stubborn about that and you may be right and I 'm not talented in poisons anyway , " Janet said . " Nevertheless  --  " " Nevertheless you think it would be better if Susan were gently removed , somehow erased from reality , canceled like God 's error . " " I do n't wish her any harm , in fact I 'm willing to wish her all the best . On your say-so . Only , is n't the best , as we conceive it , thatp377Clem and Sheila should get back together again ? And is n't there from all you 've told me  --  every reason to think they will ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " If Clem does n't drink himself to death first . " " It 's more than a possibility , " Janet said . " I have a secure faith that 's what will happen . Barring accidents , of course . It 's not so different from when Clem went to war and got mixed up with that Englishgirl  --  got her pregnant or whatever he did and the child was stillbornand he came back to Sheila . He and Sheila are still very much linked . You 've dwelt enough on that impression . And I think Clem wants to come back . Wants to dump his showers of gold in Sheila 's lap . " " The English girl was never pregnant , " I said . Furthermore there were a thousand uncertainties that Janet 's theory skipped over blithely . And yet I found increasingly that the possibility Janet liked to dwell on was coming to seem a likelihood to me  --  was beginning to show where all the inscrutable signs I had noted at Christmas were pointing . I was sure enough that it was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us still knew enough of Clem to know that he wanted it , too . And then , in March of that year , Jill ( that faithful hound of superficialfacts ) found a piece in the paper that told us Cindy Hunt was dead . She had died ( poor Pseudonym ) of an ectopic pregnancy while vacationing in Mexico with her husband , " screenwriter Clement Anderson . " Pseudonymous death had caught her all unexpectedly , this graceless announcement said . When the couple left Hollywood a week before the tragic mischance , she had appeared in " radiant health . " The report was , like all the trashy prose in which Cindy Hunt had lived and charmed us , so shallow and unreal that the one absolutely accurate fact of death seemed hardly to contrast with any of the testimoniesthat she had lived . Where life is reduced to glamour , the glamorous fact of death hardly seems a change worth mourning . I remembered my half-drunken intuition that she was of the " superfluouspopulation , " a mere number . The brisk falsity of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad dream confirms another . But she had reached for life , this neverborn one , and I had intimations , too , of the cruel ironies involved in her wish.  |p378When  Janet heard the news she was silent , lost in a maze of guilt that may have made her envy those born with a talent for poison . We would not discuss the guilt we knew , for it lay too far from the center of our lives , like the low-lying cindery clouds on the horizon that , on a sunny day , bring storm to some other city . We had no language to express directly our responsibility . But I asked , after allowing time for the immediate shock to pass , " Do you think Clem will go back to Sheila now ? " Instead of answering directly she said , " I did n't want it to happen this way . " And it seemed to both of us that what we hoped for would be harder now that the visible obstacle was removed . THESE INLAND YEARS of my life , the enjoyment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great deal and spared me nothing . In my privacy I have heard the muttering of the sea that means to have , in its own time , its own . At noon on a windless day I have heard the trees shake and , at the cocktail hour , among undemanding , respected and respectful friends , have known without warning  --  as if the very absence of warning were the symbol of its profundity  --  what the elder Henry James called " a sense of vastation . " Sometimes that primal dream of loss , of something being over before one quite knows it is happening , has come on me in the comfort of lethargy , as palpitations come on a day of supreme health , or as thoughts of Peter seeking his inverted crucifixion come to terrify one on Easter morning . I always told curious or interested friends that I had enjoyed Clem 's Death and the Devil very much when I saw it performed in New York . I told the truth . I had enjoyed it , just as at first meeting I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not more shaken by my glimpse of Clem 's second marriage than by my awareness of what he had done to his play . In saying this I do not suppose I am venturing into the field of theatrical criticism . That field , like every other compartmented aspectof our present life , has its experts . They in turn have support in depth from those initiated in the present taste . For all I know such people may have unbeatable stratagems for demonstrating that Clem 's play in the form eventually produced on Broadway was " better " than his original drafts . I would have to concede that the stylized and disciplined action Ip382watched that night won such an authority over my emotions as to disengage them effectively from thoughts awakened when I had read the play some time before in Paris . In the theater I did not think of the " real " Potters on whom the characters had been modeled , and , more significantly , I found in the central female character no allegory of the creative imagination wakened to the point of vulnerabilityand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to suggest this much , supposing Cecile to be an objectified representation of the mind , baited beyond its safe shell of innocence by the promises of the natural and social worlds ) . Like a visitor in a well-appointed hospital waiting room , I was made to feel in the theater that what passed before my diverted eyes was all that was real of tragedy and death . The past  --  the human condition , our war , our betrayed youth  --  was only this doctored spectacle , and of its timid " Boo " no one who could afford the price of admission need be much frightened . The central character of the play  --  still like Cecile in this respect  --  had an insuperable wound . But in the version I saw this had been transposed from Cecile 's short upper lip into a psychic preoccupation with the house in which she and five generations of ancestors had been born . ( " We stopped old Boney at the Channel , and we 've stopped Mr. Hitler , " says an old retainer who might as well have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historic house was confirmed and touched with a hint of evil by the suggestions of incest yielded by her recollections of her father . No more hint of incest than a lady would carry from spraying some into the air and walking through it ; nevertheless , a fashionable scent . ( The play was Cherry Orchard Becomes Electra , as Clem had so precisely characterizedit . " You ca n't sell the money men on art unless you can show them where you invoked Chekhov or Old Gene , " he said . ) The aging friend whom Cecile intends initially to marry is not depicted as a philologist . ( If he were a philologist the audience would expect him to be doing something with words . ) He is a titled neighbor who resembles and wishes to resemble the girl 's dead , amorous father . The American soldier who comes to waken the sleeping princess with his playboy kisses and brash irreverence is an oddly scrambled version of Clem as he might have appeared to a sociologist with the troops . ( Given that any sociologist who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1944 would probably , in ten years , have alteredp3383his findings to conform to intellectual fads . I do not mean to set them above playwrights in responsibility to their subject . ) The soldier , at any rate , is just so much of an idealist as will expose the danger represented by idealists to an audience schooled to mistrust " true believers " in anything . He believes in Freud 's task of liberation ( " If the girl needs a lay , lay her " ) , the Four Freedoms ( " Think of it . Freedom from fear ! Never to be afraid again . Do n't be afraid , darling , I wo n't hurt you " ) , les lendemains qui chanteraient ( " a better Coventry will rise from the mire and ashes " ) , Romanticism 's divinity of the flesh ( " I believe that my body in yours is God in God " ) . He believes in Free France , equality of the races , sexes and faiths , and when he mentions a group of men the third name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For a cheap laugh , he is represented as believing in the Century of the Common Man . Now , given his own interpretations , these were all things that Clem had believed in when , once upon a time , he fell among the Potters . He had believed along with many of the rest of us , who probably had our own interpretations of them as well . But these beliefs had plainly been salted into the character as ingredients to prepare the audience for his untrustworthy behavior , to make them laugh with the slightly uncomfortable recollection that Back Then they had trifled with such foolishness , too . Cecile 's mother comes across as an oddly proportioned figure of comedy and tragedy , presiding over her daughter 's seduction by the handsome stranger very much like the stock figure of Mom in the antiMomliterature of our societal critics . She means to pay off everyone , including her dead husband . She is not a woman to take incest lying down . Most illuminating , though , was the transposition that had been made in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's life , after the hero , with fake idealism , deserts her for battle , the girl at home and country . In the drafts I had once read in Paris , it had been a Negro sergeant who plucked the awakened Cecile , got her pregnant and was senselesslymurdered by her in her final retreat into the darkness from which the idealistic soldier ( the Devil of the title ? ) had pretended the wish to free her . Harkness , the buck-toothed educator of reality , had gone through the avatar of a Negro Young Man Carbuncular to become  --  underp384the exigency of offending no ticket-buying or reviewing liberals  --  a gross Southern proletarian , come to England by way of a Detroit assemblyline . ( When the work was restreamlined for Hollywood  --  not by Clem after all ; he never reported back to the studio after Susan 's death  --  this character would appear as an underprivileged and misunderstoodyouth , temperamentally inclined toward rape and therefore eminently forgivable because of inadequate recreational facilities as a child . ) On stage they were an altogether likable and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their simplicity consoled me while I was in my seat . While the snub-nosed actress tore Cecile 's goblin-haunted silencesto tatters and with a definitive pistol shot disposed of the boorishintruder in her sexual garden , I felt protected from the host of unborn possibilities that I once thought were Clem 's real legacy from the war , shared with very many of us who had less promise of articulatingthem . Charmed and comforted in the theater , I felt how much better were the lightly hidden secrets of the past which the post-Freudian theater can display with a prestidigitator 's sweep of revelation than the fatal obviousness of the actual Cecile 's ugly mouth . We would pretend not to notice her mouth in social life . You ca n't tell a lady to her face that her irremediable skull has determined the conditions of her unhappiness . And the theater is a social institution , where all raging material is made conformable to social usages . In a welldoctoredplay , like Clem 's , motives are served up like the courses in a formal meal  --  and how much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's poetic notion that " motives are nothing much , God reads the event . " Once upon a time what I had most admired in Clem 's discoveries as a writer was a kind of Calvinism that had nothing to do with the schema of psychiatry or the social sciences , a candor at once ruthless and benevolent in its discriminations , a persuasive sense of the value or weight of every kind of circumstance , which seemed to me the superlative gift for a writer . Grace of this gift and by its grace alone a writer can point out what is beyond redemption in our lives and what is not  --  that is , write in the tragic vein , establishing some contactof awe between us and the mysteries that live us . Once he repudiateshis gift , he descends to the pretense that anyone and any/thing is redeemable , if and if and if . He descends to the social lie that , with its pretenses of explaining everything , shelters us so briefly from reality . I had come to the point of feeling satisfied that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tragedy , and perhaps my reflections on that night in the theater brought me to face Clem 's willful betrayal of the past and to the question of why he had done it . To answer the question of why Clem himself had abstracted the play from its responsibilities  --  rendering it truly into a " nonrepresentational " work , in some ways like the paintings that were the fashion of the epoch  --  would be no more and no less , I have thought , than to answer the question of why he left Sheila . For more than once I have thought that Clem 's divorce was a literary artifice manque , either tried in the wrong medium or an accidental byproductof the theatrical medium he was then assaying . I suppose it is often the case that a writer  --  if he is a good writer and unless he is a very great writer or is supported by a conservative religious faith  --  is apt to cut his literary images with the same scissors he uses on life , like a child who cuts an admirable paper star @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same time . The immediate and personal life may be involved in the creative act because there is nothing else to feed the imagination . However detached the artist may wish to be , he will learn sometime that the world on which his imagination acts is singular and indivisible . His discoveries , if they have any value , are always going to be overdetermined , as Freud says dreams are . But , I am told by all those who wish to admire the products of the artist and ignore his life , we do not ask of the imagination that it involve and compromise the private life of the artist . Well , of course not . Nothing is asked of the imagination originally , for only the unsummoned imagination can conceive what it might be asked . And then , in the tragic denouement of an artist 's life , in that period when the admirers of the work wish to avert their eyes , the imagination discovers nothing to be worth its attention except that cruel process from which it was born . Then the dissolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is seen to be not spurious , but fated . I was told by both Clem and Sheila that the period in which hep386was rewriting the play to fit the requirements of the new public coincided remarkably with the period in which he was , so to speak , getting ready to publish word of a divorce ripening to its term . Line by line he labored to transpose what he had first wrought into its marketable equivalent , and tissue by tissue he simultaneously transposedthe responsibilities , joys and agonies of his marriage into annoyances , impediments and obstacles holding him back from the immolationhis imagination had begun to shape . One might , I suppose , still argue that this coincidence of times is meaningless in itself . There is nothing inevitably mantic about a decision to make money by pleasing the customer . And I would concede that the servility with which he followed the coils of fashion in the theater is only part of the overdetermination for the dream in which he died . It is only when one assumes a chosen and deliberate  --  an expressive  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permitted to say that all of it expresses the same terrible mockery , and the same love . I think he corrupted and disfigured himself  --  life and work  --  because he was ours . As if , by divorce and the castration of his play , the same statement in different modes , he were to say , " I gave you my wife and my enjoyable play because I owed you explanations . You were addicted to saying , when you were literate enough , that always Time 's winged chariot behind your back you heard . But who except yourselves did Time 's work on your generation ? By the kindest-seemingand most tolerant of frauds you sold yourselves for the sake of selves you never meant to become . Saturn had no appetite for his children more savage than your wish to swallow down what children you once knew yourselves to be . You were still unconquered when you came home from your war  --  and what you were then you consumedto make into a race more convenient to its inventions and better tuned to its self-lies than it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war at near-bankrupting cost you translated into an alien tongue . I thought you were in Rats Alley , where the painters lost their subject matter . You made yourselves alien in your own land and lives . You went abstract ' to escape the concrete weapons you had to manufacture . Then  --  look !  --  so did I , because I was a writer and as a writer I was nothing if I did not go with you into your wilderness . " But the rest of us have outlived him ? For a while.  |p387I  believe the vulgarization itself of his play is part of the code by which he expressed what he knew , that the play , in his ironic hands , became an inscrutable mirror that shows us what we have become with the same mocking efficiency as it hides what we might have been , as if it were the ultimate trick of the technique for a period of decadence of which Cyril Connolly speaks . I have no keys to its code . I would like to trace back the process of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its pure genesis , and I can only make a gross leap back in time to show the vacated camp where the visions were hatched . The play serves only as a device for contrasting one kind of literary success with another . Against the opaque banality of the play I set a few years of Clem 's actual life when he clarified for himself the tragic view required to make him accept it . If all too much of my account will seem a lament for talents missing the mark they might have defined for themselves , still I can now report a time when he truly reigned as King of the Hill . In the first years after the war he had what he deserved to have . He became what , from the first , he had intended to be . I think that during the period of this success he took on Prometheandebts ( to use Jung 's grateful phrase ) . He would go on paying those debts to the end of his paradoxical life . The powers would at last say to him , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does it matterthat you have forgotten why ? Go on . We 'll let you rub your nose in it . " But the profit of his bargain depends on the angle from which it is observed . If one goes back to the high plateau where he taught himselfhow to love fate , one can feel that he must then have loved even what he foresaw of the topsy-turvy descent that his generation 's innocenceand sloth would require of him . IN THE SUMMER of 1946 Clem , Sheila , Janet and I shared a house three miles north of Acapulco . We lived on the ocean side of town , where the breakers were too high for swimming . Our little house satp388in a lush nest of trees surrounded by shale and scrub . The sun bore down hard all day long , but the mornings were good for work . Clem and I both had " studies . " At least , we had places to which we could retire alone . Mine was on a palm-shaded north veranda . His was in a little barn on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our worktables both of us could see the beach where our wives spent the morning  --  leather-colored girls against the fantasticallyglittering wall of surf . A mile down the beach was the Pogorskis ' shanty . When we refused to talk to our wives at need , they went there for refreshments and passionate conversation , and for such news of the world recoveringfrom the war as came through Claude Pogorski 's treble indignation . Overhead there were always vultures . No doubt they fulfilled a purely symbolic function , since I never , to my recollection , saw one of them stoop to pick up food . Sheila was in the early months of her first pregnancy . In figure and character she displayed the heart-knotting exuberance of a woman who has seized exactly all she wants . At noon she would sit half drowsily at the table with us , smiling at flies and lizards , stuffing herself with melons and the fish delivered by a boy who bicycled out from town . Now and then out of sheer inability to contain her satisfactionshe trailed her fingers on Clem 's bare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to affect  --  in imitation of her , he said . " How 're we going to persuade her home ? " Clem would say with a pretense of worry , balancing a seed on the tip of his tongue and spitting it onto the stones between his tennis shoes . " O.K. , then . I 'll build you a stone tower here and become the spic Robinson Jeffers . " " I 'm worth it . I breed good , " Sheila said . " I am what the poets labored for . " " That 's one of my titles . Do n't get it soiled before I write something to go with it , " Clem said . Lowering his lids against the unfalteringglare from the sea , he explained that he had spent the entire morning in his study making up more titles . " I 'm going to write a book that 's made up of nothing but titles . " " It wo n't pass the time , " Janet said . " No . But it will be language charged to its highest potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People wo n't have to reread a lot of filler that they 've already read , " he insisted . " Imagine a reader who 's got a thousand novels already under his belt , and in every one of them somebody runs out in the street at some point and hails a cab to take him to some importantplace . Who wants to read about that after a thousand times ? And , as far as important places go , how many are there ? The home of some ginch fuming like nitric acid . One . Bars where significant or nostalgic rendezvous take place . Two . Hospitals where people have reconciliations after near-fatal accidents . Three . Now , who wants to read about those things over and over again ? " " Put in new adjectives , " Janet said . " There are no more , " Clem said . " So I merely mean to take accountof the fact that my readers have read other fiction and give them a list of evocative titles . They can imagine for themselves all this stuff about fuming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait . Do n't criticize until you understand . Let me try some on you . " " I am what the poets labored for , " Sheila said . " Be quiet , " Clem admonished . " ' Bad Cat , ' " he said . He looked at us expectantly and we looked at him expectantly . He seemed disappointed . " You do n't see the story ? " he demanded . " Bad Cat ! ' " he shouted , as if shouting might prompt us to have the complete fictional vision . Then , more in disappointment than in anger , he said , " I ca n't hear those syllables without at once visualizing a depressing city landscape with someone like John Garfield coming along kicking a can . He looks up and sees this forty-year-old woman peering down at him through the slats of the fire escape . He hails a taxicab , goes to a bar where the beer fumes like dry ice  --  All right .

He glared at her . " That 's not a reference to me . You do n't get it ,  |p390stu|pid  ? On a terrible , hot day during the drought years this bum drops off the freight train that twice a week goes through Boda . Later it emerges that he was once a successful boy evangelist in Los Angeles but has become a cross between an existentialist and a psychotic . No one knows what to make of him , but they need something , with all that sun boiling down on them and the earth spinning like a nasty little cinder  --  " " Now the taxicab ? " Janet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he told her loftily . His expression changed to gratitude , and with an Anderson pencil ( a chewed yellow stick splintered at both ends , sometimes producing only indentations when he wrote ) he added something to his list . " No Taxicabs in Boda , ' " he said in awe . " I get that one , " I said . " Someone who looks like John Garfield is walking past the Baptist church . He looks up and sees a forty-yearoldwoman peering down at him from the belfry . It is his mother . He tries to hail a taxicab , but . . . but . . . " " You 're a fit reader , " Clem acknowledged . " No taxis , but plenty of fuming girls , " Sheila said . " Clem 's been remembering all the girls in Boda for three generations so he can use them in his novel .

The question was whether , being sanitary , they might or might not have access to the German cathousepatronized by my copains .

Death and the Devil , ' The Ascent of Pride , " Batter My Heart , " Batter My  --  ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Janny ? Do n't you realize that everything I do is work ? I 'm working now , " he said in sudden astonishment , paus/ing to stare in wonderment down the relaxed , banana curve of his body , disposed in utterly indolent torpor over the cushions with which he had fattened his chair . He stared significantly up at the vultures , an indication and a gesture designed not at all to carry our gaze upward but to demonstrate the process of his toiling . " He 's working on a poem about vultures , " I said . " Clem , when I have fears that you may cease to be before your pen has garnered up these daily treasures  --  " " Gerald ! " he said , staring at me . " What ? " " You reminded me of Gerald Potter , who used to bat my lines back like that . " " And you 're writing about him , too ? At this very minute ? " He would not deny it . " About everything . About everything that has ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You ought to read what I 'm doing , Dick . Modesty aside , it is something like The Iliad . ' " And if modesty were not put aside ? " It would be just the same , " Clem said . " And it 's going to go on forever . " He stared up contentedly at the vultures and finished his wine . " We 're going to stay here until I 've remembered every awful thing that ever happened and put it down . Jesus , a vulture is a lovely bird . He eats everything . Dick , is n't there some culture where the vulture is a god ? " I quoted " Une Saison en Enfer " : " I bury the dead in my belly . ' " " That 's very like The Iliad , too , " he said . " I wonder if I can work that in somewhere ? I 've done just that , you know . In my belly . " Through ten weeks of that prosperous summer we were treated to some such dwindling eruption of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , his way of unwinding from his morning 's work , a playful scattering before his grubby fellows of the gems he had that morning unearthed without finding a place for them in the opus at hand . But after a while , beyond the plain profusion of gauds and trinkets that seemed to mushroom into his head  --  which would not distinguish him from a run-of-the-mill master of ceremonies or anyone else with a gift for patter  --  I began to notice the way some of his throwaway ideas would reappear , enlarged or given a fresh nuancep392so that I could feel we were overhearing what he heard down in the barn where he was making his novel . That is , there was a constant sifting and sorting detectable even to me . He was finding out which of all that mighty sum of fragments under review were sterile and which might , properly tended , grow . And I got some idea of how his immediate circumstances and whatever people were around him were the soil into which he thrust his growing shoots , trusting them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure  --  was not so much to recapture the past by an almighty concentration on it as to get it going again , on however miniature and distorted a scale , in the visible present . He was constantly fitting us as characters , as he might have hung costumes and masks on us , requiring of us only that we make the costumes wiggle and the masks speak . I think it came as a surprise to all of us how steadily the rhythm of Clem 's work increased while we stayed there . Actually the trip had been conceived as a luxurious escape that we all owed ourselves whether we could afford it or not . We all had a little money saved up from the war . We were at the same time tired and restless . A friend of mine had suggested that Acapulco was attractive and out of the way  --  which at that time it was , though in the course of the summerwe seemed to be visited often enough by other Americans in much the same situation as ourselves except that they were alighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We would run into them downtown in Acapulco in one of the bars or at one of the public beaches . As often as not they would drift out to our house for an evening before they went on their way , always a little curious that we were not taking advantage of our brief vacation to see Mexico . They were answered that it was because Clem and I were working on novels , but the real truth is that only Clem was working well . And we were probably immobilized because he had got his wheel turning faster than even he had foreseen . The rest of us had no heart and finally no wish to interrupt him . Let Mexico look at itself . We would sit and look at ourselves . On the surface of it I should not have been content to stay . My own work  --  my attempt to get started at it  --  was going badly enough . I even toyed with the notion that Clem 's busy presence was sapping the force from what I might have done in other surroundings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear enoughp393now who was the natural and demon-driven writer as between the two of us . And if a great many of his ideas and conceptions were chaff , I was not so foolish as to think that all of them were to be dismissedlightly . It would have taken a real literary factory to carry out all the works he projected then  --  but I half believed he might turn into just such a factory . I would hardly admit it to myself , but the truth is that I was mightily content to see him moving with such surety and speed into the dimensions that I would never attain . Maybe even then I was afraid of going where he was headed . I have no idea of how many pages of his novel he wrote in those weeks we were there . The number was high , but in any case that is no proper measure of what he did . The crucial fact is that in that one freakish burst of energy he conceived or made the major decisions on the poems , fiction and drama that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years before these things , for better or worse , were shaped to their final form . But to count only those intentionsthat were carried through is enough to indicate that this was " such a summer as had never been " in his life . The whole book of poems to be called The Throne of Oedipus announced itself as a by-product of the novel on which he worked so assiduously . Death and the Devil was first shaped in his mind , though at that time he meant to make it a dramatized section in the novel designed to " contain everything . " I had more than one indication that summer that behind a surface of relations apparently candid he was exploiting me as a kind of model to round out his conception of Gerald Potter  --  the tolerant and pimping brother , impotentby his tolerance , more than faintly guilty in his feckless wish that " everything would turn out for the best . " It is true that there had been a day years before when he had thought that he " got " his novel . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catalogues of narrative bits , dialogues , descriptions and not-to-be-labeled fragments which he meant to use . What counts is that there in Mexico he discovered the form in his heap of treasure and scrap . At last he settled on a style and a principle of selection that would obtain until he encountered Plankton . But with his flabbergasting capacity for overdoing everything ( his astonishing ability to overdo , on occasion , what no one else I have known could even get done ) he wanted to depict himself in process of discovering his form . We heard a great deal , at lunch , on thep394beaches , over our beers as we sat commanding the zdcalo , about the astounding interrelationships that he found to exist in a life that was , after all , very much like everyone else 's . ( His was n't , really , but at that time it seemed less different than it would seem later . ) He was obsessed with the notion that he ought to be writing an analytical work , taking his creativity as subject . If only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novel , poems and , probably , a play . There was n't time to write it , so he threw it out in polychrome flashes that we tolerated as clowning . To discover a form , he thought , was to unsettle or dissolve the forms hardened by earlier learning . So , for instance , finding a form for his novel that superseded the one he had been given the day he and Sheila sat on a big granite rock was to find that he had been " given " the novel even before that . Several years , as a matter of fact , before he thought of himself as a writer or even as a potential footballplayer . To discover the way patterns repeated in one 's life was to discover that nothing would ever happen to one that had n't been intended by the very earliest choices . At least from puberty on he had been haunted and very frequently annoyed by a deja vu quality in all his experiences . Take for instance this landscape before his very eyes . ( We were sitting on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had directed us into the yard he had recognized it . As what ? As the Forbidden Land . He was not supposed to come here , though at the same time it was exactly the terrain for which he had always been searching . Even as a very small boy when he used to run up and down along the ditch at the edge of his yard , pretending that the sundown clouds were mountainsand dreaming that he would raise the cash to take his mother or some other girl off to live in them , he had known they would look just like this when he got there . Just these mountains , this beach and the endless ocean beyond . When cautioned that he was going too far , he said , " No sir . It is not I who am going too far . Something has gone too far with me . " " Roll your eyes , Clem , " said Sheila , hugely enjoying his prophetic mood . He did just that , and then announced , " Something terrible is going to happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrible was going to happen everywhere.  | " No sir , " he said . " Only where I am looking . Everything would be all right if I did n't look into it and see the flaw . Le dent , " he said . " I see Baudelaire 's dent and I always have . " Joking aside ( when was it ever ? when was it not ? ) , he wanted his fattening Sheila to know that he had recognized some fated bearer of his earlier experiences in her and in Cecile Potter before he had recognized them as individuals . " Why did n't you tell me that the first night ? " Sheila demanded . " You 'd have thought I was crazy . " " But I did , I did , I did , " she chanted . " See ? That proves what I am saying , " he announced . " I am not the only one who has experienced the power whose law I am at present literarily defining . " If this foolery had about it much that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else to it , too . " I learned things from the Army , " Clem said . And so he had . There was a certain confidentaggressiveness to his apparent whimsicality . It may be that his present success with his novel  --  and he knew he was being successful in just the same way a mother delivering knows that she is successful  --  had also bolstered his confidence to the point where he could believe quite calmly that he had always been a visionarywith powers outside those we are conditioned to think natural . The experiences of his childhood turned out , in the proof of writing , to be exceptionally rich in the meanings he was now co-ordinating in his novel . Did that not mean that he had chosen and undergone these experiences because they would one day turn out to be elementsin the form he was , in this new cycle of progression , creating ? Did he know anything in the animated retrospect of writing about his past that he had not known in the thoughtless events of ten or twenty years before ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw , " he said  --  to our outrage and amusement . " As a child you knew me , but you did n't know it was me you knew , " Sheila mocked him gravely . " That 's right , " he cried eagerly . And we swarmed in with our lighthearted logic while he fought against it like a bull calf tangled in the ropes that will lead him to market . " But you see I know how I was and you do n't ! " he would cry grandly . And we thought that if these mad hypotheses helped himp396with his real work , at least , then they were doing all one could ask of them . We challenged him , of course , to prove his clairvoyance by predictingthe future , any part of it  --  his own future , for example . " Well , now , " he said . " Well , now . I ca n't do this as well as a fortune teller , because their language is designed for it and mine is designed for something else . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's the point . Everything is a matter of language . But I 'll tell you roughly that after having put out my eyes I will wander the earth , poorly led by my dearest daughter , and then I will die in a grove and where I am buried will be holy ground . " The amusement value of this was low . We thought we might as well let the hum of wasps fill the hot hollow of the afternoon . And then he said , " Of course , anyone can claim to be Oedipus , and you think that the real one was H. Warwick Lloyd , as I know . But I will write a book to prove that I am the McCoy . But then , books do n't prove anything . They are a matter of language , but nothing else is . Very well , then . Come on , Sheila . Let 's go prove our reality by killing something . " After the idle arguments of lunchtime had purged him of thoughts or the wish to think , Clem and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clem 's old singleshot .22 . With a pocketful of gold-colored bullets to spend , they trudged into the warm hills behind the house or up the beach in the opposite direction from the Pogorskis ' shack . Clem 's great ambition was to down one of the vultures that he admired so much . Often when we heard the distant crack of his gun it meant that he was lying on his back on the sand firing up vainly into the majesty of the sky . Or sometimes he had led Sheila into a thicket on a hilltop from which he meant to ambush the great birds . He never hit one . But when Sheila and he came sauntering back , looking like twins in their grubbiness , the color of their skin and their sun-faded rags of clothing , he was seldom empty-handed . He brought rabbits , lizards and small birds  --  sometimes a few fish , if they had gone by an inlet or one of the pools in the hills . I think none of this game was ever eaten , and I suppose Clem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edible creatures were apt to lie with the inedible somewhere in the generalp397vicinity of the barn where he worked , until maggots finished them off or a stray dog got them . Once I found a three-foot lizard tacked by its tail to a rafter more or less above Clem 's worktable . " A model ? " I asked . " Do you always work from a model , Mr. Anderson ? " Clem said , " Would n't it stun the hell out of you if I brought it back to life one of these days ? " And I suppose that meant he was working too when he hunted and watched the disintegration of his kills . Destroying for the sake of re-creating quick life in the motionlessnessof art . Needing a model for death  --  a vulture , if possible . Yes , just that . But he had a subordinate motive in this indiscriminate ( though modest ) slaughter of small creatures . He liked to plague our neighbor and sometimes visitor Claude Pogorski . Whatever breathed was holy to Claude , and when he saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fence ( or heard Clem say that he had fired on a doe rabbit running but had probably led her too far ) his whole vocabulary of indignation would ignite , sometimes burning until he claimed to see a connection between this petty slaughter and the monstrosity at Hiroshima . Claude was one of those Poles in whose face one may recognize the white likeness of an Aztec warrior , a face without the meliorating plumpness of the Mediterranean races or even the grossness of urbanization that makes German faces look civilized . He looked like a tribesman from the Far East , a real Steppenwolf . We found some irony in his presence on this coast at the opposite end of the world . The irony of his appearance was enhanced by a thoroughgoing softness of soul . He was a sensitive plant if ever I encountered one . But he had been in the war . He had been a ward attendant in some station hospital and had spent more than a year with it on a miserable island in the South Pacific . He had ministered to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cross hut attached to the hospital . But even these benevolent , noncombatant duties had seemed like a degradation into militaristic aggression . He despised himself for having been a soldier and held a permanentgrudge against the powers that had drafted him and sent him off to take part in their butcher schemes . Sometimes , to hear him talk you would have thought he was a drafted SS man , forced top398take part in the massacres of Lidice or Oradour , instead of the benevolent GI he must have been . I had the distinct impression that Clem baited him into some of his self-accusing , world-accusing tirades  --  perhaps using Claude to refresh his memory of what he himself had talked like in college . Neither Claude nor his wife , Venetia , had been much out of Brooklyn before the war . Claude had studied art at the Brooklyn Museum . he had won student prizes for his work and later had been shown by one of the reputable galleries in Manhattan before he was drafted . After he was discharged from the Army in 1944 " for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a teaching job in New York and the prospect of increasing note as a painter . Could have  --  if it had not been for the iron of guilt and antimilitarism festering in his soul . Claude and Venetia had been political since their cradle days . As a matter of fact , they had met  --  at ages eight and six , respectively  --  when their parents took them to a Communist picnic up the river from New York . While they were in grade school they had marched with tiny red banners demanding freedom for Tom Mooney and after puberty they had thought of themselves as professionals of the revolution . Throughout the Thirties , guided at first by their families , they had sifted through the meshes that separated extreme leftist factions . They became Trotskyites , then splinter Trotskyites , then splinter-splinter , and so on until there was merely a two-family enclave of Pogorskis and Smilens banded together in the true faith , considering all Brooklyn around them as the enemy camp of reaction or traitors to the true cause . We said sometimes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Claude defined his politics , that he and Venetia considered even their parents to be inclined either to capitalist greed or to Stalinoid repression . Claude 's discharge from the Army had come as a consequence of firing a .45 slug through the hut of his commanding officer . No doubt this was a decent action , considering the character of that man as Claude saw it : " Pure Southern fascist . He denied the enlisted men everything and diverted the patients ' ration of fresh eggs to the officers ' mess . He was responsible for the death of three patients because he refused to let the doctors set up a quarantine ward for our diphtherias . Set a trap for a Negro boy in the nurses ' quarters , meant to machine-gun the boy when he came . Forced the nurses into whoring with the island brass . Humiliated doctors who 'd been onp399the university staffs at Michigan and Louisiana . Wanted to chain the psycho patients . Claimed that psychiatry was a Jewish fraud . " One thinks that if the Army put such a man in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have been removed by a conscientious citizen soldier with an issue pistol . Claude had stalked him all one evening , from the officers ' club to the nurses ' quarters and to his own hut  --  and then had missed the great opportunity by firing wildly from a range of fifty yards . " I should have been inside waiting for him , " Claude said . That he was not court-martialed for his attempt was due , in a fairly direct sense , to the C.O. 's undisguised anti-Semitism . The hospital psychiatrist and the board of psychiatrists that was finally convened from all over the island bore some resentment for having been labeled a " bunch of kike phonies . " They did not find Claude responsible for his deed  --  and in fact wrote a report that cast some doubt on the mental fitness of the C.O.Which , taking it all in all , represented a degree of triumph for Claude . But he refused to admit that poetic justice was justice . ( Clem , whose obsession it was to seize upon single words or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , delighting in the complex of meaning concealed beneath their superficial simplicities , made much of Claude 's objection to poetic justice . At last Clem concluded that only justice courte deserved the name of poetic justice , and what is usually called poetic justice is an antipoetic fraud . ) As Claude saw it , he should never have fired  --  or he should not have missed . He was not one to leave either justice or mercy to the hand of God . All the unjustly slain , from Abel on , cried ceaselessly on the name Pogorski . In the second or third week of our acquaintance he began to ride his bike into our yard on almost any day . Usually he came late in the afternoon , for he scrupulously respected our working hours and it would never have occurred to him that he had any right to intercept Clem on his way out to slay God 's little creatures with his Crackshot .22 . No , Claude would not interfere , but he meant to await the returninghunter as a hellfire preacher would await the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps carrying a rabbit , a lizard , or whatever  --  Claude would launch , with friendly anxiety , into his picture of " the web of life . " At about the same time his parents let fall on his infant ears Marx'sp400theory of surplus value , it had come to Claude that insects depended on plant life , plant life depended on insects , and birds , those worthies of the air , depended on both . Nature might be red in fang and claw . No doubt it was . But there were niceties in the way nature adjusted balances between eaters and eaten , harmonies that only perverse man could destroy . Claude drew , I must say , an appealing and artful picture of the natural kingdom , just as he drew an appealing picture of human society when the state should have withered away . He did not deny that if the lion and the lamb lay down together the lion was very apt to eat the Iamb when hunger moved him . But he could discern the smile of innocence on the leonine chops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could say , In la sua volontade e nostra pace . To man , who broke the peace , he could only offer the hope that reason might someday return him to his place in the natural kingdom . But , Clem said  --  Clem unshaven and dirty , Clem swinging his useless trophies of the hunt like the stupidest young hunter from Boda , Clem spilling down his chin the Bohemia beer that Sheila would have fetched him from the cooler when she saw that Claude had buttonholed him and meant to have an answer  --  but what if man 's destined and ordained place in the web of life was to be the perverse animal ? Reason , Claude spoke of reason , but was n't reason itself the symptom or even the springboard of perversity ? Of course it was a different thing to peer through machined gun sights at a rabbit than to stalk it barefoot and barehanded , and it was a different thing to fire-bomb a city of strangers than to break a zebra 's back from instinct . But was it not indeed conceivable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harmoniously expressed by what Claude called the perversities of state and war ? Listening to the two of them , I used to marvel at the undress informality of their arguments , but marvel also to note the neoclassicismthat Claude  --  and God knows what of his own experience  --  had brought out in Clem . Pope in undress , I thought , half expectinghim to belt Claude with a quote from An Essay on Man . Borgias or Catilines or atom bombs  --  an Augustan would not say they broke the great design , but only that Claude was a victim of perniciousenthusiasm . Nonetheless  --  I worried about this and I worry still  --  Claude was serious . Clem had merely assumed a position , as if he could have none of his own.  |p401On  Thursdays Claude usually brought us a mimeographed newssheet , sent out from Brooklyn by whichever faction of ex-Communistsit was that he considered the least contaminated . ( They would not , of course , seem pure to him . They would be rendered suspect by the very taint of organization that could have assembled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweat over the mailing . ) The wonder was that from this tiny newssheet  --  in wordage it compared to the New York Times as a clod compares to a mountain  --  Claude could read so much that no Times reader would ever suspect . He read it as if it were a condensed code  --  or was like the work Clem wanted to do , made up altogether of titles . Claude knew what followed all the titles , and if we did n't he told us . China , he said , had been double-crossed by the American generals unleashed at the death of ( that reactionary capitalist and doubledealer ) Roosevelt . The airlifting of Chiang 's troops into Shanghai and the supplies of American arms turned over to him was so cynical a betrayal that the Communists were bound to retaliate by building armies in Manchuria and Korea . The people ( always , always ! ) were in the nutcracker . The Baruch plan for atomic control was such a barefaced attempt to perpetuate the American monopoly on atomic weapons that Russianacceptance of it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secretary of Commerce Wallace , who opposed the Baruch plan , was a notoriously softheaded muddler who , if given his way , would turn over all of Europe to the commissars . In spite of the million-times-repeated promises made as recently as a year ago , the United States would rebuild Germany as a dominant military and economic power in Europe . France would not for very much longer maintain her position as a mediator between East and West , but would plop solidly into a Western military alliance , while in the French colonies there had been a runaway massacre ( hardly reported in the capitalist press ! ) of natives in Madagascar . The Vichy admirals were preparing to double-cross the new governments in Paris and Indochina and reconquer that country . Russia was busily undermining the coalition governments in Rumania , Hungary , Czechoslovakia , Bulgaria and Austria . There was going to be a long , fierce fight for the oil of the Middle East . Colonel Schwarzkopf 's coup in Iran was only the first big-power move in that area . The English would play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of oil , and Palestine was likely to be stamped out in the process . There would be no disarmament . Though no navy in the world could conceivably challenge the American fleets , the American Navy would be expanded and modernized . The staggering budget for arms that we had considered an emergency measure through the war years would be dwarfed by peacetime military expenditures . ( In a choked voice Pogorski said , " Do you know how much they 'll spend on silver service alone for the new ships ? The czars never dreamed of such ostentation and waste . " ) Listening to all these predictions that seemed so dire in those days , I sometimes thought that Pogorski was among us like a spreader of the plague . It 's not easy for people just home from a war to hear that , willy-nilly , they are in the midst of a continuing one . Especially it is hard when one is out of his home country , deprived of the common opiates that help us believe our geese are swans . A time may come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one feels an obligation to " do something . " When I was sure that Clem was leading Pogorski on to paint the world 's prospects in the blackest of colors ( including predictions that by 1960 there would be somewhere an arsenal of rockets with atomic warheads capable of blotting out life on earth ) I grew anxious for all our sakes , lest we should use this pessimism as an excuse for slackening our work that seemed now only well begun . God knows I used to spend mornings , when I might have been working on my novel , worrying about what Claude had said the evening before , goingto lunch with nothing but a bad conscience and half a page of hasty dialogue to show for the hours spent in my study . But I think that Clem was only using his talks with Claude for ballast . There was a time of day when Claude was likely to be there  --  maybe re-creating for Clem the pessimism he had felt in 1939 . But Clem could now swallow the poisonous predictions with a detachmentthat said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the last six years , then of course it must follow that we will do the terrible things you predict . He was learning to enjoy and use what made Pogorski suffer so . It amounts to something as good and as awful as that , and even then I guessed that hardness of heart in the face of the event might be the curse ordained for those with responsible imaginations . Nothing surprises them into adequate pity or adequate charity.  |p403He  led Pogorski on , as if Pogorski were persuading him of somethingby citing reasons unknown . And from the beginning there was not the slightest chance that Pogorski could persuade him of anything . After weeks of Pogorski 's fond attempts , Clem said to him with facile cruelty , " You are n't going to ever change this wicked world , Claude , and you ought to know that . You missed the colonel . That was the task the ages had been preparing you for . And you missed . You wo n't get another chance . " Unhappily Claude was shrewd enough to guess that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's missionary visits , Clem was pepped up as if Pogorski 's message had been a tonic . He took it like bad medicine needed to tone him up for tomorrow 's work on the novel , but as if it had no pertinence beyond that for the world in which he and the lizards did what they must according to their respective natures . He was more interested in talking about the coming fall and his personal career , though these things too were clearly subordinate to the main , reckless drive of his writing . He had been offered a teaching job . During the war Felix Martin had become head of the English department at a good university in Kansas . He wanted Clem to come as instructor . Clem wrote back accepting the job , and when he talked to me about it I was at first conned into the belief that he seriously meant to take it . Sheila was opposed . She knew Clem well enough to know that he would be unhappy with the snail 's pace of an academic community . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live on the GI Bill , " she insisted . " If you want this child to call you Daddy , you 've got to live up to him . We 're not going to wait until you 're forty for anyone to hear of you . If you want to teach , wait a few years . Something better will come along . " But he did n't want to teach  --  except in the general sense that he wanted to do everything . Of course , I should n't minimize that . There was something forever embittered in his nature because he had to inhabit just one skin . In sum , however , he had never really believed he would live up to his contract with Felix . It was a position he took , from which he sucked the goody , caring more about what might have happened to him ( for that was potentiallyusable in his book ) than about what would . Basically he was far shrewder than Sheila in calculating the ad/vantages and necessities of succeeding as a writer . Odd , remote or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New York before the war , he had nevertheless seen enough of how careers are made to understand the importance of being near the fountainheads of power in the literary world . If he had to be an upstart crow , then clearly it was better to be one where upstarting would be noticed  --  resented and fought , if that was what it would come to . He was the more eager to compete as his novel satisfied him more . It would n't hurt to be in New York , where he could talk to Nathaniel Bentley now and then . It was always worth while talking to Bentley . And Bentley had connections . Lillian Esterman had been heard from again . She was married to a refugee with money , and she had plans for a magazine that would naturally welcome Clem as a contributor . There might be a place for him on the editorial staff . Clem 's friend Henderson Paul had brought out a successful war novel in the previous spring . From a peak of good feeling he had written to Clem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manuscript if , for any reason , Gordon and Maxwell did not offer him a royal advance . These conversations among us that always seemed to turn to the excitement of Clem 's prospects naturally increased my professional uncertainty . The wish to write fiction was dying hard in me , but dying . The false spring of relief that came when the war was over had brought me back to trying a novel I had given up years before . For the sake of the novel , I should have stayed away from Clem . I was beginning to see much too clearly that I did n't want to shoot lizards and hang their smelly carcasses over my desk as Clem did . Even if I had been willing to do it , the crazy hope that someday the lizard would live again  --  with a life I could give it  --  was lacking in me . I might have finished the novel and I might have sold it . But day by day I found myself less able to believe in it . So , with considerable inner crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work on some critical articles . When Clem found out that I had done so he reacted ( 1 ) as though I had deserted him on the firing line , and ( 2 ) as though I had finally come to my senses and followed a course he had known all along was more suited to my arid talents . I resented his attitude on both counts , of course . One afternoon as we were walking home from town , we had it out.  |p405We  had been swimming in the rollers of the afternoon beach east of town . Clem had made us late by dallying to eat some of the clams that diving boys brought in superbly fresh from the offshore rocks . Since company was expected for dinner  --  a touring couple named Benson , as I remember  --  I was annoyed by his irresponsibility in this small circumstance and then angered by his implication that he had a right to it , being more responsible in his work than I. " Responsible , hell , " I said . " You 're just lucky . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have to do is close your little baby hand around it now . " " Everything I wanted , " he said morosely , flinging a stick at one of the large spider webs hung like a sail between palm fronds on the roadside . " What you want is n't separated by so much time from when you want it . Hell , what I have now is what I wanted in college . " " So be thankful . " He shook his head . " It 's hard to feel myself here with it . The way you are . The way all the rest of you are . I could run , run , run sometimes when I get to thinking . When I 'm not actually working , I 'm scared . It 's so far from what I am as a being . " " The more to be pitied , " I said , " for your Midas touch . " " It is like being Midas , " he said immodestly . " I made a mistake . I should have stayed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Nor I , " I said , thinking sorely of the novel I would never finish . " It 's different with you . With you it 's a reasonable choice . Yousimply quit . " " Yeah . " " I 'm not allowed to quit . You know , I think sometimes I did n't come back from the war . Like when you 're a child you cross the road in front of a truck racing toward you , and when you get across you think , It got me and I do n't know it . ' Well , in the war I went outside  --  it was because of what I wanted  --  and I ca n't really get back in where I could make choices like you . I could n't give up my novel just because I decided to . " " Holy , holy , holy . " " It 's true . I 'll never be able to touch anything again . Not Sheila or the kid , or  --  " " Or clams and tequila and rock candy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never saw such a glutton . So now go home and have the big dinner and knock off a piece and feel sorry for your/self . Clem , there were people who really did n't come home from the war . " I do n't feel sorry for them , " he said . He threw another stick into the purple tropic shadows . " Yes , I do . That 's part of why I 'm willing to go on working  --  for everybody that lives and dies , even if I ca n't do it myself . I admit I ca n't have a life of my own now . . . " " Because your nuts were sawed off . Hi , Jake Barnes . " " . . . but I want to be a healer , to make everything all right for  --  " "  --  us ! Clem , what are you doing ? Are you writing a manifesto or talking to me ? Cry to me across this bitter air . " Suddenly he planted his feet in the road and would go no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Go on back and tell the ladies what The Wings of the Dove means . It 's so easy ! " I kept walking for a minute , then turned and shouted back at him . For five minutes we roared back and forth at each other , using only the two all-expressive words we had learned in the war years to encompassand reduce all meaning to the level of expletive . We made a subhuman comedy routine of it , particularly grating and grotesque in the lulling Pacific silence around us and the tranquil sundown . Then I walked stiffly home , determined to head for the border in the morning , and Clem went back to town to finish getting drunk . In explaining to our guests his absence from dinner , we used the simplest banal jokes about the temperament of the artist , and in usingthem I tried to reduce the episode to something merely insignificant . Sheila would not hear of our going to look for him . And , sure enough , he came rolling into our place some hours later in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not been with him . In the morning there was no hint from any of us that there had even been a quarrel . But the substance of it , the essential mystery of who should envy whom , had been revealed to consciousness as mystery . He never took me as seriously afterward , I think . Against the drag of my own stubbornness , I took him more so . The morning after that shouting match he was badly hung over . From the nature of that hangover I got a confirming insight into the price he was paying ( and was to go on paying in hypochondria and delicacy of balance ) for his good fortune as artist . His hangovers seldom appeared in the form of headaches or nausea or loss of appe/tite , but , rather , in a sense of precariousness almost metaphysical . They spoke to him like the sermons of Jeremy Taylor , insisting on the frailty of the spark that animates this clay of ours . It was as if the very denial of pain in head or gut were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the body like Diogenes in search of one honest nerve that would report a pain to prove that life was still going on . That morning I found him in the yard below the house with his thumb on the pulse in his neck . He was rigid and staring out to sea . He had not moved when the shade grew scanter . The sun was blazingfull on his back . A beer would help , I suggested . " It cools the blood , it cools the brain . " " No ! " He did n't really turn to notice me , but there was such an anguish of supplication in his tight posture that I brought him a beer anyway , and a few aspirins . Before he would take them he asked in absolute seriousness what the human pulse rate ought to be . Around eighty , I told him , though I had read somewhere that Robinson Jeffers had a pulse of forty in the morning . " Mine is ninety-one , " he said in grief and anxiety . " Ninety-two . " His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had put in his hand , but he would not trust himself to sip it until I had explained that my pulse frequently rattled a hundred to the minute after I had been drinking . At this he drank the whole bottle , relaxing visibly , like a dampened paper doll . Wiping his mouth , he said , " That Jeffers is the luckiest man alive . " I believe he saw his pulse in the image of a little hammer chipping away at the rock of life . On another occasion Sheila came running for Janet and me , insistingthat I drive into town for the doctor . " Clem lost consciousness , " she said . He was , as a matter of fact , sitting at the table in the barn where he typed  --  looking vital enough , shamefully energetic  --  when I had brought the doctor and we were all gathered around him . The good , calm doctor refused to be impressed by Clem 's account of the attack . He told Clem that aside from a blood pressure slightly below the average , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " A little fellow like you should n't try to drink up all the alcohol in Mexico . Now , if you lost consciousness for a moment , thatp408is nothing to worry about . That is only nature 's way of returning you to the cradle of life . Sometimes the consciousness obliges the body to go beyond its strength , and you ought to be grateful when the blind process of unconscious life takes over . " To which Clem said later , darkly , " He does n't know . I have n't got as much unconsciousness left as most people . If I was n't watchingit all the time , it would go out . " What would go out ? Well , it . Whatever it was he thought of as life , I suppose . I was always impressed by the way he could get over his attacks of hangover or hypochondria ( and once , to all appearances , he healed himself of an attack of food poisoning that kept the rest of us out of commission for two days and more ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his condition and , conversely , he could be made physically ill by being interrupted before he was ready to quit for the day . For an example of swift recovery let me point out that on the morning when I gave him the beer and aspirin , his mind was already churning productively by the time the beer had uncurled his toes . Out of the hangover ( he used everything ) he was beginning to composea war story that he would call " Hangover . " It had to do , he said , with his voyage home , when the troopship came upon a floating mine . For more than an hour the unescorted ship had circled it , firing the five-inch gun , the three-inch gun , the forty-millimeter and the twenties . Finally the troops began to fire carbines and tommy guns in an effort to dispose of this floating remnant of the war . " They could n't sink it , " Clem said , with a malicious note of knowledgeability in his voice . " We sailed away and left it floating . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the story would be to reverse subjectivity and object , ve-e-e-e-ery delicately shifting the languageuntil the reader thinks the blue sea is his own blue eyes and that the dynamite mine is really floating inside ' em . " He was jumping in his chair as if he had been wired in when he finished telling me this . " So go write it , " I said . " You do n't mind if I write ? " he asked with a caustic edge to his voice . I did n't answer , and that was all there was to patching up our quarrel of the night before . But after he had trudged down to his barn to work , I sat in the chair he had occupied , staring out at our Pacific . And of course I was thinking of that figurative mine his storyp409suggested . He had made me believe it existed , floating at large in the blue , all-seeing , biding distances  --  internalized but nonetheless malignant , a hazard to navigation left over from the war . And it seemed to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's brand of despair . Nothing I had of faith kept me from believing that the world had been poisoned like a poisoned well . But of the four of us who were preparing through this summer to go back to our cold-war lives , it was Sheila who eventually caught the virus from Pogorski most seriously . Maybe because she was pregnant , but more likely because of the straight-grained honesty of her character , she came strongly to believe that " something has to be done " about the public iniquities that Pogorski sketched for us . She began to intrude Claude 's arguments into our lunchtime or evening talk . Clem accused her of waiting for her shot in the arm when we were expecting Claude to come with his weekly bulletin from Brooklyn , or of going for her " vitamins " when she went down the beach to the shack where the Pogorskis lived . " Not that exactly . But what 's the use of what you 're doing  --  of having children !  --  unless there 's going to be some kind of decent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what had sustained her duringthe war had been the optimism of her boss , a China expert in the War Department who had liked to talk about " TVA 's on the Yellow River " and " a thousand years of peace . " Word had come to us during the summer that this man had been picked out by a New York journalistas a fellow traveler of the Communists and had been forthwith excluded from the government . Sheila was taking this hard  --  and as all too explicit confirmation of Pogorski 's predictions . " There 's no use being alive , " Clem told her , evading her passionateconcern , withdrawing his mental energies from the grim disintegrationshe predicated , like a cat cleaning its paws before it retires to curl in the sun . And it seemed more than a little unfair that he should have a fictional world and his work to retire into while he left her outside and , as it were , unsheltered . For though she was reading his manuscript approvingly as it advanced , still she was excluded from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for a while , I thought that Sheila 's emotional involvement with Claude was verging into something more than a shared politicalp410passion . When he sat with us , it was to Sheila that he more and more frequently turned for support . The nods she gave to his indignant denunciations were far too gentle , I thought , to have been elicited by the substance of his protest . More and more often she went by herself down the beach to the Pogorskis ' when Janet was bored with them or wanted to read or had somewhere else to go . This in itself was innocent enough . Claude painted in a thatched shed behind their shack . The shed consisted merely of a roof supported by poles . If Claude sat down with Sheila when she arrived , they were both clearly visible , even from our place . Besides , Venetia was always there , though she did not always join the couple in the shed when Sheila arrived . To look at Venetia you would have thought that her appearance alone would have kept Claude 's affections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style was that plump , hot comeliness we used to admire in Italian movie actresses . She had a stridently powerful thorax on which the large breasts stood with remarkably little sag . ( There is a figure by Maillol called " Action in Chains " which indecently resembles Venetia as she was . ) Her belly was ridged with muscle just above the mons , and her wide pelvis made one feel that she could have carried a minotaur in that bushel-sized shell of bone . Her columnar legs winked dimples around and above her kneecaps . Her pale skin had a tendency to burn and peel , so after she had been in the sun she looked faintly raw . For all the political dismay she shared with Claude , she was characteristically quiet , sittingat the fringe of our talk with what we called a " spayed-cat " smile on her face . ( We did n't mean the epithet . Clem and I meant , indeed , the opposite , thinking it rather a smile of righteous pride in her bodily secrets . ) It seemed reasonable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outletsof painting and politics to burn his energy would be not at all likely to invite the attentions of another woman . And it never occurredto me that what I was noticing was the slow preliminary to an affair . For Sheila that would have been unthinkable  --  if she had been able to think of what she was doing . Yet there was something in the very atmosphere of those long hot days that seemed to invite vagrancy of the soul . When you looked at the shadows and felt the blaze of the sky or heard the absolute repeti/tion of surf boom  --  out of forever , into forever  --  you felt how much time there was , as if the sun said , There is time for every sin and every repentance . Insidiously the light promised that it would not fail , that it would go on showering its benison on whatever the senses demanded . I think it likely that I projected a part of the erotic coloring which I saw in Sheila 's visits to the Pogorskis . I used to sit in semifrustrationat my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thatched roof . It was like watching a microscopic puppet play for which the heat working in my own loins supplied the script  --  might have supplied a dialogue of love , of proposition , if I had allowed it to . There they were : the tall , restless man before his shrill canvases , picturesque and more than picturesque in the white native trousers he habitually wore , a mat of fierce blond hair on his lean chest , she , feeling her body enriched with pregnancy , satisfied with the satisfaction that demands to be multiplied , that makes the rich vulnerable to desire as the poor can never be . And around them the aura of encouragementspread by that fleshy Venus who lies abed inside the shack , nude , stretching her arms and smiling about what she knows , and who may silently speak to them in the same language and with the same amoral intent as the sea beating on the other side . No , I did not think Sheila and Claude were verging toward an affair , but I fretted to think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very fact that what was begun with Claude had never been consummated . As it turned out , my intimations were beside the mark , but I owe to them and their erotic tint a comprehension of what Sheila and Claude sought in their familiarity . The scales fell from my eyes and I knew . What did their love talk come around to ? What subject made their eyes glow softly when they sat close to each other on the bench in Claude 's unwalled studio or ambled back toward our place gesturing in the emptiness of light ? Clem . " You know , Claude has a terrible crush on Clem , " Sheila said to me eventually , with a veiled , crooked look , as though she meant to hide something by this partial revelation and pick my brains . At least find out if I had guessed their secret . ( I had n't quite . She gave it away . ) " I do n't mean it 's sexual , " she hurried to add . ( A little too late.  |p412At  least I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see that the sexual element was fused oddly into this abstract love . ) " Do you mean it 's better or worse than if it were sexual ? " I asked . She ignored the question as unanswerable and perhaps beside the point . " It 's more that he admires Clem so much , expects so much of him . I think he really suffers to see that Clem is n't more concerned about things , that Clem can seem so lighthearted . " " Why does n't he simply believe that Clem is irresponsible and live with that belief ? " She shook her head , impatient with my heavy-footed ironies . " It 's that Claude is . . . sensitive . " I laughed at the word , so unavoidable in describing Claude . It was a cliche that took its revenge for our general scorn by appearing here as the mot juste . " He feels what Clem could be , " she said . As if to show how considerable were the obstacles to such a per= ception , just at that moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then we heard him " trying words " aloud , as he not infrequentlydid . " I spit on you . I spih-ut on you , ' " he sang . " Obviously a trifler and vulgarian , " I said of him . " Sheila , Clem 's seldom been known to undervalue himself . I do n't think he needs Claude to persuade him of what he might be . The other night on the road he propagandized me on how he meant to save the world , be a more-than-poet healer and all that . " Such a look on her face ! She could not have looked so caught in nakedness if I had found her actually lying in Claude 's embrace . And by this limitless embarrassment I finished smelling out the indulgenceshe and Claude shared . I had trapped her with a metonym for that word which she and Claude must actually , in the license of their admiration , have used in speaking of Clem 's potentiality : Savior ! I ca n't say how deeply touched I was ( and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at any rate I dared not inquire any further at the risk of profaning those real-unreal intimations that Sheila and Claude had , with greater innocence , sounded . I know I was choked with emotion for a time , wanting to laugh at them for their childishness , wanting to laugh to rid myself of the oppressive awe I felt ( not for Clem , as they did , but for that immanence and power they had known how to see personified in him ) .  |p413Matter-of-factly  I said , " Clem has to shut off certain distractions or he could n't cope with a sustained demand from his work . It 's all right for Claude to stew about the atomic bomb if he wants to . Right now , Clem has other fish to fry . If he has something to say politically , his time will come . " " I do n't think so , " she said . " Clem 's so strong , but so terribly weak at the same time . " Her manner had again become the oblique evasivenessof someone with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a vision . " They 'll always find ways to keep him penned . We will . Dick , I find myself doing it all the time , just by being what he loves . I want to turn him loose . " " Loose ? Mankind can not stand very much Clem Anderson . " " Do n't joke . Claude thinks  --  Well , we 've talked about whether I ought n't leave Clem . " " So Claude could marry him ? " I knew that was n't it , was n't fair to the elusive and irrational purpose of their devotions . But it would have been intolerable to encourage their madness merely because it might be tinged with superhuman grace . " That 's idiotic , " I said . Mournfully she shook her head in agreement . " You 're good for him , Sheila . It may always be your function to protect him from enthusiasms like Claude 's instead of . . . I do n't know . But would n't it be a shame for Clem to burn himself up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think he would . Any more . He 's become canny in a way that Claude will never be . " " I know , " she said dutifully , as if she were letting it go at that . As if such a tangle of fanaticisms could be discarded so offhandedly ! No , the irrational dialectic had to throw its coils around our uncertain feet until there was a heroic resolution , or a fatal one perhaps . There was a nearly fatal stop to this queer business one Sunday while Janet and I were away from the house with the Bensons . We had driven inland to see an Indian village . Because Clem had a hangoverand would not get out of bed , we left him and Sheila behind . When Clem eventually got up , he was sullen and fragile , feeling his pulse and trying hopefully to belch . He began to smoke too much , weighing each cigarette as if it were , like arsenic , a deadly poison that might save a life in special circumstances . He had just lain down on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a blanket , when Venetia and Claude walked intop414the yard with a picnic lunch and two bottles of tequila in a sack . Venetia also had her guitar slung on her shoulder . Some time ago Claude had mentioned a fresh-water pool beyond the ridge , in the jungle . It was his inspiration that they might all go there for a picnic and a swim . Clem was rude enough about the invitation at first . He wanted to lie under the blanket until he had strength enough to go down to the barn and revitalize himself with his work . But to please Sheila he let himself be talked into going along . He drank a bottle of beer to beef up his strength for the hike and also filled a canteen with it and slung it on his belt . The pool turned out to be farther by almost a mile than Claude had said . There was some considerable climbing to get there . " I could tell how awful Clem felt , " Sheila said later , " because he kept insisting that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to idle back home on account of my precarious condition . He kept feeling himself all over and had that pleading look in his eyes . " By the time they reached the pool Clem had drunk the beer in his canteen , but was feeling even worse . While they were all changing into their bathing suits  --  Claude made such fun of the girls for wanting to go into the brush for this that they changed together in the open sun  --  Clem did n't even look at Venetia . " By which you know how he felt , " Sheila said , " considering all the things he 's had to say about her . And I must declare the sight is even more than you 'd ex-pect . " However he felt , he extended himself so far as to wade out on the rocks in the shallower water , splashing himself and making a few halfhearted pretenses that he was not only swimming but enjoying it . He kept announcing to Claude , who was a much better swimmer than he and who had already swum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't be responsible for him today , because of his condition  --  awarning by which everyone was reasonably amused . The food Venetia had prepared was ample and good . Among a profusion of feminine talents , she prided herself on making special delicacies out of the cheapest of local foods . Avocados and lime sauce , cevici and corn bread can be a wondrous luxury and , supplementedwith a limited amount of tequila , can be healing to the worst hangover . So when they had eaten at leisure Clem really seemed to feel better , but again announced that they would be fools to swim , " since we all feel so lousy . "  |p415After  lunch Sheila dozed . Claude sat with knotted brows , tossing bits of shale at the nibbling edge of the water . Clem lay near Venetia'sknees while she played her guitar and sang to him . Embracing the guitar and touching the strings in her lap as if she were congratulatingher genitals with a fond patting , she had the air of a carnivorousplant swallowing a matchbox . On two sides of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low wall of volcanic rock that dropped to the water . The shadows of foliage were lambent blue , gold and green , chuckling with birds and whispering full of secret movements . Generous and fecund . Cool enough , even though the day was hot . On the side of the pool opposite the picnickers a single , flawed slab of stone ( " Gethsemane-red " as Clem described it ) rose a hundred feet or more from an underwater rubble of black , like the decayed root of an immensetooth . The fourth side was a piling of fractured boulders , commonenough on that coast subject to earthquakes . The water was almost perfectly transparent , except that in its extremedepths it seemed to assume a kind of colorless darkness like that which one imagines to be the color of outer space . A number of trees had fallen into the water . In the course of time their leaves and smaller branches had been dissipated so they lay stark , projectingtheir thornlike shadows onto the sandy bottom or losing them in the inane of the greater depths . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a view of wastelandrocks across less than eighty yards of water . None of them could quite recollect afterward how Clem and Claude began to argue . It is sufficient to say that their conflicting positionswere well enough established by now . What was the right thing for a man to do in this postwar world ? Oppose it or hope ( on thin enough grounds ) that it might be redeemed from within ? No doubt the pond by which they lay had its influence on the course of their argument . " If Walden is a good book and reading it is a good thing and I wanted to promote the good , I would favor making a movie of it , " Clem said . " With Gary Cooper as strong , silent Henry Thoreau , Misunderstood of Concord , Mass . And a cast of thousands to represent the people he 's misunderstood by , but who , in the triumphantfinale , turn to a love of nature in the raw and all run out to Walden Pond flinging their clothes in the air as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least promote the cause of conservationand many would buy the book . "  |p416Venetia  chuckled softly over her guitar , crooning , " Hi , said the little , leather-winged bat . I 'll tell you the reason that . . " Claude , Indian-rigid , tormented and impatient , sprinkled salt on his left hand in the crotch of thumb and the forefinger that had once pulled a trigger in mortal earnest . Clem went on baiting him . " I see a scene in which Cooper makes his famous plea for Captain John Brown  --  collage shots of Lionel Barrymore ( whiskered , and the wind machine blowing his beard in Ethel Brown 's eyes ) , patting a nigger boy on the head  --  while all Concord cries , Commie ! ' except for Ralph Waldo Emerson , who says , I never yet met a man I did n't like . ' And there 's Bette Davis as Harriet Beecher Stowe , who is hoping to plant a few roses on the Waldencabin . At the finale you could have the Pasadena Glee Club singingBallad for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cabinet of Franklin Dee , played by Spencer Tracy . That way you 've got the whole paideuma on one life raft , Claude . We can march into the future lightly loaded , Claude . " " You make us laugh , " Claude said . " At your service . " " But you 're not a fool . Why wo n't you talk to me ? " " I 'm talking to you , " Clem said idly , trying to peer under Venetia 's lowered eyelids . She ripped the jangling strings of the guitar and said , " Clem 's talking to you , honey . Nothing 's going to be settled today . " One thinks it would have been so easy to take her advice . They were all friends , really very dear to each other . Surely there was an imperative commanding idleness in the sweet , hot afternoon breeze raising its thunderheads out over the ocean . But Clem said , " How can I talk seriously to anyone who takes the attitude you do about killing bunny rabbits , Claude ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your best when you go around slaughtering things . Pretending to be the white man with the gun . Bang , bang . Life is holy . " " Not unless death is , " Clem said . Lying on his back he swung his arm to catch a grasshopper bending a stalk of grass under its weight . Deliberately he began picking the legs off it . Then the wings . He tossed the stripped thorax into the water . " Oh , " Venetia said throatily . " Why 'd you do that ? " " Because he can , " Claude said . " Only because he can . He 's so proud of his power to do in grasshoppers. "  | " You ca n't make an omelet without breaking eggs , " Clem said . " I do n't want to waste my breath talking to someone who likes to chatterabout politics and ca n't stand pulling the legs off a grasshopper . Did you kill anybody in the war , Claude ? I killed somebody . " " And are suffering for it , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That 's why you wo n't let yourself be honest . " " I 'm honest . And why should n't I suffer ? " " Glib , glib , glib , glib , " Claude said . " How you have the gall to bring a child into a world like this when you wo n't seriously concern yourself  --  " " I 'm not bringing the child . God left a little baby among our roses , that 's all . " " Funny . Ha ha . Because you do n't think I 'm worth talking to . " " It is n't that , Claude , " Venetia said wearily . " Why do n't both of you swim ? I 've never heard either of you sound so stupid . " But when Sheila awoke a while later the two men were still harassingthe question of children put abroad in the pain and evil of such a world . It was Sheila 's impression that they were by this time both equally but not overwhelmingly drunk . Oppressed by the twang of hostility in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change the subject . Clem said nastily that he was willing if Claude would let go his ear . He put his head in Sheila 's lap and began to sing folk songs with the girls . Claude continued to drink , muttering to himself . He began to pace up and down the rock shelf in front of the pool . The others paid no attentionuntil suddenly he dived in . Clem lifted his head and said uneasily , " Should n't swim while drinking . " " He 's a good swimmer . It 'll cool him off , " Venetia said . She did not even turn to look at Claude . He took off with a hard , clumsy crawl , heading straight across the pool . He was past the middle when Clem became convinced that he was in trouble . He had been watching out of the corner of his eye , and when he raised his head to look squarely he saw that on every second or third stroke Claude was sinking a foot or two beneath the surface . Getting to his feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " For heaven 's sake , " Venetia said . " Do n't be so antsy , Clem . " But little by little she was getting alarmed too.  |p418Now  Claude was making hardly any forward progress . He was less than fifty feet from the glaring rock wall on the far side of the water , but his strokes were unmistakably impotent with fatigue , and his face  --  they could see it plainly enough when he came to the surface after each floundering  --  showed no sign of consciousness . They were sure he did not hear them yelling . " He 's finished the whole bottle of tequila , " Venetia said . " Oh , that fool . " Clem put his thumb to his throat to see how his pulse was responding . ( " I could see myself from the outside , " he said later . " If I had n't stopped to feel my pulse I would n't have been shamed into doing anything at all . " ) There was a moment when Claude seemed to have given up . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shadow area of the depths below the big tooth of rock . Then , very , very slowly his arms and legs began to move again with the boneless fluency of plant tendrils animated by a current . He surfaced a few yards away from the sheer rock wall and blindly swam to it . It seemed to the watchers there was nothing he could possibly cling to on that side . It was too sheer and water-slicked . But they saw him hang there nevertheless . ( " Like watching a barnacle trying to suck itself onto a metal plate , " Clem said . ) The three of them started to run around the pool toward him then . They scrambled over the juggle of boulders and climbed the overhang . Actually there was no way for them to climb down its face and they had nothing to lower that he might catch hold of . They were only trying to get as close as possible to him , thinking if they could get him to hear he might be able to take care of himself . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they saw him let go his hold and begin to swim toward the center again  --  that horrid , subfetal , plaintive flutter aiming at nothing . Later Clem would accuse himself of not having gone into the water immediately when he knew Claude was in danger . The fact remains that he did  --  at this point  --  dive forty feet down the rock wall into the corner where the boulders were scattered . ( " Boy , I stood there a minute thinking what a loss for American letters before I jumped , " he said . " All the way down I kept telling myselfthat , after all , the Nobel Prize was just a material gaud and they 'd probably have given it to some Icelandic bard or Southern queer anyhow . " )  |p419He  landed almost on top of Claude . Claude rolled a little to one side , muttered , " Mo Kay , " and began to sink . To keep his own nerve up , Clem plied him with questions all the while he was dragging him to the side where they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a shelf of rock and boosted Claude halfwayonto a flat slope above the surface . But altogether the grips were too precarious and Claude too heavy for Clem to plant him securely . After they had rested a minute , Clem asked if Claude could n't climb a bit under his own power . Again Claude insisted that he was O.K.  --  and promptly slithered out of Clem 's grip . Feet first he sank straight down , like a magician 's silk whipped through a ring . Clem went down among the rocks and pulled him out again . By this time the girls had picked their way down to a ledge from which they could reach Claude 's hand , and , in a scene composedlike the deposition from the Cross , the three of them hoisted his sagging body up and dragged him into the shade . For a long time Clem lay alone on his back , feeling his pulse ( a hundred and twenty ) and getting a more familiar perspective on the omnipresent vultures circling above the peak of rock . He stared at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it out . Later , when they had all come safely back to our house and were telling Janet and me about it while we sat in candlelight on the patio , I happened to use the term " episode " in referring to what had happened . Quickly Clem caught me up and said it was n't an episode . It was a total , he insisted , without antecedents , without sequel . It was complete in itself and therefore without any relation to time . It was not one in a series of events . " If you saw it that way , " I said agreeably . " All right . Dramatically complete . But not tragic , thank God . Thank God no one was killed . " Clem replied with arguments to this attempt of mine to soothe everyone with a platitude . " If you count us , we 're all here , " he said . His voice had a peculiarbrazen note that I would have thought hysterical if I were not inclined to believe that it was , in sober truth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  realistic , " he said furiously . " But how do you know your count was right before it happened ? There was someone else with us who did n't come out of the water . " Sheila was watching him with anxious astonishment . " Do n't fightp420with us now , " she said . " It 's all over . Let 's have a thanksgiving nightcapand a bite . " " I know , " he said . With no tolerance for the lingering mood of fright the others meant to tame and dispel , he began to insist that in spite of appearances there had been " a death and a birth " equally terrible and fraught with consequences while he had been under water looking for Claude . " How do you know ? " Sheila demanded . She was losing patience with him . His lids lowered with an expression strangely compounded of suffering and cunning . I thought I had never seen him treat her with such calm and cruel contempt . " It does n't matter how I know things , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What I saw fits with everything else . You 'll see . " Did we ever see the birth and death that fit  --  symbolically at least  --  with all that preceded and all that followed that plunge of his ? Yes , I think we saw a hero reborn in archetypical circumstances . We were soon to have , in weird and comic parody , a disciple 's testimony of the rebirth . Reborn from the water , returned from his night journey through the war to a place in the desert heaven of our new age , henceforward Clem would shade us like a colossus . There is no doubt about the identity of the hero reborn to us . But the death he saw down there in the pellucid green and mineral-taintedwater  --  whose ? I can believe that in the moment of crisis he may have had a perception exempt from time , a truly propheticknowledge . But was it an individual death or that communal shade which inhabits all of us impersonally ? Was it Susan 's death he foresaw , so that someday he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Was it his own ? Bentley 's ? What of the Strongest Boy in Boda ? " There was another who did n't come up , " Clem said , glowering at Claude , who nodded in shame , as if he understood exactly what Clem meant.  |p421ALL  SUMMER we had been anticipating advance copies of Clem 's book of poetry  --  each of us in his own way sensing the need to take the physical thing in our hand , as if it would be the charter that justified our being where we had been , working as we were . Half a dozen times letters from Clem 's publisher had come to tantalize us with promises that our wait was nearly over . Now , a week and a half before we were to head back toward the border , the representative of the local post office bicycled into our yard with a special-delivery parcel that had to be put into the very hands of Senor Aaron Clement Anderson . Senor Anderson , surrounded by well-wishers , opened the parcel as if it might be a time bomb sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sugar Oboe , " he read , from the carmine letters on the dust jacket . Plainly he did not understand what these obscure words meant . He flipped the book open and felt the paper for quality . Good quality , it seemed . He thrust a copy at Sheila and said , " Here . " She began to cry , turned to the dedication , read it and cried louder . " Stop that , " Clem ordered her . He jerked the book out of her hands and turned it over suspiciously to read the testimonials on the back . " It says , Anderson reports a war that newspaper readers may not have heard of . ' I wonder what war they 're talking about , hmmm ? Look , Mommy , what old Bentley says . Stop this caterwauling ! It 's only a book . He says I 'm a winged two-headed horse . Mommy , be quiet . " " I ca n't help it , " Sheila said . " It 's such a little book and there 's so much in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if she was right about that . There were all the titles at least , transformed into bold black type . In the front the poems he had written in England , France , and Germany : " The Great War on the Piano Tops , " " Firefight at Verdun , " " How We Brought the Good News to Ghent , " " Country Matters , " " A Bomberp422Named Vondalee " and the rest . In a separate section at the back were the poems he had published before the war . " It 's not so little as all that , " he said . " You want it carved , for God 's sake ? " We had the feeling that if he could have he would have put a rubberband and a propeller on the little book and flown it , put a stick of mast on it and sailed it , or equipped it with a string to make a yoyoof it . He so visibly wanted it to do something now that it was here in physical reality . But what can a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it by heart , presently slipped down to his barn to read it all through again by himself . He read the thirty-nine poems in something under twenty minutes and returned to us with a look not so much disappointedas just plain lost . We knew that down there where the dead lizards lived this book had died for him . All these years of work , with so much of his salvation hopefully staked on the outcome  --  and the little machine of a book turned into paper , ink and glue almost as soon as he got it in his hands . For a similar investment a scientist would have been able at least to blow up a city . Obstinate against his disappointment , Janet and Sheila and I determined to make a festivity of this day . We started planning where we would have dinner that evening and how smashing a party we could afford . We knew , at least casually , eight or ten Americans who were in Acapulco that week who would have been fit celebrants for the birth of a book , besides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driving around through the day , announcements and offering of invitations , it was only the Pogorskis and two other couples ( one couple homosexual ) that sat down with us for dinner in that restaurant on the north side of the z6calo . Some others had promised to catch up with us later . Claude , with his cactus-thorn hair slicked down for once , meek in a lavender bow tie and a white shirt , was clearly trying to be on good behavior for that night . Or , since he customarily phrased his internal fury and despair gently , it might be more exact to say that he had made an enormous effort to analyze what about him was offensive to Clem and was overconscientious at first in his efforts to suppress it . The waiters who brought our drinks and dinner did not remind him of the oppressed masses  --  at least he did n't say so  --  and the head of a fighting bull , hung in the gloomy dining room where we ate , did not remind him of the evil aggressiveness in man commemorated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who " broke the web of life . " He merely beamed and fawned and nodded and bit his tongue to keep from uttering his obsessions . And got enormously drunk while the rest of us were still in the lofty first stages of alcoholic euphoria . The first we knew of his condition was when he rapped on the table with his knife handle . Shakily he got to his feet . There was a droopingleer on his mouth while he bobbed his head and nerved himself to speak . Bob and Merton , the two homosexuals , nervously moved their chairs closer together , and I had the impression that under the table they were holding hands for comfort , sensing the strain . The other couple , George and Helen Gantner , beamed encouragement and anticipation . They were very well adjusted . Venetia smiled . I wonder if she knew what Claude had to say . " Not forget the occasion for which we are here , " he said , blisteringus all with an accusing gaze , as if we had forgotten indeed . " To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wine . Some are the same and some are different . Shit . I myself am a little man , given mysterious talents of air I can not cope . " Here he made a scribbling gesture , as if he were painting , and then shook his head in self-deprecationso fierce as to suggest that painting , for him , was pure mortificationof vanity . Angels snickered at every brush stroke . " Not so with Aaron Clement Anderson , gnome to his wishers true poet , Dichter . Casts no bread on waters . Shhhh ! " He was cautioning homosexual Merton , who had giggled and muttered , " It 's a love song . Of J. Alf  --  " Venetia said , " Clem does n't need flowers , darling . " " Sssssssh ! Onto the occasion have something to read for humanity . " Then he began to recite , not read , one of the poems from the new book that had been lent him in the afternoon when the invitation to dinner was given , no part of which he had ever seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line , " When I was a soldier at Boy Scout twelve . " Claude recited all twenty-four lines without a hitch or a pause , in a clear , boyish voice . There was something uncannyin the performance ; maybe we sensed that this was , or Claude thought it was , his true voice , breaking momentarily through the incoherenceand cursed impurity of his dogged attempts to persuade mankind to live at peace . At any rate , when he had finished it his tongue thickened again.
