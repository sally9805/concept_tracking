THE ENIGMA OF PRESIDENT NIXON A new President will be inaugurated this month in ceremonies that have the theme " Forward Together . " No one doubts that the " Forward " depends on whether we can achieve the " Together . " And no one knows how the " Together " is to be achieved . President Richard M. Nixon , though he returns to Washington in his fourth role there , after being congressman , senator , and Vice President , is a deepening enigma , one about %%horn we know less the more we see him . Indeed , one of his advantages . we have been told , is the freedom of movement afforded him by his lack of prior commitments . He can not break promises because he has made none . Except , of course . the one promise that may be impossible to keep  --  to bring us together . What can we expect ? If any pattern begins to emerge  --  e.g. , from his Cabinet appointments ? it is that Nixon wants to handle foreign policy himself ( and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than his own , as Secretary of State ) . and that he surrenders large areas of domestic policy to men more distant from him . There is some danger in the sense of priorities implied here . It is the obverse of that choice which led to Lyndon Johnson 's downfall . When Johnson entered office , domestic problems seemed most pressing , and were far more congenial to him , with his congressional experience and feel for sectional bargain . But Vietnam soon overshadowed the problem of the annual civil-rights bill ; and Johnson . who at the outset trusted experts bequeathed him by Kennedy , never gained a confident feel for , or control of , foreign policy . Nixon , in a parallel way , has always been more interested in foreign affairs , felt more qualified there . Yet he enters office at a time when some kind of careful pullback abroad appears inevitable , reflecting our disillusionment in Vietnam . It is also a time when , partly as a result of that Vietnam experience , a crisis of national confidence and unity seems impending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concern on the part of the President , and quick intimate communication with the country 's trouble spots . Nixon shows little sign of opening channels to these , the critical sources of challenge . One suspects they are too close . The farther of a problem is  --  the more it can be studied and treated impersonally , handled through agents  --  the better Nixon likes it . He is a man of the study , the crisis room . the hot line ( or any remote-control instrument ) not of the crowd , the ghetto , or the troubled campus . Then why , one naturally asks , did he choose an inaugural slogan that addresses itself to the problem of domestic unity ? The answer to that question can tell us a good deal about the new President 's style of operation . Even before last summer 's Miami convention , Nixon 's manager . John Mitchell , was telling newsmen that his candidate would run a nondivisive campaign . Nixon had to win the nomination in a wav that made it still possible to win the election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way that made ; t still possible to govern the country . On Friday , August 9 , after choosing Spiro Agnew as his running mate , Nixon himself told reporters , " We 've got to get the country together . " On that note the campaign was launched -- with Nixon 's champion advance man , John Nidecker ( Rally John ) , arranging a great ticker-tape parade in Chicago , the site of the Democrats ' embarrassing convention . Rally John , who is putting the finishing touches on the inaugural ceremony  --  along with such other professionals as the assistant manager of the Tournament of Roses Parade in Pasadena  --  is so thorough in his preparation that an exasperated woman in San Antonio had to tell him , " John , we will not burn down the Alamo to draw attention to Nixon 's arrival . " The advance work was professional all the way  --  girls , hats , streamers and placards . Thousands of placards . So many that an overestimate of one crowd left an unused litter of posters on the ground , like the rifles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , placards were loaded back into a station wagon and raced to the next stop before the campaign bus could make it . New faces under the same old signs all day . The advance men were careful , too , not to rely on printed signs . They preferred the kind hand-sprayed with air guns . Done by high-school girls with unsteady hands , they looked like an outpouring of the nation 's sentiment . though the girls were assembled the night before in armories and fire stations to spray the words that were dictated to them . And what words ! Given a candidate who is as straight and square as they come , the advance men disarmed expected criticism by taking the initiative , they spray-gunned such fantasies as " Nixon has Soul " and " Nixon Has That OohAah , " though the most generous estimate of Nixon 's resources could never turn up in him the slightest suspicion of " ooh " or mere trace of " aah . " Yet those were the signs that seemed to please Nixon most ; he would tell the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chanted , " Nixon has that ooh-aah , " and the girls up front would take the cue , repeating the chant while he beamed . " with it " at last . The advance men , sure of their course now , had him sockin ' it to various " ' ems " in Dick 's name , though not his style . ( Nixon did not , at the outset , understand the phrase and would shout , " Sock it to me . " So much for his " soul . " ) The advance men even put the ban-the-bomb sign on their placards to make it look as though the Gene McCarthy types had come around to their man . They were contrivit an appearance of unity  --  a pasteboard cipher army of placards , like the propped-up dead army of Beau Geste , high-schoolers scurrying around behind the bodies to keep them upright if they slid or began to topple . And so , naturally . one of the messages they spray-gunned was " Bring Us Together Again " ? Nixon 's own slogan addressed back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use the word " again " in his August 9 press conference ) . In Deshler , Ohio , after sundown , when a laboriously assembled " Nixon Special " train shuffled its old-style cars into town . there was the normal prepared sprinkle of signs on the ground . Vicki Lynne Cole , a 13-year-old , was there in a Nixonette dress ( advance men . preparing Nixon 's high-school army , had been forced , in this small town of 2,000 , to lower the recruiting age to the eighth grade ) . Vicki was not only uniformed and rehearsed , but given a placard : it read " L.B.J. Convinced Us  --  Vote Republican . " Vicki was so excited as the train came in that she dropped her sign . But as she worked her way forward to join the protective ring of girls from which Nixon spoke at all his rallies ( a ruffle of paper dresses and energetic puberty around the microphone ) , she saw another sign on the ground . There was not even time to turn it over and read it : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till some boys teased her . told her the sign was an advertisement for a boyfriend , did she look at the front . and read : " Bring Us Together Again . " But Nixon had already seen the words and meant to use them before another crowd , as he had used the planted oohs and aahs from one stop to the next , the placards ferried from one town forward . The right time to use the Deshler placard did not come till the morning of November 6. when , after a long Election Night that saw the slow blood-drain of celebrants front the Waldorf ballroom , Nixon finally squeaked through , and came downstairs to make his victory statement . He told the story  --  how he had seen the girl , the sign , and been affected , so affected that it " will be the great objective of this Administration , at the outset , to bring the American people together " ( he still did not use the " again " of the advance man 's sign ) . But the managers could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unimproved . " The words seemed , no doubt , too negative for slogan makers . So the inaugural epigram became more upbeat  --  not . as had first been announced , " Bring Us Together , - but " Forward Together . " This one slogan is a symbol of the whole campaign  --  it was a careful process by which the Nixon promoters talked to themselves and pretended to hear America speaking . It is this omnipresent contrivance that gives Nixon his reputation . however undeserved. for deviousness . What is more important . it raises the question of how ' he w ill , as President . engage the people he means to bring together . The campaign was not a bit of hoopla arranged to meet transient needs , its methods easily discarded now . The operation reflected Nixon himself  --  just as . presumably , his Presidency will also reflect the man 's traits : the external mechanisms of control were simply extensions of the facade-construction and reality-rehearsal that goes on within him all the time . On the night in Miami when he was nominated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communing with himsell. with his yellow pad , with his TV set . When the Wisconsin delegation put him over the top , the rest of his company  --  his aides . Pat , the girls  --  celebrated with the cautious , tentative air so typical of his entourage : quietly , as if victory were itself a trap . But Nixon did not even relax that much into the wash of incoming prosperity . His head , and his pen , did not rise from the pad . One could almost hear the click of tumblers , slide of lenses , and computer-hum inside . At last the IBM card gave him the proper , tested signal : He tore the top sheet off his pad , handed it back toward empty air ( not to anyone in particular  --  all his bets are hedged ) , and said , " Does someone want this for a souvenir ? " He had been charged , after his 1962 defeat in California , with not knowing how to lose . But his reactions in Miami , so distrustful of the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not know how to win either . He must wait for the checking apparatus to give him the signal . Nixon has a whole assembly line of machinery between each stir of instinct and his final act . This interposed mechanism has been developed over the years , added to , spun out to vast Rube Goldberg dimensions . His family and early friends do not remember a time when he was effusive or outgoing . A man who went on double dates with him in college says that he covered his shyness with girls  --  bought time , put a buffer between words and the need for personal response ? by raising some subject for discussion like " What would have happened if Persia had conquered Greece ? " and molding the subsequent conversation as a debate ( move out of the format if one sees an opportunity , retreat if things are not going well ) . That device was simple : but years and rough experience have taught him a thousand ways , now , of increasing the time lag between any call for response and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nixon his odd , mixed appearance of both calculation and clumsiness  --  the churn of mind we sense behind those quick eyes , and the puppet-like late jerk of his limbs When the order has finally been passed through the long chain of checking devices . There is an evident rift in PRESIDENT NIXON M bet ween mover and moved , brain and body . master and puppet . He seems like an unrevcaled Wizard of Oz , Frank Morgan inside , working all the gimmicks that mainiain his control of I. merald City  --  placards rising and falling al the press of a button , and Oz gratel'ully receiving the homage he triggered in the first place . The question , then , is whether these staged little dramas of reunion will have any effect on reality . Marshaling the eighth grade is not a real way of bringing dissident young people back into American politics . One black face on each of the TV panels that questioned Nixon will not create black confidence in his plans for black capitalism . Confidence must be given to a man , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe non-answer to the nation 's problems may work over the short run  --  for the country is frightened , not willing to move boldly . But the problems grow around us while we sit paralyzed . Can Nixon  --  who seemed to " freeze " in the last weeks of his own campaign as ? the sense of initiative went over to Humphrey  --  can this Nixon create the air of confidence that the nation needs for action ? The hopeful answer is that the new Nixon is relaxed , poised and confident . There is obviously sonic truth to this . In fact , the secret of Nixon 's durability resides largely in his willingness to sacrifice former selves to the self of the moment . Indeed , those cartoon incarnations serve his purpose : No one could possibly live down to them . Some people meeting him for the first time are astounded that he does not gnaw the skulls of old foes throughout the interview . But as fast as he shifts homes . selves , images , friends , campaigners , the old Nixon always haunts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negations as the " not-old . " The new Nixon will be not-Tricky , not-Ruthless , the all-around reliable not-Dick . The old persists as a norm , departure from which establishes the new . Old Nixon was a failure , a loser ? ? then the new one would establish his base as a successful lawyer , partner in a Wall Street firm ; plead a case beirre the Supreme Court ; build his c impaign organization out from the pa Triers and members and offices of hit firm . It was impossible to sell the min who could not sell a used car ' ? ? then Wall Street would go to Madison Avenue , to Harry Treleaven of the J , Walter Thompson agency , who , with law partner Len Garment , took charge of consumer-packaging the candidate . Nixon was no good on TV ? ? then Madison Avenue would go directly to CBS , to Frank Shakespeare , who left a division presidency with that network to put Nixon , favorably , back on all networks . Nixon can not relax , delegate authority , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to California , to the vast personnel of J. Waiter Thompson 's western branch ( which handles such accounts. ; as Disney la nd ) . Fo er'eweut 13011 Haldeman , who scheduled the candidate to austere enforced leisure . To dark slow Ron Ziegler. busy before Ibis for Disney , who relayed things It ) I he press without a touch of personal interpretation . To bustling young advance men , who gave Nixon structured rallies the way rent-a-party firms now package celebrations for your child 's biggest birthday . Nixon is a gut-lighter who takes naturally to the low road ? ? then his campaign managers would answer the personal attacks on Nixon , and Spiro Agnew would play " old Nixon " to Nixon 's studied attempt at playing Ike . It was a magnificent operation , a vast exercise in erasure , an attempt to efface the old Nixon , a veritable war waged against him  --  Nixon winning at last , over himself . And yet it is like the old Nixon , the only , original one , to act this way . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a structure ( like the debate on Persia and Greece ) ? They are all extensions of his internal time-lag device , ways of controlling , simultaneously , the world and himself . The most important set of rods and levers in this long line of intermeshing controls was the first one he established : the law firm . There was a whole area of vulnerability which could be covered only by the armor of banker 's black convincingly worn . Elaborate analyses have been written about Nixon 's surprise comeback , " how he did it " ? the groundwork of party unity he worked on , the ties and debts he solidified in the 1966 campaigns , the collection of bright aides and writers , the early wooing of Goldwater forces , the last-minute pacification of the South , the subtle neutralization of liberal alternatives . All these contributed , of course , to the final result . But none of them would have been possible without the base . And the base was 20 Broad Street . Nixon sought out the firm , through friends ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it as a failure , in flight from his native state and lifelong career . No one at the law firm knew him personally ; some of the members were Democrats . He was in every way on trial . But there has always been one strength in Nixon  --  a capacity for work , and his confidence in that capacity . He was back al the industrious apprentice stage , and few people realized that the striver in him had not died , had never won the solid achievement or security that would let him rest . He was an apprentice still . Nixon did it from the bottom . To be admitted lo the New York bar , he had Eo write a brief essay on constitutionalism ; it was called , by the examiner , the best he had seen in 28 years . Nixon took a privacy case before the Supreme Court  --  one which may haunt him if he backs legislation on such things as wiretapping  --  and he presented his argument brilliantly . He told one newsman , " I knew they would all be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and out , and foresee all possibilities . And I did . " That is the confidence Nixon has . He is the boy who will do more homework than anyone else in i he class . He does not claim to be brilliant ( he rather despises brilliance , it does not gird itself for the long haul ) , but he makes sure that he knows more than the class genius . His law partners were impressed  --  and that respect , won fairly , gave him needed props , replacing old ones that were kicked away in 1962 . It also gave him an essential , irreplaceable commodity : money . He was in literally desperate need of money . Not to spend ? he and his wife are natural ascetics , with an indifference to what she calls , disparagingly , " creature comforts . " Not to use  --  any money he could make would be a drop in the bucket if he went for " the big one " ( and one of the ironies of the situation was that he could only run for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he began if he aimed at anything less : last fall we voted into the White House the proverbial man who could not be elected dog catcher ) . No , the money was not to spend or to use but to have . During the presidential campaign , I rode the press plane to Michigan with one of Nixon 's campaign coordinators , a lawyer from California who had worked with Nixon for years . " Without a substantial personal income , " he said , " Dick could not have made it to first base , Republicans , especially those who finance the party , respect only one thing , success , and they have only one way of measuring success , money . Dick never had any money before now . He could not talk to these people as an equal , even when he was Vice President . The thing that would have killed him with them was any suspicion that he simply needed a job . Now they know he 'll he giving up a damn good job , and good money . " All of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ address , the right clothes , the right friends and associates . He lived in New York as a recluse , but he lived there  --  on Fifth Avenue , in the very building he went to when Rockefeller made his demands on the candidate in 1960 . The law firm was in the Wall Street area ; his memberships and country clubs were proper . He was now on the board of important companies , like Mutual of New York . The man who came to Congress with wide flowery California ties , who still wore bright West Coast suits during the gray-flannel era of the ' 50 's , had " taken the habit " ? dark Wall Street suits , the earned unobtrusive uniform , impeccably tailored , with conservative striped tie . Nixon had always tt-Presented the rest of the Rcrul-lican Party , never its traditional core , the Eastern Establishment . When the Establishment chose Eisenhower in 1952 to beat back Robert Taft 's movement  --  the heartland party 's best bid for supremacy  --  Nixon was added " for balance . " Geographical balance ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anti-Communism ) . Nixon did not , in joining his firm , join the Establishment , but he put on a protective coloring that greatly reduced East Coast hostility toward him . Power is shifting westward anyway ; the Establishment is not as important as it used to be . Actually , joining it might have been a liability . Getting just chummy enough with it was the right move , and it was important to Nixon personally : another threat minimized , made impotent , subjected to his systems of control . This wa , s his base , then . The law firm was just staid enough , not too staid ; it would suffer no aesthetic qualms about calling on Madison Avenue . Just enough New York , but not too much ; Disneyland promoters would be welcome . Just enough conservative , but not too much . Just enough political , but not too much . " We do n't have any politicians around here , " claimed John Mitchell , the law partner turned campaign manager . " That 's why it seems so professional . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who spend most of their time worrying about their own position or image . We 're interested in the candidate . " " Interested in the candidate . " Loyal . And loyalty has always meant something quite different , in Nixon circles , from the normal debt to one 's leader . Nixon wants respect , and goes after it in his famous " one-on-one " sessions , performing , displaying his competence , bringing out all the fruits of his homework . Those who are treated to this experience are usually impressed , and they come away with a dilemma of personal judgment : Either Nixon is a scoundrel  --  the grimy monster who slithers out of Herblock manholes  --  or he has been terribly wronged in the past ( " shafted , " as he put it himself ) . But if one thinks him wronged. and joins his circle , one takes up on his behalf a militant protectiveness . This style is epitomized by the oldest and closest of all Nixon 's political associates , Rose Woods , his executive secretary . Others soon vibrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have a roughhouse taste for political mayhem , is now considered almost too delicate for politics . Thus the bright young men of 1967 ? Pat Buchanan , Ray Price , Martin Anderson and the rest  --  insensibly became part of the machinery through which Nixon both meshes with the outside world and holds it off . Buchanan took it upon himself to play Rose Woods in preventing journalists he considers hostile from getting to Nixon  --  e.g. , Gloria Steinem . Martin Anderson re-peated to newsman after newsman that " Nixon is just as much an intellectual as any of my professors at MIT and Columbia. - And Ray Price echoed hint : " II academicians do not like Ni " . it iS simply because they do not know him. - This corporate spirit toward " the Boss " runs  --  if in diluted measure  --  through the whole organization , down to its foot troops . The men who took away hostile signs at Nixon rallies , who helped the police screen out blacks and hippies from the crowds trying to enter the public halls , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside  --  they were technicians doing their job ; but the animating zeal hack of it all was a belief that Nixon has been picked on too long . They can not stand to see him picked on any longer . These polite young cogs in the time-lag machine all wore their candidate 's uniform , the dark blue or black suits , the dark striped ties . They would , of course , have worn Mickey Mouse Club ears if that were their duty to " the account. - But the dark ' 60 's equivalent of the ' 50 's gray-flannel suit is the garb they lied most congenial . They are young men who still believe in success . The whole point of politics in 1968 was that the norms of success are now called into question . Not , however , for the Nixon types gliding from bus to bus of the campaign , cooing continually into walkie-talkies cradled by their right shoulders ; success is not a tarnished thing for the Disneyland Mafia . All our politics needs , it thinks , is a little tinkering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them that attacks on the system do n't pay ; give them " a piece of the action . " It is good action . It is important to remember that such men exist , that a bright young writer in his middle 20 's can seek out Richard Nixon  --  Pat Buchanan did it in 1965 ? as the spiritual leader he would most like to follow . At a time when young people were following McCarthy , Kennedy , McGovern  --  even Rockefeller ; even , at the end , Humphrey  --  as a way of attacking the political process , Nixon 's young men trusted the Establishment . Nixon likes to boast of his team 's youth ; but in a very real political sense , young people like his have nowhere else to go . Nixon , though the challenger , argued more for things as ( ley were than did Humphrey . the incumbent 's representative . The young men 's opposition to " radicals " goes far beyond indifference . It is contemptuous . One of Nixon 's speech writers , flying on the Tricia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Who cares about ' the kids ' as you call them ? They do n't vote . And it is not true , as some people say , that they are the best of our youth . The best people are going into the laboratories and foundations , " He is undoubtedly right , by one test of " the best " ? best grades , best prospects , best pay . And what else is there ? It isinteresting. however , that Nixon 's own inner core of young men did not come front laboratories and rounda WEIS , hut , predominantly . Irons ruilkm and the ad agencies . I brought up the fact that N ixon is notoriously distrusted by the academy . " The acadetr , is obsolete , " he answered . " The best people are in the foundations now . " The old-style teacher , like the old-style huinanities student , is not " where the action is " ? and the money . Technology , research , and traditionalism  --  that is the path toward success , Nor did racial disturbances bother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Negro has found out it will not gain him anything . " Riots , it appears , were simply ploys in the game of success . If promotion does not follow , try something else . Another Nixon man , a strategist who worked under John Mitchell at 445 Park Avenue throughout the campaign , thinks there may still be a little trouble : " We may have to choose a key city and just cream ' ern . That will put an end to it- He is not worried about the political consequences of such action : " The Negro is what  --  eleven percent of the population ? Twelve ? Of those , many are not of voting age . Many who are do n't register . And many who register do n't vote . So what are we dealing with ? ? seven percent of the electorate ? Five ? You lose far more than that by trying to appeal to the Negro voter . " It is the cost-accounting approach to politics . These are young men who scrawl the hopeful Frodo-graffito up and down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only passion in this cadre is for efficiency , and for its spiritual aura , decorum . I was caught between the effect of these two passions on the day of Nixon 's campaign motorcade through Pennsylvania . Part of the efficiency of the operation was a baggage pickup one hour or more before breakfast , which meant that the clothes one would wear must be set aside , and the bag pushed into the hotel corridor for one to get an extra half hour of sleep . That morning I found , 15 minutes before the buses left the hotel door . that I had not set out a tie . The bag was gone . So all day I went tieless as we drove in and out of little towns . When , that night , I asked one of the press aides for something , he said he would take care of it he was efficient ( they arc all efficient ) and polite , and he had called me by name for days . But now he said , pointedly , " Who are you ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long pedagogic pause ?

Pat Buchanan came out into the pink late afternoon of that never-never land , and said , " Where did you gel the green suit , Garry ? From the natives ? " Nixon himself is often as uncomfortable-looking out of tie and suit as if he were naked . In a bright colored campaign picture , he was shown walking with his family on the while sand at Key Biscayne . Tricia and Julie are barefoot , in little-girl sunsuits . David Eisenhower , also barefoot , has on a bathing suit and pull-over shirt . Even Pat has her shoes off . But Nixon wears socks , shoes , sharply pressed slacks and a sport shirt of the hang-out coat sort , all four buttons fastened . The ensemble is not true banker 's black . But they are all  --  slacks , shirt , socks , shoes  --  of a muted blue . Everyone is acutely aware , around Nixon , of the image he means to convey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Solidity , competence , calm knowleigeability . No flamboyance : one two pooh-pooh " charisma " and dash , call it " show biz . " Visits to ghettos are " empty gestures " and " mere symbols " in the Nixon camp . where " substantive " business programs are the only " realistic " answer to unrest . " Glamour boys " is a term one sneers , as the Boss does . Nixon comes offering a new era of normalcy , a return to Eisenhower somnolence . He does not promise adventure , but peace  --  telling people , after the tumult and suspicion of recent years , that they have " nothing to fear but fear itself . " It is a theme his campaign sounded with dull insistence . He ended his standard speech on the hustings this way ; " America is a great country . Do n't believe anybody who tells you it is not . There is nothing wrong with this country that a good election will not cure . " Agnew , with his great unerring ear for the wrong term , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the Establishment " for cure  --  unaware that the arrogance of " the Establishment " was precisely what galled them . In speech after speech delivered in the last week of the campaign through Texas , David Eisenhower would get up and say , " All the young people here prove the rioters in Chicago were wrong Students love America . " The System lives . There is one comforting thing about all this dreary cheerfulness : Nixon does not believe a word of it . lie Lutist 's that the one thing to fear out on ; 1 minefield is the lack of fear ; mid he has spent his life walking minefields. 1 here is always another crisis : one staggers from one to the next . Whatever the worst is , he expects it . That is his major qualification for leadership in our times . He really does know the size of the threat . His excuse for choosing Agnew he had an excuse , though no more than that -- was his knowledge of the true threat Wallace posed . Not simply the possibility of throwing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Wallace would institutionalize the bitterness of the times , create a semipermanent camp and rallying place for discontent . Better to call the Wallaceites back into a balanced national party , better even to bargain with them , than let them drift away  --  a dangerous detached mass on which the System could someday founder . The excuse does not go far enough , does not cope with the danger posed by the thought of AgneW 'S succeeding to office , But I believe the choice was dictated in some measure by Nixon 's Isar of impending crackup . He lives with that fear always . Indeed , his fatalism was a latent part of Nixon 's appeal to the electorate . Beneath all the talk of " this great country " and its preeminence throughout " the last third of the century , " people knew they were electing no cheerful warrior . Nixon is a worrier . Matched against euphoric Hubert and his flat fizz-gone " politics of joy , " Nixon conveyed a sense of how bad things are . He is a frowner . Even his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows the darkness and moves in it as a native . We are in for some repression , Walter Lippmann argued ; why not elect someone to whom the task comes naturally ? More people than the Wallaceites were suspecting , last year , that the future President would have to show a hard streak , perhaps even some meanness . This was a year when the People did not vote for the hero but the heavy ; and Humphrey , for all his rotundity ( an the heavy . itlay itandr orotundity ) , could n Why , then , did Nixon try to exude cheer , suggesting complacency about " this great nation " ? It was partly , no doubt , ritual  --  the stylistic confidence expected of a candidate . At a deeper level , his approach was therapeutic , a doctor 's soothings of his fevered patient . But it was also done because the inhabitants of Emerald City  --  and above all , the court guards  --  must believe in Oz the Great and Terrible .

It helped , when David Eisenhower talked of " all the young MTh : here , " for him to believe that high-school girls , dressed up and brought to the party by advance men , are symbols of political concern . It helps the defenders of stability to believe that " the riot cycle " is over . that calculating self-interest will make people " come around " to the System as black capitalists or as young foundation types .

" But will this influx of youth resemble the squealing of high-school girls at his rallies . pre-bloom " flower children " with plastic petals ? There is reason to fear it . His Disneyland Mafia will seek out its own kind , inculcate its satisfied philosophy of corporate success and climbing , screen out all " shagginess . " Nixon claims that his will be an Administration that listens . In fact , his " listening posts " - 700 of them  --  were set up across the land last summer . I first encountered this device at an Agnew rally in Queens . A teen-age couple , resolutely bland , understudies for David and Julie , came up to me , clumsily working a microphone and tape recorder : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " About what ? " " Anything that concerns you . " Get it off your chest . Millions did . The tapes were sent to Washington , where computers typed " personalized " answers  --  one paragraph per concern . dialed out of a bank of 70 stock answers to the most common questions . That dialing process was a perfect extension of the man we watched on television . Bud Wilkinson would ask the same questions , or a panel would , over and over . There would be a pause ( the internal dialing ) , a signaled mechanical frown of concern and " personalized " typing ( print-out on the face  --  still fuzzy , that machine has never been perfected ) . and Nixon would finally deliver , in his tight resonant voice  --  like Disney 's Audio-Animatronic figure of Lincoln , improvising Gettysburg Addresses to a ballet of programmed gestures  --  one of the 70 paragraphs stored in this walking memory bank . Nor is this kind of operation restricted to voter consumption . Nixon specializes in remote-control concern . Form letters , sent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommendations on the subject of the Vice President lit is hood to imagine the majority picking Spiro Agnew ) . Nixon put John flirlichmon in charge ola talent hunt for 2,000 bright young government appointees : names were to be collected from party and academic and social sources , and fed into a computer . This " Oz " has a special taste for robots . Charles Rhyne . Nixon 's friend stores the world 's legal systems in an electronic memory hank and publishes the periodical Lan ' and Cennputer Technology . One of Nixon 's " progressive " proposals is the Martin Anderson plan for it corn coniputeriied job hank to solve unemployment by showing where jobs arc . Nixon relies on such modern paraphernalia , presided over by his young technicians , to make his Administration look " oben " and contemporary . But much of the gadgetry is Mickey Mouse stuff . The " job hank , " for instance . does not get to the real problems of unemployment  --  e.g. , the chronically unemployed , who can find johs but do not have work disciplines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : One can often make the quickest use of such tools in black-and-white tasks , and those who use them best and oftenest may he men who have a simplistic view of jobs to he done . Computers are , in that sense . reactionary . Disneyland blends space gimmickry and nostalgia , the next century 's tools and the last century 's attitudes , electronic innards and the face of Lincoln ( " takes make-up wonderfully " ) . Goldwater is a jet pilot , and his Ilag reacts to light-sensitized triggers , rising and falling automatically . All the new tools " process " realitycope with it by fending it olf. -I his es pla ins Nixon 's consonance with them . Ile does not need anything so crude as the Cireece-Persia debate any more . Ile has whole herds of offnputer , , and semi-robots out before him . scouting threats , distancing the questioner , baffling confrontation . The extension of that gap between himself and any external challenge is made much easier by technology . He can " communicate " by computer-typed letters , by robot-managed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TV films . His people , professional arrangers , can structure things better for him than he ever did by himself ( the failure of his own effort is what necessitates the structuring in the first place ) ; but it is the same task , the same machinery extended and developed , sent out through layer after layer of personnel and apparatus . " Old Nixon " and " New Nixon " are one , and are Oz . There is a real man somewhere back there ; but he is getting increasingly difficult to reach or imagine . Any hope of the machine 's breakdown  --  that is. a breakout from the rigid cage he carries around him for self-defense. restricting his movements  --  gets slimmer . Self-control extends its outworks into widespread environment-control ; one must toil through a land of robots to reach him . And the very perfection of this mechanical labyrinth could he self-defeating . The Wizard is far more likable when Toto knocks aside the screen than when he resonated behind his mechanical Head : with a hotel head and er wrinkled lace who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Tin Woodman. raising his as , rushed toward the Bale noun and cri. ' d ma , - Who are you ' ? " I am 0.7. slat Great aml Terrihle , " said the lath-man , in a trembling voice . " But do n't strike me  --  pl. rose do n't  --  and I 'll do anything you Ivan ! me to . " The odd thing is that Nixon does ? want to do what the nation , speaking its needs , tells him to . He does have a sense of historical peril corresponding to reality  --  though this is hard to discern behind the official funerary cheer of his young executives . He does have a concern for those who suffer  --  his genuine compassion startled reporters during his visit last fall to a home for deaf children . He has an excellent record on civil rights . But how is this sense of urgency to be projected through the screens and mechanical checks ? And how are the poor to approach him . through the intermediary emerald gates ? Nixon 's guards would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tie . All the dark suits form a black cocoon around him . Nixon can . and does , t pity ' those he does not fear . But defensiveness  --  i.e .. a fear  --  inhibits all his motions . The danger of a vast machinery for manipulating reality by remote control is that it can proliferate until the cogs are dealing with nothing but new cogs . Reality-control becomes one 's only reality . There is always a new process to add to the lengthening system , new check or self-corrector , or improvement of the old ; and each new thing must have its monitor , and that in turn must he monitored  --  and so on ad infinitum . A creeping solipsism overcomes the whole enterprise  --  as it did with Disney 's ventures : each product became an advertisement for another product , and the two were always fertile with a third thing . The process feeds on itself and yet , paradoxically , swallows everything around it . Disney was himself the sorcerer 's apprentice . unable to reverse the spell . No wonder he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming hack everywhere he moved through his hall of mirrors . Nixon , too . has mirrors around him , the robots in dark suits . the machinery he uses to protect himself . Disney 's Lincoln controls his own environment . keeps the temperature right for his plastic skin ; extends his machinery Out through the floor below ; has automatic doors to close and protect him from fire and damage . The question is : Do we want an Audio-Animatronic President " capable of forty-eight separate body actions as well as seventeen head motions and facial expressions " ? To hold reality at a distance is one thing when one is controlling it . But Nixon must make sure reality has some way , eventually , of reaching him . And he must reach it ; reach us . For now that he is President . his self-defense has a new meaning : He defends himself , after all , from us.
