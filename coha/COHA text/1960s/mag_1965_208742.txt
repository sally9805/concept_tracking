Anybody who has tried to start an automobile on a cold winter morning knows how unpredictably exciting the internal combustion engine can be . After last week 's British Grand Prix at Silverstone , Jim Clark ( TIME , cover , July 9 ) has had just about all the excitement he can stand . There he was in his little green Lotus , leading Graham Hill by a comfortable 35 sec. , with the race four-fifths over . Coming out of a bend , Clark stepped on the accelerator . Gasp . Cough . <P> Apparently his spark plugs were fouled . Hill 's B.R.M. pit crew heard the rough engine too . Graham caught their frantic signals , grimly poured it on . Drifting through the corners as tightly as possible , slipstreaming other cars to gain momentum before he passed , Hill began to eat into Clark 's lead at the rate of 3 sec. or more a lap . Clark knew Hill was coming ; he kept glancing over his shoulder , ducking back to fiddle with his controls , trying to coax some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Clark 's car conked out completely-only to start again . With one lap to go , the crowd was on its feet as the public address announcer ticked off Clark 's dwindling lead . Seven seconds , six , five , four , three-and at that instant , right thumb raised high in the classic gesture of victory , Jimmy Clark swept under the checkered flag . By the barest of margins , a scant 100 yds. , he had won his fourth straight Grand Prix race of the season .
