On a narrow ledge of the high Andes , 75 miles northwest of the ancient Inca capital of Cuzco , a handful of Peruvians and Americans met last week to dedicate a bronze plaque to U.S. Archaeologist Hiram Bingham and the mysterious lost city he discovered 50 years ago . Some experts believe that parts of the city , which Bingham named Machu Picchu ( Old Peak ) , are 60 centuries old , which would make it 1,000 years older than ancient Babylon . More recently , if its ruins are interpreted correctly , it was at once an impregnable fortress and a majestic royal capital of an exiled civilization . <P> <P> Built on a saddle between two peaks , Machu Picchu is surrounded by a granite wall , can be entered only by one main gate . Inside is a maze of a thousand ruined houses , temples , palaces , and staircases , all hewn from white granite and dominated by a great granite sundial . In Quechua , language of the sun-worshipping Incas and their present-day descendants , the dial was known as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hiram Bingham , Yale scholar and later U.S. Senator from Connecticut , set out on muleback in 1911 in search of the lost Indian city , which he was convinced was more than legend . For years there was talk of ruins located far above the Urubamba Canyon near Cuzco , but they were known only to a few local Indians until Bingham came upon " a great flight of beautifully constructed stone-faced terraces , perhaps a hundred of them , each hundreds of feet long and ten feet high . " Bingham died five years ago , after spending much of his free time exploring and writing about Machu Picchu. and watching it become a growing tourist attraction . Hundreds of others have studied , scraped and photographed the lost city . There are still great gaps in their knowledge , and little agreement on the significance of what they know . Fittingly enough , the best known-and most romantic-history of Machu Picchu was compiled by Discoverer Bingham himself . <P> According to Bingham , Machu Picchu was in reality the Tampu-Tocco ( " Window Tavern " ) of pre-Inca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Amautas , who ruled the highlands of the Andes for 62 generations . The last king , Pachacuti VI , was mortally wounded in a battle with barbarian tribes of the Amazon jungles , probably in the 8th century A.D. , and his body was carried by his loyal warriors to Tampu-Tocco . With the death of Pachacuti , the widespread kingdom of the Amautas broke into pieces . <P> First Inca . For four centuries , they grew farther and farther apart , and finally lost contact with each other . Then , from Tampu-Tocco , which had flourished as the capital of the Quechua tribe , came a new King named Manco Capac . Around A.D. 1200 , according to Quechua legend , he and his many brothers " set out toward the hill over which the sun rose " reached the ancient Amauta capital of Cuzco , settled there and began to rebuild the empire of his ancestors . <P> Manco Capac called himself Inca ( King ) and was the first ruler of the greatest nation the continent had ever known . According to the 17th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Capac had consolidated his power , " he ordered works to be executed at the place of his birth , consisting of a masonry wall with three windows . " The only such wall yet found is in Machu Picchu . <P>
