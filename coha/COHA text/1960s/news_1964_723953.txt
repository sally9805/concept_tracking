May 9 - Reliable sources said today that Frank Gonzalez , 27 , yachtsman for the Philippine Islands in the 1900 Olympic games . owned the gun which may have triggered the Pacific Air Lines crash Thursday . He was anon ! the 44 persons killed . The civil aeronautics board made public today the tape recording of the last message radioed from the plane in which a voice , presumably the pilot 's , said : -I 've been shot . I 've been shot . 0 my God , help . " The pilot was Ernest A. Clark . 5:1 , of San Carlos , Cal . A reliable source told the Associated Press Li San Francisco that Gonzalez gambled and lost at Reno . Nev. and carried about $100,000 air trip life insurance made out to his wife of two years . A brother , James , said Frank Gonzalez had become estranged . from his wife two months ago , and that Frank was the father of a small son . Says Gonzalez Owned Pistol The New York Herald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been identified as the owner of the .357 Smith and Wesson magnum pistol found in the wreckage of the turboprop F-27 Fairchild . All six cartridges were spent . with indications they had been fired recently . The Federal Bureau of Investigation in Washington would neither confirm nor deny the report that Gonzalez had been established as owner of , the weapon . The FBI . pushing Its search for dews , extended its operative secrecy to others who might be able to say what happened on the ill-fated flight . Gonzalez ' brother said Frank had a penchant for gambling and had gone to Reno several times , always without any word of it to his family , but his pre-1 vious trips were by car . Kept to Himself " I never knew what he was doing , " James Gonzalez said , adding that Frank kept to himself . Gonzalez worked in San Francisco as a warehouseman for a department store . His estranged wife , Patricia , described him as a man with " funny habits ... but nothing really strange . " " He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said , " but he did n't have any close friends . . . . Involvement " Preposterous " " I never saw him with a gun of any kind . It 's just to preposterous that he could be involved , in killing anyone . " The San Francisco Examiner said a check of serial numbers led investigators to a Riverside , Calif. , man who bought the gun ! there , then sold it to Gonzalez the morning before he took the plane to Reno . Many of the informants in position to shed further light on , the tragedy were disinclined to talk . FBI agents were reported tol : be interrogating Gonzales ' relatives , including his brother , mother , and father . But district ' headquarters in San Francisco kept its around-the-clock operations a secret . A spokesman said there would be no talking while the solution was being sought . Today 's playback of the taperecorded last message from the Reno-to-San Francisco plane did not pin down whose voice cried out " I 've been shot . " Tower Advised Pilot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tower advised the incoming plane that the reception was garbled . " Roger , how do you read me now ? " the plane pilot replied after apparently making adjustments . The tower said there was little improvement . Then at 6:48 a. m. there sounded an anguished cry . Then the plane vanished off radar scanning screens . Today newsmen listened to five playbacks of the recording at that point . All agreed a voice was heard saying : " I 've been shot . I 've been shot . 0 my God , help . " Appeal to United Pilot Unable to raise the plane , the Oakland tower appealed to a nearby United Air Lines plane piloted by Capt . Henry L. Bingham . Bingham could n't spot the Fairchild . " I believe there is something wrong , " radioed the tower . Back came the grim report from Bingham : " There 's a black cloud of smoke coming up thru the undercast at 9 o'clock position . Right now it looks like an oil or gasoline fire . " Ray Prock of Tracy , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flight , but who got off at Stockton , ! Cal. , declined to answer questions at his home on whether he saw any passenger acting strangely . Prock said he had been contacted by the FBI . Only a few minutes after Prock and his wife left the plane , the Fairchild dived into a low hill near Concord-40 Miles east across the bay from San Francisco  --  with such thattering force that bodies were shredded .
