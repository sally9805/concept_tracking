There are various ways to approach the coaching of an expansion team . You can coddle the players , or con them , or you can work them to the point of mutiny and pick out the loyalists . The last was the method of Norb Hecker , recently of Green Bay , who took the new Atlanta Falcons up into the Black Mountains of North Carolina and frazzled their hides . " It was hell , " said one survivor with simple accuracy . " Football , " said Hecker , " requires perfection . We wo n't have that , but we will be the best-conditioned squad in the NFL , and this is going to win us a few ball games . " // Inasmuch as Hecker , with a swing team , must play every club in the league , it is difficult to point to the opponents he will beat . The only certainty about the Falcons is that they will be last . " We 've got a lot of kids with something to prove , " says Hecker . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they were put on the expansion list . " That is the positive way of looking at it . The other way , the realistic one , is that the other clubs knew what they were doing and sent Atlanta their worst . // As a new team , Atlanta has been given first refusal of players put on waivers by all other teams . This made it possible for the Falcons to hire the ex- San Francisco defensive end , Dan LaRose , for example . Logically enough , Hecker has been working a very inclusive reject-sieve ( as has Otto Graham in talent-thin Washington ) . // Hecker has no stars of any kind but he at least has a little something in the way of defense . Left Corner Back Ron Smith , for example , is not going to be run out of the league . The right corner back , Lee Calland , and Safeties Carl Silvestri and Bob Riggle , are sharp , eager tacklers , if a little new to their assignments . There is some cheer in the area of linebacking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all time , is in the middle , while Marion Rushing , from St. Louis , and Bill Jobko , from Minnesota , play the outside positions . // The rush line is big enough , but slow  --  which means that Hecker will have it stunting to compensate . " I 'm for pouring a guy in there when we can , " he says . " You 're going to get burned , but you have to do it . " The old Detroit Lion , Sam Williams , may have a good enough year left in him at end to take some of the sting out of the burns . // Hecker would like to play a Packer-style offense  --  running straight at the defenses and controlling the ball . He will need lots of luck , for he has neither the strong , well-coordinated offensive line that the Green Bay game requires nor the well-seasoned quarterback . Dennis Claridge , the former Nebraska All-America and Orange Bowl hero , has spent the last two seasons playing behind Bart Starr and Zeke Bratkowski at Green Bay . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , but he is not yet a consistent passer . Claridge 's biggest problem is an inability to hit deep receivers . This failing is critical , since the defenses stack against the running game and the short-range passes . The not-too-fast running backs already have enough trouble picking their way through the meager holes opened by Atlanta 's not-too-effective line . Hecker may well decide not to wait for Claridge but to gamble with rookie Randy Johnson , the tall , rangy passing wizard from Texas A&amp;I who was considered the best pro quarterback prospect in college last year . He came to the Falcons ' camp with a scrapbook filled with superlatives and a collection of most-valuable-player plaques  --  from the East-West game , the Senior Bowl and the Coaches All-Star Game in Atlanta . Although he is brand new to the pro game he appears to be accurate at short and long range , and he releases the ball quickly . With Johnson operating from the pocket Atlanta scored a remarkable preseason victory over the 49ers . Claridge 's Green Bay experience and Johnson 's good early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Falcon quarterback , nothing but a place on the bench . In the line Dan Grimm , a 245-pound guard , is another Green Bay graduate and the best of a so-so unit . The Atlanta receivers are not distinguished . Angelo Coia , a former Chicago and Washington performer , is fast enough at split end , but he is injury-prone . The flanker is Alex Hawkins , a refugee from the Colt specialty teams . Emerging from the shadow of Chicago 's Mike Ditka is Tight End Billy Martin . He did not threaten Mike at Chicago , but he weighs 240 pounds , has some experience and is a reasonably capable short receiver . // At the running positions Atlanta will not be embarrassed by Ernie Wheelwright , late of New York , or Charley Scales , an understudy of Jim Brown 's at Cleveland , nor will the town be thrilled by them . The Atlanta place kicking is entrusted to Tight End Bob Jencks , whose foot , unfortunately , has never been very trustworthy . // Nevertheless Atlanta will not be humiliated this first season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Falcons will be an entertaining team , even in last place .
