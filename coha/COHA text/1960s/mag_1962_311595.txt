Tuberculosis patients danced in the corridors of New York City 's Sea View Hospital ten years ago to celebrate their speeding recovery on new drugs , mainly isoniazid , or INH ( for isonicotinic acid hydrazide ) . Last week in Manhattan , the National Tuberculosis Association summed up the good that isoniazid has done in a decade-and surveyed what still must be done to keep TB on the run and eventually make it as rare as smallpox or typhoid . <P> The greatest single killer in the U.S. in 1900 ( 39,000 deaths in a population of 76 million ) , TB dropped by 1950 to seventh rank ( 34,000 deaths in a population of 151 million ) . Doctors still do not know all the reasons for this happy decline , but they do know what happened next . Isoniazid , first synthesized in Prague in 1912 and then forgotten , was rediscovered simultaneously by three groups of chemists ( two in the U.S. ) . By 1960 , despite the population boom , TB deaths dropped to 10,500 . New TB cases reported fell from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not as sharp as the drop in the death rate partly because of better public-health detective work in finding cases ) . Sea View , which housed 1,500 tuberculous patients in 1951 , now has only 21 , is being turned mainly into a hospital and home for the aged . Famed Trudeau Sanatorium in New York 's Adirondack Mountains , which treated 12,500 victims , has shut its doors to them and turned to research and other chest diseases . So have scores of other sanatoriums , and most of the " preventoriums " where TB-infected children were exposed to sun , air and snow . <P> Stunned Bacilli . Isoniazid does not kill the tubercle bacilli or work a swift cure . What it does , explained Cornell University 's Dr. Walsh McDermott , one of the first to test it , " is to incapacitate the bacilli so that they either die naturally or can be swept away by the body 's natural defenses . A few may remain dormant , so we can not say the patient is cured-only that his disease is arrested . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start . " Others can be treated briefly , in a general hospital , and then go home . Bold surgery to remove parts of lungs was at its peak ten years ago and now is rarely necessary . " <P> Patients must take the little white isoniazid pill three times a day with meals , for at least a year after their disease is arrested . Members of a TB victim 's immediate family should also take isoniazid , especially youngsters with a positive tuberculin test reaction . The cost , never great , is now down to $1.50 per 100 pills for private patients ; and health agencies , which distribute most of the pills free , can get them for as little as $2 per 1,000 . <P> Resistant Strains . One early fear about isoniazid has been justified : from 3% to 6% of new TB cases are caused by isoniazid-resistant bacilli . But the multiplication of these resistant strains can usually be checked by giving isoniazid with a second drug ( streptomycin , para-aminosalicylic acid or cycloserine ) , and occasionally switching the combination .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
