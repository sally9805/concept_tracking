txt WASHINGTON , Feb. 6 ? The President has been employing every possible occasion to demonstrate a determination , which has finally impressed even the speculators in gold , to protect the dollar from further debasement . For example , he told his second news conference that " With every new spending program we send * * * we will suggest a source of revenue for it . " And this policy is generally accepted as one of the strongest safeguards against all forms of inflation . The President and most of his influential ? economic advisers seem to place reliance on a source of this revenue that is theoretical as contrasted with such solid sources as those additional taxes the ? traffic will bear . This theory is that certain kinds of extra spending will stimulate the economy  --  among other stimulations , reducing unemployment  --  thus producing new revenue for the treasury . Such spending , known as pump-priming , failed to attain these objectives during the New Deal , despite the billions it consumed . So until it is clear how much President Kennedy will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there can be no measure of the ability of this method to contribute to the revenue required to effect the President 's policy of balancing Federal outgo with Federal income . There is , however , a demonstrable check against waste and inflationary spending that the President has not mentioned in his messages and statements thus far . It has been sought by and for Presidents ever since 1876 , and as steadily denied by Congress , although most of the states have granted it to their Governors . This is the so-called " item veto " power whereby the President can refuse to approve certain appropriations in a Federal supply bill without disapproving the entire measure . President Eisenhower requested this power from Congress more often than any of his predecessors , but with no more success . Even though Congress has given this authority to Governors of our territories and insular possessions , and in extending it by statute to Presidents would retain the same power to override an item veto that it has to repass an entire measure , dissenters to the request have easily prevailed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expand the President 's power . For the same political reasons he could use it to strike out state and local appropriations to punish members of Congress and communities , and retain others with less justification . The " pork " in appropriation bills ? the financing of pet , extravagant and other wholly unnecessary projects  --  would not be removed ; it would simply be weighed and allocated at the White House instead of at the Capitol . As a constitutional amendment , the plan would be out of harmony with the Constitution , which restricts to Congress the power of the purse . As a statute RI would be unconstitutional . The Stone Wall in Congress In a study made for Speaker Bankhead in 1937 , Representative Hatton Sumners , a most respected ( legislator , concluded that these objections would be met if the Presidential item veto were restricted in advance by Congress to certain specified items in specified bills . But Congress was as hostile to this proposal , by which all its power was retained , as to the plea for a full grant of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year before . In one of the strongest arguments since the matter was laid before Congress and the people by President Grant , Vandenberg said : - It does not give the Presi- , dent one single additional affirmative power . He can not start anything as a result . He can only stop something long enough to focus the attention of the country on it , and long enough to force two-thirds of the House and Senate to agree to it the vetoed item in spite of him and his reasons , if they should persist in their adverse judgments . Its only harm , if any , would lie in the temporary delay while Congress and the country stop , look and listen . * * * Without ' this item veto the budget * * can become a * * * wooden gun . If President Kennedy could get this authority he would have a most effective , immediate and self-evident means of regularly balancing spending and revenue . And , though Congress once more might decline , he will never know if he does n't make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this to rally public opinion behind it .
