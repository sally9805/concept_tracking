Pride ? " asked Bob Cousy last Saturday evening just minutes before his Celtics were to play the Cincinnati Royals in the gloomy green Garden in Boston . " Of course it 's pride . I 've thought about it all week long and talked to myself about it . ' Better get yourself up , Bob . Better be at your best , Bob . Oscar 's coming to town to play in your arena before your crowd for the first time . ' ' // For 10 seasons Bob Cousy has been the player , the one picked by spectators , the press and his fellow athletes as Mr. Basketball . He does not have the height of a Wilt Chamberlain or even a Cliff Hagan , but he has grace and finesse and supreme skill in shooting , ball handling and team leadership . The man Cousy was concerned with was Oscar Robertson , who , many feel , may one day replace Cousy as the best all-round player in the game . // Ever since Robertson , the 6-foot-5 , three-time All-America from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the professional Royals four weeks ago , he has been on the minds and in the conversations of those who follow basketball devotedly and even of some who only follow it casually . // In his first eight games of the NBA season Robertson apparently had transformed the Royals , a last-place team for the past two years , into an aggressive , cohesive unit . His presence also has raised the Royals ' attendance figures to a height unknown since the franchise was shifted from Rochester to Cincinnati four years ago . Last season , for instance , Cincinnati 's home attendance for 31 games was 58,244 . In just five home appearances this fall the club has attracted 35,241 , and most of these people have been attracted by Oscar . // He had averaged 25 points and 9 assists in his eight games . Still , before he played against Boston the other evening , a claque of doubters remained . All pro basketball players have to be tested in Boston against the champion Celtics , much as all topflight vaudevillians used to be tested at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backcourt as Robertson does , he must be tried on the same floor with Cousy . For Robertson , this was a supreme test . He would be playing in Cousy 's " town , " and Cousy was an All-America when Robertson was 10 years old . Cousy was an NBA All-Star before Robertson got out of junior high school . // Six hours before game time people were lined up for tickets . The Boston Garden 's capacity is listed as 13,909 , and 13,258 showed up  --  a remarkable number this early in the season . // The two main participants came by different routes . Cousy drove from his suburban home in a gray 1960 Cadillac and entered the arena by a " secret " entrance , which keeps him from being trampled by admirers . Robertson walked to the Garden from his hotel , gingerly swinging his gym bag . In the warmups , Robertson concentrated on his jump shot , taking his time and keeping his eye on the basket . Cousy warmed up in his usual nonchalant manner , which makes him look like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As soon as the game got under way each man took control of his team . Both Boston and Cincinnati missed close shots at the basket near the beginning , and then Bill Russell yanked a rebound from the Royals ' backboard and passed to Cousy . Cousy started dribbling the ball up the left side of the court , stopped short and tossed a one-hander , and Boston led 2-0 . Bill Sharman , who was guarding Robertson , pushed Oscar , and Robertson made a foul shot . A few seconds later he made another . After six minutes of sloppy play by both teams , but very good play by Cousy and Robertson , the teams were tied 6-6 . Aside from the performances of Cousy and Robertson , it was clear at this point , and it remained so all evening , that the Celtics were far off form . Indeed , the champions have seldom played so poorly as a team . ( Cousy himself said later , " We have n't played well so far this season . We did n't deserve the two games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sharman shot with his usual brilliance , but there was little unity of attack or defense . Always a running team , the Celtics appeared lead-footed and unprepared for Cincinnati 's determined attack . Perhaps , at this stage of the season , they are complacent and sure of their ability to win over a long season . In any event , in the second quarter Cincinnati pulled far ahead , and though Boston drew to within four points late in the game , no one ever doubted the outcome . The Royals won 113-104 . It was their first victory in the Boston Garden in six years . // Statistically , Robertson held his own with Cousy . Cousy played 45 minutes , scored 27 points , had seven rebounds , seven assists . Robertson played 46 minutes , scored 25 points , had six rebounds , seven assists . // Still the child // In his first meeting with Cousy , Robertson demonstrated that he is every bit as good a pro as his college career gave promise he would be . This does not mean , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ championship of the NBA . Cousy is still the better player , still runs his team with a surer hand . As he did in college , Oscar loses his temper easily , reacts to adverse calls by officials with childish petulance . But he has the eye of a squirrel hunter , the sleight-of-hand dexterity of a magician , the speed of a sprinter . The question is not whether he can make it among the pros . It is , rather  --  how big can he make it ? Unquestionably , he has the ability , if not the temperament , to be " the next Cousy. " // When the game was over , Oscar Robertson was a tired young man . His left ankle , which he had sprained a week earlier , bothered him , and the teen-agers clamoring outside the locker-room door also bothered him . Cousy sat on a bench in the Celtics ' dressing room , physically exhausted and near tears . // Bill Sharman , who played a fine game for Boston and split the guarding assignment on Robertson , perhaps summed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play before , " said Sharman . " He has three or four fakes all in the same move . He 's bigger than most men you usually have to guard in the backcourt . He is a big man with the moves of a really tremendous little man , and he is always ready to whip off a pass that will lead to a basket if a teammate gets free . " // For the rest of the season and for years to come , people will be comparing Robertson and Cousy , much as the new music is compared to the old . After their first meeting , there was still one clear difference between the two . Twenty minutes after Robertson had pushed his way through a group of imploring youngsters on the way back to his hotel , Bob Cousy stood in the light drizzle that was falling on the midnight streets of Boston and signed autographs.
