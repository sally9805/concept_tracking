HE was a soldier who loathed war . <P> He was a politician who abhorred politics . He was a hero who despised heroics . Yet there was nothing inconsistent about Dwight David Eisenhower . As much as any other American of today or yesterday , he was the storybook American . A man of luminous integrity and decency , of steadfast courage and conscience , he embodied in his wide smile , high ideals and down-to-earth speech all the virtues of a simpler and more serene America . <P> A son of the heartland , Ike as President had an intuitive sense of the dangers and opportunities facing the U.S. It was he , when the specter of Communist aggression haunted the Western world , who supported the vision of coexistence with the Russians . It was Eisenhower , the career officer and friend of businessmen , who warned in his last speech as President against " the acquisition of unwarranted influence by the military-industrial complex . " <P> Among the paroxysms of the present , some words he spoke 14 years ago in Rutland , Vt. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in peace with all the world , " said Ike . " To trade with them , to commune with them , to learn from their culture as they may learn from ours , so that our sons may stay at home , the products of our toil may be used for our schools and our roads and our churches , and not for the guns and planes and tanks and ships of war . " <P> A soldier-President in a time of peace , Eisenhower personified the respect of the nation for its military after the war . Yet some of his most eloquent words were directed against the " expenditure of billions on military strength " when the rest of the world desperately needed economic and technological help . Subsequent events have in many respects confirmed his skepticism . When he died last week at 78 , the military 's image was tarnished and its leadership more severely questioned than at any time since Pearl Harbor . <P> The fitful , yet comparatively benign-and even dull-expanse of the " Eisenhower Years " today evokes considerable nostalgia . Eisenhower presided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In considerable part , the harmony was illusory , but it is scarcely less cherished for that . Millions of Americans who mourned Ike 's death last week grieved partly for themselves as well , for their loss of the more ordered , seemingly tranquil period that Eisenhower embodied . <P> The Final Ordeal <P> The end had been months in coming , and Ike 's repeated recoveries from heart attacks and abdominal operations testified to his remarkable vigor . His mind remained undimmed until almost the final hour . A patient at Walter Reed Army Hospital since last May , shortly after his fourth heart attack , Eisenhower suffered three more attacks in June and August . Several times he was in critical condition , only to recover . Last week the bulletins took on a tone of finality . The old soldier 's heart progressively weakened until , at week 's end , it ceased beating . " His passing was peaceful , " said <P> Brigadier General Frederic Hughes , commandant of Walter Reed . " He experienced no distress . "      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
