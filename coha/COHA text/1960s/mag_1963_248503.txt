The king was working in the garden . He seemed very glad to see me . We walked through the garden . This is the queen , he said . She was clipping a rose bush . Oh how do you do , she said . We sat down at a table under a big tree and the king ordered whiskey and soda . We have good whiskey anyway , he said . . . It was very jolly . We talked for a long time . Like all Greeks he wanted to go to America . <P> Thus , in just about the shortest story he ever wrote , Ernest Hemingway 40 years ago described King Constantine and Queen Sophia as they were clinging to the unstable throne of Greece . Last week Constantine 's son , King Paul , was also in his gardened palace at Tatoi , outside Athens , and the whiskey was still good . But unlike his father , Paul did not want to go to America . He wanted to go to Britain , and his Premier would not let him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Refuge . The petty-seeming issue of the trip is actually part of a wider , more complex problem . Premier Constantine Karamanlis , 56 , is a tough , staunchly antiCommunist , pro-NATO politician who in his eight years in office ( the longest tenure for any Greek prime minister ) has given his country stable government and a considerable measure of economic progress . But leftists and liberals attack him for allegedly having rigged the 1961 elections , which returned him to power for a fourth term , and for keeping about 1,000 political prisoners jailed who were arrested more than 15 years ago during the country 's bitter and victorious war with Red insurgents . <P> Communists and well-meaning liberals outside Greece , particularly in Britain , this year started a concerted campaign against the Karamanlis regime , and against the royal family-notably Queen Frederika , who was accused of Nazi connections . Bertrand Russell 's ban-the-bombers joined the fray , and last April , when Frederika was in London for the wedding of her third cousin Princess Alexandra , she was set upon by a crowd of demonstrators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Britain 's anti-Greek chorus was swelled by Lord Beaverbrook , who , for reasons of his own , scurrilously attacked her in his newspapers for her German background . <P> With all this in mind , Karamanlis advised the King-belatedly-against a planned state visit to Britain in July . There might be similar incidents during the trip , he said , and the Greek rightists , resenting left-wing attacks abroad , might make trouble , too , as they did in Salonika recently , where a left-wing member of the Greek Parliament was killed . The King 's plaintive rejoinder was that he had accepted the invitation long ago and it would be ungentlemanly to back out now . The British had promised adequate security . Besides , he did not want to appear to give in to pressure from the left . King Paul was reinforced by pert Queen Frederika who , like her great-great-grandmother Queen Victoria , strongly feels that she knows better than her ministers what is good for her country .                 @ @ @ @
