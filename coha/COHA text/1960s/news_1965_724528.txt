txt Efforts to end the protracted tug of war over legislative leadership broke down this afternoon . Allies of Mayor Wagner refused to switch their support from Anthony J. Travia of Brooklyn , the Mayor 's candidate for Speaker of the Assembly , to Stanley Steingut , also of Brooklyn , the anti-Wagner nominee . They took this stand even though the Mayor 's opponents were ready to help elect Thomas J. Mackell of Queens , whom the Mayor has publicly endorsed , as Senate majority leader . Eey figures in the anti-Wagner faction , enraged , accused Mr. Wagner of welshing on a bargain . They said Assemblyman Moses Weinstein of Queens , who often speaks here for the Mayor , had agreed early today to a Mackell-Steingut settlement , Agreement Called Tentative Slouched in his seat on the Assembly floor , Mr. Weinstein growled " no comment " when asked whetner this was so . Friends of the Queens legislator said , however , that he had made only a tentative agreement , subject to the approval of Mr. Wagner , Mr. Travia and J. Raymond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sources said that Mr. Travia had balked and that Mr. Weinstein had been unable to reach either Mr. Jones or Mr. Wagner . Mr. Travia and Mr. Steingut are rivals in Brooklyn politics as well as in the leadership contest . There was general agreement that a single telephone call from the Mayor giving his assent to the proposed compromise would have ended the deadlock . But the call never came . Mayor Has No Comment A spokesman for the Mayor said last night that Mr. Wagner had no comment to make on this . " The Mayor does n't want Stanley , " one of Mr. Wagner 's intimates said this afternoon . " It 's that simple . He 's not going to crack the whip to get his boys into line for this deal , and that means there just is n't going to be any deal now . " ' Despite the apparent failure of the compromise efforts , prospects that the Republicans would intervene to break the stalemate grew somewhat dimmer . Senator Earl W. Brydges of Niagara , the prospective minority leader , said Senate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to join them . He had indicated last Friday that the G.O.P. would step in early this week . George L. Ingalls of Binghamton , who is expected to be the minority leader in the lower house , said in an interview that he was still opposed to intervention . But he suggested that // the Republicans might reassess their position tomorrow . As a result of these developments , the outlook for an end to the deadlock , which has stalled the Senate and Assembly for 28 days , was highly uncertain . Tomorrow will be the first day of the fifth week of the legislative session . Mr. Mackell remained confi- ' dent , however , predicting that a , Solution was only " hours away . " He said at midnight that he was certain Mr. Wagner would not allow the impasse to persist , beyond this week . On the Senate 's single roll-II call today , Mr. Mackell gainecI two votes , bringing his tctai 14 ? still far short " . the re- , quired 30 . Senator Jack E. Bronston of Queens , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democratic votes . Thetwo Senators who switched ' were Julian B. Erway of Albany and F. Warren Travers of Troy . A third , John E. Quinn of Plattsburgh , had intended to vote for Mr. Mackell , but decided not to at the last minute . " I planned to support Tommy Mackell because I had been told that a deal had been made , " Mr. Quinn said after the Senate recessed . " Then I found out that the Mayor had reneged . He is out to ruin the Democratic party in New York State . " In the Assembly , three ball lots produced the same result ? 51 votes for Mr. Steingut , 35 for Mr. Travia , with two Steingut men absent . Seventysix votes are necessary to win . Th : meeting at which Mr. Weinstein allegedly agreed to a Mackell-Steingut " package " took place in Room 1100 of the De Witt Clinton Hotel , accut-ding to participants . It lasted until s almost 4 o'clock this morning . Among the participants were William H. , the state chairman ; John F. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a power in Queens politics and a former New York City Sanitation Commissioner , and Mr. Weinstein . Mr. Jones had proposed Mackell-Steingut settlement a week ago in a public statement and Mr. Weinstein had said he would seriously consider the proposal . So political observers were inclined to the view that Mr. Travia and his allies in the Assembly and Senate were the principal opponents of such an arrangement . But even their resistance would be expected to crumble if Mr. Wagner asked them to accept a compromise offer . In addition to his animosity toward Mr. Steingut , which has never been fully explained , the ' Mayor was said to be concerned about several minor positions . The anti-Wagner forces have reportedly insisted , for example , upon naming the secretary of the Senate and the counsel to the majority leader . Peter J. Crotty , the Buffalo Democratic leader and a prime mover in the anti-Wagner coali , tion , has indicated that he would like to have his administrative assistant , Joseph Crangle , as secretary of the Senate .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
