Disorganized , depressed , and debilitated , the Southern bloc in the Senate had faint hope of blocking the Administration-backed voting-rights bill . But last week , more for the record than anything else , the Southerners made their ritual try . The last-gasp effort was somehow symbolized by Mississippi 's respected John Stennis , who had scarcely warmed to his subject when he clutched his throat , staggered slightly , fell into his seat . " Get me some water , " he gasped to alarmed Senate aides . As it turned out , Stennis had suffered only a temporary throat spasm - a hazard of the trade - and soon recovered . <P> The fight might already be over were it not for Massachusetts ' Democratic Senator Teddy Kennedy . For weeks Teddy , a spokesman for 38 other Northern liberals , has blocked the bill by trying to force passage of an amendment outlawing poll taxes in state and local elections ( they are already banned in federal elections ) . The Administration and Senate Republican Leader Everett Dirksen oppose the Kennedy proposal on grounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill a black eye ; two weeks ago Dirksen and like-minded colleagues proposed a compromise under which the Attorney General would try to get poll taxes prohibited by the U.S. Supreme Court . Nothing doing , declared Teddy , pushing his amendment again last week for a scheduled vote this week . <P> There had been no doubt that with the support of Dirksen 's Republicans and the Northern Democrats , there were enough votes not only to pass the bill but to get the necessary two-thirds majority to shut off debate . That was still the probability . But Teddy 's move put the outcome in at least a little doubt .
