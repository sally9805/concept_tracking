When the tiny old man walked onstage , moving crabwise around the pianos , the members of the audience at Manhattan 's Town Hall rose in a spontaneous ovation . Igor Stravinsky turned to face them , ducked his head with a shy smile , the light tilting off his glasses . Then he stepped up on the podium to receive a different kind of ovation from four of the U.S. 's leading practitioners of his own art : Composers Lukas Foss , 37 , Aaron Copland , 59 , Roger Sessions , 62 , Samuel Barber , 49 . Seated at four grand pianos , two on each side of the stage , the four were assembled to play Stravinsky 's choreographic cantata Les Noces ( The Wedding ) in ritual homage to the 77-year-old composer they all call their master . <P> There was a precedent for last week 's unusual concert : at Stravinsky 's own re quest , three pianist-composers had played the work at its premiere in Paris in 1923. * Last week 's performance was one of a series of four planned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old man led his forces - in addition to the pianos , four solo singers , a chorus and an assortment of percussion instruments - with a passion and vigor that left his audience breathless . Standing spiderlike on the podium , he raised clenched fists or clawed the air with splayed fingers , setting the hall alive with the violently percussive rhythms , the clipped vocal phrases , the primary colorations that once made his ritualistic evocation of a peasant wedding such a shocking piece of musical theater . But last week 's audience had traveled a long way from the 1920s : its reaction was not one of shock but of reverence in the presence of an acknowledged masterwork . <P> The four participant composers were invited by Stravinsky to appear in the concert last summer . At first they all practiced individually ; Foss , the only professional pianist in the group , worked for " only about five hours , " but Sessions , who rarely performs in public , found that he had to " practice very hard . " The four rehearsed with Stravinsky only three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a little worried about us . " But even Stravinsky was delighted with the way the performance went off , gave each composer a silver-framed , inscribed photograph as a memento . Why had the four interrupted their own busy schedules to undertake Les Noces ? " Stravinsky , " says Lukas Foss simply , " is a composer 's composer .
