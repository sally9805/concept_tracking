txt A one-day boycott of white merchants sponsored by Negro ministers in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn has led to a pledge by the merchants to help improve economic and social conditions in the community . A spokesman for the boycott group , known as the Ministers Movement of Bedf ord-Stuyvesan sant , said the ministers had been successful in getting a promise of cooperation from more than 150 merchants in the area . He said the merchants had answered a questionnaire on their hiring practices with regard to Negroes and had also agreed to give their support to recognized social agencies in the community . Earlier this month the ministers charged in an open letter to the residents in BedfordStuyvesant that the merchants had " turned their backs on the community . " The group said that all its efforts to negotiate reforms had been ignored and that the situation was " injustice and colonialism of the most reprehensible kind . " The ministers then called a boycott against several white merchants in the area . More than 200 persons , including seventy-five ministers , picketed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " economic blackmail " and complained that the ministers were " trying to get others to do their work for them . " However , the merchants held several meetings to discuss the situation . One immediate result was the rejuvena // tion of the Fulton Street Merchants Association of the Bedford Section , Inc. , an orgalization that had been dormant for a number of years . A committee from the association met several times with ' the ministers and agreed to accept their program . The program called for the return of the questionnaires , the acceptance of a list of approved community agencies to be supported and the posting of stickers in the shops of the cooperating business men . ? Wide Support Claimed The spokesman for the ministerial group said that as a result of the agreement , plans for future picketing had been called off . He said the merchants had been almost unanimous in their support and that the " few lagging merchants " would be handled by the association . Bedford-Stuyvesant is one of the city 's most heavily populated sections . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Naval Shipyard to the north and Prospect Park to the south . Fulton Street , which runs east-west , and Nostrand Avenue . northsouth bisect the area and are its busiest thoroughfares .

" Morris Schwartz. whose clothing stores at 1256 and 1272 Fulton Street were picketed by the ministers , contended that the boycott had occurred through a misunderstanding on the part of the clergy . He said that the merchants had been more than willing to work for the betterment of the community but that an inability to get together had led to the picketing .
