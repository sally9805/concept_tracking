After 26 years of firm Somoza family rule , Nicaragua had someone with a different name at the head of its government last week . In much-heralded " free elections , " Luis Somoza , 40 , and Anastasio ( " Tachito " ) Somoza Jr. , 38 , the two brothers who took over the small Central American country in 1956 after the assassination of their father , stuck to their promise that no Somoza would appear on the ballot . But the boys will have a friend in the palace . Elected President by a landslide was former Foreign Minister Ren Schick , 53 , hand-picked choice of the Somozas ' Nationalist Liberal Party . <P> The opposition loudly cried fraud , said that the ballot boxes were stuffed before the polls opened , that the government had printed thousands of duplicate registration cards . In the new regime , Luis Somoza will sit in the Somoza-dominated Senate , tough Tachito will still command the national guard , and the only genuine opposition will have no voice in the legislature . Nevertheless , the U.S. chose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representative democracy . In recent years the Somozas have instituted a few tentative reforms , have even permitted the opposition press to have its say . To encourage all concerned , U.S. diplomats let President-elect Schick know that he would be welcome if he wanted to pay an informal visit to Washington .
