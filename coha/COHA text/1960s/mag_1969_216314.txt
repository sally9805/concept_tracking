AN old axiom at General Electric Co. is that " no operation should be larger than a man can get his arms around . " There are few armfuls quite so huge or potentially so bountiful as G.E . ' s . Its 375,000 employees turn out some 3,000 product lines , including jet engines , nuclear power plants and electric toothbrushes . Now the company has designed an unusual management system to better take hold of some costly problems . <P> The new system does away with the post of president and divides responsibility largely among three vice chairmen , who report only to Chairman Fred J. Borch , the man who gave up the presidency but remains very much the chief executive . The group 's main task is to squeeze more earnings out of G.E . ' s steadily increasing sales . Last week in Manhattan , Borch publicly introduced his triumvirate-William Dennler , Jack S. Parker and Herman Weiss . He also reported that sales reached a record $8.4 billion in 1968-double ten years ago-but profits did not keep pace . A preliminary estimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more than 2% below " 1967 's record $361 million . <P> Entrance Costs . Borch is openly dissatisfied . He says : " We have not been doing as well as we would like in increasing our earnings to match our recent sales growth . " At G.E. , the percentage of profits to sales ran 4.7% in 1966 and 1967 , well down from 1959 's recent record of 6.2% . Last year earnings would have been off even more except for a final-quarter spurt in overall sales , including those of TV sets , appliances and other consumer products , which account for some 25% of G.E . ' s business . <P> The troubles lie mainly in G.E . ' s newer technological fields . The firm had to pay high entrance costs to break into those areas , and profits are farther into the future than managers had expected . The difficulties focus on three areas : <P> COMPUTERS . The company entered the computer field in the mid-1950s and so far has spent hundreds of millions to develop a full family of machines . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 63 ) , it is unlikely to turn a profit before 1970 at the earliest . Another costly venture was G.E . ' s purchase in 1964 of Machines Bull , a French computer manufacturer . G.E . has pumped well over $100 million into the company , most of whose major computer lines had to be scrapped ; Bull has yet to earn a profit for G.E . Some management critics believe that G.E . would have done better if it had set up its own European computer subsidiary instead of buying the ailing Bull . <P> NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS . The company unwisely signed some " turnkey " contracts to supply complete plants at a fixed fee . Managers underestimated the devastating effects of inflation . They reckoned that construction costs would rise only 3% or 4% a year , but they have actually gone up about 12% . Result : losses on those jobs amounted to many millions of dollars last year . G.E . has a big backlog of $2 billion in orders for nuclear plants , but probably will not realize a profit on them for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
