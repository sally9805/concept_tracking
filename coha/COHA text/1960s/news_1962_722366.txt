txt Costs and Revenues The gap between costs and revenues for second-class mail in recent years , however , has been staggering . In fiscal 1961 alone this deficit came to $342 million . At present , publications mailed at the regular rate pay about onequarter of what it costs us to handle them . Under the new rates we have proposed , which have already won approval in the House of Representatives , second-class mail would still pay only about 40 per cent of its costs . A study by J. K. Lasser published by the Magazine Publishers Association indicated that second-class postage consumes roughly 3 per cent of total magazine revenues . A far larger percentage of magazine costs comes from promotional stunts , circulation drives , which involve large quantities of advertising mail , and from the costs of selling advertising . Magazines in recent years have gone to extreme lengths to enlarge their circulation and thereby increase their advertising rates . One large national magazine , for instance , which spends $3,200,000 for postage to deliver the periodical to the subscriber , spends an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mail . As every reader knows , " special " discounts are now the rule , and a substantial portion of all subscriptions are sold at less than the regular rate . The artificially swollen circulation enlarges post office losses on second-class mail , which losses are , of course , ultimately borne by the taxpayer or other mail users . No Destruction Intended The declamations of- some publishers notwithstanding , the Post Office Department does not intend to destroy any magazines . The courts have made it exceedingly clear that , in the absence of violation of law , the merit of a publication is not the Post Office Department 's business . Moreover , I am convinced by the many thriving new publications that have come on to the market that factors other than postal rates determine the success or failure of a magazine . The magazine industry has sought to obscure these facts by reviving ancient and discredited legends about improficiency in the American postal service , actually the world 's largest and most efficient . A few publishers have even suggested ( apparently seriously ) that first-class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same . Ironically , some of the publishers who are the most vehement about the proposed rate increase are the same ones who normally protest the loudest about Government subsidies , demonstrating once again that it all depends on whose ox is being gored . When the evidence is in , however , it is clear that the rising postal costs of a modern postal service must be borne by someone  --  either the taxpayer or the user of the mail . The law , common sense , and a sense of equity all indicate that postal costs should be borne by postal users . RALPH W. NICHOLSON . Assistant Postmaster Genera/ . Washington , April 5 , 1962 . Arrest of Communist Leaders TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : In his letter published April 4 , William B. Putney decries the arrests of Gus Hall and Benjamin Davis , leaders of the United States Communist party , on the rather tenuous basis that this action is tan . tamout to a persecution of a political group and a threat to civil liberties . What Mr. Putney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is not just a " political group " in the normal sense of the term . Ra.ther , it is an integral part of the world Communist conspiracy . As such , its policies are formulated and directed by Moscow with a view to effecting universal Communist hegemony . Recognizing the fact that members of the U. S. Communist party , are agents of " a foreign power , " Congress passed  --  and the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of  --  the Smith and McCarran Acts . Therefore , while I will not impugn Mr. Putney 's motives for his spirited but misguided defense of the Communist party , I am constrained in view of . the empirical evidence available to question his judgment . SYLVESTER J. BRADY , Jr . Brooklyn , April 5 , 1962 . State Land for Parks Large-Scale Program Is Advocated to Increase Holdings TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Your editorial of April 5 " Assault on the Forest Preserve " sensibly opposed any scatter-shot proposal for modifying the " forever wild " section of the State Constitution , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the state 's holdings . Fine , as far as it went , but it did not go far enough . The state not only holds a large number of scattered parcels of land that do not justify protection because they lack scenic or recreational worth ; it also does not have nearly enough land , presently in private ownership , that does have unusual merit and deserves special protection . In some cases such land is held by public-spirited individuals or clubs who permit the public a generous degree of access while maintaining a degree of seclusion that is its own justification . In other cases similar land is vulnerable to development for cottage sites , motels , hotels and other nonconforming uses close to the finest scenery in the East . Additionally , along the route of . the Northway the state is pitiably deficient in lakeshore lands for use as campsites , beaches , picnic areas or for other types of recreation compatible with the simplicity of the Forest Preserve . Too much roadside land , in addition , has been left open to the overcommercialization that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of land acquisition  --  notably on the southern slopes of the High Peak Wilderness , and in the West Canada Lakes Wilderness  --  is urgently needed . The state has been consolidating its present holdings with funds from the recent Park Bond issue . It should enlarge them dramatically before it is too late . Then , and only then , the Forest Preserve will become a viable unit . HAROLD B. BURTON , Commissioner , Adirondack Mountain Authority . Locust Valley , N. Y. , April 5 , 1962 . We agree with Commissioner Burton that acquisition of additional unspoiled land for park purposes is an urgent necessity , and we strongly endorse the action of the State Legislature at its last session in approving issuance of an additional $25 million of bonds for that purpose ( making $100 million in all )  --  a proposition that will be offered to the voters in referendum this fall.  - -  Editor , The Times . Difficulty in Giving Blood TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : No wonder there is an appalling shortage of blood in the New York area ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I telephoned the Red Cross in New York City to volunteer to donate a pint of blood . I found out : ( 1 ) that a person working downtown in Manhattan can not give blood in that area but must journey up to 323 Lexington Avenue ; ( 2 ) that a prospective donor faces a wait at the Red Cross donor center unless he makes an appointment several days in advance ; ( 3 ) that the donor center is open less than six hours a week outside normal working hours , and ( 4 ) that the first question which is asked of an inquiring prospective donor is " Why do you want to give blood ? " The Red Cross should initiate a reasonable and well-advertised program for blood donations , complete with use of volunteer workers to solicit donors and with use of mobile stations if possible . Then I have no doubt that the people of New York would respond to the call . ROGER N. BEILENSON . New York , March 29 , 1962 , New Postal Rates Defended Need to Cut Second-Class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ YORK TIMES The Times on April 4 quoted a spokesman for the publishing industry as saying that " most magazines would have to suspend publication if Congress approved increases in second- and third-class mail rates urged by the Post Office Department . " This kind of hyperbole , typical of recent statements from the magazine industry , may stimulate the viscera of the publishing faithful , but the emotional fall-out serves mainly to becloud the real issue . The Postal Policy Act of 1958 requires the Post Office Department to furnish a sound , nation-wide service at a reasonable cost with the expense equitably shared among its users . To follow the dictates of the *act , the department must aim for a break-even operation , after an adequate allowance is made for services to the public . Although we are obliged to cut our total operating deficit , the Post Offic ' ! Department has never sought , nor does it now seek , to make second-class mail pay for itself . We fully recognize the great social value inherent in widest possible dissemination of newspapers and magazines .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
