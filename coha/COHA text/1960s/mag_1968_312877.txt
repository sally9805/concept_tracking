POWER PLAYS <P> Sir : Your Essay on " Limits of U.S. Power " Feb. 16 is commendable for urging discretion in the use of force . It failed to mention , however , that reliance on force requires superior force , and that in the test of battle no nation is apt to choose defeat without resorting to its maximum weapons . Therefore , deterrence appears plausible during peace , but once conflict begins , reliance on force ultimately provides no outcome other than ignominious defeat , unrelenting stalemate , or nuclear immolation . The nature of war has changed , and futility of the method rather than discretion in its use would have been a truer message . <P> CHANDLER SMITH , M.D. Washington , D.C. <P> Sir : The Essay helps all readers to extricate themselves from a bog of frustration into a more healthy understanding of the power play . Our spines can stiffen a little as we realize that our leaders can better flash the image of a nation prepared to take care of itself with the vast majority of patriotic Americans making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess right much of the time , stand acknowledged all of the time . <P> CHARLES C. CAMPBELL Oklahoma City <P> Sir : Why do we assume so much , worry so much , react so violently so far from our shores , when other nations play it cool ? We must remain strong and be prepared to defend and help the peoples of this hemisphere . We will find this and our own internal problems sufficient to mark the limits of our power . <P> Louis L. MAST Dayton <P> Sir : TIME 'S characterization of those who urged support for the Spanish Republic or for Israel while opposing our involvement in Viet Nam as " capricious " is capricious . Only absolute pacifism-or absolute idiocy-would insist that opposition to one war logically requires opposition to all wars , regardless of political or moral considerations . The Spanish Republic was elected by the Spanish people and was defending its right to exist . The Israelis are in a similar situation .

He has no faith in the people . Men 's lives have to be regulated and controlled by the likes of Galbraith . History records that every demagogue had a plan of social improvement , and then the " ball and chain . " <P> WILLIAM FAY Los Angeles <P> Sir : TIME is wise to attribute " all-purpose bore " as descriptive of Galbraith to an intangible some . It is not likely to have come from anyone who has heard or read the man . To one who disagrees with him , Galbraith may seem platitudinous , or wrong , or oppressively clever , but not , in the interest of fact , a bore . <P> STEPHEN D.
