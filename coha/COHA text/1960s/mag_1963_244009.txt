Like few men or women who wind up in the prisoner 's dock at the Old Bailey , Stephen Ward was educated , charming and gifted . What destroyed him , and turned a merely sordid morals case into the trial of the decade , was none of the conventional or even unconventional deadly sins . It was a compulsive , consuming snobbery . <P> To hobnob with the rich and famous and sprinkle his conversation with first names of peers , maharajahs and Cabinet ministers , the suave , artistic osteopath would go to any lengths , or depths . A man of unbounded vanity himself , he flattered others ' egos with facile pencil portraits , with a gleeful flow of gossip , and a magical ability to cure the aches and pains of famous friends ' famous friends . <P> For coveted acquaintances , versatile Stephen Ward held out the key to an exotic demimonde of teen-age trollops and rarefied sexual rites that seemed more in keeping with Lautrec 's Montmartre than tidy Thamesside . The second son of a country clergyman , he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provincial lasses . " I suppose , " said he , " that I have been one of the most successful men with girls in London since the war . " He used this gift unremittingly for his friends , who rewarded him with a social acceptance that meant far more to him than the financial proceeds of procuring . <P> Revenge Trial . In return for favors past , Stephen Ward remained jauntily confident that Top People would come to his rescue when he was arrested last June and charged with living on prostitutes ' earnings . At his trial , all Britain waited expectantly for the celebrated " surprise witnesses " he had promised . It was not until the seventh day that the crumpling reality finally caught up with him . It came midway in Mr. Justice Marshall 's remorseless , five-hour summing-up of the evidence . " There may be many reasons why he has been abandoned in his extremity , " declared the red-robed judge . " One thing is clear : if Stephen Ward was telling the truth in the witness box , there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who could have come and testified in support of his evidence . " <P> Some did-but not one nob . That night , the dejected Ward summoned a Daily Express reporter to a friend 's apartment and poured out his bitterness . " This , " said he , " has been a political revenge trial . Someone had to be sacrificed , and it was me . One or two people can still vindicate me , but when the Establishment wants blood , you ca n't wriggle out . " <P> Stephen Ward did wriggle out . Ninety minutes before he was to appear in court for the last day of his trial , he was found purple-faced and unconscious in the Chelsea apartment where he had been staying with a friend . On a table beside him were scattered a dozen letters to friends and acquaintances . On the floor lay an empty vial that had contained 100 Nembutal tablets-a drug very different from the kind he had long been taking for pleasure . While doctors worked to save his flickering life at St. Stephen 's Hospital , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jury . That evening , after deliberating only 4 hours , the jurors found Stephen Thomas Ward guilty on two counts of living in part on the immoral earnings of prostitutes .
