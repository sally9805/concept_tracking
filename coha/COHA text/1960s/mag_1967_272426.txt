" Every time they opened a new superhighway , " said George Akerson , publisher of the Boston Traveler , " we got kicked in the teeth . If you go home on a train , you read a newspaper . If you go in a car , you do n't . " <P> Akerson also faced a problem that is rare in U.S. cities these days : plenty of rival newspapers . Three newspapers are published in Boston each morning , and three competed with the Traveler in the afternoon . No fewer than four separate managements cranked out 19 editions each weekday . Overcome by it all , Akerson announced last week that the Trav- eler will stop its presses for good on July 10 , after 142 years of uninterrupted publication . <P> Rumors of trouble at the Herald-Traveler Corp . have circulated through Boston for almost a decade . Once the Boston paper , the Herald now trails the morning Globe ( circ. 231,300 ) by 77,000 copies , while the Traveler , which held a 74,500 lead over the afternoon Globe in 1947 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We found increasing difficulty in the p.m. field , " said Akerson . " In the afternoon you 're fighting against the tide . " Both papers were losing money , but the Traveler 's losses made up the bulk of the total , which began in 1962 at about $150,000 and rose to well over $1,000,000 last year . <P> In 1963 , former Herald Publisher Robert Choate considered selling out to the Globe , then changed his mind . Akerson , then the Herald-Traveler 's assistant publisher , joined forces with Choate and newspaper and magazine distributor Harry Garfinkle , largest Herald-Traveler stockholder , to head off the sale . Moving up to the publisher 's office , Akerson hired a science and medicine expert , expanded regional coverage , removed ads from the front page and hired new , younger reporters . He reversed the Traveler 's circulation decline , but he never managed to eliminate a pollyanna tone that blunted the paper 's point and pertinence . Says Boston University Journalism Professor Robert Baram : " It was not so much a newspaper as a happy views @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Herald and Traveler staffs , prune the deadwood , plow back savings in production and distribution costs into a new morning paper , which will be called the Herald Traveler . By consolidating and improving the product , Akerson hopes he will have a better chance of competing with the Globe for Boston 's advertising dollars .
