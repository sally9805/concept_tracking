Venice is the greatest of museum cities , and it guards its monuments jealously . In fact , the city has largely resisted new architecture ever since the faade that closed the Piazza San Marco was built during Napoleonic days . Frank Lloyd Wright in 1953 tried to build a modest hanging-gardens-type palazzo on the Grand Canal , but civic fathers rejected the design as presumptuous . Now another brash suitor , France 's Le Corbusier , has come to woo a place in the city that seems determined to sink into the sea unchanged . <P> " Corbu , " of course , is remembered as the man who would have started improving Paris by demolishing its most historic part . But that was in 1922 ; the master is now 78 and mellowed . He has flattered his intended , asking , " Have you observed that Venice is gay and proud , never menaced , never shoved about , never disturbed ? " Returning recently , he found Venice " a modern city made for man , without the oppression of machine civilization . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Corbu 's world wide reputation ( TIME cover , May 5 , 1961 ) , inclined Venice 's municipal hospital head to invite Corbu to replace the old hospital of Sts . John and Paul . <P> The only convenience that the Renaissance structure now has is its location just across the lagoon from the cemetery . But since it , like everything else , is a monument , the new $11 million hospital will rise elsewhere : in the slummish San Giobbe sector , where the city slaughterhouse stands , and also the gateway to the city . The available land is nearly 7 acres , but Corbu plans to extend the hospital for nearly five more acres across the water . Ironically , the man who first put modern buildings on stilts , or pilotis , as he calls them , now can put them to their most logical use . " The silhouette of Venice is sacred , " declared Corbu as his model for the hospital was displayed in the city 's Institute of Architecture . The roof height will nowhere exceed 50 ft. , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sandwiched between the sacred skyline and the sea is a series of enough multilevel pavilions , each caring for 50 patients , to make a 1,200-bed " machine for healing . " The top floor is reserved for patients , sequestered in 10-ft. by 10-ft. rooms with skylights . <P> Job 's Patience . Instantly critics snapped that the sick need a view . Corbu 's partisans reply that the bedridden prefer a supine view of blue sky , birds and stars . All that the hospital must do to grow is go to sea , expanding , said the architect , " like an open hand . " There is no faade or front door : ambulance boats can dock conveniently under the hospital at gondola ports . As much an adaptation of the Swiss lake villages , which Swiss-born Corbu knows well , as a ducal palace or a gondola garage , the design should please Venetians . Yet , however harmonious this adventuring architecture , there is still much bureaucratic approval to survive . San Giobbe hospital refers , of course , to Job . And for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build in Venice , Job 's patience is an ideal .
