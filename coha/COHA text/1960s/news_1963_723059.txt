txt The United Arab Republic ( Egypt ) , Syria , and Iraq have reaffirmed their intention to establish a federal relationship among themselves despite the %trains that have come into the open during the past 10 days between UAR President Nasser and the Baath Party in Syria and Iraq . But the details and the divisions of power within the association have still to be worked out . That is the meaning of the announcement in Cairo Monday night after two days of talks between representatives of the governments of the three countries . The statement by the head of the Executive Council in the UAR , Aly Sabry. reported that the three delegations had agreed on the principles for a federal union and that a subcommittee would begin discussions Tuesday on the drafting of a national charter for it . Harder Bargaining There was no indication of what the principles were , and in view of many observers , the filling in of the details will probably result in harder bargaining than did the talks preceding the reaffirmation of the declaration of intent . The sharp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Nasser and the Baathists had , in the eyes of some , endangered the prospect of an early union among the three countries and almost certainly given aid and com fort to those forces in the Mid- dle East opposed to the reform-minded governments now in power in Baghdad and Damascus as well as in Cairo . Against this background , the delegations which assembled in Cairo on Sunday must have felt the need to remove doubts . Hence Mr. Sabry 's announcement . Syria Most Fluid Of the three countries involved . Syria has perhaps the most fluid situation , and the announcement could also have been intended to steady things there . It was in Syria that the differences between Mr. Nasser and the Beath Party found most obvious expression , despite the virtual agreement of the two on long-term aims . Whereas the government that came to power in Iraq through last February 's coup was controlled by Baathists , the new revolutionary government in Syria represented a coalition between the Baath Party and non - Baathist pro - Nasser grou ps . Mr. Nasser partly blames @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Egyptian-Syrian union into which they had coaxed him three and a half years earlier . He therefore did not take well the suggestions from them that he would have to make concessions to their thinking in any revived union linking Egypt with Syria and Iraq . Reservations Listed In particular , the Baathists have insisted that there must be " collective leadership " in such a union ; that each participant in the union must be left relatively free to run its own affairs ; and that a one-party system on the current Egyptian model must not be imposed on Syria and Iraq . There are indications that Mr. Nasser , profiting from the lessons of the unsuccessful Egyptian-Syrian union , recognizes the wisdom of leaving Syrians and Iraqis to run their own affairs , since internal conditions in both countries differ from those in Egypt . But he would not want to be trapped on any situation where he ( or his country ) would have to foot the bill for a decision taken by the Syrian or Iraqi Baathist leadership in which he had had nc part . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and only the final details of the proposed union can show how it has been resolved .
