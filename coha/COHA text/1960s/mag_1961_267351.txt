The most powerful woman in Russia , and hence the official ideal for all others , is Minister of Culture Ekaterina Furtseva , 50 , wife , mother , only female on the all-powerful Party Presidium-and one of Nikita Khrushchev 's closest chums . <P> Last week Ekaterina ( Khrushchev calls her Katya ) dropped into London for a visit , and it was obvious that the Russian ideal was changing . Down 15 Ibs. ( from 150 ) , her ash-blonde hair brushed back in a casual sweep , newly chic in a slim , turquoise linen suit , Katya asked the curious women reporters who greeted her at the airport : " What do you think I should wear to dine with an earl ? " <P> <P> This was a far cry from the girl who won Khrushchev 's affection and powerful support . A onetime textile worker and a tough organizer for the Komsomol youth groups , Ekaterina joined the party secretariat of a Moscow district in 1942 and there met Khrushchev , after which promotions came fast . After Stalin 's death , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full membership of the Presidium in 1957 ( and got back her husband , who had been shipped off as ambassador first to Prague , then to Belgrade ) . Her daughter married the son of Secretary of the Communist Party Frol Kozlov . Until Khrushchev started taking Wife Nina along on his trips , Katya functioned as Communism 's unofficial First Lady , accompanying Khrushchev to Peking , Prague and Vienna . In those days , Katya was a bit of a juggernaut-shoulders padded , hair pulled back severely in a bun , not a trace of makeup . But Katya had professional as well as social talents in Khrushchev 's eyes-she rallied the Moscow party machinery firmly behind him in his 1956 purge of old-line Stalinists who had tried to overthrow him . <P> <P> At some point in her travels , culture began to rub off on Katya . She turned up at almost every performance of foreign artists in Moscow . Under Katya , cultural exchanges with the West have shot up sharply . <P> Then the padded shoulders and bun disappeared . Last month she dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Paris for a chat with Andre Malraux . On her current junket , she touched down in Denmark , Iceland and then London , where the earl in question was the music-loving Earl of Harewood . For the dinner , Katya finally chose that staple of feminine fashion , " the little black dress " ( mascara , no lipstick or jewels ) . " Our ambition , " she said , " is to become even more elegant than you . " How had she reduced ? " Tennis , the secret of a good figure . Diet ? I never diet . I eat everything . " With that , she flew back to Moscow , where the knowing party climbers hang on her every word , explaining : " Whatever Furtseva says , Khrushchev means . "
