Mr. Monro , dean of Hail ard College from 1958 to 1967 , is now director of freshman studies at Miles College , Birmingham , Ala . Birmingham At Miles College , in Birmingham , I am responsible for trying to develop and conduct a freshman program for some 300 young men and women , all black , who come to us from the local schools in Alabama It is fifteen years since the great Brown decision of the Supreme Court ordered the desegregation of the schools , but hardly one of our 300 freshmen has ever had a white teacher before , or been to school with white classmates . Alabama is now fiftieth on the list of states in per-pupil expenditure for schooling ( about $400 per child per year , as compared with about $1,000 in New York State ) , and in the South ? as in the North  --  black schools seem to get the short end of the budget allocations So it is no surprise that after twelve years of school , the students coming to Miles seem to be , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mathematical and language skills . 434 I recall very well that in my previous incarnation , when I was a dues-paying member of the white community , I had a hard time taking seriously the notion that I and my well-meaning , liberal-minded , church-going friends were bigoted racists . And a couple of years back when I first heard young black people accusing us good white folks of " genocide , " I considered the accusation dangerous , and also rather paranoid and absurd . But I see things somewhat differently now . I find it a particularly rich experience to live and work in a black community , mainly because in the black community you develop a clarity of vision about the realities of American life . I have learned how important it is to listen to the metaphors with which black poets have tried to describe the pain that they feel . For example , one day six years ago a strong , gentle young black man , a Harvard undergraduate , laid on my desk a copy of W.E B. Du Bois ' Souls of Black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know what I 'm thinking , and what makes me move , then you must read this book " So , of course , I read it , and admired it in an intellectual way . But now , six years later , THE NATioN/October 27 , 1969 I know what my young friend meant and what an honor he conferred on me by inviting me in . Day by day , in my new incarnation my respect grows for W.E B Du Bois As a Harvard man , I find it incredible that Harvard had Du Bois as an undergraduate and gifted graduate student seventy years ago , and let him go It sometimes seems to me that our national history might have been different otherwise . But Harvard saw Du Bois as a Negro and let him go And it seems to me a great national tragedy and loss , and characteristic of us as a people , that we now categorize Du Bois as a Communist , and so turn away from a life and work which would help us to understand our national guilt and our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Du Bois : It is as though one , looking out from a dark cave in a side of an impending mountain , sees the world passing and speaks to it ; speaks courteously and persuasively , showing them how these entombed souls are hindered in their natural movement , expression , and development ; and how their loosening from prison would be a matter not simply of courtesy , sympathy , and help to them , but aid to all the world . One talks on evenly and logically in this way but notices that the passing throng does not even turn its head , or if it does , glances curiously and walks on It gradually penetrates the minds of the prisoners that the people passing do not hear , that some thick sheet of invisible but horribly tangible plate glass is between them and the world . They get excited , they talk louder They gesticulate . Sonic of the passing world stop in curiosity : these gesticulations seem so pointless ; they laugh and pass on . They still either do not hear at all , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do not understand . Then the people within may become hysterical They may scream and hurl themselves against the barriers , hardly realizing in their bewilderment that they are screaming in a vacuum , unheard , and that their antics may seem funny to those outside looking in . They may even , here and there , break through in blood and disfigurement , and find themselves faced by a horrified , implacable , and quite overwhelming mob of people frightened for their own very existence . What makes Du Bois ' metaphor of the black people imprisoned in the cave , behind the plate glass window , so terrible is that it is still true , today , right down to the bloody bit about what happens to the occasional black man who breaks through the barrier and runs into the mob of frightened whites : Other poets have produced other terrible metaphors for our national curse . Langston Hughes spoke of Harlem , " here on the edge of Hell , " " where a nickel costs a dime . " Hughes , too , saw racial prejudice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he said , " the wall rose slowly , slowly , between me and my dream , dimming , hiding the light of my dreams , rose until it touched the sky  --  the wall . " For Richard Wright the terrible thing that thrust in between him and the world was the vision of a horrid lynching , a black man burned , and around the scene " upon the trampled grass . . . buttons , dead matches , THE NATioN/October 27 , 1969 butt ends of cigars and cigarettes , peanut shells , a drained gin-flask , and a whore 's lipstick . " Ralph Ellison 's great metaphor was the Invisible Man , and I remind you that , though we usually think of Ellison as a moderate and literary man , the first thing his invisible man does , as we meet him , is beat within an inch of his life a blue-eyed white man who bumped and insulted him one dark night . Ellison has his invisible man run from the scene " laughing so hard I feared I might rupture myself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , Jonathan Kozol , who tried to teach in the segregated black schools in Boston , and was fired for having his students read Langston Hughes 's poem , " Ballad of the Landlord " Kozol called his book , Death at an Early Age , and his subtitle was : The Destruction of the Hearts and Minds of Negro Children in the Boston Public Schools . It seems wise to try to communicate what I am trying to say by resorting to metaphor , because the plain statistical facts of our racism are so well known , have been so well known so long , and have so little effect . In this free and rich society , if a man is black , just because he is black , this is his table of probabilities : Twice as many black babies as white will die before age 1 ; because they are black . Four times as many mothers will die in childbirth ; because they are black , Between the ages of 30 and 60 , twice as many blacks will die as whites . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of school before 6th grade , and about one-half the chance that he will finish high or college . In the South , only 15 per cent of young black men and women of college age will get to college , as compared to 50 per cent for young white people ; this means that each year some 75,000 black young men and women of college ability , reaching college age , just do not get to college at all ; because they are black . The tabulation goes on , as long as it is familiar . We could go into the matter of jobs , of income levels , of opportunity for real management positions ; we could go into housing , what it 's like to be confined in a ghetto ; we could go into the bloody figures of the military draft for fighting in Vietnam , and the great white sanctuary of college and graduate school ; we could document the behavior of white police in black neighborhoods . In my freshman Social Studies class at Miles I must each day try to explain the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and women , who , it develops , already know more about the dirty side of that system , and how it really operates , than I can ever know One big , strong , black young man in that class whom I have come to respect particularly is Fred Rogers . Mr. Rogers is a steady man of 24 , who has served five years in the Army , three of them in Vietnam . He knows all about the percentage of Negro combat troops in Vietnam , and the high percentage of Negro young men in the daily body counts , He lives in a part of town where there is no sewage system , and no paved streets ; where black people live in rickety shacks , Negro schools are third rate , and where the prospect is , if he finished on 435 through college , he can hope maybe some day to be a schoolteacher , if he is careful not to offend anybody . In Alabama he would make better money as a carpenter , or in the steel mills . But he has no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commensurate with his power as a man  --  his intelligence , his energy , his force . Fred Rogers as an expert on the brutality of the American social and economic system . He comes to class each day , sits down front , and stares at me unblinking and unsmiling as I try to explain to him and has black classmates how the American social system works . Mr. Rogers is unfailingly polite and does not say much , but when he does come on , it is like a ton of bricks . And , of course , his presence tends to affect the whole class , my own preparation and presentation of the material , and the response from the other students . I am sure that as a white man trying to present this material , I often annoy and frustrate Mr. Rogers . He seldom shows his annoyance , which is a tribute to his patience and manners . But in that class we are always operating on the edge of annoyance and frustration , and because it is tough and tense , it is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class we were discussing the phenomenon of " culture , " when Mr. Rogers weighed in . " As I listen to this , " he said , " it seems to me that I am a man living in two cultures . Or anyway , I was brought up and I live in a black culture ; and to get along , I have to learn how to cope with the white culture . And these two cultures are different , in fact one seems very hostile ; and it is damned hard . " Given what he has been through in Vietnam , what he lives with every day in Bessemer , and the struggle he faces in the years ahead just to get a decent , self-respecting job in our society , I must say I find Mr. Rogers incredibly moderate . What he has been through , and what he confronts , just because he is black , entitles him to regard me , or any other white man , categorically , as the enemy , as part of the evil force oppressing every hour of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ College and the Birmingham black community  --  is that Fred Rogers and his classmates , and parents , have not yet come to hate White people categorically . They are still moderate ? tough and ' independent and alert and taking no nonsense  --  but still willing to talk and listen and work through institutions . The moderation is not for eternity ; we are in a terrible race with the erosion of good will in the black community . This fact , already all too visible in the North , is now becoming visible in the South . By a miracle , we still have time , but not much time , and the opportunity to do what must be done is slipping away . Do I mean by all this that " integration is dead " ? That is a central question . In an interview with Look Mrs. Betty Shabazz , the widow of Malcolm X , said : " Blacks have been trying to integrate for nearly four centuries , and they have failed . Integration has failed . We have been forced into separate neighborhoods and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own way . Now we blacks are going to rule ourselves . " I note certain similarities between Mrs. Shabazz 's posiLion and Fred Rogers ' position , and what may be a difference . Fred Rogers is planning , somehow , for all the difficulties , to break through and make it in the general national community ; and he is planning , at the same time , to turn his energies and talents to the strengthening of the black community . He sees a strong black community as a power base from which he can hope to have some impact on the white community , for himself and his own career , and for others . He would not call what he wants " integration " ; what he wants is equality of education , of job opportunity ; he wants justice , a say in the government , and freedom to move about like any other self-respecting citizen . There 's an important difference between " equality " and " integration . " For one thing , the idea of integration , as most white people think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white people cold , hypocritical , inhumane , selfish , impersonal , driven by altogether stupid ambitions involving status and material wealth  --  in a word depersonalized and " hung up . " After two years at Miles College , living in the black community of Birmingham , I think Mr. Rogers sees the white cornmuAtty just about right . What is more important , Fred Rogers has begun to learn how the United States really works . What white America respects is not weakness but strength ; America respects not rational pleas for help but rather any serious threat to vital parts of the system ; and most particularly any threat to profits and sacred property . I am old enough to remember the great national labor struggles in the 1930s . We learned then that our great industries ? Ford , General Motors , big steel  --  were not responsive to the needs and concerns of the individual workers , until the workers , with a prolonged , brutal effort , pulled their thing together , and developed the institutional strength to stop the great factories and shut off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he got respect . He became then a respectable threat ; an organized , institutional threat . The American black community will start making real progress in the United States when it discovers the analogy bptween its own position and the position of unorganized labor a half century ago . It will not work in our society to think of the black community as a separate nation : the metaphor is just wrong . But it will work to think of the black community as ' a great , national , black union . Let me push the analogy one step further . Whereas labor unions were in a position to command respect and attention because they could , and did , close down factories , the black community is in a position to command respect and attention because it can shut down great cities . That threat strikes a nerve in the power structure : it makes its money in the great cities . So , I believe very strongly in some form of Black Power . I think that the only way any group of people gets along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I observe that our special national genius seems to be the organizing of social institutions , large and small , to accomplish all sorts of purposes . And I observe further that the black people have never gotten seriously into this universal national game , this organizing of effective units of institutional power . A lot of people I meet , white and black , are scared by the idea of Black Power . I am bound to say that Black Power scares me a whole lot less than industrial power or military power , or the unholy marriage of those two ; and scares me a good deal less than what we experience in Alabama as Wallace power , or in Chicago as Daley power . Indeed , it seems to me that the most serious social consequences for us lie . not in developing institutional strength and responsibility in the black community  --  black unity  --  but in the continuation of a condition of black powerlessness. accompanied by tokenism and oppression . That way surely lie frustration and deepening anger , and terrible social explosions . One obvious consequence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , anyway  --  is that as a society we should realize the importance of the predominantly Negro colleges , and find ways to make them strong and effective . There are some 120 junior and senior black colleges , almost all in the South , and they enroll more than 125,000 students , something more than half of all the black students going to college in the United States . This percentage is slowly diminishing as formerly all-white colleges warm up to their responsibilities . But the importance of colleges like Miles increases month by month . In his very constructive and thoughtful study of the black colleges published in 1965 , Earl McGrath noted that some 40 per cent of the students come from families with incomes below $4,000 ; indeed 70 per cent come from families with incomes below $6,000 . In the country at large , 80 per cent of all students going to college have family incomes above $6,000 . The black colleges are reaching a seriously disadvantaged population that no other colleges even know about , much less can reach . I have already said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twelve years of school , to be on the average at the 9th- or 10th-grade level . These figures are not at all atypical , and they do not say a word as to the intelligence or academic potential of the young peole ; the figures testify only to grossly inadequate schooling . And I noted earlier that each year in the South some 75,000 black boys and girls who have the potential to go to college never get there . This is the problem that the Negro colleges have been working on , day after day , devotedly , at bare subsistence levels of support , for a hundred years . And it will continue to be the big job for the black colleges in the years ahead . It is not a job the fast-moving , rich white colleges and universities can do , at least not by themselves . My central point here is that all the colleges in America , black and white , working together , have a most serious task cut out for them in the years ahead . How they should be working together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cooperative efforts are under way , and we are learning from them . Principally the nation must become aware that the black colleges , for a1I their weakness and shortcomings , will be essential to this effort . They are geographically positioned to be in closest contact with some of the most needy areas . They are accustomed to working with students who are badly prepared for college , and to moving them along to graduate school . Thus they are critical centers of contact and of a growing expertise . associations between black colleges and white colleges . From what I have said about the educational effort in the colleges and the importance of community organizaton , it follows that I am entirely sympathetic with the insistence of our black communities that they be given control over the schools that serve black children in black neighborhoods . To paraphrase Betty Shabazz on this matter : " White people would consider it insane if black people tried to run white schools Now it 's time for black people to make as much sense , and to take charge of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is the clearest example I know of white racism , of white people 's built-in sense of superiority , to assume that whites should have charge of black children 's education . All the facts cry out in the other direction White people have made schools a weapon of oppression against black children . Read Jonathan Kozol 's Death at an Early Age . Consider rural Alabama . The U S Civil Rights Commission last year revisited sixteen rural counties in southern Alabama , an impoverished farm area with a population of some 350,000 , about three-fifths black . They found , among other things , that for people over 25 , the median grade level of school-leaving for white people was eleven grades , and for black people 5 5 grades . The commission found also that , fifteen years after the Supreme Court decision ordering desegregation of schools , only 2 per cent of the black students were attending formerly all-white schools I would add that the same percentage , about 2 per cent , or less , holds also in metropolitan Jefferson County , around Birmingham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , virtually all white schools were valued and insured for more than $100,000 . No black school was valued above $20.000 and two were insured for $750 . The commission asked the State Superintendent of Education , Mr Ernest Stone , why Clarke County has white schools worth $100,000 and black schools worth $750 . Here is Mr. Stone 's verbatim reply : " Well , I would assume that the building which is assessed for $110,000 is a more expensive building than the one that is assessed for $750 . That would be a reasonable assumption . Now , the state has nothing to do with the building of either one of the buildings . All the plans were promulgated by the local school system . It is a little something that we call democracy and we think it has worked pretty well " This response will be something to think about if the federal government takes seriously the fervent demands of the South that it send to the states for education " blocks of money with no strings " I do not find it strange or surprising , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angry at white racist management of their children 's schools and should demand to run the schools themselves . In the distribution of funds and people for the new effort of schooling , it is oritical that we place a great deal of emphasis on strengthening the work in the early grades , in fact strengthen efforts like Head Start , to get the children started before age 6 . It is evident , as Ivor Kraft noted in a recent ? article in The Nation " Second-Class Schools in a First-Class Power , " May 26 that improving our elementary schools will be a most difficult job . Most schools and most teachers put an monis on rote learning , on conformity , on obedience and order . And most teachers are little prepared to confront racial attitudes , either within themselves , or in the very young Further , as Kraft observes , elementary schools do n't have an internal force pressing hard for changes , as do the colleges So 1 sense that another task for our colleges and universities , as responsible members of the nation 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way they can what goes on in the grade schools . We must strive now harder than ever for desegregated education . I do not use the word " integrated , " for it has certain connotations of cultural assimilation , and " integration " of that sort is simply over . But " desegregation " is clear . It means requiring the end of separate school systems , and educating young white people and young black people in the same schools , so that they can educate each other No other item on the national agenda is more important The Supreme Court reached the right decision in the Brown case of 1954 , but for the wrong reason . The Court spoke of the oppression and discouragement that fell upon the minds of young black students by the mere fact of separation , and of the need to relieve this circumstance if black children were to receive the even break guaranteed by the Constitution What the Court would have done better to stress is the sickness of soul that descends upon white youngsters when they are separated and segregated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superiority There may seem to be a contradiction between what I said earlier about Black Power , about black control of black schools , and the need for desegregation that I now stress . The contradiction seems to me more apparent than real We must arrive at a standoff , a confrontation , between black and white America based , not on appeals to generosity and tolerance but on conditions of real strength and self-respect and self-awareness on either side , and an awareness of and respect for the other man The idea of a black " nation , " the use of that word " nation , " contains a helpful suggestion . In this crazy world a certain categorical respect attaches to membership in a recognized nation state ; a foreign nationality carries more esteem , indeed , than white America renders its black citizens I do not go all the way with black nationalists , because the metaphor becomes too confused when you think of a nation scattered in pockets large and small across 3,000 miles and surrounded by yet another nation . But the idea of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in righteous anger , and determined to work as one , is just right in the United States . It can become the basis for a position of real social strength and pride . Such a development does not at all rule out desegregation , or other contact with the white community . On the contrary , it assures that desegregation and interracial contact will produce mutual respect . Another thing we must do if we are to have a rational future , is to teach all our people , young and old , in school and out , the long , tortured , truthful story of racial confrontation and oppression in our country . The failure of the schools , and especially the colleges , to see the central importance of this dreadful theme to our national life  --  and to deal with it  --  is the surest sign we have of the essential insensitivity , the habit-ridden conformity , of our educational establishment . We teach every exotic thing you can think of in our great universities : Northern Welsh Literature , Middle Irish , Origins of European Romanticism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Empire , the Minor Works of Rousseau . And the Lord knows what idiotic refinements of established professional specialties in the sciences . In our schools we devote months on end to the Iliad , that poeticized siory of a two-penny comic-opera war fought 3,000 years ago in the Dardanelles . But our learned faculties can not see  --  as history or tragedy  --  our own terrible racial epic , one of the most agonized struggles in human history , involving millions of men and women over nearly four centuries . That is , they can not see it until the black students  --  hke the G.M. workers of thirty years ago  --  stop the works . The students are dead right , and let us get on with it . Like most Amei teams , I have been worried that the new student rebellions would produce an uncontrollable backlash ; that we would have to grind our way through a long period of repression , and then further response from students , and then still further repression by police and National Guard We must look forward to a difficult period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where faculties have yet to discover that the history of black people in America is a topic demanding some priority over ancient Greek dialects . But I am pleased and encouraged that the crucial confrontation is taking place in the colleges and universities , which , for all their conservatism and stuffiness , are still the most responsive large institutions left in this country . We shall go through some bad experiences on the campuses  --  at least as bad as those of the last two years . But we shall achieve , also , THE NATioN/October 27 , 1969 some constructive results . We are having some already . I was much impressed by President Morris Abrams ' thoughtful handling of the Brandeis sit-in ; and by President Levy 's determination that , come what may , the University of Chicago wants to work through to solutions with its own students , without calling in the law . There are special reasons for not calling m the law of Chicago to help solve student problems , but the underlying principle is nonetheless sound . I am most of all heartened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , working its way to a series of suggestions as to how Harvard should proceed to develop a black studies program . To arrive at its recommendation , the faculty committee met regularly with black student groups and their representatives , and the report shows on every page that the faculty was listening and learning . Two passages from Harvard came through like music in the black community ? The absence of course offerings in many areas of Afro-American culture is emphatically a matter of more than academic or pedagogical concern to black students . Indeed , it seems likely that the absence of such offenngs is the single most potent source of the black students ' discontent at Harvard The lack of such courses can strike the black students as a negative Judgment by Harvard University on the importance of these areas of knowledge and research , and , by inference , on the importance of the black people themselves More pointedly , there is the problem faced by the black student , who , coming to Harvard , may feel more or less consciously , something of a dislocation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressed the need to legitimize , inwardly as well as publicly , their presence at Harvard white other blacks remain in the ghetto , confronting its problems , bearing its burdens Herein lies one of the major sources of the demand for courses relevant to the black experience . What the black student wants is an opportunity to study the black experience and to employ the intellectual resources of Harvard in seeking solutions to the problems of the black community  --  so that he will be better prepared to assist the community in solving these problems Such educational opportunities at Halyard would help the black student to Justify his separation from the larger black community  --  and would attest that the separation was by no means radical or permanent . And a final statement from the same report ? In our opinion , the status quo with respect to Afro-American Studies at Harvard is not satisfactory Quite a number of courses recognize the existence of black men in the development of America , quite a bit of expertise is already available However , merely recognizing black men as integral segments of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealing with 25 million of our own people with a special history , culture , and range of problems It can hardly be doubted that the study of black men in America is a legitimate and urgent academic endeavor . If this be so and if we are determined to launch this field of study successfully , farsighted goals and programs are required These goals and programs should maintain and even raise academic standards , should avoid considering the black experience in isolation ; and finally , should have meaning for all serious students  --  black and white . Amen , brothers ! Amen ! 439
