 | TEENAGE SUICIDE : A SPECIAL REPORT " Dear Mom and Dad , You have to understand this is the only way out for me . " The note had been written on a piece of brown wrapping paper and pinned to the kitchen bulletin board . Relentlessly its childish scrawl continued : " I suppose it is n't your fault you do n't love me . Nobody does . I do n't know why you 're always picking on me . Love forever , Bob . P.S. Please feed Blackie for me . He gets half a can of meat and two cups of kibble . P.P.S. Please call Mr. Carson and tell him I wo n't be able to deliver the papers any more . Thanks again . " Bob was just two months short of his fifteenth birthday when he shot himself twice in the head with his father 's .22 caliber pistol . His mother and older brother found him lying in a pool of blood in front of the sink . Before his mother . temporarily mindless with shock , went to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a length of paper towel and made the first gesture toward tidying up her kitchen . We talked to Bob 's parents in their comfortable seven-room house in a New York City suburb . His mother said brokenly . " As long as I live I 'll never understand it . What makes a boy from a good family do such a thing ? " While we were preparing this article , a schoolteacher in a small New England town told us about another teenager who had recently died from deliberately inhaling carbon-monoxide @# @# @#  | fumes . She knew him as an attractive , intelligent , affectionate and lovable youngster ? the kind who prompts people to say , " He had everything to live for . " For American adolescents , fourteen to nineteen years of age , suicide is the fifth-ranking cause of death . More youngsters commit suicide than die from tuberculosis , diabetes , appendicitis or leukemia . Not counting accidents , it is the most frequent cause of death on college campuses . It is small comfort to parents to point out that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the approximately 20,000 suicidal deaths each year , " only " 300 occur among teenagers . The alarming facts are that youngsters make 15,000 yearly attempts at suicide serious enough to require medical attention , and both suicides and attempted suicides in this age bracket have increased by 25 percent in the past decade . Many more suicidal cases are tactfully reported as " accidents . " Yet teenage suicide is a hush-hush area in which horror and shame limit the spread of information . If Bob , the boy who shot himself , had died of some seldom-encountered disease , his family would have set out to find out how and why . They would have had their water supply tested , Bob 's school investigated , the local hamburger stand inspected . But they can not face the fact of Bob 's suicide . Their minister says , " Because their child died by his own hand , they feel he must surely have been miserably unhappy . If he was unhappy , the parents think they were to blame . Naturally they ca n't bear that burden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " Even professional people familiar with adult suicide find that teenage suicide presents radically different problems . One is implicit in the fact that for every young person who takes his own life , fifty others attempt to do so . Psychiatrists also say that hundreds of thousands of young people ? a far greater proportion than among adults ? at some time seriously think about suicide . The idea that adolescents , so often thought of as too much given to self-seeking pleasure , are far more prone to think about or try suicide than grownups is a startling one . Dr. Howard Jacobziner , Assistant Commissioner of Health for New York City , reports that if the same rate existed in the adult population one out of every 200 grownups would have taken an overdose of sleeping pills , thrown himself in the river or otherwise made a police-recorded attempt to end his own life . The meaning of these figures , Dr. Jacobziner observes , is that teenagers are likely to resort to suicide in dealing with seemingly trivial problems . An adult who learns he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and prison may try to kill himself . But a young person may commit suicide because a beloved teacher bawls continued on page 14  | him out , his girl jilts him , his pet dog is hit by a car , or -- if the person involved is a girl ? no one asks her to dance at the school prom . The task of detecting suicidal types among teenagers is also much more difficult than among adults , who nearly always give clear war ling signals of deep depression and social withdrawal . Teenagers may kill themselves apparently on the spur of the moment or after making threats that no one takes seriously . Yet in every case there are deeper , more significant reasons . In Denver , Colorado , a sixteen-yearold girl was sitting in her living room with two boy friends . The boys were arguing good-naturedly about who was going to take her to the school operetta . Each claimed he had n't enough money , and each one refused -- -laughingly ? to lend what money he had to the other . The girl said , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got up and left the room . The boys turned on the TV set . A few minutes later the girl returned to the room and , standing dramatically in front of the lighted - screen , drank a glass of washing ammonia . A psychiatrist who investigated the case reported that the girl had been frequently told by her sophisticated , artistic father that he and her mother had never intended to " get tied down " with a family . He called her , jokingly , " our little mistake . " She was therefore , the report concluded , emotionally allergic @# @# to even the slightest suggestion of re- jection. and the lighthearted argument between her two boy friends catapulted her without warning into an instant , deep depression . There is a very sharp increase in completed suicides in the late teens . Six times as many youngsters aged fifteen to nineteen die by their own hands as those aged ten to fourteen . Below the age of ten , successful suicide is rare , although it does occur . A nine-year-old boy in Spokane , Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you are my love , " and shot himself in the head by pushing the trigger of his father 's hunting rifle with his toe . Cindy was his horse and had been recently sold . In the U.S. , about three times as many boys as girls actually commit suicide ? roughly the same male-female ratio as among adults . But many more girls than boys attempt it . While working as psychiatrist in charge of adolescent services at New York 's Bellevue Hospital , Dr. James M. Toolan reported that , of 106 attempted suicides among children seventeen years old and younger , 85 were girls . Writing in the American Journal of Psychiatry , Dr. Benjamin H. Balser and Dr. James F. Masterson estimate that 90 percent of adolescent suicide attempts are made by girls . Researchers are discovering that suicidal adolescents are pretty ordinaryappearing youngsters . They are likely to be of bright or average intelligence but are not necessarily introverted , friendless bookworms . Although some are suffering from the most common mental illness , schizophrenia ( the inability to distinguish fantasy from reality ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent come from fatherless families . Only about five percent are " rich kids . " Of the successful suicides , only six percent have given plain warning by previous attempts . Authorities have hoped to supple ' a single , solid answer to the anguished question , " Why ? " But no single answer has emerged . Instead , six different patterns of youthful suicide are now ap-parent : SUICIDE BY ACCIDENT OR IGNORANCE Dr Toolan reports that many youngsters really do n't understand that death is final . In Atlanta , eleven-year-old Jane proposed to a group of friends , " Let 's play funeral . " She had recently witnessed her grandmother 's elaborate funeral and had been deeply impressed . She coached a neighbor 's son in the funeral service , then donned her mother 's best dress and scrambled into a large wooden blanket box . " After you 've finished the last hymn , light the candles , lower the lid , and go away and leave me alone , " she directed . They did so . The lid latched and the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pure accident . Yet there 's no doubt that Jane was dramatically preoccupied by the drama of death and saw herself as the central figure . A psychiatrist in Philadelphia said , " Children ? even the older ones -- in our .  | culture are shielded from the realities of death . Often when a parent or grandparent dies they are told that he has merely gone away . If a pet dog has to be destroyed they are told that he has been put to sleep . They never see anyone kill a chicken for dinner . On TV they repeatedly see the actor who was killed on Tuesday playing a leading role on another show on Wednesday . It 's no wonder that some of them have no idea of death 's finality ? and that they think it 's April Fool ! " SUICIDE BECAUSE OF SEVERE SEXUAL ANXIETIES A leading cause of teenage suicide , particularly for boys , is mismanagement of the adolescent sex drive and other insecurities that often go with puberty . The boy who , in the gymnasium shower room , compares his body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developing fast enough , can be thrown into a keen state of anxiety . In Miami a seventeen-year-old boy attempted to have relations for the first time with an older , more sophisticated girl ? and failed . The girl laughed at him cruelly and told his best friends about it . He shot himself . He left a note saying , " If you ca n't be a man , what 's the use of living ? " Exaggerated worries over physical development are also important factors in girls ' attempts to commit suicide . In Cincinnati , a fourteen-year-old girl became hysterical when her mother refused to let her wear a padded brassiere . Following an explosive family quarrel she ran into the bathroom and slashed her wrists . Sex-based love fantasies also sometimes contribute to suicide in young girls . When the death of movie actor James Dean was announced . several dozen teenage girls tried to kill themselves , and two succeeded . SUICIDE AS A CALL FOR HELP Dr. Toolan comments that the SOS is a major factor in many attempted suicides . The teenager feels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything from failure at school to illegitimate pregnancy , unbearable conflict with parents or trouble with authorities . For some reason the normal channels of help from family , teachers , clergymen or physician are closed ? or the youngster is too frightened to seek them out . He or she thereupon attempts suicide in order to reveal his troubles under sympathetic circumstances . Are these suicide attempts consciously phony ? Some are , but not all . And many succeed when they are not intended to . SUICIDE ATTRIBUTED TO MENTAL ILLNESS Dr. Norman L. Faherow and Dr. Edwin S. Schneidman , co-directors of the Los Angeles Suicide Prevention Center , say , " Many youngsters who have mild symptoms of mental illness never recognized or diagnosed suddenly enter an acute stage , resulting in suicide . " A student in his sophomore year at an exclusive Massachusetts preparatory 146 school was an outstanding athlete and a gifted musician . For no reason that anyone could suggest , he quit the track team and stopped practicing his music He told his roommate , " A voice keeps calling me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is ? down at the bottom of the lake . There is someone down there who needs me and wants me . " His roommate said , " I said to hint , ' You sound nuts ! ' I guess I should have , reported it to somebody , but I did n't . Anyway I thought the housemasters surely knew something was wrong . Two clays after Bruce told me Someone down there needs me ' , he drowned himself . " The post-mortem diagnosis was manic-depressive illness ? a type of mental disease which causes victims to experience extremes of happiness and sadness , with suicidal possibilities at either end of the pendulum . Modern drugs are effective in controlling this illness . Bruce  - -  a gifted and kindhearted person ? would almost certainly have been saved through earlier diagnosis . SUICIDE AS A MEANS OF EXPRESSING ANGER Clues to rage and hostility are often found in suicide notes . Some are directly aggressive : " When I 'm dead , you 'll all be sorry . People will talk about how mean you were to me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article , are more subtle but equally hostile . Suicide notes signed " I 'll always love you " and " Love forever " are meant to be reproachful . The victims are filled with deeply repressed rage that they can express in no other way except self-destruction . Usually they have been made to feel unloved and unlovable through grave family conflicts . Sometimes a child unconsciously senses that his mother has never wanted him . Rather than acknowledge that terrible fact , says Dr. Albert Schrut , a psychiatrist on the staff of the Suicide Prevention Center of Los Angeles . in a report on a recent study of suicidal adolescents , the child attempts to arouse her concern by destructive behavior. which ultimately culminates in attempts at suicide . In Atlanta , fourteen-year-old Sharon swallowed half a bottle of her stepfather 's sleeping pills . Only prompt action by the family doctor saved her life . When Sharon 's mother ( who had married four times ) was feeling tranquil . she 'd say to her daughter , " Darling , you 're more important to me than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her husband she blamed the discord on Sharon . She would send her to stay with her grandmother . The morning Sharon tried to kill herself , her mother had made arrangements to send her " home to grandmother " for a visit . SUICIDE BECAUSE OF LOSS OF STATUS This latest phenomenon is found most often on high-pressure high-school and college campuses . Although the number of actual deaths is not very high , the @#  | mounting number of attempts have alarmed authorities . These deaths or near-deaths are rarely the result of depression due to low grades . A Chicago psychiatrist told us , This type of suicide is a young man or woman who has such rigid standards of performance that no personal image lower than perfection can be endured . " Betty , a junior at a top women 's college and a consistently high-ranking student , learned that she had failed by a hair to make the honor society , Phi Beta Kappa . Both her parents and her sister were Phi Beta Kappas . Her humiliation and sense of worthlessness were so extreme that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tablets . These , then , are the six leading causes of youthful suicides . Ignorance . Sex anxieties , A desperate call for help . Mental illness . Repressed anger . Deflated image of one 's self . It 's clear , however , that there are millions of youngsters who pass through these same exhausting , dramatic , highpressure experiences and do n't commit suicide . Thus the most important question to be asked and answered is : What sets off the ones who do ? Most psychiatrists agree two factors are usually present when there is a suicidal response to adolescent pressures . The first and most important is a deep sense of personal uselessness and worthlessness . The second is a deeply shocking experience occurring at adolescence . Such an experience may be the shaming or scolding a girl sometimes receives if she soils her clothing at the onset of menstruation , or the similar treatment often meted out to the young boy who has " wet dreams , " or is discovered masturbating . The sudden death or desertion of a parent may likewise provide a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suicide are investigated by psychiatrically trained persons , and for this reason the cause of a suicide is usually recorded as , for example , " he got a scolding , " or " she flunked history " ? the innocent and apparently meaningless incident that merely served to light the fuse . The story of " Bob , " with which this article began , is an illustration . His maternal grandmother told us , " Bob and his older brother , Warren , were less than a year apart . Fortunately Bob was an angel from the minute he was born . He would play by himself for hours at a time . He was a neat , clean boy . " Bob 's father said , " Until Bob was thirteen you did n't even know he was in the house . Then he grew up almost overnight . He was no longer the easygoing kid brother . He got to be taller than Warren , and he was always asking fool questions , like what we would do if he were kidnaped . " According to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argumentative when he entered ninth grade . He failed one subject and received a warning grade in another . The teacher said remorsefully , " I guess I caused a parental crackdown . Bob was one of my best students . When his grades began falling , I complained to his parents . All I wanted was for them to see that he did his homework . A pretty girl identified as Bob 's former " steady " told us , " I broke up with him because he started standing me up We 'd go to a movie and after about five minutes Bob would just suddenly get up and walk out . He was restless and sort of agitated all the time . He used to talk about shooting himself or joining the marines , but I told him , You 're just bluffing . ' " The family doctor remarked , " Bo seemed to be a model child who ha ; simply got a little bit off base in the past year or so under the pressures of adolescence . I was aware that the parent overvalued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he suddenly turned into an irresponsible adolescent . I got the impression , too . that they had puritanical views about sex . But I did n't realize how serious things were . " @# What was the last straw for Bob ? It may have been the threat , never intended seriously , his father made when he discovered that Bob had been neglecting to feed his dog and that the dog was nearly at the point of starvation . Bob 's father angrily told him he was going to have the dog destroyed because Bob did n't deserve to have a pet . The threat , of course , was never carried out . A careful observer might have noticed a number of alarming warning signals in Bob 's behavior long before he killed himself : a sudden , radical change of personality ; irrational neglect and cruelty toward a dumb animal ; deliberate destruction of a hard-won academic reputation ; breaking social engagements ; restlessness ; threats to kill himself or run away . All these ? occurring separately ? are common aspects of ordinary adolescent stress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spell trouble . Perhaps Bob 's tragedy ? the answer to his mother 's anguished " How can such a thing happen ? " ? is that none of the adults in his life were really paying thoughtful attention to him . His cries for help went unheeded . Parents and teachers should be able to recognize and interpret the warning signals adolescents who are moving toward suicide send out . Young people should know them too ? for often they are the ones best able to help one another . continued  | A potential suicide often asks questions that mean , " Do you love me for myself alone ? " The youngster who asks repeatedly if you really care if he does n't get on the honor roll or whether you would be really thrilled if he made the basketball team is deeply anxious , even if he appears to be joking . He constantly talks about suicide . It 's common to hear people say " People who talk about killing themselves do n't do it . " Research proves this idea is dangerously wrong . A youngster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to kill oneself needs attention and help , even if he denies that it is himself he has in mind . He often talks about someone who is dead . A recently deceased parent , friend or athletic idol occupies much of his conversation . Mementos or pictures of the dead person are exaggeratedly displayed . A normal period of mourning is drawn out to an unusual length of time . He has made a suicide attempt . There are very few suicide attem so " phony " that they should not be t en seriously . Also serious are the conscious attempts at suicide made youngsters who indulge in drag raci reckless skiing , risky swims with training or supervision . Behind th daring is a death wish . If any of these signals are appare parents , teachers , youth leaders a. others who have constant , close contacy with the youngster should not hesitate to seek professional help . There are t sources of advice and aid in most co : - munities . One is the young person 's family doctor . The other is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meanwhile , the concerned adult should keep in close touch with the disturbed youngster . " No kindly neighbor - can cure the presuicidal youngster or even do much about his problems , " DJacobziner says . " But often a bit n ' human warmth at the right moment will pull someone back from the brink an give him the opportunity he needs to recover . " ? @#
