I believe this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal , before this decade is out , of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to earth . No single space project in this period will be more impressive to mankind , or more important for the long-range exploration of space ; and none will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish . In a very real sense , it will not be one man going to the moon-it will be an entire nation . <P> - John F. Kennedy , May 25 , 1961 <P> THIS week , still hopeful that they can achieve the goal set by President Kennedy but aware that time is fast running out , U.S. spacemen will begin their final lunar thrust . Barring last-minute delays , Astronauts Walter Schirra , Walter Cunningham and Donn Eisele will be shot into earth orbit aboard Apollo 7 in the first manned flight of the spacecraft that will eventually carry astronauts to the moon . If Apollo lives up to NASA 's expectations during its eleven-day mission , it will clear the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the landing of astronauts on the lunar surface as early as the spring of next year . <P> There is much to be done , in the short time that is left . But an impressive amount has already been accomplished . Before they are ready to test the performance of their complex craft in space , astronauts put in long months of practice in equally complicated machines at the Manned Spacecraft Center near Houston ( see color pages ) . There , in computer-operated simulators , replicas of spacecraft interiors , they go through complete missions . The simulators move at a touch of the controls , actually vibrate during launch , and present changing views of the earth , moon and stars during their simulated missions . Before they blast off , Astronauts Schirra , Cunningham and Eisele will have spent an impressive 1,200 hours in preparing for their mission . They have had an unexpectedly long time to practice ; this week 's flight , scheduled for February 1967 , was postponed after Astronauts Virgil Grissom , Edward White and Roger Chaffee died in a spacecraft fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10-Sec . Exit . The tragedy jolted NASA out of the complacency that had built up during the highly successful Mercury and Gemini programs , in which a total of 16 manned craft were sent into space , maneuvered and recovered without serious mishap . In a frenzy of self-doubt , NASA virtually tore up the Apollo program , shifted personnel , and clamped down hard on the procedures and workmanship of North American 's Space Division , prime contractors for the Apollo spacecraft . <P> At a cost of $75 million , Apollo itself was redesigned , with thousands of changes in materials , wiring and equipment . In place of the old inward-swinging , three-part hatch that took 90 sec. to open , Apollo 7 has a single outward-swinging hatch that can be opened in 10 sec . To snuff out any fire that might start , there is now an emergency venting system that can reduce cabin pressure in seconds . And while the spacecraft is on the pad , a mixture of 60% oxygen and 40% nitrogen has been substituted for the 100% oxygen of flight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
