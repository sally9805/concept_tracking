<P> In Dublin last week the Borden Co. announced that it has chosen a site in County Cork in the heart of Ireland 's dairy country to build the biggest dry-milk plant it has ever constructed outside the U.S. The new plant , scheduled for completion next May , will cost $2,240,000 , employ 50 , and produce about 9,000,000 lbs . of dry whole-milk powder a year , chiefly for export to South America . <P> The plant is the newest example of the Irish government 's successful campaign to lure in foreign industries to bolster the island 's faltering economy . Principally agricultural , Ireland has provided so few jobs that each year as many as 40,000 Irishmen immigrate , mainly to the U.S. and Canada , to find work . Two years ago , the government put together an appealing package . To the foreign industrialist , it grants a ten-year tax exemption on export profits and offers to pay the full cost of training the workers ( average wage : $29 for a 44-hr , week ) , plus 50% of the cost of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building a plant . In addition , it will pay the full cost of building plants in the underdeveloped western counties . To companies locating plants in the customs-free port in Shannon , it gives a tax holiday on export profits until 1983 . <P> Under the incentive program , 51 new factories turning out products ranging from transistor radios to giant shipyard cranes have been built for foreign firms in Ireland . For their share , foreign firms have invested about $84 million in plants and machinery . The plants have directly created 10,000 new jobs , indirectly another 10,000 . Nearly one-quarter of the plants belong to West German firms , which , faced with a labor shortage at home , have turned to Ireland for a bountiful supply of workers . Besides Borden , twelve other U.S. firms , including Brunswick Corp. , Standard Pressed Steel ( electronic components ) and Hallmark , have set up plants in Ireland . Nearly all the products from Irish plants are admitted duty-free to Great Britain , receive preferential treatment from Commonwealth nations . <P> The new industry has given Ireland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the gross national product is now growing at an annual rate of 3.5% . Exports , which amounted to only $310 million in 1955 , are expected to pass the $450 million mark this year . The increase in industrial exports has narrowed Ireland 's trade gap from $271 million in 1955 to an anticipated $224 million for 1960 . As the pace of industrialization quickens , the Irish hope to close the trade gap entirely .
