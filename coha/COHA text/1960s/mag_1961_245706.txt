There was no Crisis Book to read on the U.S. economy , no reason for an ex-Senator from Massachusetts to find any surprises . " We must show the world what a free economy can do-to reduce unemployment , to put unused capacity to work , to spur new productivity , and to foster higher economic growth within a range of sound fiscal policies and relative price stability , " he said in his State of the Union message . But when Kennedy got around to specific proposals in his special economic message three days later , it was pretty evident that he was limited by the same facts of economic life as the Eisenhower Administration , and his recommended deeds had a long way to go to catch up with his activist words . <P> Old Tools . His message eschewed the massive pump-priming plans and public-works projects dear to some economists , stressed instead the expansion of existing programs . He urged Congress to boost minimum social security benefits ( from $33 a month to $43 ) , lift the minimum wage ( from $1 an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ) , stretch out unemployment compensation payments , and pass a depressed-areas bill . Said House Republican Minority Leader Charles Halleck of those proposals : " We find no great quarrel with them , but we do not find them earthshaking . " <P> Kennedy promised to do some more by executive action . He would put through a depressed-areas food-stamp plan , cut FHA mortgage rates ( from 5% to 5% to bolster the housing market , pay out 1961 veterans ' insurance dividends ahead of schedule , and speed up the letting of Government contracts . Cost of the package : something less than $5 billion-not much more than the $4 billion rise in cash outlays that Dwight Eisenhower had projected for fiscal 1962 . <P> One reason that President Kennedy could not do more was that President Eisenhower had already done much . The Eisenhower Administration had extended unemployment coverage , broadened social security benefits and taxes and speeded up federal procurement . Indeed Ike had arranged things so that new Government contracts will leap by $10.7 billion this fiscal year , to $86 billion . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and aid the recession 's hardest-hit victims , Kennedy also unfurled some long-span programs that cheered businessmen . He urged cheaper long-term loans to spur capital investment ; at the same time he hoped to firm short-term interest rates to stem the flow of gold to countries where rates are more attractive . The two goals are " contradictory , " Kennedy admitted , and achieving them would require all the wizardry of Republican Treasury Secretary Douglas Dillon and Democratic Federal Reserve Chairman William McChesney Martin Jr . Kennedy went on to speak of a long-overdue tax reform to come , hinting that the Administration would strive to liberalize depreciation rates and to plug tax loopholes.
