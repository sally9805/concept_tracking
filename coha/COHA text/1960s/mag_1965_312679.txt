The great march was over , the last hallelujah had sounded from the speaker 's stand , the crowd of some 25,000 had left the streets outside the starkwhite capital in Montgomery , and a period of relative peace seemed about to descend on Alabama 's strife-torn civil rights scene . Then the white racists of Alabama , in characteristic fashion , shattered that peace by murdering a white woman from Detroit . This act of moronic savagery once again outraged the national conscience , provoked the President of the U.S. into a nationwide television outburst , in which he announced the arrest of four Ku Klux Klansmen and demanded that Congress curb the Klan . <P> Gibes &; Guards . The four-day , 54-mile march from Selma to Montgomery had itself been an experience , not an excitement . It started on the after noon of Sunday , March 21 , with some 3,400 marchers led by two Nobel Peace prizewinners-the Rev. Martin Luther King and Ralph Bunche , now U.N . Under Secretary for Special Political Affairs . In the procession , whites and Negroes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by side . There was a blind man from Atlanta on the arm of his 64-year-old mother . There was a one-legged man from Michigan swinging along on crutches ( from the sidelines , white hecklers kept calling out in parade cadence : " Left , left , left " ) . There was a nun from Kansas City who trudged grimly along while rednecks hooted gibes about her vows of chastity . <P> The marchers had plenty of protection-from some 1,000 military police sent by President Johnson , from 1,900 federalized Alabama National Guards men , from platoons of U.S. marshals and FBI men . Miles ahead of the marchers , demolition experts searched each bridge , each underpass . Rifle-bearing troops were stationed at every crossroad along the route . Long before the demonstrators arrived at their overnight bivouacs , a thin line of soldiers swept cautiously across each field to check for mines , bombs or booby traps . <P> There were , of course , some silly attempts at harassment . Bitter Alabamians drove past in cars , yelping obscenities at the marchers . One day a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the jobs of Negroes in the march ( " An unemployed agitator ceases to agitate " ) . The 141-member Alabama legislature unanimously passed a resolution claiming that there had been " evidence of much fornication " at the marchers ' camps and that " young women are returning to their respective states apparently as unwed expectant mothers . " Retorted John Lewis , chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee : " All these segregationists can think of is fornication , and that is why there are so many different shades of Negroes . " <P> The Big Show . Martin Luther King himself left in mid-march to make a speech in Cleveland , returned to the procession a few miles outside Montgomery . He walked about 27 miles in all . That night , a batch of high-priced and highly diversified entertainers-such as Sammy Davis Jr. , Nipsey Russell , Shelley Winters , Floyd Patterson , Harry Belafonte , Leonard Bernstein-performed for thousands packed in a muddy field in Montgomery .                  @ @ @
