Darkened stage . Glow of red coals in the background . ASSAWAMSET , the chief of the Narraganset , a large kingly man , stands facing THOMAS MORTON , the Master of Merry Mount . In the shadows , dimly seen figures of Englishmen and Indians . ASSAWAMSET Death has brought me back to you . THOMAS MORTON Death ? ASSAWAMSET Seven days I fasted , and on the eighth a voice said , " Go forward , turn no more than the geese flying south . " Carrying only my bow and a roll of furs , I marched south , turning no more than the geese . Seven days , seven nights , and on the eighth as I sat cooking my evening meal on a meadow by a brook 's edge , I saw three clearings in the forest , three well-beaten paths . They shone and whistled like burning arrows . THOMAS MORTON What then ? Could you walk on those paths ? ASSAWAMSET No , I entered the first path . The forest was on fire . I entered the second path . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried the third . This too was fire , but false fire I felt nothing , and journeyed straight forward another day , and came to a mountain , steep rock , and white as ermine . And there on the top you sat . THOMAS MORTON I could n't have been there , I have been expecting you here , many days . You are slow . p. 3 ASSAWAMSET No , you were sitting on top of the mountain , and loudly laughing at me . Your skin and robe were as white as bleached bones . I saw you were the servant of the Master of life , but I did n't know how to reach you , for there was no foothold in the rock . Then you said , " Take off your clothes , Assawamset , and bathe in the brook . Then break your bow , and throw me all your furs . " I obeyed . When I had bathed and broken my bow , and given you my furs , you threw me a gun . " Fire into the rock , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw I had blasted a stairway in the rock , and when I climbed to where you sat , the mountain had changed to a great plain , and you were gone . And then a voice was saying , " I am the maker and unmaker of earth and sky , the trees , the brooks , the mountains , fish , bird , beast and man , their breath that comes , their breath that goes . Because I love you , I have sent Thomas Morton to you , and he has given you his gun . Trust this man , and trust his guns ; they will lift you from your dust and bring you back . But beware of all other white men ; most of all , the dogs dressed in gray cloth and iron , these men of God will steal your hunting grounds and kill your game . When you fire your gun at them , their fallen bodies will be like a stairway of white rock for you to walk on . THOMAS MORTON Bring out the barter .

ASSAWAMSET Lifts his hand and a young INDIAN GIRL comes to him@@ In the 1630 's , Merry Mount , the settlement of Thomas Morton near Wollaston , Massachusetts . To one side , a Maypole covered with fresh birch branches and tied with ribbons of twenty different colors . In the background , a little to one side , the front of a brown seventeenth-century house with diamond windows . A small group of REVELLERS is trying on animal heads : wolves , stags , etc . In the middle ground , a fine young man with a rainbow scarf ; with him , a beautiful woman in a rainbow-colored dress . They are EDWARD and EDITH , just married and chosen King and Queen of the May , for it is the First of May . A MAN comes out and sloppily attaches a flag , the Red Cross of England , above the doorway . In the foreground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the head of the settlement , and MR . BLACKSTONE , an Episcopal minister , just arrived from England . MORTON wears a shabby coffee-colored suit , part cloth and part deerskin . He is overweight and his manner with the minister is complacent , oily and conciliatory . MR . BLACKSTONE is dressed in a finely fitting black minister 's habit . He has long set cavalier hair and talks with the crisp briskness of a high official addressing an inferior . MR . BLACKSTONE I do n't know why I am here at Merry Mount . These hills do n't look like hills ; they are too blue ; the ocean is even bluer , there are three thousand miles of it between me and home , between here and Oxford and my King . I wonder why he picked me for this mission . p. 6 THOMAS MORTON We are strange co-conspirators , your Reverence . MR . BLACKSTONE I do n't understand you , Mr. Morton .

I 'm used to prepared ground . Back in England , the fields are already golden for the harvest . I was trained to put the final polish on a parish that was already shining . THOMAS MORTON This is the new England , this is God 's land . That 's why it 's so rough ; even the Puritans ca n't change that . If you stay here in Merry Mount , and open your eyes , you 'll love it . Look at me , I know its animals , its birds , and every inch and inlet of this coast , as far south as Plymouth and as far north as Salem . MR .

Come down to earth with us , sir ! I felt as you do when I first came here : no noblemen , cathedrals or plays . But you 'll get used to us . I need you officially . I want you to crown Edward and Edith King and Queen of the May . MR . BLACKSTONE I have just married them , that 's as far as my office goes . I have serious work to do , Mr. Morton ! MAN WITH STAG 'S HEAD In a high comical voiceWe need the priest of God to give us our true king and queen . REVELLERS Give us a king and queen . THOMAS MORTON You see how much we want you .

Hurrah for the King and Queen of England ! MR . BLACKSTONE Now that the coronation is over , I hope you will excuse me . I have reports to write for the Crown .

You 'll smooth them . MR . BLACKSTONE You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here by his Lordship of Canterbury to smooth up your animated doggerel . We can use the Indians to tame the Puritans , but there must be some decency , some boundary between the King 's savage and his more civilized subjects . Our bishops are busy working out a suitable formula to express the King 's wishes in this matter . All this shaggy clowning and disorder must stop , sir , or our royal patronage will be withdrawn . THOMAS MORTON Right you are , your Reverence . This is easily fixed . In a loud voiceChildren , I want you to dance like ladies and gentlemen . Dismiss your Indian companions . Remember you represent the King on this frontier . Dance for England . MORTON sings , this time very correctly , as the INDIAN GIRLS steal off and the other REVELLERS dance a stately and sedate danceFair and fair , and twice so fair , as fair as any may be , the fairest shepherd on our green , a love for any lady .

EDITH leads the dance p. 10 THOMAS MORTON England 's our old love , your Reverence . We know England will always be our old love , do n't we ? MR . BLACKSTONE A very pretty dance , Mr. Morton ! It reminds me of our masques at Oxford . I do n't like your ribaldry . You are very changeable and double-faced here . You should follow King Charles , even his pleasures are gracious . THOMAS MORTON The world is changeable . It 's like a playing card : a king in all his theatrical pomp in front  --  and what 's on the other side ? Black and white squares . I am talking about battalions of soldiers . You 've got to throw those dogs a little flesh if you want them to fight the Puritans . MR . BLACKSTONE Dogs , a playing card and black and white squares ! What are you saying ? Our kingdom is a pyramid . Charles Stuart stands at the top . Below him , his subjects descend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's in grace and proportion . If you do n't understand the principles of our pyramid , you 'll only be an obstruction to us . THOMAS MORTON Authority is growing on you . I have been noticing a certain distaste and disrespect in your voice , Mr. Blackstone . You speak to me like a slave driver of Pharaoh . This hurts me . I ca n't grow wheat on a pyramid . I am running a plantation . It 's very lonely here . The King does n't have friends here . p. 11 MR . BLACKSTONE Your plantation will take care of itself , when we 've finished our pyramid . THOMAS MORTON That 's your theory . I have mine for this country . Lords and college men are needed in England . I 'm needed here . The King needs a man with very diverse talents here in America . My men are green . I have to direct every step or they would die . My men are n't angels . I have to keep them happy ! Tell your Archbishop to send us no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to make it pay . I have to live , and walk on a razor 's edge between the Indians and Governor Endecott 's Puritan settlement in Salem . MR . BLACKSTONE Our King understands your talents , Mr. Morton . When you return to England , you will be paid . Here we value your loyalty , but not your advice . Soon your troubles will be over . I have been given powers to revoke the charter for this colony . The King is sending the Puritans a royal governor . THOMAS MORTON The Puritans wo n't like the idea of a royal governor . MR . BLACKSTONE Poor things ! Our force will fall on them like a thunderbolt ! THOMAS MORTON I 'm sure it will . I suppose there will be a bishop . MR . BLACKSTONE Of course , there 'll be a bishop . I see what you are hinting at  --  God preserve me from such a promotion ! p. 12 THOMAS MORTON Oh no , you 'll be useful . You have the right presence . You will fall on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I suppose the King will be sending an even more useful standing army over , a regiment or two to keep the Puritans in a good humor ? MR . BLACKSTONE That wo n't be necessary . No one disputes with a king . Of course he has regiments to spare . THOMAS MORTON None to spare on America , I guess ; the King needs that sort of talent in England . I hear there 's been Presbyterian trouble in Scotland . MR . BLACKSTONE All smoke and no fire . You know how those dissenters like to preach . THOMAS MORTON I never knew a man so short of cash as King Charles . The Presbyterians do n't think he 's earned his taxes . MR . BLACKSTONE That will be over in a year or two . I doubt if anyone will care to be a Presbyterian when we have thoroughly installed our Church . Every creature in the land will have his place on our pyramid , each will be free to obey his proper superior . Money will pour in like water . Then our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . THOMAS MORTON That will be the end of the world ! A king , archbishops , bishops , governor generals , governors , clerks , offices , titles and penalties the wheels wo n't turn . There 's no money  --  Or is the Lord of Hosts your servant ? p. 13 MR . BLACKSTONE You are speaking like a dissenter . THOMAS MORTON No , you misunderstand me . I reverence your Archbishop . God knows , I need all the authority he can give me here at Merry Mount . Do you see this book ? Bishop Laud sent it to me . It 's the Book of Common Prayer . It 's my Bible . Night and day , I drum it into the heads of these animals . I mean my children . I call these people my children . I am their father . I love this book . I 've even tried to convert the Puritans to its harmonious English . That 's why they hate me , that 's why they manhandle me . They 've made a hog sty of my plantation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on you besides your love of the Book of Common Prayer . THOMAS MORTON Well , they do n't care for our May Days . Oh , I know that May Day probably needs a proper ritual . Your prayer book will soon include that , but there 's no harm in May Day . It 's traditional , it must come down to us from the Goths . It 's one of those things that makes England England and survives a hundred civil wars and rulers . You ca n't expect my men to change all that . I think this might be the time for you to bless us , and marry us to the Indians . My men have been standing on tiptoe for months , waiting for you and this day . All they need are a few wives to keep them from fornication . p. 14 MR . BLACKSTONE Your May Day and a few other things will have to be toned down a bit . I can see why the Puritans wished to discipline you . You are not suggesting that they will defy the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Wiping his foreheadThere are flies here . THOMAS MORTON May-flies , May-flies . I am here , the King is beyond the sea . You think I am the only fly in the King 's butter . Well , I probably am , but these kings , they come and go with us . I ca n't keep track of them . This one will go like the rest , but England remains . MR . BLACKSTONE Would our nation still be England , if a Puritan were King ? A man like your Governor Endecott . I am talking foolishness , but such revolutions have happened on the Continent . John Calvin and John Knox  --  those criminal John the Baptists  --  do they think our Christian Prince is King Herod ? THOMAS MORTON Of course they think Charles is Herod , or Nebuchadnezzar or something of the kind , but England will survive that little fever of faith . We 'll have men singing psalms through their noses , and marching and countermarching through the realm in iron . Then their dust will blow off . We 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  there 'll be license for the subject and power for the statesmen . Our supply of both is endless . p. 15 MR . BLACKSTONE Well , I 'm not losing sleep over the Puritans . In a year or two , our new order will be the law of the land . King and bishop , truth and power , one seamless robe . Do you think Governor Endecott will defy me ? THOMAS MORTON I do n't know . He might give you a kick in the ribs . I know this , though : Endecott is an Englishman , he carried our flag , the Red Cross of England , against the Spaniard . He 'll never defy England . He 's as loyal there as I am . MR . BLACKSTONE Not much to rely on , you are both double-faced , though , of course , I know you 've only been playing with trivial things such as theft and fornication , while Endecott is mixed up with blasphemy and treason . I hear he was once a courtier and man of letters , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MORTON Yes , he 's their brass bull snorting fire . When you 've been here longer , you 'll learn there are Puritans and Puritans ; Endecott is n't like any of them . I do n't understand how he can listen by the day to his bone-headed , turtle-brained preachers . He never talks much . He acts , and all he does goes against us . What soured and ruined him , I guess , was the dishonesty of holding office . No , these Puritans will never revolt from England . That would be walking blindfold off a plank into the Atlantic . They 're nothing without England . p. 16 MR . BLACKSTONE We 'll grind their necks down ! A REVELLER comes up to MORTON and places a falcon on his wristThat 's a fine bird you have . THOMAS MORTON I call him Hassi . Assawamset , the chief of the Narraganset , gave him to me . MR . BLACKSTONE You have fearful allies , Mr. Morton . I prefer the hawk to the savage . THOMAS MORTON Yes , he 's like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew up with . They knew all about hawks . But you underestimate Assawamset , he 's in love with King Charles . The only Englishman worth his admiration  --  so he thinks . King Charles ought to knight him or crown him . That would be a shrewd blow against the Puritans . Assawamset is a true aristocrat , much like this hawk . They 're both practiced in graceful round-about ways of killing . PauseI was given this bird a fortnight after I landed here . By Christmas , I had him eating out of my hand . Gentleness and impudence , that 's how I rule man or beast . A gunshot is heard off-stage MR . BLACKSTONE What 's that ? I do n't like the sound of guns . THOMAS MORTON One of our local Indians . They 're rather a headache . When an Indian gets something to drink , he blasts away at anything in sight . We have to give them liquor and guns to get their furs . They 're sick of beads and shells . p. 17 MR . BLACKSTONE They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't you set up targets for them on some deserted beach . I do n't like explosions . THOMAS MORTON Right again , your Reverence . I see now how much we 've always needed a Church of England man to come to Merry Mount and teach us how to bury our garbage . Imagine thinking of giving the Indians targets in this game-overrun country ! MR . BLACKSTONE CrisplyDo n't snap at me , Mr. Morton . My theology teaches me to deal sensibly with what 's at hand . We know you are at hand . We can use you , you wo n't regret being used by us , so henceforth spare me your jokes , and excuse me . I have important reports to make . MR . BLACKSTONE walks stiffly into the house THOMAS MORTON A university man . A little off the ground . We can use him here . He 'll claw up the Puritans . MORTON sits stroking his hawk . Two PURITAN SOLDIERS enter , a PRIVATE and a SERGEANT . They are tremendously armed : match-locks , gray uniforms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gaping at me in iron ? You look like Spaniards . I 've put your kind to flight in the Low Countries . You 'd better move on . I 'm not keeping open house . p. 18 SERGEANT I 'm not surprised you no longer know your countrymen . We come from Governor Endecott . We 're his vanguard . Who are you , sir ? THOMAS MORTON You come from Somerset or Bristol , do n't you , Sergeant ? The game 's not as plentiful there as here . SERGEANT Where I come from means nothing in the world . What 's your name ? THOMAS MORTON I am Thomas Morton , the host of Merry Mount . I am the big sachem here . The Narraganset have just made me a chief . SERGEANT We knew you were Morton . I just wanted your own confession . I know too why the Indians make a white man their chief . You have been selling them guns SOLDIER We 're here to burn your settlement down . THOMAS MORTON I admire your stubborn desperation . Miles Standish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . I 've cleared things in England . If you harm me , you will be punished for treason . SERGEANT His Excellency , John Endecott , Governor of Salem , is on the march here . He has more soldiers than you can count . You wo n't be able to find your settlement when he leaves you . THOMAS MORTON You roar like full-grown bears now . I remember you when you needed my help . You whined like bears ' whelps then . I know you Puritans . Your whiskey is plunder and profit . Your holy thirst for my mink and beaver skins is driving you mad . p. 19 SERGEANT You 've been giving the Indians guns for their furs . They 've been killing our women and children . THOMAS MORTON They were probably using your own guns . Your hands are n't clean . Do n't tell me you got the Indians ' furs from them by singing psalms ! SERGEANT Look at us , we are going to treat you the way Standish treated you . He shipped you back to England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sergeant , I am beginning to take to you . You Bristol boys know how to handle the language . Ape 's a fine old English word . I 've got another one for Standish ! Shrimp . You think he was a giant because you never saw him . We called him Captain Shrimp . He was about four and a half feet tall . Do you know what he did ? He was in the Dutch militia . He was such a runt they made him a drummer . When he came here , I gave him such a welcome he wished his drum were big enough to hide under . He wished his drum was Diogenes ' tub . SERGEANT Who is this Diogenes ? THOMAS MORTON He was a droning , drearily dressed fellow , like you or Standish , only he had brains and talked Greek . Standish caught me by creeping up on me by stealth . Eight men to one ! They were so happy at bagging me , they called me the great dragon of the Apocalypse . They all got drunk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you know what a Trojan horse is ? p. 20 SERGEANT We go on foot here . How should I know about fancy Spanish horses ? THOMAS MORTON Let me tell you something : if you ever see a Trojan horse , do n't give him the keys to Boston or Salem . He 'll eat your hearts out . Do you want to know how I tripped up Standish ? While the Puritans were drinking themselves blind , I pretended I was sick . I did n't eat or drink a thing . I wanted to stay awake . I was as watchful as the geese that guarded the Roman Capitol . You would n't know about those geese , Sergeant , you 're city-bred and a Puritan . Anyway , I was watchful . In the dead of night , I cut loose from the stupid armed tinker they 'd tied in bed with me like a bride to hold me down . I broke through two double-locked doors . " What shall we do ? Oh , what shall we do ? He 's gone , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how they gabbled . They ran together like rams at full butt in the dark . Standish was so angry he broke his breastplate , but I was out and free and in my own country . I knew every inch of it ! SERGEANT I 've heard they caught up with you next morning and shipped you like a chained ape to England . THOMAS MORTON You have apes on the brain , Sergeant ! I let them capture me because I wanted to save their poor and worthy blood . They came at me like a flock of geese , or horses tailed together at a fair : I could have knocked them down like ninepins , but I wanted to save their English blood . I had two men , one was dead drunk , the other was a coward . That sort of thing wo n't happen here now ; we have the King and Church behind us . We have claws ! p. 21 SERGEANT We are waiting for Governor Endecott . He is a moderate man , perhaps he 'll enjoy your stories . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can count . I think he 'll order them to burn your settlement to the ground . THOMAS MORTON Yes , I fear his patience and moderation more than your dull ferocity . Come to your senses , Sergeant . We 're all Englishmen . There 're few enough of us in the world . There 's no need for us to run berserk and kill one another . SERGEANT What 's so English about you ? THOMAS MORTON My flag . Do you see it flying over my door ? I hope you 'll enjoy the sight and breathe the clean air here . I 'm sorry I ca n't invite you into my house . If you wait here , you may get some new ideas . You may want to count up your soldiers , and march back to Salem . MORTON goes into house SERGEANT Morton has missed his calling . He should have been a preacher , then we would have had to listen . SOLDIER Yes , sir , but let me warn you . You are talking too much about the numbers of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had eyes to see , we would see the heavenly chariots and battalions hovering about us . Here in America , we are in Israel , where the breath of faith blew down the walls of Satan . p. 22 SERGEANT Chariots ? How long do you think they 'd stand up to our gunfire ? We 've got something better than a heavenly host . We have Endecott . He 's lucky to have a man with my war experience and black tongue to beat some shape into you dreamers and meeting-house orators . SOLDIER The battlefield is only the great meeting house . Have you noticed the Governor lately ? SERGEANT Of course . SOLDIER Have you noticed how he keeps whining to himself , and complaining about his armor ? First it 's too light , then it 's too heavy . Then he keeps jumping from subject to subject . I ca n't follow a man unless he stays on one subject . SERGEANT You should go on dreaming about the heavenly host , and leave the Governor alone . He 'll do our thinking for us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you think he 'll burn this settlement ? SERGEANT No . SOLDIER I think the Governor is turning away from God . No one gets killed any more . I tell you , a man must live by faith in this colony . SERGEANT Do n't worry about the Governor 's faith . He 's a man much like me , only educated . These things are over your head , soldier ; running a colony takes a lot of juggling . He still keeps a loaded pistol in his right hand and a Bible in his left . We 've just killed the chief of the Narraganset , Assawamset . What more do you want ? p. 23 SOLDIER Remember how the Lord turned away from Saul for sparing the Amalekites . What are we doing here ? SERGEANT This is a war . More shots are heard off-stage . The REVELLERS , terrified and with torn clothes , are herded in by the PURITAN SOLDIERS . One of the SOLDIERS is an Indian , half in war paint , half in armor . GOVERNOR ENDECOTT comes last . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grizzled beard that covers the upper part of his burnished breastplate .

There 's not much here for you , just a mob of vicious men and women women and men dressed up as women . Putting them down will be child 's play for you , but I want you to show that we are humble , show that we are obedient , show that we are mighty . We have borne the Red Cross of England to Merry Mount . SERGEANT Pointing to flag over doorwayHere 's another flag just like it , your Excellency . GOVERNOR JOHN ENDECOTT There are flags and flags .

I put on this wolf 's head to amuse my children . I was laying the wolf in the fables . I have never touched flesh . GOVERNOR JOHN ENDECOTT This is no wolf ! If he had fangs , I 'd drive a spike through his tongue and brain , and hang him under that flag , let his blood spill down the steps . This fellow is an old ewe sheep pretending he 's a wolf . We 'll stick him in the pillory . He can howl and grin there till sunset . A pillory is brought out . The MAN is put in it SERGEANT Here 's a fellow gotten up as a stag , sir .

I am a Christmas reindeer . GOVERNOR JOHN ENDECOTT Put halters on his neck and break him in like a mule . He is used to bringing cheer , let him drag my gun carriage . Halters are put on the STAG MAN . He drags a cannon across the stage . MR . PALFREY , a young Puritan Minister , enters , brisk and out of breath . He wears a black cloak , a high-crowned hat , his shoes are bemiredWelcome back to us , Mr. Palfrey ; I thought you had deserted me for Governor Winthrop of Boston . p. 25 PALFREY I come from burying my father-in-law , Judge Bowden . I am here to avenge him . I bring you the prayers of the widow and orphans . When I heard about your march against the Indians , the spirit of the Lord descended on me , my feet hardly touched the ground , my shoes had wings . The murderers must die ! GOVERNOR JOHN ENDECOTT The Judge was a somber and noble gentleman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps . I never thought one could kill him . PALFREY Age unhinges the bravest and subtlest of minds . Judge Bowden came to believe that he had at last broken the Indians . He vainly sent his unarmed sons out to plant pumpkins . He was sitting in the sunlight of his doorway , with his gun cradled between his knees , and reading from his favorite book of the Bible , the conquest of Canaan . He was much troubled that the Lord would strike him for being too fierce with the Indians , or too gentle . He thought he was safe . The land was cleared for a hundred yards before his door . No arrow could reach him . GOVERNOR JOHN ENDECOTT He was changing to a man of peace . He was no fool , though . PALFREY How could he know that Morton had strengthened the savages with guns ? One of them fired from behind a tree , creased his skull , and stunned him . Then the cowardly skunks rushed in , stinking and howling . They pushed the Judge into an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own sword , and sliced him across the breast and the belly . With each stroke , they screamed , " Judge Bowden , Judge Bowden , I cross of my account ! " They cut off his nose and ears , and shoved them in his mouth . They made him chew , then they let him fall on his sword . His wife saw it all . The Indians were too drunk on Morton 's rum to find where she was hiding . The Indians have tortured and killed the just man , now thousands will die for the mercy of God . I am here to help you on this angry day . p. 26 GOVERNOR JOHN ENDECOTT You are late , Mr. Palfrey , I fear you are too late . We decided in our wisdom that Assawamset , the chief of the Narraganset , was the murderer of your father-in-law . We had to name someone . We had to name the man we wanted . I weep for Judge Bowden . By his death , God rest his soul , he gave us a chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Assawamset is dead . I had to have him killed . Now no Indian will stir for twenty years . Now our necessary massacre is over . You 're not needed here . We missed you on the day of deliverance in Salem . Your thirst would have been satisfied . PALFREY I was burying my father-in-law and mourning for him . GOVERNOR JOHN ENDECOTT No , you should have been at Salem and rejoicing . It was a great day . Many said it was the best they 'd seen since we came to New England . Hundreds of Indians were kneeling before us on the town green . Many wished to be baptized . Most of these we spared . Then Mr. Peters began with a brief prayer , then Mr. Marshall prayed for a large two hours , confessing our sins in a most tragic and prudent way , then Mr. Arrowsmith preached for an hour , then we sang a psalm by Mr. Wigglesworth , then Mr. Palmer preached for an hour , then Mr. Wilson prayed for two hours , then we sang Mr. Wigglesworth 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was a glorious day . Before it ended , I felt I was walking in my sleep through the darkness of our salvation . I was carrying too much armor . My bones were like chains . p. 27 PALFREY I am here to raise your heart . GOVERNOR JOHN ENDECOTT It needs no raising . My work is done . You should never have abandoned Governor Winthrop . PALFREY Mr. Winthrop is a strict man , your Excellency , a deliberating man , but after I 'd ministered to him , I wished to be at your side and in the line of battle . There is no man like you . When you march , you set the earth on fire . GOVERNOR JOHN ENDECOTT I suppose I can use your angry voice , but there 'll be no fire . This is routine police work . You need something stronger to sink your teeth into , but I 've nothing to give you . PALFREY You are still Endecott . You 'll never shrink into a lawyer and philosopher like Winthrop . GOVERNOR JOHN ENDECOTT Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Too much administration makes a man thoughtful and hesitant . After this last expedition , I felt the food inside me was thickening to mud . I go to sleep on duty . My armor is too heavy . My bones are burning . PALFREY You are a sleeping lion , sir . You must destroy Merry Mount . Then you can administer in peace and be wise as Solomon . SERGEANT Here 's a young man gotten up as a witch , your Excellency . What shall we do with him ? p. 28 MAN DRESSED AS A WITCH In an old woman 's falsettoI am anointed with the juice of smallage , cinquefoil , wolf-bane , and the fat of a newborn babe . I 'm out to catch young men going to communion . PALFREY I know this babbler , your Excellency . He is as blasphemous here as in Boston . Jam a cleft stick on his tongue , and let him gag till his tongue drops off . GOVERNOR JOHN ENDECOTT Oh , angry voice ! God has spoken , Sergeant . Fasten a twig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunset . A stick is put in the YOUNG MAN 's mouth SERGEANT Here 's an Indian girl , your Excellency . We caught her dancing with the English people . She does n't know a word of English . GOVERNOR JOHN ENDECOTT God be praised , I wo n't have to speak to her or hear her . I feared she was a white woman dressed as a heathen . PALFREY She may know no English , but Englishmen know her well enough . She is a whore . Heat up a poker , Sergeant , then burn a red A on her red cheeks ! This is n't the court of the Archbishop who blesses such abominations ! GOVERNOR JOHN ENDECOTT God has spoken again , Sergeant . Bring out an apron with an A sewn on it , and let it dangle from the girl 's neck . An apron is put on the GIRL 's neck . An arrow from off-stage falls at ENDECOTT 's feet . He breaks it contemptuously , and kicks it away with his armored footThis is like David coming out against Goliath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have collected their guns , now their toy arrows pop off our steel caps and breastplates like shuttlecocks . I feel ridiculous , standing here enclosed in iron . p. 29 PALFREY They may seem like toys to you , sir , but these arrows have killed our English men and women , they have even caught full-grown men off guard . Look ahead of us , your Excellency , look onward . We face three thousand miles of wilderness ; each mile is held by a savage tribe  --  enough solid land to fill up the sea from here to England . We must liberate our land from strangers , even if each mile is a marsh of bodies . GOVERNOR JOHN ENDECOTT Oh , there 's little hope of that , sir . None of these Indians will make a stand against us . Now that their chief is gone , they hardly give us a day of real soldiering in a year 's marching . Here , Sergeant , take four men and round up the Indians Morton 's camp followers ! The SOLDIERS march off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The lights begin to darkenI still feel I am walking in my sleep through the darkness . If I could crawl out of my armor I might be alive then . PALFREY I am a much older and weaker man than you are , your Excellency . But nothing holds me back when the Lord 's work is waiting . On a day like this , you must n't crawl on your belly , you must stand , you must stamp on this wasp 's nest . Then you can rest . Why do you water down my punishments ? GOVERNOR JOHN ENDECOTT Have you ever seen a hollow suit of armor walking , or trying to walk ? p. 30 PALFREY I 've never seen such things , nor hope to ; only the Catholics and the heathen see visions . Why do you wander so and avoid my questions ? You are un-Christian , sir , to soften my punishments . GOVERNOR JOHN ENDECOTT Look , I am the hollowness inside my armor . PALFREY Please , come back to us , sir ! GOVERNOR JOHN ENDECOTT I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much about my dead wife . She used to enjoy dancers like these in England . PALFREY God gives , and God takes . GOVERNOR JOHN ENDECOTT I have read something of the sort , but never so tersely expressed . Come ! We are old comrades . I want to speak to you honestly . I have been having the fevers . In my fever , I seem to be pacing in chains through a strange land . I keep thinking they will rust away , or my flesh PALFREY It 's dangerous to peer into our own minds , your Excellency . When I am bewildered , I make my mind a blank and read the Bible . Then the Lord fills my emptiness with wisdom . GOVERNOR JOHN ENDECOTT I know , I know . I am an old admirer of your sermons . But , you see , in my fever I kept asking myself questions and questions , things no man in authority has ever answered . When my wife died , I served in the army . Somehow , I found I could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iron faith . p. 31 PALFREY The iron of the Lord is more precious than gold . GOVERNOR JOHN ENDECOTT I got little gold then I came here . Listen closely to me . I am making a confession , and at the same time giving you a little lesson in statecraft . When I came here , I found my training had only prepared me to be the colony sheriff . My job was peacetime police work , not the sort of thing a soldier could take much pride in . At first , my administration was rough and quick . I did things no Englishman would suffer , but no more than a frontier colony demands . PALFREY I have honored you above all our officers and preachers . Now you need prodding . GOVERNOR JOHN ENDECOTT No , I needed thoughts , but none of you could help . When I was working and struggling with the government of King Charles , I found that each action I wished to take had to be reconsidered in the light of a report to England . Costly , influential royal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decisions had to be such as could be described not only in my letters but in my enemies ' letters as pleasing the King . Pleasing the King ! By my soul , I never proposed or believed in submission . I have learned to procrastinate and wait on Providence . PALFREY You make problems where there are none . Say what you believe , believe what you say . Statecraft is quite over my head . p. 32 GOVERNOR JOHN ENDECOTT Yes , it 's quite unlike the clean invigorating air of your pulpit . I found there were ways of crying out and lifting my armed hand , then letting it drop without bloodshed . I found ways of letting sinners slip through my hands . I found I had returned to my old self The selves we were when my young wife and I were at the court of the old King . My black Puritan shadow still darkens the land . PALFREY Even in these last erring days , we honored you above all others . We trusted the Lord would give substance to your shadow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This question is insoluble . While I was hedging and compromising , I was in a state of chronic fever , enough to dizzy me , not enough to keep me from marching . I began to see that men are twisted , that nothing is clear , as King Charles and Archbishop Laud believe . Look , my hand is puffed and twisted with heat Well , bearing with diseases is the body 's fortune . PALFREY God forbid that we believe what Archbishop Laud believes . GOVERNOR JOHN ENDECOTT Ah , but you see , you do speak like the Archbishop : one Church , one creed , one priesthood . Each city is a Jerusalem : Rome , Geneva , London , and now Boston and Salem . I wonder what I am doing here . Flags of a hundred colors , they 're all made of cloth . p. 33 PALFREY There 's one faith and one flag . GOVERNOR JOHN ENDECOTT Listen to me . I had a dream last night . It will interest you . You are in it , Palfrey . It has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Something a-fire . PALFREY This foretells the burning of Merry Mount . GOVERNOR JOHN ENDECOTT No , I was sick with fever . This burning was only in my brain , in my dream I was you there , I was preaching from your pulpit in Salem . I was an apotheosis of you , much grander , much more royal , more like a Jesuit general . I was reading black sentences on the black page of a ribboned book . I had on black horn glasses without lenses . And read from a book whose print I could n't see . Behind me sat an old man  --  I think he was Almighty God . He looked like a dirty old Italian Pope . A yellow slop , like corn meal , oozed from the corner of his mouth . I was sorry God had fallen on bad times , but when I read my sentence , his ringed finger dropped trembling with approbation on my shoulder , and I shivered with fever and rapture . PALFREY You were mortally sick , but I think you were reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each time I read a sentence , I was sentencing a man to death ! Men ! I was sentencing men , not sinners ! But at first there were n't any men . I was staring at the blank glass window of your church , empty blue sky , empty sheep , an empty field . Something was burning . The air was full of black flakes , like bits of your black coat . I saw the church crowded with our own Boston and Salem people : Winthrops , Dudleys , Welds , Peterses ! I knew all the names . I could see so close , I could even see the insides of their houses . I was dressed in black and white like you . They were dressed in black and white . I held my hands over them to bless them , but my heart hurt inside me like the ball of the sun , because I was sending them out to be burned . p. 34 PALFREY No more , no more . GOVERNOR JOHN ENDECOTT In the end , when I had cleared the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I saw their armor melting down like lead . PALFREY KneelingLook , I am kneeling before you . You must join me and take comfort . GOVERNOR JOHN ENDECOTT In the end I was the only man in the world , I was alone and I was n't even myself . I was you , or some other preacher . I felt my heart soaking through my ribs like the brown juice of a crushed grasshopper . PALFREY join me . GOVERNOR JOHN ENDECOTT I was hacking thistles with the crude sort of sickle we make in America . I hit so awkwardly that two thistles grew up for each one I mutilated . Then I was hitting men with an ax . It was a warped American ax ; it hit askew . PALFREY Kneel ! Still standingTwo sprang up for each I felled . I could n't kill them . Green grass , blue sky ; and in all that vacancy , our flag , the Red Cross , was knocking and hacking in the wind . PALFREY Kneel ! GOVERNOR JOHN ENDECOTT KneelingAll men will surely die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ENDECOTT slowly gets to his feetMy mind is clear now . I do n't believe in evil dreams any more than you do , but I now understand statecraft : a statesman can either work with merciless efficiency and leave a desert ; or he can work in a hit-and-miss fashion , and leave a cesspool . Still , things are n't really bad here yet , the King has n't settled on his final course of action ; I can still delay , evade , pull the strings . p. 35 PALFREY You are talking statecraft . This is over my head . GOVERNOR JOHN ENDECOTT We are drawing the noose tight about our necks . Still , things are n't really bad yet . That time will come , that time will surely come  --  I knew the King 's mind , or rather the minds of his advisers  --  kings ca n't be said to have minds . The King will revoke our charter , he will quarter soldiers on us , he will impose his church system . PALFREY How can King Charles revoke our charter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is evil , but how can a king break his word ? GOVERNOR JOHN ENDECOTT The word of a king , the word of a king ! He dare not do anything else . Listen , if you could hear across the ocean , you would hear the grinding of the mill . We are the grinding . PALFREY Oh , God , have mercy on us ! All our labors here will perish . What will we do ? What will we do ? GOVERNOR JOHN ENDECOTT You will do nothing . You will cave in . You will give in to King Charles , even if he asks for your lives . Do you think that I , too , will do nothing ? I have little faith . The faith of the armies . I am only alive when I am fighting for my life . I detest this , but it is so . My ax can never be taken from me . My hand , my bare hand , is an ax . I will speak . p. 36 PALFREY You will speak ? GOVERNOR JOHN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harangue , half truth , half bombast . But let 's hope every word will be practical . It must stir soldier and preacher to fury . Then  --  no toleration , no quarter ! Everything here in America will be Bible , blood and iron . England will no longer exist . PALFREY I do n't understand what you mean by " England will no longer exist . " Will our new commonwealth still exist without England ? GOVERNOR JOHN ENDECOTT For us , there will be only a brief moment when our commonwealth will say , " I am , " then shut her eyes to the world . Sooner or later , we will go . Perhaps it will be soon , perhaps the King will send over an army , or the French will move down from the north , or the Dutch will move in from the south . Sooner or later , today , tomorrow or the day after , we will be gone . I will rejoice then , if I can say I 've had my black second of anguish and exultation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldiers are coming back . You are tired , your Excellency . Shall I speak for you and judge the prisoners ? GOVERNOR JOHN ENDECOTT You can announce any judgments you like . I will stand behind you and qualify them . The SERGEANT and SOLDIERS march back on stage , dragging three hysterical and drunken INDIANS . A SOLDIER holds three broken bows . PALFREY and ENDECOTT walk back and look at the prisoners p. 37 SERGEANT I threw two men out in front to make a noisy show , then marched my two others around the Indians ' flank . Maurice of Nassau 's trick . I caught the Indians in a vise . What shall we do with them , your Excellency ? GOVERNOR JOHN ENDECOTT Take over , Preacher Palfrey . We will have a practical exhibition of theocracy in action . PALFREY Take the Indians out of sight and shoot them . This plague must be smothered if we want our children to live in freedom . GOVERNOR JOHN ENDECOTT The man of God has spoken : Take the Indians out of sight ! There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Throw the Indians into the icehouse , and let them sober up on sawdust . A BEAR in pink stockings comes out . He dances and paws the air absurdly in front of ENDECOTT and PALFREY SERGEANT What shall we do with this beast , sir ? Shall we strap him to a post and whip him ? PALFREY A dancing bear ! He is against nature ! He must be a witch . Shoot him in the head ! GOVERNOR JOHN ENDECOTT Shoot the damned bear in the head , Sergeant ! The SERGEANT shoots the BEAR . It dies with antic gestures . The SERGEANT then leads out EDITH and EDWARD in their rainbow costumes p. 38 SERGEANT Here 's the King of the May and his wife . They are young and shining . What shall we do with them ? PALFREY Strap the King to a whipping post , and give him twice as many lashes as the others . His high station should set an example . EDWARD Speak like an Englishman , sir . If my hands were free , I 'd fight you off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for myself , but pray you not to touch my bride . We were just married . PALFREY We 'll give her something to remember her wedding day by ! We are not in the habit of wasting idle courtesies on women . We 're twice as strict with women . Sergeant , tie the King and Queen to a whipping post . GOVERNOR JOHN ENDECOTT Slowly , Mr. Palfrey , slowly . Weddings and birth Dreamily putting a hand on EDITH 's shoulderYou are too young , but that 's no disadvantage in a wife . EDITH Is your own wife in Salem , Governor Endecott ? She should come here and soften your judgment . GOVERNOR JOHN ENDECOTT What would my wife be doing in Salem ? She was a lovely and intelligent lady who died twenty-five years ago . Our child died with her . EDITH So you became a great Puritan . p. 39 GOVERNOR JOHN ENDECOTT Puts his hand on EDITH againYou are almost as beautiful Misfortune has fallen too early on you and your husband . You will have time to mend . Your husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ militia . You will come to Salem . You will probably bear children . I hope they will live . ENDECOTT walks slowly away , as if dreaming , then turns , picks up a large rose garland , and lays it over the heads of EDITH and EDWARD . He pauses , then in a loud voiceSergeant , march the King and Queen off , then disrobe them and give them something practical to wear . PALFREY Should n't the King 's curled hair be cropped ? GOVERNOR JOHN ENDECOTT The voice of divine inspiration has spoken . Sergeant , cut the King 's hair off in our attractive pumpkin-shell style ! EDITH and EDWARD are led off PALFREY AngrilyYour Excellency ! GOVERNOR JOHN ENDECOTT What was I to do , friend ? They are children . PALFREY Cleopatra and the Pope were children once . I know all I want to about such children . Remember Michael Wigglesworth 's lines on unbaptized children . These are worse than unbaptized . Sings in a nasal voiceThen to the bar they all drew nearwho 'd died in infancy ; they never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ womb into the tombhad dropped like rotten seed.No child had sinned , each child was damned ; they thus began to plead : " If for our own transgressionand disobedience , we here must stand on your left hand , just were the recompense ; but Adam 's guilt our souls has split , his fault is charged upon us , and that alone has overthrownour spirit and undone us . " Then God replied , " You sinners are , and sinners shall expectsuch as they 'll get , for I do savenone by my own elect . " MORTON , partly drunk , but more in a state of despairing recklessness , reels onto the stage with his arm around the INDIAN GIRL . He stands defiantly staring at the Puritans p. 40 THOMAS MORTON Very edifying verses , Minister . I do n't know which to admire more , your art or your morality . Look , I 'm a poet too . Squeezes the INDIAN GIRLThis is my poetry . We are your elect . The lamb will lie down with the lion . PALFREY I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your compositions . You 'll wish you 'd stuck to words and filthy songs , when we crop your ears , and bore your nose , and burn your house . SOLDIER We found Morton behind a tree ; he had a gun slanting on his knees . He was afraid to use it . THOMAS MORTON Everyone in this colony knows , your Excellency , I can hit a turkey 's head off at fifty yards . I could have shot you down any time in the last half hour . While you were posturing back and forth and talking to your preacher , I was sitting in the dark of my house , and my gun was pointing at you . Then this Indian lady came along and gave me something stronger to think on than killing . PALFREY Hand Morton over to me . I 'm trained for this . I 'll offer the criminal to the mercies of God . You will hear no more of him . THOMAS MORTON You ought to be in your own pillory of a strait jacket , you homicidal Bible-mangling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Endecott of Salem . p. 41 GOVERNOR JOHN ENDECOTT Morton , you are a foolish and swollen man with little future , and in that little , little to be envied ; but it seems I owe my life to your debaucheries . Do you know that I am going to suppress your settlement ? Think quickly . Your plantation is still standing . THOMAS MORTON Governor Endecott , we are both Englishmen . We were both gentlemen once . We have both carried the flag of England against the Catholics . I call on you to treat your brothers in arms with honor , and allow us our legal rights . GOVERNOR JOHN ENDECOTT This is the first time I 've heard of your campaigning , Mr. Morton . I am destroying you for selling whiskey and firearms to the Indians . Your Indians imperil my colony . THOMAS MORTON This is a legal and civil question , Mr. Endecott . Our courts in England will settle it . I am a lawyer myself . I have other good lawyers in my pay . You 'll make little headway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word , witness against witness . Of course , I know why you hate me . You hate me for belonging to our apostolic Church of England , for my devotion to our Book of Common Prayer . I love that book . GOVERNOR JOHN ENDECOTT Mr. Morton , your church and reading habits are neither here nor there . I am here to enforce moral decorum . Your May Days , they seem to come up once a month , are a horror . Your diseased men drink themselves insensible , and live with Indian women . Look , your mixed creatures , half white , half red , like our flag , are spreading through our colony . We can not last . p. 42 THOMAS MORTON Our May Days are lovely and human , they are a beautiful old English custom practiced by your ancestors and mine , Mr. Endecott . You Puritans walk in blinders . You look neither to the left nor to the right . You are only interested in trade . You beat up my Indians because they sell me the furs they refuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You are repeating yourself . You are losing your sense of sequence and logic . For your own health I will have to have you gagged . THOMAS MORTON You know , I do n't think you will have me tied or gagged . Do you know who this lady is ? She is the daughter of Assawamset , the great chief of the Narraganset , my blood brother . Perhaps , I 'll marry her . You ca n't stop me ! MORTON draws the girl to him , hugging her defiantly ENDECOTT stares at MORTON , stunned and confused , pauses , as if trying to hold down a burst of hysterical fury GOVERNOR JOHN ENDECOTT No , let her rest here for the moment . THOMAS MORTON I know what you want , but doubt if you do . You think you are the arm of God here , and wish you could fold that arm around this woman . You have a beautiful faith , one that leaves you free to kill the Indians and steal their lands and furs , but not free to sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows what we want or will have here . Many things , many things Faith might have kept us clean and free  --  yes , we thought that was possible for us once . Each day drags the day before it on stage , all its contrived and worried plot . No one is too clean or free . THOMAS MORTON I am myself and nothing else , when I look on this red woman , but you 'll never be free to trust your eye . Poor Endecott , you are far from home , an ocean and fifty years away . Remember old Charles V. Charles got his fill of running the Holy Roman Empire and retired to a monastery . I guess he did n't do much praying there , because people found him staring at three unassembled clocks . Each clock had the same vital part missing , say the pendulum and main spring . The Emperor kept staring at the clocks and-trying to fit them together into one perfect clock . Of course , he could n't , he did n't have the parts . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man of peace . My Indian allies are men of peace . I sell them guns to keep them from starving . I know your line . You want the Indian land . These are innocent of blood , but you 'd rather shoot them than breed with them . You can easily shoot them all . Then saint will live with saint . Then this continent will be a sea of sharks . PALFREY Do you know how many Englishmen , saints as you call them , we have here ? p. 44 THOMAS MORTON Two or three thousand . PALFREY Do you know how many Indians occupy this land ? THOMAS MORTON Two or three million . PALFREY Do you want our stock to run out like a trickle into the Atlantic ? GOVERNOR JOHN ENDECOTT We are few here , we are no thicker than a hair . THOMAS MORTON Have no fear of their numbers . God is with you . You can shoot them all , unless someone gives them guns . Then God may think twice before taking sides . GOVERNOR JOHN ENDECOTT Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have wished to be merciful . It 's true we want the Indian lands , but they have not been innocent . Each time we have tried to hold back , some new act of savage violence has forced us forward . This new world , this world , I fear it will be washed in blood before we can live here together . Perhaps , when we are all dead , there 'll be a government , a just and kind government at last . THOMAS MORTON And for the present , you are content to attack me . Hold off . If you touch me , you 'll face the guns and knives of my blood brother , Assawamset . GOVERNOR JOHN ENDECOTT Morton 's guns and knives . No , I do n't think so . Assawamset is dead . I had to have him killed . p. 45 THOMAS MORTON You are lying . He was the king of the forest . No Puritan could get to him . GOVERNOR JOHN ENDECOTT After Judge Bowden 's murder , I was weary and worn and had no heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settle with Assawamset . Then by a miracle , a day 's march out of Salem , we came on this Indian . I call him the executioner . Points to the INDIAN SOLDIERHis brother was knifed in the back by Assawamset . He gladly showed us where his old tribe was encamped on an island in the swamp by Great Hope Neck . I stationed my men in a circle . There was no cover ; it was scarcely possible for an Indian to escape . Then , led by Providence , Assawamset came out to ease himself , naked except for his small breeches and stockings . We fired at him , putting one bullet into his heart , and another two inches higher . When we fished him out of the swamp he was a doleful , great , naked , dirty , dead beast . THOMAS MORTON You swear he is dead . I say he is still alive . GOVERNOR JOHN ENDECOTT You 'll recognize his hand , I think . It is a remarkable hand , not just for its great size , but from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exploding in his fist . Pause . ENDECOTT turns to the INDIAN SOLDIER p. 46 GOVERNOR JOHN ENDECOTT Executioner ! The INDIAN steps forward and throws the hand at MORTON 's feet . The INDIAN GIRL gives a muffled cry , but nobody pays attentionThat business is over . EXECUTIONER When I came on his body , I said , " Assawamset , you 've been a very big man , you 've made many men afraid of you . Now big as you are , I will chop you in pieces . " I chopped him into a hundred chunks . I got a penny for each chunk . That 's all the reward I had ; except for the glory of killing our chief . THOMAS MORTON I congratulate you , Mr. Endecott , on your proof of conquest . I admire how graciously you transmute disloyal savages into servile dissenters . You know , I have been calling you Governor for courtesy , but you really are no longer a governor . That title is now as empty and hollow as your heart . I have the king @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will excuse me . This is Mr. Blackstone of the Church of England . He has a message for you from King Charles . Speak , Mr. Blackstone , for our Church and our King ! MR . BLACKSTONE Are you Mr. Endecott ? GOVERNOR JOHN ENDECOTT I am Endecott . MR . BLACKSTONE Mr. Endecott , I am a personal friend of Archbishop Laud . I have had audiences with King Charles . I am their emissary . I hope you will realize that you are no longer talking to Mr. Morton . In England , we have a systematic and dignified way of dealing with you Puritan squires . p. 47 PALFREY He is a man who can not bear even the corrupt rule of his own corrupt church ! He has come to preach evil in the wilderness , he crowned the May King and Queen ! GOVERNOR JOHN ENDECOTT Let his Reverence talk , Mr. Palfrey , he told us he was a systematic and dignified man . MR . BLACKSTONE Please attend me , Mr. Endecott . Do you recognize that flag above our doorway ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BLACKSTONE I asked you if you recognized the flag of England ! GOVERNOR JOHN ENDECOTT I recognize the flag of England . MR . BLACKSTONE I represent the flag of England in America . In the King 's name , I tell you that the King has appointed him a tribunal for New England . The head of the tribunal is Archbishop Laud . Do you know Archbishop Laud , Mr. Endecott ? PALFREY Laud is a priest of Baal ! GOVERNOR JOHN ENDECOTT You must excuse the Elder , Mr. Blackstone , he is religious . I know Archbishop Laud , though I 'm afraid I have n't the advantage of his personal friendship . MR . BLACKSTONE The tribunal for New England has appointed a Royal Governor : the Royal Governor will be Sir Ferdinando Gorges . Do you know Sir Ferdinando Gorges , Mr. Endecott ? p. 48 PALFREY Sir Ferdinando Gorges is our arch-oppressor . He tried to destroy our colony before we existed ! GOVERNOR JOHN ENDECOTT I know Sir Ferdinando , Mr. Blackstone . We were young men at the court of King James together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think . THOMAS MORTON I imagine you know then , Endecott , that Sir Ferdinando and I are table companions . We are like brothers . When he comes here as a Royal Governor , I shall be at his right hand . You had better win me over , Endecott ; my policy is to live and let live . I am slow to anger . You still have time . MR . BLACKSTONE Mr. Endecott , do you realize that your authority and that of Governor Winthrop of Boston and Governor Bradford of Plymouth will end when Royal Governor Gorges arrives ? PALFREY Ask to see this order in writing , your Excellency ! Tell him we will appeal to the courts in England . GOVERNOR JOHN ENDECOTT You are learning statecraft , Palfrey . I am afraid this order will be very clear . And the courts of England ! England has shelved in on us . There is no England ! MR . BLACKSTONE You see how easily I manage them , Morton ? I speak a few authoritative and logical words , and they collapse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Mr. Endecott . Our new methods have worked wonders in England . p. 49 GOVERNOR JOHN ENDECOTT Will the royal bureaucracy be imposed on New England ? MR . BLACKSTONE You will have an orderly and systematic government , Mr. Endecott . GOVERNOR JOHN ENDECOTT Will the discipline and ceremonial of the Church of England be imposed on New England ? MR . BLACKSTONE You will be given an aesthetic , rational and systematic religion , Mr. Endecott . GOVERNOR JOHN ENDECOTT You see , this is the time I told you of , Mr. Palfrey . We have little to choose between the corruption of Morton And the ruthless systematizing of Archbishop Laud . They will give us no quarter . This is the day of terror ! PALFREY God have mercy on us ! GOVERNOR JOHN ENDECOTT I will have to speak to my soldiers . THOMAS MORTON Sings , like a Handel oratorioJupiter thunders , and the Separatists burst asunder !

SERGEANT Form three sides of a hollow square , soldiers . GOVERNOR JOHN ENDECOTT Have my men ground arms and stand at attention ! SERGEANT Ground arms ! Attention ! GOVERNOR JOHN ENDECOTT Sergeant , order the drummer to beat his drum ! SERGEANT Drummer , beat your drum ! GOVERNOR JOHN ENDECOTT To PALFREYThis is a calamitous moment for us . Give us a brief prayer . PALFREY May God guard and guide our Governor in all his actions ! GOVERNOR JOHN ENDECOTT Soldiers  --  or must we be called exiles , now that England has sunk below the horizon Look out to ocean , you will not see it ; it is invisible to us . All this long and injured day , we have worked without words , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ melted before us ; they are gone like ice in the breath of summer . All this was for nothing . We , who came up from nowhere , are sentenced to return to nowhere . I want you to remember the country we sailed from . p. 51 SOLDIERS England ! England ! GOVERNOR JOHN ENDECOTT England , it is an excellent country , if this can be said of a kingdom . The Germans gave us gravity and a heart for beer ; the Normans , cruelty and reason . In a hundred fair battles , we have stopped the galloping French and headlong Scot . We cracked them , then charged them to panic and perdition . We have pacified their kingdoms , and held them like slaves under our iron prong . We have lived through civil wars , they were prettily called the Wars of the Roses , they were without intention or beauty ; the opposing captains were indistinguishable , a malevolence , pressed into power by an unintelligible cause . The defeated soldiers were murdered in the field , often by their own kinsmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood paths of the great Lords . We have shaken off the greedy , meddling Latin Pope . We have robbed the Spanish fleets ; their hulks and chivalry rot on the ocean 's bottom from Cadiz to the Isthmus . Europe sleeps in the shadow of our fear , and England is at peace . THOMAS MORTON Perhaps your illiterate , Bible-drumming soldiers need this history lesson ; Mr. Blackstone and I do n't . GOVERNOR JOHN ENDECOTT You see our flag , the Red Cross ; it still flies high ; my arms are nailed to this cross , fighting under it for three kings and thirty years . England still lies behind us ; it is crowded and complicated , everything time and tradition could give a country is there . I learned its customs once so that I might live . My wife and child lie buried there . p. 52 SOLDIERS England ! England ! THOMAS MORTON This is well spoken , Mr. Endecott . GOVERNOR JOHN ENDECOTT I imagine that my love and service for England can withstand even your admiration , Mr. Morton Soldiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Surely , it was n't disappointment : I was well spoken of , sought after , and incessantly burdened with commissions in court and field . You , too , according to your talent and condition , were men of some standing in your counties ; you had cottages and fields . I had an old stone house with servants . Why did I come to this waste of animals , Indians , and the nine-month winter ? To this place that has the wildness of the whole world in it  --  God 's work , God 's work , if any care , before he thought of life . Boulders and tree roots have broken our plowshares , our children have cried for bread , we have torn mussels from the rocks to feed them . Why did we come here ? THOMAS MORTON My children have richer food than tree roots and mussels . GOVERNOR JOHN ENDECOTT If you interrupt me again , Mr. Morton , I 'll hang you by your heels to your Maypole , or perhaps your neck ! Soldiers , I was telling how we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renew the world ; look about you , you will see we have painfully cleared the true path , our rough paths to the land of promise . Will Charles Stuart stop us ? That savage , that Scotchman , that peacock who spends more money on clothes than any woman in the Kingdom ? Yet Charles had excellent forebears : King James , who slobbered , his life the life of a bitch , one uninterrupted heat for the glittering boys ? Or Queen Mary ? She did what James dreamed of , a world whore , a French agent , a common murderess , who blew her husband up with powder . Her death at the block shows us perhaps how treacherously the Divine Will overshadows her grandson 's crown . p. 53 MR . BLACKSTONE This is treason , Mr. Endecott ! You will be sent to the Tower . You will be beheaded . GOVERNOR JOHN ENDECOTT I am coming to your future , Mr. Blackstone . Soldiers , King Charles is going to hand us over to Bishop Laud , Old Thorough , our most logical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together . They have appointed a Governor General . The Governor General is going to establish the corrupt Church of England here . There will be a Roman bishop in every county , a priest in every parish . SOLDIERS God save us from King Charles ! GOVERNOR JOHN ENDECOTT If the King and Bishop have their way , there will be a cross and high altar in every meeting house , a titled clerk in every office ; you will serve under good-for-nothing gentlemen lieutenants . Candles will burn at noonday even on the steps to the pulpit . Will you wait for this without drawing a sword ? Without firing a gun , without killing ? SOLDIERS God save us ! GOVERNOR JOHN ENDECOTT No ! We shall make a stand in this land , we shall stand on this land that we have brought our possessions to , that we have cleared with our axes , that we have broken with our plows , that we have pacified with our guns , that we have sanctified with our prayers . God has brought us here , our manhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bishops ? What have we to do with anointed kings ? What have we to do with England ? p. 54 SOLDIERS What have we to do with England ? GOVERNOR JOHN ENDECOTT Bring me our standard , the Red Cross of England ! SERGEANT Yes , sir . GOVERNOR JOHN ENDECOTT Sergeant , tear the Red Cross from its staff ! SERGEANT I am afraid to I am a soldier ! I served against Spain under this flag . GOVERNOR JOHN ENDECOTT It 's nothing . Draws his sword and cuts the Red Cross from its staff . It falls to the ground at his feetBefore God and man , I stand by my act ! We shall have no pope or tyrant or mother country in New England ! No flag shall stand between us and our God ! SOLDIERS No flag shall stand between us and our God ! They cheer ENDECOTT . Drums are beaten MR . BLACKSTONE This is treason and blasphemy ! GOVERNOR JOHN ENDECOTT Sergeant , tie up Mr. Blackstone . Morton is quiet at last , but you 'd better tie him up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ENDECOTT Sergeant , take these people of Merry Mount away . PausesWait a minute . Let those people go out in their own way . They can do their foolish May Day dance , if they must . The REVELLERS dance the stately dance they danced previously . Their manner is quite changed , they perform pathetically and wiltingly p. 55 REVELLERS Fair and fair , and twice so fair , as fair as any may be , the fairest shepherd on our green , and love for any lady . EDWARD and EDITH lead the dance . He is now in gray clothes and has cropped hair . EDITH is also dressed in grayFair and fair , and twice so fair , listen to Cupid 's curse:all they who change old love for new , pray God they change for worse . GOVERNOR JOHN ENDECOTT This is the last masque that will be heard in New England . Sergeant , take these people away ! SERGEANT Yes , sir . GOVERNOR JOHN ENDECOTT Then go to the icehouse and release the Indians . Take them out in a field and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes INDIAN GIRL off stage GOVERNOR JOHN ENDECOTT Sergeant , when our men are finished with the Indians , they can start burning down the houses of Merry Mount . SERGEANT Yes , sir . GOVERNOR JOHN ENDECOTT Tomorrow , we will burn the Indian village . p. 56 SERGEANT Yes , sir . The SOLDIERS , with the REVELLERS , leave . ENDECOTT stands alone , brooding . PALFREY comes up to him GOVERNOR JOHN ENDECOTT I 've made my speech and performed my act . The earth has n't swallowed us . PALFREY The earth has swallowed them . What are you going to do ? GOVERNOR JOHN ENDECOTT I should ask for a day of mourning in the colony , or better my own day of mourning , for the people we have sent into misery , desperation  --  that I have sent out of life : my own soldiers , the turncoat Indians who served our turn , and for the other Indians , all those who are fighting with unequalled ferocity , and probably hopeless courage , because they prefer annihilation to the despair of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lot 's wife was turned into a pillar of salt for looking backward . GOVERNOR JOHN ENDECOTT Oh , stop it , Palfrey ! You need a rest . Go out and watch the Indians die : they deserve the blessing of your presence . PALFREY Yes , your Excellency . As PALFREY leaves , the SERGEANT comes running on p. 57 SERGEANT You have given no orders for our treatment of the Merry Mount people . Shall I double their punishments ? GOVERNOR JOHN ENDECOTT No , I do n't think so . We are burning down their houses . I 'll do something tomorrow . Or the next day . I will delay and wait on Providence . SERGEANT Yes , sir . He leaves the stage ENDECOTT remains alone for a few moments , head down and brooding . He lifts the fallen Red Cross of England with his foot . The glow of Merry Mount burns at the back of the stage . Screams , etc .
