The scene at Uppsala smacked more of a New Left " demo " than of a religious body in pious conference . Two student pickets who attempted a sidewalk teach-in were dragged off by Swedish cops . Some conferees slipped away to watch an underground flick replete with scenes of pot-smoking derelicts , shaggy folk singers and a minister who-in anguish at the chaos and cacophony of life in the cities-strips to the buff atop his pulpit . In other ways as well , the 701 Protestant , Anglican and Orthodox delegates to the World Council of Churches ' Fourth Assembly were exposed last week to an array of provocative ideas . <P> The central theme of speeches and skull sessions alike was the gulf between rich and poor nations , and the moral dilemma posed by that fact for churchmen . Zambia 's President Kenneth Kaunda struck the keynote - " the end of an era of optimism , " and the " disappointment and disillusionment " of the newly independent nations . In underdeveloped countries , he charged , the West " seeks only maximum profit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the rich man 's table .

Economist Barbara Ward deplored the " air of platitude , lassitude and repetition " that infuses the affluent world 's " war " against poverty . She called for a tax on developed countries equal to 1% of their gross national products . The lien-$17 billion-would go directly to poor lands , and would amount to only one-third of the West 's annual increase in combined G.N.P. , Dr. Ward contended . " It just means getting richer slower between Christmas and Easter , and that includes Lent . Let us tuck away in one corner of our Christian memory the delicious fact that the English-and French-speaking members of the Atlantic world spend $50 billion a year on drink and tobacco . " <P> Most moving to the churchmen was an address on Christianity and the Negro by Novelist James Baldwin . The Negro 's freedom , Baldwin charged in an odd metaphorical mix , has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Christ I was presented with , though he was born in Nazareth under a very hot sun , was presented to me with blue eyes and blond hair ; and all the virtues to which I , as a black man , was expected to aspire had by definition to be white .
