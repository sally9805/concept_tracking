Natural gas is one of nature 's richest prizes , and the hunt for it increases in tempo as the world 's need for power grows . Right now , the biggest , the most expensive and the most melodramatic search is taking place in Europe 's North Sea . Convinced that the North Sea covers the world 's biggest bubble of natural gas , such major oil companies as Esso , Shell , Texaco and British Petroleum are scrambling to win a share of it , plan to spend $100 million on exploration and test drilling in the next three years . The stakes are so great ( billions of dollars in gas sales to the Common Market ) that last week the question of who owns the gas caused a formal debate in the Dutch Parliament , and was the subject of hot discussion in the German Bundestag . " It is like cutting up a plum pudding , " explains Royal Dutch Petroleum President John H. Loudon . " Everyone wants the piece with the sixpence in it . " <P> Out to Sea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since Esso and Shell in 1960 found a mammoth gas pocket ( estimated reserves : 1 trillion cubic meters ) in the Dutch coastal province of Groningen , near the German frontier . Studying their maps , they concluded that the pocket extended far beyond Groningen out under the sea , last year began exploring the bottom . Seismographic tests were unanimous ; though no gas has actually been found at sea , geologists are now convinced that the North Sea hides tens of trillions of cubic meters of gas , dwarfing even the two trillion cubic meters under the Texas Panhandle , long thought to be the world 's largest gas field . <P> Drilling was started off the Dutch coast , but the biggest pockets of gas are now thought to lie in the waters off Germany . Bonn 's Ministry for Economic Affairs has more than 25 requests for permission to drill in German waters , including one by the German-American North Sea Consortium that includes Socony Mobil , Indiana Standard and Esso . The consortium is prepared to spend $25 million this year and next drilling for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drill near the island of Borkum . <P> Hot &; Disputatious . The trouble is that the consortium already has permission to drill from the coastal states of Lower Saxony , Schleswig-Holstein , Hamburg and Bremen , whose right to grant such permission is now hotly disputed by Bonn . An even thornier question is how to divide mineral rights between Germany and Holland , as well as among Denmark , Norway and Great Britain , all of whom front on the North Sea . Hope that these five nations could deal objectively with the issue looks dim . " It seems to us that countries that in past ages have had only trouble from the sea , " said Rotterdam 's Algemeen Dagblad , " now should be allowed to have full profits from that sea . " With similar reactions echoing through other capitals , the signs were for a hot and disputatious summer along the sandy shores of the North Sea .
