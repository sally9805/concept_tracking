For four days , Algeria reeled through the delirium of independence . When Premier Benyoussef Benkhedda of the F.L.N. Provisional Government arrived in Algiers , he was hailed by a half-million cheering Moslems waving green-white-and-red flags . Benkhedda was swept from his Jeep , borne shoulder-high through the ecstatic crowd , losing his habitual dark glasses on the way . But behind the cheers and the swirling flags lay a new threat to the tortured country . Now that the terror campaign waged by the Secret Army against the Moslems had at long last subsided , the Moslems began to fight among themselves , haunted by the familiar specter of all successful revolutions : fratricidal war between the moderate and extremist wings . <P> The Antagonists . The two opposing factions are headed by Premier Benkhedda and his Vice Premier , Mohammed ben Bella , two men as different in personality as in politics . <P> Benkhedda , 42 , resembles his nickname , " M'sieu Tout le Monde " ( Mr. Everybody ) . With a diffident manner and an emotionless voice , he is not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolutions . But he is a tough , machine-minded organization man who fought skillfully as a terrorist against the French , and is proving equally adept at intraparty warfare . His opponent , Ben Bella , 45 , was one of the nine founders of the F.L.N. ( only four others are alive today ) , a passionate orator and " activist , " and still an authentic hero to millions of Algerians . In 1949 he held up the Oran central post office to get funds for the revolution , was later captured by the French , and escaped from jail . In 1956 Ben Bella and three other top leaders of the F.L.N. were arrested when their Moroccan plane was intercepted by the French , and he spent the next five years in French prisons . After France and the F.L.N. signed the Evian truce agreements , Ben Bella was released , and soon let it be known that he accepted neither the policy nor the authority of Benkhedda . Ben Bella may be no Communist , but he spouts the Marxist line and would work with the Communists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> The men with whom Ben Bella has most in common are the top military lead ers of the F.L.N. army units stationed in Tunisia and Morocco . Unlike the 70,000 F.L.N. guerrillas inside Algeria-most of whom seemed loyal to Benkhedda-the Tunisian and Moroccan detachments have done little fighting against the French . They are uniformed and disciplined men . armed with Russian and Czech weapons , indoctrinated by Marxist commissars . <P> The Conspiracy . Ben Bella first tried to win power last May . Then , he claims , the National Revolutionary Council , the quasi-parliamentary body of F.L.N. , backed him against Benkhedda , who simply ignored the council 's wishes . Ben Bella was persuaded not to bring the fight out into the open until independence was gained . Meanwhile he joined with lean , tuberculous Colonel Houari Boumedienne , F.L.N. army commander outside Algeria , in working out a plot to seize power . On independence day , F.L.N. army detachments from Tunisia and Morocco were to cross into Algeria , declare the Provisional Government invalid , and call on Ben Bella to form a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
