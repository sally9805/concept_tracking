Notes and Comment THE New York World 's Fair may not have attracted as many foreign exhibitions as some World 's Fairs of the past , but it surely must hate broken the world 's World 's Fair record for amassing domestic public-relations men . Every few days , it seems , we run across the handiwork of a public-relations man assigned by the Fair to some aspect of our daily routine . Several weeks ago , the Public-Relations Man in Charge of Subways  --  described in the Times as " a public relations representative who is a consultant to the Transit Authority on behalf of the New York World 's Fair " ? asked the National Broadcasting Company to assure its viewers that an N.B.C . drama in which two young thugs terrorized the passengers of a subway car was fictional , since anybody who thought that such a thing could happen in a New York subway might change his mind about coming to the Fair , especially if he had been looking forward to the pleasant adventure of an I.R.T. ride to Flushing Meadow . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three day s earlier an off-duty detective had been shot to death on the I.R.T. by thugs very much like those in the television play . The refusal evoked no comment from the Public-Relations Man in Charge of Subways , who was probably busy telling the Public-Relations Man in Charge of Central Park how to inform potential Fairgoers that nobody ever gets mugged there . ) Last week , we gradual ! ) began to notice the efforts of another transportation expert , the Public-Relations Man in Charge of Taxicabs . We have always liked to imagine that the variety of color combinations in two-tone taxicabs is the result of the unexpectedly whimsical nature of body-shop foremen or the diverse fashion ? stes of independent cabbies ' wives ; if cab companies hire color consultants to discover what combinations are likely to attract the soot-filled eye of a weary shopper , we 'd rather not know about it But lately we have been unable to escape the conclusion that a more purposeful hand is guiding the paint-sprayer ; almost every second cab seems to he orange and blue  --  New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the World 's Fair . The Public-Relations Man in Charge of Taxicabs must have figured that people who come to New York to see the World 's Fair  --  those who have not been frightened off by the National Broadcasting Company  --  might forget the reason for their visit if they were not constantly reminded by orange-and-blue taxicabs . He obviously chose this form of reminder on the theory that the orange-andblue combination is too unattractive to be the colors of any school or university , and therefore is bound to remind visitors only of the World 's Fair . In this supposition , he is wrong . Danbury High School , in Danbury , Connecticut , and the University of Florida , in Gainesville , Florida , come to mind immediately as two places where the cheering section is likely to he heard screaming " Go , you Orange and Blue ! " Knowing that public-relations men rarely allow any such small error to slow the progress of what strikes them as a good idea , we can only hope that in the time remaining before the opening of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not chosen to be the Public-Relations Man in Charge of Buildings . Rent Strike E drove uptown the other day to the headquarters of the Community Council on Housing , to talk with Jesse Gray , the director of the Council and the organizer of the current rent strike in Harlem . We rode past the tall , pale apartment buildings on Park Avenue in the Sixties and Seventies , and past the small shops and galleries on Madison in the Eighties , turned into 117th Street , and stopped between rows of dark , dilapidated tenements just east of Fifth Avenue , in front of a store that looked abandoned . A partly obscured sign in the window read " Community Council . " We knocked on a knobless red door set at an angle to the sidewalk , but no one answered , so we tapped on the window . A Negro man appeared , looked out at us , and. , after a moment , opened the door . " Mr. Gray ? " we asked . " I 'm IVIr . Brown , " the man said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a desk , a couple of chairs , a wall telephone , and a typewriter on a table . A white youth wearing a brightly striped scarf had just answered the phone . He handed it to Mr. Brown and introduced himself to us as Danny Schechter , a member of the Northern Student Movement . He told us that Mr. Gray was on the phone in the next room , which was his office , and gave us a handbill advertising a Mass Rent Strike Rally . He was a senior at Cornell , he said , but had decided to leave college for a while . Mr. Brown , on the phone , was saving , " Ve need help . We need all the help we can get , " and we heard a voice in Mr. Gray 's office saying that the Board of Estimate had just informally approved the appropriation of a million dollars for a campaign against rats . A moment later , Mr. Gray , a middle-sized Negro with a mustache and an energetic manner , came out of the next room and invited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , a woman entered the store and announced to Mr. Brown that she had no heat . Shoving a chair against the door to keep it shut , Mr. Gray explained that the Community Council on Housing was the latest name of an organization that had come into existence about ten years ago , when he had first become involved in housing problems ; his apartment had been without heat for a week , and so he had founded the Council . " I was cold , " he said . Carpenters were working in another part of the store , and rum time to time the screech of a saw forced the conversation to a shout . " The Council 's official concern is improved housing for Negroes and Puerto Ricans , " Mr. Gray said , " but once you walk into a house , you end up trying to deal with all the problems that you find in that house . " He smiled , and went on , " The rent strike is n't a new idea . The publicity and the action we 're getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this country . There was a Petition for Heat and Hut Water back in 1913 , and we held a rent strike in 1959 , with ten or fifteen buildings participating . That forced improvements in eight of the buildings . " The phone on Mr. Gray 's desk rang . He enswered it , and advised the caller to call Roy Campanei la 's Liquor Store , on West 134th Street . " Wrong number , " he explained to us , and continued , " At tie moment , there are two hundred and three buildings on strike , and by next week there will he over two hundred and fifty . Before striking , the tenants in a building hold a house meeting , and get the Buildings Department to make an inspection for violations . Seventy-five per cent of the tenants must agree to strike and to pay their rents into some kind of account  --  escrow . Sometimes they 're afraid to strike , or they weaken later . Maybe the landlord turns on the heat , and they decide he 's not so had . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't happen so often . " Mr. Gray became silent , and then said , " You ought to talk to somebody who 's been bitten by a rat . I do n't know what kind of people the landlords are . All I know is that they do n't give heat and hot water . Most landlords are like rats . " Struck by greater possibilities for his rat simile , Mr. Gray said , " The tenants arc like rats now . Rats feel their power , and they come out in broad daylight and just sit there . Once the tenants feel their power , they stop running , they 're not afraid any more . We 've shown them --  -- and they see now  --  that they have rights whether they live on Park Avenue or on Lenox Avenue . The court decisions in the past three weeks have helped , and we 've put pressure on Mayor ' Wagner . The city government has power that it can use now it can take over buildings and make repairs under present laws . If the landlord thought he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to pay a stiff fine , there 'd he heat and hot water . Our most important aim is to give the people a consciousness of their rights . Then landlords will wake up downtown and come uptown and see what is happening . " Danny Schechter pushed the door open , stuck his head in , and said that he was going out to look for someone to paint a sign and for someone to drive a truck . As we got up to go , the phone rang . Mr. Gray answered it , then put his hand over the mouthpiece in order to say goodbye to us . " A man came to me today who was bitten by a rat in December , " he said . " He woke up , and there was a rat sitting on his chest ! Have you ever seen a rat The man was poisoned . He has to go hack to the hospital now , and he may die . " ? INCIDENTAL INTELLIGENCE ( RALLY ROUND THE ROCKS AND RILLS , XENOPHOBIC BOYS , DIVISION ) : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laboratory , at Yale , bears the title " Unamerican Geology . " Syn &'sthesia; A we were heating our way down Madison Avenue one afternoon last week , tacking back and forth against a bitter wind and putting into doorways for warmth , a sudden , fortuitous gust blew us into the Cordier &; Ekstrom Gallery , at Seventy-sixth Street , where a show called " For Eyes 8 : Ears " was in progress . We gazed about in wild surmise . Paintings , sculptures , and assemblages by twenty-seven artists surrounded us , and nearly every one was making a noise of some kind . Just to the right of the door , Allan d'Arcangelo 's " Metronomes , " in the form of windshield wipers on a sheet of black glass , was making metronomic windshield-wiper sounds . From Alfonso Ossorio 's treelike " Adam and Eve " came lifelike Birdsong , produced , logically , by a live bird in a cage . A tape recorder attached to Bruce Conner 's " Tick Tock Jelly Clock Cosmotron " gave out chthonian noises , suggestive of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ortman and a small gray box by Robert Morris , placed side by side , emitted rival . versions of an amplified human heartbeat . Two sculptors , Paul Brach and Takis , had enlisted the aid of two avant-garde composers , Earl Brown and Morton Feldman , to lend musical voices to their sculptures , while a musicianturned-sculptor , Joe Jones , had concocted a fantastic no-man hand called " Music Set , " consisting of an upside-down skeleton of an umbrella , from whose splayed ribs hung a cymbal , bells , a violin , and eleven small drums , all of which burst into action when some switches were flipped . A highly learned exhibition note by Nicolas Calas , one of the organizers of the show , informed us that what we were so happily experiencing was " synacsthcsia , in which the stimulation of the auditory sense is accompanied by illusions of color , and the stimulation of the visual sense by illusions of sound . " Not until Jones ' " Music Set " suffered a temporary breakdown did we manage to tear ourself away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Howard Wise Gallery , on West Fifty-seventh Street , where another group show , called " On the Move , " offered kinetic sculptures by some of the artists we had just seen exhibited at Cordier &; Ekstrom and by many others as well . More sounds , more synaesthesia ! Small , motorized Tinguely sculptures whirred and twittered . A hanging " Cone Forest , " by Ivan Chermayeff , murmured softly . At the far end of the big room we spied Len Lye , whose " tangible motion " sculptures are , to our mind , among the most beautiful kinetic works anywhere . " Conic here and look at this ! " he called . We went over and found him tinkering with a recent piece of his called " Loop , " a ring of polished steel , five feet in diameter and six inches wide , whose natural camber , he said , caused it to spring into sinuous motion when it was activated by an electrical impulse . Lye and an electrician were changing the timing of the electrical impulse , and the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " High-tempered high-carbon steel . Marvellous stuff , " said Lye , patting it affectionately . " Listen . " He pushed down on the top of the ring , released it , and , as the steel sprang into action , rapped it smartly with the flat of his hand . A clear , fluctuating tone rang out . He tapped it with a cigarette lighter , and a different tone joined the first . " We 'll get these in parks and gardens , and have tapes of the sounds they make playing along with them  --  have them dancing to their own music , you know . Marvellous ! " We agreed . Back in our office at last , what should we find on our desk but a note from Jason Seley , a sculptor who now works exclusively with cut and welded automobile bumpers . The note was an invitation to come down to his studio , on East Thirteenth Street , that evening for a " Concert of Compositions and Improvisations " by Herbert A. Deutsch , part of which was to be performed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly cancelled our tickets to the Philharmonic , and heat our way down to Thirteenth Street , where we found Seley , Deutsch , and five assisting musicians , all in formal dress and all beaming with anticipation as they set out the last of two hundred folding chairs . At the far end of the studio  --  a spacious one , on the ground floor of the building  --  was a wooden platform , on which stood a piano entirely hemmed in by softly gleaming bumper sculptures . " We sent out four hundred invitations , and we 're hoping two hundred will come , " said &ley,; who is dark-haired , forty-four , and genial . " We 've had the idea of the concert for about two years , I guess . Both Herb and I teach at Hofstra College , on Long Island , you see , and our classrooms are close together . Before I got this studio , I used to do all m3 work out there , and Herb 's music students were always wandering in and banging away on my sculptures and saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' The idea just sort of evolved . About six weeks ago , Herb and I said to ourselves ' Wen , why not ? ' and started getting ready . The musicians are all Hofstra students , or else former students  --  like Steven Elmer , the percussionist , who dropped out last year and makes his living now as a jazz musician . Steve came in a couple of weeks ago and tested all my sculptures and picked out the three whose sound he liked best . Herb has done a lot of electronic experimentation ; he made a tape mix over Christmas vacation to go with the percussion sounds . He and Steve have been rehearsing together for about a week . It 's an improvisation , but not completely ; each one knows what the other 's likely to do . " Deutsch went up on the stage and started stripping off the top of the piano , so that he could have access to the strings during the performance . " We had quite a time with the piano tuner this afternoon , Herb , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for decoration , and I said no , they were going to be used in the concert ' Do people like this kinda stuff ? ' he asked . I said some people did . ' Well , ' he said , thank goodness after all these years we still have Guy Lombardo and Lawrence Welk ! ' Excuse me. f think I hear somebody at the door . " The studio began to fill up with synaesthetes , including artists and sculptors , Hofstra students and faculty members , and Miss Dorothy Miller , from the Museum of Modern Art , which had Seley 's bumpers in its recent " Americans 1963 " show . 111 eight-forty-five , most of the seats were occupied . Seley turned off the lights , and the concert began . Electronic-tape sounds com bined with live piano sounds ( Deutsch ) and ohne sounds ( David Hoffman ) made up the first composition . Flute , cello , piano , alto-voice , and conventional percussion sounds made up the second . Then , amid rising expectations , Elmer took the stage , solo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mallets . He started softly , with brushes , against a background of Deutsch 's tape mix . Changing to mallets , he addressed one of the gleaming bumper constructions and let fly . A sculptural medley with echoes of the auto-repair shop ! Another sculpture took voice , and another . Louder and louder rang the bumpers . Faster and faster heat Elmer . At the end , there was frenzied applause , with shouts of " Bravo ! " After an intermission came a performance of Deutsch 's " A Christmas Carol The Spirit of Christmas Present " ( on tape ) , which was followed by two percussive , improvisations by Deutsch and Elmer , the first improvisation being tape-recorded in performance and then played as background to the second . Elmer outdid himself , reaching new heights of bumper virtuosity . " Encore ! Encore ! " cried the audience . We waved goodbye to Seley and Deutsch , and headed for home . ?

LIS ANIMALS KEEP ALOOF The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steady advance toward luxury in pleasure boats might some-day produce a yacht only a trifle less comfortable than a cramped two-room apartment on land , we were happy to read in a press release from the 1964 National Motor Boat Show that " rich , plush comfort seems to he the direction that builders of cruisers and runabouts , in both inboard and outboard versions , are taking in earnest , " and that " it is a rare runabout , for instance , that does not have upholstered seats and complete equipment as standard , and most of the cruisers are equipped right down to full carpeting and color-keyed interiors . " We had to admit to ourself that we 'd been in a number of two-room apartments that were neither fully carpeted nor color-keyed , and we were further impressed by the information , two or three paragraphs down the page , that " the largest boat in the Show is the 43-foot Double Cabin Pacemaker cruiser built by C. P. Leek and Sons , which ... includes an electric dishwasher , removing the last obstacle to cruising fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people we know is a morbid fear of the water , but , always being interested in seeing anybody 's obstacle to fun removed , and having gained from the release the additional information that " the Show also has a real live queen , " we waded through the slush to the Coliseum . The Queen , we learned from the first official we encountered , was somewhere in the building and would he happy to meet us in half an hour . We devoted that half hour to scrutinizing four floors of boats . Most of the boats had romantic names  --  Chris-Craft displayed the Challenger , the Roamer , the Cavalier , and the Commander  --  and on each floor they were all packed so close together that they gave the place the look of a very crowded Long Island harbor that had suddenly been drained . On the day of our visit , the Show was open only to the trade , and quite a few of the visitors , we noticed , were old acquaintances , greeting each other with such questions as " What kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where are you folks staying this year ? " Many people were wearing badges that listed their name and company  --  Toms River Yacht Sails , Eaton Marine , Bardaldand some were doubly identified by blazers that had their company 's name and insignia sewn on the pocket where some people wear college shields . The Queen , Marlene Lieblein , was right on time . She looked both real and live , and very much like one of those healthy young blond girls in California who are always humiliating their elders in swimming races She was wearing a yellow tailored suit , and she had on a badge that said " Queen " in the space for company identification . " Have you ever seen a boat with an electric dishwasher in it ? " we asked the Queen . " Oh , my , no ? " she said . " My father has a fishing station in Southold , Long Island , and I 've worked there every summer since I began high school , but we have mostly runabouts in addition to the outboards we rent out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of New Rochelle now , studying math . The nuns let me come down this week  --  maybe because part of the prize is a **30;2697;TOOLONG scholarship  --  and it 's been just like a dream , but I have to go back for an exam Monday . The sports editor of the .1 ogsmal-iimrrican fishes at out place , and he talked me into entering the contest . I did n't want to -- I thought it would be one of those bathing-suit things -- hut it 's just been great . " As we walked toward the boat that had the electric dishwasher , a man in a green blazer stepped aside and said , " Make way for the Queen . " The Queen smiled . " Hui ) cow ! " said the Queen when we reached the Double Cabin Pacemaker . " Do you think we can just go right on " We reminded her that she was the Queen , and escorted her past a desk where two carefully pretty girls who looked the way we had expected the Queen to look were handing out brochures , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intently explaining the brochure . On the way up the gangplank , we asked the Queen if she could handle a boat herself . " Well , mostly just runabouts , " she said . " Sometimes our people get out in the bay and it gets rough and they 're afraid to come back , So they call from Shelter Island , and we have to go and get them . When they see me coming , they feel like two cents . I deliver boats by water sometimes , and I like to fish for bluefish  --  usuall ) at Plum Gut , between Plum Island and Orient Point . You have to jig for bluefish  --  you know , a jig is a diamond-shaped , silver-colored plug , and you have to reel it in and out  --  and it 's more exciting to jig than to just sit there and wait for a fish to come , " We walked into the pilothouse , which had wall-to-wall carpeting , a built-in bar behind the pilot 's scat , some rattan Furniture , and a coffee table holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entire boat , with extras , could be purchased for $41,567 , F.O.B.

Walking down the fully carpeted stairs , we arrived in a fully carpeted salon , which was decorated with Danish modern furniture , a television set , an air-conditioner , and a coffee table holding a bowl of wax fruit . The salon was color-keyed . " Where 's the electric dishwasher ? " the Queen asked . We walked into the galley  --  which had some wax vegetables on the drawboard  --  reached up to what looked like a wall oven , and pulled it open . There was the electric dishwasher . " Oh , boy ! " the Queen said . " It really does have an electric dishwasher ! " In the master stateroom we found three more visitors , two of them in blazers . " Nicely done , " one of them conceded as he glanced over the fully carpeted , color-keyed room . We noticed a vase of wax Rowers that had a price tag showing it was marked down from $8.98 to $7.20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the way back to the salon , we inspected a roomy closet that contained five orange life jackets and a vacuum cleaner . " What do you think ? " we asked the Queen as we left the Double Cabin Pacemaker . " Well , it 's a nice boat , " she said , smiling toward the man in the Pacemaker blazer . " We 'll take it .
