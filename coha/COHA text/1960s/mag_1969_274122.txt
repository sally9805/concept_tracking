THE MESSAGE OF HISTORY 'S BIGGEST HAPPENING <P> THE baffling history of mankind is full of obvious turning points and significant events : battles won , treaties signed , rulers elected or deposed , and now , seemingly , planets conquered . Equally important are the great groundswells of popular movements that affect the minds and values of a generation or more , not all of which can be neatly tied to a time and place . Looking back upon the America of the ' 60s , future historians may well search for the meaning of one such movement . It drew the public 's notice on the days and nights of Aug. 15 through 17 , 1969 , on the 600-acre farm of Max Yasgur in Bethel , N.Y . <P> What took place at Bethel , ostensibly , was the Woodstock Music and Art Fair , which was billed by its youthful Manhattan promoters as " An Aquarian Exposition " of music and peace .

Thousands more would have come if police had not blocked off access roads , which had become ribbonlike parking lots choked with stalled cars . Had the festival lasted much longer , as many as one million youths might have made the pilgrimage to Bethel . The lure of the festival was an all-star cast of top rock artists , including Janis Joplin , Jimi Hendrix and the Jefferson Airplane . But the good vibrations of good groups turned out to be the least of it . What the youth of America-and their observing elders-saw at Bethel was the potential power of a generation that in countless disturbing ways has rejected the traditional values and goals of the U.S. Thousands of young people , who had previously thought of themselves as part of an isolated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are , as the saying goes , what 's happening . Adults were made more aware than ever before that the children of the welfare state and the atom bomb do indeed march to the beat of a different drummer , as well as to the tune of an electric guitarist . The spontaneous community of youth that was created at Bethel was the stuff of which legends are made ; the substance of the event contains both a revelation and a sobering lesson .
