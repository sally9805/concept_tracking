Gian Carlo Menotti owes a large part of his fame to television and the fact that Amahl has replaced Tiny Tim as America 's favorite Christmas cripple . Though Menotti 's Amahl and the Night Visitors ( 1951 ) , like Maria Golovin ( 1958 ) , was written primarily for television , the composer carefully followed all the conventions of stage presentation , and both works have been sung in theaters . But Menotti has finally gone all the way . His latest opera , Labyrinth , commissioned like the others by NBC and shown for the first time this week , would be impossible on the stage . It is an out-and-out TV show . Says Menotti : " I thought I might as well do something not tied to the stage . I fought it in one way , because I hate machines . But machines like me better than I like them , and I succumbed . " <P> Menotti 's surrender has been almost too complete . Labyrinth is full of video trickery : there is a gravity-free tea party aboard a rocket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meteor ; there is an ancient railroad car used as a swimming pool , which , as its water gurgles down a drain to the accompaniment of some electronic movie music , becomes a high-and-dry day coach ; and there is a dear old lady who puffs into a cloud of dust as the hero sits down on her . <P> Chess &; Counterspies . Labyrinth takes place in a murky sort of mahogany Marienbad . Endless corridors and countless doors make the plight of a bridegroom who has lost his key and forgotten his room number on his wedding night seem hopeless indeed . As he and his bride flounder around with understandable impatience , a series of personages appear , each bearing-according to Menotti-a strong allegorical identity . An old man in a wheelchair , who represents The Past , lures the groom into a cobwebby conservatory filled with jungle plants to play a possibly symbolic game of chess . Another door leads him into a drab office where a horn-rimmed boss-lady screams into a jangle of telephones and thrusts envelopes to a flunky with : " Wrap it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represents The Present , and is far too busy to help . An astronaut , who is The Future , offers a cup of tea but little sympathy : " Your key ? But why look for key or door , with so many stars to explore ? " A mute bellhop prances in and out of doors , leers at the bride , is finally stabbed by a voluptuous lady spy who sings : " He was a counterspy . He had to die ! " <P> Coffins &; Chases . At last , after losing his bride entirely in a series of aquatic misadventures , the bridegroom winds up wet and nearly naked at the desk of the hotel . The hotel manager , in sinister makeup , obviously represents Death . He has a key for the groom all right , the key he has been looking for all his life . The groom is told to lie down on a bench , and a coffin is built around him . When the manager and a lackey finish nailing it together , they carry it away , leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his chest . In one hand is the key .
