THOUGH they may disagree with his policies , foreign diplomats will find it difficult to dislike West Germany 's new Foreign Minister . Affable and engaging , Walter Scheel , who is also the leader of the Free Democratic Party , has the relaxed manner and quick wit of a Rhinelander . An adept mime , he delights in performing creditable imitations of other West German politicians . He loves to tell jokes , often making himself the butt . At a recent ball in West Berlin , for example , he showed up wearing a hand-lettered sign on his lapel that read in English : " Kiss me , I 'm a Liberal . " <P> For all his clowning , Scheel ( pronounced shale ) is tough and talented . " I am not a special friend of pretension , " he said at his swearing-in ceremony last week . Like Brandt , he is truly a self-made man . The son of a wheelwright from the knives-and-scissors town of Solingen , he did not continue his education beyond high school . <P> After wartime service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and two Iron Crosses ) , he worked as a superintendent in a small steel mill . He was elected in 1953 to the Bundestag and served for five years ( 1961-66 ) as West Germany 's Minister for Economic Cooperation , a post that gave him a solid grounding in international affairs . Two years ago , Scheel won control from the conservative faction of the Free Democrats and engineered a radical shift in party policy-from right of the Christian Democrats to left of the Socialists on a number of issues . In foreign affairs , Scheel and Brandt agree on all fundamental points , including the need to retain West Germany 's strong commitment to the West while seeking better relations with the East . Though political infighting provides one of the few diversions in the otherwise small-town atmosphere of Bonn , Scheel has scrupulously refused to be a participant . As a result , he has almost no serious political enemies . " I do not take part in back-stabbing , " he says . " Those who wield the knives usually end up sticking themselves . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in July married an attractive Munich physician who will be a welcome addition to Bonn 's diplomatic whirl . For the easygoing Scheel , however , his new eminence imposes a few regrettable strictures . Not the least of them is that he can no longer wear loud sports jackets or whiz about Bonn in his zippy BMW 2500 sedan ( " the businessman 's sports car " ) . Even a foe of pretension must allow himself to be chauffeured in a stately black Mercedes if he also happens to be West Germany 's Foreign Minister .
