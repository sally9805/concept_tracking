txt ? The three astronauts who will fly on man 's first moon-landing attempt said tonight they were ready to fly , had no fear of the mission and were confident of its success . " After a decade of planning and hard work , " Neil A. Arm-1 strong , the civilian commander ' of Apollo 11 , said , " we 're willing and ready to attempt to achieve our national goal . " Mr. Armstrong said he and his crew , Col. Edwin E. Aldrin Jr . and Lieut . Col. Michael Collins of the Air Force , " really have no fear of launching out on this mission . " Colonel Aldrin told reporters it was all right to use the term " when " and not " if " in referring to the moon landing . " We 're thinking positively , " Colonel Aldrin said . The three Apollo 11 astronauts made these statements in their final public appearance before their scheduled lift-off at 9:32 A.M. , Eastern daylight time , Wednesday , on an eightday voyage to the moon for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Co , lonel ( Aldrin are set to land on the moon Sunday and walk on its surface early Monday morning . The three astronauts appeared on a nationally televised 30-minute interview with four newsmen selected from the 3,000 who are here to cover the launching . Because of the astronauts ' semi-quarantine , they did not appear in the same room with the newsmen . Instead , the interview was conducted over closed-circuit television . The , astronauts , wearing short-sleeved shirts and sitting in soft chairs , were ' in one building and the newsmen were 15 miles away in another . Television cameramen who were allowed in the auditorium with the astronauts underwent thorough medical examinations . Such precautions are being taken to reduce the chances that the three men will catch any mission-delaying illnesses . " Anticipation , " Colonel Aldrin said , is the word that best characterizes their state of mind within 40 hours of launching . Mr. Armstrong appeared slightly nervous choosing his words with laborious care , and Colonel Aldrin was stiff and unsmiling . Only Colonel Collins appeared relaxed . As the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the moon-orbiting command ship while the other astronauts ferry to and from the lunar surface in the landing craft . Colonel Collins said that he would be " tending the store " and would not even have a television set aboard to watch Mr. Armstrong and Colonel Aldrin walk on the moon . " I 'm going to be one of the few Americans who is not going to be able to see the EVA extra-vehicular activity , or moon walking , " Colonel Collins said . Asked if he agreed with earlier estimates that the Apollo 11 crew had an 80 per cent chance of success , Mr. Armstrong replied : " I think that 's a reasonable estimate . " The Apollo commander added , however , that the odds of going to the moon and getting back safely were " far greater than that . " Fear is not " an unknown emotion to us , " Mr. Armstrong said in answer to a related question . But , he said , " we have no fear of launching out on this expedition . " In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , director of the Marshall Space Flight Center at Huntsville , Ala. , said that he had " complete confidence " that the Apollo 11 astronauts would be able to carry out successfully all the steps of their lunar-landing mission . Colonel Aldrin said that the space agency would probably consider the flight a success if he and Mr. Armstrong landed safely on the moon and returned to earth , even without walking outside the bug-shaped landing craft . The two men are supposed to spend 2 hours 40 minutes walking on the soil of the moon 's Sea of Tranquillity , collecting rock and dirt samples to bring back for analysis . The astronauts wished the Soviet Union success in the flight of Luna 15 , whose destination is the moon but whose purpose while in that neighborhood is unknown . Mr. Armstrong said that it was unlikely that Luna 15 , if it went into moon orbit , would interfere with his mission ' . He said the possibilities of encountering the Russian ship around the moon were " infinitesimal . " Mr. Armstrong also cornmented on something that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scheduled to sleep four hours on the moon to be rested for the difficult task of returning from the moon . As the first man on the moon with only a short time-12 hours  --  to stay there , will they sleep during any of that time ? Mr. Armstrong smiled and said , " I 'll be surprised if I 'm able to get sound sleep . " Before their news conference , the Apollo 11 astronauts spent the morning and part of the aftefnoon practicing flight maneuvers in their computerized training vehicles . Mr. Armstrong and Colonel Aldrin worked at the controls of the landing craft simulator , and Colonel Collins practiced in the command ship trainer . Later , the three men limbered up in the gymnasium at their crew quarters here . Launching crews , meanwhile , continued to rest and service the Saturn 5 rocket , the landing craft and the command craft  --  the full 363-foottall " stack " on the launching pad . They reported that preparations were running about an hour ahead of schedule . They pumped super- cold liquid hydrogen and liquid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spacecraft 's electricity during flight . The tanks and fuel cells are in the command ship 's rear - equipment compartment , called the service module . Batteries were installed in the rocket 's three stages and its Instrument unit , the threefoot-high electronic guidance , system that steers the rocket during the 12 minutes between the liftoff and the orbiting of the spacecraft . The pace of the prelaunching preparations , which began last Thursday , will pick up considerably tomorrow when the crews seal off the landing craft , conduct safety checks , run a computerized inspection of all systems in both the rocket and . the spacecraft and begin pumping propellants into the rocket . The astronauts are expected to run through a final review of their flight plan and rehearse some of their more critical maneuvers in the training simulators . The weather outlook for Wednesday morning was reported " satisfactory . " At the liftoff the skies are expected to be clear , with light winds from the northwest and temperatures in the high 80 's .
