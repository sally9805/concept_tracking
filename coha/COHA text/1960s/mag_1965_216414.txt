After Egypt 's Gamal Abdel Nasser nationalized the Suez Canal in 1956 , he advised the Americans to " choke on your fury , " and when John Foster Dulles died three years later , he gleefully ob served : " The worms are now feeding on this rotten old man . " Though he was more restrained about the U.S. during the Kennedy years , the " nonaligned " Nasser is now back in full invective form , as he proved last week in a tympany-tempered speech at Port Said . " Anyone who does not like our atti tude , " he roared , " can drink the sea . And if the Mediterranean is not big enough , we will give him the Red Sea as well . " Nasser 's salty slur - the Arabic equivalent of " jump in the lake " - was aimed at U.S. Ambassador Lucius D. Battle , who had been brazen enough to criti cize Nasser for his recent anti-American posture . Shortly after the U.S. Belgian rescue operation in the Congo , Egyptian mobs burned the $350.000 John F. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrying two U.S. oil-company employees was shot down near Alexandria by Egyptian MIGs . More ominous from Washington 's viewpoint was Nasser 's aid to the Communist-backed Congo rebels . <P> In his " Victory Day " speech ( celebrating the end of the 1956 Suez crisis ) , Nasser cockily confessed to the Congo caper . " We have sent arms to the Congolese rebels , " he boasted , " and we will continue to send arms-because the rebels need the support of all honest nations . " Inferring a U.S. threat to cut off $140 million a year in aid to Egypt ( mostly surplus wheat , corn and frozen chickens ) , Nasser waxed indignant : " We drink tea seven days a week now : we can cut it to five . We eat meat four days ; we can cut it to three . We are people of dignity , and do not accept disdain from anyone . " His own tongue somewhat carried away , Egypt 's strongman vowed to " cut off the tongue " of anyone who voices " words against us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visiting Soviet Troubleshooter Aleksandr Shelepin , Nasser coyly dropped his punch line : " We shall not sell our independence for 30 , 40 or even 50 million pounds . " The price was indubitably high , but Shelepin must have got the message .
