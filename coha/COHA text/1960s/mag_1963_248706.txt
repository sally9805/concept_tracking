Once on a state visit to Paris , Abb Fulbert Youlou , President of the Republic of the Congo , shook hands with Charles de Gaulle and boasted : " Like you , I am irreversible . " Last week , on the third anniversary of his country 's independence , Youlou was reversed right out of office by an explosion of his people 's pent-up discontent . <P> His country , the ex-French colony called the " other Congo " to distinguish it from its anarchic ex-Belgian neighbor , * has long seemed quiet and peaceful . But when it came , Youlou 's exit had all the revolutionary trimmings , including a storming of the local bastille and a mob outside the palace howling for bread . <P> Rise to the Top . Habitually clad in a cassock often topped by a Homburg , and said to have carried a pistol in his robes , Youlou at 46 was one of the world 's most unusual statesmen . A member of the Lari tribe-his name means " fetish which can not be grasped " - he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Later , in defiance of orders from his superior , Youlou ran for the French Assembly ( he lost ) and was suspended by the church , is still forbidden to say Mass . Because of his suspension , he was acclaimed by his countrymen as a victim of discrimination and elected mayor of Brazzaville in 1956 . Exploiting Congolese superstitions , he soon had many voters convinced that his personal fetish , a small yellow crocodile , had " the power . " With the advent of independence , Youlou was elected Premier and President , promising his new nation " tomorrows that sing . " <P> He ordered a Paris couturier to run up a wardrobe of cassocks , in colors from mauve to bottle green . He savored imported champagne by the case and constructed a luxury hotel ; when asked how he financed it , he replied : " I am spending the savings of poor maman . She sold nuts and vegetables . " <P> Rise of the Critics . Meanwhile the country 's timber-based economy stagnated . This year France cut off its $1,100,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices doubled , and as bush people kept streaming into crowded Brazzaville , 19 out of every 20 Africans in the city were without work . Then Youlou made his worst mistake-he asked Guinea 's demagogic , leftish President Skou Tour for a visit . Instead of uttering niceties , the guest electrified the locals with denunciations of African leaders who turn wealthy bourgeois . <P> Last month Brazzaville 's three trade unions , one of which is Communist , demanded reforms . Youlou promised labor a say in a new , single-party government that he planned to proclaim . Satisfied , the unions eased off . But fortnight ago , word began circulating that Youlou was about to renege . Promptly the unions called a general strike ; last week , on the eve of the strike , two labor leaders were arrested .
