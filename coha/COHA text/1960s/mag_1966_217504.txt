Grey-haired , baggy-eyed George P. <P> Mahoney had tried and failed six times since 1950 to win Maryland 's governor ship or a U.S. Senate seat . When the wealthy Baltimore contractor once again entered the gubernatorial primary race this year , few Marylanders took him seriously . This time , however , Mahoney , 64 , was canny enough to concentrate his campaign on a single issue touching the pocketbooks and emotions of many voters : the possibility of a state law ban ning racial discrimination in the sale and rental of housing . <P> Mahoney thus bid unabashedly for the anti-integration elements that gave Alabama 's racist Governor George Wal lace an astonishing 42.7% of the popular vote when he ran for Maryland 's 1964 presidential nomination . Mahoney exploited white apprehensions stirred by black-power demonstrations in Baltimore last summer , capitalized as well on congressional resistance to the open-housing clause of the President 's 1966 civil rights bill . His slogan : " Your Home Is Your Castle-Protect It ! " <P> <P> Even so , Mahoney 's biggest assist came from his opponents . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 100% A.D.A . rating on major issues , was the early favorite to win the nomination . As an ardent advocate of the strongest possible federal open-housing plan , he promised that if Congress failed to pass a tough bill , he would see to it that an unequivocal open-housing code was adopted by the Maryland legislature . State Attorney General Thomas B. Finan , 52 , a member of the scandal-tainted administration of outgoing Governor J. Millard Tawes , also supported open-housing legislation . <P> The election was close and might depend on the counting of absentee ballots for its final outcome . At week 's end , <P> George Mahoney had 146,152 votes , Sickles 145,118 and Finan 133,149 ; a ragged field of five other candidates had 62,000 among them . If Mahoney wins , it would have to be called a startling upset , but it would by no means be the " backlash victory " that much of the daily press instantly called it . The fact was , Mahoney attracted a bare 31% of all votes cast ; his two major opponents , both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws , pulled nearly twice that much . <P> <P> Mahoney 's win , in the long run , would be a serious loss for his party . The bitterly fought contest so severely splintered Maryland Democrats that even token unity would be hard to reconstruct in the foreseeable future . The real winner in all likelihood would thus be the Republican candidate for Governor , Spiro T. Agnew , 47 , an even-tempered moderate who has served ably as Baltimore County Executive . Agnew is now a heavy favorite to win in November .
