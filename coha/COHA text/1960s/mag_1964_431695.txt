 | Even with the increased use of vaccines , the U.S. has experienced five flu epidemics since 1957 . Why ? At first , the conflict was as disquieting as a scream in the night . In a barrage of page-one headlines last fall , the value of flu shots ? heretofore accepted as reflexively as blinking ? was repeatedly challenged . Six years after flu shots had first been widely used in the United States , an official of the U.S. Public Health Service asserted that the results of tests with the 1963 influenza vaccine were " disappointing " and that the widespread use of flu shots " can not be justified . " It was a little like questioning the value of virtue . Since the great Asian-flu scare of 1957 , the United States has suffered through five influenza epidemics . They flourished despite increasing use of flu vaccine . Three of these epidemics were severe ones , costing the lives of an estimated 88,000 people . The onslaught of the last one , in 1963 , was predicted eight months in advance . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccine ? almost as many as during the 1957 epidemic ? were distributed . Yet the 1963 flu epidemic stands as the most severe flu epidemic ? except for 1957 ? in a generation . If flu shots are so effective why do we have so many flu epidemics ? And why was the last epidemic so severe ? These , in effect , were the points raised last November at a meeting of the American Public Health Association by Dr. Alexander D. Langmuir of the U.S. Public Health Service , one of the towering figures of modern epidemiology . The answers were lost in the glowing heat of controversy , and the public was left . in confusion and in doubt . The very violence of the controversy clouded these facts : ? Flu shots do not guarantee immunity from the illness . They never have . The current dispute is over just how much immunity they do offer . Dr. Langmuir says certain tests indicate that flu shots were only 20 to 25 percent effective in the 1963 epidemic ? that is , that only 20 to 25 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the illness . Other voices in flu research , just as authoritative , insist that flu shots are , on the average , 79 percent effective against Asian flu . Dr. Langmuir agrees that flu vaccine which was used before 1963  | appeared to be 70 to 75 percent effective . ? No other form of protection against flu is available . " The alternative to taking flu shots , " says Dr. Fred M. Davenport of the University of Michigan , " is to do nothing . " ? All sides agree that , in the face of a threatened epidemic , " high risks " should take flu shots . " High risks " are those persons whose lives are most likely to be threatened by the flu ? pregnant women , the aged , people with lung or heart or circulatory ailments and those with such chronic illnesses as asthma , diabetes and Addison 's disease . " Next winter , " says Dr. Langmuir , " there is a 50 percent chance we will have an influenza epidemic . " To decide whether or not to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later than September ) , the individual should consider the background as well as the battleground of flu research . The word " flu " comes , of course , from " influenza , " which stems , in turn , from an Italian phrase , un influenza di freddo , meaning " the influence of cold . " ( An earlier name for the flu , the grippe , appears to have come from a French word , agripper , meaning " to attack . " ) Influenza has had a long and lethal history . Hippocrates wrote of a flu epidemic in the fifth century B.C. Oliver Cromwell , Lord Protector of England , reportedly died of the flu in 1658 ? in late summer , by the way . The various world epidemics ? called pandemics ? have taken more lives than many of history 's most destructive wars . The flu epidemic of 1918 , for instance , killed ten times as many Americans as were killed in battle in World War I , and the death toll all around the world totaled more than 21 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by all sides during the entire four years of World War I. NOT until 1933 was the specific cause of influenza discovered . Then it was identified as a virus so small that 25 million of them could fit on the head of a pin . This virus was called Type A , and its discovery made possible the development of a vaccine to prevent the then-most-virulent strain of influenza . The first general use of such a vaccine came in 1943 , when members of the U.S. Army 's college-training program ( ASTP ) were inoculated against the threat of the severe influenza A epidemic of 1943-44 . However , widespread civilian use of the vaccine was not to follow for several years ? years in which a number of difficulties were to arise . By 1953 , three more types of flu virus ? B , C and D ? had been discovered , each of them distinctly different from the others . " They were n't even first cousins , " says Dr. Davenport . Theoretically , this meant that four different vaccines would be needed to combat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two types , Virus A and Virus B , appear to cause epidemics ; Types C and D rarely seem to cause much trouble . And science has found a way to combine Types A and B in the same vaccine so that the standard treatment ? two flu shots taken two months apart ? offers some protection against epidemics touched off by either the Type A or Type B virus . New complications continued to arise as our understanding of the flu family deepened . In 1947 , a new strain of Type A virus suddenly appeared . It was called A-Prime , and it started a brisk epidemic that year . A most disturbing fact was that none of the flu vaccines then in use had any effect on APrime ; they had been designed to combat the original Type A. Vaccine to fight Type A-Prime could be ? and was ? produced , of course , but that was hardly the end of the problem . For the abrupt appearance of one new strain of a virus suggested that others might eventually appear . And strain after strain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes into a laundry bag . Even if a vaccine could be developed to combat each specific new strain , some method of spotting the latter had to be set up so that there would be time to produce enough vaccine to combat the epidemic the newcomer threatened to start . As it happens , the World Health Organization , an arm of the United Nations , was already helping to maintain a number of " watch laboratories " all around the world to spot the development of new influenza strains . It was this system which helped give us the alert on the sudden development of the next new strain of Type A virus ? Asian flu . On April 17 , 1957 , a WHO watch laboratory reported the new and virulent strain at work in Hong Kong . The virus had gotten a hold in Kweichow province in southwest China two months earlier ( hence " Asian " flu ) , and the epidemic it was causing was the worst in a generation . Up to then , there had been little civilian use of influenza vaccine in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Service decided to launch for the first time a crash program to persuade the American public to be inoculated against Asian flu . It was a race against time ? an effort to get enough vaccine into enough people before the epidemic struck here . Armed with a $110,000 appropriation from Congress , the USPHS mobilized the propaganda resources of the nation . Such personalities as Dave Garroway , Edward R. Murrow and John Daly were recruited to warn on TV of the flu threat . Magazines , newspapers , radio , the American Red Cross , the Advertising Council , as well as the USPHS itself , flooded the country with information . By September 23 , 1957 , a Gallup poll found that 92 percent of the adults questioned had heard of Asian flu ; 76 percent knew there was a vaccine to prevent the disease ; 65 percent planned to be vaccinated . There was only one drawback : There was n't enough vaccine to go around . Before April of that year , the various drug companies had not even heard of the new strain of Type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the epidemic reached its peak ? they had produced and distributed about 12 million doses @# of a new vaccine aimed specifically at combating Asian flu . It was an impressive performance ? but it was n't good enough . Demand for the vaccine far outran supply , and many doctors faced the painful task of deciding which of their patients ? the truly ill , the merely fearful , the rich , the poor , the young , the old ? should get flu shots . ( Some doctors solved the problem by cutting doses in half or even in tenths to spread the supply further , but this only cut down the chance that the vaccine would do allyone any good . ) In many corporations and institutions , flu shots became a matter of status ? Presidents got their shots before vice-presidents , and personal secretaries before stenographers . In Washington , a tense little contretemps developed when the FBI discovered that Allen Dulles , chief of the CIA , had received his flu shots long before J. Edgar Hoover , director of the FBI , was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a profound lesson in the power of propaganda . And in spite of it all , we lost the race . The virus was first discovered in the U.S. in June , apparently carried here by U.S. naval personnel returning from the Far East . By September , a fullscale epidemic had gathered force . By mid-October , it reached its peak . Altogether , some 80 million Americans spent one or more days in bed from " colds " ( many of which , doctors think , were actually cases of Asian flu ) , and some 62,000 persons died because of the flu or the ailments it complicated ? more than in any other year since 1933 . Does this mean the flu vaccine failed ? NOT necessarily . Almost all authorities ? including the critical Dr. Langmuir ? agree that the epidemic achieved full fury because the vaccine was developed too late to permit mass inoculations . Maximum production of the vaccine came after the epidemic had reached its peak . " Things might have been different if we 'd had even one more month of lead time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wherever the vaccine was used in time ? from the Soviet Union to the Prudential Insurance Company ? it was thought useful , particularly in preventing absenteeism on jobs . One medical journal reported that a large company which did not inoculate its employees suffered a 102 percent increase in absenteeism during the peak epidemic month in 1957 , while the Prudential ? which inoculated all of its employees in time ? experienced an increase of only 65 percent . If that was a comfort , it was also a warning . For it was clear that not even wise and timely use of the vaccine offered full immunity . Yet it was not until six years later that the value of the vaccine was seriously questioned . To understand the controversy that followed , it is useful to break the whole matter down to a few important elements , and to contrast the position on these of Dr. Langmuir , who questions the vaccine , with that of Dr. Davenport who defends it .  | THE MATTER OF DEATHS The charge : Dr. Langmuir points out that some 28 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that another 42 million were distributed before the 1963 epidemic . Yet , in 1963 , a startlingly high total of 57,000 persons died from ailments caused or complicated by the flu . The rebuttal : Dr. Davenport states that only a small fraction of the 1963 vaccine went to persons over 65 . He estimates that " 84 percent of persons prone to die during an epidemic of influenza were left unprotected . " An independent appraisal : No one really knows how many people received an adequate dosage of flu vaccine in 1963 . Patients receiving flu shots for the first time should take two doses of vaccine ; those who have been inoculated within the last year need only a single " booster " shot . Thus , the number of people receiving the 42 million doses of vaccine distributed in 1963 may have varied anywhere from 21 million to more than 42 million , since some doctors divided their supply into smallerthan-recommended doses to make it gc further . Moreover , there is no sure way of knowing how many of those who received shots , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how many of these , who died , were actually killeu by the flu . EFFICACY OF THE VACCINE The charge : Dr. Langmuir , citing " limited studies " of the efficacy of influenza vaccine during the 1963 epidemic , says , " The findings are disappointing and point to an efficacy of not greater than 20 to 25 percent at best . For this reason , widespread use of influenza vaccines can not be justified . " The rebuttal : Dr. Davenport offers evidence that protection against Asiar flu has averaged 79 percent since 1957. and that protection against earlier strains of Type A virus averaged from . 72 to 78 percent . These figures are the product of some nineteen years of study on how the vaccine worked among members of the U.S. Armed Forces . " While the partially-vaccinated civilian population was heavily afflicted during the epidemics of 1960-62 and of 1962-63 , " says Dr. Davenport , " there was no parallel experience among the uniformlyvaccinated military in either year . " An independent appraisal : Dr. Langmuir 's figures appear to be based on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtually ideal conditions . ( The military offers a well-controlled environment for preventing influenza ? once the recruits are vaccinated ? since the youths get regular hours of sleep . a nutritious diet , and plenty of exercise . ) Neither set of figures tells us much about how the vaccine acted under the less-than-ideal conditions faced by the general civilian population . Are there any figures based on these conditions ? The answer is no . The key is to determine how many civilians received the proper two doses of vaccine ,  | how many of these were exposed to influenza , and how many fell ill with influenza ? then compare their experiences with those of all the people who were not vaccinated . Since that key is missing , all claims as to the over-all effectiveness of influenza vaccine are merely well-informed guesses . CHANGE IN STRAINS The charge : Dr. Langmuir asserts that the strain of Asian flu active in the 1963 epidemic was somewhat different from that of the original Asian-flu virus of 1957 ? yet the vaccine used to combat it was not altered to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been one cause of the severity of the 1963 epidemic . Until then , he says , the vaccine had appeared to be 70 to 75 percent effective . The rebuttal : Dr. Davenport points out that the shift in the flu strain was carefully reviewed by the Surgeon General 's Advisory Committee on Influenza , whose decision was that the " degree of shifting did not warrant a crash program to develop a new vaccine for 1962-63 , even though a large outbreak was anticipated . " Dr. Langmuir himself was influential in helping the Advisory Committee reach its decision . An independent appraisal : The key seems to be to " tailor " the vaccine to combat the strain of virus that is likely to cause the next epidemic , not the strain that caused the last one . As a matter of fact , the vaccine now available does include protection against the latest changes in the Asian-flu strain . But it also includes protection against a number of strains that caused past epidemics . Dr. Langmuir and his associates suggest that the vaccine be designed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cause the next epidemic , and that it be " tailored , " from year to year if necessary , to achieve this . This would take skilled prediction of changes in flu-virus strains and , perhaps , better research than is available now . Prediction of a change in flu-virus strains is not impossible . Each of the virus types has a regular cycle . Type A ( now the Asian-flu strain ) virus appears every two to three years . Type B virus appears every four to six years . But when a totally new and virulent strain of a particular virus is about to appear , the cycle is interrupted , and a beguiling calm occurs in which there are no epidemics due to the original virus . These periods of calm are called " salubrious " periods . When they appear , we know something fearful is about to happen . Unfortunately , we have only a very short time to make an assessment of an approaching assault in order to prepare a vaccine against it . The current approach in flu research is less toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than toward developing an all-round vaccine ? a vaccine " cocktail " that would help check a number of virus-caused diseases . In addition , some progress is being made toward developing vaccines that are more acceptable to patients and less costly . One advance was revealed only last January : A new method of treating the virus produced a vaccine that does not , like previous vaccines , induce a high fever in inoculated children . What is the truth about flu shots " Out of all the controversy a few facts emerge . One is that flu shots offer n certain protection against the illness The other is that neither have they beer . proved virtually useless . If these conclusions offer only small comfort , there is reassurance in the fact that the controversy itself has sparked an intensified and more critical inquiry into current methods of fighting influenza . From this inquiry it can be hoped that new and more effective approaches will be devised .
