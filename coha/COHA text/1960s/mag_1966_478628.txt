S.L.A , Marshall , retired Brigadier General and outstanding military historian , was in the Vietnam combat zone for two months ? it was his third trip . " There is no way to tell about battle , " he writes , " except to deal with the men at the time . " He went to Hereford Landing Zone shortly before these events took place . " Later I returned to it , " he writes . " Nothing untoward happened . That is the way luck runs in war : everything broke wrong for Castan in his short time . At least he got up there , which can be said of too few correspondents in Vietnam . " This is the first of a series of reports by Marshall from Vietnam . He is the author of The River and the Gauntlet , Pork Chop Hill , and many other books . The battle known by the code name of Crazy Horse was fought in May over a battleground about twenty miles square , running east from the Vinh Thanh Valley . This area , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war , stretches over one of the loftiest ranges in the Central Highlands , and had long been uncontested Vietcong country . The battle began when a large part of the First Cavalry Division moved out of its fortified base at Ankhe on a sweep to the northeast . After seven days of fighting through the jungle-covered mountains , it had broken up the main Vietcong units in the Vinh Thanh Valley ; and by the night of May 20 the enemy seemed to be running for cover everywhere . Landing Zone Hereford looked at that time like one of the safest places in the whole battle area . It was a patch of sloping ground , on the edge of a long ridge , where the American helicopters had made one of their first landings at the opening of the offensive . Armed traffic had been moving in and out of it ever since , without any real hindrance , so it now seemed an unlikely target for a Vietcong attack . That was about how Colonel John J. Hennessey thought of it when he decided on a special mission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the following morning . It was a courteous gesture , the main object being to return Charley Company to its parent battalion . But for so doing , Hennessey planned to ask a small favor in return . The company , under Captain Don F. Warren , a taciturn Georgian who had been with this same unit since winning his gold bars in 1961 , was in perimeter on Hill 766 , several ridges beyond Hereford . The airline distance was about 3,000 meters . Hennessey directed Warren to sweep back over the high ground to Hereford after sunup . Unworried about that passage , Hennessey was most concerned that Charley Company should reconnoiter the lower slopes beyond the landing zone which thus far no one had prowled . That task done , it could rejoin its battalion in the valley about 4,000 meters away . Hennessey had no reason to be suspicious ; he was merely being cautious . The ground around Hereford had not been worked over carefully for several days . Captain Cummings and his Alpha Company were in perimeter on the binding zone . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and grenades that innocuously bit into their ground were attributed to enemy stragglers . Alpha Company was needed back at the Ankhe base camp to man the defensive barrier and would be lifted from Hereford Landing Zone by helicopter as soon as Charley Company appeared . Word of what was afoot reached Major Charles Suter , the division 's Public Information Officer , at Ankhe shortly after Hennessey gave his order . He was then entertaining a visitor and weighing a problem all his own . Belatedly drawn by the news that Operation Crazy Horse was racking up a score , War Correspondent Sam Castan , a thirtyone-year-old Senior Editor of Look Magazine , had just arrived in camp , pursuing a theme worthy of the late Hemingway . He said to Siler , " I wish to know the thoughts of men facing death . " Siler voiced an honest doubt that the quest was logical , men 's fears and reflections not being all of one kind , and the soldier hardly knowing how he thinks of death until he feels he is dying . It is just not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combat men . At that time , General Jack Norton had put the Ankhe position on a semi-alert , and the whole camp was astir . Siler and his staff were in the bunkers around the press camp , realigning some of the sandbags , " You do n't have to worry about this ground 49 tonight , " said Castan . " I 'm the luckiest reporter alive . Where I go , nothing happens . " Slier remembered the words , thinking them slightly ironic in view of what Castan sought . " There 's a big hill not far from here where a lot of men have died in the last few days , " he said . " Then I want to get up there first thing in the morning , " said Castan , " and by the way , 1 intend to follow the subject all the way through ? see the coffins in which you place the bodies . " " We put them in rubber bags , " said Slier glumly , hoping to close the conversation . But Castan continued to fret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broke off work to arrange his certain departure . These were the circumstances which resulted in Castan 's being delivered to Hereford by the same helicopter that carried ammunition , coffee , and a hot breakfast to Cummings and Alpha Company . His first hours were unrewarding , that unit being too busy stacking supply and equipment for an early getaway to talk about death . Besides , the morning was disarmingly fair and quiet . Warren and Charley Company meanwhile were beating along the ridge crest on the way back from Hill 766 , having broken camp at 10:00 A.M. A fairly wide trail runs along the top of the scarp for the entire distance , which made the passage relatively rapid . It would have been faster had not Warren directed that the column would reconnoiter the whole way . The point fired at every bend or covert where the enemy might wait in ambush . But it stirred up nothing and the column heard not an answering shot . Alpha Company was lifted from Hereford when Charley Company arrived at high noon . Castan stayed on . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P. Beard , Jr. , the Battalion Commander , and his Operations Officer , Major William Roll . It was arranged that Warren and the main body of the company would continue their stroll downslope , through the trees and across the river . The mortar platoon would remain on Hereford to cover the company 's further advance with the fire from the one 81-mm tube . The platoon , twenty-two strong , was led by Sergeant Robert L. Kirby , a twenty-nine-year-old Negro from Los Angeles . Slight of frame , solemn-faced , Kirby is rated one of the stoutest-hearted fighters in his brigade . Few in numbers , his men seemed sufficiently armed . Each carried three hundred or more rounds for his M-16 rifle and from two to four hand grenades . The one heavy weapon was the 81-mm mortar for which Kirby had only eighteen rounds ; that , with the tube , was as much weight as the SIGMAN.WAhr men could carry . Moreover , it had been agreed that as soon as the descending company had passed beyond range the platoon would be lifted out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of moving with the company column . It will happen here , if anywhere , " he said to Kirby . " About that , " said Kirby , " you 're dead wrong . " And he honestly felt that way , though as he looked about , what he saw of his position hardly warranted such assurance . It was all wrong from any reasoned tactical view . Beautiful , but Not Good Landing Zone Hereford was by then a horned-off , trampled , and rubble-strewn clearing about double the size of a professional basketball court , running lengthwise down the edge of the ridge . Its scorched earth and grasses were less obtrusive than the foxholes , distributed more or less evenly around the oval-shaped perimeter . Originally they had been enemy spiderholes and were subsequently enlarged by American occupancy . 50 MEN FACING DEATH The trouble was that Kirby did not have enough men to station all the way around this holding . So the position became a " U " with the open , unmanned end upslope . This end fronting toward the high ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ platoon was sighting its rifles down-slope ; the company had gone that way and the platoon was seeking mainly to cover them . In neither direction was the prospect good , if a fight was to be forthcoming , though there was beauty everywhere to soothe the eye . Upslope and at the very edge of the defended ground was a sea of elephant grass standing six to eight feet high . Downhill there was a sheer and rocky precipice extending thirty feet and giving way to an extension of the field of tall grasses , which also invested the flanks . Greenness was all about except where men looked to their weapons . The company took off down the steep hill , clutching at the rocks and creepers for balance . No preparatory artillery fire or air strikes had been put on the slopes around Hereford , because of Warren 's movement , the earlier presence of Alpha Company , and the all-around feeling that the Crazy Horse operation was slowing to a halt . Kirby worried less about his platoon than about the movements and enterprise of Castan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving from position to position standing erect , taking photographs , and asking questions . Wanting to protect Castan , Kirby did not know how to object , though he realized that his movements would disclose the limitations of the force to any enemy who might be watching . Castan was enjoying himself hugely . He asked Kirby , " How do you feel about things ? " Kirby answered , " If you think you 're going to get a story out of this platoon , you 're wrong . Nothing will happen here . " Castan continued with his rounds of the perimeter , snapping pictures , and asking the men , " How do you fee ? " Kirby lost interest and Castan kept moving . The position of the mortar was near the bottom of the sloped landing zone just inside the " U " where its crew had dug a fairly large pit . At approximately 1:00 P.M. the platoon began supporting the descending company with the fire of the 81-mm mortar ? range 800 meters . It takes a while to hack through jungle growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to " bring it in closer , " which Kirby tried to do . One hour later Warren called Kirby again . This time the message was an uplift . Said Warren , " Choppers are coming in to take you out within thirty minutes . " That was what Warren and Kirby thought . But the choppers had put dawn at Landing Zone Savoy , Hennessey 's Command Post in the valley , just to make certain that the orders still stood . Of their delay , wholly unfaultable , came the denouement ? rocking Jack Norton , rocking the High Command , rocking us all . Kirby got off his seventeenth round in support of the advancing company , the last one he was able to fire . Then the thing happened . There was no advance warning . Sergeant Louis Buckley and Private First Class Wade Taste were still collecting the company water cans and other material for the flight to the valley , moving carelessly in the open , even as was Correspondent Castan . The other men , including Kirby , stayed put in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their alertness than of their conforming to operational routine . Once lodged in the position , they had not moved to scout its surroundings . The long trek via the jungle trail had half-bushed them . Over much of the distance they had had to move crouching , because of the viny overhang . There was no shade where they sprawled , the sun beat down directly , and the heat was not less than 100 . The word passed round from hole to hole that they were returning to home base . Nothing much else , not even the eccentric movements and questions of Castan , interested them . The hour must have been about 2:30 . From up-slope , and not more than fifty yards away , came the fire of a heavy machine gun . Its bullet stream was dead on the mortar , the first round ripping through the tube as if the weapon were already zeroed in . Thereafter it sprayed on the mortar pit with never a pause . Such was Kirby 's first warning that he was engaged . He yelled out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not know it , a split-second before Kirby reacted , his own men had started the fight . On the left of the inverted " U " ( it would have been the right flank had these men been facing uphill whence the fire was coming ) Specialists Fourth Class Paul J. Harrison and Charles Stuckey had seen three enemy skirmishers moving in through the elephant grass not five meters beyond their foxholes . Their M-16 fire signaled detection of the movement , to which the machine gun instantly responded . Then , from out the elephant grass , on three sides of the perimeter , rifle fire crackled , and Kirby sensed that his position was enveloped . There was no time to reflect on that . He yelled to his radio man , Spec 4 John F. Spranza , " Call the company . Get them back . We 're being hit . " As the message was relayed to Captain Warren , and as he remembered it , the words were : " Come back , we 're being hit . " Though the main body , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sounds of the fight , Warren had his moment of agonized shock . He knew Kirby as a thoroughly brave soldier , too steady , too seasoned , to be stampeded by a little random fire . When he called for help , the thing had to be fully desperate . Wasting not an instant , Warren called back on radio to Lieutenant Hubert McClellan of First Platoon bringing up the rear of the far-stretched column , " Get your ass back up that hill ! " All hands reversed and went scrambling upward , men clutching at rocks , tearing their palms on the thorned vines , sliding , falling , and panting in a desperate effort to race up the steep . There was no attempt to observe security and , had they been moving into ambush , the disaster could have been greater , Far above them , on the slope of Hereford , men who could still move crouched low to escape the sheet of fire heating from all sides . Most of Kirby 's men had died in the first ten minutes , though he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steadily fainter . The Pit and the Slope Sergeant Isaac Johnson , a twenty-seven-yearold Negro , had been sitting with a plat board at the mortar pit when the fight began . He heard someone yell , " They 're coming out of the woods ! " In his agitation , he tried to turn the mortar around to fire it uphill , not even noticing that it had been drilled through . The incoming fire was too great , his strength too little . So he slithered on his belly to the left flank and dropped into a foxhole , Upslope he could see forty to fifty men coming at a run out of the trees and into the elephant grass , where they were lost to sight . They were partly camouflaged and their shirts were of all colors . Looking downhill he saw as many more enemy , moving through the grass , some crawling , others hunched over , all firing as they moved in . It came to him as a sudden idea that he should fire , too . He thought he dropped at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foxhole , Pfcs Henry Benton and Joe L. Tamayo were alternately firing upslope and downhill , yelling as they pulled trigger . Johnson saw his last of them when he ran out of ammunition and crawled back to the mortar pit in search of a magazine . Inside the pit were four men , heads down . The machine gun and at least two automatic rifles were bearing directly on the hole and smashing its rim . Sergeant Paul Buckloo , twenty-two years in the Army , was having his first go in combat . That opening fusillade cracked him wide open . He bolted straight across the perimeter , vanished into the elephant grass , and was never seen again . Sergeant Johnson could n't find his spare magazine but picked up an M-/6 with fifteen rounds in it from the dead hand of Sergeant Edward Shepherd , who had no business being there that afternoon . Though he ranked Kirby and might have taken command , he was overdue to be lifted out by chopper for an appearance before a promotion board . So he passed up the honor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another long-time Regular Army soldier under fire for the first time , he had stayed motionless , petrified by the horror exploding all about him . His fifteen bullets gone , Johnson crawled toward the mortar pit screaming , " Come on out ! You 'll all be killed . " There was no response ; it was minutes too late for that . The hole held four corpses , heads bashed in by bullet fire . In the nearby hole with Kirby was another bloody welter . A rocket ? the Russian-made P-40 , a round so slow of motion that the eye easily follows the trajectory ? came arcing in , dead center on the mark . Kirby saw it in flight and yelled , " Watch out ! " So did his foxhole mates , Specs 4 Austin L. Drummond and David S. Crocker , who cried warning in the same split second . Before any man could move , the rocket exploded just to left of the hole . Crocker died instantly from a shard that crushed his skull in . Drummond took heavy fragments in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spouted from him that Kirby , who had taken four pieces of steel in his head but was conscious , knew that he could not last long . 52 MEN FACING DEATH In physical torment , Drummond tried to rise . Kirby pulled at him . Drummond screamed , " Let me go . I 'm hurting , hurting . " Kirby pulled him down . Within a minute he died , under Kirby 's body . Blood from Kirby 's pate was streaming into his eyes , but the little sergeant could still see and think . He yelled to his radio telephone operator , Spranza , " Call company . Say I 'm being hit by mortars and rockets . We got ta have gunships and artillery . " Spranza did his part . Captain Warren , struggling upward , remembered this piece of the message coming in : " We 're hit by rockets and mortars . " Later he could not recall that Spranza had also asked for gunfire and the air artillery . But anyhow , he relayed that message to the Command Post at Landing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him : " It 's on the way . " Those were the final words . Right then communication between company and platoon ended , probably because an intervening hill blocked the radio waves . At that moment , the front men in Warren 's column were halfway back to Hereford . The break-off doubled Warren 's anxiety , but he was already doing everything possible . He had asked that the artillery be placed on the slopes alongside the perimeter , not on Hereford itself , for Kirby had passed on nothing about casualties , and Warren was still thinking of twenty-two live men holding the contested ground . The double-time climb had begun to slow from sheer exhaustion . Men stumbled , dropped in their tracks , were pulled to their feet by their mates , and reeled upward again . Warren realized now that if he continued the pressure , the company would reach the scene of the fight dead-beat . About that he no longer gave a damn . From the Helicopter 's Orbit Though the sounds of the struggle had not carried to Savoy in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partly owing to Warren 's call for help , still more because of the monitoring of conversations between eyewitnesses who were viewing the fight from helicopters directly overhead . What they saw and said in no way lessened the confusion . Colonel Beard , the Battalion Commander ; Major Roll , his Operations Officer ; and Captain Robert Offer , artillery liaison , were at the Brigade Command Post when the news came in . They took off in a Huey to view the fight from above . Before they could reach the scene , through sheer happenstance , Major Otto Cantrell , Battalion Executive of the First Battalion , Twelfth Cavalry , was already hovering above it . He had been flying from Ankhe in an H-13 and had arrived opposite the peak when he heard Warren 's voice in his earphone saying that a platoon was being overrun on Hereford . So he flew to station directly above it and began orbiting . Low enough to see people milling around and firing on the ground below him , he was yet too high to determine whether they were friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observer in another II-13 ( one of the little bubble jobs ) , had flown the same way and was circling near Cantrell . He asked Cantrell , " Sir , can I bring in fire ? " Cantrell replied , " No , I ca n't tell where our people are . " Cantrell then flew lower , and at about that time , Beard and his party arrived . They could see forty or more men pressing close to the perimeter . " They must be VC , " called Beard . " Either that , " replied Cantrell , " or GIs with uniforms soaking wet . " His words merely aggravated doubt . Cantrell 's trouble was that he simply could not make himself believe one whole American platoon had been wiped out . He dropped to 100 feet for one swift pass . The phenomena of those few seconds doubled his perplexity . On the ridge crest above Hereford he saw a company of men in dark suits , marching to the fire fight . Shellfire was breaking into the landing zone . Cantrell had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not American rounds incoming from the bases at Savoy and Cobra . The dark-suited men upslope he identified as enemy ; he knew that camouflage rig , which from a distance made them " look like so many turtles . " But where were the Americans , if not on Hereford ? Just then he heard a friendly voice on his FM radio " Please , please hurry . You must hurry . " It was Spranza getting off his last message , but Cantrell had no way of knowing that , either . Beard , viewing from the same height , was for the moment equally in the dark . In the Elephant Grass From the start of the fight , with good reason , Kirby had forgotten Casten the correspondent . He remembered only when Castan slid into his position to ask , " When are we going to get the hell out of here ? " Kirby did n't answer . Then Castan said , " I 've got to have a weapon , " and Kirby silently handed him his own .357 Magnum pistol . Quiet now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shepherd is dead . " All curiosity about the thoughts of men facing death was gone from Castan . He had been eagerly questioning Shepherd when the first shots were fired . That soldier 's sudden death was his first shock contact with the realities which mocked his quest . While his opening question to Kirby rankled , it also rang a bell . Almost anywhere seemed better than the exposed ground to which the survivors clutched , now under a dust pall kicked up by the grazing fire . The fight had been going somewhere between twenty and twenty-five minutes , and the fire was fast becoming wholly one-sided . Next to Kirby 's position the enemy skirmishers crawling through the elephant grass were not more than fifteen feet away ; the fire buildup showed they were bunching , probably for a rush . Kirby saw them fleetingly and vaguely , as through a haze , the flash of an arm , the bobbing of a head . Kirby got off three hand grenades in that direction as rapidly as he could throw . The explosions seemed to damp the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In his moment of decision , Kirby did not doubt that the ring had been closed and that other skirmishers waited on the lower slope amid the elephant grass , between him and the company , poised for the kill . Still , he yelled out , " Let 's make it ! " With that he rolled out of the hole and down the slope . Castan had jumped just ahead of him and was running upright and in the clear . Pfc Taste and Spec 4 A. V. Spikes , from the foxhole above Kirby , went past Kirby , one rolling , the other sprinting . Then Spranza dashed by him . As he rolled , Kirby thought he glimpsed Isaac Johnson off to his left firing two M-16s . He was wrong about that . Johnson had heard someone , not quite echoing Kirby , shout , " Move down the hilt " ' His own weapon was empty . He paused briefly to pick up another , only to find it in like condition . Kirby had seen him in that fleeting second when he clutched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's face was already a bloody mask from three superficial grenade wounds . Such was his tension , he neither heard the blast nor knew he had been hurt . Now in panic because he was unarmed , he made a running dive at the rocky embankment giving off from Hereford 's lower side . Then he rolled on and on downslope till his body could take no more beating . In that spinning descent he covered about 150 meters of rock-strewn trail . When he stopped , a twisting , V-shaped cleft in the ridge back gave off to the left . Along this slit trickled a stream not wider than the palm of Johnson 's hand . He crawled into the bed twenty yards or so , where jungle growth stopped him . There he gathered the bushes and vines down around him and lay with his face flat in the water . Not too far above him the ordeal of the other few survivors continued and grew worse . Of this , Johnson felt and remembered nothing ; thought paralyzed by the grip of exhaustion , he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some running , others rolling , they had stayed that way during the first few yards of flight through the short grass just off the landing zone . Coming to the rocky steep , they began to converge toward center , whence the trail ran downhill . It is always so with men against fire ; fear and herd instinct brings them together , the one worst thing that can happen , since it shapes up a broad target . Spranza was the first to get it as they approached the steep , Kirby still rolling , others crawling . Castan standing . " l 'm hit ! " Spranza yelled , and screamed like a panther . Three bullets , one in each leg , one in the head . But marvelously , he still lived , and now he was erect and walking , Castan yelled back , " Hell , everybody 's hit ! " That was news to the others . Castan had taken a bullet in one arm and several grenade frags in his back , saying nothing . In his last moments the correspondent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm hit ! " It was a bullet through the right arm . They had moved about twenty feet down the rock bank when Spranza yelled again , " Hold it up ! They 're in front of us . " Expecting that , Kirby froze right where he was . Castan kept moving in long strides straight to the trail which led downhill through the elephant grass . He had made up his mind and Kirby did not bother to shout warning . Standing clear on the trail was an enemy soldier , rifle aimed . Kirby heard a scream as Castan went down . Though Castan was not fifteen yards from him , Kirby could not see the fail , as the body was enveloped by the sea of grass . But he heard the thump of the body . The bullet had drilled Castan through his left temple . 54 MEN FACING DEATH Castan 's personal effects were looted soon after he fell . The camera and purse were later recovered from the bodies of enemy dead in a fight that soon followed . Many next-of-kin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an agonizing matter for command ? having to explain why the dead soldier 's most prized possessions and pictures can not be re " - turned . Kirby could now hear enemy soldiers moving uphill toward him ? their chattering , the clang of metal from weapons being worked . He was down on his haunches ; so were Spranza , Spikes , and Taste . None was firing ; their only thought was to hide in the grass which rose two feet higher than a standing man . Taste was slowly dying , two bullets in his neck , multiple mortar shards in his back . Though conscious , he made no complaint , only asking for water , of which there was none . The skirmishers were moving up now and beating the grass on both sides of them , Kirby saw seven of them coming right toward him not ten feet away and knew he was discovered . He still held an M-79 grenade launcher . So did Spikes . They fired right together , and their blast killed five of the enemy ; the other two crawled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the left , spraying the ground between with an automatic pistol . Kirby had his M-79 crooked in his arm ; he had just taken another bullet through the right wrist and was feeling the wound . The skirmisher came on and looked through the grass straight at them . Spikes fired his M-79 . The range was so short that the grenade did n't arm and explode , though by sheer velocity it blew the man 's head off . Had it armed , it would likely have killed both Spikes and Kirby . A second VC closed in from the left , only to turn his back as he almost stumbled over them . Kirby killed him at range five feet . Together , two more groups closed in on them from right and left . Kirby took two hand grenades from Spranza , who by now was wholly down , and throwing in both directions with his wounded arm he drove them off . He had no impression of how many he had killed , or whether he had even scored a hit . He simply knew that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Playing Dead , or Dead While this deadly hide-and-seek game went on downslope , Hereford Landing Zone was being pounded by 105-mm and 155-mm howitzer fires from the valley bases at Savoy and Cobra . Colonel Beard had called for it from his perch aloft , and still earlier Warren had asked for it . Whether it might have been brought in sooner , and done any good , is an open question . There was no right moment for its use until the Americans had cleared away , a moment which could only be guessed at . Now that it had come , and the perimeter ground was being cratered , one of the effects was to drive more of the enemy to the grass field lower down where Kirby and his mates crouched . The game was still on . From downslope , a machine gun opened fire and scythed the grass beside them . Kirby went flat in the nick of time and the bullets zinged directly over his head . Spikes did n't quite make it . One burst caught him in the head . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from him , did n't have to look to know that he was dead , Kirby crawled downslope about ten feet , looking now for a weapon , thinking that the enemy might have dropped one . No luck . He was wholly- out of ammunition and had no arm left but a flare pistol . So he lay flat on his back , wondering what to do . Another skirmisher came up , parted the grass , and looked directly down on him . Kirby rolled over on his side and in the same motion fired his flare pistol upward . The round smashed into the glaring face not three feet above him , getting it right between the eyes . The body was spun completely over by the blast . Kirby did not wait to see more than that . He crawled back the way he had come to get to Spranza . The impulse was that if he had to die , he would rather not be alone . Both men were silent now . There was nothing to say . Time had about run out . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were slightly wrong . Johnson was still face down in his private cleft . Spec 4 Charles Stuckey , whose swift reaction had started the fight , had moved obliquely to the others in getting away from the perimeter . Hidden in the grass alongside the knob , he had had rare fortune , until in the final minutes he came under a grenade shower ? the last of the survivors to get hit . Directly toward Kirby and Spranza , another enemy group moved down the slope . Kirby did n't wait for them . Having nothing to fire , he crawled upward through the elephant grass , leaving Spranza and passing the skirmishers undetected . They fairly stumbled across Spranza . He played dead . His head being gory from a bullet that had entered his left ear and emerged through his nose , it is less remarkable that the deception worked than that he stayed conscious and was still capable of thought . They rolled him over , searched his pockets , took his wallet , knife , and cigarettes , and continued on . Having gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no sense of the barraging of Hereford though the fire had been going all of ten minutes . Now as he crawled upward he at last heard the explosions , and knew what they were . That determined him ; he would crawl to the fire and try to hug it . Two thoughts were in his mind . " Charley will get as far away from this as possible . " If he had to die , that way was still the preferable risk . Halfway hack to the perimeter , his ear told him that the shelling had suddenly ceased . Not knowing what that meant , he still crawled on . It was a tortured , most labored movement , as his last reserve of will and strength was draining away . He got within six feet of the first foxhole before he looked up . What he saw almost numbed his senses and he felt that he would faint away . Sitting in the foxhole pointing an M-16 directly at his head was Pfc Morgan of the First Platoon . He crawled upward a few more feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Hereford was occupied by an American . Captain Warren and company had returned to the hill . Sergeants Owen L. Lewis and James W. Edwards came over to help him to his feet . No words passed between them . They were not merely choked up ; they were sobbing convulsively . And seeing them , Kirby knew tears for the first time that day . Later , Warren said , " If my men cried , it was because they were so damned mad . " Kirby knew better than that ; they were mourning the death of the platoon . Kirby told them where to look for Spranza , not knowing that the company had found him on the way up , or that he already had been evacuated from Hereford by chopper . Stuckey appeared at about that moment and he and Kirby were flown to Ankhe aboard the same Huey . It was some time later that Johnson came in . When the hill went quiet , he started crawling upward . Coming to the tall grass , he saw his friend , Sergeant Wallace W. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Hereford and that sight brought him to his feet . Days later , he was still in a state of shock . Kirby , taken to hospital , of his own choice returned to company duty within ten days , still convalescent . Unlike Johnson , he was fully coherent , with his emotions under tight control , till he spoke of seeing the company in tears . Warren and the company had made that frantic upWard climb to Hereford in exactly thirty-five minutes . The descent over the same trail had taken one hour longer . If a record march , it was to little avail . They saw dead Americans in all but six foxHarper 's Magazine , September lose holes and thought at first that Spranza was the only survivor . All weapons had been taken ; every body had been stripped of personal effects . Warren deployed two of his platoons for a 600-yard sweep to the eastward along both flanks of the ridge . It proved almost barren of result , Though the blood trails were numerous and heavily marked , only five bodies were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by artillery . The fanatical enemy must have hauled away a larger count of dead than was lost to the company . So in the end , they departed as they had come , more suddenly than mysteriously . How the trap had been sprung was easy enough to figure out in retrospect . This enemy force of about two hundred was much too fresh to have followed along in Warren 's wake as he came over the trail from Hill 766 . The time interval was not long enough to have permitted ascent from the lower levels toward which Warren kept moving . If there was assembly and movement , no sound was detected ; last , its main weapons were sighted dead on target . Thus the force must have been there all the time , some yards off the trail and along the ridge sides , as Warren 's column walked through .
