txt The president of Yale University and the former president of the University of Chicago have joined in ? attacking what they term the " desperately corrupted " values of contemporary higher education . While doing so , Dr. A. Whitney Griswold of Yale saw hope that the " service station concept of the university " might be on its way out . However , Dr. Robert M. Hutchins , now president of the Fund for the Republic , charged that " crude pressure and bribery " by nonacademic interests continued to defile educational standards . These views , differing mainly in degree df their forcefulness , are expressed in a booklet , " The University . " It was published yesterday by the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions , which Dr. Hutchins also heads . The " service station concept " mentioned means the universities ' attempt to offer any course urged by outside pressures . Dr. Griswold made his observations in an interview , printed as part of the center 's series on " The American Character .

The fund was originally created by a grant of the Ford Foundation . Customer May Be Wrong In education , Dr. Griswold said , " tha sales doctrine that the customer is always right " does not apply . He recommended that those who tried to interfere with academic freedom be reminded that " the doctor can not help - the patient who insists on making his own diagnosis " and that " the philosopher can not communicate his wisdom to the kibitzer who keeps telling him what to , think . " He attributed the defects in the current standards of education largely to the preparation of high-school teachers . " It 's at the secondary school level that these values are most desperately corrupted , " he said . The values referred to are those of " liberal education . " " They are corrupted by a curriculum , a program of pedagogy which is a methodology of teach , ing that really has the effect of repelling instead of attracting the ablest teachers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be cha'lenged on this issue , which has been a point of heated controversy in the past . Opponents of this opinion say that the majority of high-school teachers , in contrast to elementary and junior ' high-school teachers , come from liberal arts colleges rather than teacher training colleges . Dr. Griswold also struck out at the " political problem " of coping with what he considers misguided teacher certification requirements that have been " frozen into law by many states . " These " icicles of the old system of pedagogy " are , protected by " a militant organization with branches in every state and elaborr te headquarters in Washington , " he said . Presumably Dr. Griswold referred here to the National Education Association , although he did not name it . As a remedy he proposes : 9Better pay and conditions for teachers . 9Training programs for highschool teachers who wish to advance to college or junior college teaching . ilRecruiting many more college-educated women for parttime and full-time teaching . 41Greater mobility for teachers in " the four critical years that form an educational continuity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of high school and the first two years of college . 9Better " liberal education " for all teachers . Finds Family at Fault Dr. Griswold also said that " the family has become too scared of its children ; the children too insecure in their remoteness from their parents ; and the church too much of a social welfare organization for the good of the family or the church or society . " Neither Dr. Griswold nor Dr. Hutchins spared the college presidents . Yale 's president said he believed that " we who hold this office spend so much time justifying what we 're doing that we do n't have time to do what we 're justifying . " Dr. Hutchins , who took no part in the interview , added " a comment . " He said that Dr. Griswold was " more charitable toward the aims and practices of our educational institutions than I think the facts warrant " He asserted that university presidents were too often " the go-getting corporate type , preferably one who is accomplished in public relations . " Their performance , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the amount of money that comes in , by the quantity of brick and mortar that is assembled , by the number of students that enroll , and ih some places by the digits in the football scoreboard . " Dr. Hutchins made history when he abolished varsity foot= ball at Chicago , University presidents who in the last thirty years have had " the inclination , capacity and , the time " to take part in a ' discussion of educational purposes " can be counted on the fingers of one hand , " Dr. Hutchins said . He proposed , that universities be organized " on the federal principle , with a rotating head for the federation . " He denounced as a recent example of the " service station concept " the offering by a ma ! jor state university of a degree ! program in " mobile homes , " ! dealing with the manufacture land distribution of the homes . " Crude pressure and bribery " by special interests have produced this " academic major , " he said . Single copies of the booklet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Calif.
