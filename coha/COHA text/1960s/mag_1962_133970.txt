Women are buying the playing cards these days , and buying them in unprecedented numbers . One of the results , for better or worse , is that after several centuries of peaceful evolution there is now a sort of revolution in the design and decoration of what used to be a very simple piece of pasteboard . Walk into almost any store and you can now purchase the kind of lavish , spectacular , attractive and different decks of cards shown at left . The Cavendish Club may recoil in shock and bridge leagues be appalled , but the ladies are showing their hand . // There is a certain amount of historical irony in this , for one of the earliest records of the use of playing cards is found in a Chinese work of about 1120 A.D. It credits Emperor S'eun-Ho of Cathay with inventing cards for the purpose of keeping his concubines amused at times when the Emperor was otherwise occupied . // During most of the centuries intervening , it was men who bought and used cards . Except for an occasional fortuneteller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all these years the evolution of the playing card was so gradual as to be almost imperceptible , and a sure road to business failure was to come up with a bright idea for change . It is only since women took their seats at the card table that a few major innovations have been tried . // On the theory that the Kaiser 's unpopularity had doomed monarchy everywhere , World War I era playing cards were introduced with soldiers , nurses and sailors replacing the kings , queens and jacks . They did n't last . Soviet Russia found it far simpler to overthrow the entire Russian ruling class than to remove the royalty from the faces of cards . Every previous attempt to depose the legendary monarchs of the Houses of Spades , Hearts , Diamonds and Clubs has had to buck such long-entrenched habits that sales have been made largely as souvenirs or curios. // Even some good ideas have failed . At least two attempts have been made to change clubs to blue and diamonds to orange , in order to make cards easier to sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are they now ? Round cards , popular more than 500 years ago , are back on the market again . About 40 years ago , when they were also reintroduced , expert cardplayers admitted they were easy to shuffle , deal , sort and read  --  and refused to play with them . // I confess to being responsible for at least two innovations and one story about cards . I had decks made with the point value shown under the indices of honor cards , so that bridge players could more easily count the point value of their hands . Nobody but beginners liked this idea , and not many will long admit to being beginners . I also designed cards with big indices , like those used in my TV show . These are now on the market generally and are fine for the nearsighted . They are also , no doubt , popular with those who like to get a look at their opponents ' cards . It may be that they will catch on in some circles , especially for exhibitions . But I must report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them somewhat disconcerting . // My card story concerns the World Bridge Olympiad in Turin , Italy where , with the cooperation of the United States Playing Card Company , I was able to present 1,400 decks with my signature as a back design for use in the tournament . Now , playing-card manufacture in most European countries is a heavily taxed monopoly . So permission to bring the cards into Italy was granted only on condition that every deck be taken out of the country after the tournament . // It was assumed that it would be possible to present an occasional deck to those who wished souvenirs by bringing out of the country a few 50-or 51-card decks . But the Italian government had thought of that , too . It warned that it did n't want to count decks when we left , just aces of spades . Needless to say , all the decks that went into Italy were brought right back out . // High taxes and the monopolies on playing cards abroad are responsible for the invention of plastic cards , which have been on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plastic card was invented , the tax was so high that decks were manufactured oversize , with huge margins . When the edges got dirty the decks were trimmed down so that they could still be used . Even at their selling price of $10 per set , the plastic cards could have put quite a dent in the monopoly 's business  --  so the latter quickly bought out the plastics manufacturer and his processes and scrapped the operation . The inventor came to the U.S. , where he persuaded Ely Culbertson to put his cards on the market , and they have had some measure of success . // The " invention " that made a patent on the plastic card possible is closely tied to the reason why playing cards are called pasteboards . Nonplastic cards are printed on pasted-together boards , or sheets of paper ; otherwise , if you sat with the light behind you your opponent could read your cards through the backs . Originally this problem was solved by pasting a sheet of brown paper between the two outer layers . Later the problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paste . The inventor of the plastic card created neither the plastic , nor , of course , the idea of the playing card . He simply created a way to make the plastic opaque . // Opacity is only one of the difficulties in making what superficially appear to be very simple things . Pitfalls are numerous . There was , for example , the printer who thought he could revolutionize the industry . Instead of printing a full deck , or two full decks , on one sheet , as is normally done , he planned to print all of the aces of spades on one sheet , all of the kings of spades on another , etc . Then he would collate 52 sheets , and in one die cut he could get more than 100 decks . // Beating the sharpies // A few hundred years ago this scheme might have worked , since cards were printed on one side only and the backs were left white . Today , with the back design an important part of every card , the printer learned he could manufacture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the separate sheets would have gradations of color that would soon become apparent enough for the sharp player to " read " each card from the back . The problem of uniformity is so important that several years ago the United States Playing Card Company had to recall and destroy 300,000 decks . The back of one of the cards had been found to have a hairline imperfection. // Yet printing is a mild headache compared with the difficulty of cutting and assembling a deck . Since the deck is all on the same sheet , the sheet must be cut into strips and the strips fed through a kind of biscuit cutter that stamps out the individual cards . Simultaneously , the edges of each card must be pressed into a feather edge . This edge , invisible to the eye and scarcely perceptible to the touch , is the reason why the cards can be shuffled without fraying . The nature of the machines that do this work is among the most jealously guarded of trade secrets . There is no secondhand market ; when the machines are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the country 's largest printers of greeting cards decided to bring out a playing card line and encountered two ambushes that prevented more than moderate success . The company imported its cards from West Germany . But the German cards , it found , had slightly different faces from American ones and , as we have said , card players do n't relish change . Almost as important , the cards were a fraction of an inch wider than standard American decks . This meant they would not fit into duplicate-bridge boards . // Of all card games , bridge has had the widest effect on the playing card business , and not merely because of the volume of packs bought for that purpose . Bridge caused the width of cards to be changed from 2 ? to 2 ? inches , in order to facilitate the holding of thirteen cards  --  especially , one might add , in the smaller hands of women . And it was women who got bored with the conventional geometric designs that had been the bestsellers and still remain so in the gambling houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can buy cards with Mona Lisa smiling from the back , or find yourself staring fixedly at a still life of pink asters as your partner takes you out of a business double . // Important , too , is the effect that bridge and women have had in giving the playing card new respectability . No longer called " the devil 's picture book , " rarely the object of religious sermons , the deck of playing cards has become part of the entertainment equipment in millions of homes . // Yet the grand old legends and the mystery still persist , relics of a day when cards were solely the implements of the fortune-teller and the gambler . The ace of spades remains the death card ; the queen of spades is the dark lady ; the four of clubs " the devil 's bedposts , " because it looks like the top of a fourposter . Finally , there is the nine of diamonds , called " the curse of Scotland , " for any of half a dozen fanciful reasons , ranging from the possibility that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Earl of Stair , loathed in Scotland for his connection with the Massacre of Glencoe , to the highly improbable theory that Cumberland , " the Butcher of Culloden , " wrote the orders for that battle on the back of this card . // Now , that 's about the only thing the ladies have not thought of putting on the backs of their cards  --  battle orders for a massacre .
