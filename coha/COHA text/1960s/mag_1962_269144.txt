The Senator from Arizona rose , and the chamber hushed to hear him . He was tall and greying , with an eagle 's nose and a noble brow . He wore striped pants , a wing collar , a spade-tailed coat , and nose glasses leashed with yards of black , fluttering ribbon . He rolled out his words with infinite relish . " My faults , " he cried , " are obvious . There can be no doubt I have my full share . I suffer from cacothes loquendi , a mania or itch for talking , from vanity and morbidity , and , as is obvious to everyone who knows me , an inborn , an inveterate flair for histrionics . " Democrat Henry Fountain Ashurst was off on one of the orations that were the delight of the Senate from 1912 to 1940 . <P> The subject of his speech hardly mattered , for Ashurst could have held his audience spellbound by reciting the contents of a telephone book . The nation knew him as " Five-Syllable Henry , " the ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself as a victim of " the inflatus of oratory " and a " veritable peripatetic bifurcated volcano . " The Senate has not seen his likes since he left , and it will not soon again . For there was only one Henry Fountain Ashurst , and he died last week at 87 . <P> Matter of Course . He was born in Nevada in a covered wagon , grew up in the Arizona Territory . His father was a rancher , but Henry himself had dreams of greater glory . In his blue-backed speller , when he was ten , he wrote : " Henry Fountain Ashurst , U.S. Senator from Arizona . " To develop his voice , the young cowboy rode into the hills to address the landscape . He exhorted the boulders to rise against the iron heel of oppression . He demanded of the mountains that they nominate Grant for a third term . While other cowpunchers twanged The Old Chisholm Trail , Ashurst ( who knew countless stanzas , both clean and dirty , of that song ) quoted Shakespeare to the coyotes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the Grand Canyon . " he said years later . " As a matter of course , I went into politics . " <P> As a turnkey in the Flagstaff county jail , Ashurst read Blackstone voraciously , later took up the law . At 21 he was elected to the territorial legislature , then to the territorial senate . In 1912 , when Arizona was admitted to statehood , he was a natural choice for one of the state 's first two U.S. Senate seats ( the other : Marcus A. Smith ) .
