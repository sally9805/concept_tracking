A practical , cold-cash incentive to encourage more good programs , plus a believable threat of punishment for broadcasters who do n't provide them . MR . NEWTON N. MINOWis probably the most determined ? and certainly the most articulate ? man who has yet served as Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission . Ever since his celebrated " wasteland " speech , he has gone up and down the land announcing his intention to give this country better television . Mr. Minow 's tactics are a combination of needle and threat . He has used his wit and eloquence to prod the networks and TV stations into doing a better job ; and at the same time he has brandished the threat of several kinds of legislative and administrative action to force them to improve if they do n't do so voluntarily . But so far nothing much has happened . The entertainment fare ? which is the bulk of TV programing ? on the three networks has taken no noticeable turn for the better and the announced schedules for next fall look like more of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modest increase in so-called public-affairs programing . Perhaps this is a reaction to Mr. Minow 's needling . On the other hand , it could be argued that current history made this development inevitable . Americans in the past few years have been increasingly interested in world affairs , just as they were from the time of Munich to the end of World War II . News and comment dominated radio in those years , and in the past twelve months TV could scarcely avoid paying a good deal of attention to such stirring events as the Cuban fiasco , Laos , Berlin , and space exploration . Mr. Minow 's campaign is not bogging down for lack of zeal and dedication . But apparently there is something wrong with his weapons . The only one which sometimes concerns broadcasters stems from the FCC 's power to refuse to renew a station 's license ( which it theoretically holds for only three years ) because the FCC disapproves of its program performance . No previous FCC Chairman ever tried CO take away a TV station 's license for program deficiency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half since he took office . For in fact the threat of license revocation is rather like invoking the death sentence to punish a series of traffic violations . If a penalty is too severe , no one really believes it will be used . Certainly the TV industry has not been sufficiently alarmed by Mr. Minow to change its ways significantly . 28 A NEW WEAPON TO GET BETTER TV What Mr. Minow needs , it would seem , is a new weapon , which station operators will take seriously . He needs a punishment that really fits the crime ? and that takes into account the economic facts of TV broadcasting as it is now organized in the United States . To be sure , some critics think that our entrenched pattern of sponsor plus advertising-agency plus commercial-network plus local-station control condemns us permanently to a basic diet of mediocre , gutless , and shoddy fare . I take a less gloomy view . There are enough bright oases in the " wasteland " to indicate that the broadcasters know what better programs are , and how to produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more good programs on our home screens ( which is Mr. Minow 's goal and my own ) unless the FCC gets hold of an effective instrument which it is really prepared to use . Before proposing such a new weapon ? and the strategy for its use ? it is vital that we understand the terrain we have to fight over . Mr. Minow has come upon the scene very late in the day . More than a decade ago the government gave away the twelve precious channels on the Very High Frequency band to profit-making companies , without setting up yardsticks CO define their real responsibilities . Mr. Minow himself has acknowledged that he is stuck with the status quo . " No one has seriously advocated that we alter the underpinning of our television system , " he said in a speech last January . " No one I know of has proposed governmental control or ownership of television . We are determined to preserve our own unique mixture : a television industry based on freedom of expression , privately owned , and operated for a private profit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public 's airwaves , must also operate in the public interest . " The key phrase in this statement is " public interest . " Before deciding just how it can be safeguarded we need to be clear about what it is . This looks like a relatively simple legal and semantic problem . But in fact it is n't . To illustrate , let me refer to a particular Thursday evening when I arrive at my home in Manhattan , weary after a late stint at the office . Bernard B. Smith is a Manhattan lawyer who has long been interested in the radio and TV fields , acting for producers and performers , and for the BBC . He is also counsel to the New York Building Congress , the British-American Chamber of Commerce , and the Irish Export Board . This is his twelfth article in " Harper 's " since 1942 . I pick up the paper to see what solace TV can provide . On Channel 2 at 10:00 P.M. there is " CBS Reports " ? a program titled " The Balance of Terror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to about the horrors of nuclear war , I reject the chance to consider further my own slim prospects of survival . Channel 11 at the same time offers " Sing Along with Mitch , " which I also turn down since I do n't care much for popular music . After a quick look at the fare offered by the other New York television stations , I switch on Channel 7 and regress comfortably to the cops-androbbers games of my youth in the form of The Untouchables . " Now , in this simple choice , exercised nightly in many millions of American homes , I have apparently not acted in the public interest . By satisfying my perverse appetite for violence in dramatic form I have lent aid and comfort to a form of TV entertainment that is widely condemned . Further , by rejecting " CBS Reports " I have diminished its audience ? and therefore its attractiveness to sponsors The behavior of audiences is , obviously , not always in the public interest . And there are other complications which become evident as I happily watch a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unerring fire of the three bullet-proof " Untouchables . " I notice suddenly that Robert Stack , playing the hero , has worn the same broad-lapel gray suit for almost three years . Presumably this is done to give a " period " flavor to the program but 1 doubt that many viewers care when these exciting events took place . 1 know enough about the men 's clothing industry to realize that such things as the width of lapels and the number of buttons arc changed from time to time . I also know that the industry suffers because men so seldom buy new suits . Would it not be in the public interest , convenience , and necessity ( the basis on which TV stations are licensed ) if the FCC required Robert Stack to change the style and color of his suit at least semi-annually ? The men 's clothing industry , of course , can not pay him to do it , for this would be payola . ) But why could not the FCC insist ? since employers and workers in a major industry would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufacturers ? Could it not also be argued that mass consumption , employment , and prosperity are advanced by TV advertising and that it is therefore contrary to the public interest to permit the sale of remote-control devices which enable viewers to switch off commercials ? And how about cigarette advertising ? Since publication of the latest British medical report on smoking and lung cancer , tobacco commercials on TV in the United Kingdom now appear only in the late evening hours when the children are in bed . In Italy , all TV tobacco advertising has been eliminated . Would it not be in the " public interest " for the FCC similarly to limit or proscribe cigarette commericals on TV in America ? * The FCC , however , does not reason in this fashion . Instead it relies on a definition of " the public interest " which is , in my view , even less defensible because it is a relic of the age of radio and not in any sense pertinent to modern TV in the United States . WHAT LOCAL STATIONS CA N'T DO I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fourteen different types of programs " usually necessary to meet the public interest , needs , and desires of the community in which the station is located . " The first item is " Opportunity for Local Self-expression . " Next comes " The Development and Use of Local Talent . " The rest of the list includes religious and educational programs ; editorializing by licensee ; agricultural programs ; weather and market reports ; service to minority groups . Fourteenth and last is " Entertainment Programing . " Now , 1 submit that most of these local-service Functions should properly be performed by local radio stations across the country . Television is the costliest of all mass media . It can not and should not deal extensively with local community problems ? except for major city and state events and political campaigns . It is , in general , not economically Feasible for a local television station to initiate programs of high quality . In fact ? as most people who live outside the great metropolitan areas can attest ? when a local station leaves the networks , the screen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the commercials of Main Street stores ; or a newscaster reading bulletins from the wire services ; or a speech by a local dignitary . Now all these programs , except for the ancient film , gain nothing by being seen as well as heard . * The U.S. Supreme Court in NBC vs . U.S. ( 519 US 190 ) said : " The Commission has ... the burden of determining the composition of that traffic . " Traffic means that which goes on the air , i.e. , commercials as well as programs . They could be presented just as well , and far more economically , on radio . It must he remembered that when sight was added to sound in broadcasting , Congress did not enact a new law or amend the old one to deal with this new medium. * By default it empowered the FCC to apply the same rules to TV as to radio . Sixteen years later , radio has become almost entirely a local community service , while TV has evolved into a national mass medium . In this context the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather ridiculous . The chief question discussed was what local community service was being provided by TV broadcasters . As could be expected , a churchman , a rabbi , and many minority groups complained bitterly . No one even hinted that the public interest is best served by using TV primarily as a national medium , with radio doing the job locally . It is a fallacy to think of TV as chiefly a medium for " local " talent and interests . It is also a waste of time to berate the networks ? as was done at the Chicago hearings ? for trying to force too many of their programs on their affiliates . It is regrettable , of course , if actors and musicians are out of work in Chicago . But creating employment for them is not going to provide better TV Fare for viewers in the Chicago area . Good TV programing is just too expensive for the resources of a single station , and it is getting costlier all the time . Nor will the local advertiser Foot the bill . A local Chicago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent of TV homes in America . For it an advertiser will not pay more than 5 per cent of what he would pay for a national network show , Excessive network - domination " is not the problem . The real difficulty is twofold : ( 1 ) all too many local stations fail to let their viewers see the good programs offered by the networks , " and ( 2 ) with due deference to the public service performed by TV as the national tranquilizer , * See : " Television : There Ought to be a Law " by Bernard B. Smith , Harper 's , September 1948. ** In its spring 1962 issue the Columbia Journalism Review published a report on local " black-outs " on public-affairs TV . A typical station turned down one out of four informational programs offered ii . In one- and two-station cities the pattern ranged from high acceptance to almost total rejection . For example WLWD , Dayton , Ohio , refused eight out of nine informational programs offered to it by NBC and ABC while the one station in Ft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Oregon , accepted most of what was offered . Two Augusta , Georgia , stations turned down ten of thirteen programs . 30 A NEW WEAPON TO GET the networks do not provide enough programs that stimulate thought or give information . The FCC has no power to enforce its will directly on the networks . How , then , can they be compelled to do a better job ? The most appealing answer is based on the classic American faith in competition . Instead of three networks , let us have four , five , or a dozen which will compete for the market through the quality of their product . Attractive as is this notion , it is , in fact , unworkable ? as we can see from a look at recent TV history . COMPETING FOR ONE PIE W ATCHING television is a Form of hearthside relaxation rather than an " occasion . " Perhaps this is why the size of the audience fluctuates so little . A motion-picture manager can still all his house with a Marilyn Monroe film while few people would trouble to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunset Strip . " But TV is a habit . For example , between the hours of seven and eleven in the evening in the first six months of 1958 ( a period which critics often call " the Golden Age of Television " ) some 57 per cent of the country 's TV sets were regularly tuned in . Three years later ( when networks were heavily overcast with Western gun battles and Private Eyes ) , the same proportion ? about 57 per cent ? of all potential viewers were also in Front of their screens . In other words the size of the TV audience does not change much , regardless of the cultural merits , or lack of them , of the evening offerings or the number of stations on the air. * What does change , however , is the slice of the constant audience pie that goes to different shows . And this division of the audience has less to do with the inherent merits of a particular program than with the immediate alternatives available . Let us consider , for example , the sad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Golden Age mentioned above . On a typical November evening in 1958 this excellent drama was being BETTER TV watched in more than ten million homes . A year later it had less than five million viewers . Yet in the intervening twelve months there had been no perceptible change in the total size of the television audience at that hour . What had happened was simply that the American Broadcasting system had become a full-Hedged network and was now offering " The Untouchables , " a competitive dramatic program with the added ingredient of violence , which siphoned off more than seven million viewers from the other two networks at this hour . A year later " Playhouse 90 " left the air because its audience was no longer large enough to justify i he cost to the sponsor . Before ABC appeared on the scene the two networks ( without consultation with each other ) engaged in what is known as " counter-programing " ; that is , they avoided presenting shows of the same general character in the same time segment . For example , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dramatic program , CBS did not try to woo viewers with similar tastes , but presented a situation comedy called " December Bride . " Counter-programing served to increase the total audience , rather than to contract it . But in the fierce competitive struggle that followed ABC 's emergence as a network , counter-programing virtually disappeared . A variety of dramatic programs vied with each other at the same hours , and , regrettably , Westerns , Private Eyes , and other violence-filled dramas won over the " Playhouse 90 " non-violent type of dramatic offering . Public-affairs and information programs are also affected by the lack of counter-programing . For instance , on Friday evenings from 10:30 to 11:00 , CBS presents " Eyewitness to History " while at the same time , NBC offers " Chet Huntley Reporting . " Both are excellent and it is irksome to many potential viewers to be forced to miss one of them . It is also senseless for two worthwhile programs to divide the one audience . The salvation of TV does not lie merely in " more competition . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in time , the addition of a fourth or fifth network will not add to the size of the television audience . It will simply serve to divide an existing audience among more stations , and thus reduce the audience available for the better and inevitably more expensive programs , and thus render it less likely that they can attract commercial sponsorship . For it is a fact that when there was less competition ( that is , only two fully nationwide networks ) , high-quality programs had a far better chance of economic survival ? which is a necessity in the profit-based TV system to which we are committed . in the public interest , broadcasters should work together toward insulating good programs from the competition of others which appeal to the same types of viewers . I am confident that such a positive step to provide better television fare for the American people could he taken without fear of antitrust action by the Department of Justice . Attorney General Robert Kennedy has assured the networks that they are in no such danger if they work together to provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apply to a genuine effort to give high-quality adult programs an improved chance of survival . THE ADVERTISER 'S ROLE T . be sure , there are certain kinds of documentary and other worthwhile non-entertainment programs which will never attract large enough audiences to justify their cost to the sponsor . The price of national network time alone can exceed $100,000 for a single hour . One remedy may be in what is known as the " magazine " concept of TV advertising . Magaiine advertising rates are based on circulation and generally go up with each thousand additional readers . Similarly , TV advertising rates could be computed on the basis of the number of viewers reached ( which could be certified , as are magazine circulations , by an Audit Bureau of recognized integrity ) . This system is currently used during the summer months on commercial TV in Great Britain . Here is how it would work as a practical matter : The advertiser would not select the program on which his commercial is to appear . He would merely be allowed to specify his preference as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And he would pay only in terms of TV homes reached , on a cost-per-thousand basis . This method of selling advertising space on TV would go far toward freeing the medium from the yoke of sponsor domination . The concept that the sponsor 's product is " identified " with a particular program has caused a steady retreat from subject matter which might offend anyone . ( In this connection it should be noted that supervision of programing by the government , or an official advisory committee , would not have an emancipating effect . Public officials are , if anything , more timid than businessmen about controversial subjects or personalitieswhich might wound the sensibilities of Congressmen or their constituents . ) Nor should any trade association be given the power of precensorship over TV programs . There has been considerable pressure for some kind of censorship ever since the lamentable " Bus Stop " episode starring Fabian , a teen-age idol , was telecast last December . This program , a tasteless witches ' brew of murder , lust , and alcohol , rightly shocked many viewers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be taken to prevent such revolting programs from being shown . However , the public ? the only legitimate censor ? by its lively protests has since insured that this single flagrant mistake is altogether unlikely to be repeated . The continuing problem on TV is not immoral programs but spineless programs . And the latter is what we will get if a trade association such as the National Association of Broadcasters exercises precensorship . For example , the NAB statement at the time hinted that " The Benefactors " ? a program on " The Defenders " which dealt with illegal abortion ? should not be aired at a peak evening hour . This show ( presented by CBS last April 28 at 8:30 P.M. in the East , 7:30 in the Midwest ) was a striking example of the kind of controversy that scares official bodies ? and sponsors ? although it was shown on 174 stations and most subsequent audience comments were favorable . Beforehand three companies ? Kimberly-Clark , Brown Williamson , and Lever Brothers ? withdrew from sponsorship . CBS was sufficiently concerned about the show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to its affiliated stations . Only ten CBS American affiliates decided against it . The sponsor 's spot was filled at the last minute by the Speidel Corporation , which apparently decided that the sale of its product , wrist-watch bands , could survive identification with a vital human problem . I can not believe it is in the public interest to let manufacturers decide that we can not see certain programs because they might displease potential buyers of their cigarettes , cleaning tissues , or shampoos . Nor do I care to rely on the less tender ? it would seem ? sensibilities of watchband purchasers . This is why it is high time we adopted the magazine concept . Under this system the TV industry will derive huge income from the highly popular programs and Less from more serious fare . Sustaining public-affairs programs will no longer be needed . Broadcasters will derive some rev32 A NEW WEAPON TO GET BETTER TV enue from all types of programs and will have no further excuse for not providing balanced , fare , free of sponsor control . But total broadcast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public interest can not only survive , but increase in number . OPENING UP THE AIR CHANNELS : HOW FAR ? ESPITE strong evidence to the contrary , our American faith in competition persists as a remedy for most evils . Mr. Minow , like his predecessors , has paid obeisance to this principle and . like them , he has run into trouble . The obvious way to increase competition in TV is to open up more channels . Why not license more stations to operate on the little-used seventy channels in the UHF hand of the spectrum ( Ultra High Frequency channels 14 to 83 ) as well as the twelve VHF ( Very High Frequency channels 2 to 13 ) now overloaded with TV stations ? An attempt to do precisely this was made in 1952 when the FCC adopted a program to license both UHF and VHF stations in the same communities . The plan was a failure for ? as it turned out ? UHF can not compete with VHF . This is chiefly because VHF can send its signal much further than UHF . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience . In 1960 the country 's 458 VHF stations earned profits of $210 million while the 76 UHF stations made an aggregate profit of only $300,000 . Most TV sets now in use in the U.S. can receive only VHF . They can , however , be adapted to receive UHF also by a device which costs about $30 . In 1955 NBC undertook to operate a UHF station ( WBUF , Channel 17 ) in Buffalo , This station received all NBC network programs , and large sums were spent to purchase and operate it . Nonetheless , NBC gave up the ghost in the fall of 1958 , took the station off the air , and made an independent VHF station its Buffalo affiliate . WBUF could not compete even though , at this time , roughly 90 per cent of the television sets in Buffalo had been equipped to receive UHF . During this same period CBS was making a similar attempt to use a UHF station ( WXIX , Channel 18 ) as its affiliate in Milwaukee . Like NBC , CBS finally took WXIX off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At about the same time a VHF station in Milwaukee was sold for close to $14.5 million . As in Buffalo , at this time 90 per cent of the television sets in Milwaukee homes were equipped to receive UHF . Clearly a UHF station can not prosper if it must compete with a VHF station . The larger audience is the one that attracts the advertiser . A different approach to the problem was formulated both by the Senate Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee in 1956 and by the Antitrust Subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee in 1957 . Both committees referred to the long-range solution of shifting all television to UHT , and recommended that in the meantime , " where the public interest requires , " the FCC move all TV broadcasting ? in markets where such a move is feasible ? to the UHF band . This step would make materially more channels available in such communities ; and all the stations in these localities could compete on equal terms for the same potential audience . In July 1961 the FCC derided that such action would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wisconsin ; Rockford , Illinois ; Hartford , Connecticut ; Erie , Pennsylvania ; Binghamton , New York ; Champaign-Urbana , Illinois ; Columbia , South Carolina ; and Montgomery , Alabama . Each of these was selected particularly because 75 to 85 per cent of the TV sets in the area are equipped to receive both UHF and VHF ; hence the people would not he inconvenienced if all TV were moved into UHF . Not surprisingly , a storm broke around Mr. Minow 's head . For the broadcasters are well aware of the central economic tact that has been cited here , i.e. , that more stations and more programs do not mean more viewers in a given locality but simply a splintering of the same-size audience . Here was a real threat to profits built on monopoly or quasi-monopoly and the VHF broadcasters howled in anguish . Stanch friends on Capitol Hill rushed to their defense . Many Congressmen are highly sympathetic to their local TV stations . Some indeed have a financial interest in stations themselves . But all of them depend more and more for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even more nervous about offending TV stations now that Mr. Minow has encouraged broadcasters to editorialize . The pressure was such that Mr. Minow began to retreat by agreeing to a conditional moratorium . No change will he made for the present in the eight communities involved , nor will any new move to UHF be initiated in any other community , The existing VHF stations will therefore continue to enjoy their huge competitive advantage over the UHF stations . The move into UHF will take place , however , in four Other communities where plans were well advanced . Minow conditioned this moratorium on passage by Congress of a piece of legislation known as the All-Channel Receiver Bill ( which passed the House and was approved by the Senate Commerce Committee this spring ) . The bill authorizes the FCC to require that in the future all TV sets shipped in interstate commerce will have to be capable of receiving UHF as well as VHF telecasts . The theory behind this law is that , once the FCC implements it , there will be a rush of applications to operate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will he equipped in time to receive UHF as well as VHF . Thus the benefits of wide-open competition will bring to all of us the blessing of better TV . But in fact , nothing of the sort is likely to take place . Perhaps there will he an increase in the number of educational stations operating on UHF if large subsidies can be found for them . The $32-million grant of matching funds provided by Congress this year ( with no more than $1 million going to any one state ) is no more than a drop in the bucket compared to the cost of setting up and operating a worthwhile network of educational TV stations . For example , the new educational TV station in New York which expects to take to the air this fall anticipates a cost of $3 million for its first year . But even if the years ahead see a great increase in telecasts on topics like the Roots of the Democratic Process or the History of the Russian Drama , this is not the average , or even the superior , viewer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for more and better dramas , concerts , and documentaries dealing with the real world around us . Unfortunately if such programs are of high quality they are extremely expensive. * And the money to produce them and pay time charges is available only in the marketplace of commercial TV. ** As demonstrated by the experience of NBC in Buffalo and CBS in Milwaukee , it is close to impossible for a UHF station to compete if there are two or more VHF stations serving the same locality . And it can not compete effectively even if there is only one VHF station . This has been found true even when most viewers * Serious dramatic offerings such as Graham Greene 's " The Power and the Glory " with Laurence Olivier and Henry James 's The Turn of the Screw " with Ingrid Bergman both cost over a quarter of a million dollars , exclusive of time charges . This is not . however , any greater than the cost of an hour of Bob Hope or Bing Crosby. **More than a dozen years have elapsed since Zenith 's Chicago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as yet that it will ever be economically feasible and socially desirable for viewers rather than advertisers to pay for TV programs.in the area can receive both VHF and UHF . Clearly , then , the All-Channel Receiver Bill is doomed to fail in its long-range objective . It is fortunate , therefore , that Mr. Minow is not proposing to surrender ? but has merely suspended ? the power of the FCC to move all stations in a given area into UHF . Out of this power the FCC can fashion a new and effective weapon , and one it need not hesitate to use . PLOWING BACK PROFITS N O F C C Chairman really contemplates confiscating a TV station in which investors have built up a huge equity over the years . Hence the triennial applications for license renewal are rarely more than pro forma proceedings . The outcome is never in doubt . Indeed , all the FCC ever asks is that a station 's program performance be in keeping with that promised when it received a license or its license was last renewed . No sophisticated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hazy commitments he made when he got his license . He needs merely to show that he schedules a religious program on Sunday morning , an educational program on a weekday morning ( before most people are awake ) , allows a local dignitary to expound the need for a bond issue to replace cesspools with a sewage system , and telecasts some local basketball games . Having thus " served community needs , " he can now he sure his license will be renewed . I propose that the FCC begin seriously to examine whether every station making a high profit out of a free franchise has in fact served the public interest , not on pain of refusing to re-license it , but with the threat of action that can drastically reduce the station 's profits . Take , for example , a community which has only two stations . One of these is in a position to choose between the programs of two networks and is reaping huge profits from its monopolistic position . If this station regularly selects programs like " The Untouchables " rather than " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this decision is in the public interest ( despite my affection for " The Untouchables " ) . In effect , the FCC could say : " You are making far too much money in the use of a public franchise for which you paid nothing but which you promised to operate in the public interest , convenience , and necessity . You can continue to enjoy the near monopoly which guarantees your high profits only if it is exercised in the public interest . " After sixteen years of experience with television ? without our having to spell it out for you ? you know what kinds of programs you ought to eliminate and those you ought to add to your schedule . When your station license comes up for renewal , if we find that you are still making the same high percentage of profits but that you arc still , for example , using the time between 5:00 and 6:30 P.M. to broadcast old movies in place of worthwhile children 's programs or good dramatic or public-affairs shows , then we will be obliged to take appropriate steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , would be to move all TV in this city into the UHF band . The result would , in all probability , be five or six stations in operation with a sharp decrease in profits as the same-size audience is split six instead of two ways . This threat l believe would be a powerful inducement to the two VHF stations in the community to work together to ensure a better quality of programing immediately . It would , of course , he unrealistic to try to hold all TV stations to the same standards . For example , in 1960 the three Cleveland stations earned a total prat ' of more than $8 million ( approximately equal to half of their gross revenues ) and the three stations in Detroit and three in Boston did almost as well . Obviously a higher level of programing can be expected of them than of those in the Tacoma-Seattle level . There five stations ? too many for the population served ? had total revenues of about $8 million and wound up the year with an aggregate loss of $26,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if a station is making money . However , the vast majority of VHF stations have enjoyed steadily rising profits over the years . Network profits , on the other hand , have declined , although the network-owned stations continue to be highly lucrative . At the present time the networks are trying to induce the stations to accept decreased payments for the network programs they show. * It is essential , in my view , for the networks to have substantial revenues which they can plow back into better programs . For , as we have seen , it is primarily from the networks that first-rate programs must come . The last thing any VHF broadcaster in the hundred or so rich markets wants is to be moved into the UHF band . To combat this threat , these stations will demand of their networks more and better dramatic and children 's programs . As *An affiliated station receives roughly 20 per cent of its total revenue from the network for network-sponsored programs . and 80 per cent from national , regional , and local sponsors . a matter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the worthwhile public-affairs programs offered by the networks and will ask for more . And they will be prepared to reduce payments from the networks to provide the wherewithal for better network programs . If a station should fail to respond to this approach , the FCC will have to carry out its threat and move all television in the area into the UHF band . Passage of the All-Channel Receiver Bill gives real bite to this threat. * In any event , FCC administrative procedures ? with the inevitable appeals ? ensure sufficient delay to provide time for most homes in the city affected to be equipped with all-channel receivers . So local viewers will not be inconvenienced . In such a city , profits of the once-lucrative VHF stations will dwindle sharply . But the lesson will not be lost on stations elsewhere . I believe that the threat of moving all stations in an area into UHF should be used circumspectly rather than on the sweeping eight-city scale Mr. Minow attempted last year and from which he is now retreating . For it is the threat rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of diminished profits , rather than in the actuality of increased competition , lies our best hope for better TV . Certainly , better programs are not going to result from competition between more stations and more networks vying with each other for the same-size audience ; nor from any form of pre-censorship whether by a public body or a trade association . What is needed is co-operation between the networks and stations to provide better programing and an economic basis for television that among other things Frees program content from any control by commercial sponsors . Above all , we must demand that the existing VHF stations pay for their lucrative monopolies by doing a better job in the public interest . Eventually , I hope , the television industry will see that it is only by behaving like a public utility that it can avoid being treated like one . * Because an all-channel receiver costs more than the ordinary VHF set , the American people will have to spend approximately an extra billion dollars when the time comes to replace their present receivers . Chances are that $900 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as 710 more than 10 per cent of the purchasers will be exposed to UHF stations . ( So far is educational stations are concerned ? their programs on the average arc rarely viewed by as much as one per cent of the people who own sets that could receive them . ) However , this outlay will he well justified if it provides the FCC with an effective weapon for defending the public interest in better programs .
