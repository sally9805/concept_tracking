A screen has been placed at the back ( that is , at the actors ' entrance ) to shut this corner off from the hotel guests . A table in the center of the stage with a large RESERVED sign on it . Various chairs . At the end of the stage farthest from the entrance is a low bench ; above it we are to assume some large windows looking onto Fifth Avenue . Enter Edward Blake , a lawyer , fifty . He is followed by Paul , a waiter , fifty-five . BLAKE ( Rubbing his hands : ) Paul , we have work to do . PAUL Yes , Mr. Blake . BLAKE There will be three for tea . I arranged with Mr. Gruber that this corner would be screened off for us ; and I specially asked that you would wait on us . As I say , we have some work to do . ( Smilingly giving him an envelope ) There 's a hundred dollars , Paul , for whatever strain you may be put to . PAUL Thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mr. Blake ? BLAKE I 'm going to ask you to do some rather strange things . Are you a good actor , Paul ? PAUL Well  --  I often tell the young waiters that our work is pretty much an actor 's job . BLAKE I 'm sure you 're a very good one . Now the guests today are my niece , Diana Colvin .  --  You know Miss Colvin , do n't you ? p. 3 PAUL ( With pleasure : ) Oh , yes , Mr. Blake . Everyone knows Miss Colvin . BLAKE And her fianc  --  that 's a secret still  --  Mr. Osterman ? PAUL Which Mr. Osterman , sir ? BLAKE Roger  --  Roger Osterman . You know him ? PAUL Oh , yes , sir . BLAKE Now it 's not clear which of us is host . But it 's clear to me which of us is host . Roger Osterman has invited us to tea . He will pay the bill . PAUL Yes , sir . BLAKE There may be some difficulty about it  --  some distress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he will pay the bill . ( A slight pause while he looks hard and quizzically at Paul , who returns his gaze with knowing raised eyebrows . ) Now at about 5:20 you 're going to bring Mr. Osterman a registered letter . The messenger will be waiting in the hall for Mr. Osterman 's signature . Roger Osterman will ask to borrow half a dollar of me . I wo n't have half a dollar . He will then turn and ask to borrow half a dollar of you . And you wo n't hear him . PAUL I beg your pardon , sir ? BLAKE He 'll ask to borrow half a dollar of you , but you wo n't hear him . You 'll be sneezing or something . Your face will be buried in your handkerchief . Have you a cold , Paul ? p. 4 PAUL No , sir . We 're not allowed to serve when we have colds . BLAKE Well , you 're growing deaf . It 's too bad . But you wo n't hear him . PAUL ( Worriedly : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Raising his voice ) " Yes , Mr. Osterman , I 'll get some hot tea , at once . " This appeal to you for money may happen several times . PAUL ( Abashed : ) Very well , Mr. Blake , if you wish it . BLAKE Now , Paul , I 'm telling you why I 'm doing this . You 're an intelligent man and an old friend . My niece is going to marry Roger Osterman . I 'm delighted that my niece is going to marry him . He 's a very nice fellow  --  and what else is there about him , Paul ? PAUL Why , sir  --  it is understood that he is very rich . BLAKE Exactly . But the Ostermans are not only fine people and very rich people  --  they have oddities about them , too , have n't they ?  --  A certain oddity ? ( Blake slowly executes the following pantomime : he puts his hands into his trouser pockets and brings them out , open , empty and " frozen . " ) PAUL ( Reluctantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 5 BLAKE Have you a daughter , Paul , or a niece ? PAUL Yes , sir . I have two daughters and three nieces . BLAKE Then you know : we older men have a responsibility to these girls . I have to show my niece what her fianc is like . I have to show her this odd thing  --  this one little unfortunate thing about the Ostermans . PAUL I see , Mr. Blake . BLAKE I 'm not only her uncle ; I 'm her guardian ; and her lawyer . I 'm all she 's got . And I must show her  --  here she comes now  --  and for that I need your help . ( Enter Diana Colvin , twenty-one , in furs . The finest girl in the world . ) COLVIN Here you are , Uncle Edward .  --  Good afternoon , Paul . PAUL Good afternoon , Miss Colvin . BLAKE Will you wait for tea , Diana ? COLVIN ( Crossing the stage to the bench : ) Yes . ( Paul goes out . ) BLAKE Are n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm furious at you . I 'm so furious I could cry . You 've humiliated me . I 'm so ashamed I do n't know what to do . Uncle Edward , how could you do such a thing ? p. 6 BLAKE ( Calmly : ) What , dear ? COLVIN I 've just heard that  --  ( She rises and strides about , groping for a handkerchief in her bag )  --  you 're asking the Osterman family how much allowance Roger will give me when we 're married . And you 're making some sort of difficulty about it . Uncle Edward ! The twentieth century ! And as though I were some poor little goose-girl he 'd discovered in the country . Oh , I could die . I swear to you , I could die . BLAKE ( Still calmly : ) Sit down , Diana . ( Silence . She walks about , dabs her eyes and finally sits down . ) Diana , I 'm not an idiot . I do n't do things like this by whim and fancy . COLVIN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep telling their readers every morning that I 'm one of the richest girls in the country . Is it true ? ( He shrugs ) I 'll never need a cent of the Ostermans ' money . I 'll never take a cent , not a cent . BLAKE What ? COLVIN I wo n't have to . BLAKE What kind of marriage is that ? ( He rises . She looks at him a little intimidated . ) Well , you 'll be making an enormous mistake and it will cost you a lot of suffering . p. 7 COLVIN What do you mean ? BLAKE Marriage is a wonderful thing , Diana . But it 's relatively new . Twelve , maybe fifteen thousand years old . It brings with it some ancient precivilization elements . Hence , difficult to manage . It 's still trying to understand itself . COLVIN ( Shifting in her seat , groaning : ) Really , Uncle Edward ! BLAKE It hangs on a delicate balance between things of earth and things of heaven . COLVIN Oh , Lord , how long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no money of her own . All of it , if she had any , became her husband 's . Think that over a minute . Billions and billions of marriages where the wife had not one cent that she did n't have to ask for . You see : it 's important to us men , us males , us husbands that we supply material things to our wives . I 'm sorry to say it but we like to think that we own you . First we dazzle you with our strength , then we hit you over the head and drag you into our cave . We buy you . We dress you . We feed you . We put jewels on you . We take you to the opera . I warn you now  --  most seriously  --  do n't you start thinking that you want to be independent of your husband as a provider . You may be as rich as all hell , Diana , but you 've got to give Roger the impression every day that you thank him  --  thank him humbly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COLVIN ( Short pause ; curtly : ) I do n't believe you . BLAKE Especially Roger . ( Leaning forward ; emphatic whisper ) You are marrying into a very strange tribe . ( They gaze into one another 's eyes ) Roger is the finest young man in the world . I 'm very happy that you 're going to marry him . I think that you will long be happy  --  but you 'll only be happy if you know beforehand exactly what you 're getting into . COLVIN What are you talking about ? ( She rises and crosses the stage . ) I want some tea . BLAKE No , we do n't have tea until he comes . He is giving us tea . Please sit down . What am I talking about ? Diana , you 've been out with Roger to lunch and dinner many times , have n't you ? You 've gotten in and out of taxis with him . You 've arrived at railroad stations and had porters carry your bags , have n't you ? COLVIN Yes . BLAKE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such cases ? COLVIN What do you mean ? ( He gazes levelly into her eyes . She begins to blush slightly . Silence . ) BLAKE Then you have ? p. 9 COLVIN ( Uncandidly : ) What do you mean ? BLAKE Say it ! ( Pause . ) COLVIN ( Suddenly : ) I love him . BLAKE I know . But say what 's on your mind . COLVIN It 's a little fault . BLAKE How little ? COLVIN I can gradually correct him of it . BLAKE That 's what his mother thought when she married his father After you leave a restaurant do you go back and leave a dollar or two for the waiter , when Roger 's not looking ? Do you hear taxi drivers shouting indecencies after him as he walks away ? Have you seen him waste time and energy to avoid a very small expenditure ? COLVIN ( Rising , with her handbag and gloves , as though about to leave : ) I do n't want to talk about this any more . It 's tiresome ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was it but you who taught me never to talk about money , never to mention money . And now we 're talking about money in the grubbiest way of all  --  about tipping . And you 've been talking to the Osterman family about an allowance for me . I feel soiled . I 'm going for a walk . I 'll come back in twenty minutes . p. 10 BLAKE Good . That 's the way you should feel . But there 's one more thing you ought to know . Paul will help us . ( He goes to the entrance at the back , apparently catches Paul 's eye , and returns . ) COLVIN You 're not going to drag Paul into this ? BLAKE Who better ?  --  Now if you sit at ease , it will put him at ease . ( Enter Paul . ) PAUL Were you ready to order tea , Mr. Blake ? BLAKE No , we 're waiting for Mr. Osterman . You have n't seen him , have you ? PAUL No , I have n't . BLAKE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little matter you and I were discussing . You gave me permission to ask you a few questions about the professional life in the hotel here . PAUL If I can be of any help , sir . BLAKE The whole staff of waiters is accustomed to a certain lack of generosity on the part of the Osterman family . Is that true ? PAUL ( Deprecatingly : ) It does n't matter , Mr. Blake . We know that they give such large sums to the public in general p. 11 BLAKE Is this true of any other families ? PAUL Well uh there 's the Wilbrahams . ( Blake nods ) And the Farringtons . That is , Mr. Wentworth and Mr. Conrad Farrington . With Mr. Ludovic Farrington it 's the other way ' round . BLAKE Oh , so every now and then these families produce a regular spendthrift ? PAUL Yes , sir . BLAKE I see . Now , have the waiters a sort of nickname for these less generous types ? PAUL ( Reluctantly : ) Oh the younger waiters I would n't like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am about this . I wish you would , Paul . PAUL Well they call them " cement hands . " COLVIN ( Appalled : ) WHAT ? BLAKE ( Clearly : ) Cement hands .  --  What you mean is that they can give away thousands and millions but they can not put their fingers into their pockets for a quarter or a dime ? And , Paul , is it true that in many cases the wives of the Ostermans and Wilbrahams and Farringtons return to the table after a dinner or supper and leave a little something  --  to correct the injustice ? p. 12 PAUL Yes , Mr. Blake .  --  Mrs . but I wo n't mention any names sometimes sends me something in an envelope the next day . BLAKE Yes . PAUL Perhaps I should tell you a detail . In these last years , the gentlemen merely sign the waiter 's check . And they add a present for the waiters in writing . BLAKE That they can do . Well ? PAUL Pretty well . What they can not do  --  BLAKE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thank you . And have you noticed that one of these hosts as the moment approaches to ( He puts his hands gropingly in his pockets ) he becomes uncomfortable in his chair his forehead gets moist ? PAUL Yes , sir . BLAKE He is unable to continue conversation with his friends ? Some of them even start to quarrel with you ? PAUL I 'm sorry to say so . BLAKE ( Shakes Paul 's hand : ) Thank you for helping me , Paul . PAUL Thank you , sir . ( Paul goes out . Diana sits crushed , her eyes on the ground . Then she speaks earnestly : ) p. 13 COLVIN Why is it , Uncle Edward ? Explain it to me ! How can such a wonderful and generous young man be so mean in little things ? BLAKE Your future mother-in-law was my wife 's best friend . Katherine Osterman has given her husband four children . She runs two big houses  --  a staff of twenty at least . Yet every expenditure she makes is on account  --  it goes through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checks for everything . You would not believe the extent to which she has no money of her own  --  in her own hand . Her husband adores her . He ca n't be absent from her for a day . He would give her hundreds of thousands in her hands but she must ask for it . He wants that picture : that everything comes from him . Why , she has to go to the most childish subterfuges to get a little cash  --  she buys dresses and returns them , so as to have a hundred dollars in bills . She does n't want to do anything underhand , but she wants to do something personal  --  small and friendly and personal . She can give a million to blind children , but she ca n't give a hundred to her maid 's daughter . ( Diana , weeping , blows her nose . ) Now you say you have your own money . Yes , but I want to be sure that you have an allowance from Roger that you do n't have to account to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ housekeeper or as a beautifully dressed Osterman or as an important philanthropist  --  but as an imaginative human being ; and I want that money to come from your husband . It will puzzle him and bewilder him and distress him . But maybe he will come to understand the principle of the thing . p. 14 COLVIN ( Miserably : ) How do you explain it , Uncle Edward ? BLAKE I do n't know . I want you to study it right here today . Is it a sickness ? COLVIN ( Shocked : ) Uncle Edward ! BLAKE Is it a defect in character ? COLVIN Roger has no faults . BLAKE Whatever it is , it 's deep  --  deep in the irrational . For Roger it 's as hard to part with twenty-five cents as it is for some people to climb to the top of a skyscraper , or to eat frogs , or to be shut up with a cat . Whatever it is  --  it proceeds from a fear , and whatever it is , it represents an incorrect relation to  --  COLVIN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul appears at the entrance . ) PAUL Mr. Osterman has just come into the hall , Mr. Blake . BLAKE Thank you , Paul . ( Paul goes out . ) COLVIN Incorrect relation to what ? BLAKE To material things  --  and to circumstance , to life  --  to everything . ( Enter Roger Osterman , twenty-seven , in a rush . The finest young fellow in the world. ) p. 15 OSTERMAN Diana ! Joy and angel of my life . ( He kisses her ) Uncle Edward .  --  Ten minutes past five . I 've got to make a phone call . To Mother . I 'll be back in a minute . Mother and I are setting up a fund . I 'll tell you all about it . Uncle Edward , what are you feeding us ? BLAKE We have n't ordered yet . We were waiting for our host . OSTERMAN ( All this quickly : ) Am I your host ? Very well . You 've forgotten that you invited us to tea . Did n't he , Diana ? BLAKE You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Diana , we ca n't let him run away from his responsibilities like that . Uncle Edward , we accept with pleasure your kind invitation  --  BLAKE You called me and told me to convey your invitation to Diana . Diana , thank Roger for his kind invitation . COLVIN ( Rising , with a touch of exasperation : ) Gentlemen , gentlemen ! Do be quiet . The fact is I planned this party and you 're both my guests . So do your telephoning , Roger , and hurry back . OSTERMAN You 're an angel , Diana . Tea with rum in it , Uncle Edward . COLVIN Come here , you poor , poor boy . ( She looks gravely into his eyes and gives him a kiss ) p. 16 OSTERMAN ( Laughing : ) Why am I a poor , poor boy ? COLVIN Well , you are . ( She gives him a light push and he goes out laughing . ) BLAKE We must act quickly now . I 've arranged for some things to happen during this hour . You 're going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some chocolate from a chocolate eclair . COLVIN What ? ! BLAKE And you 'll have to go to the ladies ' room to clean it up . And you 're going to need fifty cents . Open your purse . Give me all the change you have  --  under a five dollar bill . COLVIN Why ? BLAKE Because you 'll have to borrow the fifty-cent piece from him .  --  Give me your change . COLVIN Uncle Edward , you 're a devil . ( But she opens her handbag and purse ) BLAKE ( Counting under his breath : ) Three quarters . Fifty-cent piece . Dimes . No dollar bills . COLVIN ( Crossing the room , in distress : ) Uncle , I do n't believe in putting people to tests . BLAKE Simply a demonstration  --  p. 17 COLVIN I do n't need a demonstration . I suffer enough as it is . BLAKE But have you forgotten : we 're trying to learn something . Is it a sickness or is it a  --  COLVIN Do n't say it ! BLAKE And I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in conversation ( He starts laughing . ) COLVIN ( Suspicious and annoyed : ) What ? BLAKE To call your attention to it , I 'll ( He drops his purse ) drop something . Every subject that comes up in the conversation will have some sort of connection with money . COLVIN ( Angrily drops her handbag : ) But that 's all you and I have been talking about  --  until I 'm about to go crazy . BLAKE Yes yes , it 's contagious . COLVIN ( With weight : ) Uncle Edward , are you trying to break up my engagement ? BLAKE ( With equal sincerity , but quietly : ) No ! I 'm trying to ratify it to save it . COLVIN How ? p. 18 BLAKE ( Emphatic whisper : ) With understanding . ( Enter Paul . ) Oh , there you are , Paul . Tea for three and a decanter of rum . And a chocolate eclair for Miss Colvin . COLVIN But I hate chocolate eclairs ! ( Blake looks at her rebukingly . ) Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've finished tea , you 'll place the check beside Mr. Osterman . ( Diana purposefully drops her lipstick . ) PAUL ( Picking up the lipstick : ) Yes , sir . COLVIN Thank you , Paul . ( Paul goes out . Diana leans toward Blake and says confidentially : ) Now you must play fair . If you cheat , I 'll stop the whole thing . ( Enter Roger . ) OSTERMAN All is settled . It 's really very exciting . Mother and I setting up a fund where there 's a particular particular need . COLVIN What is it , Roger ? OSTERMAN ( Laughs ; then : ) Guess where Mother and I are going tomorrow ? COLVIN Where ? p. 19 OSTERMAN To the poorhouse ! ( Blake pushes and drops the ashtray from the table . ) COLVIN ( Covering her ears : ) Uncle Edward , do be careful ! OSTERMAN In fact , we 're going to three . Mother 's already been to thirty  --  in England and France and Austria  --  I 've been to ten . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attractive . Lots of people come to the ends of their lives without pensions , without social security . We 're taking the curse off destitution . BLAKE And you 're taking the curse off superfluity . ( Diana looks at Blake hard and drops her gloves . ) OSTERMAN We 're beginning in a small way . Mother 's giving two million and Uncle Henry and I are each giving one . We 're not building new homes yet  --  we 're improving the conditions of those that are there . Everywhere we go we ask a thousand questions of superintendents , and of the old men and women And do you know what these elderly people want most ? ( He looks at them expectantly ) COLVIN ( Dropping a shoe : ) Money . OSTERMAN ( Admiringly : ) How did you know ? ! ( Diana shrugs her shoulders . ) You see , in a sense , they have everything : shelter , clothes , food , companionship . We 've scarcely found one who wishes to leave the institution . But they all want the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul enters with a tray : tea ; rum ; eclair ; the service check , which he places on the table beside Roger ; and a letter. ) p. 20 PAUL A letter has come for you , Mr. Osterman , by special messenger . Will you sign for it , Mr. Osterman ? OSTERMAN For me ? But no one else knows that I 'm here . BLAKE By special messenger , Paul ? PAUL Yes , Mr. Blake . BLAKE And is the messenger waiting ? ( Intimately ) Roger the messenger 's waiting in the hall OSTERMAN What ? BLAKE Fifty cents for the messenger . OSTERMAN ( A study : ) But I do n't think this is for me . ( He looks at it . ) COLVIN ( Taking it from him : ) " Roger Osterman , Georgian Room , etc . " Yes , I think it 's for you . ( Roger makes some vague gestures toward his pockets . ) OSTERMAN Uncle Edward lend me a quarter , will you ? BLAKE ( Slowly searching his pockets : ) A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , give the boy a quarter , will you ? p. 21 PAUL ( Deaf as a post : ) Hot water ? Yes , Mr. Osterman  --  OSTERMAN ( Loud : ) No a QUARTER , Paul give the boy a quarter PAUL It 's right here , Mr. Osterman . OSTERMAN ( Has torn the letter open ; to Blake : ) It 's from you . You say you 'll be here . Well , if the messenger boy is from your own office , you can give him a quarter . BLAKE ( Smiting his forehead ; gives quarter to Paul : ) That 's right Paul I 'll see you OSTERMAN ( Dabbing his forehead with his handkerchief : ) My , it 's hot in here . COLVIN Roger  --  you were saying that these old people wanted money . They have everything provided , but they still want money . OSTERMAN Yes , I suppose it 's to give presents to their nephews and nieces to one another They have everything except that ( He starts laughing ; then leans forward confidentially and says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mother became so interested in all this was ( Then he stops , laughs again , and says ) Anyway , she 's interested . p. 22 COLVIN What were you going to say ? OSTERMAN ( Reluctantly : ) Well she 's always had the same kind of trouble . ( The other two stare at him ) Do you know that Mother once pawned a diamond ring ? BLAKE Your mother went to a pawnshop ? OSTERMAN No . She sent her maid . Even today she does n't know that I know .  --  I was at boarding school , and I 'd begun a collection of autographs . More than anything in the world I wanted for my birthday a certain letter of Abraham Lincoln that had come on the market . I could n't sleep nights I wanted it so bad . But Father thought it was unsuitable that a fifteen year old should get so worked up about a thing like that .  --  So Mother pawned her ring . ( Diana rises and crosses the room . She is flushed and serious . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such things  --  but  --  let me ask one thing , Roger . Your mother has always had a great deal of money of her own ? OSTERMAN ( Laughing : ) Yes . But , of course , Father keeps it for her . More than that : he 's doubled and tripled it . BLAKE Of course . It passes through his hands . p. 23 OSTERMAN Yes . BLAKE ( Looking at Diana : ) He sees all the checks . Like the old people in the poorhouse , your mother has everything except money ? OSTERMAN ( Laughing : ) Exactly !  --  The other thing the old people are interested in is food  --  COLVIN ( Looking down at her dress : ) Oh ! I 've spilled some of that tea and rum on my dress . I must go to the ladies ' room and have the spot taken out . Uncle Edward , lend me half a dollar for the attendant . BLAKE ( Ransacking his pockets : ) Half a dollar ! Half a dollar !  --  I told you I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and poorhouses  --  you never have any choice  --  COLVIN Roger , lend me half a dollar . OSTERMAN ( Taking out his purse , as he talks : ) That was the awful part about prep school  --  all the food  --  ( He hands Diana a ten-dollar bill and goes on talking )  --  was , so to speak , assigned to you . You never had the least voice in what it would be . COLVIN But I do n't want ten dollars . I want fifty cents . p. 24 OSTERMAN What for ? COLVIN To give the attendant in the ladies ' room . OSTERMAN Fifty cents ? ( Rising and inspecting her dress ) I do n't see any stain . ( To Blake ) Borrow it from Paul . BLAKE Paul 's deaf . Roger , put your hands in your pockets and see if you have n't got fifty cents . COLVIN ( Almost hysterically : ) It 's all right . The stain 's gone away . Forget it , please . Forgive me . I 've made a lot of fuss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his handkerchief : ) Awfully warm in here . We ought to have gone to the club . These places are getting to be regular traps . Why did we come here ? COLVIN What do you mean : traps ? OSTERMAN You 're interrupted all the time  --  these tiresome demands on you . I love to give , but I do n't like to be held up ( Gesture of putting a revolver to someone 's head ) held up every minute . ( A touch of too much excitement ) I 'd like to give everything I 've got . I do n't care how I live ; but I do n't like to be forced to give anything . It 's not my fault that I have money . p. 25 COLVIN You 're right , Roger . ( She sees Paul 's service check on the table . She flicks it with her finger and it falls on the floor as near the center of the stage as possible . ) I do n't think of a tip as an expression of thanks . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our waiter , Paul . My thanks is in my smile , so to speak . The money on the table has nothing to do with it . OSTERMAN Well , whatever it is , it 's a mess . BLAKE Once upon a time there was a very poor shepherd . It was in Romania , I think . COLVIN Uncle ! BLAKE Every morning this shepherd led his sheep out to a field where there was a great big oak tree . COLVIN Really , Uncle ! BLAKE And one day  --  under that oak tree  --  he found a large gold piece . The next day he found another . For weeks , for months , for years  --  every day  --  he found another gold piece . He bought more sheep . He bought beautiful embroidered shirts . ( Diana is suddenly overcome with uncontrollable hysterical laughing . She crosses the room , her handkerchief to her mouth , and sits on the bench by the windows . Blake waits a moment until she has controlled herself . ) No one else in the village seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment . Blake lowers his voice mysteriously . ) The shepherd 's problem was : Where do they come from ? And why are they given to him ? Are they , maybe supernatural ? p. 26 OSTERMAN ( Sharply : ) What ? ( Blake points to the ceiling . ) I do n't understand a word of this . Uncle Edward , do get on with it . I 've never been able to understand these allegories . BLAKE But why to him ? Was he more intelligent  --  or more virtuous than the other young men ? ( Pause . ) Now when you find a gold piece every morning , you get used to it . You get to need them . And you are constantly haunted by the fear that the gold pieces will no longer appear under the oak tree . What  --  oh , what  --  can he do to insure that those blessed gold pieces will continue to arrive every morning ? ( Blake 's voice turns slightly calculatedly superstitious ; he half closes his eyes , shrewdly . His blade-like hand describes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd better give . In return , so to speak . He gave his town a fine hospital . He gave a beautiful altar to the church . ( He changes his voice to the simple and direct ) Of course , he gave . But this shepherd was a fine human being , and it was the other question that troubled him most  --  frightened him , I mean : Why have I been chosen ? COLVIN ( Sober ; her eyes on the floor : ) I see that : he became frightened . p. 27 OSTERMAN ( Looking at Diana , in surprise  --  laughing : ) You understand what he 's talking about ? COLVIN Frightened , because if the gold pieces stopped coming , he 'd not only be poor he 'd be much more than poor . He 'd be exposed . He 'd be the man who was formerly fortunate , formerly  --  what did you say ?  --  intelligent , formerly virtuous and  --  BLAKE ( Pointing to the ceiling : ) Formerly favored , loved .

COLVIN ( Pointing : ) Right there on the floor . OSTERMAN ( Picking it up : ) I 'll sign for it .  --  Where 's Paul ? There he is ! p. 28 COLVIN ( Putting on lipstick and watching him in her mirror : ) Surely , it 's not large enough to sign for . There 's something small about signing for a three or four dollar charge . OSTERMAN ( Looking from one to the other : ) I do n't think so . BLAKE Diana 's right . OSTERMAN ( Taking a ten-dollar bill from his purse and laying it on the bill : ) Diana , some day you must explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Enter Paul . Roger indicates the money with his head .

OSTERMAN ( While he talks , is feverishly figuring out his change : ) Because I must be very stupid I ca n't ( His hand among the coins of change , he turns and says ) Because I must say there are lots of better things to talk about than what we 've been ( He stops while he studies the change before him ) In fact , in our family we make it a rule never to talk about money at all ( Pause . ) I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life is enough of a hell as it is : the only way I can cope with it is to never talk about it what am I doing here ? p. 29 COLVIN ( Going toward him ; soothingly : ) What 's the matter , dear ?

( Triumphantly ) I 'm going to leave him fifty cents , just to show him I love you . COLVIN No . I 'm not an angel . I 'm a very human being . I 'll need to be fed . And clothed . And  --  OSTERMAN ( Bewitched ; kissing her gravely : ) I 'll see you have everything . COLVIN I can look forward to everything ? OSTERMAN Yes .
