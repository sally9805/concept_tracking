THE FAMILY <P> While the rest of the world frets over the population explosion , the most recent statistics issued by the U.S. Public Health Service show that the U.S. birth rate is in a decline . The general fertility rate - the number of births per 1,000 women between the ages of 15 and 44 - was down to 104.0 v. 107.2 for the previous March . Furthermore , this drop continues a two-year trend . Only 337,000 live births were recorded in the month of March - 6,000 fewer than last year and the smallest total number for the month since 1955 . <P> <P> The Health Service was frankly baffled , pointing out that " the age composition of the female population , with increasing numbers of women entering the childbearing ages , is favorable to a higher level of fertility . " Unofficial guessers attributed the decline to World War II ( girls born in the 1946 baby boom are only now approaching the commonest marrying age ) and the introduction of oral contraceptives.            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
