In the nationalist point of view , foreign investors exploit local resources while stuffing huge profits in faraway pockets . It was no surprise then , when Guillermo Herrera Carrizosa , head of the Colombian government 's Development Corp. , early this year complained about companies taking more out of the country than they put in . He said that foreign businessmen operating in Colombia bring " little more than technique and a name , " charged that instead of increasing the needed inflow of dollars , they develop their profitable enterprises by borrowing from local financial institutions . <P> <P> Since the U.S. accounts for about 80% of all private foreign investment in Colombia , U.S. Ambassador Fulton Freeman decided to put the record straight . Over the next months , Freeman made a confidential survey of 90 big U.S. corporations doing business in the country . Recently , speaking before members of the Colombian-American Chamber of Commerce in Bogota , he presented the survey 's findings : <P> &gt; In the past five years , many of the 90 companies did not remit any dividends at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $29,3 million since 1957 , the companies sent only $8,050,000 in dividends back home . <P> &gt;The companies brought into the country eight times more capital than they raised from local financial institutions . They reported investments of $149 million , with only $18 million owed to Colombian lenders . <P> &gt; They created jobs for another 16,000 Colombians . <P> More than a source of capital , said Freeman , foreign companies " bring ideas , managerial experience and invaluable technical know-how . They bring competition-when permitted to do so-that stimulates the local entrepreneurs . They provide employment , they stimulate complementary industries , they pay taxes , and they create new exports or substitutes for imports . "
