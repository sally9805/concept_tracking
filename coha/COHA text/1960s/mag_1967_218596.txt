Under a law passed in 1940 , Polish-born Painter Beys Afroyim forfeited his U.S. citizenship by voting in a 1951 Israeli election . Not so , argued Afroyim all the way up to the Supreme Court . Last week the court upheld him-and thereby made it possible , in effect , for Americans to hold dual citizenship . <P> Until recently , Americans could lose citizenship for anything from treason to revolution to serving in a foreign army or government . In 1963 , on procedural grounds , the Supreme Court threw out a provision withdrawing citizenship from those who flee the country in wartime to escape the draft . In 1964 it exempted naturalized Americans who return to their native countries for three or more years . <P> In 1958 the court upheld the law against foreign voting as a reasonable exercise of Congress 's power over foreign affairs . But last week the court changed its mind , thus taking the rare step of overruling itself and voiding an act of Congress in the same decision . " Our Constitution , " wrote Justice Hugo Black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or those that are necessary and proper to carry out the specifically granted ones . " The 14th Amendment " citizenship clause " says only that all native-born or naturalized Americans are U.S. citizens-period . " The Government is without power to rob a citizen of his citizenship , " ruled Black . Therefore , even if an American joins the North Viet Nam army , he apparently retains U.S. citizenship-unless he specifically and voluntarily renounces it .
