THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment AYOUNG man who works as a messenger in our office building has a habit that reminds us of the persistence , in an era of dynamic change , of nostalgia for a time before one 's own . When he rides in the elevators , which were converted to self-service enough years ago to date back to the young man 's grade-school days , he pretends to he the operator . " Fourteen ! " he will call out , in a voice of authority , seeing that the fourteenth-floor button is the next one lighted , as a result of its having been pushed by someone who wants to get out there . " Watch your step as you leave the car , please . Fifteen is next . " His situation as he thus reenacts a vanished role is more or less analogous to that of Victorian children who played King Arthur and his knights , or of men in the nineteen-thirties who occasionally liked to imagine themselves at the wheel of a Stanley Steamer . The march @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fantasy . We can expect a generation that will fulfill its atavistic dreams of glory by going through a pantomime of hanging out a line of wash or dialling a telephone number . Library Lunch OUR good neighbor the Public Li-ke/ brary has been giving a series of what it calls Neighbors ' Lunches , " to make the many services of the Central Research Library better known to our industrial and professional community , " and we attended one of these on the kind invitation of David A. Shepard , a retired executive vice-president of Standard Oil of New Jersey who is a Library trustee . The event took place in the trustees ' room , a big room on the second floor , where some fifty guests were greeted by Mr. Shepard and Edward G. Freehafer , the director of the Library . We circled the room during the cocktails and took in such fixtures as a marble bust of John Jacob Astor , a Library founder , and portraits of George Washington and Benjamin Franklin , by Rembrandt Peale and Joseph S. Duplessis , respectively , together with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Farewell Address that Washington delivered to the printer ( the Library owns the full complement of thirty-two pages ) , Thomas Jefferson 's personal daily memorandum and account book covering the years between 1791 and 1803 ( opened to an entry of " Charity-4d " ) , a Lincoln letter granting a pardon to a seventeenyear-old Civil War soldier , Brown Brothers ' Gold Book No. 1 ( 1863-64 ) , a manuscript page of Washington Irving 's " Knickerbocker 's History of New York " ( Irving was an executor of Astor 's will and the first president of the board of trustees of the Astor Library ) , the original manuscript of Theodore Dreiser 's " Sister Carrie , " which was a gift from H. L. Mencken , and a first edition of Barbara Tuchman 's " The Guns of August . " " The rug in this room was given by Mrs. Vincent Astor , " said Mr. Robert W. Hill , Keeper of Manuscripts , as we sat down at a table embellished with flowers , pink king-crab cocktails , and two-way robin's-egg-blue place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ craning of the neck . " You ca n't see the floor underneath , but it 's a beautiful piece of parquetry work . " Roast beef , asparagus , and braised celery followed , and another Library neighbor , Mr. E. Lawrence Good man , a vice-president of Stern Brothers , said that until recently he had supposed that the Library was entirely supported by the city or state . " The Central Research Library is a private non-profit corporation , unusual among libraries , " Mr. Freehafer presently said , rising at another of the tables . " We have eighty-one neighborhood branches , from Woodlawn , in the north Bronx , to Tottenville , on Staten Island . The branch libraries circulate thirteen million volumes annually , at a cost of thirteen million dollars , supplied by the city and the state . Our research library is unique . University libraries serve a restricted clientele , but we serve the public at large . So does the Library of Congress , but it 's government-controlled . Our budget last year was seven and a half million dollars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have a deficit , but so far we 've been unwilling to curtail service . " Mr. James W. Henderson , the Library 's research chief , got to his feet and stated that the Library had three and a half million visitors a year , that its vast collections of First 1A-orld War material had enabled Mrs. Tuchman to do her research on " The Guns of August , " and that the institution owned the manuscript of a Mark Twain novel , " Simon Wheeler , Detective , " that had never been issued until the Library published it in 1963 . " It 's not very good , " he said , " hut much of it provided source material for ' Huckleberry Finn . ' " " I speak for the special collections , " Mr. Hill said , after getting up . " Many come from generous donors , like the George Arents Tobacco Collection and the Henry W. Berg and Albert A. Berg Collection of English and American Literature . We call a manuscript anything that is written by hand , even on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm going to try to create an image of America . Our Brown Brothers ' Gold Book will contribute to that . It documents Civil War gold transactions with London firms like Brown , Shipley ; J. Henry Schroder ; and N. M. Rothschild . " After lunch , brief tours , partly behind the scenes , were led by the Messrs . Henderson and Hill and other departmental heads . We trailed along with the Keeper of Manuscripts through Delivery and Shipping , Procurement , Receiving , Mail , and Card Preparation , then traversed a two-block-long , marble-floored corridor of stacks , and paused , finally , in the Main Reading Room , to which we were no stranger . " flow long does it take for a hook to get up here from the stacks ? " one of our number asked . " Fifteen to twenty minutes , " said Mr. Hill . " What ? " said his questioner , a midtown merchant . " Sometimes longer , " Mr. Hill said . " We would hope for fifteen minutes . " On our way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trustees ' room , and saw that the temporary exhibit was being dismantled . ? OVERHEARD on the corner of Fifth Avenue and Forty-seventh Street , one miniskirt to another : " Sally never realizes the import of what he 's saying until she realizes there is n't any . " Parrot Show THE art world is sometimes more simpleminded than it seems . " Last December , I did a ' Mono Imagists ' exhibition , showing artists who arc concerned with a single image , " Mr. Arne H. Ekstrom , of the Cordier &; Ekstrom Gallery , in the Parke-Bernet building , told us a couple of weeks ago when we ran into him at an avant-garde dinner party . " The show consisted of fifteen paintings and sculptures by Jennett Lam , who paints only chairs ; Peter Dechat , who paints only pears ; and Tornio Miki , who sculptures only his left ear . This gave me the idea of having a ' Poly Imagists ' show this December , but that did n't seem specific enough . So my imagination took a further small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ? parrots , that is . I suggested that to my artists last winter , and most of them came through with an appropriate piece of work . To announce the show , I got out a poster that said ' Polly Imagists , ' with two Ts . I suppose some of its recipients thought I just did n't know how to spell . " Mr. Ekstrom smiled , and invited us to visit the exhibit . We dropped in the following morning , and found that two of his 1966 Mono Imagists , without precisely losing their franchise , had obligingly turned into Polly , Imagists pro tem  --  Mrs. Lam , who was represented by a chair in the shape of a parrot , and Mr. Dcchar , who had contributed a large painting of a green pear that cast a shadow of a blue parrot . Other pally-depicters included Marvin Israel ( a naked woman , seated , with a dead parakeet tinder her ) , Richard Lindner ( a watercolor of a woman with a parrot , and a watercolor of a man holding a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman in the background ) , Joseph Cornell ( a wood-and-collage box containing a white parrot ) , Martin Carey an elaborate drawing of ten parrot heads and a great array of beak motifs ) , Alfonso Ossorio ( a sculptured and painted assemblage of a parrot head surrounded by a welter of beaks , glass eyes , hones , tusks , shells , and lobster claws ) , Saul Steinberg ( a drawing of a mustached , cigar-smoking man with a parrot on the top of his head ) , Robert Indiana ( an enormous green parrot surmounting the word " Parrot " ) , and a 1916-17 Man Ray of Mr. Ekstrom 's chosen bird . " I had this in my own collection , " he said , of the last . " Indiana had never done a parrot before  --  he generally does only lettering  --  but he told me that his grandmother had had one , and that he was glad to do this in her and the parrot 's memory . The Lam parrot chair is something of a departure , as Mrs. Lam usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dated 1966 ? fifty years after the one I already had . " The latter-day Man Ray was a collage parrot stuck on a roller-skated foot , with " le Diplomate " pencilled underneath . " I hope you 're not going to ask me why he calls it ' le Diplomate , ' because it 's beyond me , " Mr. Ekstrom said , and he led us to a cube by Arman that had a fernlike arrangement of feathers embedded in it . " This is a kind of maltiple pun , " he said . " The cube is made of polyester , and the object is called Tulypaon . " Paun ' is the French word for ' peacock . ' Those feathers arc really peacock feathers . " We spotted another exhibit that seemed to be non-pally  --  an onyx abstraction by Isamu Noguchi , mounted on a stainless-steel base . " Noguchi did n't quite do a parrot , " Mr. Ekstrom admitted . " It may be a bird , however . This cage was contributed by the gallery . " He indicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feathers , giving the impression of a Surrealistic parrot massacre ; the roof was thatched with more feathers . " I find the unity of the theme very amusing , " Mr. Ekstrom said . " Incidentally , my wife , Parmenia Migel , has just written a biography of Isak Dinc7sen , the novelist , and it 's a great success . Hollywood wants to make a movie of it . " We asked what the reaction to the show had been , and he said , " On the whole , enthusiastic . But a man came in the other day and , after looking around , said that he thought it was stupid and arbitrary . I said I would n't accept stupid , ' and he repeated the phrase , so I suggested that he should leave . " ? N the Delaware Memorial Bridge , 14. -1 signs reading " No Stopping on Bridge " alternate with signs reading " Be Prepared for Sudden Stops . " Arlo Guthrie ON a late afternoon recently , The Bitter End , a small , cellarlike night club on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hanging from a cord . The rows of tables and benches were all but empty , and it was very hot . On a low stage , a twenty-year-old folk singer named Arlo Guthrie stood by two microphones , holding his guitar . " We 'll do it once , " he said , in a quiet voice , half turning to a bass player and THE NEW YORKER 2 drummer who were just visible behind him in the shadows , " and if it 's groovy , it 's groovy . " He began an introduction on the guitar , the two men joined in , and the dark room was suddenly filled with music . In the dim light , Guthrie , standing with his head slightly bowed , looked she or seven years younger than twenty  --  his face long and childlike ( a sort of Skeezix drawn h5 Modigliani and curly black hair hanging down to his shoulders . About six feet tall , and thin , Ise was wearing a white undershirt and blue trousers , he had a dark scarf knotted around his neck , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were lying on the stage behind him ; his shirt had been tossed on top of an amplifier . " I do n't want a pickle , " he sang , in a plain voice with a slight drawl . " Just want to ride on my motorsickl e . " Outside , a poster facing the sidewalk of Bleecker Street announced the opening the next night of " ARLO GUTHRIE and ALICE 'S RESTAURANT , " the latter being a song , written and performed by Guthrie , that runs anywhere from eighteen to thirty-five minutes . An **32;3274;TOOLONG version of " Alice 's Restaurant " on Reprise Records has sold over a hundred thousand copies in the last three months , and in New York the song has especially ardent followers , who ca n't seem to hear enough of it . By last May , Station WBAI-FM had played a tape recording of it so many times and received so many requests to play it some more that the station  --  a non-profit one , dependent upon contributions  --  took advantage of its popularity during its annual fund-raising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the recording again until , say , a thousand dollars had been pledged by listeners ; generally , the money was pledged within a short time , and " Alice 's Restaurant " was heard once more . " Alice 's Restaurant " is full of contradictions . To begin with , it is not really a song  --  it 's a story , told against a nonchalant , cheerfully repetitive guitar background . It is nor solely about Alice or a restaurant  --  it is , superficially , a rambling account of how Guthrie got arrested for dumping a load of garbage in the wrong place in Stockbridge , Massachusetts , but it ends up ( say , half an hour later ) as a rallying cry for freedom and against war . The song is funny , personal , deft , surprising , and wild . Arlo Guthrie is the oldest of three children of the second marriage of the late Woody Guthrie , the classic figure in American folk music . A native of the Oklahoma Dust Bow who became a voice of the American conscience during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ y ears of his life in hospitals , suffering from a gradual and incurable paralysis , and died in 1967 ; during- a life of wandering and singing , he had written over a thousand songs , turning the folk song into a medium for social comment and protest , and he remains a compelling influence on the present generation of folk singers . Inside The Bitter End , as the motorsickle song ended , Guthrie said softly , reflectively , " Yeah . " Then there was a brief , casual conversation with the bass player ( " Are you going to do those goin ' - down things ? " ) and the drummer ( " On the break , just sit there and look groovy . Otherwise , it looks like you missed " ) , after which Guthrie took a puff on a cigarette and a gulp of a soft drink and began a rollicking song of his called " RingAround-a-Ross ' Rag , " about a clash with authority in Philadelphia 's Rittenhouse Square ( " I had a friend Friend I could trust He went into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rag " ) . Then Guthrie put down his guitar , went to a piano , and played a melancholy song called " Now and Then . " " Ado , do ' Summer Wind , ' " said a young and pretty blonde , with an English . accent , who was sitting close to the stage . Guthrie complied , and then said , " Oh , I wrote a thing today that is really groovy . How 'd it go ? " He found it and played it , and the bass player  --  an amiahle , heavyset young man with a beard said , " It sounds like a cross between Mozart and Michel Le-grand . " The girl said , " It reminds vie of Lennon and McCartney . " Guthrie swerved into a barrelhouse version of the " Alice " theme and accompanied the bass player , who improvised an aria , and then Guthrie spun out an impromptu mock-hillbilly song ( " When 1 . was a little boy .. My mother said to me/ ' Would you like to play the guitar ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the world together , / Bumming cigarettes , / And now , thirty 2 0 JANUARY 6 , 9 6 8 y ears later , IA-re 're finally , separated " ) and , at the end , asked , " What time is it ? We better start cleaning up . We 've got to get out of here by seven . " He put on his shirt and pulled on his boots as some young men drifted into the club to begin rehearsing their act , which would appear on the bill with him . Then he said , " Well get down here early tomorrow afternoon again , and that 'll he groovy . " We said hello to Guthrie , and he introduced us to the English girl , who turned out to be named Can to his brother Toady , who had been sitting in the shadows ; and to the musicians . He invited us to join them all for dinner , and the six of us headed out onto Bleecker Street . NVe asked Guthrie how he had come to write " Alice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evolved of its own accord . It 's all true . The whole story about the garbage was in the Bcrkshirr Eagle . I did n't even write the song down until they said I had to copyright it . Music should evolve of itself , and ' Alice 's Restaurant ' is a culmination of everything I was thinking about . It 's exciting to write for a time that 's really happening . " He paused . " It gets funnier and funnier , " he said . " I hear the police chief in Stockbridge has been autographing photographs of the garbage . " - We went into a restaurant near The Bitter End , pushed a couple of tables together , and sat down . There was a lot of cheerful talk and laughter as everyone looked at the menu . " Ts Welsh rabbit in America the same thing as Welsh rabbit in England ? " Carol inquired . Nobody seemed to know . Guthrie , close up , did look twenty years old ; his face is somewhat ascetic and contained but often amused . Fie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a quiet way , and to hope for the same approach from others ; his songs reflect this quality . During the discussion about the menu , someone mentioned Nathan 's hot-dog stand in Coney Island , and Guthrie said he had spent his childhood there . We asked him about it , and he told us he was horn in Coney . Island , around the corner from Nathan 's . " We used to get up at six in the morning , " he said , " and my father used to put my sister , my brother , and me in this old carriage , when we could n't walk through the snow , and he 'd push us over to Nathan 's , and we 'd have French fries ? ' hot patnoties , ' we called them  --  so my mother could clean up the house . Then , when we gut back , the house would he cool . " The family moved to Howard Beach , in Queens , when Arlo was six . " It was just swamp around where we lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swamp , " he said . " I grew up in a very free atmosphere , within the limits of what was groovy and what was n't . " The Guthrie house was always full of music , and musicians were always dropping by . He remembers seeing Bob Dylan for the first time when Dylan turned up , unannounced , at the door . " I was about thirteen . He came to our house in Queens , and just walked in , " he told us . " He was looking for Woody . Woody was n't there , and my mother was away , and there was a baby-sitter for my brother and sister . She was really . frightened . But I dug him , because of his groovy walking shoes . He had those high , lace-up engineer boots . Well , he split about an hour later , though everybody except me wanted him to split right then . During the hour , he taught me the harp . I dug him . I was already like that , but I guess I needed encouragement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Folk Festival in 1964 . He gave ine his pass to get in , sn I got in , but then they would n't let him in . He thought that was really groovy . " Guthrie laughed . We asked him if he remembered the first time he had sung for an audience . He thought for a moment , and then said , " I guess it was at Gerde 's Folk City , when I was around ten . Cisco Houston brought me up on the stage , and I was so scared my hands were trembling and my knees were trembling , I sang ' Pastures of Plenty ' Woody 's song . " Guthrie went to hoarding school in Stockbridge For four years , and attended music camps in the summer . On weekends during the winter , he and his friends used to go up into the- mountains behind the school and build secret cabins . " We built a whole community up there , with a constitution that had only one rule : You ca n't build your cabin in sight of anyone else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful about the whole scene . I built four cabins , half buried in the ground , and camouflaged , waterproof , snowproof . We had stoves and the whole thing . One cabin was one and a half stories . It was like an outlet from school  --  an exit . Any school is like a prison . I 've always had to find a way to fit in but always leave a back door open . I think you should always leave an exit for people , no matter how dangerous the exit is ; otherwise , they ca n't function . " Guthrie matriculated at Rocky Mountain College , in Billings , Montana , but dropped out after six weeks . " I was n't getting anything out of it , " he said . " I was more into the early hippie thing , and they did n't know what to think of me . They 'd follow me down the street in single file , making remarks . I guess they thought I was a freaked-out kid they could study . The chaplain was the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I was already on the road . When other people wanted me to get involved in a ridiculous thing called reality , ' I said , ' Hey , that 's not for real . ' And now I 'm telling them . I think I found one that 's groovy for me . A sort of hippie way . It 's traditional American  --  the idea that you can do what you want as long as you do n't hurt anybody else doing it . Do what you want and do n't put anybody else up tight  --  that 's what I 'd like to do . And I do it as well as I can . " Guthrie returned to New York , and began singing professionally here and in England . He lives in Stockbridge now ( " I do n't dig the whole city scene , " he said . " The best part is that nobody bothers you personally , but it 's dirty , filthy , noisy " ) , because " I 've been up and down the East Coast and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Berkshires . It 's only a few thousand people . They have beautiful quarries to swim in , where you can swing on ropes and nobody goes . There 's skiing and skating , and ? you can run through the fields . I just go around and investigate things . " " What things we asked . " Anything that seems to he investigable , " he said cheerfully . He told us that there is a sizable hippie population in Stockbridge . " The community is in conflict with the hippie community right now , " he said . " When you walk into a restaurant , the people wo n't say hello , and it 's hard not to he hostile . But I think in four or five years everything will he very beautiful there . In the meantime , it 's kind of fun freaking people out , and fun when they realize where you 're at and they find it 's not so bad . " Guthrie lives in an old white farmhouse , with a varying number of oc cupants . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All we do is buy candles , " Carol said , laughing . Guthrie nodded . " We bought fifty bucks ' worth of candles , " he said . " And when you have fifty bucks ' worth of candles , you have to light ' em , because they look so beautiful . " They both laughed . " The hippie thing was misinterpreted by the people of this country , " Guthrie said , a moment later . " The hippies were saying , ' Love everybody , ' but the people were putting ' em down . The hippies ended up sitting in their rooms . People said , ' Why do they sit in their rooms ? ' Because nobody wants to be put down . The hippie thing is not over , but it 's changing . The gap is so wide between the love people and the hate people . America is going to pay dear for it . The best example is the Negro scene . None of it would have happened if people had treated people like people . America pays every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay every time somebody dies in Vietnam , or busts into somebody 's house . The way they really pay is when they walk on the street and nobody smiles . Most of ' em do n't know what happiness is . Somebody 's going to have to slow down , and somebody 's going to have to catch up . " Two years ago , Guthrie registered as a conscientious objector , but he was turned down and is now classified 1-A . We asked him what he expects will happen next . " I do n't know what 's going to happen , " he said . He paused . " But I wo n't go , " he continued . " There are a lot of things that are important to me , but I do n't want to talk about them . I 'm not a church type , but I 've been influenced by religion . Maybe it 's the way I was brought op , but I feel like I have sonic kind of responsibility . I got the word . The problem is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People have to work it out together . " A few minutes later , he said , " For me , the groovy times are when I discover things . Like when I discovered a C on a guitar is the same as a C on a piano . That was a beautiful thing . I like to travel by myself , go out and see what 's happening . I just want to see . I 'm still kind of investigating . But I really believe what I 'm doing is my real thing . People like it when you 're yourself . There are a lot of people who find themselves and think it 's not groovy  --  they 're not given chance enough , or they do n't have the stubbornness to stick with it . But I dig to do my thing . "
