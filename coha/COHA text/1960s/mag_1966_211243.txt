In Lyndon Johnson 's proud prejudgment , historians will record it as " The Great Congress . " And so they may . But few would claim that the 89th 's finest hours came in 1966 . After a historic first session that passed 105 important bills , the Congress generally thumb-twiddled its way through its second session , only to burst into a fevered eleventh-hour blur of action that added little to its luster . <P> By voice vote both houses last week slammed through minor bills en masse . Probing questions about important legislation were often brusquely slapped down . When the week began , only seven of 13 annual appropriations bills had been passed ; when it was over , all had been hustled through the assembly line . On one key measure , the Senate voted in the absence of 30 members , most of whom had left to fight home-state campaign battles . Lamenting the proportionate absence of deliberation on the Senate floor , Vermont Republican George Aiken remarked : " I 've never seen the Senate act more irresponsibly . " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bill that created the U.S. 's twelfth Cabinet agency , the Department of Transportation . Swayed as much by the exigencies of leaving town and lobbyists ' pressures as by legislative logic , the Congress in effect ignored sea transport , voted to keep the Maritime Administration out of DOT and leave the agency in its present autocratic limbo within the Department of Commerce . The President strongly disapproved of Congress ' inaction on the Maritime Administration , but he signed the bill at week 's end . <P> Both houses also zipped through the $58,067,472,000 defense-appropriations bill , which includes-for no ascertainable reason-a rider that gives the President the unrequested power to activate some 1,000,000 military reservists without first declaring a national emergency . Senate Minority Leader Everett Dirksen even managed to insert an amendment in a public-works bill that authorizes the President to impound 20% of the funds Congress allows for domestic programs because of the " unpredictability " of the war in Viet Nam . The Senate approved it , even though it was simply a Dirksen exercise in oneupmanship . If the House agrees , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ congressionally appropriated funds , will in consequence have more trouble repeating his favorite alibi that larger expenses are the fault of Congress . <P> Along with all its last-minute lapses , the 89th last week managed to come up with final votes on only a few other major measures-notably a $4.1 billion public-works measure and a $186 million bill to expand official efforts to combat air pollution . Preliminary floor action was taken on several other significant bills , but in every case , final resolution was left until this week-which is expected to be the 89th 's last .
