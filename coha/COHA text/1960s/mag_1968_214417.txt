AUTOMOBILES are costly to buy and to maintain . Although motor-happy Americans are buying more and more of them ( see following story ) , they have reason to cringe when it comes to repairing aged or ailing cars . As Economist William N. Leonard , a professor at Long Island 's Hofstra University , told a Senate Judiciary Subcommittee last week : " No matter where you go for auto repairs , you run the risk of a fleecing . The automobile-service business has become a jungle for the consumer . " <P> That harsh charge was echoed repeatedly during a three-day congressional hearing on the $25 billion-a-year auto-repair industry-a branch of U.S. business that collects an average $250 annually for each of the 100 million cars on U.S. roads . The public hearing followed an eight-month study that faulted the automakers and the nation 's 400,000 auto-service outlets for the high cost and low quality of maintenance . <P> Beating the Book . Among many horror stories uncovered in the investigation was that of a Houston real estate man , who complained that he bought a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dealer for repairs 27 times . Was the car defective or the repair work ineffective ? Probably both . Glenn F. Kriegel , operator of a Denver " diagnostic center " that inspects cars for signs of trouble but does no repairing itself , checked 7,000 cars after they had left service shops in his area ; less than 1% of them had been fixed properly , and some had not been repaired at all . Though Kriegel may have been overly critical-his testimony could only help the auto-diagnosing business-the findings were startling . <P> Auto service is a mess largely because of abuses in the system by which repair shops calculate labor costs . Under the prevailing piecework system , mechanics are paid a set rate for each job rather than an hourly wage . To figure the labor charge , garages rely on " flat-rate " manuals that specify how much time each job should take . Although automakers publish their own flat-rate manuals , many garages prefer to use independent books that list longer work times-and thus higher charges-for each job . Whatever the manual , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is generally split fifty-fifty between the mechanic and the garage owner . Thus both have reason to complete as many jobs as possible in less than the set time . <P> The subcommittee found that mechanics " beat the book " up to 75% of the time . One flat-rate manual , for example , puts the time for replacing rear springs on a 1965 Chevy II at 2 hr. 36 min. , though the work often takes less than 2 hr . Some mechanics , of course , are skillful enough to finish the job that fast . Others beat the book only by doing the work sloppily-or not at all . <P> Another reason for shoddy repairs is the shortage of skilled mechanics . Few men are eager to train for the tough , grimy job , in which the rewards ( an average base pay of about $150 weekly ) run considerably less than those for plumbers and painters , not to mention mechanics in the aircraft and other industries . As a result , many motorists have to wait as long for an appointment with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
