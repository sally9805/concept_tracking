txt WASHINGTON , Jan. ** necessity , Federal budgets are speculative ; hence this is true of President Johnson 's estimates of the dollars the Government will spend and receive in the next fiscal year . Also , political considerations , especially in a Presidential election year , are always reflected in the product  --  this time Mr. Johnson 's awareness that the Republicans hope to exploit the national anxiety over rapidly rising Federal spending as their best campaign issue of 1964 . With these factors acutely in mind , the President prepared budget and spending estimates in which the unavoidable element of speculative calculation was tempered by a statement of policy reversing the immediate Democratic past . The mood of the message was fiscally " conservative , " on the test of the eventual reckoning of costs and receipts . Its tone was one of strict frugality . But the program proposed was " liberal . " To ride these three horses at the same time , and pass the finishing post aboard them all , would be to ' achieve a balanced budget ; a prosperity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and maintain the security of the United States from all threats , for-1 eign and domestic , except those beyond human capacity to foresee or forestall . But , since this would be unique in the annals of statesmanship , many of those who doubt that the President can attain it ? even in the maximum of nine years he may occupy the White House  --  are not disparaging his sincerity in pledgingl a good , hard try or his earned reputation for following through . But the effort will require him to face up to some very hard choices he thus far has postponed . For instance , he has retained as the basis of his fiscal policy the huge tax cut plan of his predecessor , to be made in a rising cycle of Government spending and deficits . If meanwhile the tax cut does not prove the validity of its inherent theory that it will propel the economy upward and unemployment downward , inflation and greater rather than lesser Government spending will be the logical consequences . The ' Unexpended Balances ' Conclusive proofs of the Johnson pudding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact before the fiscal reckoning on June 30 , 1965 . But the President could explore one means of making the proof more positive by a thorough overhaul of the problem of the unexpended balances in the regular Federal budget accounts ( exclusive of trust funds ) . At the start of the current fiscal year these amounted to about $87 billion , of which $45 billion were still " unobligated " by spending or spending commitment . To put some restraint on these , Senator Byrd of Virginia has a pending proposal . It would require that annual appropriation bills not only provide for the new spending that is authorized by Congress , but also place an annual spending limit against each account with respect both to current authorizations and those in prior years . " These balances , " Senator Byrd explained today , " are not in the literal form of dollars on deposit awaiting out-payment . They are in fact simply unused authorizations to spend Federal funds . But they do represent existing legal authority for Federal agencies to obligate or spend funds , or both , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contracted against them . " Part of the problem they present is that they may have been enacted in a year when revenue and Treasury cash balance were high . But their expenditure may actually occur in a year when revenue and cash balance are low . " The arrangement is unavoidable for such spending authorizations as the construction of an aircraft carrier , which may take from three to five years . The same applies to the postal deficit and interest on the Federal debt . But the system is open to abuse . And it has been abused ? for example , by fuzzy and wasteful foreign aid contracts that were made only because the authority to commit the funds was about to expire . There are other loose situations the President will have to tighten if his goal is to be even within visibility by June 30 , 1965 . For one , the revenue estimate from tobacco products is beginning to look highly unrealistic . Unless his miracles come off , hard choices await him , though probably the most politically dangerous decisions will not have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
