txt Look for growing speculation on the future of Robert H. Finch . The Secretary of Health , Education , and Welfare was actually the President 's first choice as a running mate . But Mr. Nixon concluded that his longtime friend and political associate was not well known enough nationally in 1968 . Therefore , he moved elsewhere , finally selecting Spiro T. Agnew through a process of elimination . But 1972 will be another year and , quite possibly , a time for a new vice-presidential slating . Mr. Nixon knows that his running mate then will have the inside track on the GOP presidential nomination four years later . And it is known that the man Mr. Nixon would prefer over all others as his successor is Mr. Finch . Thus it is quite possible that Vice-President Agnew will be replaced by Mr. Finch as the Nixon running mate in 1972 . Should Congress turn thumbs down on the Safeguard ABM system , the military is ready with alternatives . It 's waiting in the wings with other proposals , including the Navy 's Sabmis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Navy will push Sabmis whether Safeguard is approved or not . It proposes to mount antiballistic missiles aboard ships , which could be moved about to provide concentrated defense along changing lanes of possible attack . So far Defense . Department officials are keeping Sabmis on the back burner . They are far less optimistic over the Air Force proposal to use Minuteman missiles as both offensive and defensive weapons . Technically , scientific sources say , this would be possible . But the Minuteman is not a very powerful missile . And its capabilities , they say , are far below what is needed . America 's funeral-reform movement has no notion of burying the hatchet . On the contrary , it has new cause for consternation : a bill before Congress to allow a tax write-off of up to $2,500 for funeral expenses . Its sponsor , Sen. Ted Stevens ( R ) of Alaska , says his measure has the . full backing of the nation 's undertaking industry . That 's logical , retort members of a fast-growing association of funeral and memorial societies opposed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stevens bill will only encourage undertakers to continue charging exorbitant fees , which often leave low-income survivors knee-deep in debt . In black ghettos especially such practices abound , according to a study made last year by the memorial-society reformers . It found that in Cleveland , for instance , the average black funeral cost between $1,500 and $2,000 . The average white funeral fee was $960 . By contrast , the simpler services approved by the memorial societies - often cost less than $200 . The " Save the Everglades " movement is getting an assist from a new direction . Senate Interior and Insular Affairs Committee aides say Sen. Henry M. Jackson ( D ) of Washington , the chairman , plans a day-long session next month on the growing problems of Florida 's Everglades National Park . Droughts have caused loss of wildlife in the 22-year-old park . Persistent poaching has shrunk its alligator population . Pesticides used on agricultural land have lowered the water quality and is resulting in yet undetermined damage to the park 's creatures . The latest hazard is the possibility of a major international @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ border . But the Everglades has its friends . Last month a coalition of conservation-minded organizations representing more than 3 million people formed an ad hoc group to fight the proposed airport . For years the National Audubon Society and National Parks Association have worked to preserve the nation 's only subtropical wilderness in its pristine state . How and why ... The Labor Department is irked no end that people keep calling all 30 of its planned training centers for youth ' " minicenters . " Actually , says Labor , only about 10 will be really small , handling some 30 youths each . Five or so will be able to house and train 350 youngsters . Each of the rest will accommodate up to 500 . Of the 60 Job Corps centers being closed , 47 are rural conservation centers with enrollments averaging fewer than 200 persons . But overall , the training program is being cut back . The 30 new centers will accommodate only 4,625 enrollees while the 60 being closed accommodate about 15,000.             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
