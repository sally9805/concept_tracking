Whatever else he did in his 88 flamboyant years , Daniel Edgar Sickles will be remembered for the way his troops were disposed on unprotected ground at the Battle of Gettysburg , and for the fact that he got shot . Civil War buffs still debate the merit of his deployment , but there is no question that the Confederate cannonball that smashed Sickles ' right leg helped to make U.S. medical history . After the leg was amputated , a Union medic showed Sickles a year-old circular that directed medical officers " diligently to collect , and -o forward to the office of the Surgeon General , all specimens of morbid anatomy , surgical or medical , which may be regarded as valuable . " <P> Major General Sickles promptly had his eg packed carefully in a coffinlike box and ent it , with his formal calling card bear ing the legend " Compliments of D.E.S .. " to the new Army Medical Museum in Washington . After pathologists had ex-mined the specimen , the bone was preserved .

Last week , as the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology celebrated : he centennial of its founding as the Army Medical Museum , tourists still admired an Sickles ' leg . They could also gape at a lock of Lincoln 's hair , a bone sliver from his skull , and bullet-shattered vertebrae from Assassin John Wilkes Booth and President James A. Garfield . But pathology , the study of disease processes , has far outgrown the two rear rooms above the Riggs Bank that first housed the Army Medical Museum . The institute , which is a combined effort of all three armed forces , now serves a score of civilian Government agencies ; it works closely with independent medical groups and individual doctors around the world . <P> <P> Unlike Sickles ' leg , the vast majority of the institute 's many specimens are not on view in its Independence Avenue museum ; they are housed in the working quarters at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center six miles away .

There are 12 million pieces that were removed at operations and fixed in paraffin , 14 million slices in slides for microscope study , and 1.1 million case histories . Since 1922 , the institute has collected and stored eyes that had to be removed because of disease . Fixed in formaldehyde , wrapped in gauze , and packed in numbered plastic bags is probably the world 's most comprehensive collection of hearts attacked by tumors . <P> Dyes &; Light . The institute 's members have made their own great contributions to pathology . In 1864 it was one of the old museum 's first pathologists , Dr. Joseph Janvier Woodward , who developed the use of newly discovered aniline dyes to stain tissues so that different components became more distinguishable . That same year Dr. Woodward took the first microscope photographs , using the sun as his light source .
