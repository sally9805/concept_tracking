txt This is the fourth of a series of excerpts from the new book , " The Hidden Russia , " an unvarnished account by Nikolai Krasnov Jr . of his 10 years in the notorious slave labor camps of Siberia . Krasnov was one of thousands of Russian expatriates who , under the terms of the Yalta agreement , were forced to return to the Soviet Union in 1945 . The MVD was waiting for him . His ordeal began in the cramped torture cells of Moscow 's Lubyanka and Lefortovo prisons . After three months of agonizing interrogations by MVD examiners , he was finally to learn his punishment for being an " enemy of the people . " Kraspov died in Argentina last year before the book was published . BY NIKOLAI KRASNOV JR . In September , the investigation of my offenses was finally ended . I was summoned before a magistrate . He looked over my case in the neat folder handed him by an examiner . " Krasnov , Junior . . . Nikolai . . . Hmmm . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word " species " made it sound insulting . " No matter how you feed a wolf , he still looks at the forest . . . . He 'll get 10 years in the correctional labor camps . It 's a pity . . . it 's too little . " It was my good luck to be sentenced in 1945 . The regular procedure was expressed in the words , " The supreme penalty , death by shooting , has been commuted to 10 years in the correctional labor camps . " But beginning in 1947 , and up to Stalin 's death in 1953 , the supreme penalty was " commuted " to 25 years of forced labor in the correctional labor camps . After going thru the familiar , odious , and painful " release " procedure , I was put in a solitary cage of a patrol wagon and taken to Moscow 's Butyrki prison . Butyrki prison is a prelude to the labor camps . Perhaps the regime here is lighter than in Lubyanka or Lefortovo , but its scope is larger . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , political prisoners . Here , for the first time , we came into contact with criminals . Butyrki is constantly overcr owde d , evidence of the great number of ordinary criminals . There was no segregation of prisoners in the cells . They were put in wherever there was space , common criminals along with the " kontriki , " the counter-revolutionaries sentenced under article 58 of the soviet criminal code . If there was no room , they made it by cramming , and there was no limit to the cramming . Plundering of Prisoners In Butyrki the unabashed plundering of the prisoners began . Not all of them came in without a toothbrush or clad in a tattered German uniform , as I did . Some arrived in fur coats , in well polished shoes , with a blanket and an extra set of underwear . During the first night , the criminals give the hapless newcomer " the works . " If he is a compliant fellow , the operation passes off without Incident . At most , they will " roll " him a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomes brutal and of ten ends in permanent maiming . His belongings are taken in either case . The best pieces go to the guard as his cut , and the others are gambled for in front of the victim . Fights for Boots Altho one might have thought I had nothing to lose , the criminals made an attempt to get hold of my tattered boots and the remnants of my breeches . I had been trained to box from childhood , so I immediately showed fight . One pirate came at me with a knife , but the second uppercut stretched him on the floor , after which he left me alone , muttering something to his companions in a jailbird jargon I could not understand . The next morning , the guard changed my cell . A month after his arrival in Butyrki , Krasnov 's 10 year sentence was confirmed by a trio of judges whom he never saw , and he was transferred once again ? to Moscow 's Krasnaya Presen prison . His father , grown too weak to travel , was imprisoned elsewhere , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I felt insignificant and bereft in Krasnaya Presen . This was my preparatory school for the labor camps , my last polishing off . Is had gone steadily down from the thick piled carpets of Lubyanka to the very bottom of prison categories , and now my past , my name , even my social status as a political prisoner had no value . Now came the days when we were prepared for transport . They began , for no reason at all , with moving us around from one cell to another . In the rush some cells were left half empty . In others people suffered from suffocation and stench , with 150 to 200 prisoners jammed into cells calculated to accommodate 50 . I was desperately miserable , mashed in with a crowd of sweating bodies , when on Dec. 12 , in the evening , some 60 of us , a jumble of thieves and article 58 men , were called out and led into the . courtyard . The head of the convoy took over . He addressed us in the traditional fashion : " Attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your convoy . One step to the right or to the left will be construed as attempted escape . If there is any infringement of orders while you are on the march , I shall give orders to open fire without notice . Is that clear ? Forward , march ! " Thieves Step Out From the very beginning , the thieves took not one , but three or four steps to the right or left . But the convoy had a great flair for knowing the common criminals from the kontriki . Let a thief step out of line , who cares ? But let a kontrik so much as stagger from weakness or stumble , and the fiercest and most horrible volley of obscenities came down on him , as well as a shower of blows . It is true that the guards did not shoot , for we were still in Moscow , albeit on the outer edge . We were led to a freight station specially fitted up for the transport of prisoners . The transport train , consisting of 40 cars , was waiting . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with barbed wire . As each car was loaded , the doors were bolted , locked , and wires snapped around the lock . Sleep on Boards There were hooks under the cars so that if any prisoners broke thru the floor and jumped down between the rails , it would be horrible to think what their fate would be . Everything had been thought of to provide confirmation for the saying current in the Soviet Union : " We are having brighter lives , we are having better lives ! " Our contingent of 60 was loaded into a car which was supposed to hold 40 , but all of us were jammed in and they promised to add more along the way . Along either side of the car there were three tiers of wooden boards to lie on . In the center was a stove and four logs . The walls were sheathed with ice . Opposite the doors , near the other wall , a small hole had been made in the floor , from which protruded a small pipe not more than 31/2 inches- in diameter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this car . The weaker and sickly ones die and their corpses lie untended until their turn to be unloaded comes . I wondered at the time and I wonder even now whether the outer world knows about all this ? Do the people who willingly visit the Soviet Union on tourist visas know that these things go on ? Unfed for 48 Hours For 48 long and excruciating hours we remained on a siding in that freight station in Moscow . For all those 48 hours we received no food , yet our guards reeked of vodka , and we heard their drunken singing . Later I learned that the guards use this time between loading a n d departure to swap the prisoners ' food for vodka . We were no longer , so to say , in Moscow , nor were we under way , either . We had merely ceased to exist and there . was no need to feed us. ? During the third night we were awakened by a great lurch of the train . With deafening thumps the buffers struck each other , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unknown . We were on our way to Siberia .
