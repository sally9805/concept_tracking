As James J. Saxon , until recently Comptroller of the Currency , saw it , " Enclaves of monopoly and stagnant , unprogressive banks should not be safeguarded . " Implementing that peppery philosophy during his five controversial years in office , Saxon approved 3,806 new national-bank branches , many of which were in direct competition with state-chartered banks . Fighting back , state banks in nine states so far have sued to close some of Saxon 's federal branches . Last week the Supreme Court decided that Saxon had stretched his powers too far . <P> Ruling unanimously on two cases involving Utah banks , the court held that national banks are wholly bound by state laws restricting branches for state-chartered banks . In adopting the 1927 and 1933 banking laws , said Justice Tom C. Clark , Congress clearly intended to provide " competitive equality " in branching between the two kinds of banks . Utah law forbids banks to set up branches outside Salt Lake City , except by acquiring an existing bank that has been operating at least five years . Even so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First National Bank of Logan and in 1963 one in Ogden for First Security Bank of Utah , partly on the ground that Utah 's restriction on branching " method " did not apply to national banks . That approval , ruled Justice Clark , amounted to " a strange argument that permits one to pick and choose what portion of the law binds him . " <P> <P> The decision , upholding what most bankers have long considered to be the status quo , will re-stabilize bank competition in the 22 states ( including Utah ) that limit bank branching in various ways . Sixteen other states prohibit all branch banks . Only twelve states allow unlimited branches . <P> <P> At the minimum , the decision will have a significant effect on a dozen pending lawsuits over branching , notably in Michigan ; yet the comptroller 's office professed at week 's end to have no notion how many more of Saxon 's controversial branch approvals might now be subject to attack . Many bankers seemed to agree with President Jack T. Conn of the American Bankers Association , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saxon , who became co-chairman of the American Fletcher Na tional Bank &; Trust Co. of Indianapolis after his term as comptroller expired last month . Saxon scoffed at Clark 's opinion as " superficial , " forecast a new wave of litigation over branching laws , criticized the way the Government had defended his position . " The original brief prepared in our office was masterly , " he said , " but it was emasculated by the Solicitor General 's office . This case went down by default . " <P> Jn Logan , First National Bank promised to keep battling too . For a start , the bank said that it will sue to test the constitutionality of Utah 's restrictive branching law .
