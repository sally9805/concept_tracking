What is truth ? said jesting Pilate ; and would not stay for an answer . <P> - Bacon <P> All Freedom is academic . <P> - Pogo <P> The faith of the U.S. university is that free trade in ideas leads to knowledge and wisdom . That this concept is flourishing was clear at the recent 49th annual meeting of the American Association of University Professors in San Francisco . Yet academic freedom remains a vexed issue because the ideals work out in practice as a tough position on the part of the professors : that colleges shall not fire professors who profess to be seeking truth , even when the professor 's " truth " diametrically opposes everyone else 's . <P> This sort of freedom goes well beyond every man 's constitutional right of free speech , and is too lofty to be confused , as it commonly is by whiny teachers or muddled newspapers , with lesser liberties of the profession . Academic freedom can not properly be employed to license oddball behavior , or give special sanction to a teacher 's statements when made off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incompetence , or exempt professors from criticism . <P> Yet these distinctions make the central concept all the stronger . Columbia 's Physicist Isidor I. Rabi defines academic freedom as " the right to knowledge and the free use thereof . " It is every professor 's responsibility " to discover , speak and teach the truth , however difficult and unpopular this may be to others , " says the board of trustees of the University of North Carolina . " One can not search for the truth with a closed mind or without the right to question and doubt at every step , " says University of Chicago President George Beadle , who in his time has found a lot of truth . <P> Pressure &; Conformity . Academic freedom has two historic liens on it in the U.S. Most U.S. colleges were founded by churches , and dogma long kept a restraining hand on evidential inquiry . Then came state universities , dominated by legislatures and Governors , who control the purse strings . Vulnerable to doctrinal or political pressures , professors have been fired for views on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sex and Cuba . <P> This outside pressure creates an inside pressure : academic conformity among thousands of bystanding professors . Historian Russell Kirk has denounced the academic community 's " voluntary conformity to pragmatic smugness and the popular shibboleths of the day . " In the words of a Stanford professor , " No one wants the boat rocked , and freedom with responsibility usually means keeping your mouth shut . " <P> The average U.S. professor is no Socrates . In the face of possible wrath or ridicule , he tends to retreat to " safe " positions . By such faculty flinching , everyone is cheated . Who knows what the world loses , wrote John Stuart Mill , in " the multitude of promising intellects combined with timid characters , who dare not follow out any bold , vigorous , independent train of thought lest it should land them in something which would admit of being considered irreligious or immoral " - or subversive or even Philistine ?                    @
