THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment F only it worked , the anti-ballistic-/ missile system , or ABM , would he the most triumphant development in military technology since the atomic bomb . It would make Americ.a a bombproof fortress , insuring that future world wars , like the past two , would he fought on someone else 's territory . Unfortunately , however , almost no experts believe that it will work . And last week the Administration halted the Pentagon 's enthusiastic rush to construct ABM sites , giving President Nixon time to decide whether he wants the ABM at all . When Secretary of Defense McNamara announced the decision to go ahead with the Sentinel ABM system , he said that the ABM could not possibly defend us against the large Soviet striking force but would he useful against a far smaller Chinese attack . We can assume that the narration by the war-game computers goes something like this : The Chinese , maddened by hatred or frustration , launch a few dozen missiles against a United States whose certain retaliation will destroy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Perimeter Acquisition Radar ( PAR ) when they are still more than a thousand miles away . A Spartan missile with a nuclear warhead is then launched . It is guided by the shorter-range Missile Site Radars ( MSR ) toward the hostile missile . When the interception is made , the Spartan explodes , destroying both itself and the attacker , If a Chinese missile slips past the Spartan , a shorter-range Sprint missile , situated near the PAR , will intercept it before it destroys the radar . The surest way to nullify such a defense is simply to overwhelm it . If more missiles are shot at , let us say , New York than there are Spartans or Sprints to defend the city , an H-bomb or two is certain to get through . And that is enough . Since the Russians already have a large and growing missile fleet , and can build more missiles cheap er and faster than we can defend ourselves against them , McNamara and President Johnson decided not to go ahead with an anti-Soviet system . Instead , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Chinese in the years between the present , when they have no missiles , and that unpredictable but rapidly approaching time when they , like the Russians , will have enough to drown a defense . To defend ourselves against an irrational suicide attack by the Chinese might possibly he worth five or ten billion dollars if the Sentinel system did not have so many other defects and uncertainties . The physicist Hans Bethe , among others , has pointed out that it is relatively simple to devise decoys and " penetration aids " to foul the radar and divert the intercepting missiles . Such devices are fairly cheap , are easy to design , and are well within the present reach of Chinese technology . Moreover , the recent Deputy Director of Defense Research and Engineering for Strategic and Space Systems , Dan Fink , has said , without being refuted , that the defensive radar itself could be partially blacked out by the radiation occurring when a Spartan or a Sprint explodes ; to deal with this potential defect , it may he necessary to redesign the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequency . Even new design may not give complete protection against radiation blackout . Also , since the Sentinel detects enemy ICBMs while they are high above the atmosphere , it may he possible for the enemy to circumvent the Sentinel by firing nuclear warheads on a lower trajectory from a submarine or a ship . All these deficiencies , as well known to the Chinese as to us , make it highly unlikely that the Sentinel can defend us against an enemy that is serious about getting through . Nor can we test this highly complex system under simulated combat conditions , since to do so would require exploding nuclear warheads in the atmosphere and that would violate the test-ban treaty . Objections to the Sentinel , however , go well beyond an attack on the system 's effectiveness . Despite our denials and our logic , Soviet military planners will undoubtedly assume that the Sentinel is designed for them and will press even harder to increase their stock of offensive weapons . We will then he under pressure to build more missiles of our own , Thus the nuclear-arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is all over we will still be able to blow each other up , just as we are now . Besides , the Sentinel system will require a loosening of a historic restraint  --  the principle that only the President can make the decision to fire a nuclear weapon . Between the moment the PAR sights a hostile missile and the moment a Spartan is fired to intercept it , only five or ten minutes can elapse . Since it is not realistic to require a Presidential or Cabinet-level decision in such a short period , the authority to fire will necessarily he delegated to a field commander , or to an automatic computer , which can digest and analyze data even faster than a general . Yet it was only five years ago that the country as a whole , and the Democratic Parry in particular , was horrified by Senator Goldwater 's suggestion that he might delegate nuclear authority to field commanders . Another objection has arisen nut of the Army 's strange decision to place several Sentinel sites near big cities . Since even the shorter-range radar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be intercepted just as easily from a potato field a hundred miles away as from the nearby suburbs of Reading and North Andover , where the missiles will in fact he placed . Such placement makes the chosen cities top-priority targets for attack . Furthermore , there is a remote but finite chance that a Spartan or Sprint warhead might explode by accident , destroying everything within a distance of five or ten miles and causfull review by Congress and the President . In response to these requests , to mounting public opinion , and to the inner doubts of the Executive branch , Secretary Laird last week announced that nothing more would he done until such a review had been completed . No one can predict the final decision . But one thing is dear . If the ABM goes Forward , the military-industrial complex is headed toward a serious confrontation , and , perhaps , its first major defeat at the hands of public opinion . Indeed , it may already have lost . ing heavy damage for a far greater distance . It has been argued that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protection of a possible last-minute interception . ( This contention does not apply to Spartans . ) The argument seems more like a rationalization than a reason , since the basic purpose of the Sprint is nut to defend cities but to protect the long-range PAR , and only the handful of cities that have PAR will also have Sprints . It is hard to believe that Boston , Seattle , and Detroit have been honored with a defense while almost every other American city  --  including Washington , D.C. ? has been deprived of whatever protection the Sprints will give . Also , it has long been known that anything like Sprint protection can be nullified by exploding a large thermonuclear bomb upwind and beyond the reach of short-range defensive missiles , thus sending a cloud of radiation over a city supposedly defended by the missiles . There is , however , one assumption that makes perfect sense of the choice of sites , : that this is not an anti-Chinese system at all but the first step toward the large , **30;3512;TOOLONG anti-Soviet system that was publicly rejected by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a system requires " point " defense around every major city ( along with a large fallout-shelter program ) to render it effective . Many of the most fer vent advocates of ABM in the . Senate have not concealed their conviction that the Sentinel makes sense only if the system is to be expanded , and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is known to share this belief . Secretary Laird hinted that this is the intention when he defended the Sentinel as a possible bargaining counter in talks with the Russians . Yet if , as our government has said , the Sentinel is worthless against the Soviet Union and has been designed only for China , it is hard to see why it would add to our strength in any United States-Soviet negotiations-Perhaps this is only an instance of last year 's non sequitur 's becoming this year 's The approval of ABM and the initial appropriations for its construction came in an election-year atmosphere , when many political figures were reluctant to challenge those who said the system was needed for the national security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been taken and cleared . The citizens of the chosen cities have been stirred to awareness that they may soon have nuclear missiles in the neighborhood . As is noted elsewhere in these pages , there have already been meetings of protest in the Chicago and Boston areas . In the last week or two , more than a dozen Senators , of both parties , spoke against the ABM and asked the Administration to stop the preparation of sites pending a Advanced WE were invited the other day by some friends of ours at the Museum of Contemporary Crafts to experience an environment they had just installed in their building , on West Fifty-third Street . The Museum of Contemporary Crafts ( a favorite of ours ) is an Advanced Museum , and we should explain straight off that Advanced Museums do not tolerate the sort of absentminded gazing and involved shuffling from glass case to glass case that one encounters elsewhere . Advanced Museums , these days , do not put on " shows , " to be " seen , " but , rather , install contrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be experienced , and we were told by our friends that this latest environment on West Fifty-third Street was an especially advanced one , having been designed to " awaken sensory perception " and to " encourage direct communication between the individual and the environment . " We were told , also , that the whole thing was called " Feel It . " The idea behind " Feel It " seemed to us to he wholly admirable ( we have no intention of letting our sensory perceptions atrophy ) , and so we set off for Fifty-third Street . Wthat we experienced first was a pleasant talk with Mrs. Susan de Heinrich , who works at the Museum , and who told us that the environment was " fantastic , " and that it brought to the surface all one 's neuroses , " especially claustrophobia . " We then went , with Mrs. de Heinrich , to the reception area ( through which one enters the environment ) , which proved to be a purple cavernlike place presided over by a middle-aged man with a good New York accent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Follow the arrows , one step through , one step down , " he said ) and , incidentally , to supervise the depositing of the fifty cents it costs nonmembers to experience " Feel lt . " We thought we would stay in the reception area for a minute and find out a bit about the environment we were to enter . We learned from Mrs. de Heinrich that the principal element of the environment is " plastic rain " ? two hundred and fifty miter of plastic rain , hung densely in strips from the ceiling . Contact with the plastic , she told us , is itself a sensory experience that tends to slightly disorient the people in the environment , who then experience more intensely the objects they encounter . To explain the broader purposes of the exercise , she gave LiS a document that said our way of life ( as it is lived outside Advanced Museums ) dulls our senses and inhibits our communication with each other . " ' Feel It , ' " the document said , " should be seen as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human being 's participation and movements as prerequisites , where experiences and knowledges directly and totally transfer to the participant . " We decided to enter the environment . We entered on the A7 B10 Pathway  --  an " artificial landscape " made of nylon fibres , glass , wood , and iron . The first thing we encountered on this pathway ( aside from a great many plastic strips suspended from the ceiling ) was a transparent-plastic fluor , beneath which we could see three synthetic fish , three small synthetic lobsters , and two ordinary hens ' eggs , presumably synthetic , too . Then there were some mirrors in the floor , and then we were completely in the maze , thrashing around in the two hundred and fifty miles of plastic strips . Mrs. de Heinrich was ahead of us , and managed to steer us toward some of the things we were meant to encounter . These included plexiglass tubes containing deformed crystal goblets , and then  --  more interesting  --  a divided sphere called " Il Maestro , " which produced electronic music as one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light rays passing between them . After walking through " II Maestro " several times , with pleas-tire , we found our way to more deformed crystal goblets , on a plastic platform . We were not alone in the plastic-rain environment , of course . Everyone sharing this contrived environment , we noticed , was terribly nice to everyone else , and a great many people seemed quite happy about the idea of the thing . One woman called to her companion that she had discovered a brick wall , which seemed to please her greatly , although , as she remarked , it was n't listed . After emerging from " Feel It , " we talked briefly with Gustaf Clason and Eric Sorting , two young Swedish architects , who had produced the exhibition . They were quiet and gentle men who said that they were gratified by the way people were reacting to what they had done . " They just have fun , and they do n't feel dangerous about it , " Mr. SOrling said , in a slight Swedish accent . Several times , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a time and come out in pairs , and that , he said , gave him particular pleasure . Laying Down Some Leather ANY unfortunate people whose lives are so barren culturally that they do n't know the Shim-Sham Shimmy from the Fishtail , the Shag from the Elephant Truck , the Machine Gun from the Boston Monkey , or even the Scarecrow Charleston from the Flying Charleston will have an opportunity to get straight on March 1st at Town Hall , when a pair of gifted and supple middle-aged dancers named Leon James and Al Minns will . present a history of jazz dance , from the early Cakewalk through the Twist . These two men devastated the ignorant last January with a triumphant concert on the same theme  --  Town Hall sold out on that occasion and they have now agreed to do it again . We watched them rehearse one evening a couple of weeks ago on the stage of Town Hall . The auditorium was dark ; they had not brought any records , and they accompanied themselves by snapping their fingers ; they laughed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they cut splendid and fantastic patterns across the stage , peppering the darkness with the astonishing percussion of their steps . " This is called Break a Leg , " said Leon James , leaping into the air in the middle of an old-time buck . " They did n't use taps on their shoes in the early days , " he continued , landing lightly . " They had an extra piece of leather  --  hinged  --  attached to the sole . " James , a Iean , mild , and amused man , was wearing black loafers , thick spectacles , a brown cap , and an orange turtleneck . He demonstrated most of the rubbery-legged dances , like the Camel Walk , and Minns  --  stocky , cheerful , and outgoing , wearing a blue turtleneck  --  performed the more strenuous and violent steps . ( James is fifty-five years old and Minns is forty-nine . ) They sailed through the Jig-Walk , the Blues ( or Shake Dance ) , the Black Bottom , and a variety of Charlestons . When James and Minns sat down for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found out that they had both sprung from the great Savoy Ballroom of the nineteen-thirties . In the nineteen-fifties , they had started doing concerts of jazz dance with Dr. Marshall Stearns , the late jazz historian . Stearns ' hook " Jazz Dance  --  The Story of American Vernacular Dance , " written with Jean Stearns , has just been published ; it 's a thorough and lively history , with a number of photographs ( " U.S. Thompson demonstrating the finish of the Georgia Hunch , 1923 " ) , recollections , and diagrams of steps , such as the Buzzard Glide , the Scronch , and Shoot the Pistols . With Stearns narrating , James and Minns appeared at jazz festivals and at colleges around the country . Minns , who now works in a factory-in Farmingdale , Long Island , was horn in Newport News , Virginia , and grew up in Harlem . " My father played the twelve-string guitar , and when I was six he 'd take me along to rent parties , and I 'd sing and dance , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a rent party . They 'd print up cards : ' Party at Susie 's Come On and Get Up Tight , ' which meant the opposite of what it means today . Like ' Get hoe  --  now they say ' cool . ' You paid twenty-five cents at the door , they 'd have a piano and guitar , and you just danced and had a good time . Whiskey was a quarter , and was probably made on the premises , and there was food . Later on , I went to the Savoy , because my . friends were going there . " James , who looks much younger than he is , has been a tutor at Columbia and currently works for the Neighborhood Youth Corps . He was horn in New York . " My parents thought that if you study too much , you crack up , so when I was a teen-ager they urged me to go dancing , " he said . " I went to the Alhambra Ballroom every weekend and stood in front of the bandstand . Since I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motions , all by myself . The girls said , ' He 's a snob , ' but I was just shy and lonely . I did all these odd steps ? sliding up and down , and spins , and knocking my knees together . They called me Rubber Legs and Knock-Knock , which later became Clock-Clock . Pretty soon , three or four girls came over and said , ' We like your style , ' and they asked me to dance with them , Then I started going to the Savoy , and I got pretty good . " The Savo ) Ballroom ( always pronounced Sa-toy ) , on Lenox Avenue at I40th Street , was torn down in 1958 , but for over thirty years it was a landmark of singular social and musical significance . It was the home , in the thirties , of the Lindy Hop . This was " a syncopated two-step or box step  --  accenting the offbeat , " according to Stearns ' hook , which continues " After these basic steps , however , there is a breakaway . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost any movement can he inserted , before the dancers return to each other . " What were known as " air steps " ? hurling one 's partner over one 's head , between one 's legs , etc. ? became as important as the " floor steps . " Both men remember the Ballroom with great fondness . " The Savoy was on three levels , " Minns said . " The cloakroom was in the basement . You went through glass doors on the street level , and inside there was pinkish light . Two marble staircases went up to a single entrance on the second floor . Above the door was a huge mural : a mulatto girl , a colored girl in a blue evening dress , and a colored fellow dressed something like a sheik  --  all in dancing positions . " " There were maybe ten or twelve bouncers , all very nice , gentle , and soft-spoken , " James said . " But they were usually ex-prizefighters . " " I once saw one of them take four big college boys  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and this one guy tossed all four of them down the marble stairs , " said Minns . " The Ballroom was a block long . One-third of the space was filled with tables and chairs , and then there were booths along the windows . The ceiling was low , and draped . " " It had moving stars and moons , " said James . " They served wine , beer , and soda , " said Minns . " There were two handstands , two hands , and never any pause in the music . As one band was leaving , the second band would pick up the heat . They had hostesses in long gowns . " " Utterly beautiful , " James put in . " CaK au lait , most of them , and they were from Sugar Hill , " Minns continued . " Very haughty . They would n't talk to the average person . You had to he introduced . They did n't like to do the Lindy , either  --  only the Peabody or the Westchester . The dance floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wood . It was bouncy . You 'd stand in front of the bandstand and not move , but your body would go up and down like this . " He demonstrated . James said , " The Savoy was the one spot in America that Europeans wanted to go to . " " No tour was complete without a visit , " Minns added . " And the bands ! I remember one night in summer when they had Count Basle , Chick Webb , and Benny Goodman . The windows were open , and so many people jammed the streets outside to listen that they blocked off Lenox Avenue from a Hundred and Thirty-ninth Street to a Hundred and Forty-first . " James nodded . " There was quite a caste system at the Savoy , " he said . " As rigid as any society . You had to work your way up . " " To the right of one handstand was a spot about ten feet square , called the Cats ' Corner , and it had an invisible rope around it , " Minns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I was n't even in the caste system ; I was a scrub . " " I was a king , " James admitted , grinning . " The king would dance in that spot , and then it would be left empty , " Minns said . " They 'd say , ' He left the floor too hot to follow on . ' " " Nobody came on that floor after a king had been carrying on , " said James . " This particular night , I went up to the Savoy around midnight ? " " I saw this man come in wearing a champagne silk shirt , a champagne silk necktie , jodhpurs , and boots , and he was slapping a whip against his boots . I thought he was ridiculous , " said Minns . " I thought I was magnificent , " James said , laughing . " ' Cool ' is the word . Well , I deigned to dance . " Minns said , " I did n't know that rule about nobody dancing after the king , so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " It was really foolhardy , " James said . " Nobody could believe it . The other dancers were about u , do him in , but I said , ' Hold hack . ' I felt my position was unassailable . I thought , He must be a nut ; obviously , he knows the rules , but he does n't care . " " When I finished , I went over and said , ' Gee , Mr. Leon , I hope someday I can he as good as you , ' " Minns said . James said , " It was a double put-on . I said , ' Keep practicing . ' " THE NEW YORKER 31 " Lord , I thought you 'd never get here ! They 've taken over your office ! " ? ? " And we did n't trust each other for years , " said Minns . James recalled how potential Lindy Hoppers were spotted and developed at the Savoy . " Herbert White , called Whitey , was a bouncer at the Ballroom , " James said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had an imaginative eye . He took charge of the best dancers and supervised them . " " If you were a good dancer , he 'd put you with a girl , and yoli could go in free and , at night , dance to the best bands in the country , " Minns said . " We 'd get to the Savoy at four , right after school , and Whitey would make us do one chorus for five hours , tearing it apart . Then we 'd rush home , have dinner , and rush back to the Savoy . The girls wore saddle shoes , wide skirts , and sweaters ; the boys wore sneakers . We 'd start out with a necktie , and bring a dry coat to go home in . We danced eight or nine hours a day . I loved it . You spent your time not just rehearsing but helping each other perfect a style . Whitey would watch and tell you what would enhance your dance . No two fellows kicked out alike ; no two girls twisted the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lindy Hoppers , and he 'd get us work , " said James . " When the Daily News held the first Harvest Moon Ball , we were told by Whitey we were n't going to win anything , because we were black , and also because they had a lot of rules , such as you could n't break away from your partner , but Whitey said , ' Maybe someone will see you and hire you , ' so we entered . We broke all the rules , and we kept telling the band ' Pick it up ! Pick it up ! ' and we did the Freeze for an encore  --  we 'd dance and then all of a sudden stop . " " This was all something the public had not seen , " Minns added . " Strictly ethnic . " ? " And my partner and I on first prize , " James said . " I got a big diamond ring , and a week 's work at Loew 's State . " James toured Europe , Minns toured South America , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Hot Mikado , " with Bill Robinson . In recent years , however , there has n't been much call for dancers with their special knowledge and ability . Jazz ballets , James and Minns feel , are usually more ballet than jazz . " You ca n't find any strong jazz-ballet dancers today , " Minns said . " Kids who are trained in ballet are too effete . They just do n't lay down any leather . " Although James and Minns have non-dancing jobs now , they maintain contact with old friends from the Savoy days . " There 's a place in the Bronx called the Savoy Manor Ballroom , and they hold the Harvest Moon Ball preliminaries up there each year , and they still do the Lindy , " Minns said . " We all get together at the Ball , and it 's Old Home Week , " James said . " A lot of them do n't look it day older than they did , and they still dance just as well . Some of them are still back in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trousers . They never changed , and now they 're back in style ! " The two men laughed , stood up , and climbed back onto the stage . The finger-snapping started again , and their feet began to tap , and they tore into the Lindy , and followed it with such steps as the Susie-Q , Pecking , Trucking , Hitch-Hiking , and then the Shorty George , and the Big Apple . " This is called Spank the Baby ! " Minns cried , and then James said " Here 's Shake Your Duster ! " and a moment later Minns said " This is Fall off the Log ! " as they danced across the empty stage .
