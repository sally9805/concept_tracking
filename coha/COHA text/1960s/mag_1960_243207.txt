" In some countries they are experiencing difficulties upon independence they are having troubles , " said the massive man in flowing blue robes as he read the news from the Congo . Laying a broad brown hand on his ample girth and stretching up to his full 6 ft. 3 in. , Alhaji Sir Ahmadu Bello , 51 , the Sardauna of Sokoto , proudly told a Manhattan audience in clipped Oxford English : " But we in Nigeria are trained administrators . We have an old tradition . We inherited leadership from our ancestors . The blood of generations of leadership is in us , running in our veins . " <P> Sir Ahmadu 's bloodline runs back to his great-grandfather , who in 1802 carved out a Moslem empire through the mostly arid northern half of Nigeria . But Sir Ahmadu has brought off the neat trick of turning feudal domain into political machine . When the British called elections last December , as a first step toward independence , the Sardauna stumped the walled cities of the north in a campaign that included such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ballot box . His party won 142 out of 312 seats in the federal Parliament . Already Premier of the Northern Region , he wants no national office , with feudal condescension describes the new federal Prime Minister , Alhaji Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa , as " my deputy . " But Sir Abubakar , who is British-educated and will govern through what looks like a workable coalition with the non-Moslem eastern region , has gained major stature of his own , has gradually established his leadership of the new territory in fact as well as name . <P> On Oct. 1 , Nigeria will become Africa 's most populous new nation ( 35 million ) . " We need assistance , " said the Sardauna , whose frank pitch for both public and private capital took him from Wall Street to the offices of Secretary of State Christian Herter . " We need expert advice , money and equipment . We have a shortage of trained workers . Our supplies of power and water are not at present adequate . Our transport system is far from perfect . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without riots , without hatred . " <P> He has no doubts about the direction Nigeria will face or his pride in its stature . Said the Sardauna : " We know our friends , and we should state quite firmly that we stand solidly with them in foreign affairs . We will join the Commonwealth . When independence comes , Nigeria will rise first among equals in Africa . "
