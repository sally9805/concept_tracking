txt Representative Emanuel Cel-li ler , the chairman of a House inquiry , denounced the Port of New York Authority 's executive I director yesterday for what he termed an " outrageous deliberate falsehood . " The director , Austin J. Tobin , had just asserted in effect that Mr. Celler had subjected the I authority to public hearings in 1952 after first offering to stave off that inquiry if the authority would be " reasonable . " The clash at the hearing erupted after a reference to earlier charges by the authority ' outside the subcommittee that it was being newly investigated because Mr. Celler was still bitter over its rejection of proposals by three of his law clients in 1948 and 1950 . Mr. Celler and other members have heatedly denied these charges . Other developments on the ! fifth and final day of a werles so-called " preliminary " hearings by a House Judiciary subcommittee at the United States !

John M. Kyle ; the authority 's chief engineer , then testified that he received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company " from three of the contractor 's own references . Representative Celler said the hearings would go on into the new year to demonstrate a need for more adequate control and supervision of the agency . Set up by a Congressionally approved compact between New York and New Jersey in 1921 , the agency now runs nearly $1,000,000,000 worth of bridges , tunnels , airports , piers and other facilities in the metropolitan area . Charge Reviewed The latest clash between Representative Celler and Mr. Tobin came after Representative Lester Holtzman , Democrat of Queens , brought up the authority 's charges against Mr. Celler 's motives in the inquiry . On Thursday night , Howard S. Cullman , the agency 's ' honorary chairman , made public a detailed statement alleging " pressures " by Mr. Celler on the agency in 1948 and 1950 . Representative Holtzman noted that Mr. Celler had voted against a bill to repeal the Port Authority compact after the 1952 hearings . Mr. Tobin  --  who is facing criminal-contempt prosecution for refusing to produce authority records for the inquiry in a state-Federal jurisdictional test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called up Mr. Cullman before the 1952 investigation " and : said that if we would be rQasonable , he thought it could be worked out . " " That 's ' an outrageous , deliberate falsehood to make a statement like that , " Mr. Celler , a Brooklyn Democrat , said . Celler Gives His Side He said he had conducted the 1952 inquiry because a New Jersey member had introduced the repeal bill . Not only did he then vote against the bill , Mr. Celler said , but " I even went so far as to offer ' praise to the Port Authority for some things . " He said he would n't have done so if he had " harbored pique . " " I say , " Mr. Tobin insisted , " that you called Mr. Cullman and told him you were sure that if you and he could get together , you could straighten things out , and then there would n't have to he hearings . " " There is no truth whatsoever to that , " Mr. Celler said . " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. Tobin said . " Mr. Cullman is not telling the truth if he said that , " Representative Celler declared . The subcommittee then went on to discuss Mr. Blitz 's contract turn-down , and the contractor asserted the authority had a " select list " of contractors when it invited to bid . Tobin Concedes List Mr. Tobin said such a list was used when a contract involved " special considerations of time and quality . " He cited as an example the electrical lighting contract for the second deck of the George Washington Bridge , now under construction . " Fischback &; Moore , of which you are a director , was awarded the contract , " Mr. Tobin told Representative Celler . " Did I have anything to do with that ? " Mr. Celler asked . " No , " Mr. Tobin replied . " I only became ' a director of that recently , " Mr. Celler coinmen ted . ' Fischback &; Moore of 545 TVIadison Avenue won the $3 , - 700,000 contract jointly with the Lighting Electric Service Cornany of Newark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vublic bidding . Mr. Celler has said that this was before he beaArrie a director last summer . Discussing the agency 's overall activities , Representative Celler contended it was bringing more and more cars into the city instead of solving commuter railroad problems , and asserted " New York could be destroyed " by such measures . Mr. Tobin replied that the authority had spent " millions of dollars studying the commuter problem , " and that " great strides " were now being made . He said the railroads had to be kept running , and " we are in a period where they are all becoming a public responsibility . " In the same way , he said , the city had gone to the point of taking over its subways , despite What he called a yearly deficit of $100,000,000 , if debt service were considered . While he conceded that no railroad cars had yet been purchased by the authority tinder a fifteen-month-old , $20,000,000 New York State appropriation , Mr. Tobin said " tremendous progress " had been made in " tortuous negotiations . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were a more " cooperative aproach by the Pennsylvania Railroad , which Owns the Long Island . " The subcommittee study of the authority 's financing , presented by Julian H. Singman , associate chief counsel , said the authority 's - ? assets ? investments in facilities plus funds  --  exceeded its funded debt by $499,200,000 as of the end of 1959 , Fund Mixing Assailed ? The study said the agency had " exercised uncontrolled discretion over tolls and toll policies , " and asserted that the b mixinr , of funds had " beclouded " the question whether any individual facility had been paid for . During the day , authority witnesses promised to supply Representative Holtzman ? as a citizen , not as a member of Congress  --  with a list of the original cost , gross revenue , operating cost and net revenue of each facility year by year . The tactic was designed to avoid any admission of the right of Congress to demand such data , an issue in the Tobin contempt case . Mrs. Lee K. Jaffe , the authority 's $35,000-a-year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1960 budget was $226,600 . Herbert N. Maletz , subcommittee counsel , reported that bills by Mrs. Jaffe and an assistant for meals for the press at the Golden Door Restaurant at New York International Airport , during 1958 , 1959 and seven months of 1960 , had totaled $2,609 . Mrs. Jaffe said it was " quite normal " to invite the press to lunch during inspection tours or ' other events sponsored by the Port Authority , and this was " incidental to our work . " Mr. Tobin testified that telegrams sent to each member of Congress this year by Governor Rockefeller and former Gov . Herbert Lehman , both of New York , and Gov . Robert B. Meyner of New Jersey had en sent at his request and charged to his office at a cost of $15,000 . The telegrams argued that authority operations were a state matter , not for Federal investigation . A letter from Joseph S. Frelinghuysen Jr. , president of the authority 's exclusive insurance brokerage concern , reported to the subcommittee that Knickerbocker Associates had received net commissions of $8,063.79 for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1949 , until terminated in October , 1953 . Former Assemblyman D. Mallory Stephens , Republican of Putnam , is affiliated with the Knickerbocker concern . Late editions of The New York Times yesterday incorrectly listed Joseph M. Byrne , a former Port Authority commissioner , as having been a director of the American Insurance Company of Newark , which had $63,570 in authority Insurance during ten years up to 1952 . The reference should have been to the then Commissioner Horace K. Corbin.
