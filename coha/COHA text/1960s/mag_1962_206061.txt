WE are sometimes asked why the articles in TIME are unsigned . Our usual reply is that each issue is the joint product of all the staff names listed in the adjoining column , and that we prefer the traditional anonymity followed by such English institutions as the Times of London and the Economist . But another reason is just as basic-the fact that individual TIME stories are generally the work of many hands . This week 's cover story is a good example of how we go about it . <P> Off to Yugoslavia went Bonn Correspondent Jim Bell to see Ambassador Kennan . Bell , through the years , has been a constant reader of Kennan 's output , visited with him in October to get his views on Moscow 's 22nd Party Congress . Bell went back to Belgrade for the cover story , had three separate interviews with Kennan totaling 4 hours . <P> Tokyo Correspondent Don Connery , interviewing Ambassador Reischauer , was renewing an old acquaintanceship that began when Connery , at Harvard , and his wife , at Radcliffe , studied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover , Connery talked to Reischauer at his office and residence for four hours , continued the conversations riding with the ambassador and his wife Haru in the embassy limousine , at the Christmas party for embassy children , and elsewhere . <P> New Delhi Correspondent Charles Mohr has followed Ambassador Galbraith around India by plane , car and elephant , finds him " the easiest man to interview " he 's ever worked with . Mohr describes Galbraith a onetime FORTUNE writer ) as amiable , instructive and vivid . Mohr interviewed him six hours for the cover , the last 2 hours of it on an airplane bound for Bombay . <P> Well before these interviews began , Associate Editor Michael Demarest , who was to write the story , and Researcher Harriet Heck had been wading through some of the 25 books these prolific diplomats have written , before sending off the initial queries to the correspondents . Foreign Editor Henry Grunwald worked with them , suggesting ideas to pursue , questions to ask . <P> In the end , each correspondent filed enough material for a cover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Correspondent James Greenfield reported current State Department readings on each man , as well as the nature and limitations of each ambassador 's assignments . <P> All this might have been reported , at interminable length , under separate bylines from different capitals . Instead , it became the late-night struggle of Writer Demarest to assemble , digest and organize all this material , to find a writer 's way to tell the story , cutting from one character to another , and in collaboration with Editor Grunwald to decide on the story 's pace , tone and attitude . This is by no means a full accounting of all who had a hand in this week 's cover , but may help explain why bylines rarely appear in TIME .
