Pleased to meet you . This here is a bundle of notes , a rough autobiography , poorly  --  4  --  typed , which Mr. Humbert Humbert wrote after his arrest , in prison , where he was held without bail on a charge of murder , and in the psychopathic ward where he was committed for observation . Without this document his crime would have remained unexplained . Naturally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtaining the information revealed here not from the typewriter but from the couch . The murder Humbert perpetrated is only a side product of his case . His memoir is mainly an account of his fatal infatuation with a certain type of very young girl and of the torments he underwent in his vortex of libido and guilt . I have no intention to glorify Humbert . He is horrible , he is abject . He is a shining example of moral leprosy . But there are in his story depths of passion and suffering , patterns of tenderness and distress , that can not be dismissed by his judges . As a case history , his autobiography will no doubt become a classic in psychiatric circles . But more important to us is the ethical impact it should have on a serious audience . For here lurks a general lesson : the wayward child , the egotistic mother , the panting maniac  --  these are not only vivid characters in a unique story . They warn us of dangerous trends .

My Aunt Sybil and Annabel 's parents apparently realized that if she and I filched somehow five mad minutes of privacy , God knows what would come of it . Therefore , they saw to our not obtaining that privacy . In fact , any meeting between us was allowed only on condition we kept in the public domain .

I understand that . ( Listens . ) Okay then . I 'll be expecting him around noon . ( Listens . ) Not at all , not at all ( melodious laugh ) . Everything in the world happens at short notice . ( Listens . ) Yes , do that . You know , I could not sleep all night thinking of that dreadful fire and your poor wife . You 're so right to have sent her and Ginny to Parkington . Well , please do tell your wife that if there 's anything I can do  --  ( Hangs up . ) &nbsp; LOLITAMother , is that man going to stay with us ? &nbsp; CHARLOTTEHe is .

CUT TO : Humbert 's Arrival FADE IN  --  31  --  Section Details RAMSDALE - A THRIVING RESORT - SOMEWHERE BETWEEN MINNESOTA AND MAINE Ramsdale ( a thriving resort , somewhere between Minnesota and Maine ) as seen by a traveler arriving by plane . We are served the dish of the large , pine-fringed , scintillating Ramsdale Lake , with , at one end , a recreation park and a stucco pleasure dome . A small cloud of dark smoke is hanging over part of the suburban development . Beyond this is the cheerful , neat-looking town in the sunshine of a serene May morning . The airport spreads out beneath us , flying its flags and gently gyrating as the plane 's shadow sweeps over it . CUT TO : Alfalfa Fields , Asphalted Spaces , Parked Cars : Ramsdale Airport Humbert carrying briefcase lands and enters the office . His bags follow . He looks around . &nbsp; HUMBERTSomebody was supposed to meet me .... He consults a little black diary . &nbsp; DESK CLERKCan I help you , sir ? &nbsp; HUMBERTMay I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number . Consults his diary again . Redials . There is no answer . &nbsp; HUMBERTFunny. ( to the clerk ) Where can I find a taxi ? &nbsp; CLERK ( pointing with pencil ) Down there . He 'll take your bags .  --  32  --  CUT TO : Humbert in Taxi They cross the town and turn in to Lake Avenue . Sounds of fire engines . Firefighters going back to their station . &nbsp; TAXI DRIVERWe sure had a big storm last night . Lightning struck a house in Lake Avenue , and oh boy , did it burn ! ( does a double take ) Say , mister , what number you said you were going ? &nbsp; HUMBERTNine hundred . Nine oh oh . &nbsp; TAXI DRIVER(chuckling) Well , " oh-oh " is about all that 's left of it . CUT TO : The Black , Hosewater-drenched , Still Smoking Remains of a Burned-Down House Policemen are still keeping away a thinning crowd of spectators , most of whom have come by car or bicycle . The charred ruins are those of the McCoo villa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Humbert 's taxi stops at a roped-off puddle . &nbsp; TAXI DRIVER ( continuously indulging in raw , ready humor ) Here you are , sir . &nbsp; HUMBERTMy goodness ! You mean this is the McCoo residence ? &nbsp; TAXI DRIVERResidence ? Oh , brother !  --  33  --  Humbert , automatically carrying raincoat and briefcase , climbs out of the car . Faint cheers from the crowd . &nbsp; PATROLMANYou ca n't come any closer . &nbsp; HUMBERTI 'm supposed to live here . &nbsp; PATROLMANWhy do n't you speak to the owner ? That 's Mr. McCoo down there . ( In the following scene the grotesque humor turns upon McCoo 's conducting a kind of guided tour through a non-existent house . He makes the belated honors of the home Humbert would have shared . ) McCoo , a small fat man , emerges from the ruins of the patio . He staggers along with a big barbecue roaster in his arms . He is dirty and wet , and utterly bewildered . He stops and stares at Humbert . &nbsp; HUMBERTHow do you do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be your lodger . &nbsp; MCCOO ( setting down his burden ) What do you know ! Mr. Humbert , I must apologize . I thought my wife would leave you a message at the airport . I know she found other lodgings for you . Look at this dreadful disaster . He gestures toward architectural ghosts in the aura of the vanished villa . &nbsp; MCCOOFollow me . Look , sir , look . Your room was right here . A beautiful , sunny , quiet studio . That was your bed  --  with a brand-new mattress . Here you had a writing desk  --  you see , that 's where the wall ran  --  where that hose lies now .  --  34  --  Humbert blankly considers a heap of water-soaked volumes . &nbsp; MCCOOGinny 's encyclopedia . ( Glances up at a non-existent upper story . ) Must have dropped through the floor of my daughter 's room . Good illustrations . Cathedrals . Cocoa Industry . It 's a wonder that bolt did not kill Mrs. McCoo and me in the master bedroom . Our little daughter was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . A regular showpiece . People came all the way from Parkington to see it . Humbert stumbles over a board . &nbsp; MCCOOCareful . I know there is not much left but I 'd like you to see the patio . Here was the barbecue table . Well , that 's all out now . I had planned to have you give lessons in French to my little Ginny , the poor pet . I 've bundled them off to Parkington . And of course I 'm fully insured . But still it 's a terrible shock . Now , about that other place for you  --  McCoo , wiping a dirty face with a dirty hand , walks back to the street with carefully high-stepping Humbert . The camera escorts them . &nbsp; MCCOOWe thought that other place would be the best arrangement , under these sad circumstances . We all have to rough it now . She 's a widow , a delightful personality with a lot of culture . But it 's not as grand as here , though much nearer to town . The address @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hullo , Joe . CUT TO : Hysterical Bark of a car-chasing Collie on Lawn Street , down which Humbert 's taxi arrives to stop at No. 342 , an unattractive  --  35  --  white clapboard suburban house , with a smooth philistine lawn where only one dandelion has survived the leveling power mower . Humbert emerges , watched by Charlotte from an upper window . The driver is about to help with the suitcases . &nbsp; HUMBERTNo , leave those bags . I want you to wait a few minutes . &nbsp; DRIVERSure . &nbsp; HUMBERTI doubt very much that I 'll stay here . ( in vocal brackets ) What a horrible house . The door is ajar . Humbert enters . The hallway is graced with Mexican knicknacks and the banal favorites of arty middle-class ( such as a Van Gogh reproduction ) . An old tennis racket with a broken string lies on an oak chest . There is a telephone on a small table near the living-room door , which is ajar . From the upper landing comes the voice of Mrs. Haze , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monsieur Humbert ? " A bit of cigarette ash drops from above as Humbert looks up . Presently the lady herself  --  sandals , slacks , silk blouse , Marlenesque face ( in that order )  --  comes down the steps , her index finger still tapping upon the cigarette . Shake hands . &nbsp; HUMBERTHow do you do . Allow me to explain the situation .  --  36  --  &nbsp; CHARLOTTEYes  --  I know everything . Come on in . CUT TO : Humbert and Charlotte enter the parlor She makes Javanese-like gestures : inviting him to choose a seat . ( N.B. : these gestures will be repeated by Dolly Schiller in last scene of play ) . They sit down . &nbsp; CHARLOTTELet 's get acquainted and then I 'll show you your room . I have only Dromes . &nbsp; HUMBERTThanks , I do n't smoke . &nbsp; CHARLOTTEOh well , one vice the less . I 'm a tissue of little vices . C'est la vie . ( Lights up . ) You 're sure you 're comfortable in that old chair ? He removes from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perfectly . &nbsp; CHARLOTTE ( relieving him of the ball ) I think , Mr. Humbert , I have exactly what you are looking for . I understand you wanted to stay at Ramsdale all summer ? &nbsp; HUMBERTI 'm not sure . No , I really could not say . The point is I have been very ill , and a friend suggested Ramsdale . I imagined a spacious house on the shore of a lake . The CAMERA meanwhile examines ironically various crannies of the room . &nbsp; CHARLOTTEWell , the lake is only two miles from my spacious house .  --  37  --  &nbsp; HUMBERTOh , I know . But I envisaged a villa , white dunes , the accessible ripples , a system of morning dips . &nbsp; CHARLOTTEFrankly , between you and I , the McCoo residence , though perhaps a bit more modern than mine , is not at all on the lake front , not at all . You have to walk two blocks to see it . &nbsp; HUMBERTOh , I 'm sure there would have been some flaw , some disappointment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular dream , not any house but that house . &nbsp; CHARLOTTEI 'm sorry for the McCoos  --  but they should not have promised too much . Well , I can offer you congenial surroundings in a very select neighborhood . If you like golf , as I am sure you do , we are practically at walking distance from the country club . And we are very intellectual , yes sir . You are a professor of poetry , are n't you ? &nbsp; HUMBERTAlas . I shall be teaching at Beardsley College next year . &nbsp; CHARLOTTEThen you will certainly want to address our club , of which I am a proud member . Last time we had Professor Amy King , a very stimulating teacher type , talk to us on Dr. Schweitzer and Dr. Zhivago . Now let us take a peek at that room . I 'm positive you 're going to love it . CUT TO : Charlotte and Humbert reach the upper landing  --  38  --  &nbsp; CHARLOTTEIt 's what you might call a semi-studio  --  or almost a semi-studio . She closes quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and opens a door opposite . &nbsp; CHARLOTTEWell here we are . Is n't that a cute book-shelf ? Look at those colonial book ends . Now , in that corner ( meditative pause , with elbow in palm ) I shall put our spare radio set . &nbsp; HUMBERTNo , no . Please , no radio . He winces as he glances at a picture : a reproduction of Ren Prinet 's " Kreutzer Sonata "  --  the unappetizing one in which a disheveled violinist passionately embraces his fair accompanist as she rises from her piano stool with clammy young hands still touching the keys . &nbsp; CHARLOTTENow , that 's a rug Mr. Haze and I bought in Mexico . We went there on our honeymoon , which was  --  let me see  --  thirteen years ago . &nbsp; HUMBERTWhich was about the time I got married . &nbsp; CHARLOTTEOh , you are married ? &nbsp; HUMBERTDivorced , madam , happily divorced . &nbsp; CHARLOTTEWhere was that ? In Europe ? &nbsp; HUMBERTIn Paris . &nbsp; CHARLOTTEParis must be wonderful at this time of the year . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to  --  39  --  Europe just before Mr. Haze died , after three years of great happiness . He was a lovely person , a man of complete integrity . I know you would have enjoyed talking to him and he to you . Now , here we have  --  Humbert opens a closet . A painted screen of the folding type topples into his arms . Pictured on it is a nymphet in three repeated designs : ( 1 ) gazing over a black gauze fan , ( 2 ) in a black half-mask , ( 3 ) in bikini and harlequin glasses . There is a rent in the fabric . &nbsp; CHARLOTTEOops ! I am sorry . We bought it at the store here to match our Mexican stuff but it did not wear well . I 'll have Lolita remove it to her room . She loves it . &nbsp; HUMBERTYou have a maid living in the house ? &nbsp; CHARLOTTEOh no , what do you think ? Ramsdale is not Paris . There 's a colored girl who comes three times a week and we think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed-lamp does not work . I 'll have it fixed . &nbsp; HUMBERTBut I thought you said  --  Carefully and rather wistfully , Charlotte closes the door of the unsuccessful room . She opens another door next to it . &nbsp; CHARLOTTEThis is the bathroom . I 'm sure that as a European intellectual you hate our luxurious modern monstrosities  --  tiled tubs and goldern faucets . This here is a good old-fashioned type with the kind of quaint plumbing that should appeal to an Englishman . I must apologize for this dirty sock . Now , if we walk down again I 'll show you the dining room  --  and , of course , my beautiful garden .  --  40  --  &nbsp; HUMBERTI understood there would be a private bath . &nbsp; CHARLOTTESorry . &nbsp; HUMBERTI do n't want to take so much of your time . It must be a frightful bother  --  &nbsp; CHARLOTTENo bother at all . Humbert and Charlotte walk via the parlor into the dining room , the camera trucking with them . &nbsp; CHARLOTTEHere we have our meals . Down there is the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monsieur . ( sigh ) I 'm afraid you are not too favorably impressed . &nbsp; HUMBERTI must think it over . I have a taxi waiting out there .

Did n't I have a raincoat ? &nbsp; CHARLOTTEI saw you leave it in the car . &nbsp; HUMBERTSo I did . Well  --  He bows . &nbsp; CHARLOTTEOh , but you must visit my garden ! Humbert follows her .  --  41  --  &nbsp; CHARLOTTEThat 's the kitchen there . You might like to know I 'm a very good cook . My pastries win prizes round here . Humbert follows Charlotte to the veranda . Now comes the shock of dazzling enchantment and recognition . " From a mat in a pool of sun , half-naked , kneeling turning about on her knees , my Riviera love was peering at me over dark glasses . " It might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metaphor of the next paragraph : " As if I were the fairy-tale nurse of some little princess  --  lost , kidnapped , discovered in Gypsy rags through which her nakedness smiled at the king and his hounds , I recognized the tiny dark-brown mole on her side . " Humbert , much disturbed , follows Charlotte down into the garden . &nbsp; CHARLOTTEThat was my daughter , and these are my lilies . &nbsp; HUMBERT(mumbling) Beautiful , beautiful .... &nbsp; CHARLOTTE ( with winsome abandon ) Well , this is all I can offer you  --  a comfortable home , a sunny garden , my lilies , my Lolita , my cherry pies . &nbsp; HUMBERTYes , yes . I 'm very grateful . You said fifty per week , including meals ? &nbsp; CHARLOTTESo you are going to stay with us ? &nbsp; HUMBERTWhy  --  yes .

I know from Mrs. McCoo that you are not supposed to carry things . &nbsp; HUMBERTOh yes , and there 's also a box of chocolates I intended to bring the McCoos . Charlotte smiles and exits . &nbsp; LOLITAYum-yum . &nbsp; HUMBERTSo you are Lolita . &nbsp; LOLITAYes , that 's me . Turns from sea-star supine to seal prone . There is a pause . &nbsp; HUMBERTIt 's a beautiful day . &nbsp; LOLITAVery . &nbsp; HUMBERT ( sitting down on the steps ) Nice here .

And lame . &nbsp; HUMBERTReally ? That 's curious . Lame ?  --  44  --  &nbsp; LOLITAYah . She had polio or something . Are you going to help me with my homework ? &nbsp; HUMBERTMais oui , Lolita .

Lolita turns over on her tummy . Humbert , awkwardly squatting , tense , twitching , mutely moaning , devours her with sad eyes ; Lolita , a restless sunbather , sits up again . &nbsp; HUMBERTIs there anything special you 'd like to be when you grow up ?  --  46  --  &nbsp; LOLITAWhat ? &nbsp; HUMBERTI said  --  Lolita , eyes shuttling , listens to the telephone ringing in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; LOLITA(yelling) Mother , is it for me ? &nbsp; HUMBERTI said what would you like to be ? Charlotte enters from dining room . Humbert , interrupted in his furtive lust , scrambles up guiltily . &nbsp; CHARLOTTEIt 's Kenny . I suspect he wants to escort you to the big dance next month . Lolita , groping , skipping on one foot , half-shod , shedding beach slipper , whirling , taking off , bumping into humid Humbert , laughing , exits barefoot . &nbsp; CHARLOTTEI 'll be driving downtown in a few minutes . Like me to take you somewhere ? Like to see Ramsdale ? &nbsp; HUMBERTFirst I 'd like to change . I never thought it would be so warm in Ramsdale .

At a walking pace they ride deeper into the Enchanted Forest . DISSOLVE TO NEXT ENTRY : We are on the piazza . Humbert takes up a strategic position in rocker , with voluminous Sunday paper , in the vicinity of two parallel mats . He rocks and feigns to read . Exaggerate the volume of the paper . Mother and daughter , both in two-piece bathing suits , come to sun themselves . CUT TO : Charlotte transposes jar of skin cream from farther mat ( mat 2 ) to nearer mat ( mat 1 ) and sits down on mat 1 . Lolita yanks the comics section , and the family section , and the magazine section out of Humbert 's paper and makes herself comfortable on mat 2 . There is an area of shade beyond her . Into this area Humbert , the furtive writer , gently rocking arrives in his ambling chair . He is now near Lolita . Mother , far , supine , on mat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself to the sun ; daughter , near , prone , on mat 2 , showing Humbert her narrow nates and the sea-side of her thighs , is immersed in the funnies . Tenderly , the rocker rocks . A mourning dove coos . Charlotte gropes for her cigarettes but they are on mat 2 , nearer to Humbert . She half rises and transfers herself to a new position , between him and her daughter , whom she shoves onto mat 1 .  --  48  --  Charlotte , now on mat 2 , near Humbert , fusses with lighter and casts a look at what he is grimly perusing : book review , a full-page ad : WHEN THE LILACS LAST most controversial novel of the year , 300,000 copies in print . &nbsp; CHARLOTTEHave you read that ? When the Lilacs Last . Humbert ( Clears his throat negatively . ) &nbsp; CHARLOTTEOh , you should . It was given a rave review by Adam Scott . It 's about a man from the North and a girl from the South who build up a beautiful relationship  --  he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but later she discovers that as a child she had rejected her father , and of course then he begins to identify her with his possessive mother .

CUT TO : The Garden Humbert in the leafy shade , writes in his little black book . Mourning doves moan , cicadas whirr , a jet beyond sight and sound leaves its twin wakelines of silvery chalk in the cloudless sky . A mother 's voice is heard calling somewhere up the street : " Rosy ! Ro-sy ! " It is a very pleasant afternoon . Humbert consults his watch and glances up at the house . He gets  --  52  --  up and strolls around , quietly trying to locate Lolita , whose voice is heard now in one room , now in another , while radio music comes from a third .

Please , Ken . And you come here . Pats the seat next to her for Hum . Humbert , not without hitting his head against the lintel , climbs in and arranges his long limbs beside Lolita 's bouffant skirt . The backrest of the passenger seat is pushed into place by Kenny who briskly seats himself next to Charlotte . She gives vent to her irritation by getting into reverse gear so abruptly that Lolita 's purse leaps off her lap . Lolita and Humbert fumble for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( controlling herself ) No backseat driving , children . And that is how Humbert obtains a few minutes of secret alliance with the nymphet .

It is assumed that Humbert and Lolita are traversing by car a distance of some three thousand miles , including side trips , from Lepingsville ( which is anywhere between Massachusetts and Minnesota ) westward through several mountain states to Beardsley , a college town in Idaho .

There is also a ( shorter ) series of eating places , from the breakfast counter of the Truckers Welcome , through the coffee-shop type , to the more or less smart restaurant . While the accommodations improve , and their pretentions climb , Lolita 's attitude takes an opposite , downward , course , starting with a forlorn semblance of affection and passing through a gamut of deterioration , to end in the wretchedness of their last night before reaching Beardsley .  --  119  --  We have now put up at The Humble Log Cabin , where Humbert and Lolita will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CUT TO : Acme Cabins  --  a Modest Cabin , One of Five , Higgledypiggledy in a Pine Forest None has a bath .

There is a Bible on the chest of drawers . A fly buzzes drowsily . Above Humbert 's bed there is the picture of a girl garlanded with wild roses . Humbert , in his curtained-off section , sits on the bed with his face between his fists in mournful meditation . Presently , he puts out the light and lies down ; silence .

In the living room , a stool is askew , pushed away from the easy chair with a medley of magazines spilled on the floor ; a plate with crumbs stands on the TV ; a heap of bluebooks ( ruins of a college examination ) have been left by Humbert on and around the divan . On a small table there are the implements from Lolita 's manicure  --  151  --  set : a bottle of nail polish has stuck to the varnished top of the table where it leaves a bald spot when removed ; one ballet shoe sits on the piano , its mate lies sole up on the threshold to the next room .

Are you disguising your voice , Roy Walker ? &nbsp; QUILTYNo , no . You are mistaken . &nbsp; HUMBERTWell , all I can tell you is that neither she nor I welcomes calls from strangers . &nbsp; QUILTY ( very suavely ) This is a complete misunderstanding . The group I represent is merely anxious that children should not keep late hours . You see , Mr. Humbert , I am a private member of the Public Welfare Board . &nbsp; HUMBERTWhat 's your name ? &nbsp; QUILTYOh , it 's an obscure unremarkable name . My department , sir , wants to check some bizarre rumors concerning the relationship between you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain plans for her . We know an elderly gentleman , a bachelor of independent means , who would be eager to adopt her . In the course of this speech Humbert takes a pillbox out of his waistcoat and swallows a tablet . &nbsp; HUMBERTThis is ridiculous . &nbsp; QUILTYHave you adopted her ? Legally , I mean ? &nbsp; HUMBERTWell , I  --  &nbsp; QUILTYHave you filed a petition ? Your stutter proclaims you have not . &nbsp; HUMBERTI assume that a stepfather is a relative and that a relative is a natural guardian . &nbsp; QUILTYAre you aware that the word " natural " has rather sinister connotations ? &nbsp; HUMBERTNot in my case , no . &nbsp; QUILTYBut you agree that a minor female must have a guardian ? &nbsp; HUMBERTI suppose so . &nbsp; QUILTYAnd that she is not merely a pet ? &nbsp; HUMBERTI really  --  &nbsp; QUILTYYou moved here from Ramsdale , Professor ? &nbsp; HUMBERTThat 's right .

In a naive effort to be  --  170  --  inconspicuous he plans to sleep two nights in the car ( the first , within the parking area of a trailer court and the second , somewhere in the Arizona desert ) . It is further assumed that Quilty , using three or four different rented cars , so as to avoid identification and confuse his victim , pursues Humbert from Idaho , through Nevada ( or Utah ) , to Arizona . Quilty 's plan is to have Humbert transport the minor female across two state lines down to Elphinestone , Arizona , where he will kidnap her and take her to his ranch in that vicinity . During the journey , there arises the problem how to get Lolita 's luggage out of the car . This is attempted at the stop in Waco , Thursday morning ( and successfully brought off on the following Monday , with the unplanned help of Lolita 's hospitalization ) . The glimpses Humbert has had of Quilty before ( e.g. , in Briceland and Beardsley ) had been too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remain a fleet shadow , a ghostly predator , as he keeps up with Humbert on the road , now overtaking him , now awaiting his passage .

FOWLEROh , were you ? &nbsp; HUMBERTMy second wife died four years ago . I inherited a stepdaughter . &nbsp; MRS . FOWLERBut that 's fascinating , Humbert . How old is she ? &nbsp; HUMBERTOh , she must be quite old by now . More than seventeen . She 's living her own life somewhere . I 've lost track of her . A nymphet comes in . &nbsp; MRS . FOWLERThis is Nina , my niece . In the course of the following dialogue Humbert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last moment , as she turns away , and he sinks back into his chair with a tidbit picked from a remote plate , does he permit himself one brief , sad , ember-hot , tiger-quick glance . &nbsp; MRS . FOWLERWhen is Rosemary coming to fetch you ? &nbsp; NINAI du n no . Soon , I guess . &nbsp; MRS . FOWLERWhat picture are you going to see ?  --  193  --  &nbsp; NINAOh , some western . I do n't care . &nbsp; MRS . FOWLER ( smiling ) Okay . Run along . Nina indolently leaves . &nbsp; MRS . FOWLERShe is twelve and in her blas period , if you please . &nbsp; FOWLERI think I 'll spank her if she perseveres in that droopy style . &nbsp; MRS . FOWLEROh , she 'll be all right after we take her to Europe . &nbsp; FOWLERWhat 's your vacation going to be , Humbert , m'boy ? &nbsp; HUMBERTI have no definite plans . &nbsp; FOWLERCome with us to Cap Topaz . It 's the best spot on the Riviera . &nbsp; HUMBERTI know it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from there . The Mirana . It has degenerated now into an apartment house . &nbsp; MRS . FOWLERWill you come , Humbert ? We 'll gamble at the casino . &nbsp; HUMBERTI dare not gamble any more . &nbsp; MRS . FOWLERWell , Frank and I will , and you can sprawl on the plage , and build sand castles with Nina . Is that a deal ? Will you come ?  --  194  --  &nbsp; HUMBERTWhat again ? The old pang ? The perilous magic ? No . I 'm not coming with you . The excitement would be too much . I have a weak heart , you know . &nbsp; MAIDDinner is served . CUT TO : An Exchange of Good Nights on the lighted steps of the Fowler home . Humbert walks off . His steps resound on the deserted sidewalk . &nbsp; HUMBERTI 'm very lonely and I 'm very drunk . The old magic . Kill Frank Fowler , marry Diana , drown Diana , inherit Nina , kill self . Oh , my Lolita , Lolita , Lolita . . . . Next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished his routine lecture and is collecting his notes . A male student comes up to the lectern . &nbsp; STUDENTI 've been auditing your lectures , Professor . My name is Shatzki , Norbert Shatzki , you had my sister in your class three years ago , she sends you her kindest regards . &nbsp; HUMBERTOh yes . Yes . &nbsp; SHATZKIShe 's married now . I was wondering , sir , if you would also cover Edgar Poe 's other loves ?  --  195  --  In the meantime , another student , a girl , has entered the classroom . &nbsp; GIRLMay I audit your lectures , Professor Humbert ? &nbsp; HUMBERT ( absentmindedly , paying little attention to either of them , still collecting his notes ) If you like . No , I 'll ignore his other romances . &nbsp; GIRLI 'm taking philosophy , but I hope to enroll in your courses next year . &nbsp; HUMBERTYes . Yes . He is now ready to leave . &nbsp; GIRLI see you do n't recognize me at all , at all , monsieur . &nbsp; HUMBERTGood God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we met . Time certainly flies . &nbsp; HUMBERTLet 's walk across the campus and have some coffee at The Den . &nbsp; MONAI 'm afraid I have a class in ten minutes . &nbsp; HUMBERTWell , let 's go to my office . It 's right opposite . CUT TO : Humbert 's Office  --  196  --  &nbsp; HUMBERTThree long years . . . &nbsp; MONAYou do n't live on Thayer Street any more ? &nbsp; HUMBERTOh no . I 've a room in Clemm Hall . And you  --  how have you been ? &nbsp; MONAOh , fine . I left Beardsley School at the same time as  --  as  --  anyway , I mean , I never finished Beardsley School . &nbsp; HUMBERTI see . &nbsp; MONAYour temples are a little gray , which is most becoming . &nbsp; HUMBERTYou do n't ask me an obvious question , Mona . &nbsp; MONASorry . Have you remarried , sir ? &nbsp; HUMBERTYou have n't changed . Evasive Mona , strange girl . &nbsp; MONAI 'm not strange . I merely know life rather well . Okay : how 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of junior college in Europe . &nbsp; MONAOh , so it 's true . That 's what one of your colleagues told me . What college exactly ? &nbsp; HUMBERTYou would not know it . A small college in Paris .  --  197  --  &nbsp; MONAOh . A pause . &nbsp; HUMBERTOld schoolmates seldom write to each other  --  is n't that so ? &nbsp; MONAIt depends . &nbsp; HUMBERTNaturally . Well , let 's chat  --  let 's reminisce , as Americans say . Why do you look at me like that ? &nbsp; MONAMr . Humbert . . . My parents sent me to Europe , too ; I , too , went to school in Paris . It 's odd that I never ran into Dolly . &nbsp; HUMBERTShe never gave you her address , did she ? &nbsp; MONAOh , I knew you were still teaching in Beardsley . I could always reach her through you , could n't I ? &nbsp; HUMBERTBut you did n't . &nbsp; MONAWell , no . &nbsp; HUMBERTAnd you completely lost track of her ? &nbsp; MONAWhy do n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while : she 'll be leaving next week . As a matter of fact , she may be already in this country . &nbsp; MONAYou are still very fond of your stepdaughter , sir ?  --  198  --  &nbsp; HUMBERTStill ? What do you mean  --  " still " ? &nbsp; MONAEverybody loves a child , but the child grows up , and something fades , something diminishes . &nbsp; HUMBERTPhilosophy major . &nbsp; MONABut is n't it true ? Or would you say that nothing changes ? &nbsp; HUMBERTNothing . &nbsp; MONAAnd you 'd still be ready to forgive  --  ? &nbsp; HUMBERTForgive ? Forgive what ? &nbsp; MONAWe are taking a purely abstract case . Assuming she had done something wrong  --  &nbsp; HUMBERTMona , will you stop acting the impenetrable vamp ? &nbsp; MONAWhy , everything is crystal clear now . I 'm very fond of Dolly , and it 's such a comfort to know that you always intend to be kind to her . &nbsp; HUMBERTDid she write you ? Please , tell me . &nbsp; MONADoes n't she write to you ? &nbsp; HUMBERTShe 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . &nbsp; MONAOh , the point is clear , sir . I 'm afraid I must be going now .  --  199  --  &nbsp; HUMBERTShe did write you ? You do know where she is ? &nbsp; MONAIn those faraway schools we were talking about , in those schools one can be very unhappy , their lamps are dim , but one learns a good deal . I 'm sure you need n't worry about our Dolly . I 've got a class now . The bell violently rings announcing the beginning of the next class period . It should now have been established that Mona has had a letter from Lolita , apparently asking her to find out if it is safe for her , Lolita , to write to Humbert . CUT TO : University Post Office  --  The time is 8:55 A.M. Professor Fowler takes out his letters . Humbert comes up and tweaks open his pigeonhole . &nbsp; PROFESSOR FOWLERIf your mail is a dull as mine , I 'm sorry for you , Humbert . &nbsp; HUMBERTI never expect anything  --  that 's my advantage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Richard Schiller  --  some graduate student , I presume . This is a fenestrated bill . This is a publisher 's list . And this is not for me but for Professor Humphries . &nbsp; FOWLERNot gay , as the French say . &nbsp; HUMBERTWell , I must be rushing to my exam . Room 342 , ( repeats ) 342.  --  200  --  CUT TO : The Door with That Number He stares at it for a moment . &nbsp; HUMBERTHow strange . CUT TO : A Large Classroom The questions have been handed out by a monitor , and the examination is under way . Humbert from his lectern morosely observes the bent heads . A crew-cut footballer shoots up an arm , and then buoyantly walks up to the lectern . &nbsp; FOOTBALLERIt says here , " How did Poe define the Poetic Sentiment " ? Do you want us to give a general answer , or actually quote the poem ? &nbsp; HUMBERTI do n't think there is any specific poem implied . &nbsp; FOOTBALLER ( utterly at his wit 's end but with optimism unshattered ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walks back to his seat . Humbert , sitting at the lectern , takes his mail out of his pocket and scans it . The monitor turns to the blackboard to write on it " 9:10 . " The footballer , gratefully but mutely , receives from his neighbor a secret note which reads " Poetry is the sentiment of intellectual happiness . " The letter that Humbert has opened begins talking to him in a small , matter-of-fact , agonizingly familiar , voice :  --  201  --  &nbsp; LOLITA 'S VOICEDear Daddy , how 's everything ? I 'm married . I 'm Mrs. Richard Schiller . I 'm going to have a baby . I guess he 's going to be a big one . I guess this is a hard letter to write . I 'm going nuts because we do n't have enough to pay our debts and get out of here . Dick is promised a big job in Alaska , in his specialized corner of the mechanical field . That 's all I 'm told about it but it 's really grand . Please , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manage with three or four hundred , or even less . Anything is welcome . I have gone through much sadness and hardship . Your expecting Dolly ( Mrs. Richard F. Schiller ) . Most of the students having filled a bluebook page in the same number of minutes simultaneously turn it , which makes a brief whistling rustle . Humbert has risen from his chair , dazed and unstable . He leaves the room followed by all eyes . CUT TO : pp. 144-170 &nbsp; pp. 202-214 COALMONT - A BLEAK FOGGY TOWN Coalmont  --  a bleak foggy town CUT TO : Hunter Road  --  a dismal district all dump and ditch , and wormy vegetable garden . Clapboard shacks line the wasteland . An old man is shoveling mud by the roadside . Humbert speaks to him from his car . &nbsp; HUMBERTWould you know if the Schillers live around here ? &nbsp; OLD MAN ( pointing ) It 's the fourth house after the junkyard.  --  202  --  CUT TO : Humbert driving up to the fourth house . Sounds of hammering and of two male voices exchanging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shack . Humbert turns off the motor and for a few seconds sits motionless . A shaggy dog with a muddy belly comes out and woofs . Humbert fingers his pistol , transfers it to a handier pocket , gets out of the car , slamming the door . &nbsp; DOG ( perfunctorily ) Woof . Humbert presses the bell button , keeping one hand in his pocket . &nbsp; DOGWoof , woof . A rush and a shuffle  --  the door explodes  --  and Lolita stands on the threshold . She wears glasses . She has a new heaped-up hairdo , new bare ears . She is frankly pregnant . Her pale arms and neck are bare . But neither the maternity dress nor the sloppy felt slippers can disguise her Botticellian grace . &nbsp; LOLITA ( after a pause , exhaling with all the emphasis of wonder and welcome ) We-e-ll ! &nbsp; HUMBERT ( in a croaking voice ) Husband home ? &nbsp; LOLITACome on in . She lets him pass , crucifying herself against the open door . &nbsp; LOLITA ( to the dog ) No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A Small , Shabby , Meagerly Furnished Parlor with the connubial bed disguised as a couch Lolita , emitting interrogatory " hm 's , " makes familiar Javanese gestures with her wrists , offering her guest a choice between the couch and the rocker . He chooses the latter . &nbsp; LOLITADick 's mending the back porch with a pal . I 'll call him . She goes out . " Dick ! " Dick and a friend come lumbering in . Humbert 's hand comes empty out of his trouser pocket . How disappointing ! &nbsp; LOLITA ( in a resounding violent voice ) Dick , this is my stepfather , Professor Humbert . &nbsp; DICKHow do you do , Professor . &nbsp; LOLITA ( to Humbert ) Dick is very deaf . Speak loud , please . Oh , and this is our kind neighbor , Bill Crest . &nbsp; BILLGlad to meet you , Prof. &nbsp; LOLITAThis calls for a celebration . I 'll get some refreshments . &nbsp; BILLLet me help you , Dolly . They go out . Humbert sits in a rocker , Dick on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a shock of dark hair , a nice boyish face . He needs a shave and a hearing aid . &nbsp; DICKThis is a grand surprise , Professor . Hope you 're here to stay . You 'll have this couch .  --  204  --  Humbert shakes his head . &nbsp; DICKNo trouble . We can sleep on a spare mattress in the kitchen . &nbsp; HUMBERTI 'm on a lecturing tour ... Lolita and Bill have reentered . &nbsp; LOLITA ( very loud ) He 's on a lecturing tour . He chanced to visit this town . I wrote him to look us up . &nbsp; DICK ( nodding sagely ) I see , I see . There is a pause . Beer is quaffed . Nobody knows what to say . Lolita greedily crunches potato chips . Bill signals to Dick . &nbsp; DICKWell ( slapping his knees and rising ) I guess , you two have a lot to talk about . Come along , Bill . Back to work . ( to Lolita ) You just holler , sweetheart , when it 's time for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . &nbsp; LOLITANot who ? &nbsp; HUMBERTYou know very well . Where is the swine you eloped with ? &nbsp; LOLITA ( inclining her head to one side and shaking it in that position ) Look , you are not going to bring that up .  --  205  --  &nbsp; HUMBERTI certainly am . Three years  --  during three years I 've been trying to find him . Who is he ? Where is he ? &nbsp; LOLITAI should never have written you . Oh , it was a great mistake . Now you are going to spoil everything . &nbsp; HUMBERTCould your husband give me that information ? &nbsp; LOLITA ( blazing and bristling ) Leave out Dick ! See ? Leave out my poor Dick . He does not know a thing about the whole mess . He thinks I ran away from an upper-class home just to wash dishes in a diner . Why should you make things harder by raking up all that muck ? &nbsp; HUMBERTBe a sensible girl  --  if you expect help from me . Come , his name ! &nbsp; LOLITA ( Half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) I thought you had guessed long ago . ( with a mischievous and melancholy smile ) It 's such a sensational name . You would never believe . . . . I can hardly believe it myself  --  and there 's no one I can brag to about it . &nbsp; HUMBERTHis name , please . &nbsp; LOLITASkip it . It does not matter now . Want a cigarette ? &nbsp; HUMBERTNo . His name .  --  206  --  &nbsp; LOLITA ( Lights up , shakes her head firmly ) It 's too late now to raise hell . &nbsp; HUMBERTAll right . I 'm afraid I must be on my way . Regards to your husband . Nice to have seen you . &nbsp; LOLITAOh , you are so silly to insist . I really should not tell you . On the other hand  --  do you want to know it that badly ? Well , it was  --  Softly , confidentially , arching her thin eyebrows and puckering her parched lips , with a note of fastidious , not untender , mockery , she emits in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quilty . Humbert regards her with stupefaction . &nbsp; LOLITAYes , Clare Quilty , the playwright . Oh , you must have seen his face lots of times in those cigarette ads ! And he was staying at that cute hotel at Briceland  --  remember ? And he wrote that play we chose for the Beardsley School show . And he came to rehearsals . And he followed our car in that absurd fashion for miles and miles . Do you know the word " cynic " ? Well , that sums him up  --  a bold laughing cynic . Yes , that 's him all over . Clare Quilty . The only man I was ever crazy about . &nbsp; HUMBERTThere is also Dick . &nbsp; LOLITAOh , Dick is a lamb . We are very happy together . I meant something quite different . &nbsp; HUMBERTAnd I ? I have never counted , of course ?  --  207  --  Lolita considers him for a moment as if trying to grasp the tedious and confusing fact that Humbert had been her lover . That poor romance is dismissed by her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raindrop of boredom . He manages to jerk his knee out of the range of a sketchy tap  --  one of her acquired gestures . &nbsp; LOLITADo n't be dense . The past is the past . You 've been a good stepdaddy , I guess . Watch your step , Daddy  --  remember that joke ? &nbsp; HUMBERTNo , that must have been after my time . Where can I find him ? &nbsp; LOLITAClare Quilty ? Oh , what does it matter ? Up in Parkington , I guess . He 's got a house there , a regular old castle . ( Gropes and rummages in a pile of magazines on the lower shelf of a console . ) There was a picture of it somewhere . ( Pulls out a bedraggled issue of Glance . ) Yes , here it is . The magazine opens in her slender hands revealing a photograph of Pavor Manor as shown in the first shot of the Prologue . She says with a deep sigh : &nbsp; LOLITAThis world is just one wild gag after another . If somebody wrote up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dart of her cigarette toward the hearth , index rapidly tapping as her mother used to do . Lolita had never smoked under Humbert the Terrible .  --  208  --  &nbsp; HUMBERTNo . I suppose not . Well , let 's recapitulate . So it was in Beardsley that you betrayed me . &nbsp; LOLITABetrayed ? No . In fact , Cue  --  everybody called him Cue , you know  --  Cue was very understanding and sympathetic toward you . You must not tell anybody but many years ago he actually was questioned once by the police about some kid who had complained . So you see you were among friends . Oh , he knew everything about you and me , and it tickled him no end . She smiles , exhales smoke , shakes her head , darts her cigarette . &nbsp; LOLITAYou know  --  that guy saw through everything and everybody . He was not like you or me  --  he was a genius . He had an Oriental philosophy of life . He believed in Life . Oh , he was  --  wonderful . Funny  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all dead . &nbsp; HUMBERTWhere exactly did he take you when you gave me the slip ? &nbsp; LOLITAYes , that was awfully mean , I must admit that . He took me to a dude ranch near Elphinstone . Duk-Duk Ranch . Silly name . &nbsp; HUMBERTWhere exactly ? What highway ? &nbsp; LOLITANo highway  --  a dirt road up a small mountain . Anyway  --  that ranch does not exist any more . Pity , because it was really something . I mean you ca n't imagine how utterly lush it was , that ranch , I mean it had everything , but everything , even an indoor waterfall . You know when Cue and I first came the others had us actually go through a coronation ceremony .  --  209  --  &nbsp; HUMBERTThe others ? Who were they ? &nbsp; LOLITAOh , just a bunch of wild kids , and a couple of fat old nudists . And at first everything was just perfect . I was there like a princess , and Cue was to take me to Hollywood , and make a big star of me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . And , instead , I was supposed to cooperate with the others in making filthy movies while Cue was gadding about the Lord knows where . Well , when he came back I told him I wanted him and not that crowd of perverts , and we had a fight , and he kicked me out , and that 's all . &nbsp; HUMBERTYou could have come back to me . &nbsp; LOLITA ( smile , shrug ) Oh , well . ... I suppose I was afraid you 'd kill me . And anyway I was a big girl now , on my own . So  --  I worked in motels , cleaning up and that sort of job , and in roadside cafs . And then after a year I could not stand it any longer , and thumbed my way back to the place where the ranch should have been . But it just was not there any more , it had burned down completely . So strange . ( Smokes meditatively . ) Well , I drifted back to cheap diners , and one day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both were lonesome , and so it began . She closes her eyes leaning back on the cushions of the couch , her belly up , one felted foot on the floor . " I knew all I wanted to know . I had no intention of torturing my darling . Somewhere , beyond the shack , an afterwork radio had begun singing of folly and fate , and there she was with her ruined looks , and her adult rope-veined  --  210  --  hands , there she was , my Lolita , hopelessly worn at seventeen  --  and I looked and looked , and knew that I loved her more than anything I had ever seen , or imagined , or hoped for . ... She was only the dead-leaf echo of my nymphet  --  but thank God it was not that echo alone that I worshipped . I loved my Lolita , this Lolita , pale and polluted , and big with another 's child , but still gray-eyed , still sooty-lashed , still auburn and almond , still Carmencita , still mine . Changeons de vie ma Carmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spars this is a quotation from Mrime 's novel , no matter , even if those eyes of hers would fade to myopic fish , and her nipples swell and crack  --  even then I would go mad with tenderness at the mere sight of your dear worn face , at the mere sound of your raucous young voice , my Lolita . " &nbsp; HUMBERTLolita , this may be neither here nor there , but I have to say it . Life is very short . From here to that old car there are twenty-five paces . Make them . Now . Right now . Come just as you are . Take that plate of peanuts with you . And we shall live happily ever after . &nbsp; LOLITAYou mean you 'll give us some money only if ? Only if I go to a motel with you ? Is that what you mean ? &nbsp; HUMBERTNo , you got it all wrong . I want you to leave your incidental Dick , and this awful hole , and come to live with me , and die with me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( her features working ) You 're crazy . &nbsp; HUMBERTThink it over , Lolita . I 'll wait for any length of time if you want to think . There are no  --  211  --  strings attached  --  except that  --  well , that a life would be spared . But even if you refuse to come you shall still get your dowry . &nbsp; LOLITANo kidding ? &nbsp; HUMBERTHere . Here 's three , four hundred in cash  --  and here 's a check for nine thousand six hundred . Gingerly , uncertainly , Lolita takes the money , and speaks with agonized emphasis . &nbsp; LOLITAYou mean you are giving us ten thousand bucks ? He covers his face and breaks into tears . They trickle through his fingers down his chin , his nose is clogged , he ca n't stop . He gropes for a handkerchief . She touches his wrist . He draws back abruptly . &nbsp; HUMBERTI 'll die if you touch me . You are sure that you are not coming with me ? Is there no hope of your ever coming ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She provides him with a paper napkin . &nbsp; LOLITANo , it 's quite out of the question . I 'd sooner go back to Quilty . I mean  --  &nbsp; HUMBERTI know . He broke your heart . I merely broke your life . &nbsp; LOLITAOh , but everything is so wonderful now . I think it 's so utterly grand of you to give us all that  --  212  --  dough . It settles everything . We can pay all our debts . We can fly to Alaska tomorrow . Stop crying , please . You should understand . Let me get you some more beer . Oh , do n't cry . I 'm so sorry I cheated so much  --  but that 's the way things are . He wipes his face . She smiles at the money . &nbsp; LOLITA ( exulting ) May I call Dick ? &nbsp; HUMBERTNo , no . Please do n't . I do n't want to see him at all . I must leave in a moment . &nbsp; LOLITAOh , do n't go yet . &nbsp; HUMBERTI love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  about these money matters . There 'll be more coming . I must go now . &nbsp; LOLITAIt has been nice  --  &nbsp; HUMBERTAll right , all right . ( evading her hand ) Yes , good-bye , I have a piece of very important business to take care of . A ragged , raw , horrible piece . CUT TO : The Front Porch A remote sound of voices and hammering comes from the back of the house . The song " Lolita , Lolita , Lolita " is repeated . Lolita and the shaggy dog see Humbert off . &nbsp; LOLITAWhat do you know  --  the same old car .  --  213  --  &nbsp; HUMBERTOne last word . Are you quite , quite sure that  --  well , not tomorrow of course , and not after-tomorrow , but some day , any day  --  you 'd not come to live with me ? I 'll create a brand-new God and thank him with piercing cries , if you give me that small hope . Lolita smiles , shakes her head in smiling negation . &nbsp; HUMBERTIt would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . &nbsp; LOLITAGood-bye . There 's a bad storm coming . &nbsp; HUMBERTWhat ? &nbsp; LOLITAA storm . Take care of yourself . Her cry and the sound of the motor attract Bill followed by Dick , as Humbert drives off , with the old shaggy dog loping heavily alongside the car , and soon giving up . We dissolve briefly to Lolita 's delirious cry of joy and to Dick 's incredulous stare at the gift she brandishes .
