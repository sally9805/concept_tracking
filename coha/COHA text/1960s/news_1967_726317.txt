txt The gentle land of Thailand is slipping into the front lines of the Vietnam war . At a Christmas show here , American comedian Bob Hope called Thailand the " parking lot " for the Vietnam campaign . But in the intervening months it has become much more than that . Right now 2,000 Thai infantrymen are polishing off their training before leaving for service as the first Thai combat unit in South Vietnam . More than 37,000 American servicemen now are stationed in Thailand . Most of them are airmen scattered at bases throughout the country from which United States jets screech off to batter North Vietnamese targets and the Ho Chi Minh Trail through Laos . In recent weeks big black B-52 's of the Strategic Air Command have started operating from U Taphao in southern Thailand against Viet Cong concentrations in South Vietnam . Aside from Vietnam , in its own.northeast provinces the Thai Government is facing Communist insurgency apparently masterminded from Peking . More Communist guerrillas are operating in the south on the border between Thailand and Malaysia . They may be responsible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long- time American resident in Thailand who vanished recently while vacationing in Malaysia 's Cameron Highlands . And if the Thai Government had its way , quivering surface-to-air missiles would point skyward alongside the golden spires of Bangkok 's peaceful Buddhist temples . A request for such missiles has been lodged by the Thais in Washington . All this tempts some observers to speculate that Thailand is destined to become another Vietnam  --  another country roiled and de- spoiled by war between Communists and anti-Communists . It is certainly true that Thailand in recent months has committed itself much more deeply and openly to the allied cause in Southeast Asia against communism . But as Thailand 's present rulers see it , this commitment is intended to help win the war in Vietnam itself and deter the Communists from spreading the conflict across Thailand . There are of course some obvious and ominous similarities for those who have watched the growth of the war in Vietnam . The American presence is beginning to strain Thailand 's social fabric .

The Munsters are at the movies , Bing Crosby 's son is singing at one of the local nightclubs , and trading stamps have come to town . Yet despite mutterings and sometimes more from the Thais about all this Americanization and the American build-up in Thailand , the situation is far from out of hand . Bangkok itself is a rambling and spread-out city . Even were the American inflow to be greatly accelerated , it is difficult to imagine the city being swamped by Americans as is small and clustered Saigon . United States Ambassador Graham A. Martin , who by all accounts runs a tight embassy here , keeps a stern eye on the American military and insists that their presence be as unostentatious as possible .

But in neon-bathed Bangkok the level of United States troops is watched . The num ber of soldiers on five-day rest-and-recreation leave from Vietnam is never allowed to top more than 750 in the city at any one time . What is clear is that none of this American presence is permitted by either top United States or Thai officials to infringe or even hint of infringement upon Thai independence and sovereignty . This Thai-United States alliance in Thailand is a hard-headed partnership of mutual benefit . Thailand gets more than $100 million in military and economic aid annually from the United States as a result of it , but there is no surrender of Thai independence . The Americans are guests in a proud and sensitive land . If there are similarities to Vietnam , there are also some notable differences . There is not , for instance , the same intense degree of Communist organization . There is no legendary nationalist leader like Ho Chi Minh .
