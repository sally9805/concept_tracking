The difference between the two occasions was simple but inescapable . The last time Lyndon Johnson stood before a joint session of Congress , the shock and mourning over John Kennedy 's assassination had not yet passed . Johnson 's State of the Union speech a year ago , for all its high promise , was still a message from an interim President in an uncertain hour . This week Johnson was ready to report on a Union that he himself had guided during 13 remarkable months . He was now President in his own right , with an overwhelming victory at the polls behind him and an overwhelmingly Democratic Congress - 68% in the Senate , 68% in the House . <P> Having accomplished a great deal in the last Congress , Johnson hoped to forge right ahead in the present one-and he was determined to aim straight for the Great Society . <P> Against Labels . In his State of the Union speech , as drafted during the last days of 1964 at the ranch , he was pushing hard for an increased anti-poverty program , large-scale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education , and the nurturing of what he likes to call " human resources . " <P> The President had begun preparing for his address as long ago as last July , when , with full confidence of victory over Barry Goldwater , he had instructed his advisers to provide him with ideas . They had come through with a vengeance . At the ranch last week Johnson showed reporters three thick , black looseleaf notebooks crammed , he said , with " thousands of pages from some 50 agencies . " But he was also drawing on a document of his own , an article he wrote in 1958 for the Texas Quarterly , which has become his and his advisers ' favorite statement of the Lyndon Johnson political philosophy . <P> In the article Johnson spelled out his brand of idealistic pragmatism and condemned the tendency to label and dogmatize , with too many politicians preferring to be expedient rather than patient : " To grant audiences to 170 million Americans would be exhausting . So we make our divisions , our classifications and our cross-classifications , which permit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do . " <P> Lost Billions . Nobody could accuse Lyndon Johnson of failing to listen or to search as he worked on his State of the Union message and the budget . All week long his Cabinet officers and budget advisers trooped in and out of the Texas spread with dollar signs dancing in their heads . For newsmen , Lyndon pointed out two brown picnic tables in the yard at which he and his advisers had worked on the budget . " That 's where you lost billions of dollars this week , " he chuckled . " That 's where I got the budget down , and a suntan-right there . " Whether , as Lyndon has been hoping , the final budget comes out under $100 billion remains to be seen . <P> Between other chores , Johnson drove to the Fredericksburg cemetery to visit the graves of his maternal grandparents ( " Joseph W. Baines . . . A True Man , A Loyal Citizen , A Dedicated Husband and Father , A Faithful Christian " ) and sent New Year 's greetings to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. in efforts " to make this a happier and safer world for all peoples .
