The Nabokovs have lived in Montreux for nine years . Recently , TIME Reporter Martha Duffy visited them there . Here are a few of her impressions : <P> " Choughs ! Choughs ! Alpine choughs ! <P> A little black bird with a yellow bill . A lacquered yellow bill . And red feet . " <P> " Oh , chuffs , " the heedless visitor says . <P> " Are n't they crows ? " <P> " A crow ? a CROW ? No , no , no , no , no , my goodness no , not a crow at all . They emit a beautiful sound , a sort of kissing sound-chwink , chwink-which a crow can not even approach . Pity is that they do it right on my window sill at dawn . " <P> So the day starts early for Vladimir Nabokov , when the nervy choughs commence kissing outside the sixth floor of the Montreux Palace Hotel . Not that there has been much night for him . " I am the insomniac of universal literature , " he cries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , smiling and looking around with my bright eyes . I am awakened by my own snore , which is a Nabokovian paradox . Helpful pills do exist , but I am afraid of them . My habitual hallucinations are quite monstrously sufficient , thank Hades . Looking at it objectively , I have never seen a more lucid , more lonely , better balanced mad mind than mine . " <P> Plumed Sunset . Sometimes his wife Vera awakes to furtive noises in the night . It is the mad mind at work shuffling the 3-by-5 cards on which Nabokov now does all his writing , and which he keeps under his pillow for nocturnal reference . <P> Staid during the season and stultifying offseason , Montreux is a natural haven for a genius with billowing dreams and a narrowing future . It is a two-street town , one low and one high , dumped at the foot of one Alp and facing another across Lake Geneva . Beyond the town is Byron 's Castle of Chillon , the big tourist attraction of the area . <P> The hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the staff tends to outnumber the 20-odd guests . Most of these regulars are women of 60 or more-a couple of Americans , a few English , a stray Parisian countess or two . Twice a day they gather in the Winter Dining Room , a smallish chamber in the hotel basement , which , despite lavish importation of daffodils and red tulips , is a frightful miniature of desolation . All guests have their own tables ; there is almost no talk . The Nabokovs have a cook and eat here only when they have visitors . <P> Upstairs , on the top floor , the Nabokovs ' apartment is a warren of small rooms . Directly below is a. room for their son Dmitri , who visits when he can take time from his operatic career in Milan . When he is in residence , the tone-deaf father sings gleefully in the bathroom until Dmitri makes him stop . <P> In the summer , the hotel and town are crammed with tourists . It is time for the Nabokovs to leave . They do - to a different place every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will be Lugano . Nabokov seemingly never tires of saying he may return to the U.S. " Especially in spring , " he says , " I dream of going to spend my purple-plumed sunset in California , among the larkspurs and oaks and in the serene silence of her university libraries .
