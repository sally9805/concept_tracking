Warren Investigation <P> Sir : By devoting your cover Feb. 14 to showing a picture of the wife of the man who assassinated our late President , you are glorifying the most despicable crime-assassination . <P> MRS . F. A. STRAUB Los Angeles <P> Sir : To encourage people to come to a conclusion before the commission has announced its findings is to undermine one of the basic principles of our legal system . <P> The more the evidence seems to point in one direction , the more important it is to remind ourselves that everyone must be assumed innocent until proved guilty . To do otherwise is to adopt the logic of a lynch mob . <P> JOHN T. ENNIS New York City <P> Sir : TIME has become so melodramatic ! Your story of Marina Oswald 's life made me feel like the " constant weader " who " fwowed up " in Dorothy Parker 's remark . The plastic roses on Oswald 's grave were just too much . <P> MRS . RICHARD H. DICKSON Indianapolis <P> Sir : For the first time since those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Lee Harvey Oswald . Imagine having something like that for a mother . <P> MRS . DON GARGARO Detroit <P> Sir : An excellent story . I wish it were possible for every mother-and father-to read your report on Marguerite Claverie Pic Oswald Ekdahl , mother of Lee Harvey Oswald . Through her seemingly warped personality , her failure to provide a modicum of healthy home environment , her unwillingness or inability to cooperate with professional people and public officials , Marguerite Claverie Pic Oswald Ekdahl plays an unenviable role in the circumstances leading to the assassination of John F. Kennedy . She wants to go down in history ? Well , history is replete with unsavory personalities . <P> ELIZABETH V. PARKER Randolph , Vt . <P> <P> Who Shall Not Be Moved ? <P> Sir : Transporting children across school-district lines Feb. 14 is unreasonable , unrealistic , chaotic , unwise , expensive , an unwarranted favor to any group , and a subversion of the primary purpose of the schools , which is to educate , not to integrate . Integration is a result of or at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MRS . ) JOAN Y. TUCKER Kenmore , N. Y. <P> Sir : As a native Atlantan , I found your article extremely shortsighted and biased . Tokenism does not exist in Atlanta , but racial exhibitionism does , thanks to your ready cameras and dripping pens Feb. 7 . Atlanta has gone much farther than was necessary in lowering all racial barriers . Atlantans have repressed their own feelings in a conscientious effort to give the Negro his equality , and now they face disgusting demonstrations in spite of this . The Negro deserved civil equality , and Atlanta gave it . The current demonstrations are unwarranted and indicative of the irresponsible , militant youths leading them . Their behavior is evidence of this . J. LARRY SANDERS University of Virginia Charlottesville , Va . <P> Sir : I read the article under " Civil Rights , " and I hung my head and cried from shame . I am a Negro . " Demonstrators rushed into his place , urinated on the floors when he locked his rest rooms " - no wonder they do n't want us in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filthy , dirty and immoral , but as long as any of our people act in this manner we will be considered so . <P> MRS . E. L. ESSOUND Pasadena , Texas
