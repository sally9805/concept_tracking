Some low chairs at the edges of the arena . These at first represent some bushes in the yard of the children 's home . At the back , the door to the house ; the aisle through the audience serves as a path to the street . Enter from the house Caroline , twelve ; Dodie , ten ; and , with a rush , Billee , eight . DODIE Shh ! Shh ! Do n't let Mama hear you ! Car'line , Car'line , play the game . Let 's play the game . CAROLINE There 's no time , silly . It takes time to play the game . BILLEE Play Goin ' to China . CAROLINE Do n't talk so loud ; we do n't want Mama to hear us . Papa 'll be here soon , and we ca n't play the game when Papa 's here . DODIE Well , let 's play a little . We can play Going to a Hotel . BILLEE ( Clamorously ) : I want to be Room Service . I want to be Room Service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's awful when you have to stop for something . DODIE ( Quickly ) : Car'line , listen , I heard Mama telephoning Papa and the car 's got to be fixed and Papa 's got to come home by a bus , and maybe he 'll never get here and we can play for a long time . p. 3 CAROLINE Did she say that ? Well , come behind the bushes and think . ( They squat on their haunches behind the bushes . ) BILLEE Let 's play Hospital and take everything out of Dodie . CAROLINE Let me think a minute . MOTHER ( At the door ) : Caroline ! Dodie ! ( Silence . ) Dodie , how often do I have to tell you to hang your coat up properly ? Do you know what happened ? It fell and got caught under the cupboard door and was dragged back and forth . I hope it 's warm Sunday , because you ca n't wear that coat . Billee , stand out for a moment where I can see you . Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come out of the bushes , Billee , come out . ( Billee , a stoic already , comes to the center of the stage and stands for inspection . Mother shakes her head in silence ; then ) : I simply despair . Look at you ! What are you children doing anyway ? Now , Caroline , you 're not playing one of those games of yours ? I absolutely forbid you to play that the house is on fire . You have nightmares all night long . Or those awful games about hospitals . Really , Caroline , why ca n't you play Shopping or Going to School ? ( Silence ) I declare . I give up . I really do . ( False exit ) Now remember , it 's Friday night , the end of the week , and you give your father a good big kiss when he comes home . ( She goes out ) ( Billee rejoins his sisters. ) p. 4 DODIE ( Dramatic whisper ) : Car'line , let 's play Funeral ! ( Climax ) Car'line , let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes all day . Besides , I have n't got the black gloves . ( Billee sees his father coming through the audience . Utter and final dismay . ) BILLEE Look't ! Look ! DODIE What ? ALL THREE It 's Papa ! It 's Papa ! ( They fly into the house like frightened pigeons . Father enters jauntily through the audience . It 's warm , and he carries his coat over his shoulder . Arriving at the center of the stage , he places his coat on the ground , whistles a signal call to his wife , and swinging an imaginary golf club , executes a mighty and very successful shot . ) FATHER Two hundred and fifty yards ! MOTHER ( Enters , kisses him and picks up the coat ) : Why , you 're early , after all . FATHER Jerry drove me to the corner . Picked up a little flask for the weekend . MOTHER Well , I wish you would n't open your little flask when the children are around . p. 5 FATHER ( Preparing a difficult shot ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were here a minute ago . They 're out playing somewhere Your coat on the ground ! Really , you 're as bad as Dodie . FATHER Well , you should teach the children  --  little trouble with the dandelions here  --  that it 's their first duty when their father comes home on Friday nights ( Shouts ) Fore , you bastards ! to rush toward their father to grovel abject thanks to him who gave them life . MOTHER ( Amused exasperation ) : Oh , stop that nonsense ! FATHER On Friday nights after a week of toil at the office a man wants to see ( He swings ) his wives and children clinging to his knees , tears pouring down their cheeks . ( He stands up very straight , holding an enormous silver cup ) Gentlemen , I accept this championship cup , but I wish also to give credit to my wife and children , who drove me out of the house every Sunday morning Where are the children ? Caroline ! Dodie ! MOTHER Oh , they 're hiding somewhere . p. 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're playing one of those awful games of theirs . Listen to me , Fred : those games are morbid ; they 're dangerous . FATHER How do you mean , dangerous ? MOTHER Really ! No one told me when I was a bride that children are half crazy . I only hear fragments of the games , naturally , but do you realize that they like nothing better than to imagine us  --  away ? FATHER Away ? MOTHER Yes  --  dead ? FATHER ( His eye on the shot ) : One two three ! Well , you know what you said . MOTHER What did I say ? FATHER Your dream . MOTHER Pshaw ! FATHER ( Softly , with lowest insinuation ) : Your dream that you and I on a Mediterranean cruise MOTHER It was Hawaii . FATHER And that we were  --  ahem !  --  somehow alone . MOTHER Well , I did n't imagine them dead ! I imagined them with Mother or Paul or their Aunt Henrietta . p. 7 FATHER ( Piously ) : I hope so . MOTHER You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She 's the one who starts it all . And afterwards she has those nightmares . Come in . You 'll see the children at supper . FATHER ( Looking upward ) : What has the weatherman predicted for tomorrow ? MOTHER ( Starting for the house ) : Floods . Torrents . You 're going to stay home from the golf club and take care of the children . And I 'm going to the Rocky Mountains and to China . FATHER You 'll be back by noon . What does Caroline say in her nightmares ? MOTHER Oh ! When she 's awake , too . You and I are  --  away . Do you realize that that girl is mad about black gloves ? FATHER Nonsense . MOTHER Caroline would be in constant mourning if she could manage it . Come in , come in . You 'll see them at supper . ( She goes out ) FATHER ( He strolls to the end of the stage farthest from the house and calls ) : Caroline ! ( Pause ) Dodie ! ( Pause ) Bill-eeee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the distance . ) No instrument has yet been discovered that can read what goes on in another 's mind , asleep or awake . And I hope there never will be . But once in a while , it would help a lot . Is it wrong of me to wish that just once I could be an invisible witness to one of my children 's dreams , to one of their games ? ( He calls again ) Caroline ! ( We are in the game which is a dream . The children enter as he calls them , but he does not see them and they do not see him . They come in and stand shoulder to shoulder as though they were about to sing a song before an audience . Caroline carries a child 's suitcase and one of her mother 's handbags ; she is wearing black gloves . Dodie also has a suitcase and handbag , but no gloves. ) p. 8 CAROLINE Dodie ! Hurry before they see us . FATHER Dodie ! DODIE Where 's Billee gone ? FATHER ( Being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Billee ! ( Father enters the house . Mother glides out of the house and takes her place at the farther end of the stage and turns and faces the children . She is wearing a black hat , deep black veil and black gloves . Her air is one of mute acquiescent grief . Caroline glances frequently at her mother as though for prompting . A slight formal pause . ) CAROLINE I guess , first , we have to say how sorry we are . ( To Mother ) Shall we begin ? ( Mother lowers her head slightly ) This first part is in church . Well , in a kind of church . And there 's been a perfectly terrible accydent , an airplane accydent . DODIE ( Quickly ) : No , it was an automobile accydent . CAROLINE ( Ditto ) : It was an airplane . DODIE ( Ditto ) : I do n't want it to be an airplane . BILLEE ( Fiercely ) : It was on a ship . It was a big shipwreck . p. 9 CAROLINE Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be quiet . It was an airplane accydent . And They were on it , and they 're not here any more . BILLEE They got dead . CAROLINE ( Glaring at him ) : Do n't say that word . You promised you would n't say that word . ( Uncomfortable pause ) And we 're very sad . And DODIE ( Brightly ) : We did n't see it , though . CAROLINE And we 'd have put on black dresses , only we have n't got any . But we want to thank Miss Wilkerson for coming today and for wearing black like she 's wearing . ( Mother again lowers her head ) Miss Wilkerson is the best teacher in Benjamin Franklin School , and she 's the grown-up we like best . BILLEE ( Suddenly getting excited ) : That 's not Miss Wilkerson . That 's  --  I mean  --  look ! CAROLINE I ca n't hear a word you 're saying , and anyway , do n't talk now ! BILLEE ( Too young to enter the dream ; pulling at his sisters ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's Mama ! p. 10 DODIE What 's the matter with your eyes ? CAROLINE Mama 's not here any more . She went away . BILLEE ( Staring at Mother , and beginning to doubt ) : It 's Mrs. Fenwick ! CAROLINE ( Low but strongly ) : No-o-o-o ! ( Resuming the ceremony ) It was n't so sad about Grandma , because she was more'n a hundred anyway . DODIE And she used to say all the time , " I wo n't be with you always , " and things like that , and how she 'd give Mama her pearl pin . BILLEE I guess she 's glad she is n't any more . CAROLINE ( Uncertainly ) : So DODIE ( To Mother , with happy excitement ) : Are we orphans now  --  real orphans ? ( Mother , always with lowered eyes , nods slightly ) And we do n't have to do things any more ? CAROLINE ( Severely ) : Dodie ! Do n't say everything . ( She consults her mother ) What do I say now ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11 CAROLINE Yes . Papa was a very fine man . And DODIE ( Quickly ) : He used to swear bad words . BILLEE ( Excitedly ) : All the time ! He 'd swear swearwords . CAROLINE Well , maybe a little . DODIE He did . I used to want to die . CAROLINE Well , nobody 's perfeck ( Slower ) He was all right , sometimes . DODIE He used to laugh too loud in front of people . And he did n't give Mama enough money to buy clothes . She had to go to town in rags , in terrible old rags . BILLEE ( Always excited ) : Papa 'd go like this , ( Pumping his arms up and down in desperation ) " I have n't got it ! I have n't got it ! You ca n't squeeze blood out of a stone . " DODIE Yes , he did . BILLEE And Mama 'd say : " I 'm ashamed to go out in the street . " It was awful . And then he 'd say , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll have to do . " CAROLINE Billee ! How can you say such an awful word ? Do n't you ever say that again . Papa was n't perfeck , but he would never have done a mortgage . p. 12 BILLEE Well , that 's what he said . CAROLINE ( Emphatically ) : Most times Papa did his best . Everybody makes some mistakes . DODIE ( Demurely ) : He used to drink some , too . BILLEE ( Beside himself again ) : He used to drink oceans . And Mama 'd say , " Do n't you think you 've had enough ? " and he 'd say , " Down the hatch ! " DODIE Yes , he did . And , " Just a hair of the dog that bit him . " And Mama 'd say , " Well , if you want to kill yourself before our eyes ! " I used to want to die . CAROLINE Billee , do n't get so excited ; and you too , Dodie . Papa was a very fine man , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever say anything very inneresting . DODIE He was inneresting when he told about the automobile accydent he 'd seen and all the blood . BILLEE Yes , he was . But he stopped in the middle when Mama said , " Not before the children . " DODIE Yes , he stopped then . CAROLINE Anyway , we 're very sad . And ( She looks to her mother for prompting ) p. 13 MOTHER ( Almost inaudibly ) : Your mother CAROLINE Yes . About Mama . BILLEE ( Hot indignation ) : Mama 's almost never home . She 's always shopping and having her hair made . And one time she was away years , to see Grandma in Boston . DODIE It was only five days , and Grandma was very sick . BILLEE No , it was n't . It was years and years . DODIE Well , when she was away she did n't have to say Do n't  --  Do n't  --  Do n't all the time , all day and night , Do n't  --  Do n't  --  Do n't . BILLEE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things to eat . DODIE Beans and mash potatoes , and I just hate them . " Now , you eat every mouthful , or you do n't leave the table . " Ugh ! CAROLINE ( Recalling them to the ceremony ) : It was n't her fault ! Only she did n't unnerstand children . I guess there 's not one in a hundred hundred that unnerstands children . ( To Mother ) Is that enough , Miss Wilkerson ? I ca n't think of anything else to say . And we 've got to hurry , or Uncle Paul will come to get us , or Aunt Henrietta , or somebody even worse . So can we go now ? p. 14 MOTHER ( A whisper ) : I think it would be nice , you know , if you said how you loved them , and how they loved you . CAROLINE Yes  --  uh DODIE It was awful when they got huggy and kissy . And when we got back an hour late , from Mary Louise 's picnic , and Mama said , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what had become of you . " CAROLINE ( Slowly ) : She liked us best when we were sick and when I broke my arm . DODIE Yes . ( Exhausted pause ) Miss Wilkerson , orphans do n't have to be sad all the time , do they ? ( Mother shakes her head slightly . ) BILLEE Do we get any money for being orphans ? CAROLINE We wo n't need it . Papa used to keep an envelope behind the clock with money in it , for accydents and times like that . I have it here . ( She goes to Mother , like a hostess getting rid of a guest ) Thank you for coming , Miss Wilkerson . We have to go now . And thank you for wearing black . DODIE ( Also shaking hands ; conventionally ) : Thank you very much . ( Mother , with bowed head , glides into the house. ) p. 15 CAROLINE Now be quiet , and I 'll tell you what we 're going to do . We 've got to hurry , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't have anybody around us or near us and we 're going to take a bus . ( Sensation ) All over the world . We 're going to be different persons and we 're going to change our names . ( Gravely she opens her suitcase . She takes out and puts on a hat and fur neckpiece of her mother 's . She looks adorable ) I 'm Mrs. Arizona . Miss Wilson , please get ready for the trip . DODIE Wha-a-t ? CAROLINE Miss Wilson ! Will you put your hat on , please . DODIE Oh ! ( She puts on a hat from her suitcase ) I want to be married , too . I want to be Mrs. Wilson . CAROLINE You 're too young . People would laugh at you . We 'll be gone for years and years , and by and by , in China or somewhere , you can gradually be Mrs. Wilson . BILLEE I want to be somebody , too . CAROLINE You 're only eight ! If you do n't cry all the time and say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now we can start . BILLEE But are n't Papa and Mama coming ? ( The girls turn and glare at him ) Oh ! they 're dead . ( More glaring ) p. 16 CAROLINE All right . S-s-stay at home and go to s-s-school , if you want to . Papa and Mama are happy . Papa 's playing golf and Mama 's shopping . Are you ready , Miss Wilson ? DODIE Yes , Mrs. Arizona , thank you . CAROLINE Do n't run , but if we hurry we can each get a seat by the window . ( Father enters , wearing a bus conductor 's cap and big dark glasses . He casually arranges the chairs so as to indicate some of the seats of a long bus pointing toward the exit through the audience . The children form a line at the door of the bus , tickets in hand . ) FATHER Take your places in line , please . The first stop , ladies and gentlemen , will be Ashagorra-Kallapalla , where there will be twenty minutes for lunch . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heaven-fruit sandwich . ( He starts punching the tickets of some imaginary passengers who precede the children . ) That cat wo n't be happy , madam . That 's our experience . ( Severely , palping a passenger ) You have n't got mumps , have you ? Well , I 'd appreciate it if you sat at a distance from the other passengers . BILLEE ( Staggered ) : But that 's Papa ! DODIE Do n't be silly , Papa 's away . p. 17 BILLEE But it looks like Papa and ( Losing assurance ) it looks like Dr. Summers , too . CAROLINE Billee , I do n't know what 's the matter with you . Papa would n't be working as a bus conductor . Papa 's a man that 's got more money than that . FATHER ( To Caroline ) : Your ticket , please , madam . CAROLINE We want to go to all the places you 're going to , please . FATHER But you mean this to be a round-trip ticket , do n't you ? You 're coming back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; her eyes avoiding his ) : Well , maybe I wo n't . FATHER ( Lowering his voice , confidentially ) : I 'll punch it on the side here . That 'll mean you can use it , whenever you want , to come back here . ( Caroline takes her place on the bus . ) ( Mother glides in and takes her place in the line behind Billee . She is now wearing a brown hat and a deep brown veil . Father punches Dodie 's ticket . ) Why , I think I 've seen your face before , madam . Were n't you in that terrible automobile accident  --  blood all over the road and everything ? p. 18 DODIE ( Embarrassed ; low ) : No , no , I was n't . FATHER Well , I 'm glad to hear that . ( Dodie takes her seat behind Caroline ) ( To Billee , punching his ticket ) And what 's your name , sir , if I may ask ? BILLEE Billee . CAROLINE ( Officiously ) : His name is Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Man to man , with a touch of severity ) No smoking in the first six rows , watch that , and ( Significant whisper ) there 'll be no liquor drinking on this bus . I hope that 's understood . ( Billee , considerably intimidated , takes his place behind Dodie . During the following he sees Mother and stares at her in amazement ) ( Father punches Mother 's ticket , saying in sad condolence ) : I hope you have a good trip , ma'am . I hope you have a good trip . MOTHER ( A whisper ) : Thank you . ( She takes a place in the last row ) CAROLINE ( Rummaging in her handbag ) : Would you like a candy bar , Miss Wilson and Mr. Wentworth ? p. 19 DODIE Thank you , Mrs. Arizona , I would . BILLEE Look ! LOOK ! That 's Mama ! DODIE Stop poking me . It 's not . It 's not . FATHER Well , now , all aboard that 's going to go . ( He climbs on the bus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rises and addresses the passengers weightily ) Before we start , there are some things I want to say about this trip . Bus travel is not easy . I think you 'll know what I mean , Mrs. Arizona , when I say that it 's like family life : we 're all stuck in this vehicle together . We go through some pretty dangerous country , and I want you all to keep your heads . Like when we go through the Black Snake Indian territory , for instance . I 've just heard they 're getting a little  --  restless . And along the Kappikappi River , where all those lions and tigers are , and other things . Now , I 'm a pretty good driver , but nobody 's perfect and everybody can make a mistake once in a while . But I do n't want any complaints afterward that you were n't warned . If anybody wants to get off this bus and go home , this is the moment to do it , and I 'll give you your money back . ( Indicating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be counted on . She 's made the trip before and she 's a regular crackerjack . Excuse me praising you to your face , ma'am , but I mean every word of it . Now , how many of you have been trained in first aid  --  will you hold up your hands ? ( Billee and Mother raise their hands promptly . Caroline and Dodie look at one another uncertainly but do not raise their hands ) Well , we may have to hold some classes later  --  go to school , so to speak . Accidents are always likely to happen when we get to the tops of the mountains . So ! I guess we 're ready to start . When we start , we often have a word of prayer if there 's a minister of the gospel on board . ( To Billee ) May I ask if you 're a minister of the gospel , Mr. Wentworth ? p. 20 BILLEE N-no . FATHER Then we 'll just have to think it . ( Lowering his voice , to Billee ) And , may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any bad language used on this bus . There are ladies present  --  and some very fine ladies , too , if I may say so . Well , here we go ! Forward march . CAROLINE ( To Dodie , confidentially ) : If it 's going to be so dangerous , I think we 'd better move up a little nearer him . ( They slip across the aisle and slide , side by side , into the second row behind Father . Billee has gone to the back of the car and stands staring at Mother . ) BILLEE ( Indicating the veil ) : Do you ever take that off ? MOTHER ( Softly , lowered eyes ) : Sometimes I do . CAROLINE Billee ! Do n't disturb the lady . Come and sit by us . MOTHER Oh , he 's not disturbing me at all . ( Soon he takes the seat beside her , and she puts her arm around him . ) FATHER ( As he drives , talking to the girls over his shoulder ) : It 's hard work driving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ? p. 21 CAROLINE Oh , yes . It must be hard . FATHER Sometimes I wonder why I do it . Mornings leave my house and family and get on the bus . And it 's no fun , believe me . ( Jerk ) See that ? Almost ran over that soldier . And  --  would you believe it  --  I do n't get much money for it . CAROLINE ( Breathless interest ) : Do n't they pay you a lot ? FATHER Mrs. Arizona , I 'm telling you the truth : sometimes I wonder if we 're going to have enough to eat . DODIE Why , I think that 's terrible ! FATHER And if I can get enough clothes to wear . I see that 's a nice fur piece you have on , Mrs. Arizona . CAROLINE Oh , this is old . DODIE ( Very earnestly ) : But at your house you do have breakfast and lunch and supper , do n't you ? FATHER Miss Wilson , you 're awfully kind to ask . So far we have . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things like that . Life 's not easy , Mrs. Arizona . You must have noticed that . BILLEE ( Big alarm ) : Mr. Bus Conductor , look't . Look over there ! p. 22 FATHER ( Galvanized ; all stare toward the left ) : Ladies and gentlemen , there are those goldarn Indians again ! I want you to put your heads right down on the floor ! Right down ! ( All except Father crouch on the floor ) I do n't want any of them arrows to come in the windows and hit you . ( Father fires masterfully from the hip ) They 'll be sorry for this . BANG ! BANG ! That 'll teach them . BANG ! ( Billee rises and whirls , shooting splendidly in all directions ) There ! The danger 's over , ladies and gentlemen . You can get in your seats now . I 'll report that to the Man Up There in Washington , D.C. , you see if I do n't . ( To Mother ) May I ask if you 're all right back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conductor . I want to say that Mr. Wentworth behaved splendidly . I do n't think that I 'd be here except for him . FATHER Good ! Minute I saw him I knew he had the old stuff in him ! Ladies , I think you did A-number-one , too . CAROLINE Does that happen often , Mr. Bus Conductor ? FATHER Well , you know what a man 's life is like , Mrs. Arizona . Fight . Struggle . Survive . Struggle . Survive . Always was . DODIE What if  --  what if you did n't come back ? p. 23 FATHER Do you mean , if I died ? We do n't think of that , Miss Wilson . But when we come home Friday nights we like to see the look on the faces of our wives and children . Another week , and we 're still there . And do you know what I do on my free days , Miss Wilson , after sitting cooped up behind this wheel ? DODIE ( Sudden inspiration ) : Play golf . FATHER You 're bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Who has been glancing at Mother ) : Mr. Bus Conductor , can I ask you why that lady  --  why she 's so sad ? FATHER You do n't know ? CAROLINE No . FATHER ( Lowering his voice ) : She just got some bad news . Her children left the house . CAROLINE Did they ? FATHER Do n't mention it to her , will you ? CAROLINE ( Insecurely ) : Why did they do that ? FATHER Well , children are funny . Funny . Now I come to think of it , it 'd be nice if , a little later , you went back and sort of comforted her . Like Mr. Wentworth 's doing . p. 24 DODIE Was n't she good to them ? FATHER What 's that ? DODIE Was n't she a good mother ? FATHER Well , let me ask you a question : is there any such thing as a good mother or a good father ? Look at me : I do the best I can for my family  --  things to eat , you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got some real pretty shoes on , ladies . But , well , children do n't understand , and that 's all you can say about it . Do you know what one of my daughters said to me last week ? She said she wished she was an orphan . Hard . Very hard . CAROLINE ( Struggling ) : Lots of times parents do n't understand children , either . FATHER ( Abruptly breaking the mood ) : But now , ladies and gentlemen , I have a treat for you . ( Stops the bus and points dramatically to the front right . All gaze in awe ) Is n't that a sight ! The Mississippi River ! Is n't that a lot of water ! MOTHER ( After a moment 's gaze , with increasing concern ) : But  --  but  --  Mr. Bus Conductor . FATHER ( Looking back at her and sharing her anxiety ) : Madam , I think I know what you 're thinking , and it troubles me too . ( Mother has come halfway down the aisle , her eyes on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in flood . I do n't think I 've ever seen it so high . The question is : would it be safe to cross it today ? Look yourselves  --  would that bridge hold ? p. 25 MOTHER ( Returning to her seat ) : Mr. Bus Conductor , may I make a suggestion ? FATHER You certainly may . MOTHER I suggest that you ask the passengers to raise their hands if they think it 's best that we do n't cross the Mississippi today . FATHER Very good idea ! That 'll mean we turn around and go back to where we came from . Now think it over , ladies and gentlemen . All who are ready to do that raise their hands . ( Mother and Billee raise their hands at once . Then Dodie . Finally , unhappily , Caroline . Father earnestly counts the twenty hands in the bus ) All right ! Everybody wants to go back . So , here we go . ( He starts the bus ) Now , I 'm going to go pretty fast , so sit square @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over his shoulder to Caroline ) I hope you really meant it when you put your hand up , Mrs. Arizona . CAROLINE Well FATHER You do have some folks waiting for you at home , do n't you ? DODIE ( Quickly ) : Yes , we do . CAROLINE ( Slowly , near to tears ) : But we did n't get to China or to that river where the lions and tigers are . It 's too soon to go back to where I come from , where everybody says silly things they do n't mean one bit , and where nobody treats you like a real person . And we did n't get to eat the famous heaven-fruit sandwich at that place . p. 26 DODIE ( Embarrassed ) : Car'line , you can do it another time . ( Caroline 's lowered head shows that she does n't believe this . ) FATHER ( Confidentially ) : Mrs. Arizona , I 'll honor that ticket at any time , and I 'll be looking for you . CAROLINE ( Raises her eyes to him gravely ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice ) : Mr. Bus Conductor  --  FATHER Yes , Mrs. Arizona . CAROLINE Do you get paid just the same , even if you did n't go the whole way ? FATHER I ? Oh , do n't you think of that , ma'am . We can tighten our belts . There 's always something . CAROLINE ( Groping feverishly in her handbag , with a quick sob ) : No ! I have n't got a lot of money , but  --  here ! Here 's more'n two dollars , and you can buy a lot of things to eat with that . FATHER ( Quietly and slowly , his eyes on the road ) : That 's real thoughtful of you , Mrs. Arizona , and I thank you . But you put that away and keep it . I feel sure that this is going to be my good year . ( After a pause ) Excuse me , may I put my hand on your hand a minute to show you know I appreciate what you did ? p. 27 CAROLINE ( Shy ) : Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respectfully ; then returns to his wheel . ) DODIE Car'line , what 're you crying about ? CAROLINE When you try to do something for somebody and FATHER ( Very cheerful and loud ) : Gee whillikers ! My wife will be surprised to see me back home so soon . Poor old thing , she does n't have many pleasures . Just a little shopping now and then . ( He tosses off a snatch of song ) " The son of a , son of a , son of a gambolier " I think this would be a good time to go back and say a nice word to that lady who 's had a little disappointment in her home , do n't you ? CAROLINE Well , uh Come , Dodie ( Caroline goes back and sits in front of Mother , talking to her over the back of the seat ; Dodie stands beside her ) The bus conductor says that everybody is n't in your house any more . MOTHER ( Lowered eyes ) : Did he ? That 's true . CAROLINE They 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do you think so ? p. 28 CAROLINE Children do n't like being treated as children all the time . And I think it is n't worthwhile being born into the world if you have to do the same things every day . DODIE The reason I do n't like grown-ups is that they do n't ever think any inneresting thoughts . I guess they 're so old that they just get tired of expecting anything to be different or exciting . So they just do the same old golfing and shopping . CAROLINE ( Suddenly seeing a landmark through the window ) : Mr. Bus Conductor ! Mr. Bus Conductor ! Please , will you please stop at the next corner ? This is where we have to get off . ( Under her voice , commandingly ) Come , Dodie , Billee . Come quick !
