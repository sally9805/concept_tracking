Contrary to most predictions , the 1966 primary elections were little affected by the obvious emotional issues of the hour . Huff and puff as they might , no candidates were able to whip up any meaningful support for antiwar protests . Nor was there any evidence of reaction against the Johnson Administration 's Great Society legislation . There were no measurable swings toward either liberal or conservative sentiment ; there was not even any contest between Kennedy Democrats and Humphrey loyalists . Nor did the new black-power militancy of the American Negro influence the voting to any great extent . <P> Last week 's primaries-in which a substantial sampling of 5,000,000 voters in a dozen states cast ballots for some 400 party candidates for statewide and congressional offices-marked the year 's largest single week of voting before the general elections seven weeks away . Thus the results suggest that , as usual in off-year elections , local issues and individual personalities will have the greatest effect on the outcome .                  @ @ @
