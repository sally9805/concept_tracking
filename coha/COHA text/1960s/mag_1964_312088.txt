Freedom of the press and freedom of speech were clearly established as constitutional rights in the very infancy of the Republic , when the ten amendments collectively known as the Bill of Rights were welded to the U.S. Constitution . Since then , the courts have refereed a seesaw struggle to define the line between freedom and license . Last week , in a landmark decision , the Supreme Court unanimously advanced the boundaries of press freedom-and of free speech-farther than they have ever legally reached before . <P> The decision reversed a $500,000 libel judgment against the New York <P> Times and four Negro clergymen in Alabama . But it did far more than wipe out the award . It defused a welter of libel cases brought by public officials in the South against assorted critics , including nine other cases against the Times . And by holding that Alabama 's libel laws are unconstitutionally broad , the court cast doubt on similar state libel laws all over the U.S. <P> The decision granted the U.S. citizen dramatic new immunity in the exercise of his classic right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conduct of public officials , the court ruled , is henceforth fair game , even if the criticism is misguided , unwarranted , undeserved or untrue . If the injured party expects to collect any damages , he will have to prove that the criticism was deliberately or recklessly false-in short , that malice was involved . <P> Inflammatory Language . No such caveats had discouraged the five public officials in Alabama who took offense at a full-page ad published in the March 29 , 1960 edition of the Times . Paid for by friends of Integration Leader <P> Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. , the ad solicited funds for Dr. King 's defense against charges of state income tax evasion ( he was subsequently acquitted ) . In language any Southern segregationist would find inflammatory , the ad stated that armed Montgomery , Ala. , police ringed a local Negro college campus to subdue a student civil rights protest , and later locked students out of the dining hall " to starve them into submission . " It also charged " Southern violators " with bombing Dr. King 's home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , always necessary in Alabama-or in many other states-to prove that defamatory statements are false or malicious . In some categories of cases , the defendant must convince the court that the statements are true ; otherwise , falsity and malice are presumed . This burden rested on the defendant New York Times . <P> Soon after the ad appeared , L. B. Sullivan , a Montgomery city commissioner , brought suit for $500,000 in damages . Sullivan 's suit was followed by four more : one from Montgomery Mayor-Earl James , two from other Montgomery city commissioners , and one from John M. Patterson , then Alabama 's Governor . Perhaps in recognition of his higher office , Patterson asked double damages , or $1,000,000.
