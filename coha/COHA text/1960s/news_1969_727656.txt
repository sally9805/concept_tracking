txt The New York Times ( 1 ) ) , Edward Hausner ) FACE OF HUNGER ; Reports that millions of Americans , like this child in South Carolina , suffer from malnutrition stirred the Senate last week into taking a rare step  --  it overruled a recommendation of its conservative Rules Committee for cutback and appropriated $250,000 for a major investigation into the problem . Hunger It Jolts A Senate Coalition WASHINGTON ? The quintessential issue of the half-declared war against poverty ? human hunger ? finally arrived on the floor of the United States Senate last week , and it was hard to find anyone , even in that august body of nay-sayers , ready to speak out for starvation . Only three Senators questioned restoring to the special committee studying " nutrition and human needs " the $100,000 that the Rules Committee had stripped from its $250,000 budget in the comfortable privacy of closed session . Senator George S. , the committee chairman , got his money back , and the nominally powerful Rules Committee was unceremoniously overturned . Few Firm Statistics Hunger had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been able to : upset the conservative Southern-agricultural coalition that has rarely recognized such a human condition . It was , very simply , a question of providing the poor with enough palatable food to stave off disease and death . Significantly , in a Congress that often seems to derive its own nutritional value from statistics , there were no real or imaginary figures about how many people go hungry . They seemed as superfluous as they were unobtainable . A hundred children with brain cell , damage from inadequate diet were as affecting as 1,000 or 10,000 . Senator , in pleading his cause on the floor , said there were " millions who do n't eat enough , not well enough , sometimes scarcely at all . " He does n't know the real figure ; even his refinanced investigation can only sample a piece of the national problem . What has startled some members of the committee is why the existing Federal programs ? hot lunches for school children , distribution of farm surpluses , food stamps exchangeable for groceries  --  have not reached into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem . Answers Appear In testimony last week , the answers began to appear , little by little . Some of the hunger victims are illiterate ; they have never heard of the programs and can not read the simplest notices concerning them . Others just do not have the $3 necessary to buy $48 worth of food stamps . In some counties , poor communities are overbalanced by larger wealthier areas so that the average income is too high to qualify any residents for the aid programs . In some places in the South , one witness said , economy-minded local officials regard this kind of welfare program as the most successful when it has the fewest participants . Despite this kind of attitude , the food programs have become considerable in size . The 1970 budget that Lyndon Johnson left behind calls for $338-million for food stamps , $367.5-million for child nutrition ( mostly hot lunches ) and $383-million for direct distribution of surplus food to the needy , a collective increase of $277-million over the year before . The principal criticism of these programs today is direct and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not feeding . But the reasons they have not been expanded more rapidly are more delicate , both political and social . Traditionally , farm state politicians have looked with some indifference on the various programs to help feed the needy . They have preferred to concentrate their efforts on price supports , which result in more income for their constituents . The proud and self-conscious South has been reluctant to admit that it was unable to take care of its own , particularly where the charges came from the North and had clear racial overtones . Together , these attitudes have slowed and sometimes stalled counterattacks against hunger at both the Congressional and local government level . Thus it was that a Senate Rules Committee under combined **26;1322;TOOLONG domination slashed the authorization . Reports that Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina proposed a cut from $250,000 to $25,000 gained credence when the committee insisted later that $100 , - 000 had been a compromise figure . A day before the Senate restored Senator 's money , Robert H. Finch , the Secretary of Health , Education and Welfare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the most he could say was he hoped to develop a new countervailing effort with state and local help . The committee is largely concerned with identifying and publicizing the hunger problem , rather than making substantive recommendations , and the form and immediacy of any Congressional relief remained very much in doubt . Senator Ernest F. Hollings of South Carolina provided the personal highlight of the hearings with a blunt confession that there was serious hunger in his home state , among both blacks and whites , and that he , as Governor , had pursued a policy of covering it up . His answer to the problem was almost equally direct : " We do n't need any more guidelines or studies or investigations . It would be much more economical just to go ahead and give them the food .
