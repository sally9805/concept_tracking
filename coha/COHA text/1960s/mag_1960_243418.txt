( See Cover ) <P> From the edge of the Elisabethville airport , black , handsome Moise Tshombe , president of the rebellious Congo province of Katanga , watched somberly as a white Convair circled slowly over his capital . At last the Elisabethville control tower gave the Convair permission to land but first warned that the seven troop-laden transports behind it must turn away . Back from the Convair crackled a curt message : Unless all eight planes were allowed to land , the entire flight would return to Leopoldville . Toying with a tourist booklet entitled " Elisabethville Welcomes You , " Tshombe ( pronounced Chombay ) hesitated briefly , then gave clearance to all the planes and stepped out onto the field to greet Dag Hammarskjold , Secretary-General of the United Nations . <P> As the slim , sandy-haired Hammarskjold marched past a Katanga honor guard , a crowd of several hundred Belgians and Africans set up a cry of " Down with the United Nations . " At the sight of the 240 Swedish troops , * the U.N . advance guard who , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority , " the crowd jeered again . <P> <P> But as Katanga jeered and Belgians fretted , most of the rest of the world cheered . New York Times Reporter James Reston called Hammarskjold " one of the great natural resources in the world today . " A Netherlands editorialist saw him as a " supranational figure , " Italy as " a world-famed arbitrator . . . who imposes his own will , " Japan as " the bridge between the reality of the world situation and the ideal of world peace . " <P> Behind most of these cheers lay the sense of relief expressed by a British diplomat who asked , " Can you imagine what the situation would be in the Congo now if it had not been for the U.N . ? " and promptly answered himself : " Intervention by the two superpowers and a dangerous clash between them . " Along with the relief ran pleased surprise at Hammarskjold 's positive achievements in the Congo and some concern over what he had let himself and the U.N . in for . In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to falter but in the end prevailed . He steadily pressured the Belgians toward renouncing their angry reoccupation of the Congo that they had so recently freed . He had kept the Congo 's erratic politicians , at least for the moment , from plunging their infant nation into civil war , and checked the threatened intervention of such pan-African adventurers as Ghana 's Nkrumah and Guinea 's Sekou Toure . In the process he had stretched the U.N . Charter into shapes undreamed of by its authors and established the precedents for vastly in creased U.N . authority over member nations suffering from internal convulsions . <P> Eighty-Two Obligations . The quiet man who has done all of this is a 55-year-old bachelor who was born in a lakeside castle in Sweden of a long line of aristocrats and intellectuals . Despite his athleticism ( mountain climbing , cycling ) , slope-shouldered Dag Hammarskjold has a mild and even frail appearance . He converses sedately in four languages ( excellent Swedish , English and French , adequate German ) , and when he sees a listener has got his drift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so on .
