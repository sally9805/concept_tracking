Railroads no longer grow by stretching new lines of track-they simply merge . Last week the U.S. got two new , big rail systems by merger . The Supreme Court gave final affirmation to a union of the Chesapeake &; Ohio and the Baltimore &; Ohio , which together will form an 11,000-mile system stretching through the East and Midwest . A few days later , the Interstate Commerce Commission approved plans for the Atlantic Coast Line and the Seaboard Railroad , long fierce rivals , to join . The 12,300-mile linkup , stretching through the Southeast from Florida to Virginia , will make the new road the second longest in the U.S. ( after the Santa Fe 's 12,900 miles ) . <P> Principally responsible for the B. &; O.C. &; O. merger is C. &; O. President Walter Tuohy , who this week also becomes chairman of the B. &; O. Tuohy , 62 , an elfin onetime coal salesman who outmaneuvered New York Central President Alfred Perlman in persuading B. &; O. stockholders to join with him instead of Central , plans to save $50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smith will run the new Seaboard Coastline Railroad , which hopes ultimately to save $38 million yearly , partly by eliminating 4,200 jobs along its frequently overlapping routes .
