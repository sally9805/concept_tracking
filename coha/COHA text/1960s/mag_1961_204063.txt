Carl Borgward is a builder of genius , a clumsy manager of a large enterprise , a dilettante in financial matters , and a lovable human being . <P> Thus Hamburg 's Die Welt , in an atypically Teutonic blend of business judgment and sentiment , last week summed up the exit of the grand old gadgeteer of the West German auto industry . With his Borgward auto complex some $48 million in debt , 70-year-old Carl Friedrich Wilhelm Borgward agreed to give up his positions as president , sole owner , chief engineer and designer of the firm he founded 33 years ago and built into the sixth-largest automaker in Germany . The Bremen city council will take over Borgward and its subsidiaries to try to save the 19,000 jobs-some 23% of Bremen 's work force-by turning Borgward into a publicly owned stock company . <P> What chiefly caused Carl Borgward 's downfall was the same disease that afflicted many another European automaker last year-an overestimate of the U.S. appetite for imports and a failure to foresee the rousing success of 1960 U.S. compacts . With U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Borgward optimistically spent $24 million tooling up to sell 15,000 cars in the U.S. last year . He sold only 2,000 , has an estimated 19,000 cars on hand , many of them shipped back from the U.S. Beginning last October , he got loan after loan until his credit ran out . <P> Fading exports were not his only trouble . A fine designer , he sometimes got carried away by his last-minute ideas . Production men and cost accountants were run ragged by his habit of adding strips of chrome and other gadgets to models ready for production . Even though his production got as high as 107,000 units per year , between 1949 and 1961 Borgward put out 17 completely different models in some 60 styles . Said one of his aides in rueful amazement : " Give him a piece of clay and before you know it Carl has another model . " He often tailored his cars to his own measurements , and since he was only 5 ft. 4 in. , tall men were often uncomfortable in his cars . On one car , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible for any normal-size person to fit in . Shrugged Borgward : " The seat was designed for the family dog . " <P> Nevertheless , Borgward 's freewheeling inventiveness often captured the public fancy . One of his earliest successes was a 1924 three-wheel truck , still widely copied . In the postwar years , Borgward put out the bestselling LP-300 Minicar , catching the bugmobile craze on the rise . If Borgward had concentrated on tiny cars , he might easily have dominated the mini-car market . But after he had sold 350,000 of them , he grew bored , moved on to expand his bigger cars-and failure .
