LEFT <P> Communist Party ( P.C. ) Leader : Waldeck Rochet , 63 Seats in old Assembly : 71 Candidates : 470 <P> " A party of order and political wisdom , " P.C. Boss Waldeck Rochet called it last week . No paradigm of classic Marxist militancy , the party jumped embarrassingly late onto the student-worker bandwagon and has generally . played a restraining role in the current crisis . De Gaulle made the Communists respectable by wooing Moscow and the East ; they like his foreign policy , but dislike his authoritarianism at home and remain the focus of anti-Gaullism among many workers , the poor and some intellectuals . Prospects : some increase in Assembly seats . <P> Federation of the Democratic Socialist Left ( F.G.D.S. ) Leader : Francois Mitterrand , 51 Seats : 120 Candidates : about 410 <P> A coalition of the non-Communist left assembled three years ago to oppose De Gaulle in the presidential elections , the F.G.D.S. has hung onto anti-Gaullism as one of its few unifying principles . Its member groups-Guy Mollet 's Socialists ( 74 seats ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) - still think more in narrow party terms than of broader federation concepts . Workers make up the main following of the F.G.D.S. With Mitterrand 's appeal waning , the Federation may lose some seats . <P> United Socialist Party ( P.S.U. ) Leader : Pierre Mendes-France , 61 Seats : 3 Candidates : 316 <P> Doctrinaire intellectual Socialist , the P.S.U. is largely the length and shadow of Mendes-France , the best-known and ablest Premier of the Fourth Republic . Mendes-France was the only important figure from the world of conventional politics to appear at student rallies throughout the crisis . He is the most widely admired anti-Gaullist and is regarded by the students as the nearest thing to an over-30 political guru . He is an opponent of the presidential system and the likeliest candidate to head a provisional government should the Gaullist Republic fall . With few seats in the old Assembly but many candidates entered , the P.S.U. should gain . <P> <P> CENTER <P> Progress and Modern Democracy ( P.D.M. ) Leader : Jacques Duhamel , 43 Seats : 42 Candidates : 255 <P> Another conglomerate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without notable success to be a tertium quid between Gaullism and Communism . The P.D.M. inherited the mantle of the Fourth Republic 's Christian Democratic Mouvement Rpublicain Populaire . Economically progressive , Europe-minded and pro-U.S. , the P.D.M. is still far from the balance-of-power position between left and right that the M.R.P. enjoyed , but may pick up more seats . <P> Movement for Reform Leader : Edgard Pisani , 49 Seats : 1 Candidates : 42 <P> The Movement is a new anti-Gaullist group formed by bearded ex-Gaullist Pisani , who resigned from the Cabinet over last year 's successful government bid for special decree powers to deal with France 's economic problems . His final break with De Gaulle came when he voted for last month 's censure motion . The Movement is the freshest Centrist answer to the Gaullist/Communist dilemma , with a program of dialogue , decentralization and economic planning . Prospects : Pisani expects to win no more than five seats , then build for the future . <P> RIGHT <P> Independent Republicans ( R.I. ) Leader : Valry Giscard d'Estaing , 42 Seats : 43 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
