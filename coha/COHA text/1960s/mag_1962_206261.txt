To hear the agonizing in Boston last week , you 'd have thought that Cardinal Gushing was running against the Pope-the choice was that hard . In the rough-and-tumble world of Massachusetts Democratic politics , where a moment 's indecision can make a roomful of enemies , politicians were struck by a sudden outbreak of public neutrality . The cause of it all was Edward M. ( " Ted " ) Kennedy 's long-expected announcement that he is a candidate for the U.S. Senate . That would ordinarily be a fine thing-except that Ted thus placed himself on a collision course with another dynastic figure : State Attorney General Edward McCormack , 38 , nephew of House Speaker John McCormack , who wants the Democratic Senate nomination just as badly as Ted . Groaned Democratic Ward Chairman Theodore Dimauro of Springfield : " This is the hottest thing that I 've ever been involved in . " <P> The politician 's discomfort did not seem to bother Ted Kennedy , who announced less than six weeks after he turned 30 , the legal age requirement for a Senator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directed traffic outside his nine-room house near the Charles River , he strode into his living room with his blonde , tanned wife Joan at his side . A young man held up large cue cards , and Ted faced a battery of microphones and television and newsreel cameras . Said Ted : " I make this decision in full knowledge of the obstacles I will face , the charges that will be made . Massachusetts must have a Democratic voice in the councils of the Senate-a voice that will be heard . " <P> Embarrassed &; Annoyed . What did Ted 's big brother think about that ? Though Ted had talked the matter over with the President , none of the Kennedys had tried to dissuade him from his course . A private poll had already shown that Ted would win in the primary by 2 to 1 . Asked at his news conference if he would give Ted his support , the President replied : " My brother is carrying this campaign on his own and will conduct it in that way . " Attorney General Robert Kennedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President might campaign for him after the primary . Ted himself announced that he did not expect any help from either brother . But anyone who knew politics-or the Kennedys-was sure that Ted would benefit mightily not only from the presidential image , but from the Kennedy money , manpower and influence . <P> Whatever help Ted may or may not get , it seemed sure that his candidacy would be no help to the President . With a third Kennedy ready to enter the national political scene , both Republicans and Democrats in Washington buzzed last week with renewed talk of a Kennedy dynasty . Some House leaders feel that the Kennedy-McCormack race in Massachusetts is already straining the President 's relations with the House , and may make it hard for him to work candidly with the men under John McCormack . Democrats , somewhat annoyed at Teddy , are sure that the race will be an embarrassment , no matter who wins . Republicans feel that in the dynasty theme they have found an issue to use against the President in the fall .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
