In commenting upon the exhibition on display last week at Paris ' Durand-Ruel Gallery , Critic Pierre Cabanne of the weekly Arts neatly summed up the fate of Impressionist Camille Pissarro . He is largely ignored , said Cabanne , " for not having the ardour of Cezanne , the sensuality of Renoir , the brilliance of Sisley , the visual sharpness of Degas , the fullness of Monet 's conception . " At first glance , Pissarro 's work does seem to lack the dazzle of his colleagues ' , but after longer study , the full truth emerges . Far from lacking the virtues of the others , he had them all under firm and quiet control . Indeed , he was a source of many of them . <P> Praise for a Primitive . In the 59 years since his death , Pissarro has been given few good shows , and when Pissarro is not seen at his best he is best not seen at all . But the current show , put on by the same gallery that championed the impressionists during their years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both taste and sensitivity . Even so , it has not been much of a success ; critical comment has been scanty , public attendance indifferent . As Cezanne once noted , Pissarro 's was a humble art-and people tend to leave the verdict at that . They do not complete Cezanne 's famous phrase : ' ' The humble and colossal Pissarro . ' ' <P> He was at one time the dean of the impressionists , and he was always the most beloved-a patient , gentle man with a long flowing beard and a heart as large as a landscape . He was a teacher with so great a gift that Mary Cassatt once said , " He could have taught stones to draw correctly . " Though he did not convert the young Paul Cezanne to impressionism , he was responsible for the perception with which Cezanne observed nature , and for his devotion to inner construction . When a pompous friend , expecting him to laugh , took him to an exhibition of Henri Rousseau , Pissarro astonished the gallery by praising the primitive warmly . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bourse for a fulltime career in art , and it was Pissarro who taught the young Van Gogh to open his canvases to the sun . <P> Error of Imitation . The Durand-Ruel exhibition shows him once again embodying all the currents of the great stream of impressionism . In his early paintings of peasants , there are the same firm , sharply outlined bodies that , in greatly developed form , became the hallmark of Renoir . In the solid structure of the landscape , there are the origins of Cezanne , and some paintings have Monet 's ability to dissolve substance into light . <P> His peaceful landscapes and bustling city streets never scream for attention or proclaim their mastery . But the mastery is there all the same . In his last year , when he could not easily get about , Pissarro painted what he could see from his apartment windows-the Tuileries , the Louvre , the Carrousel . In one of these , he captured perfectly the golden summer light of Paris . But he did it , as usual , in a humble and muted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look .
