Edward Albee 's new play , Tiny Alice , is the most controversial dramatic puzzle to arrive on Broadway since The Cocktail Party . Over lunches and dinners , from Keen 's English Chop House to the Forum of the Twelve Expense Accounts , the table talk of the town is Albee 's darkling play about a rich and erotic woman who corrupts a pietistic and virginal man of the church ( John Gielgud ) , seduces him into marrying her , then abandons him on their marriage night , but not before she causes him to be pistol-murdered by one of three confidants , including his superior , a cardinal of Rome . <P> Everyone is trying to guess what Albee 's Tiny Alice ( TIME , Jan. 8 ) is about , since for the most part the daily critics offered little help . " In such a play , " wrote Walter Kerr in the New York Herald Tribune , " it is easy for both author and audience to get lost . " " Mr. Albee has virtually ordered the critics not to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be obedient , " said Howard Taubman in the Times , sug gesting his own utter bafflement . " It is difficult to set down with any show of confidence exactly what he is telling us , " said Richard Watts in the Daily Post . " Search me , " said John Chapman in the Daily News . " In Tallulah Bankhead 's famed critical phrase , there may be less to this than meets the eye . " <P> All About Grumpy . All of which has not unduly saddened Albee . " I 'd rather have people talk about what it 's about than have nothing to discuss at all , " he says . " This play is not perfect . All plays have flaws . But I do n't think it is obscure . Brother Julian Gielgud is in the same position as the audience . He 's the innocent . If you see things through his eyes , you wo n't have any trouble at all . " But the playwright confesses : " There are some things in the play that are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the narrative symbolism of Albee 's quasi-religious exercise had become a game that might be called " Guess the Source . " There is a butler in it , for example , named Butler . Ah , so . When Marilyn Monroe was a starlet , she had a bit part in All About Eve . At a party in the film she called out , " Oh , waiter ! " , and George Sanders , at her elbow , said to her , " That is n't a waiter , my dear . That 's a butler . " " Well , " said Marilyn , " I ca n't yell ' Oh , butler , ' can I ? Maybe somebody 's name is Butler . " <P> When the audience first sees Irene Worth as Alice , the play 's only woman , she is pretending to be an old hag , wearing a mask and leaning on a couple of canes . " How do you do ? " says Gielgud to her . " How do I do what ? " she says . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Walt Disney 's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs . Ah , so , heigh-ho . Gielgud is Snow White , and sensual Alice is Grumpy . But is n't she really the Virgin Mary ? Does n't she wear the Madonna 's blue and hold him in the precise attitude of the Pieta as he dies ? So he must be Grumpy then , and Grumpy must be Christ . Which Walt Disney never even suspected .
