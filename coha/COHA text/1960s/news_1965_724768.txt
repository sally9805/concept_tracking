txt A Federal court ordered yesterday that , a legislative election he held Nov. 2 under a Republican reapportionment plan that had been invalidated by the State Court of Appeals . The ruling was a victory for the Republicans . whose prospects of regaining control of the Legislature were enhanced . They had enacted the plan at a special lame - duck session last December as part of a fourfold districting scheme . But the special three-man Federal court stipulated in a 2-to-1 decision that its action would apply only to this'year 's special election . Senators and Assemblymen chosen in November will serve for only one year , and there will be another legislative election in November . 1966 . Future System Unspecified The court did not specify what apportionment system would be used in future elections . But a source in a position to know the thinking of the judges said the Legislature would be expected to develop a plan complying with both the Federal and State Constitutions . Although an appeal to the United States Supreme Court is possible , it appeared unlikely that that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the November election . The election would be held in the event an appeal were pending . An overflow crowd jammed into a small , low-ceilinged room on the fifth floor of the Federal Court House in Foley Square to hear the arguments that preceded yesterday 's decision . When the ruling was announced a smile crossed the face of Donald Zimmerman , a Republican apportionment expert . R. Peter Straus , president of radio station WNICA , sat in the rear of the courtroom . He and his station brought the suit that began the protracted legal struggle over reapportionment . Straus ' Gratified ' Although he had opposed the use of the Republican plan this fall , Mr. Straus said he was " profoundly gratified " by the decision of the court . He indicated that his main concern had been that there be an election under some formula in November . The Republican plan chosen by the court is the one known as Plan A. It allots a larger share of the seats in the Senate and Assembly to New York City and its suburbs than does the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was the over-representation of the rural areas upstate and the consequent underrepresentation of the more populous areas of the state  --  that led the Supreme Court last June to invalidate the formula prescribed in the State Constitution . Both Plan A and the Democratic formula disclosed last week curtailed upstate voting strength , but the Republican proposal held prospective upstate losses to a minimum . The court ignored the Democratic plan for redistricting the Assembly , which has not yet been embodied in a bill or acted upon by the Legislature . The Democrats are now at work on a Senate apportionment formula , which is expected to be ready in ten days or two weeks . In effect , the court said that it had a clear choice : either // adopt Plan A. for this year or postpone the election . It elected to follow the former course , even though that meant going against a ruling of the highest , state court . Judge Sterry R. Waterman , who heads the Federal panel , spoke for the majority . He was joined by Judge Sylvester J. Ryan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the election should be held in November as scheduled . Judge Waterman issued the court 's ruling from the bench as soon as the lawyers in the case had completed their argu. ments , without discussing the issue with his colleagues . He spoke extemporaneously , with no notes before him . After reviewing the tangled history of the reapportionment case , he noted that Plan A complied with the Supreme Court 's ruling that all districts must be substantially equal in population to meet the test of the Federal Constitution . The Democratic - controlled Legislature , he went on , " has had since the date of its convening early in January until to date an opportunity " to replace Plan A with a plan of its own design , and " thus far has accomplished nothing . " Judge Waterman made it clear that the court was dissatisfied with the Legislature 's performance . He implied that if it failed to produce a satisfactory plan in time for the 1966 election the court might appoint a commission or a special master to redraw the lines of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is some purpose in taking away from the duly elected representatives of the people the right which we wish they would exercise and which we have given them every opportunity to exercise with respect to the Legislature which will be elected in 1966 is. of course , another question , " he said . The court gave the state until May 24 to correct several minor technical errors in Plan A. The court will meet again on that date to issue a formal opinion and order in the case . Judge Levet contended that the court should not have ordered even the interim use of a plan that had failed to pass the scrutiny of the Court of Appeals . He cited this passage from Reynolds v. Sims , the Supreme Court 's basic decision in the field of legislative reapportionment : " Clearly courts should attempt to accommodate the relief ordered in districting cases to the apportionment provisions of state constitutions in so far as possible . " Because no plan before the , court met both Federal and ' state standards , Judge Levet. said , the court should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the present lines , with ' Senators and Assemblymen to cast weighted votes in proportion to the population of the districts they represented . Valid Plan Ordered The Federal court had ordered the Legislature last July 27 to produce a valid plan of legislative apportionment by April 1 of this year so that it could be used in a fall election . At the December lame-duck session , the Republicans enacted four plans , called A. B , C and D. Plan A was the least favorable to Republican interests and D the most favorable to them . All four were signed into law and submitted to the court . Three Measures Invalidated In February the three-man panel ruled that only Plan A met the test of the Supreme Court 's one-man , one-vote doctrine . It therefore invalidated the three other measures , Then , last month , the Court of Appeals struck down Plan A because it provided for an Assembly of 165 members rathH er than adhering to the proIvision of the State Constitution I that specifies a lower house ; composed of 150 members . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? last Wednesday  --  and the Democrats set out to draft a plan that would jibe with the , rulings of all courts . Blocking Charged Republicans and some Democrats charged that the Democratic legislative leaders were trying to block the election when they conceded that they could not push a formula through the Senate and Assembly before the court-imposed deadline . Theoretically , the Democrats could still pass a districting plan by May 24 and submit it to the court before the final order is issued . Court sources said , however , that it was unlikely that such a plan would he substituted for Plan A at that time . The pressure of time results from the fact that election boards around the state must begin early next month to prepare for the balloting in November . WMCA argued yesterday that a special master could draw a new plan in a few weeks and irked the court to appoint one . The court decided , however , to adopt the proposal of the Rockefeller administration and use Plan A as the interim formula .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
