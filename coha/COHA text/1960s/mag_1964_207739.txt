Fund raising brings up questions of taste , discretion , prudence and donor psychology that stir heated debates across the land . TIME correspondents , sampling opinion among churchgoers and ministers last week , found that the " crasser " gimmicks of fund raising are giving way , but only slowly , to various forms of direct donation . <P> Bingo King Co. , Inc. , of Denver , reportedly the biggest maker of bingo equipment , says that business is better than ever before .
