txt The Board of Education 's " Statement of Policy " for the achievement of " excellence for the schools of New York City " gives bright promise of a new start . It is no more and no less than an order to the professional school administration and an appeal to the political authorities and the public to forget the fumbling , obsolete , disunited past and to create a better future . The statement should not be measured by the old yardsticks , such as the Allen Report or the Gross plan . It leans heavily on both , but is at once more cohesive , more practical and yet less confining than either . It assumes that better education and greater integration are complementary elements of the ultimate design . The key components of the new policy directive are : Preservation of the neighborhood elementary school for the first four or five years of formal schooling , depending on the individual child 's progress ; Abolition of the junior high school in favor of three or four years of middle school ; Establishment of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to collegepreparatory and vocational education . The underpinning of this evolving system would be provided by pre-school training and care , with the cooperation of professional and volunteer staff and public and private social agencies . More important than the organizational details , properly left as flexible as possible , is the Board 's insistence that none of the reforms can be accomplished by a mere re-shuffling of subject-matter . For example , the neighborhood elementary schools are to be held responsible for a concentrated teaching of the tools of learning . The new middle schools are not to be merely re-labeled junior high schools ; they are to work out the best available paths to " organized knowledge in the major subject areas . " The Board is dead right in saying that an end to the junior high schools is essential to the effort to halt the exodus from the city 's public schools of both white and Negro middleclass population . Another fine innovation is to move the most experienced teachers into those schools  --  the difficult ones  --  whose problems require superior teaching ability . A teaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity to make quality instruction the decisive ingredient of the reforms . No policy statement , however , is worth more than the paper on which it is written unless it is carried out with decisiveness and expertness by a staff determined to build for the future rather than to lament the passing of the status quo . Nor can the directive be translated into an educational renaissance without liberal financial support by local , state and Federal funds . The Board can not bring about either educational reform or integration in impotent isolation . Its call for creation of a " top level group " of key officials in education , housing and employment should test the sincerity of those who have in the past put so much of the burden on the ' schools alone . The Board 's policy statement invites men of good will and good sense , in and outside the school system , to put an end to the bankrupt quarrels and to work together to make the schools the key to civic health and civil justice .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
