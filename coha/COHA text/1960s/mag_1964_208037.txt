Committing the sounds of music to paper is like trying to bottle a moon beam . It is an elusive and often per- plexing art . The mechanics of inscribing notations , for one thing , is such a tedious and time-consuming task that for centuries composers and musicians have been searching for an easier and faster way of writing music . Now Brit ain 's Imperial Typewriter Co . Ltd. is of fering just that - a typewriter that types music . <P> Scheduled for world distribution some time next fall at a price of about $700 , the.Musikriter consists of a stand ard typewriter keyboard of 46 keys plus eight " elevation keys " that allow vertical as well as horizontal typing . <P> <P> The machine can be mastered in three weeks by an experienced typist , who can then tap out a symphony or a fugue at the rate of about 60 notes a minute . <P> Imperial Typewriter , which already has orders from 14 countries , hopefully sees the Musikriter as a great boon to composers , music publishers , orchestras , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brainchild of a short ( 4 ft. 9 in. ) , roly-poly , fortyish divorcee named Lily Pavey , who had only a year and a half of formal schooling . A former circus clown who could play 17 different musical instruments , she has spent the past 14 years developing her invention in a cluttered flat in South London . She hit on the idea one day while working as an invoice clerk to support her family . To relieve the boredom of the job , she took to singing while she typed and was suddenly seized by the thought : " How much more interesting it would be to type music than invoices . " She bought a secondhand typewriter from a friend and began years of figuring how to reproduce 8,000 chords with 46 keys . Biggest breakthrough was the idea for vertical typing , in which the basket of type and not the paper shifted up and down eight spaces , or an octave-an inspiration that struck her one day while riding up and down in a creaking elevator in her apartment building . She financed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends , and a $4,200 grant from the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation . <P> Lily has also perfected an electronic extra she calls a " multi-note rotating drum , " a device which audibly sounds the notes as they are struck on the keyboard . " If Beethoven had had this machine , " she enthuses , slightly missing the point , " he could have written a symphony in a week ! "
