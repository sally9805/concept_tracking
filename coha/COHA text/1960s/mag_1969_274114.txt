As if in a nightmare , the dreadful events of last summer seemed to be recurring . Across the bridges of the Vltava River , 68 tanks rumbled noisily into Prague . The acrid smell of tear gas hung over Wenceslas Square , where troopers wielding submachine guns faced angry demonstrators . Even the cries of the crowd had a haunting familiarity . " We want Dubcek ! " shouted the demonstrators , paying tribute to the man whose attempt to give Communism a more human visage had brought Czechoslovakia a heady , hopeful " Springtime of Freedom . " But there was a tragic difference . Last August , the tanks and troopers were Soviet . Last week , on the first anniversary of the invasion , the Czechoslovaks served as their own warders . <P> Crimean Warning . They had little choice . Three weeks earlier , Soviet Party Boss Leonid Brezhnev had summoned the Czechoslovak leaders to the Crimea , where he delivered a grim warning : If the Czechoslovaks themselves did not suppress the protests , the Soviets would send in their tanks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Day of Shame , " the Soviets kept their 100,000 occupation troops well out of sight , though they were poised to strike in the event the demonstrations got out of control . There were even rumors that archconservative elements in the Czechoslovak party might provoke serious outbursts in order to provide the Soviets with a pretext for another intervention . <P> Conscious of their country 's dilemma , Czechoslovak passive-resistance leaders implored the people to engage only in nonviolent demonstrations and to refuse to be baited into fights with the police . <P> Party Leader Gustav Husk , who replaced Alexander Dubcek in April , was also anxious to ensure calm-though his government 's threats against demonstrations only tended to increase the country 's nervousness . <P> Outraged Bystanders . Two days before the anniversary , crowds in Wenceslas Square clashed with police and troops , who seized on the mildest provocations-even catcalls or whistles-to beat demonstrators and hose them with water cannons . As the crowd around the equestrian statue of St. Wenceslas grew in size , ten armored personnel carriers inched slowly from side streets . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she emerged from a building . People tried to escape into shops and hotels . At the doorway of the House of Food , Prague 's leading delicatessen , a jittery cop shot a man in the foot . Bystanders were outraged . " If I could do as I wish , " cried a waitress to one of the policemen , " I would raise my skirt and show you my bottom . That is what I think of you . " <P> The following day , the crowds in the square were twice as large . As 10,000 Czechoslovaks , curious tourists and journalists milled about in the afternoon sunshine , the armored personnel carriers and water cannons appeared again . Without warning , the police suddenly began lobbing tear gas into the crowd . As people fled down side streets in panic , the cops pursued them , truncheons flailing . Before the streets finally emptied late that night , 320 people had been arrested and two killed .                   @ @
