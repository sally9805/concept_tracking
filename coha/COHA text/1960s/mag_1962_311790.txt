Last week the U.S. Justice Department withdrew its objections to MCA 's plans to take over both Decca Records and Universal Pictures , a Decca subsidiary . MCA , with its Revue Productions , is already the most successful TV producer in the U.S. Now the company is going to produce feature films , becoming a sort of instant major studio-and perhaps soon the biggest of all . <P> The Justice Department forced MCA to give up its huge talent agency earlier this year , but that loss is now described by an MCA executive as " a minor distraction . " To keep Justice happy , MCA has agreed not to grab any other TV , record or movie companies for seven years . This was intended to suggest the spirit of compromise . <P> The Justice Department clearly withdrew because Hollywood is becoming Unemploymentsville , with so many pictures now being made abroad . TV and movie unions appealed last month to the President and the Attorney General to let MCA have its way . " Now , " said MCA President Lew Wasserman , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear a site for a new 14-story studio office building , " we will see if Hollywood will become a desert . I do n't think so . But I could be wrong . "
