Like any round-the-world travelers , Gemini 5 Astronauts Gordon Cooper and Charles Conrad took some pictures to show the folks back home . The first photos released last week made a spectacular space travelogue , exceptionally clear and well-defined . From more than 150 miles up , the astronauts were able to get detailed shots of the launch pads at Cape Kennedy , the sharp relief of mountains and deserts , and incredible sights of underwater coral reefs ( see color pages ) . The more than 1,000 pictures that they took with four cameras* demonstrated anew the potential of space photography for scientific and military applications . <P> Some of Gemini 's pictures of East Africa and the Middle East gave geologists a broad overview of rift-valley systems produced by faulting in the earth 's crust . Other pictures , each encompassing hundreds of square miles , will be useful to oceanographers studying ocean depths , underwater formations and ice floes . By taking selective color shots , Gemini did far better than the Tiros weather satellites , which photograph indiscriminately and only in black and white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas , Gemini had at least one negative aspect . Instead of touching down last week within sight of the carrier Lake Champlain as planned , the astronauts fell short by 103 miles . Investigators at the Manned Spaceflight Center in Houston soon traced the trouble : human error on the ground , not in space . One of the controllers at Houston had fed incorrect information to the big computer system on the ground , which in turn relayed the wrong re-entry calculations to the shoe-box-sized computer aboard Gemini 5 . Said Howard W. Tindall Jr. , mission-planning and analysis officer at Houston : " After all , it 's only our second try at controlling reentry . We 'll prove yet that it can be done . " <P> <P> The astronauts themselves withstood the strains of flight and re-entry splendidly . Though they had been cramped into a half-sitting , half-lying position for eight days , they managed to do a couple of deep knee bends in the pickup helicopter , hopped nimbly onto the deck of the Lake Champlain and walked without wobbling . NASA doctors aboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down their throats , poked their chests , listened to their hearts , took their pulse , sampled their blood and made scores of other medical measurements . The first medical findings : the astronauts were in " wonderful shape . " <P> One Way to Diet . On the day after splashdown , they were flown to Cape Kennedy to begin eleven days of even more intensive physical checkups and debriefings . The exams showed that Cooper and Conrad were not so fatigued as the men of the four-day Gemini 4 . For one reason , the Gemini 5 astronauts were able to get six or seven hours of sleep daily after the first few crucial days . When they slept in orbit , their heartbeats dropped to the high 30s . As they maneuvered their spacecraft and performed experiments , the beats rose to the 60s and 70s , which is about normal for them on earth . During the critical retro-fire sequence before splashdown , their hearts raced to the highest of the eight days-180 . Still , no ill effects .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
