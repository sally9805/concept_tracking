On Braniff International planes , women passengers have a particular problem : trying to pick clothes whose colors wo n't clash with the vivid hues of Braniff . Since last fall , in a major departure from the traditional white or silver commercial airlines , Braniff has been painting its jets any of seven assorted colors : lemon , beige , ocher , turquoise , orange , light and dark blue . Aircraft interiors are a kaleidoscope of orange , yellow , blue , brown , grey , red and green . Braniff hostesses wear uniforms that include lime topcoats , pink and yellow or pink and blue shift dresses and hyacinth culottes , all styled by Italian Couturier Emilio Pucci . <P> Rash of Jokes . Inevitably , the hostesses have become known among Bonded birdmen as Pucci Galores . And the multicolor fleet has raised a rash of jokes , such as the one about the airport controlman who radioed a Braniff pilot : " O.K. , dearie , take off . " <P> The last laugh , however , seems to belong to Braniff President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year ago last week and is responsible for the color splash . Braniff is getting more attention than other airlines , and operating statistics show it . Passengers increased 18% last year to 3,370,000 ; revenues also rose 18% , to $129 million , and earnings were up 58% to $9,400,000 . Within the year , Braniff stock rose from $25 to $125 , and stockholders last week happily approved a two for one split . <P> Lawrence , who came to Braniff from Continental Airlines , turned to the color brush as a quick way to paint over a dowdy image . Between 1945 and 1964 , Braniff had slipped from fifth to ninth place among U.S. trunk airlines , was notorious for late flights , sloppy service and shoddy equipment . Its routes included everything from long flights to Buenos Aires to costly Texas puddle jumps , but the airline had not won a new route for ten years and was barely making money . " Flying had become a crawling bore , " says Lawrence today . " But flying should be fun-and colors are fun . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Lawrence hired while he was increasing his advertising budget from $2,500,000 to $6,500,000 , suggested colored airplanes , Lawrence leaped at the idea . <P> Nights &; Days . Much more than spray guns went into Lawrence 's new-look campaign . Braniff was the first U.S. airline to put into operation the relatively small short-run jet aircraft - in Braniff 's case the BAC One-Eleven - providing places like Sioux Falls , S. Dak. , with commercial jet service for the first time . Needing only a 48% passenger load for Braniff to break even , the 63-seat BAG One-Eleven has averaged 61.1% . In addition , Lawrence put Braniff 's four-engine Boeing jets on a new schedule of daytime flying and nighttime maintenance . As a result , they now fly 11 hours daily instead of eight , and Braniff 's profit sheets show the difference .
