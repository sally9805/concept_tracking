txt New York Sen .. Kenneth B. Keating ( R ) of New York said slowly : " On the major issues of the day , I believe a senator should vote his convictions without regard to political affiliation . " His first obligation is to his country . The second is to his state , and the third to his party . " The Senator was sitting in the aisle seat of a plane flying from New York to Washington , answering questions put to him by this correspondent in a seat beside him . He had come straight from the press conference at which he announced he would run again for the Senate in New York , but not in conjunction with the national Goldwater-Miller ticket . Record Recalled Now , his shock of white hair making him instantly recogniz-. able to others on the plane , he was relaxed and cheerful in his seat . Often tapping this correspondents ' arm  --  and notebook in emphasis , he spoke freely on his concept of a senator 's role , of his own record , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a progressive Republican , in the Lincoln - Teddy Roosevelt - Eisenhower tradition , " he said , almost thinking aloud , as the plane droned on through a cloudy sky . " But I believe in voting my convictions . I 've been reasonably independent in the Senate  --  somewhat more than the average . " Even when Eisenhower was President , I disagreed with the Republican position on some issues . " Wiretap Issue Did he consider he was sufficiently liberal to appeal to New York State voters more strongly than a liberal Democratic opponent ? " Well , " he said , " I guess there are some Democrats who could pass themselves off as more liberal than I am . " " I do n't go as far as approving every scheme that comes along to spend taxpayers ' money . " He was asked for his view on the issue of allowing wiretapping without a court order . Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy , the Democrat who may oppose the Senator in the New York race , supports a bill which would allow wiretapping without a court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do not agree that any wiretapping should be clone without a court order . " In all cases a court order should be obtained first . " ILabor Support Did the Senator feel he could attract labor support in New York State , where there are about 400,000 more Democratic voters registered than Repub-licans ? " I would hope that I get support from all sections of the community ? labor , business , agriculture , and all rightthinking New Yorkers , " he said . Mr. Keating declined to disclose the pattern of his upcoming campaign  --  his plan of attack or the issues he would stress . That , he said , would have to ? wait until he knew who his opponents would be . ( The Democratic state convention will pick its Senate candidate on Sept. 1 . Frontrunner is Mr. Kennedy . He is opposed by Samuel Stratton of Schenectady . ) Would civil rights be a majoi issue in his campaign , in the light of racial rioting in Harlem , Brooklyn , and Rochester ? " I ca n't see how it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Senator replied , staring thoughtfully at the seat in front of him . " I would think it likely that my Democratic opponent , who- ; ever he may be , would be apt to have very similar views to myself on civil rights . " I 'd think we would have no fundamental differences ? our records would be comparable . " This appeared to be the Senator 's way of saying that he has been a champion of civil rights , both in the House and the Senate . He was one of the coauthors to the administration 's Civil Rights Act this year . In 1957 , as ranking minority member on the House Judiciary Committee , he played a major part in the fight for the bill which became law in that year . State Position The Senator also pointed out that the 1964 Civil Rights Act has , as he put it , " almost no effect " in New York State .. The state already had laws on its statute books which were stronger than the provisions of the act . " Our public-accommodations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employment are too , and we have no problem about anyone being prevented from voting , " he said . " There 's nothing in the federal bill at all on housing , and nothing in it on the school problems we face . " In fact , the act takes an affirmative , hands-off attitude , in saying the federal government shall in no way assist in the movement of children from one area to another . " ? Commenting generally on the racial violence of recent weeks , the Senator said he hoped that it would not enter into his campaign . This correspon , ' it received the impression , resides , that the Senator perhaps thinks that the significance of the so-called " white backlash " vote in New York State may have been overemphasized . Would he raise foreign policy in the campaign ? . // Keating Clings To His Senate Record // The Senator , who gained nationwide attention during the Cuban missile crisis in October , 1962 , because of his repeated earlier warnings that the Russians were moving weapons . into Cuba , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " I think it of the utmost importance that a United States senator have wide experience in foreign affairs , and in defence . " Peace with justice is our greatest over-all objective . It 's the most important single thing there is . " Reasonable men differ on the methods to attain it , but one needs experience on which to base judgments . " Earlier in the day , at his press conference , the Senator had made in clear he regarded Cuba as an American problem , rather than a party one . Therefore , he said , he would refuse to discuss it in a partisan spirit . ' Party Unity The Senator was asked his opinion of the " unity " meet ' ing in Hershey , Pa. , last week between Sen. Barry Goldwater and leading Republicans including General Eisenhower and Richard M. Nixon . He was cautious in his reply . At length , he said ; " Apparently , considerable progress was made in achieving great unity . " There is more to be done . " Would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I have no way of knowing that , " he said . ? By now , Senator Keating 's opposition to the policies of Senator Goldwater is well-known . He has said repeatedly he can not support them . He gives every indication , both from the words he uses and does not use , that he will continue steadfast in his decision to run his campaign independently from the national ticket . ' View of Goldwater In his press conference statement announcing he would stand for reelection , he said that " the maintenance of the principles which have always guided me in public life Is more important than election to public office .. " That remains my position and no matter what the consequences are to me personally , I can not in good conscience conceal my convictions behind a facade of conformity disguised as unity . " Several times Mr. Keating emphasized that he " would not get into " the differences between himself and Senator Goldwater . " We have no differences personally , " he said . " I get on well with him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnson . " An examination of Senator Keating 's voting record , however , shows the depth of the differences between the two senators . Voting Studied Last April 19. a study of Republican senators ' voting records was issued , comparing how their votes lined up against the planks contained in the 1960 party platform . Issued by Stephen Horn , legislative assistant to Senate minority whip Thomas H. Kuchel of California , it showed that Senator Goldwater voted against the great majority of Republican senators on every one of 25 major issues . The issues included the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty , the UN bond issue , the Antarctica Demilitarization ' Treaty , foreign aid , the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 , the Kerr-Mills Health Bill , and labor , transportation , and education measures . In some cases , Senator Gold-. water was the only Republican senator to vote the way he did . Senator Keating 's office told this newspaper that Senator Keating had voted with the majority of his colleagues 24 out of the 25 times . The Senator is known to have made use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
