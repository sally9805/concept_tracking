txt President Nixon proposes a substantially bigger budget surplus than did President Johnson . At the same time he wants to institute a program of sharing federal revenue with the state and cities . He also is studying a plan to limit tax exemptions available now to wealthy persons . Information on these three developments came as a Nixon administration faced its " moment of truth " with the Democratic Congress and prepared to take the wraps off the new fiscal plans on the domestic front . Cuts in federal spending with resultant higher surplus , Mr. Nixon said , " will speak louder than any words to the business and labor communities and to the world that the U.S. is determined to bring a halt to the inflationary spiral which has seriously affected our economy these last four years . " Loophole closure proposed The administration will cut $4 billion or $5 billion off the Johnson expenditures . The details will be submitted shortly to Congress . They will almost certainly create controversy , and ultimate savings will , of course , depend on what Congress does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submitted a plan to the White House to cut back exemptions enjoyed by the very rich in income taxes . If Mr. Nixon agrees , the plan will go to the House Ways and Means Committee April 22 , when David M. Kennedy , Secretary of the Treasury , submits new tax-reform proposals . The committee timed its own hearings to begin April 15  --  the deadline for income-tax submission . The Treasury plan would set // *Tax reform high on domestic agenda // a ceiling on the amount of income that a citizen may exempt from ordinary taxation by means of existing loopholes . The plan is called LPT ? limit on tax preferenced . . In another development Dr , Arthur F. Burns , counselor to the President , declared that the government has committed itself to the controversial revenue-sharing plan originally proposed by economists Walter W. Heller and Joseph A. Pechman . As " one of several novel ways " of dealing With problems of poverty and the cities , Dr. Burns told a TV audience , " we are finally going to go to revenue sharing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we will move in that , . direction . " Dr. Burns indicated the administration will reject Democratic proposals to suspend the 7 percent tax credit on business investment . Critics assert it is inconsistent to ask Congress to continue the 10 per cent surcharge to brake inflation at the same time that the , government is giving industry a tax credit ( subsidy ) for installing new plans and equipment . " In a perfectly rational world , " Dr. Burns said he would agree with this , but he indicated that political rather than economic . considerations were influencing the administration . There had been a " fiasco , " he said , when the Johnson administration tried to suspend the tax credit and it was forced to ask for reinstatement four months later . .. Mr. Nixon has political problems of the ? greatest perplexity . Facing a hostile Congress he must use the normal arts of presidential pressure and ' persuasion . He has already triggered a big battle over Ideployment of the antiballistic missile under -a revised formula . Mr. Nixon can certainly Win this battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Senate if he goes all out . Four - party ' Congress But is it worth the price ? Mr. Nixon may ; decide to delay what looks like a struggle of ? pe first rank at the very outset of his " administration , and take the course of nego ! qiating with the Russians over arms limi*tion first , and perhaps come back to ABM later . Aides say he has not yet decided whether to go the full length in the ABM fight . . Another major question is how Mr. Nixon ' Will deal with divided Democrats . Theoretically there are two parties in Congress - but actually it is more like three , or four . Each major party has liberal and conserve-live Wings . The Democratic conservative bloc is chiefly in the South . Seniority gives leaders control of important committees . Shall Mr. Nixon play ball with Southerners on matters of civil rights ? Not to do so might endanger his legislative program . On the other hand , if Mr. Nixon woos the Democratic Southern bloc with favors and patronage it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the South . It will also end much hope of winning over black voters in big cities . Guess here is that Mr. Nixon will play the legislative game by ear , issue by issue , recognizing that Congress is run by shifting coalitions in which party ties are only nominal . Nixon ranks problems An even more difficult long-range problem is the allocation of domestic priorities , particularly between this nation 's dominant middle classes and the poor , symbolized by the urban ghettos . Mr. Nixon ranks his problems ( 1 ) Vietnam ; ( 2 ) disarmament with Russia ; ( 3 ) inflation ; and ( 4 ) other domestic issues . He is already fighting inflation by orthodox methods , raising taxes and cutting expenditures . No inflation has ever yet been halted without increasing =employment , and unemployment normally burdens the poor most . Cutting back federal expenditures may reduce funds now going into the chaotic welfare complex left by Mr. Johnson . More efficiency in administration could bring more relief for the dollar , but many sociologists feel that not enough is being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distributed will be the subject of intense Democratic scrutiny from now on . So the Nixon administration finally opens its briefcase and takes out its program . Every decision means debate and opposition . This marks the end of the honeymoon .
