HIGH SEAS <P> Snooping on each other is standard operating procedure for both the Russian and U.S. navies . The Russians scoop up garbage dumped from U.S. warships in search of intelligence clues , use trawlers loaded with electronic equipment off Guam and in the Tonkin Gulf to monitor movements of U.S. warplanes and warn their friends in Viet Nam of their approach . The U.S. , on the other hand , routinely buzzes Russian cargo ships on the way to Viet Nam for a customs inspection of sorts , tracks Russian submarines in the Mediterranean and elsewhere until they pop to the surface . Last week , however , this sort of jockeying on the high seas reached the scraping point . <P> When the U.S. aircraft carrier Hor net , accompanied by two submarines and some eleven U.S. and Japanese destroyers , steamed into the Sea of Japan on maneuvers ( Operation Crossed T ) , they knew that they would find the Russians waiting . Moscow likes to consider the Sea of Japan just a large bay of its naval base at Vladivostok . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian destroyer Besslednyi began cutting in between the maneuvering vessels , ignoring urgent warning signals to stay clear . In a game of " chicken " on the sea , it twice came to within 50 ft. of two U.S. destroyers dispatched to drive it away . <P> On the third pass , the Besslednyi scraped sides with the U.S. destroyer Walker , losing a motor launch and tearing a whip antenna off the Walker . Then it withdrew . Next day DD025 , a Russian destroyer of the heavy Krupny class , armed with two missile launchers , continued the contest of nerves . Again , Walker was one of two ships ordered to force it away . This time the Russian ship swerved directly across the Walker 's bow . The two ships brushed momentarily together , and the Walker disengaged with a six-inch hole in its hull above the waterline . <P> <P> No one knew just what the Russians were up to ; they may just have been harassing the American ships to challenge the U.S. Navy 's domination of the Sea of Japan , or they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class of Russian submarine that has begun operating out of Vladivostok . Washington issued tough-worded public protests but tried hard to play the incident down . The Soviet destroyers withdrew , at least for the present , to the respectable distance from which they usually view U.S. naval maneuvers.
