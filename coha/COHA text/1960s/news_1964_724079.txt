Wallace , a Democrat , promised a throng of 10,000 state rights advocates at an open air meeting today that he will campaign actively for the Presidency in 16 states , including Illinois . He said his objective will be to snare electoral votes from the Democratic and Republican nominees in a move to give his adherents the balance of power in determining who sits in the White House next year . He avoided calling his movement a third party and specifically asserted he is not heading any enterprise such as the Dixiecrat party of 1948 . But he made it plain that he is out to get unpledged electors or electors pledged to him in enough states to make such votes a powerful force in the electoral college .
