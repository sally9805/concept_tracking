Better Training for a Better Clergy <P> Time was when a young clergyman could expect his first pulpit to be a rural clapboard church whose faithful accorded him and his preaching unquestioning respect . Today , he is more apt to find himself confronted with spiritual drift in suburbia or explosive hatred in an urban ghetto-and every-where by growing skepticism about the value of religion . Last week the American Association of Theological Schools published a study that bluntly accused most Protestant seminaries of being ill-equipped to train clergymen for ministering to today 's world . <P> The survey was carried out by the Rev. Charles R. Feilding , professor of moral theology at Toronto 's Anglican Trinity College , and was based on a sampling of the association 's 140 member-schools . Entitled Education for Ministry , Feilding 's work concludes that seminary teaching tends to be evangelically uninspiring and professionally im- practical . Bible study is more often than not " bibliolatry . " Although much is said about making the church relevant , writes Feilding , " the greater part of the whole theological enterprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , preoccupied with the long ago . " <P> Urban Oversight . Despite the mounting problems of city congregations , the author adds , seminaries are in many ways still helping students prepare " for a ministry to whatever is left of small town society . " Although today 's sophisticated laymen expect something more from their pastors than dogmatic , take-it-or-leave-it preaching , Feilding says that " the teaching method honored in the school was the lecture , so the graduate not unnaturally sets out upon his ministry lecturing people . " <P> Among other reforms , Feilding suggests intensive field work in which students would spend more time ministering to specific situations of human need , such as in city hospitals or schools-a program that is currently being carried out by the Episcopal Theological School of Cambridge , Mass . He calls for more campus ecumenism : " The ignorance which even neighboring schools have of each other is often profound and permits prejudice to abound . " <P> Feilding also recommends that the seminaries and churches conduct ceaseless self-studies to make sure that their procedures , and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or industrial concerns could stay in business were they not to subject themselves to regular self-scrutiny , " he points out . Yet , " taking all the churches together , there are no agreed educational standards for the practice of the ministry . " <P> Nothing for Granted . Many churches in recent years have indeed launched their own surveys of the problem . The United Church of Christ will hear the findings of a two-year study at its General Synod in June , and the Episcopal Church last year launched a major investigation of its seminary education . Feilding notes that a few seminaries already " are taking bold and effective steps " to reform . For example , Chicago Theological Seminary , which is affiliated with the United Church , has thrown out its first-year classes in favor of intensive courses " to introduce the student to the concrete study of the problem of the contemporary church in the midst of changing social structures .
