The newspaper A.B.C . is an institution in Spain . Usually dull , always conservative , it is nevertheless the most widely read and influential paper in Madrid . Besides , as the semi-official organ of the nation 's organized monarch ists , it can justly claim to represent the government 's position that Franco will one day be succeeded by a King . Yet early one morning last week , security cops moved in on newsstands to confiscate all copies of the paper they could find , readers . It even was the grabbed first it time from that A.B.C . sidewalk had been banned since the fall of the Spanish Republic . It was also the first time that the government had used its new liberalized press law against any Spanish newspaper . <P> The four-month-old law supposedly ended 30 years of Franco censorship . There were one or two stern provisions in it , however , the foremost of which was that the government could confiscate anything it does not like and prosecute the author . And although the regime had not felt the need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before , fortnight ago it banned a book edited by Jos Maria Gil Robles , a Catholic politician , which said that Franco should be followed by a liberal regime , preferably a monarchy . <P> It was an editorial extolling the virtues of the liberal monarchies of Great Britain , Belgium and The Netherlands that landed A.B.C . in the soup . Instead of following the official attitude that a post-Franco " institutions " of the monarch must Franco regime , maintain the the paper praised Don Juan de Borbn y Battenberg , chief pretender to the throne , for promoting " a European monarchy , a democratic monarchy , a popular monarchy , a monarchy for all . " Such thoughts are apparently still heresy in Franco 's liberalized Spain .
