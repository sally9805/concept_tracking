Improving the Australian economy was hardly a major aim in the life of John L. Lewis , but that is just what he did . In 1954 , with their antiquated industry slumping badly , Australian coalmine owners and union leaders journeyed to the U.S. in search of a solution . Naturally , they dropped in on the longtime leader of the United Mine Workers . He urged that they mechanize their mines , as the U.S. was doing with U.M.W. support . " Do you believe in slavery ? " asked Lewis . " No ? Well , then , it 's better to have 10,000 contented workers than 20,000 men working like pick-and-shovel slaves . That 's what mechanization means . " Recalls Sir Edward E. Warren , 68 , Australia 's biggest mine operator : " That was the great breakthrough . We came back home , and mechanization went straight in . " <P> Before that breakthrough , in spite of huge and largely untapped coalfields , Australia imported coal from as far away as South Africa , still suffered power blackouts when supplies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power needs are generated by coal , there is ample coke for the continent 's expanding steel industry , and a quarter of last year 's record 50-million-ton coal production was available for export . <P> Coal 's resurgence , which played a big part in the sturdy growth of the entire Australian economy , is due to complete modernization of the industry . Last week Sir Edward Warren announced that his Coal &; Allied Industries Ltd. would open a new mine in Cessnock , 80 miles north of Sydney ; it will be worked with automatic equipment , including a U.S.-manufactured continuous miner , which is operated by three men , crunches coal seams with spinning metal teeth and can chew out ten tons a minute . Helped by government tax allowances , mine owners have so far spent $236 million on such new equipment ; 98% of Australia 's rich black coal is now efficiently mined by machine instead of pick and shovel . Mechanical equipment has trimmed the work force from 24,000 miners to 15,000 ; meanwhile , individual productivity and wages have both trebled . <P> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created a need for big new coal harbors all along the Queensland and New South Wales coasts . At Port Kembla , for example , an $11 million facility loads ships at a 2,000-ton-an-hour rate , has cut loading time from four days to one . Cheaper coal makes Australia a competitive exporter , principally to Japan , which last year took 7,000,000 tons for steelmaking . U.S. coal still accounts for 48% of Japanese imports , but the Australian share has climbed to 30% and undersells U.S. coal by $4.74 a ton .
