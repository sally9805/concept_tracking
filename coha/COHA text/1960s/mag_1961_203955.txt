As the circling DC-4 bounced through the tropical thunderstorm over Elisabethville , a cryptic message crackled down to the tower : " I 've got a big parcel for you fellows . " Minutes later , the parcel stumbled down the plane ramp into the eager hands of the tough Katanga gendarmes . It was Patrice Lumumba , blindfolded and shackled to two of his government lieutenants . The Katanga cops fell on all three , dropped them to the ground in a hail of swinging rifle butts . Then they flung Lumumba into a waiting Jeep . With four gendarmes sitting on him , Lumumba was whisked off to a new and secret jail . <P> Though temporarily humiliating , the abduction was actually a testament to Lumumba 's burgeoning strength . Congolese President Joseph Kasavubu took alarm when he visited Lumumba in Camp Hardy , only 86 miles from Leopoldville , where he was technically incarcerated by order of Colonel Joseph Mobutu . Kasavubu found Lumumba with the run of the camp and energetically subverting the loyalty of the troops guarding him . For a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Kasavubu who was the prisoner . When order was restored , Kasavubu decided that it was time to move Lumumba to a safer place . He opened negotiations with Katanga 's Moise Tshombe . Late one night Lumumba was hustled on board a chartered Air Congo plane and delivered to Elisabethville . En route , the guards pummeled Lumumba so severely that the alarmed pilot went back to the cabin to warn against damage to the plane . <P> But Lumumba 's partisans pushed on . From Stanleyville , Lumumba 's old friend and former Vice Premier , Antoine Gizenga , probed westward into Equator province , where his patrols terrorized isolated white communities , roughed up some missionaries , rifled mission collection boxes . Arms and supplies came from Gamal Abdel Nasser 's U.A.R. troops , who man a U.N . base in Equator . The head of the U.N . Congo force , India 's Rajeshwar Dayal , seemed to be at least tacitly helping the Lumumba cause . In northern Katanga , where Gizenga 's troops marched into a U.N.-protected " neutral zone " unimpeded by Dayal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as permanent occupiers ; many U.N . unit commanders were grumbling that their orders from Dayal clearly were aiding the pro-Lumumba side . <P> In Stanleyville Antoine Gizenga 's men arrested twelve Belgians , talked darkly of " getting even " for Lumumba 's transfer to a Katanga prison . When local whites paid $10,000 ransom to free the twelve , Gizenga 's agents , seeing a lucrative business , simply arrested 40 more . Belgium promptly massed two battalions along the border in Ruanda-Urundi , warned that if the captives were harmed , the troops would march in to rescue them . <P> After seven months , the Congo seemed right back where it started .
