A faith healer , as loyal TV watchers know , is likely to be a hot-eyed spellbinder , his eye cocked to the collection plate and his theology about as solidly grounded as his gospel tent . But in Philadelphia a fortnight ago , the suffering who came forward to be healed-a retarded girl of about six , an old man with an ugly facial growth-received a blessing as dignified as the setting : 139-year-old St. Stephen 's Episcopal Church . " This is no hocus-pocus , " said St. Stephen 's Rector Alfred Price from the pulpit . " This is a sacrament you are about to receive-the sacrament of healing . " <P> Episcopalian Price has been holding weekly healing services since 1942 . He is warden of the Order of St. Luke the Physician , a group of clergy and laymen , including physicians , who take literally St. James 's injunction : " Is any among you sick ? Let him call for the elders of the church and let them pray over him . " The order insists that " spiritual healing " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , traditionally chary of faith cures . Dominated by Episcopalians , the interdenominational Order of St. Luke exudes a well-bred approach that would shock Oral Roberts out of his snap-on microphone . There are no mountains of crutches or grandiose claims to prospective customers . Miracles are rarely mentioned . <P> The Strength to Live . Although operating with the approval of their bishops . St. Luke ministers usually offer a separate healing service in order to avoid offending regular churchgoers who are " not ready " for the emphasis on healing . They attempt to heal the mind and spirit as well as the body . A minister often considers his prayers answered if the sufferer is given the strength to live with his affliction . <P> Episcopal faith healers acknowledge the efficacy of modern medicine and recognize that many " cures " are of psychosomatic illnesses . Explains St. Stephen 's Price : " The balance of body , mind and soul is upset , and sickness follows . We can pray , and with God 's help we can restore the proper balance . " Conversely , doctors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often flagrantly omits : compassion and hope . At the order 's recent meeting , Surgeon William Standish Reed spoke scathingly of hospitals that are " empires of stone , science and machinery , where the patient is the last to be considered . " <P> Steamed Up . The Order of St. Luke was founded in 1947 by Dr. John Gayner Banks of San Diego 's St. Luke 's Episcopal Church . When Banks died in 1955 , his widow took over the editorship of the St. Luke magazine , Sharing , and Price became the order 's warden . According to Ethel Banks , the number of U.S. churches offering healing services has grown steadily , from 14 in 1947 to 460 today ( about 95% of them Episcopalian ) . The order now has 4,200 members in 85 countries . <P> For all their soft-sell approach , St. Luke ministers get steamed up about the unwillingness of most respectable churchmen to pray for cures . Says Price : " No matter how we may look down our noses at some of those who use God 's power on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would take over this responsibility from them-not abandon it to them .
