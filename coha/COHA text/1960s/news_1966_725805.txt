txt Some National League pitcher will rock back and rifle the first pitch of baseball 's 1966 World Series toward the plate come Oct. 5 . Or will he ? Since it 's a " normal " year in the National League , nobody is certain about anything . The Dodgers , Pirates , and Giants are all bunched around the top of the standings . It 's a typical National League finale replete with a melee at the finish line . It 's quite possible that at least two of the teams will finish in a dead heat . That would mean a best two-out-of-three playoff  --  and mean that the World Series would n't start on time at all . Besides , the Giants were rained out of their final meeting with Cincinnati . And if that unplayed game turns out to be crucial in making a winner , the Giants will have to trek to Cincinnati to finish it up on Oct. 3 . That could push back both the World Series and the playoffs . When in the course of human events it becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States will be standing first in line . The United States Olympic Committee in fact holds this truth to be self-evident , that it would like to land both the Summer and Winter Olympics of ' 76 ? to help celebrate the 200th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence . The International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) is n't likely to cede both events to a single nation . But the United States will try anyhow . Detroit , St. Louis , Washington , New York , Philadelphia , Los Angeles , and San Francisco will probably all bid for the summer games . Denver , Salt Lake City , and Lake Placid , N.Y. , will likely try for the winter classic . The 1976 Olympic cities will be picked in 1970 . The United States hopes then that the IOC will sign its John Hancock to at least one American city 's declaration of interest . Trends ? ? ? Look again ! That figure pounding around the track at full gallop may be Dad  --  or even Granddad . The latest thing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senior Mile . It 's for men over 40 who have run the mile under 6 minutes . At least two meets in California this past spring and summer staged senior miles . Behind this middle-aged track movement is the Senior Track Club , a Los Angeles outfit organized early this year . It now has nearly 30 members ? including doctors , lawyers , and even a fire chief . Not only are these dads and granddads milers , but some have even run the 5- and 10-mile and other distance races . Their next step will probably be to put on their own track meets . Feature that , Grandpa just won the decathlon ! East Germany is flexing its sports muscles in the world arena . The East Germans have been stressing athletics over the past few years . And it is beginning to pay off in international corn-petition . In the recent world rowing championships in Yugoslavia , East Germans , competing with the best from five continents , won three gold and two bronze medals . In the last world championships only four years ago East @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Track and Field : hampionships in Budapest , East German zindermen showed surprising strength , The Germans have n't the numbers to iominate world sports . But they are sudlenly something to watch . Illiteracy is beating many Guatemalan athletes . Many of them are endowed with the magiificent physiques and endurance of their ndian forebears , but about half of them ! a n't read or write . At home , where the ' literacy rate is 75 percent , this has n't nattered much . But on world playing fields many Guatenalan athletes feel shy and inferior  --  not the lest frame of mind for a would-be champion . The National Federation of Athletics NFA ) is trying to beat down this problem . t has launched a school for Guatemalan thletcs . Guatemala 's bike racers are doing well Latin-American meets . So are Guateialan soccer players . A Guatemalan track tar , a swimmer , and several boxers are inning international reputations . Basket-all and tennis players have shown romise . It the NFA has its way , they may soon e able to write home about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
