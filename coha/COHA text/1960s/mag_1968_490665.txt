THE TALK . OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment THE advent of the Picture phone " within less than ten years , " which was predicted by the chairman of A.T . &; T. at a recent meeting of the New York Chamber of Commerce , fills us  --  after the automatic frisson that accompanies news of each step down the path of technological progress with rueful second thoughts . Apart from the obvious inconveniences that such an instrument will pose  --  subverting one of the most harmless and humane forms of twentieth-century lying  --  we fear that it will speed the continuing drain of what little is left of mystery and romance in life . Everything is too visible these days , and the result , we think , is a concomitant lapse in our other sensibilities . The major part of the history of man was transmitted orally , and what it lacked in hlack-and-white accinaey it made up for in vitality and intimacy . In our own history , we sometimes recall the whispered secrets of and ticklish as it is , will probably he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cold and slight -- I- ly promising . Glimmers Of peace in the air , and the flu epidemic on the wane , we decided to take one of our long walks . A few steps from our office , on Forty-third Street , between Madison and Fifth , we found that the foundation hole of a projected twentyseven-story building was empty except for Phelan Brady , a young , blue-eyed Irishmen , who is a field engineer for the Thi Inas Crimmins Contracting Company . " The drill runners took a vote and knocked off or the day , " Brady said , stamping his feet on the bedrock . " Ca n't blame them . In this weather , compression lines freeze and the jackhammers wo n't work , so what can you expect from human beings ? " Near the corner of Forty-fourth and Sixth , where the first six stories of a new forts -- four-story building have been erected , a dozen construction workers were having their lunch huddled around a propane-gas stove that sat on the floor of a windowless trailer van . " You ca n't weld @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreman told us . " All we can do is bolt the frame of the building together and hope for warmer weather , so the welders will have a chance to catch up . Trouble is , it 's too cold for the bolters , too . " On the third floor of the dwindling skeleton of the Astor Hotel , some workmen who wore scarves tied babushka-style beneath their hard hats were trying to keep warm beside a tin drum filled with blazing woodwork . Frank Pacella , who is the project manager , said that because of the weather none of the thirty steelworkers in his crew were on the job . " Look at that ! " he exclaimed , wiping a frozen tear from an eyelash . " How can ou expect anybody to handle steel on a day like this ? " At Sixth , we passed a tall , wraithlike man in a black overcoat who walked along with sprightly steps , carrying in one hare hand a long steel rod tipped with two metal prongs , between which was suspended a walnut . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was painted " ' FIE " and on the left " MAN . " Using a device in his mouth , he produced loud squeaks , like those of a toy mouse , and he turned and clipped and made motions of greeting to people he met on the street . There was no apparent purpose to what he was doing . Most people stared at him and said nothing . Three teenage boys met him crossing the street and read the words on his glasses , and one boy called nut , " Hey , Tiernan ! " The man danced on down die avenue , turning and bobbing and squeaking . We went into the Nediek 's at Eighth and Fiftieth  --  a yellowish , fluorescent-lighted room in which steam rose gently from coffee urns , and wavy lines of heat rose from rows of grilling frankfurters . Only three customers Sat at the counter . A waitress in a yellow uniform pointed out the window and said to one of her colleagues , a man in white , " There 's your friend . " " Where ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the waitress said . " just across the street . " The man looked out through the steamy window with a soft , indulgent smile , and said , " Yeah , And he walks just like / do when I 'm late  --  slow and sloppy . " Down at the Intergalactic Trading Post , in the East Village , we learned that the most popular " personality posters " of the moment were of Peter Fonda , Malcolm X , Cite Guevara , and President Johnson . At the East JANUARY 2 7 , I 9 6 8 ? Side Book Store , next door on St. Marks Place , the " Egyptian Book of the Dead " and the " Tibetan Book of the Dead " were both selling quite well . The East Side Book Store provides a community bulletin hoard just inside the front door . That dar , the hoard was dominated fit requests for transportation to warmer parts of the country : " Aquarius chick would like a ride to Ha . I have a chance to live on an island in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Sagittarius , Scorpio , Leo . " In Tompkins Square Park , which was deserted , the portable swimming pool that the Parks Department erected last year , at a cost of twenty-five thousand dollars , was filled with ice and dirt ) snow . At the Municipal Building , farther downtown , we dropped in on City Budget Director Frederick Hayes . He s suhmerged in a heap of budget requests from the city 's hundred and six departments and agencies . The welfare request was up a little less than half a billion dollars , to $1,395,000,0011 ; education officials were asking for an additional two hundred and seventy-nine million ; a hundred million more would be needed for hospitals . In all , the requests added up to what Mr. ? Hayes described as " a rather striking figure " of well over six and a half billion dollars . After a while , we were up visiting William Fuss , an importer and arranger of artificial flowers  --  mostly polyethylene  --  who makes his headquarters on the south side of East Fifty-third . His polyethylene plants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Jade Palace Cocktail Lounge and Chinese Restaurant ( near Third ) and as far east as the Pipers Pub ( near Second ) . Polyethylene smilax , which almost smothers the Jade Palace , creeps up the building until it reaches Harry &; Monty of London , Hairstylists for Men , on the second floor . A line of polyethylene rhododendrons , poppies , and dahlias leads east from the Jade Palace , past Le Pont Neuf ( a snappy French restaurant ) and Jose 's ( a snapp ) Cuban restaurant ) , into the shop of William Fuss himself , where it explodes into a riot of polyethylene mountain laurel , silk carnations , and velvet pansies , all of them overrun by a tropical profusion of polyethylene smilax . Mr. Fuss had decorated the whole block free of charge . " I want to make Fifty-third Street pretty-looking , " he told us . When we got up to the Metropolitan Museum , Olga Raggio , associate curator of Western European Arts , and Walter F. Rowe , master restorer , were in a workroom , bending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a wide hoard raised above the floor on cleats . They spoke quietly as Mr. Rowe wound thick ropes about the statue , tying it securely to the board . " She 's elegant , " Miss Raggio said . " I can hardly wait to see her standing up . " Mr. Rowe nodded . " It wo n't he easy , " lie said . " All those sharp folds in her gown are liable to chip if we 're not very careful . " The figure they were- talk-ing about was " Temperance , " a monumental sculpture exe-cuted in the sixteenth century in Florence by Giovanni Cac-cini , who was trained in Rome in the classical mode of the late Renaissance and returned to Florence to work for the Gland Duke Francesco de Medici as a restorer of an-tiquities . The heroic maiden was canmissioned by Bishop Giovanni del Milanese , for the garden of his house , on the Via Larga . In the auditorium of the Library and Museum of Performing Arts , at Lincoln Center  --  a wedge-shaped room with austere white walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty people , gathered to hear a talk by Sonia Moore , the founder and president of the American Center for Stanislayski Theatre Art Mrs. Moore , a gray-haired woman in a navy-blue dress , walked onto the stage and said , " An actor , unlike other artists in other fields , is the creator , he is the material , he is the instrument , all in one . " Her audience was utterly still and rapt Cornell MacNeil , a leading Verdi baritone , was to make his German operatic debut at the Metropolitan Opera as the sinister hero of Wagner 's " The Flying Dutchman . " We stopped by at the dress rehearsal and found him onstage , looking properly eerie in white makeup as he proposed marriage to &arta,; the demented daughter of a Norwegian fisherman . At the end of the third act , the Dutchman sailed off into space , Septa hurled herself over a cliff , and we wandered backstage to chat with Mr. MacNeil , a cheerful , burly man , in his dressing room . Mr. MacNeil told us that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's dead and he sort of floats around with his chin up , " he said . " I 'm learning how to float , but it 's dangerous , because the stage is dark and there is a very tricky set of steps in the first act . " Mr. MacNeil 's dressing-room door opened , and Nickolaus Lehnhoff , the stage director of " The Flying Dutchman , " hurtled in . " Perfect ! Marvellous ! " said Mr. Lehnhoff . " You will start a new career ! Wotan ! Sachs ! The Dyer ! " We took a diagonal course over to a last-minute rehearsal of the New York City Ballet Company 's " Apollo , " at the New York State Theatre . We arrived just as Peter Martins , on leave from the Royal Danish Ballet a graceful , blond twenty-one-year-old giant with very long legs and a Viking jaw  --  tossed Suzanne Farrell over his left shoulder and returned her to the floor en /ointe . Miss Farrell  --  a tall , pretty ballerina dressed in a purple tank top and baggy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he , in turn , looked inquiringly at the company 's director and choreographer , George Ralanchine , who was standing nearby . " I just want to know if I can take her up with my arm , " said Mr. Martins , crooking an elbow under Miss Farrell 's thigh . " I usually come down out there , " said Miss Farrell , pointing to a spot closer to the footlights . Mr. Balanchine , a spare , dynamic man wearing an open-necked turquoise shirt , moved the dancers downstage and hoisted an imaginary Miss Farrell over his shoulder , working out the new lift in his mind . Then he nodded to Mr. Martins and started the passage again , snapping his fingers to maintain the correct tempo . " Very good , " said Mr. Balanchine when they had finished . " There arc some things we can change , but ni , t tonigh t . Neat ! " On the other side of the plaza , in Philli.t  --  monic Hall , we ran into Richard Rodney Ben nett , a storklike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where the New York Philharmonic was rehearsing the world premi &re; of his Second Symphony , and the Juilliard School of Music , which was presenting his operatic thriller " The Mines of Sulphur . " A versatile composer , Mr. Bennett has also written the music for two current films ( " Billion Dollar Brain " and " Far from the Madding Crowd " ) , a ballet ( " Jazz Calendar , " which has just opened in London ) , and a children 's cantata ( " The Midnight Thief " ) . Mr. Bennett was now listening to a first run-through of his symphony . NVe discovered that he makes a very sharp distinction between the kinds of music he writes . " Tuneful music , as it is generally thought of , is practically , impossible to write now without just writing imitations of earlier tuneful music , " he told us . " On the other hand , I adore to write a big tune for a film , even though , in the back of my mind , I know that I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people collect postage stamps . I counted up the other day and found that I have four hundred and ninety of them stored away in my head . " Mr. Bennett 's symphony  --  an explosive , percussive work , lasting twenty minutes , which the Philharmonic seemed to be learning with considerable difficulty  --  is a serial score in the modern idiom . " I wanted to write a brilliant piece , because this is a brilliant orchestra , " he said . " The symphony is strongly rhythmic and has a kind of cyclical form . I hope it speaks strongly to the audience , but we wo n't know whether the musical ideas come across passionately and directly until the first performance . " At the uptown campus of City College , on St. Nicholas Heights , in the main auditorium , known as the Great Hall , some seven hundred students were sitting in straight-backed Gothic chairs , their bluebooks in front of them , writing their final exams in the History of European Civilization . In some seven hundred heaps on the floor lay coats , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heated by wall radiators concealed under Gothic screens . At Columbia University , in the Punpin Physics Laboratory , a blond young professor named Dr. Sven R. Hartmann , not content with the temperature outside , was setting out  --  in the course of studying the dynamics of a nuclear-spin system  --  to create some of the lowest temperatures ever creaced . His part of the laboratory looked like a machine shop , In one corner stood machine that resembled two cymbals facing each other . The cymbals were large electromagnets , and what seemed to he a long finger poking venturesomely between them was a Dewar , Dr. Hartmann said  --  a kind of thermos bottle . Inside it were liquid helium , which was at 4.2 degrees above absolute zero , and a crystal of calcium fluoride . Absolute zero , or zero degrees Kelvin , is minus 459.67 degrees Fahrenheit . ) By reducing the pressure with a vacuum pump , Dr. Hartmann could get the temperature of the liquid helium down to 1.2 degrees Kelvin . By applying an oscillating magnetic field to the contents of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuclei of the flimride to about .11005 degrees Kelvin . In his office , which was nearby , he had a three-dimensional wire model plotting the course of a super-cooled nuclear-spin system . The wire curved several times around an axis . " I think it 's quite beautiful , " Dr. Hartmann said . His office walls were covered with reproductions of paintings by Paul Klee , There were models of atoms , too , some Consisting of regular rows of bright-red wooden balls on silvery wires . They looked quite a lot like the Klees . Soon afterward , on our way downtown again , we called on Dr. Helmut Adler , who is doing research in animal behavior and has a laboratory adjoining a greenhouse on the roof of the Museum of Natural History . As the hhistery winds seemed about to sweep the flimsy glass house off the roof and send it crashing down into Central Park West , Dr. Adler sat , with his jacket off , fiddling with the wires in a homemade relay circuit . His laboratory was uncomfortably warm , and the wires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of spaghetti . Dr. Adler is a heavy-set man with a black beard . He was conducting an experiment to see whether birds can tell time , and , if so , how accurately . The relay circuit times the giving of food to a bird in a cage and also records the number of pecks the bird makes at a trigger device . The device triggers the food , but the food is available only at certain times during the day  --  at 6 A.M. , 10 A.M. , 2 P.M. , and 6 P.M. His most punctual bird so far , he told us , was a starling named Cynthia , who could tell whether it was two , six , or ten to within fifteen minutes ' accuracy . The ability to tell time by a sort of internal clock is important in bird navigation , Dr. Adler said ; in fact , a fifteen-minute slip could cause a migrating seabird to veer off course suf ficiently to miss a landfall . Cynthia obviously would n't make a very good seabird . Moreover , when she is under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day from night , her internal clock is apt to lose half an hour a clay , or , roughly , a whole day every two months . Cynthia was casting a heady black eye through the steamy glass wall at some pigeons on the Museum roof , and when Dr. Adler reached in to grab her , she shifted her glance to cast a heady black eye at him . " This experiment has put her sense of time out of whack , " he explained apologetically . " She must feel the way I do when I disembark from a jet flight to Europe . " The temperature in the city was eight degrees ( Fahrenheit , not Kelvia ) , and there had been even lower temperatures the week before . At the United States Weather Bureau office in the R.C.A. Building , a young meteorologist , William Lerner , was sitting in front of a radarscope that was connected with an antenna on the roof . The Weather Bureau , which is on the mezzanine just above the ground floor , has almost no view of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was able to report that the weather was clear . " There 's no weather , " he said matter-of-factly . Among meteorologists , " weather " sometimes means precipitation , and on a clear day , accordingly , one can have no weather at all . The radar has a clear view over a radius of two hundred and fifty miles . On the screen , Mr. Lerner picked out the Hudson Valley ; a band across it , which was the George Washington Bridge ; and a blip at the upper end of it , which was a plane flying over Albany . The head forecaster on duty , a stocky terrier of a man named Max Traunfeld , came by to inspect some dials . He predicted higher temperatures . " We should be moderating soon , " he said . Reagan GC ) VERNOR RONALD REAGAN made a quick trip to New York on , day last week to address a banquet of the Economic Club , and late that afternoon we learned that photographers and television cameramen had been invited to photograph the Governor just before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our raincoat pocket and hurried over to the Waldorf . In the Jade Room , on the third floor , a young man who seemed to know what was going on greeted us , offered us some coffee , and told us about the Economic Club while cameras were being set up at the far end of the room . " All the people who belong to this outfit are at least vice-presidents , " hr said . " It 's not the P.-T.A . They have banquets four times a Year , and they 've had some goodies  --  Khrushchev , Prime Minister Wilson . Reagan was invited a year ago . " Wr were early , so we strolled down the hall to the Grand Ballroom . It was a glittering , awesome sight . Waiters in red coats were hustling around among the tables ( red tablecloths ) , dropping ice into glasses . A man in a dark suit was standing on the three-tiered dais and directing the waiters through a public-address system . " Gentlemen ! " he implored , his voice filling the vast room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ice and water in the water glasses before the program goes on ! " Around him , men were piling white roses on the dais , and behind it a huge American flag was stretched across the wall , filling it completely . We sniffed a rose , and it was real ; there were about three thousand roses , we estimated . A man from the florist 's , wearing a black ski jacket , was picking up leaves from the floor . We asked him what kind of leaves they were . " We call ' em green , " he said . We tried to elicit a political opinion from the man , asking him if he favored Reagan for President . " Maybe yes , maybe no , " he said guardedly . " Hey ! " a waiter near us called to another waiter . " Who is it tonight ? " " Ronald Reagan , " came the reply . The first waiter nodded sagely . " No THE NEW YORKER 27 " I 'm awfully sorry , but this is my first merger . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he commented . We quickly turned to him and asked him about Reagan . " I 'll tell you the truth , " he said . " I would n't vote for him . He 's not so hot . He has a nice personality , hut I would n't go for the personality . I do n't like his platform . Let him come out straight . " He clasped his hands behind his back and ran through a critique of the other potential candidates none of them were so hot , he felt  --  and then he branched out into international affairs . " Our State Department do n't say boo , " he was declaring , waving one finger angrily , when we realized that we might be late for the Governor 's arrival in the Jade Room . We excused ourself and hurried down the hall . There were about twenty photographers in the Jade Room by now , and lots of lights , and suddenly Reagan was walking into the room , chatting with another man . Reagan was in a tuxedo . He seemed completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was - Less lined than we 'd expected , and he was a bit taller . A reporter moved in , asked him a question , and said , on receiving a reply , " You 're just being modest , Governor . " " I 've got a lot to he modest about , " replied Reagan , with a twinky smile . Reagan then placed himself at the disposal of the photographers , and they asked him to stand behind a group of microphones and appear to be giving his speech . He did so , and they kept asking him to smile . " If I keep , n1 smiling , it looks like I have 21 very lighthearted speech , " Reagan said , but he smiled some more . " Will you gesture , Governor ? " someone asked . " I do n't gesture very much when I talk , " Reagan said , but he made a few mild gestures anyway . The cameras clicked on and on . " Now , you will gut all these published ? " Reagan said , grinning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech . " Oh dear ! " Reagan said , but he
