Si NIGHTS AT O'REAR 'S a story by Patricia Browning Griffith Crummy , dirty , ugly O'Rear 's ; mecca , umbilicus , polestar of our universe . Who cared about its gritty-edged coffee cups , greasy french fries , gristly chili . O'Rear 's sold setups to anyone old enough to sit upright , and kept the jukebox bawling loud enough to hear from the highway as you drove by . There , boisterous , smug , indifferent , suffering , we gathered around the small white building like an automotive crap game , conducting our social lives within the confines of our Detroit armor  --  though a lot of them bore a sign in the back window . " Made in Texas by Texans . " O'Rear 's Round-Up Drive-in was a square box like the drive-in in every town in the country , fiat-topped and glass-fronted , tacked with pictures of faded sandwiches and voluptuous ice-cream sodas that never quite came true , with a luminous multicolored jukebox , its windowed head working continuously conveying , impaling , spinning discs which exploded into Ruth Brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lefty Frizzell . O'Rear 's was not even so ambitious an undertaking as to entice us with noon , but relied instead on a wooden sign with the red " 0 " in " O'Rear 's " painted to resemble a lasso . But then it did n't need neon to attract us . There was little to do in that town ; the movie was about all . The skating rink closed for the hot months , the rodeo lasted only a week , the Saturday night drag races had been closed by the sheriff , and the Baptists would n't allow dancing  --  so we drove . We drove and drove and drove for hours always within a radius of fifteen miles , up one of the two main streets , down the other , dragging from the city limit sign to the cemetery road , turn here , then there , like a child 's pony ride , the same circle , the same path , day after day , night after night , sweating and sticking against the plastic seat covers , strewing the roads with beer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popping our mufflers , a primitive mating rite with horsepower trappings . Religiously we stopped at O'Rear 's , where cars swarmed on Friday , Saturday , and Sunday nights as if it were a Billy Graham crusade . Finally if we had a date we 'd park on lovers ' lane , a road between the railroad tracks and the cemetery . If we did n't have a date we 'd circle the main street again , drive down lovers ' lane to see who was there , and go home , hopes building toward the next night . In that town people actually stayed in cars so much it was possible to know a person all summer without ever having seen him from the chest down . Men cared for their cars as women cared for their children . They were discussed , cleaned , decorated , and primed ; they were readily identifiable . Chrome was very big . Also it was important that the back of the car be weighted so that it was lower than the front . We looked like a whole town of bootleggers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radio speakers were absolutely necessary . It was essential to drive fast with the window down and your arm resting on the door but - still provide music for the people in the back seat since everyone , every night listened to Randy 's Record Shop in Gallatin , Tennessee . As cars pulled up to O'Rear 's chances were twenty to one the program turned off in each car would be Randy 's with someone like Chuck Berry " Maybelline " - ing it along . Our leading , swashbuckling driver was Max Corley , whose ' 51 Fordomatic traveled with outside sun visor , spotlight , twin side-view mirrors , fender skirts , continental tire rack , ripple bar wheel-discs , imitation leopard-skin seat covers , a backseat speaker on each side , a nude-decorated steering nob , and a beer opener chained to the back of the ashtray . Max Corley foraged the countryside in his green chromey car , a Western Genghis Khan in ducktail and a Stetson , backed by Bobby - Tack Owens and the Riley boys , Floyd and Warren , who were probably as unsavory to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Max had actually enjoyed a brief popularity among the average Christian-type children in grade school but by high school most people tried to stay out of his way , knowing it was Harry-hang-the-flag for any kid who crossed him . We simply called him a bully , accepting that as the exhaustive truth , for that was how we saw things  --  unvarnished but oversimplified with everyone explained by our one-word character labels  --  friendly , ugly , stuck-up , sweet , cute , pious , and so on . There was no doubt , however . that Max Corley possessed a certain dark , solemn charm which could be summoned forth for his purposes , so that any nice-looking new girl was liable to find herself in the back seat of his green and chrome car before anyone else got her name straight . A lot of women found his glum , sideburns type attractive . In fact it was remarked on several occasions that the service he received at O'Rear 's was exceptionally good . laRear 's had two carhops  --  Mildred Temple , a tall , flat-faced girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a good professional carhop . Short , stocky , blondined , sturdy as a tractor , she strode from car to car , balancing trays as if her hands were a foot square , waiting on four cars in the time it took Mildred to handle one . She had a sharp , crude tongue and the ability to create that happy rapport that sometimes exists between men and waitresses . Mildred , on the other hand , was slow at writing her orders , slow at delivering them , and between cars she 'd rest on the Dell Dairy Ice Cream bench beside the screen door fanning herself with her red cowboy hat which , with black slacks and whiteblouses , made up the uniform of the O'Rear 's waitresses . Early in the afternoon when business was slack , Mildred would sit on the bench writing letters on her stationery box , gazing across the highway now and then where two orange gas pumps and an oak tree in the pasture beside them looked like mere toys below the immense steel-gray backdrop of Texas sky . " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she 'd begin the letters and fill pink page after pink page with her small handwriting . She wrote always with a snapshot before her , taken from her billfold , fat with pictures of elderly relatives singly or in groups , standing on the porch of a farmhouse , in front of a barn , or beside a car . But the recipients of the long pink letters were two gaunt-faced servicemen posed in twenty-five-cent photo booths . One picture was inscribed in the corner ? " Love ya , Freddy . " They were both fiances , she 'd explained . Around her neck she wore a large white enamel locket with a rose on it , which contained other pictures of the fiances . Freddy had been cut from a group snapshot and was so tiny about all you could see was the outline of a face under a soldier 's cap worn low on the forehead . The other fiance was a large , disembodied face with the chin cropped off . She could n't decide which one to marry , but she worried more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Europe . Despite the fiances , on Saturdays Mildred would be in the early movie sitting on the back row with strange boys who wore T-shirts with a pocket on the chest and worked on road construction crews . They were always just passing through town , and hung out in the Post Office Cafe , where Mildred met them . In deference to her fiances , however , she would claim they were cousins or just friends or went to her church . A couple of years before O'Rear 's opened Mildred had made a brief excursion into high school . It was hard to understand why she came to school in the first place since she spent every period reading confession magazines hidden inside her notebook . As far as anyone noticed , the only time she paid attention was the day the males and females were separated and shown a film on venereal diseases , and the day we read " 0 my hive is like a red , red rose , " and Max Corley caught her copying it into a letter . Patricia Browning Griffith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now married and living in Washington . This is her second published story , and she is finishing a novel called " The Future Is Nut What It Used to Be . " a story by Patricia Browning Griffith 83 The population of our school was divided into cliques of town girls and cliques of country girls while the boys mingled democratically . But Mildred belonged to another group , a few really poor girls who sometimes wore dirty clothes and needed baths and had hair-pulling fights after school . These girls spent lots of time in the rest room putting on makeup and sneaking puffs off cigarettes and were blamed for the four-letter words scrawled on the rest room walls in lipstick and pencil which the rest of us read so avidly . After three or four months Mildred dropped out of school and until O'Rear 's opened we 'd only see her now and then on Saturdays snuggled on the back row of the movie . She had always been a pleasant girl , with a big gummy smile , and Max Corley and his friends had always teased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O'Rear 's . " Who you writin ' , Mildred ? " Max called as she sat on the bench one afternoon . She closed her stationery box quickly , revealing the word " love " drawn over and over again on the top of it and decorated with flowers at the top of the " 1 " and the end of the " e . " " I bet she 's writin ' her boyfriend in California , " Bobby Jack said from his seat beside Max . Mildred approached the car self-consciously as if her size had come upon her only the night before . Bobby Jack was tall and skinny with two yellowed teeth , which we attributed to his having drunk West Texas water for the first eleven years of his life . " That perfumed paper you writin ' on , Mildred ? " he asked . Mildred pulled her order pad out of her side pocket . " No it ai n't , " she said gruffly . " Who you writin ' , Mildred ? " Max demanded . Mildred lifted her well-plucked eyebrows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her hand as she did . Her nails were large but short and painted purple-red . " My fi-an-ce , " She said the words importantly . " Your fi-an-ce ! " they mocked . Bobby Jack lounged with his arm resting across the back of the imitation leopard-skin seats . " Who you in love with today , Mildred ? The one with the big nose or the one with the pimple face ? " he asked . Floyd and Warren in the back seat laughed , slapping the knees of their Levis with their freckled hands . Mildred ignored them and pulled out her white dime-store sunglasses . She had used the same purple-red nail polish to paint red stripes around the white rims . " How do you know when you 're in love , Mildred ? " Max asked her thoughtfully . He seemed to be staring at her thin lips where lipstick had caked like tiny red scabs along the edges . " Does your heart pound when you 're in love ? " Bobby Jack took up the game . " Do your knees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have hot and cold flashes ? " Floyd Riley asked . Mildred wiped the lenses with the tail of her white blouse and held them against the sun for inspection . Bobby Jack leaned toward her and spoke with conviction . " I 'll bet it 's just an itch where you ca n't scratch , " he said . Mildred adjusted the sunglasses and tried to fluff her short permanented hair back over her ears while they laughed . " Did n't I see you parked down on lovers ' lane , Mildred ? " they 'd ask . Or , " Who was that you were smooching in the movie Saturday , Mildred ? " " Do you really believe in LOVE , Mildred ? " Now and then she 'd smile broadly at their ridiculous questions as she 's smiling in our class picture taken early in the year while she was there . She stands the tallest of all the girls , her black patent shoulder-strap purse hung around her neck and encircling one arm like part of a soldier 's gear , a kooky look in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of us look shockingly young and deceptively innocent and it 's a great surprise since my mind 's eye remembers us as simply shorter adults , like the pictures in Beavtiful Stories from Shakespeare . 84 NIGHTS AT O'REAR 'S The spring Mildred began working at O'Rear 's Sonny Morris , owner of the Grand movie theater , opened a radio station outside of town . It was the type of station that broadcast the local Baptist minister on Sunday mornings and filled every afternoon with a musical request program . We have a card here front Shirley W. says , - Please play ' I 'd Walk a Mile ' for Jimmy and Diane , Ronnie and Sue , Larry and Wilma Jean , and that good looking Sophomore M. L. " Also a card from . Saturday morning was the local talent show featuring church ladies ' trios and men 's quartets , and infantile voices interspersed with the dull , heavy shuffling of tap shoes . Sonny Morris scouted all the rural communities in the area to fill up those three Saturday morning hours . There were four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at church socials when people were desperate for entertainment or wanted the main attraction to seem better than it was . So one Saturday morning we drove to the station set in what had recently been a calf lot , and straining toward the microphone sang " Moonlight Bay " with echoing parts . Sonny Morris read off a commercial for a local hardware store and then introduced the Lord 's Lights trio from the Pine Grove Baptist Mission . Sonny Morris liked his better groups to have names , so the Lord 's Lights had been created right there in front of the Dr. Pepper machine . They sang - In the Garden " and " Were You There ? " in close harmony . Mildred was a Lord 's Light . She and another brunette slumped stiffly on either side of a short , fat red-haired soprano who bobbed her head as she sang . After a cornet solo Mildred came back to the microphone . We expected another hymn and you could n't tell by the introduction since the pianist began all the songs with the last four bars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Papa " sounded like a hymn . She stood with her fists doubled at her sides staring at the clock in the back of the room . She was dressed up for the Saturday movie in a limp green sweater and a black skirt , a gold ankle bracelet , and a string of brown wooden beads . In her attempt at theatrical makeup , round patches of rouge sat on either cheek and black lines winged from either side of her eyes . She took a deep breath and closed her eyes . " It was beside the Pontchartrain beside the Pontchartrain. " she began to sing . The first notes nearly knocked us out of our folding chairs . We 'd never heard anyone sing so loudly . Her voice was so strong and intense with a husky quality , it stunned us . She gripped each note with her nasal alto , wringing it dry before she slid to the next . Now and then her body would sway and her eyesclose again as she made a long note a sort of country tremolo . The song was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rhymed in hillbilly unsubtlety , of love , betrayal , and death on the shores of that gloomy lake , The Mildred before us , looking like a pimple-faced Olive Oyl , seemed to drift away and reappear in a world of Spanish moss , veiled by the misty fog of the lake , suffering over love as we had only dreamed it could be suffered . All our backseat automobile romancing shrank to dull insignificance . We drank in each strange , loud note , even though slightly embarrassed to see in Mildred an experience of love we had only dreamed of . That evening she became the star . " Can I have your autograph ? " Bobby Jack said as she set eight bundled hamburgers on their tray . " Heard you knocked ' cm dead today , Mildred , " Max said . " Heard they had to call the sheriff to calm the fans . " Mildred smiled trying to hide her pleasure by fishing in her side pocket for money . " I 'm gon na sing next week , too , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her slide their change across the metal tray , counting aloud as she did . " I believe Mildred 'll be a star ! " " A star ! " Bobby Jack shrieked . He shouted into the back seat as if Floyd and Warren had n't heard . " Mildred 's gon na be a star ! " He hopped out of the car , bounded to another , and shouted , " Mildred 's gon na be a star ! " That week everyone teased Mildred about being a star . It was the chic . thing to do . That 's the way an idea was , very clever for about a week and then suddenly one night , as if by magic decree , it was n't and only real clods trying too hard would say it again . It was hot that week . The temperature passed a hundred every day . Housewives , husbands , old people in cars with " See You in Church Sunday " stickers drove to O'Rear 's and sat fanning themselves and wishing for a breeze . Mildred and Dorothy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their hair in back and tied on top of their heads . Mildred 's hair was shorter than the net so the snood drooped down in back like a damp fish net . Every night Max and his friends discussed Mildred 's career with her . " You do your do-re-mi 's today , Mildred ? " Max would ask . " I been thinkin ' you ought a get a lot of sexy costumes , " Bobby Jack said one night and they all broke up with laughter . Mildred would blush and smile at Max , flattered 86 NIGHTS AT O'REAR 'S by his attention and never certain whether it was total teasing or not . " You better be thinkin ' about takin ' your fiances along with you when you hit the big time , " Bobby Jack advised her one night . He reared back pulling change for the jukebox from the front pocket of his tight Levis . Mildred picked up her big white locket which left a greenish " V " on her neck and ran it back and forth absent-mindedly on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure those fiances have class , " he said . Mildred rarely paid attention to Bobby Jack 's comments , but she listened to Max . " You got ta take care of yourself , Mildred , " Max said . " You ought a have a scarf around your throat . " It was scathingly hot but he insisted Bobby Jack wrap a handkerchief around her neck . For the rest of the evening they called her Tonto . On Friday night before her performance Max told her to give it everything she had . " You never know who might be listening , " he said soberly . " That 's right , Mildred . Roy Acuff might be listening in person , " Bobby Jack said . " Ernest Tubb might be listening , " Floyd said . " Minnie Pearl might be listening , " Bobby Jack added and they began laughing . Max had taken Warren Riley 's rabbit 's foot away from him and given it to Mildred for good luck . " It 's been in my family since the days of Davy Crockett @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have it . " Everybody at O'Rear 's had taken up the game and was wishing her good luck and saying how Hollywood or the Grand Ole Opry would be the next stop . Mildred would smile gratefully . " Do n't forget to suck a lemon in the morning soon as you get up , " Bobby Jack called before they roared away . The next morning Sonny Morris saved Mildred 's song till near the end of the program and presented her as returning due to popular demand . There was the sound of a chair scraping then a few seconds later Mildred at the microphone . " I 'd like to dedicate this song to all my good friends at O'Rear 's and especially to Max Corley for encouraging my career , " she said . Then she launched into " Are Ya half as Good a Girl , As Your Mother Thinks You Are " while all over town people were gasping and thumping their radios in disbelief . It was the most exciting thing to happen in weeks . Max would be furious , outraged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poor Mildred , we said to one another and giggled . The movie was always jammed on Saturday nights and especially that Saturday since it wasthe coolest place in town . But as soon as the last feature was over there was a race to O'Rear 's to see what Max was going to do . " You sang real good , " people called to Mildred when they drove up and in the next breath they 'd ask if Max had been there yet . She 'd shake her head disgustedly . She 'd been teased about the dedication all afternoon though she insisted that she meant nothing by dedicating that song to Max . They were just friends , she said , and she wished people would n't always be making things outa nothing . Earlier Max had been zooming around town like a tornado before he crossed the river to Oklahoma and Johnny 's Roadside " 21 " Club and Restaurant . Johnny 's specialized in fried catfish and hot hush puppies and featured on Saturday night a hillbilly band with the kind of dancing that was accompanied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was nearly midnight before Max came roaring up with the Riley boys . his twin Hollywood tail pipes thundering behind , and Bobby Jack tailing him in his father 's blue pickup . They circled a couple of times , long enough to stir up a cloud of dust that floated into everyone 's root beers and then screeched to a halt with a spray of gravel . They were all wearing Western hats and smoking cigars and passing around a bottle of whiskey wrapped in a paper sack . Bobby Jack left his pickup and lumbered over to lean on the door of Max 's car next to Warren . From the jukebox Ray Charles was shouting , " Hallelujah I just lave her so " Bobby Jack ducked his head between his arms to kick a rock under the car and swayed his bottom to the music . Mildred was across the drive-in , her pencil poised above her order pad when Max drove up . " Here he conies , " someone called to her . She dropped her order pad and bumped her head on a side-view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for service Mildred was on her way to another car . She walked on as if expecting Dorothy to wait on Max . Then Floyd Riley stuck his head out the back window and yelled , " Soucy ! " Mildred stopped . " Sooey , " Floyd bellowed again . She pushed back her bangs that were sticking to her shiny forehead . Then walking unevenly over the gravel as if her feet hurt , carrying a tray half full of paper cups and bottles , she went to Max 's car . " Hi , Max , " she said shyly trying to push a stray lock of hair under the snood . Max stuck a cigar in the side of his mouth and tilted his head back to stare at her from under his Western hat . In the heat her thick black mascara had drooped from the top of her eyelashes and formed a black crescent under each eye . " We wrote a song for you , Mildred , you wan na hear it ? " Warren asked . He , Floyd , and Bobby Jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... Her eyes are red , her teeth are yellow ... , her head is like a watermelon ? ? " At that point laughter broke up the singing . " There 's more , " Floyd said but started laughing again . Max motioned to Mildred with a crook of his finger as if he had a secret to tell . When she took a hesitant step nearer the car Max reached out the window and with one hand shoved the tray , scattering bottles and cups to the ground . Mildred jumped back pulling at her wet blouse where icy root beer had spilled . She looked up at Max as if expecting some reasonable explanation , but he 'd turned his back to her and was lighting the cigar . She picked up the bottles , her face scarlet , then hobbled back to the front counter , shoved the tray inside , and hurried to the side of the building where she entered the door marked with a crudely drawn sign " Cowgirls . " After a word from Max , Bobby Jack jumped into his truck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tinny wallop of a pickup door . Max revved his engine and they pulled up to either side of the door Mildred had entered . They left no more than a car 's length between them and the building . " I f you 've got the money , honey , I 've got the ti-i-i-me . . " Lefty Frizzell sang through the hot night as they waited . When Mildred opened the door Warren was ready with the spotlight . It flashed against the coarse white-painted concrete blocks of the building and circled a moment before he caught her squarely in the center of light . She held up one hand to shield her eyes , holding the other arm to her side as if she were trying to retract within herself like one of those cheap Japanese fans . She had tried to rinse the root beer from her white blouse , which now hung damply outside her black slacks . The stray hair was tucked back inside the snood and the mascara scrubbed from below her eyes . After a moment she started toward the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Quickly Max pulled forward , his front wheels on the sidewalk , his front bumper touching the building , blocking her path . She was no more than six feet from the car and in the spotlight she looked surprised as if she 'd not realized what they intended . On the other side of O'Rear 's a few people left their ears and wandered over to watch , leaning against other cars and chatting with the people inside . " Run through the middle , Mildred , " someone shouted . She stood still a minute then cautiously as though measuring her possibilities began walking between the cars . Slowly , alongside her Max and Bobby Jack backed until they formed a " V " in front of her . " Come on , Mildred , " a voice called , " leap over the car , " and there was laughter . Max still had the cigar clamped in the side of his mouth and he 'd pulled his Western hat low on his forehead so that his eyes were nearly hidden . He was steering the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . Mildred walked hack to the sidewalk and bit her lip . She looked as if she might burst into tears but she put her hands on her hips and tried to look tough . " Okay , Max , " she said nodding her flat face at him and trying to sound threatening . She turned abruptly and started limping vigorously toward the back of the building . Since the curb was higher toward the back of the building Bobby Jack had to back once and pick up speed to climb the curb then slam on his brakes to keep from hitting the building . This time the pickup was no more than a yard from her . " You 're slow as Christmas , Mildred , " Bobby Jack said to her leaning both arms out the window and shaking his head . Mildred turned back toward the front . Dorothy carrying three stacked trays came around the building and stopped to appraise the situation . " You on vacation , Mildred ? " she called . She looked from Bobby Jack to Max . " Why do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Max , " she said . Floyd gave her the finger and she stomped away . Mildred removed a tissue from her pocket and stuffed it in the heel of her right shoe . She pushed her foot down a couple of times , testing it for comfort then leaned against the side of the building and folded her arms as if prepared to wait it out . About that time , bald Mr. O'Rear with a white cloth tucked into his pants for an apron leaned around the corner and said that if Max did n't cut out that spotlight and foolishness he was gon na call the sheriff . They were interfering with his business . Furthermore if Mildred did n't get back to work she could in the future collect her check from another establishment . Max backed so that Warren could switch the spotlight to Mr. O'Rear as he spoke and everybody laughed until Mr. O'Rear retreated inside , muttering to himself . Mildred looked helplessly toward Mr. O'Rear as he spoke . She seemed about to call out to him when she saw Max had taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She stood very still weighing her chance to escape against the danger of angering Max further . Then she put one hand against the building as if to bolster herself . Slowly she began edging along the sidewalk in front of Max , tiptoeing . her eyes focused on his head . " Max ! " Bobby Jack shouted from behind her . Max seemed instantaneously aware of his negligence , He stomped on the gas before turning to see her half across in front of him . She pressed herself against the wall as if she were facing a knife thrower . The green car moved steadily toward her . " Run , Mildred , " someone yelled impatiently , for Max looked far enough away for her to get by , but she seemed unable to move . Max 's mood of confidence seemed to change . He gripped the wheel and leaned forward as if he might will her to move . Only her hand jerked up to clutch her locket . When he hit the sidewalk and did n't stop , her mouth opened in a silent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Max hit the brakes but it was all too late . She screamed a long , low chilling scream , the car slammed her against the side of the building . The bumper hit her below the knees and she seemed to fold up , and only then did the scream stop . For a moment it was quiet enough to hear a car passing on the highway and far off a dog barking hoarsely . The spotlight shone on a Big Daddy Burger sign on the side window . " Jesus Christ ! " Dorothy cried out from beside a nearby car . Then the jukebox which had been between records blared and people moved . Mr. O'Rear stalked out , cursed at Max , and hurried back inside to phone for the sheriff and the ambulance from the funeral home . For a minute Max sat stunned , bent over the steering wheel . Finally he removed his hat and smoothed his ducktails and with his arm wiped the sweat from his forehead . Warren rubbed his head where he 'd hit the windshield . " I found my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' genial voice was singing . Before the record ended , the ambulance could be heard over the jukebox . There was considerable discussion as to who would ride with her the thirty miles to the hospital . When they put her on the stretcher she cried out , her voice , deep and loud , her mouth an open rectangle , " Ah-ah-ah " The next week there was a new carhop , a bosomy girl with a harelip called Sissy .

We never again saw Mildred Temple around town or in the movie or at O'Rear 's .
