txt Mesquite , Tex , , June 9 Speciall  --  Two men today faced charges on which they could get eight years in prison for the vicious rope lashing of four boys who entered the barn of one of the men to feed a litter of kittens . Frank Borchardt , 55 , owner of the barn , also was charged with shooting to death two pedigreed dogs the boys had with them . For that be could receive a prison term of 2 to 20 years for each dog . The flogged boys , beaten until raw and bleeding on many parts of their bodies , are two sets of brothers , Richard and Lewis Singleton , 9 and 10 years old , and William and Daniel Allen , 8 and 13 . Beaten on Broken Arm The older Allen boy bad his right arm in a cast , having broken it in a fall at school several weeks ago , and was beaten , on the fractured limb . " I 've seen some beatings in my day but this  --  was the toughest one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys had welts over their entire bodies , some of them raw . " A strange sidelight of the case was the burning last night of a building on Borchardt 's farm a few hours after the boys ' beating and while Borchardt and his co-defendant , Vernon Crane , 46 , a pressman at the the Dallas Morning News , were spending the night in jail . Charges of arson were placed against Crane 's wife , Sally , 44 ; her sister , Mrs. Dorothy Josch , 46 , and their friend , Jess Dome , 77 , Mesquite dog catcher , who drove them to the scene . The arson , however , apparently had nothing to do with the boys ' whipping . The Sheriff 's Version Sheriff Bill Decker , who filed . charges of aggravated assault against the two men for the boys ' beating charged Borchardt with wilful destruction of property for shooting the dogs , pieced the case together as follows : All of the principals live on farms'in and near Mesquite , a town six miles east of Dallas that extended its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Singleton brother s are neighbors , living several rn4e , s from the farm which Borchardt rents and uses as a headquarters for his cattle trading business . Crane is a friend of Borchardt and lives near him . Borchardt complained that 27 of his chickens had been killed , apparently by dogs , in the last week or two and believed the boys and their dogs were responsible . He said he had yelled at them and had tried to catch them several times but had been unsuccessful . Find Litter of Kittens The boys , with four young Beagles belonging to the Aln family , hunted thru the area , scaring up rabbits . But they said they kept their dogs on leash and never had been on the Borchardt farm until Wednesday . On that day they wandered into the Borchardt barn and found a litter of kittens . Yesterday they returned and brought the kittens milk . They said they were eager to see if the kittens had opened their eyes . They tied their four registered pups outside so they would n't frighten the kittens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to work and stopped when he saw the boys there . Then Borchardt came out to the barn , picked up a halter rope and went into the loft where the boys were . Goes After a Gun Crane , who insisted he took no part in the beatings , said he heard Borchardt shout : " What in hell are you doing up there ? " then heard him hitting something with a rope . At Borchardt 's order , Crane said , he went into the farmhouse and got a .22 caliber rifle with which Borchardt shot two of the dogs . Borchardt was quoted as admitting he swung the rope at the boys , asserting : " They were on my property . " He said he shot the dogs because he believed they had killed his chickens . Crane was freed on $1,000 bond , Borchardt on $5,000 . The arson charge against Crane 's wife and sister in law and Doane followed the burning of a three room cottage on the farm . It was not Borchardt 's house . Mrs. Crane would say only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble . " Police said there were reports she believed parties including women were held in the building . Borchardt said it was used for poker parties but only for men .
