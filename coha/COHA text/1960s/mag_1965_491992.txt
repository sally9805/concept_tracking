VE GOT NOTHING TO HIDE ' ne starlit evening nut long ago , in a to-bacco patch near the little town of ilem-ingway , S.C. , IN rithed and hooded men and women gathered in a circle around a 50-foot black gum cross that had been wrapped in burlap and snaked in crankcase oil . Solemnly they set the towering shaft ablaze and marched around it singing , as a record player hitched up to a loudspeaker boomed into the dark-ness the opening strains of ' The Old Rugged Cross . ' Suddenly the needle stuck . : Hid over the clark woods surrounding t he lit tie field , the speaker repealed over and over the phrase that ends the tirsi line of the song : " ... and shame " ? . , and shine " ? " and shame . " If the Klansmen who set the cross aflame felt any shame at this use of the symbol of Christian brotherhood to publicize an organization which thrives on racial hatred , they gave no sign of it . There was nothing clandestine about the meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Masonic Hall in Hemingway , ladies of the Klan sold barbecue. slaw , cake and soda pup , and passed out literature extolling the noble purposes of the order . At the rally itself , on a flatbed truck decorated with Confederate and American nags. the assembled Dragons , Titans and Exalted Cyclopses of the two Carolinas sat proudly in their emerald , white and crimson robes , waiting for " His Lordship . " one Robert Shelton of Tuscaloosa , Alabama , imperial Wizard of the United Klans of America , Knights of the Ku Klux Klan , Inc .. to bring them the true and lively word , None wore a mask . " We want you to see our faces , " bellowed Robert Scoggins. the Grand Dragon of South Carolina . to the crowd of some 800 men , women and barefoot children who stood before the speakers ' platform in the glare of the burning cross . We want you to know who we are and what we are doing . We got nothing to hide . " As Scoggins finished his brief welcome , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gray-green uniform , and black paratrooper boots with white laces , swaggered back and forth across the platform , staring stonily at the crowd . He and a tall , slack-jawed companion with captain 's bars on his shoulders were the " Security Guard . " They were there to silence hecklers . A German reporter from West Berlin looked curiously at these glowering storm troopers . " I have seen such men before , " he said . The strutting guards , the unmasked Klansmen , the public rally  --  all were evidence of the Klan 's bold resurgence both in numbers and in spirit . The revival was furtive at first . In 1954 , when the Supreme Court handed down its school decision , the fragments of the old Klan of the 1940 's began quietly to regroup . In the upper rooms of old buildings on the side streets of the bigger towns , in cheap motels and highway restaurants , in abandoned barns and farmhouses deep in the woods , the " sacred altars " were set up . On them were placed the American flag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12th chapter of Romans  --  St. Paul 's eloquent exhortation to Godly conduct . In the glow of an electrically lighted cross , red-necked " Aliens " knelt to mumble the old Klan oath , swearing to " dedicate heart , mind and body to the preservation of Christian civilization , " and to carry with them to their graves the secrets of the order . Sometimes identifying their groups as hunting-and-fishing clubs or county-improvement associations , the Klansmen collected arms and manufactured their own ammunition . Under the tutelage of ex-G.I. ' s , they practiced judo and karate and crawled through swamps on " maneuvers , " getting ready for the inevitable day when the Jews and the Communists would give the signal and the Negroes would rise to destroy the white race in the South . Passage of the Civil Rights Bill in June of 1964 brought the Klan boldly into the open . All over the South crosses blazed at public rallies . Fierce-eyed preachers , most of them self-ordained , began to shout in public the twisted doctrine they had proclaimed in the secrecy of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Pope of Rome was anti-Christ , that the Negro was a beast who must be destroyed . " Oh , God , " prayed one , " please put grace and grit into the white race and let us wipe out this black-ape race before it is too late . " The ignorant and frightened men and women who join the Klan claim to be uplifted by this savage doctrine . To them the Klan is a religion , a holy crusade . In North Carolina , a robed Klansman told reporters : " I feel nearer to God at a rally than at any other time . When I put on this robe it 's a grand feeling . It 's white  --  as pure as Jesus Christ . The cross burning is not to make people stand in fear . The cross is what Christ died on . " " It 's better than going to church ? ' a woman member said . Al Hemingway . after a robed Klan chaplain known as " The Kludd " had prayed long and fervently for the Lord to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to speak . He is a tall , slender . hollow-cheeked man with dark , lifeless eyes , and even in his robes of royal purple topped by a gilded cape and hood , he looked withdrawn and wary ? " like a man who thinks he is about to be shot at , " an Alabama newspaperman said . His voice was toneless , his theme was the same old Klan refrain . Every patriotic white , Anglo-Saxon Protestant must be ready to give his life if need be to save the purity of his race . But there must be no violence . All must be accomplished by peaceful means  --  by the boycott and the ballot . Occasionally from the crowd came a deep " Amen " and a scattering of applause . Shelton told a joke . " You know how they finly found them three boys that was buried in that dam near Philadelphia , Mississippi ? " he asked . " The Federal Bureau of Integration did n't find them boys . The mailman found them . He walked by there delivering welfare checks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The crowd roared with laughter and delight . Shelton droned on . paying his disrespects to the Supreme Court , to the traitors who would modify the immigration laws , to " Light Bulb " Johnson and " Bobby Sox " Kennedy and " Martin Luther Coon . " He finished , took of his robes , folded them neatly and put them in the back of his car . Then , dressed in a gray suit and dark red tie , he moved about among the crowd , chatting and shaking hands while the loudspeaker played When They Ring Those Golden Bells . Shelton 's mood was somber . The presence of so many reporters and cameramen apparently had inhibited him , causing him to tone down his speech . The usual taking of a collection had been omitted , presumably because the sight of the plastic buckets tilled with dollar bills coming back up to the platform might give the wrong impression . He seemed to be trying to appeal to a wider audience than the fewer than 1.000 who had come out to hear him . To reporters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organization of patriots . He had brought with him from Tuscaloosa the ancient epic of the silent-movie days , D. W. Griffith 's The Birth of a Nation . He had n't felt it wise to show it , though he finds it his most effective recruiting device , for it extols the glories of the Klan of Reconstruction days , and has for its dramatic climax the Klan 's pursuit and punishment of a Negro rapist and murderer . " I killed niggers all night in my sleep after I saw that thing , " said a Klansman who had seen the film previously . By moonrise the flaming cross was sputtering out . The loudspeaker was softly droning Abide With Me . Shelton , his brow furrowed , climbed into has white Pontiac Grand Prix and set out on the long drive to Bastrop . La. , and another Klan rally . Earlier , on the 600-mile drive to South Carolina from his headquarters in Tuscaloosa . Shelton had talked at length with a Post reporter . Weighing his words , he had painted a picture of . who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have active Klaverns in 39 states . Federal agents , who keep a close eye on Shelton and have planted informers in most of his Klaverns , know that Shelton is exaggerating the United Klans ' strength when he speaks of " many thousands " of members . Reliable estimates place the present active membership at under 5,000 , concentrated mainly in Georgia , Alabama , the Carolinas , Tennessee and Louisiana . Even this small membership , however , enables the United Klans to throw its weight around politically , particularly in rural counties , with a power that far exceeds its strength in numbers . A law-enforcement officer , assigned to keep constant watch on the Klan , explains : " Suppose you have a race for sheriff or county commissioner in some country county where the civil-rights issue is hot . Klansmen will ride in from all over the South to burn a cross and hold a rally . Then they 'll sneak around and put up a lot of little stickers ? ' The Ku Klux Klan is watching you . ' The candidates get scared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to outdo each other in proving what true-blue Americans they are and how strong they are against the Negro . The fear of the Klan colors the whole election campaign , when the truth is the Klan could n't deliver a hundred votes in the whole county . " Shelton favors this kind of political leverage . " Our weapon is the ballot and the boycott , " he says . " You let a man who runs a little store know how you feel about a candidate , he pretty soon gets the idea he better see it the same way or he 'll lose a lot of trade . Our women members do a lot of the political work focus . They baby-sit for folks who want to go to the courthouse to register , and they drive people to the polls on election day , and during a campaign they may go from house to house , passing out literature and talking for the candidates the Klan likes . We work down in the grass roots , and in a lot of counties we can elect just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say outright who we want elected , but the word gets around . " In areas where the Klan feels its strength , a Klan leader may campaign openly for a candidate , or the Klan may put up one of its own members . In Atlanta , for example , Calvin Craig , the United Kiang ' Grand Dragon for Georgia , ran for the state senate and loudly pledged his support to the Goldwater-Miller candidacy  --  a startling departure from the Klan 's traditional antagonism toward Jews and Catholics . Craig lost his senate race in Atlanta , but the smaller cities and the rural counties , where many share the Klan 's defiant attitude toward the Civil Rights Act and school desegregation , gave Goldwater a 94,000 majority and put Georgia in the Republican column for the first time in its history . Far more dangerous than the Klan 's power to influence politics by persuasion is its power to intimidate whole communities through acts of terrorism . Federal agents use harsh language when they read Shelton 's pious utterances about his aversion to lawlessness . Federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from telephoned threats to arson , bombings , beatings and murder  --  often follows the forma-r Lion of a strong Klavern . In early July , 1961 , at a meeting in Georgia , Shelton was elected Imperial Wizard of the United Klans , and some independent Georgia Klans which had been relatively inactive became part of that organization . Within a month , according to the files of both the Atlanta police and the Georgia attorney general 's office , fired-up Klans were training members in the use of explosives . An es-Navy frogman was the instructor , and a " training camp " was set up in rural Clayton County near Atlanta . Before Shelton went into Mississippi early last spring to organize Klaverns there . Klan activity had been largely confined to those counties where an independent organization called the White Knights of the K.K.K. was forming  --  a group known to federal agents as the . most furtive , vicious , and close-mouthed . of the Klans . Although it operated in other areas of the state , its activities were concentrated in southwest Mississippi and along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approval . " What you are up against there is a conspiracy of silence on the part of a whole people , " one federal investigator said . " Crimes are committed that are never reported in the press , never investigated by the local law . The victims , if they survive , are afraid to file a complaint . In the event an arrest is made and a man is brought to trial , getting a conviction is almost impossible . But what else can you expect in a state where a judge , in the presence of several other men , told a sheriff : ' If you get into a drove of niggers and have to kill one of them , you might as well goon and kill them all . A dead nigger ca n't talk . ' " In this atmosphere of defiance Shelton easily formed Klaverns in the Natchez nd McComb areas . A rash of bombings of homes , churches , and places of business broke out in Mississippi in the summer of 1964 as college students and other civil-rights volunteers came into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Among the houses bombed was that of Natchez Mayor John Nosser , who had offended Klansmen by promising Negroes equal protection under the law and the right to vote if qualified . As the frequency of the bombings increased , other political leaders were stirred to belated action . After the bombing of the Lexington newspaper office of Hazel Brannon Smith , Pulitzer prize winner and critic of the Klan , Mayor Allen C. Thompson f Jackson became the first Mississippi official to speak out against Klan violence . Though he did not denounce the Klan by name , he came out strongly against terrorism . " Do not ever deceive yourself into thinking that these bombers , who do their cowardly work at night , will stop with your neighbor , " he said . " Tomorrow it will be your home , your business , or even your family . " He offered rewards and pledged police action . Two ays later , Mississippi 's segregationist governor , Paul B. Johnson Jr .. announced that he was building up a force of state police to combat the growing violence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the cooperation of the FBI , had three men under arrest , charged with the bombing of two homes in McComb . One of them , a 25-year-old railway carman named Paul Dewey Wilson , was caught as he was hauling a small arsenal from his home to a remote farmhouse . In his possession were four high-powered rifles , a pistol , eight wooden clubs , a blackjack , brass knuckles , a hypodermic syringe  --  and a deputy sheriff 's badge . In his pocket was his membership card in United Klans of America , Knights of the Ku Klux Klan . It was signed by " Robert M. Shelton , Imperial Wizard , Tuscaloosa , Ala . " Wilson also had a black leatherette apron and a black hood , the historic trappings of a Klan executioner . Though law enforcement agencies have found it easy to penetrate the Klan with paid informers ? " They are less clever than the Communists , and easier to infiltrate " ? the presence of an informer does not mean that acts of terrorism can he forestalled . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other as they are with outsiders . The " action groups " within the Klan , known variously as " Holy Terrors , " " Knock-Off Squads , " and " Killer Squads , " range from three to a dozen men . Their identity may be known to other Klansmen  --  and to the FBI  --  but they lay their plans for lawless acts outside the Klavern meetings . " We 've learned not to discuss anything in a Klavern we would n't discuss on the courthouse square , " one Exalted Cyclops told a Post reporter . Many crimes committed by these terror squads are merely senseless acts of sadism . In Birmingham , for example , a Negro man walking home at night was caught , castrated , and warned that the same thing would happen to any Negro who tried to send his children to white schools . The victim of this mutilation was not married and had never taken part in any civil-rights action . Occasionally federal agents , through informers , sense a growing restlessness in a Klan and anticipate an outbreak of violence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it may take . When , for example , Lemuel Penn , a Negro educator from Washington , D.C. , was killed last July while traveling through Athens , Ga. , the FBI had only to go to its files and to the Athens police and sheriff 's office to come up with the names of a dozen suspects . Both the Athens officers and the federal agents had been watching the Athens Klavern of the United Klans . They knew 80 percent of its members . They knew the location of the pegboard on which the pistol-toting Klansmen hung their weapons before entering the Klavern sanctum . They knew also that certain truculent members of the Klan had been riding about Athens at night carrying sawed-off shotguns , " keeping an eye on the niggers . " Twenty-six days after the killing , a Klansman named James S. Lackey made a confession after only 14 minutes of questioning . He described how he had driven alongside Penn 's car while two other Klansmen , Cecil Myers and Joseph Sims , had fired into it with shotguns . At the trial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killing had taken place , Lackey repudiated his confession , claiming it had been forced from him " under fears and threats . " The jury found the accused not guilty . Almost as discouraging to federal officers was the subsequent disposition of the cases growing out of the McComb bombings . Nine men , including Paul Dewey Wilson , the man with the black mask , pleaded either guilty or nolo contendere to charges they had bombed or conspired to bomb three Negro homes . Circuit-Court Judge W. H. Watkins imposed prison sentences and fines , and then , citing their " youth , good families , " and the fact that they were " unduly provoked and undoubtedly ill advised , " he suspended all fines and sentences and placed them on probation . All were identified by the FBI as Klansmen , probably belonging to a splinter Klan group at the time of the bombings . To investigators , six had admitted being Ku Klux Klansmen and had implicated the others as Klansmen . One said he belonged to the United Klans . A month later J. Edgar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this action as " scandalous , " denounced " bleeding-heart judges , " and charged that " all the lynchings and bombings of homes in the South " are the , . vork of the members of the Ku Klux Klan and claimed the FBI " knows pretty well who they are . " Shortly thereafter Mr. Hoover proved that this claim was not mere bombast . On December 4 , his agents arrested 21 men , including two peace officers and a preacher , in connection with the killing of three civil-rights workers near Philadelphia . Miss. , last June . According to the FBI , the killings were planned and executed by the Klan . J. Edgar Hoover described most as Klan members and sympathizers . Police investigators believe all were affiliated with the White Knights of the K.K.K. The arrest of the two peace officers , Neshoba County Sheriff Lawrence A. Rainey and his chief deputy , Cecil Price , points up the problem the Department of Justice faces in investigating civil-rights cases in the South . In chasing down bank robbers and car thieves who cross state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agents . In civil-rights matters . particu lady when Klansmen are involved , they often not only refuse to cooperate but actually seek to hinder federal agents in tracking down the guilty . Wherever the agents work , they , of course , soon discover which policemen . sheriffs , deputies and highway patrolmen are in league with the Klan . and the names of these men are immediately reported to higher authority . In Mississippi until recently this was useless . Lately , however , Gov . Paul Johnson has sought to purge his highway patrol of Klansmen , and two cities , Laurel and Meridian , now require that all their employees , including policemen , sign an oath that they belong to no " subversive " organization . In Alabama . officers have been known to show a solicitude for bombers , arresting them on minor accusations  --  such as possessing explosives  --  before the FBI could bring graver charges against them . In Georgia . Klansmen are promptly fired from big city and state police forces . In North Carolina , Wizard . Shelton has publicly appealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranks , promising them super-secret new Klaverns in which they would he required to wear no robes , march in no parades , and endure the long Klan ritual only once a month instead of weekly . Though most North Carolina peace officers have ignored Shelton 's blandishments , his success at organizing regular Klaverns in the Tarheel State has startled federal officials . A little more than a year ago the Klan there was dead . It had been an object of derision since 1958 , when a sometime preacher named the Reverend " Catfish " Cole attempted to hold a cross-burning in a cornfield near the little town of Max ton , an area heavily inhabited by Lum bee Indians . As the robed preacher began his invocation , there came a wild shouting from the surrounding woods and a band of Lurnbees , some in war paint and feathers , swarmed into the clearing firing pistols and shotguns . Led by the Reverend Catfish , the assembled Klansmen hoisted their bed sheets up around their hips and took off through the thorny yaupon scrub , uttering mindless cries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Klan became a laughingstock . Today , under the ambitious proselyting of the United Klans ' Grand Dragon , J. Robert Jones , onetime sailor , bricklayer and lightning-rod salesman , the Klan has made a fantastic comeback . In a series of articles in the Charlotte Observer , reporters J. K. Batten and Dwayne Walls estimated that the state now has some 25 active Klaverns , with a membership of 2,500 paying members . Batten and Walls , in their reports , vividly depicted a typical Klansman . " He was coarse , unshaven and loud , " they wrote . " He chomped an unlighted cigar and profanity came as regular as breathing . Yet for an instant tears streamed down his whiskered cheeks . ' My country is going to hell . ' he blurted brokenly . ' I hate to see that . These crooked , corrupt politicians are doing it . . . by raising up the niggers . The white man is God 's servant , and the nigger is the white man 's servant . That 's the way it was meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be , by God . ' They quoted another Klansman , a filling-station operator , " his hands caked with grease , his arms blue with tattoos " : " ' The Jews have got the B'nai B'rith . The Catholics have got the Knights of Columbus . The niggers have got the N.A.A.C.P. Tell me what in hell the white man 's got , besides the Klan ? What has the white Protestant American Gentile got except the Klan ? It 's the poor bastard like me who pays the taxes . He keeps the wheels turning . ' " These vignettes point up the deep angers and frustrations that motivate the rank-and-file Klansman in North Carolina and throughout the South . He is rebelling against his own ignorance , ignorance that restricts him to the hard and poorly paid jobs that are becoming scarcer every day . He is angered by the knowledge that the world is passing him by , that he is sinking lower and lower in the social order . The Negro is his scapegoat , for he knows that so long as the Negro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be somebody on the social and economic scale who is lower than he . In the Klavern , in his robes , repeating the ancient ritual , he finds the status that is denied him on the outside . Despite the rush to join its ranks , the Klan in North Carolina so far has proved to be a feckless organization . An unsuccessful attempt was made to prevent volunteer workers from the North from painting a weatherbeaten Negro schoolhouse ; an effort to prevent Negroes from integrating a restaurant by squirting them with hoses resulted in the arrest of two Klansmen ; and a few crosses have been burned , one on the lawn of the governor 's mansion . Otherwise the Tarheel Klansmen have seemed content to meet in their Klaverns and make angry speeches . Even there they do not conduct themselves as seriously as their grimmer brethren to the south . In one Klavern , Batten and Walls reported , initiation rituals are enlivened with a prank . The neophyte is required to watch while a piece of iron is heated white-hot and thrust , sizzling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is then reheated , the quaking candidate is blindfolded , his trousers are lowered , and a piece of Dry Ice is pressed against his backside . With a piercing scream the victim leaps galvanically while the assembled Knights guffaw , Attorney James Venable of Atlanta , who is Shelton 's prime competitor in the Klan business , would probably look with scorn upon such desecration of the ancient ritual . Venable is head of a group called the National Knights of the Ku Klux Klan , Inc. , and of another that embraces 19 small , independent Klans in Georgia , Alabama , South Carolina , Tennessee and North Carolina , and he looks upon himself as the robed prophet and spiritual heir of the original Klan of the 1860 's . A florid , blue-eyed man in his middle 50 's , his eyes grow moist and his voice breaks when he speaks of how the Klansmen of that day saved the South from carpetbaggers and renegade freedmen . He refers with great nostalgia to the 1920 's , when the Klan was at its peak of four million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governors , congressmen and senators in half a dozen states . Venable , a Klansman since he reached man 's estate , was attorney for the United Klans until 1963 . He then pulled out , chartered his own National Knights , and is now in competition with his old Wizard . Like Shelton , he professes to abhor violence , and he has been heard to describe some members of the United Klans as a " bunch of wild-eyed sons of bitches . " He says that he does not do much recruiting in the South . " We are working in virgin soil , " he said . " We are planting the seed in the Midwest and the Far West . They are crying for us outside the South . and we are answering the cali . " This seems true , for Klan watchers report revival of the order in West Virginia , Indiana , Minnesota , Iowa , Pennsylvania , Wisconsin and California . Though Venable deplores violence in his affable conversations with reporters , his public utterances , and those of his subordinate leaders , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away by his own oratory , according to an investigation report , he told a rally at Stone Mountain that a few people , white and black , should be hanged to show that the Klan meant business , and he suggested that standing in a schoolhouse door was no way to stop Negro children from entering a whiteschool ; hanging a few Negroes on the school ground would be much more effective . His comment on the Penn murder case was blunt : " It just shows that you wo n't never convict a white man for killing a Negro who is encroaching on the white people of the South . " Speaking at a National Knights rally in September , 1964 , Grand Dragon Charlie Maddox of Savannah , a brusquely outspoken man , told his audience : " We need to do a lot to stop the liberal legislation of these national politicians . A boy down in Texas did a lot already , remember ? " It seems obvious that the Klan of the middle 1960 's is , as Venable likes to describe it , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the same armed underground . the same secret guerrilla force , mocking by its actions the teachings of the Christ it pretends to honor , striking furtively and savagely at the foundations of the democracy it purports to defend . It is potentially more dangerous than the old Klan of the ' 20 's , which was finally destroyed by the venality and corruption of some of its leaders and by the arrogant lawlessness of its vicious hoodlum fringe . Itsleaders are not interested primarily in the money , but are grimly dedicated men determined to maintain while supremacy at whatever cost , Numerically , the Klan still is weak . The best official estimates place the number of active dues-paying Klansmen in the South at fewer than 10,000 , with 2.000 in Mississippi , 1,500 each in Georgia , Alabama and North Carolina , 1,000 in Louisiana , 500 each in South Carolina and Tennessee . Loyal to many leaders , operating mainly in their own regions , they are less an organization than the manifestation of a state of mind  --  the despair of the poor white in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They are , in short , an underground movement whose basic weapon is terror . There are hopeful signs . Organizations of decent citizens , as in McComb , Miss. , at last are speaking out openly against the anarchy of the Klan . In many a small Southern city ; schools are being integrated without violence . Merchants , ignoring Klan threats , are complying with the Civil-Rights Act , and private citizens , when warned that they must fire a Negro servant , aretelling Klan tormentors to go to hell . And here and there a tough sheriff or police chief warns Klan leaders that if Klan gunmen want a showdown fight , his men are ready . " I 've told Shelton if his Klansmen ever try to do anything to me or my family . I 'll kill him , " said an Alabama police chief . " And if they get me first , I 've got some boys in my department who will kill him . " Always in the past the Klan has destroyed itself by its own excesses . Events of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already gone far down the road to its own destruction . The recent arrests of Klansmen may result in no convictions and no punishment . But the faces of the Klansmen have been exposed . They have been seen in daylight , in the courts , glowering sullenly or grinning arrogantly at the cameras . They now are recognized , not as folk heroes , but as what they are  --  the misfits , the bitter rejects of society . It is impossible to believe that the millions of decent . law-abiding , truly religious citizens of the South will long permit their lives to be dominated by such as these .
