txt Washington Washington is willing to out-wait Madrid . Both now maneuver for position , waiting for negotiations to renew the American military bases treaty . In a subtle diplomatic game , the Franco regime , in effect , postponed the treaty talks with Deputy Defense Secretary Roswell L. Gilpatric . They were set for Feb. 15-16 . Now officials here believe the Spanish are hoping to take advantage of the " post de Gaulle " atmosphere . Perhaps they want to get more ' economic aid from the United States , and to influence the Americans to support a closer Spanish tie to NATO and even to lay a groundwork for any active European Common Market candidacy . Status Stressed Spanish sources here say their government will demand a greater voice in European defense strategy as part of the treaty renewal price . Beyond this , Madrid hopes to achieve , overall , more status for the Franco regime in the eyes of the Western world . This is seen as a pretty big order and it is believed here that the Spanish are biting off much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House-State Department stance , Sen. J. W. Fulbright ( D ) of Arkansas , influential chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , says , " We would not concede anything . " Talks Due Soon Speaking of any increased rental for the four military bases , he says " the contract should stand where it Let them take it or leave . He terms such an increase - arbitrary . " ( The United States has spent $2,000,000,000 in Spain in the last decade . ) ? The Spanish had felt their strongest negotiating position was to point out to Mr. Gilpatric  --  who now is expected to appear in Madrid within a month or six weeks  --  that the large American - built naval base at Rota is indispensable to the evolving American nuclear strategy . In Rome Mr. Gilpatric has just completed arrangements for sending submarines and Polaris missiles into the Mediterranean in April . The Spanish felt that Rota was the obvious base for the submarines . Now officials here insist the Spanish bargaining position really is n't that strong . They say the United States Navy has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that all three would be more convenient than Rota . They are not identified . Balance or Payments Rota is regarded as an important installation but not a ' key base in Polaris planning . Another point of Spanish leverage in the negotiations is the gold-dollar drain that continues . This whole question of the balance-of-payments problem has gained further urgency following the de Gaulle action against the British and his anti-American policicfs . The French hold large sums in gold in the United States that they could call for at any time . Much of the financial drain is due to the spending of tremendous amounts to keep American military forces overseas . The largest number of forces is in Europe ? 400,000 men . In Spain . there are 30.000 military and technical personnel and families . This is costly in terms of dollars . The United States is trying to get the Spanish to spend most of this money for American products , including military gear . Madrid-Paris Axis ? But the Spanish have been playing " hard to get . " It is understood that this item @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gilpatric is going to Paris to discuss the whole question of American troops in Europe with Clem Lyman L. Lemnitzer and Thomas K. Fin-letter . United States Ambassa  --  dor to NATO . They will further plans for the removal of about . 40,000 American troops over the next two years . Many of them would be taken out of the supply operations in France . As for Spain . officials have said the Spanish want to get themselves out of the " client " role . But it is not felt here now that a possible Madrid-Paris axis has much chance of developing . perhaps to be used as more leverage on Washington . Spain is not thought to be willing to move very far toward General de Gaulle . if only because of the two personalities involved . General Franco has his own pride . However , in the next month or so the Spanish probably will he willing to give the impression that a shift toward Paris is possible . It is all part of the negotiating game .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
