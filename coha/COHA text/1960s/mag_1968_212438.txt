In its efforts to doctor the ailing U.S. merchant marine , the Government has often proved as ineffectual as the barnacle-crusted maritime industry itself . Transportation Secretary Alan Boyd not long ago virtually threw up his hands over the prospect of winning general agreement on a plan to renovate the aging U.S. flag fleet , whose dwindling capacity has been strained by the pressure of supplying the Viet Nam war . After months of contentious hearings , the Federal Maritime Commission , however , has just approved a stride toward greater efficiency . By a 3-to-2 vote , the commission authorized the merger of three West Coast companies into the nation 's largest ship line . <P> The three concerns-American President Lines and Pacific Far East Lines , both based in San Francisco , and Seattle 's American Mail Lines-would form a combine with an estimated $156 million in annual revenues , $261 million assets and 51 ships ( plus eleven more on order ) plying mostly the transpacific and Far East trade routes . The new firm , probably to be named American Steamship Lines , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies . <P> Combined Savings . The merger , largest in U.S. maritime history , aims principally at foreign competition , notably that of merged Japanese lines . The Federal Maritime Commission held that the merger would help the three U.S. companies by permitting several million dollars a year in savings through combined operations-without damaging rival U.S. ship operators . The arrangement would also give a new dimension to the career of Oilman Ralph K. Davies , 70 , chairman of A.P.L. , who controls all three of the merging lines through a complex of stockholdings . <P> Virginia-born Davies joined Standard Oil of California as an office boy at 17 after graduating from high school in Fresno ; he rose to be a director at 32 and senior vice president at 38 . Though many oilmen had tagged him as a future president , Davies and Standard parted company after his wartime service as Deputy Petroleum Coordinator under the industry 's old scourge , Interior Secretary Harold Ickes . Davies then founded American Independent Oil Co. ( he has since sold his interest in it ) , later bought control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which dredges for gold in the Peruvian Andes , owns chunks of industrial land near Sacramento , runs a West Indian oil refinery with Standard of Indiana , holds large oil exploration rights with Sinclair in Java and along the Red Sea . Such far-flung operations have made Davies many times a millionaire ; his Natomas shares alone were worth $17.9 million on the New York Stock Exchange at week 's end . <P> From a 22nd-floor penthouse overlooking the San Francisco waterfront , Davies manages these interests amid such antique decor as a rifle marked with Indian scrolls and a collection of Charles Russell oils , watercolors and bronzes depicting scenes from the early American West . He also prides himself on his collection of Indian relics , which he keeps on his 10,000-acre Lake County cattle ranch , 90 miles north of San Francisco . <P>
