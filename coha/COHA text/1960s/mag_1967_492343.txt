The last campaign of boxing 's last angry man I got into Seattle a week before the light , and jack met me at the airport . I had n't seen him in eight years . but there he was at the edge of the crowd , craning his neck and then waving . He looked older , of course , and thinner and paler . and there was a dark green glass over the right lens of his bifocals . " How are you ? " I said , as we shook hands . With Jack you always know what the answer to that one is going to be . The moment you ask the question you get the feeling that you 're the straight man in an act . " No good , " he said . That had to be the truth . though . He 's wracked with the rheumatism he says he picked up in France during World War 1 , and in addition to that the surgical profession has been whittling away at him for years . A long time ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tonsils and his appendix out , and then , after he retired Billy Petrolle in 1934. they took two thirds of his stomach because of ulcers . While they were still trying to cure sinusitis with surgery . he had 23 operations , and recently I had read in The Ring that he had had cataracts removed from his right eye . " Who hit you in the eye ? " I said now , " AIL " he said . " Cataracts , so I decided to go for the operation . " " Good , " I said . " That 's one they 've become very proficient at . " " Do n't I know that ? " he said . " So what happens ? When it 's over , I say to the doctor , ' Now , Doc , I understand that after ninety percent of these operations , the patient 's sight can be corrected with glasses to twenty-twenty . Is that right ? ' So he says , ' Well , that 's about right . ' So I say , ' But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , am I ? ' He says , ' Well . no . ' So I say . ' All right . How good is my sight gon na be ? ' He says , ' Well , pretty good . ' " Now would n't you know that ? " Jack said , that pinched look of disgust coming over his face . " Ninety percent are successful , but I have to he in the other ten percent . Why ? " " I do n't know . " I said . " Now tell me something else . " he said . " What does he mean by ' pretty good ' ? Just how good is ' pretty good ' ? " " I do n't know that , either . " " I ca n't see a damn thing . " Jack said . " Oh , hell . I can see some , but at the hotel I 've already fallen down the stairs twice , and now I 've got ta have the other eye done . How about that ' pretty good ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last of the great old-time fight managers . Time has taken the rest of them  --  Jimmy Johnston and Jack Kearns and Pop Foster and Billy McCarney and Dumb Dan Morgan and the others . Television killed off the small fight clubs , and prosperity and the rise of reason have left boxing as an almost meaningless appendage to our society , and now Jack Hurley , starting all over again with a new young heavyweight , remains from what used to be . " So how 's your fighter ? " I said now . We were walking over toward the baggage counter . Any time you ask Jack to tell you about a lighter of his it 's like giving a diabetic a shot of insulin . " Wait 'll you see him , " he said , stopping . " Boone Kirkman . His first name is Daniel , so his friends call him Boone . For a while I thought I 'd have him fight as Daniel Boone Kirkman , but then I figured that that kind of thing is n't any good anymore . Am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jack named him " The Fargo Express . " Petrolle was of Italian descent , but he had high cheekbones to go with his black hair and dark eyes , so Jack got him an Indian blanket to wear into the ring . Petrolle was one of the great lightweights and had one of the great trade names and one of the great trademarks of another time . " You 're right . " I said now . When Petrolle retired after 255 fights and built a new home in Duluth. he wanted to hang that Indian blanket on the wall of his den . " But it 's got blood on it , " his wife said . " Not mine , " Billy said . " Boone Kirkman . " Jack was saying . " twenty-one years old . six-feet-one , one hundred and ninety-five pounds , and he comes to fight . Most fighters today . they 're in there just to get enough money for an education or for the down payment on a house so they can get married . Not this one . All he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rings you know it . " Just think of this . He 's had four professional fights . Three of them went one round and the other guy lasted three . That 's all , but Boone Kirkman knows more about fighting than any of those other heavyweights in the ring today . He actually knows more than the heavyweight champion of the world . " " I believe it , " 1 said , because I know what Jack teaches a fighter . " Is n't that terrible ? " Jack said . " What do you think of that Clay ? " " Well , " I said , " you 've got to give him one thing . He 's a fine natural athlete . " " Yeah , " Jack said , that pinched look coming over his face again . " for track and held . What 's that event where the one guy does everything ? " " The decathlon . " " That 's right , " Jack said . " Cassius Clay would be great in the decathlon . Why . they talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why , Dempsey would not only have chased him out of the ring , but he 'd have chased him out of the arena and then right out of town . " Wait 'll you see this Kirkman. though . " he said . " You 're gon na get a thrill . 1 mean it . Wait 'll you see the way lie makes those moves . Have you ever heard me say that another lighter of mine reminded me of Petrolle ? " " No , " I said . " Well , this kid does , " Jack said , " and that is my highest compliment . " Petrolle was the best Jack ever had and one of the best anyone ever had . He never won the lightweight title because Jack steered him away from it for years . Jack feels that once you win a title , II ommissions run your fight e ; , he ? le could make 1 , lights and min it . When I lo retired he ha , .. it Liattiihno anti Canzoneri and In IcLarnin , whit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lich was ? 1 ImIncy in 1934 . A If , Pal rolle quit . I he Associated Press ran a Jack was looking for a new lighter , , ? of hundred candidates showed up in Duluth , there was n't a good prospect in the lot , and Michigan Street was so loaded with guys that the police department came after Jack , and he had to pay the fare home for half of them . Almost any other light manager would have found a way to make a buck with some of that muscle , but when it comes to teaching a lighter , Jack is a purist . In the 5 ; ) years he 's been in the business , Jack has n't had more than a couple of dozen fighters . For five years . in the ' 40 's , he was the matchmaker and one of the promoters for the Chicago Stadium . Then a few years ago he filled in between lighters by beating the bushes as the advance man for the Harlem Globetrotters in the Northwest . The two lighters of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vince Foster and Harry Kid Matthews . Foster was a half-Indian welterweight out of Omaha who was all mixed up with whiskey and women and the Bible . The night in 1949 when he knocked out Tony Pellone in Madison Square Garden we all thought Jack just might have another Petrolle , but then Charley Fusari knocked Foster out in one in the Garden , and two months later he was dead in Pipestone , Minn .. after running his car up the back of a truck . Harry Kid Matthews was a light heavyweight out of Seattle who 'd had 70 fights in 12 years and was getting nowhere when Jack took him on late in 1949 . Before he was done with him , Jack actually started a congressional investigation to find out why the International Boxing Club would n't give Matthews a light in the Garden . When Matthews finally did tight there , he licked Irish Bob Murphy in one of the all-time classic exhibitions of body-punching ever seen anywhere , and we thought Jack was on his way again . " And he 'll do the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , " if I can just get him the tight . " He believed it , too , because that 's the kind of a pitchman Jack is . By the time he gets done selling the press and the public on one of his fighters he has sold himself , and he had $10,000 bet on Matthews when they climbed into that Yankee Stadium ring against Marciano . With all those good moves , though , Matthews could n't hurt The Rock , but The Rock could hurt him and flattened him in the second round . " Now is n't this something ? " Jack said , when we got out of the cab at the Olympic . " 1 checked in here for a week to manage that Matthews , and I 've been here seventeen years . You have to remember , too , that I got the two worst things in the world for this climate  --  rheumatism and sinus . " It was from room 679 at the Olympic , just big enough to contain the bed , the steamer trunk , the footlocker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corona portable , that jack sent out the publicity that , along with what he taught him about fighting , made Matthews into a leading contender and started the congressional investigation . At the time Jack was spending $10,000 a year for stationery , stamps and the newspapers that carried stories about him and his fighter . " Do n't write about me on Sundays , " he used to tell his friends on the sports pages . " Sunday papers cost more and you 're running up my overhead . " It was out of room 679 , too , in 1957 , that Jack promoted the Floyd Patterson-Pete Rademacher fight for the heavyweight championship of the world . Cus D'Amato was protecting Patterson then and he accepted Rademacher , who was the Olympic heavyweight champion but had never had a professional fight , as a likely victim and Jack as the logical promoter . It was good picking , because Jack forgot for a while that he has no use for amateurs and , out of his pockets and a box under the bed , he sold $74,000 worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had Patterson clown in the second round before Patterson knocked him out in the sixth . " Just think , " Jack said , after it was over . " An amateur did this for me . I guess it just goes to show there 's some good in everybody . " " Ail right , " Jack said now . after I 'd checked into my room and the bellhop had gone through all that business with the window shades and the closet doors and the bathroom light . " Let 's go down and get something to eat . " " Eat ? " I said . " It 's the middle of the afternoon . " " You know me , " Jack said . " You know I have to eat every three hours . " Jack hates to eat alone , and that 's how Ray Arcel , who was training fighters then , came to call lam - The Life-Taker . " Jack was around Chicago al . I he tins ' . They had just taken away two thirds rif his stomach , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was during theDepression , " Ray told me out ' night , " and Jack had just retired Petrolle and lad money , so he 'd take these poor guys who were half-starving to eat with him . Jack would have a bowl of soup , or milk and crackers , but they 'd order big steaks . One guy ate so much that Jack had to buy him a new suit of clothes , and another one actually ate himself to death . That 's how I came to give Jack the name . " They say around Seattle that while Jack had Matthews he used to spend $1,000 a month feeding sportswriters and cops and press agents and hangers-on . Whenever Jack had it , he spread it , " When Petrolle was fighting , " he told me once , " I loaned out sixty thousand dollars . I had it all in a little book . Then , when I had the ulcers and I went into the Mayo Clinic , I sent out eight letters and six telegrams to guys who owed me five hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 've got seventy-five thousand dollars more standing out since . " So that first afternoon I walked Jack down Fourth Avenue to his favorite cafeteria and watched him have a bowl of soup and a sandwich and a cup of tea . Then we walked over to the Eagles Temple at Seventh and Union , where the fighter trains , and all along the way people recognized Jack . " How are you , Jack ? " they 'd say . " No good , " he 'd say . " Why , Jack ! " they 'd say . " How are you feeling ? " " No good , " he 'd say . That 's the way Jack is . One noon he sat down with me in the restaurant in the hotel , He 's been at that hotel so long now that just about everybody on the staff knows him , and when the waitress came over she was smiling . " Why , Mr. Hurley ! " she said . " Hello , Hilda , " Jack said . " Mr. Hurley , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm going to say . " " What 's that ? " Jack said , squinting up at her . " You 're looking much better than the last time I saw you . " " Is n't that terrible ? " Jack said to me . " You know that 1 set the world 's record for those sinus operations . They found out with me that there 's no sense in operating . I was a guinea pig for medical science , just a living sacrifice to make the world safe for guys with bad noses . " That first afternoon , though , when we looked at Jack 's fighter , I could see why Jack was high on him . He 's a dark-haired. dark-eyed kid who looks right at you , and you can tell that he 's not going to be cowed by anybody or anything . He 's got a good pair of legs , but the best of him is up in the arms , chest and shoulders , and he 's just the right height to carry 195 pounds and still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand and think they 're boxing . " How long have you wanted to be a fighter ? " I said to him that first day . watching him wrap his hands in the soiled gray gym bandages . Jack does n't pamper his lighters . " Since I was a little kid . I guess . " he said . " My Dad used to tell me about Dempsey , and now he says I look like him . " " Were you a street fighter ? " " Yeah , " he said , looking up from the bandaging and smiling . " I was always lookin ' to fight somebody . You know , just for the fun of fightin ' . " " Have you got a job now ? " " That 's right . I 'm a pipe-finisher . Those manhole pipes . " " Five days a week ? " " Six . " he said . " Weekdays from six in the morning till three-thirty in the afternoon , six to two-thirty on Saturdays . " " When do you do your road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three-forty-five . " " Acid you run in Ihe dark ? " " Around the high-school held in Renton . " he said . That 's where he lives with his folks , 12 miles south of Seattle . " You see ? " Jack said . " He 's no ( like these pantywaists they call lighters today . " They have the ring set up in a second-floor room at the Eagles Temple . The R. , orn is about 35 feet long and about 12 feet wide , and the ring . old and with the canvas soiled and torn , iills the far end . " So he was the 1965 National A.A.U. heavyweight champion . " Jack was saying while the lighr getting into the ring , but he was like all an 1,1 ours  --  awkward and overanxious and just a wild right-hand swinger . For six months , every day , we worked on the footwork . His stance was too wide , so I had to tie his feet together with shoelaces and a piece of inner tube that would give about two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . and this is a long . tedious thing . You get so sick and tired of it , but it 's balance and leverage that make punching power . " All right . " he said to the fighter . " Move around . Let 's see how fast you can move . Now slow it down . Good . " You see ? " Jack said to me . " He slows the action down to where he wants it  --  to one punch . I 've taught him that speed is detrimental , because if you 're moving fast you 're also moving your opponent fast . If you 're out hunting , would you rather shoot at a slow-moving or a fast-moving target ? It 's the same thing . He 's been taught how to put two thirds of that ring behind him . He does n't want it , but those jabbers and runners do . and he deprives them of it . " Jack had the fighter box three rounds then . but there 's the same shortage of fighters in Seattle as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with had been around Jack and the fighter too long . As soon as the fighter would start to build up a move , the light heavyweight would know what was coming . but you could see one thing . You could see that this Kirkman is another Hurley fighter , and if you know anything about fighting , you can tell a Hurley fighter from the others as easily as an art expert can tell a Rembrandt from something by Harry Grunt . Ever since Jack worked it out with Petrolle , those Hurley lighters have come out with that shuffle step . the hands low and in punching position , and they just invite you to lead so they can move off it , step in and knock your block off with the counter . " But do n't you see ? " Jack was saying to the fighter when it was over . " You were jumping in instead of sneaking that right foot up . You got ta sneak it up so they do n't know it 's coming . They think you 're just jabbin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move the artillery up behind the jab . I do n't even care if the jab misses . " Boxing is like a chess game to Jack . It 's all position and planning your punches two and three moves ahead , and I can remember Jack telling me he 's always been able to look at two fighters and tell in a round exactly what each has to do to lick the other . " I do n't know why it is , " Jack said once . " There are guys who have never seen a piano before who can fool around with one for a few minutes and then play something . I could sit at a piano for three years and I would n't be able to play Home , Sweet Home , but I can figure fighters . " Jack is out of Fargo , N. Dak . He was 13 when his father , who was a switchman on the Canadian Northern , was killed pulling a coupling between boxcars. and Jack , who was the second oldest of live kids , had to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Northern Pacific in Fargo , and when you 're guarding a corner you learn how to light . Also , there was a gym in the basement of Saumweber 's barbershop in Moorhead . Minn. , just across the Red River , and Jack used to hang around there . IL was as natural for Jack to execute boxing moves as it was for him to take a deep breath. , but he found out that he just did n't have the body for it . " Then I got the idea of using the talents of others , " he told me once . " I figured that if I could get half-a-dozen kids and get them each a fight a month , I could make more money than if I was lighting myself . " Jack was 18 when he started managing fighters , but when the war came . Jack dropped them and got into it . He was with the First Division . and for a while they were in a town called Heudicourt in the St. Mihiel sector , and the British sent in a sergeat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He was a miserable s.o.b .. " Jack said , " hut he knew his business . He 'd stand there unarmed , with his hands down at his sides , and he 'd say , ' Stick me ! ' You 'd have your rifle with the bayonet fixed , and you 'd make a lunge at him , and you 'd miss . Maybe the next time you tried your rifle would go flying up in the air , or you 'd get the butt of it under your chin . " Jack said this Cassidy did it all with feinting and footwork . He 'd draw you into a lead , and that would be the last you 'd have to do with it . You 'd be the one with the bayonet , but you 'd still be helpless . " I used to go and see this guy at night . " Jack told me . " His stuff fascinated me. so one night said to him , ' This puts me in mind of boxing . ' He said , ' The bayonet manual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the on-guard position and I take the rifle out of your hands , you 're standing like a boxer . Now I put the rifle back in your hands , and at the command of " long thrust ! " you make a left jab . Now you move your opponent out of position . and you come up to hit him with the butt . Is n't that the right uppercut ? ' " It was the footwork that got Jack . though . This Cassidy would stand right there and he would n't move his feet more than a couple of inches and still they could n't reach him with the bayonet . " If a boxer would master this shuffling style , " Cassidy told Jack , " he 'd be as safe as I am now and he 'd save all those thousands of fancy steps . " " And ca n't you see it now ? " Jack said , when he told me the story . " As you look back on Petrone. ca n't you see where I got that famous shuffle step ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't have to go over there until two days before the light , so for live days 1 followed Jack around Seattle . With Jack eating every three hours and not going to bed until two or three in the morning because he has trouble sleeping , we spent a lot of time sitting around restaurants and cafeterias and the lobby of the hotel with Jack 's cronies , talking about the way things used to be and the way they are now . That 's Jack 's one hobby . " Is n't it terrible , the condition the fight game is in today ? " Jack would say . You would n't believe it , would you ? A lot of Johnny-come-lately booking agents who call themselves managers and do n't know the first thing about it . Amateurs ! Why , amateurs just clutter up the world . " Look at what that television did , too. - he 'd say , " and it 'll do it to pro football next . Why , you ca n't give your product away free and have people still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It would even cheapen the Second Coming . " " And how about women ? " I said to him one night , playing the straight man again . " Have you explained women to this fighter ? " Jack made one unhappy try at marriage , and women are another of his pet peeves . Jack wants his fighters to be fighters and nothing else . He wants them to be the fighter he 'd have teen if he 'd had the body for it , and he 's always afraid that some woman is going to spoil all his work and wreck all his dreams . He 's always afraid that some woman is going to come between him and his fighter , and over the years some of them have . " The ' creatures ' ? " he said now . " I 've explained it all to him . I 've told him , ' Look , marriage is for women and kids , and it 's expensive . You 've got to he able to afford it . Your best chance to make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then you 'll be able to afford marriage . ' He understands the point . " Did I ever tell you . " Jack said , " about the fighter I had who started looking at the creatures . and one day he went to the movies ? When he came back . I said , ' How was the picture ? ' He said , ' It was good . It was a Western . ' I said , ' Any dames in it ? ' He said . ' Yeah , one . ' I said . ' How many guys were after the dame ? ' He said , ' Three . ' I said . ' Anybody get killed ? ' He said . ' Yeah , two . ' I said , ' The dame one of them ? ' He said , ' No . Just two of the guys . ' I said , ' There ! Does n't it figure ? Do n't you see how the odds are stacked for those creatures ? ' It did n't do any good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " who was starting to think he was in love . You can tell when they do n't have their minds on their work , so one day we 're walking along the street and the light changes , and I said , ' Wait a minute . ' Next to us is this creature with a little creature , about three or four years old , and the little creature is all dolled up and has a little pocketbook . I nudge the fighter and I said to the little one , ' Hello , little girl . That 's a very nice pocketbook you have there . Do you have any money in it ? ' So she says , ' Yes , three pennies . ' So the light changes again and they go on their way . but I say to the fighter , ' Do n't move . ' Here comes another creature now with a little boy , and the light changes again , and they stop . I nudge the fighter again . and I say to the little boy , ' Say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're wearing . Do you have any money in your pocket ? ' The little kid looks up at me , and he shakes his head , and he says , ' hope . ' " So I say to the fighter , ' You see that ? That little creature with the pocketlxiok is being educated in how to handle money . This poor little mule here is being ! aught nothing . All he 'll be taught when he grows tip is to bring the paycheck home each week to the creature . Do n't you see that ? ' You know what the fighter said to me ? " " No . " I said . " He said . ' But , Jack , my girl is different . ' Now the light changes again , and this time I go my way . Is n't that terrible ? " Late every afternoon , of course , we 'd be over at the Eagles Temple , with Jack hounding the fighter . No matter what the fighter would be doing ? boxing . shadowboxing. punching the bag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , no , " Jack would say , the fighter shadowboxing around the ring . " Do n't set your feet . Just walk . Now the left hook to the head . You 're too tense . Just turn with it . All right . Now you jab , and the guy is a runner . so you 're too far away . Now you got ta step again . Now the guy is pulling away , so you got ta throw three punches , but only one is gon na land . Good . Now you 're with a guy throws a uppercut . Now turn away so it misses and throw the right hand up into the body . Good . " You see ? " Jack said to me . " He 's like a pool player . practicing those draw shots . He 's got ta get that ball back there , so he practices hour after hour until it becomes instinct . Like a pool player he 's also playing position at all times , and you know how long this practice lasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he quits , and you know something ? If he 's having trouble hitting a left hook to the body . it 's nothing for me to sentence him to two weeks of doing nothing else . He wants to learn it to get rid of me . " All right now , " he 'd say to the fighter . " you 're in there with one of those runners , so you do n't want to scare him or he 'll start running again . Easy now . Left hook to the body . No , no . Let him see it . Start it back farther so he 'll be sure to see it . because you want.thim to drop his hands . Good . Do that again . " You see ? " Jack said to me . " Other guys breed fear , but then it 's like cornering a frightened pig . This guy has been taught to encourage them . to make them feel safe . He 'll sometimes miss a jab to give ' em courage . and Petrolle even had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know , he 'd catch those suckers walking right in . " The last afternoon , though , Jack was discouraged . We had to be in Boise the next day so Jack could go on TV and radio and talk up the fight . and the fighter was going to come in two days later , just in time for the weigh-in , with Marino Guaing. the little Filipino who trains amateur fighters around Seattle and helps Jack . " No , no , " Jack was saying , to the tighter , watching him hit the big bag . " The left hook is too tight . It 's got to be looser . Just throw it up there . No good . Your feet were off the floor . No . Bend those knees a little : It 's like you 're on stilts . " Is n't that terrible ? " Jack said to me , turning away from the fighter and shaking his head . " He never did that before . You got ta watch ' em every damn minute of every day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lighter . " Easy . Now increase the power a little . Now you 're going stiff-legged again . Start over . " The sweat was dripping off the fighter 's chin . The floor under the bag was speckled with it . but Jack was still unhappy walking back to the hotel . " Now where would he have picked that up ? " he said . " You see what I mean ? He picks up a bad habit . or he goes on the road and he steps on a pebble and he turns his ankle . He 's liable to sleep with the window too wide and catch cold . He conies to the gym and he may get his eye cut or hurt his hand . " That 's why , " Jack said , " when you manage a fighter you end up with cancer . heart trouble or ulcers . I took the least . " " But look at the rewards . " I said , hoping to kid Jack nut of it .

Why , Petrolle would spend six rounds setting ( lie other guy up and , after he 'd belt him out , they 'd say , ' My . he was lucky . ' I 've told this guy , ' You 'll never get any credit . They 're just gon na think you 're lucky . ' You raise him like a baby , " Jack said .

He needs a little quiet advice , but no one sees that , so they see me up there , and they say to the lighter , ' What 's he do for you ? ' Twenty guys say it and it means nothin ' . By the time eighty guys say it , though , the lighter forgets . This one will too . " I 'll tell you , " Jack said . " Regardless of the outcome , this is my last fighter . " At 7:30 the next morning I met Jack in the lobby , and Harry the bellhop carried our bags out and wished Jack luck . In the cab on the way to the airport Jack was looking at the heavy traffic heading into town . " Look at the mules , " he said . " Is n't that terrible ?

I just looked up Petrolle 's record again to see some of the towns they hit together from 1924 to 1934 ? Sioux City . Hartford , New York , St. Paul , Newark . Milwaukee , Grand Rapids , Duluth . Chicago , Philadelphia , Akron , Bismarck , Indianapolis , La Crosse , Cedar Rapids , Schenectady  --  and he took Matthews to London . " You care where you sit on the plane ?

I think I slept an hour , so I want to grab a little nap . " We were the first on the plane , and I had Jack take the window seat . I reached up and got him a pillow , and he had just settled his head back and closed his eyes when 1 heard the small voice right behind us . " Eee choo-chop , Mamma ? " the voice was saying . " Eee choo-choo ? " " No. " the woman 's voice said . " Not choo-choo. dear . Air-plane . " " Eee Chou-shoo ? " Jack opened his eyes . He had that pinched look on his face again , " Is n't that something ? " he said , shaking his head " With the whole plane to pick fi nn I a draw a creature awl I I. H . l n't you know ? T l those eye opera- too , but I got ta be in OW ' Men ten percent . " It did n't make any difference , because Jack was n't going to sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes when Jack 's rheumatism started to act up . and he had to stand in the aisle , holding onto the arm of the seat , almost all the way to Boise , " Is n't that terrible ? " Jack said , as we were getting off . " A whole plane , and that creature and the kid have to sit behind us , " " But he was a cute kid , " I said . " Yeah , you 're right , " Jack said . " I took a look at him , and he was . " Then Jack really went to work . After we checked into the hotel we walked down Main Street to Al Berro 's place . Al Berm is the local fight promoter , but for a living he runs the Bouquet Sportsmen 's Center . The Bouquet has one of those long Western bars down the right side , with the meal for the day chalked on the blackboard at the far end , and along the other wall a half dozen tables with faded green baize covers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I glad you 're here ! " Berro said , shaking Jack 's hand . " Flow 's it look ? " Jack said . " Fair , " Berro said . " I think we 'll do all right , but I 've got you lined up for the radio and TV . You ready to start ? " " I guess so , " Jack said . In the next eight hours , with Berm driving him around town , Jack was on two television and four radio stations , and at nine o'clock that night he was over at The Idaho Daily Statesman . " Now what brings you to Boise ? " one of the writers would say , as if he did n't know . " Well , I 've got Boone Kirkman boxing Archie Ray , from Phoenix . at the Fairgrounds arena on Thursday night , " Jack would say . " My best friends in the boxing game tell me I may be making a mistake , though , because my fighter has had only four fights and Archie Ray has had twenty-three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What 's going to happen at the Fairgrounds arena on Thursday night ? " another would say . " Well , it 's hard to tell , " Jack would say . " All the people in the fight game tell me Archie Ray is gon na lick my fighter for sure , but of course I do n't think so . " " Jack , is Boone going to shoot for a first-round KO , " another would say , " or is he going to play with this fella ? " " He does n't play with anybody , " Jack would say . " You see , all my boxing friends tell me Archie Ray is gon na be too much for my guy . but we 'll find out Thursday night at the Fairgrounds arena . " Jack did some job . Knowing how he feels , and that he had n't slept much the night before , I was amazed that he got through that day . " Ah , I do n't have the enthusiasm anymore , " he said , when we got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beat , " I said . " I 'm old and I 'm sick and I 'm tired . " he said , " but you ca n't let the bastards know it . They 'd kill you . There 's nothing I 'd like better than to sit back in that rocking chair . " " I do n't believe you , " I said , " One titles &; days , " Jack said , " I 'll just eh n at that veterans ' home and sal , ell , I 've gone as far as I can . ' You know I 've got my burial suit , do n't you ? " " No , " I said . had it for years , " Jack said . " I ? , rice in a while I try it on to see that ii lits . I had a thousand-dollar insurance policy I sent to my brother over in Fargo . I said , ' When I check out , this is for the burial , but nothing fancy . Just have them sharpen the feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day of the bout , the fighter and Marino , the trainer , got in about 20 minutes before the one o'clock weigh-in at the state capitol . When we got back from that , Jack had the fighter rest until 3:30 , and then we took him to the restaurant across the street from the hotel . " You 'd better bring him two of your top sirloins , " Jack said to the waitress , " and a baked potato and hot tea . " " The baked potato does n't come on the menu until five , " the waitress said . " In Idaho ? " the fighter said . " Is n't that terrible ? " Jack said . looking at me . " You see ? They want you to eat the way they want . " After the fighter finished eating he took a walk with Marino , and Jack went down to a caf ? he likes on Main Street and had a ham sandwich on whole-wheat bread , sliced bananas and a cup of tea . At 7:30 Jack was sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down from their rooms with Marino carrying the fighter 's black zipper bag . " Listen . " Jack said to the fighter , " when you finished eating across the street there , did you remember to tip the waitress ? " " Gee , no , " the fighter said , " I forgot . " " Here . " Jack said , handing him a buck . " Go over and do it now . " When the fighter came back we all got in a cab and went out to the Fairgrounds . In the dark the cabbie missed the main entrance , so we rode around between a lot of barns before we got to the arena with the sign SALES eaviLioN over the door , " You see ? " Jack said when we got inside , the customers milling around us . " It 's like the old Cambria in Philadelphia . " From where the ring was set up in the middle of the floor the solid planking of the stands goes back and up like steps on all four sides right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You gon na fill up ? " Jack said to Al Berm . " I do n't know , " Berro said . " I 've got eleven hundred and fifty bucks in. and I 've only collected at the Stagecoach . Hannifin 's and a couple of others . I 've got . Homedale and Mountain Home coming in yet . so we 'll do pretty good . " " There goes that ' pretty good ' again , " Jack said . They had the fighter dressing under the stands in a small room with a washbasin and a toilet in it and a shower without any curtain around it . There was no rubbing table , only a green painted bench , and when the fighter stood up he had to he careful not to hit his head on the naked bulb sticking down from the ceiling . It was hot in the room , so the fighter had stripped down and was in his black trunks with white stripes . He 'd put on his white socks and was lacing his ring shoes . Through the wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preliminary . " Marino , " Jack said . " Tell them I 'm gon na start bandaging and to send somebody over if they want to watch . " " But I just there . " Marino said . " They do n't come in vet . " " Then the hell with them , " Jack said . " I 'm gon na start anyway . " " Oh . excuse me , " one of the customers said , looking in . " I thought this was the men 's room . " " Next door , " the fighter said . " This will go on all night , " Jack said . " They sell a lot of beer here . " With his bad eyes Jack had to squint to see what he was doing , but after bandaging fighters ' hands for a half century he could do it with his eyes closed . While it was going on  --  the gauze around the wrist , and then across the palm , and between the thumb and index finger , and then back around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then the tape  --  we could hear the crowd hollering and then , over our heads , the stamping of the feet . " All right , " Jack said to Marino when it was over . " Grease him up . " Marino rubbed the cocoa butter on the fighter 's arms and shoulders and chest and neck and face . When he had finished , Jack sent him to watch the other people bandage and put the gloves on . The lighter was sitting on the bench . his bandaged hands in his lap , serious now . " The hell with them , " Jack said after a while . " We might as well get into the gloves . Then you 'll have plenty of time to loosen up , because they take that intermission to sell more beer . " " Good , " the fighter said . Jack helped the fighter into the right glove first , the laces down the palm and then around the wrist , then tied , the ends cut and a strip of tape over it . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . " They all done now , " he said . " Al/ right , " Jack said to the fighter . " Loosen up , but be careful of that light . Now jab ... hook .. jab ... move up behind it . All right , but do n't stand there . You got ta move right up behind it . And another thing . if you start to miss punches just settle down and start all over again , " " I know , " the fighter said . " We 're ready to go , Jack , " Al l3erro said , sticking his head through the doorway after the fighter had had about five minutes of it . " You ready ? " " Yeah , " Jack said , and then to Marino : " You got the mouthpiece ? " They went out and down the aisle , Marino first , carrying the pail , and then the fighter and then Jack . The aisle was crowded , some of the customers still trying to get back to their seats with their containers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stands . " Hey , Jack ! How many rounds ? " . . " Good luck . Jack ! " . . . " Hey , Kirkman , how about our money 's worth tonight ? " When the bell rang , Jack 's fighter walked out in that Hurley style , hands low , and he walked right to that Archie Ray . Archie Ray is a straight-up fighter , with a pretty good jab and a straight right hand , and he started out to make a fight of it . He punched right with Jack 's fighter , and I gave him that first round . Jack had n't said a thing . but now he was up in that corner , bending over the fighter and lecturing him , and when he came down the steps at the start of the second round I could see he was still mad . " Hey , Kirkman ! " some loudmouth was hollering . " You 're gon na get yours tonight ! " " His stance is too wide , and his feet are too flat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ? " " He 's tense , " I said . " He 'll fight out of it . " " Tense , hell , " Jack said . " He 's never been like this before . " He did n't light out of it . In the second round you could see he was trying to settle down and put his moves together , but he was still too anxious . The young ones , if they 're real fighters , are usually that way . They know what they 're supposed to do , but then they get hit a good punch and they widen that stance and start swinging because they want to end it with one sock . Jack 's lighter was still throwing punches from too far out , but he was hurting Ray with right hands . You had to give him that second round and the third . too , although he came out of a mix-up he should never have been in with his nose bleeding . " Hey , Kirkman , " the loudmouth was hollering when he saw the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Is n't this terrible ? " Jack was saying . " All he 's got to do is jab and move up before he lets those right hands go . What 's the matter with him ? " " He 's still trying too hard , " I said . " Hell , " Jack said . In the fourth round he had Ray against the ropes and then through them , but he could n't finish him , and in the fifth round he dropped him with a nice inside right hand to the body and still could n't put him away . Ray looked as though he was in there just to stay now . and by the sixth round you could see Jack 's fighter tiring , the way they all do until they learn pace . He 'd be all right for the first half of a round , but then he 'd flatten out and start to flounder , in the eighth round , though , he made one good Hurley move . He drew that right hand of Ray 's , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back with his own . It was a little high  --  on the cheekbone ? but it caught Ray following through . and Ray 's knees started to go as he backed off . " He 's got him now . " I said to Jack . " And everybody in the house knows it but him . " Jack said over the roar , and by the time he said it , the chance was past . " Is n't that terrible ? " That was the last round , and it had been enough of a war so that the crowd liked it . Jack 's fighter got the unanimous decision , but when we got to the dressing room he was still disgusted , and Jack was too . " I swear I can fight better than that . " the fighter was saying to two of the local sportswriters . " That 's the worst fight I 've ever had . " " He was in a trance , " Jack said . " He could n't even follow orders , and he always follows orders to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like I was in a fight , " the fighter said . " I ca n't understand that , " " The hell with it . " Jack said finally . " Let 's get out of here . " An hour later we were still sitting in the restaurant across the street from the hotel . The lighter had had a milk shake . and Jack was nibbling at a ham and cheese on whole wheat and still going over the fight . " He comes back at the end of the first round . " he said , " and he says , ' I 'm not sick , but something 's the matter with me . ' " " That 's right , " the fighter said . " So I said . ' It 's too bad , but you 're here . You 're having a bad night , but you 'll fight out of it . You 're punchin ' from too far back . Jab and move up and then wing those right hands . ' " So you got him against the ropes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he 's lookin ' for the punch . ready to duck it . and you give it to him , instead of the jab . Let him duck the jab and into the right . " " I know , " the fighter said . shaking his head . " Now you know what it takes to be a lighter . " Jack said . " You 've got to settle down and live it and sleep it and eat it . " " But I do , " the fighter said . " But you 've got to do it more , " Jack said . " You ca n't afford bad nights like this . " " I know , " the lighter said . The fighter left then to pick up a couple of the display cards with his picture on them . Jack and I walked out on the street . " That 's the worst I 've seen him . " Jack said . " He knows how to do those things . Why could n't he do them ? How could he possibly be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said . " When you figure it out , he 's had six rounds of professional boxing before tonight . You know it takes time . " " But I have n't got too much time . " Jack said . We shook hands , and I watched him start down the almost empty main street of Boise , Idaho , at one o'clock in the morning He was heading for the Bouquet Sportsmen 's Center to find out how much money there 'd been in the house .
