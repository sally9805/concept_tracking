txt A record school budget that would provide for an attack on the rising student dropout and absence rates in academic high schools was proposed yesterday by Dr. Nathan Brown , the Acting Superintendent of Schools . The request , which is subject to the change and approval of the Board of Education and then Mayor Lindsay , called for an operating expenditure of $1,635,964,293 for the fiscal year beginning July 1 . This ' is an increase of $379,590,511 , or 30 per cent , over the current year 's allowance by the city . The budget takes into account the decentralization of the city school system , which is to take effect next year . Of the increase sought , $98-million would go for new and expanded school programs and services . The remainder , $281-million , would cover mandatory cost increases , such as higher staff salaries . More Money Needed " The $98-million would help us bring about many significant improvements , " Dr. Brown said . " But it would take more than double our entire budget to really meet all our needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dr. Brown proposed , for example , the establishment of 15 additional schools for pregnant girls , bringing the number of such schools to 20 . He also urged the expansion of efforts to combat the use of narcotics by assigning a coordinator for narcotics education to each high school and district office . Among the new programs Dr. Brown proposed were the fol-lowing : CA $10.4-million effort to lower the dropout rate in the high schools . cm. one-year pilot program intended to give middle-class teachers a better understanding of slum children . About 240 teachers and their classes would spend one-week periods at camps outside the city . E1The allocation of $4.7-million to provide " equal educational opportunities " to Negro and Puerto Rican pupils who attend schools outside their communities under the " open enrollment " or school utilization programs . QA $6.2-million campaign to provide educational opportunities to handicapped children who are not now admitted to school . cThe establishment of new pilot programs , costing $720 , - 000 , to provide challenging educational opportunities for gifted children . Several proposals deal with the expansion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following things : $3.4-million appropriation to make possible increased psychiatric , psychological and social work services for children . 9IAn increase of $17.4-million for school maintenance and repairs , bringing the total next year to $33.9-million . New Teachers Proposed The budget request also provides for the employment of 5,789 additional teachers ? the system now has 60,000 ? and 1,800 other school staff members . Some of the new teachers will be employed in the new programs planned . Others would be needed to instruct the 45,000 additional pupils the city expects next year . The present public school enrollment here is 1,164,974 pupils . In previous years , school budgets have emphasized the need to strengthen the school system 's " early childhood " education program for pupils in kindergarten and the early elementary grades . Dr. Brown said that this was still a concern and that the program would be continued next year . But , he said , other critical needs have emerged . Dropout Rate Rises After many years of progress in cutting the high school dropout rate ? the percentage of students who leave before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the academic schools , the Superintendent said . In the 1962-63 school year , the academic high school dropout rate was 8 per cent and the vocational high school rate was 14 per cent . Last year , Dr. Brown said , the academic school rate climbed to 10 per cent , while the vocational school rate declined to 13.6 per cent . Attendance in the academic high schools , the Superintendent went on , generally ranges from 73 to 83 per cent . By contrast , the vocational schools have a range of 73 to 88 per cent . Ten years ago , Dr. Brown said , the academic schools had an attendance range of 85 to 92 per cent . The 63 academic high , schools , which traditionally have enjoyed greater prestige then their vocational counterparts , have an enrollment of 235,000 students . The 28 vocational schools have 40,000 students . Dr. Brown attributed the situation in the academic high schools to many factors , including overcrowding , the fact that many students were admitted with serious academic defifiencies , and the feeling on the part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not relevant . " To counter this trend , the Superintendent proposed the following measures : ll1The employment of 116 additional attendance teachers and 346 " paraprofessionals " ? specially trained community persons ? who would serve as assistant attendance teachers . cThe expansion of successful existing high school programs , including those for collegebound students . 41/en increase in remedial reading and guidance services . cThe establishment of followup programs to " recapture " dropouts and the provision of pre-employment training programs during after school hours as a means of retaining students until they are ready to go to work . cThe establishment by the school system of 12 additional " Street Academy-type " schools , in cooperation with the New York Urban League . The academies , originated by the Urban League , are generally unconventional storefront schools providing flexible programs and intensive services designed to meet individual needs . Under the school decentralization law enacted recently , operating authority over elementary , junior and intermediate high schools will pass to locally elected community school boards next year . The city board envisions the establishment of 32 local school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programs , such as those for handicapped pupils , will remain with the central Board of Education . The shift to a decentralized operation is reflected in the proposed budget . Nearly $740-million was listed for district activities and services . Each community board would get $25,000 for its operations and $387,471 for its district headquarters . However , Dr. Brown said that a " more realistic " formula for making allocations to the community school districts was being worked out in accordance with the decentralization law , and that this could result in changes in the sums now listed for the districts . The funds allotted to the districts  --  with the exception of small sums for special or emergency needs  --  are not physically given to the districts , but are spent in their behalf by the city . This applies also to the funds of the central school board . The Superintendent noted that he proposed some of the pilot programs  --  such as the camping project for teachers and their classes  --  in the expectation that if they proved successfully they would be taken over by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drafted by Dr. Brown after consultation with local school boards and district superintendents . The budget message included requests for funds for the city 's three small decentralized demonstration districts ? Ocean Hill-Brownsville in Brooklyn , the Intermediate School 201 complex in Harlem and Two Bridges on the Lower East Side . Last month the Board of Education , in announcing its proposed community school district plan , said that under the decentralization law the demonstration districts must be made a part of larger regular districts . Dr. Brown said that if this happened , the funds earmarked for the demonstration districts would be given to the districts absorbing them . In a move to develop greater student participation in school affairs , Dr. Brown proposed the creation of a $300 , - 000 student activities fund . This would enable schools to do away with the usual requirement that only students who paid dues to the school 's General Organization could vote on school matters . The fund would subsidize such activities as school newspapers , dramatics and clubs that are now supported by G.O . dues . The budget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for school debt service , health services , heat , light and power . These costs totaled $164-million this year . The request also does not include an expected $117.4-million in Federal Elementary and Secondary Education Act funds , $43.5-million in State Urban Education Program funds and $15-million of other special allocations . Virtually all of these state and Federal funds will go to benefit disadvantaged children . Of the total school budget of $1.635-billion being sought for 1970-71 , 46 per cent of the funds would come from the state and virtually all the rest from the city . Dr. Brown said that the state 's share would decline from this year 's 49 per cent level , forcing the city to make up the difference . The Board of Education will hold a public hearing on the budget request on Jan. 5 , starting at 10 A.M. , at its headquarters , 110 Livingston Street , Brooklyn . Applications for speaking time must be sent to Harold Siegel , secretary of the board , not later than next Monday . In previous years , the board has generally increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mayor . The city administration , in turn , then generally trims the request . Last year , the Board of Education refused to go along with all of the city 's cuts and a compromise of sorts was worked out .
