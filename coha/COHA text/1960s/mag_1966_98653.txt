Philadelphia is the home of Tradin ' Joe Kuharich , a man with a low regard for independent thinkers . Tradin ' Joe does all the thinking for the Eagles . This has caused him difficulty with the team 's stars , who , as stars will , have confessed to notions of their own about how football should be played . Two years ago Kuharich shipped out Quarterback Sonny Jurgensen and Flanker Tommy McDonald for excessive thinking . This year he traded two of his best defensive men , Linebacker Maxie Baughan ( five times an All-Star choice ) and Back Irv Cross , to Los Angeles for the same offense . Baughan and Cross had both complained about the amount of blitzing required of them . // While some fans are sharply annoyed at Kuharich for these trades , there are others who believe that he had to shake the team well to break up cliques and mold it into an effective unit . " The Eagles do n't need stars , " Kuharich says . " We need players whose level of performance does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cross are good players , but for one reason or another they were not consistent , and this hurt us. " // There is no question that the Eagle defense needed something . While the 1965 offense was as productive as any in the East , the defense did not do its share . The team lost nine games by an average of only 6 ? points each . // Kuharich has begun to remodel his defense with two men obtained in the L.A. trade  --  Linebacker Frank Brown , who weighs 232 pounds , and Back Aaron Martin . ( Philadelphia also received Flanker Willie Brown in the deal . ) Kuharich spent his first two draft choices on defenders  --  Ends Randy Beisler and Gary Pettigrew. // One key to the team 's defensive prospects is the left linebacker , Mike Morgan ( 6 feet 4 , 242 pounds ) . He is in his third year and now may have the experience to play up to the potential of his size and strength . If Morgan has matured and the rest of the linebacking is consistent , pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gamble last year to cover for linebacking lapses . The defensive backs are quick enough but on the whole lack the height to cover tall receivers as well as Kuharich would like . Look for Joe Scarpati to handle the blitzing assignments that formerly fell to Cross . // In the line the Eagles have needed a better outside pass rush , which they may get in time from Beisler and Pettigrew . Overall the line is fairly good and is backed by a reasonably deep bench . Tackle Floyd Peters defends well against either the pass or the run and provides a strong inside rush . Tackle John Meyers is strong against the running game but is a little slow reading the plays as they unfold and is slow getting to the passer . // The offense again should be hard to stop . Quarterback Norm Snead , after a good 1965 season , had surgery on a weak knee and is in excellent shape . At his best Snead can call a smart game , balancing the strong Eagle running with accurate passes at short and medium range . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarterback who has knocked around for eight years but has never been No. 1 . Although he has a strong arm he is not No. 1 because he is terribly inconsistent . The Eagles ' No. 3 quarterback is the little-used scrambler , Jack Concannon . Tall and strong , a good runner and a pretty fair passer , Concannon could be valuable as a halfback . He can run well enough , and with the threat of the halfback option pass he could be doubly dangerous . // In any case , the Eagle running can be outstanding . Now that Jim Brown has retired , the other Brown , Tim of the Eagles , is the most versatile runner in the game . He weighs 198 and can burst through the line or sprint around it with equal facility . He is at his fancy best when he breaks clear and shows off his repertoire of fakes or his tantalizing change of pace . Last year Brown was third in yardage ( 861 ) and first in average yards per carry ( 5.4 ) . // Brown usually lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a leg injury and the hit of the Eagle camp has been Israel Lang . A 230-pounder with speed and an unusual knack of keeping his balance in a thicket of tacklers , Lang is also a good pass receiver , as are most of the Eagle runners . A good thing he is , too , because the receivers are not the best around . An exception is old Pete Retzlaff , the All-League tight end , who is beginning his 11th season . Rookie Flanker Ben Hawkins of Arizona State is promising , but he will not make the fans forget the hands and moves of Tommy McDonald , at least not for a while . // Kuharich 's offensive line is excellent . Guards Ed Blain and Jim Skaggs can block ahead or pull out to lead running plays with power and dexterity . The huge tackles , Bob Brown and Lane Howell , are fine at pass protection . Brown , beginning his third season , weighs 276 and has become a tremendous all-round performer . Center Jim Ringo , the old Green Bay stalwart , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little too old for the position and a little too light as the monsters of the defenses keep getting bigger , but Ringo plays as if he were 10 years younger and weighs as much as he needs to . // The big question in Philadelphia is whether Tradin ' Joe 's deals and thought-control have transformed the Eagle defense into a reliable one . That is possible but improbable this year . The Eagles may finish as low as fifth in the East .
