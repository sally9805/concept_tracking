Princeton Weekend With the SDS At Princeton two weeks ago , over 40o members of Students for a Democratic Society from the New York-New Jersey area spent some hours together defining the enemy and discussing ways to defeat him . Most of the participants were in their early twenties . All are veterans of street and campus protest , and many have been arrested . Three are under indictment for inciting to riot . Most campus anti-war and anti-draft demonstrations in the Northeast in the past two years have been SD5 controlled . The " professionals " ( usually Marxist or socialist ) argued with the " left-wing adventurists " ( anarchists and nihilists ) . A leader of the Columbia University chapter , evaluating a demonstration against Secretary Rusk in New York last November 14 , attacked the " adventurists " thus : " Our weakness is in discipline . On the fourteenth we were to act as a group , organized with its own monitors to direct traffic and get at the limousines coming to the Hilton . It failed . We were to avoid the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only certain cars and we stopped all traffic . What we have to fight today , here , i5 the left-wing adventurists . They want to get the cop now , Rusk now , Johnson now . Out of 18o in my chapter , io are left-wing adventurists . And they are leading us blindly into December 4 a scheduled anti-draft protest at the armed forces induction center on Whitehall Street in New York City . Idealists ! Dreamers ! They lead us to disaster . " The Whitehall demonstration would be impractical , DECEMBER 9 , 1967 he thought : the streets around Whitehall are too narrow ; they allow the police to easily corner and attack the demonstrators , who are defenseless with no place to run ; they give the police a greater latitude of choice , because the press and spectators can be controlled . To this , another New York leader , an anarchist , replied : " Sure the damn streets are narrow . But narrow streets demand new tactics . Throw grease on the streets . They the police will try to ride down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Staten Island Ferry ? the cops will let the fascist pigs fight us . They 'll pour out of the subways once it starts . We 'll burn . But we 'll burn the streets first . We 'll be hit but we 'll hit the cops first . " Here someone shouted , " Knock down Whitehall , like the Bastille ! " He got a laugh , but the anarchist , taking him seriously , answered , " You ca n't . It 's like a fortress , literally . But it 's the best possible fortress because of what it stands for . It will be bloody but blood makes the liberals mad . And we 've got to make them mad . " They went on to discuss the point of their tactics . A young girl from New Jersey gave her opinion : " The role of students in this stage of the revolutionary movement is to plant seeds , to create alternatives . Make people disassociate themselves from a/ government that makes war . Americans have been brought up to believe that this is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 've got to make them see how bad the government is in order to make them resist . The polarity must be between the government and the people , not between the people themselves . We are wrong to focus their hatred against Johnson , to personalize it . It must be directed against the system , the government itself , against the idea of government . People must be made to understand that the government and the people represent two different Americas . They must learn to distrust all institutions . All tactics are symbolic now . All gains symbolic . Disruption is needed . " The girl 's position was supported by a young man from New York 's City College : " We are n't making resistance but disruption . Rebellion is premature . Tuesday Nov. 14 was an attempt to disrupt the ruling class . Nowhere should they be allowed to meet in peace . " But because he did not think that the protest at Whitehall would be effective , he too opposed it . At this juncture a student from Rutgers yelled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , proud of it ! I want to fuck . this goddam country . Destroy it ! No hope , not in 5o years . Tactics ? It 's too late . You 're dreamers . . . . Let 's break what we can . Make as many answer as we can . Tear them apart . " He was shouted down . The meeting broke early for lunch and I wandered around the campus and heard the band play for the Princeton-Yale game and saw the students with their dates wander toward the stadium ? as if no war were being fought and no people were in prison for opposing it , as if Harlem and Watts and the Mississippi Delta country did not exist , as if the world were just and men did not die senselessly . SDS spent the afternoon defining the enemy ? the Liberal Establishment ? and seeking to agree on the ultimate ends of resistance . " Elsewhere in the world people are oppressed , " a Barnard girl said ; " the majority is oppressed . , Force is obvious everywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the liberal is the enemy . They lead a silent majority turned on by democracy . And that majority 's been bought . The liberal has to be exposed . It is a liberal 's war in Vietnam , a liberal government , a liberal culture . They the liberals are the warmakers , the power brokers , the enemy . . . . So we must polarize the government , the liberal 's government , against the majority . Americans are idealists . We have to let them see that the government offends that idealism . " She proposed to do this by making each demonstration louder and more violent , until tb.e government is forced to pass repressive laws and take general repressive actions . The government , she thought , would fall if Americans saw that it could not maintain order except through strong-arm methods . And precisely those methods would offend American idealism , produce distrust of the government , and finally cause the people to challenge the government 's monopoly over terror and organize themselves to overthrow it . She gave , as an example of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of how the protesters rushed against police lines and then fell back into the mass of demonstrators lining Sixth Avenue watching . The police , in response , charged into the crowd of spectators and , unable to tell the demonstrators from the people , they tore out at everyone . " Women , some in evening dresses , who stood there hating us for being dirty and loud went home after the police charge hating the police and the man Dean Rusk they were protecting . Through disruption we have to implicate the indifferent , the innocent , so to speak . Plan strategic interruptions which will force the government to increase its control over the people until they will not take it any more . Like at Washington . The ' negotiate now ' people got hit over the head . Some of their blindness was kicked out of them by the cops . Those people . . . you have to take it home to those people , the fat liberals . They only act when they 're hurt . " They then turned to what ends the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power , " a girl from Boston said , " they simply alienate us from other people . We are more alone than ever . We ought THE NEW REPUBLIC to educate people first so they understand what we are demonstrating against and why . " A young man promptly seconded her proposition , saying : " Let 's stop the noise for a while . Tactics are being emphasized over political ends . The point is to stop the war . Whitehall is a massacre situation . It is unwise . We should reject it . " Another said , " We have to make it politically expedient for one of the parties to nominate a candidate who will end the war . " He was interrupted by an impatient student from Columbia , who said , " I do not see ending the war as our goal . Whoever is elected will not stop the war . The killing will go on , if not in Vietnam then somewhere else . Admit it . Make it bloodier until the Americans ca n't take it any more , until they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes war necessary . " He was joined by a Harvard student : " The end is revolution . Opposition to the war is simply a pretext to create a revolutionary class . Check off the liberal middle class . We only need three percent of the population to make a revolution . " Here they fell to discussing what they wanted the Second American Revolution to bring in . Most wanted some kind of highly decentralized system where quasi-monopolistic corporations and vast institutions would be broken up . They wanted an end to all killing . They wanted to return to a simpler , more responsive , more local form of government . Some wanted anarchy . Some wanted communism . Some wanted a government of world liberation which would free all men and then disappear . They decided several things before they left Princeton . If a strike came against public transportation in New York City they would support it in an attempt to win solidarity with the workers . They are very much aware that unionists oppose them as much as the " ruling class . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to middle-class bribes . Yet they feel they need them on their side . They also decided to support , physically , any revolt by Negroes in the urban centers of the Northeast . They expect Harlem to explode this coming summer , or next . They plan to be there . It gives them hope . Curiously , they who depend in large part on the Negroes ' revolt to usher in the New Age , are all whites . Finally , they decided to let each individual decide whether to be at Whitehall or not . They want to give their lives over to something grand , to affirm their importance through a steady , deadly movement toward an irrevocable act . As one of their booklets proclaims , they want to " create , at long last , a situation which goes beyond the point of no return . " To do this they seek to widen resistance , to compel greater and more severe governmental response , to force the uncommitted majority to take sides with them , to oppose the war , either as an end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shame more shameful still by making it public .
