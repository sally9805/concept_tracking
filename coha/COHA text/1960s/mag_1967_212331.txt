During President Sukarno 's konfrontasi with Malaysia , the Indonesian army equipped , trained and sheltered guerrillas to harass the Malaysians along the two countries ' common border on the island of Borneo . Now the move has boomeranged . Once Sukarno 's successor , General Suharto , had ended the foolish quarrel with Malaysia , the guerrillas were left on their own in the jungles of Kalimantan , the Indonesian part of Borneo . Peking , which sees the island 's large Chinese population as the advance phalanx for an ultimate Communist takeover , has been exhorting the mostly Chinese guerrillas not only to continue to offer a major challenge to neighboring Malaysia but also to turn on their former Indonesian mentors . <P> <P> Numbering 750 hard-core fighters , plus several thousand support troops , the guerrillas have repeatedly attacked Indonesian military sites and terrorized Malaysian border areas since July . They have also tried to enlist by intimidation Borneo 's primitive Dayak tribesmen , the descendants of legendary headhunters . This tactic provoked a reaction that their Maoist guerrilla handbooks did not even hint at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an avenging rampage of killing , burning and cannibalism against all Chinese . <P> No Homes or Hope . Last week TIME Correspondent Peter Vanderwicken , after a visit to the remote jungle battleground , filed this report : <P> It is an ancient tradition among the pagan Dayaks that collecting the severed heads of the enemy brings honor and virility . The guerrillas should have reckoned with this tradition when they butchered a dozen recalcitrant Dayaks in the village of Taum . Angry tribal powwows quickly followed throughout northwest Kalimantan , and runners were sent from village to village with bowls of blood , the signal to all Dayaks to get ready to use their homemade pistols , poison darts and machete-like parangs against the Chinese . <P> The Dayaks were soon engaged in a full-scale massacre . They attacked Chinese in their homes and in their shops , killing them , beheading them , even chopping out their livers and hearts and eating them . Before the Indonesian army could cool off the Dayaks , at least 250 Chinese had been slaughtered ; Catholic missionaries believe that as many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the traumatized Chinese have descended on the sleepy West Borneo port of Pontianak , where they live in dismal squalor . The Chinese are crammed into makeshift quarters , bathe in muddy , sewage-filled canals and wander aimlessly along the waterfront , many of them without homes or hope . Pontianak 's Communist propagandists could easily use these displaced Chinese as a breeding ground for more unrest and tension . <P> <P> Burrowed in Bunkers . A few Chinese are drifting back to their villages under the protection of reinforced Indonesian troops , but the guerrillas themselves remain threatening and elusive . As in Viet Nam , they burrow deep in underground bunkers and in mountainside caves , attack only when they consider the odds right . Two weeks ago , 500 guerrillas caught Indonesian troops in a heavy mortar barrage at Fir Mountain , near the Malaysian Borneo state of Sarawak , where the soldiers had stumbled upon a major guerrilla encampment . While the Indonesians flew in more troops , the Malaysians evacuated Indonesian casualties .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
