Things have come to a pretty pass when betting on golf gets as risky as betting on horses . It used to be that all anyone had to do was book both Arnie Palmer and Jack Nicklaus to win the big tournaments ; one or the other al most always did . Not this year , though.Palmer won the Masters . But who could have figured Ken Venturi to win the U.S. Open ? Or Tony Lema to rattle off four victories in six weeks , including the British Open ? Or Bobby Nichols to beat them all in theProfessional Golfers Association championship ? <P> If ever a tournament looked like a lock for the Big Two , it was the P.G.A . It is the only major title Palmer has never won , and he took a week 's holiday just to work himself up to proper pitch . Nicklaus was the defending champion , and he figured to know the Columbus ( Ohio ) Country Club like the back of his chubby hand - being as how he has lived most of his 24 years in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , did n't figure at all . He was lucky to be alive , let alone playing golf . A onetime caddie from Louisville , he was nearly killed in 1952 when a car in which he was riding went off the road at 107 m.p.h. , putting him in the hospital for 96 days with a broken pelvis , a spine injury , a concussion and assorted internal injuries . That ruled out such sports as football and basketball . But he could still play golf , and after college he turned pro , with so-so results : in five years , he won three tournaments , created his biggest splash in 1962 when he wound up third behind Nicklaus and Palmer in the U.S. Open . <P> A husky six-footer who hits one of the game 's longest balls ( he once won a driving contest with measured drives of 347 , 352 and 367 yds . ) , Nichols is known as a " trash player , " a scrambler , who sprays his shots like a 20-handicapper , plays best when he is in deepest trouble . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he drove into the rough four times - and each time got a birdie , with miraculous recoveries , for a six-under-par 64 , the lowest score ever shot in a P.G.A.championship . A second-day 71 was good enough to keep him out front , onestroke ahead of Palmer . Then came the third round , and not even Nicholswas prepared for what happened . <P> Carbon Copy . Teeing off at the start , he pulled his drive into rough , hit his second shot into a trap , somehow blasted out to within 10 ft. of the pin for a par four . The second hole was practically a carbon copy of the first:his drive landed behind a tree , his second shot found a trap-and he still got a par . On and on he went , playing as if he had taken lessons from Rube Goldberg-straying down an adjoining fairway on the eighth , bouncing his ball off a tree on the 15th , dumping his drive into loose sod on the 16th . Scores : two pars and a birdie . On the par-three 17th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tee shot off to his right and overhit his wedge recovery . So what happened ? The ball hit the top of the pin and dropped dead 1 ft. from the hole . Dazed , Bobby added up his day 's score -a one-under 69-and headed for a press conference . " Fellows , " he sighed , " you 'll never believe this , but . . . "
