For the first time in 16 months , a nuclear cloud columned up and spread its cauliflower shape above the earth . <P> At 6:30 one morning a robot control , operated by perforated tape , was set in motion to trigger an explosion atop a 300-ft. latticed steel pylon in the North African desert . The eye-melting flash turned the sky into brighter-than-day , and a mountain range on the horizon was illuminated like a stage setting . As the shock wave rolled outward , two men in Hammoudia blockhouse ten miles away were thrown on their faces . With this nuclear bang , set off last week in the heart of the Sahara , France shouldered its way into the world Atomic Club , as Member No. 4 . <P> Dead Calm . The usually reserved President Charles de Gaulle cried " Hurrah for France ! " and cabled ecstatically : " Since this morning she is prouder and stronger ! " Proud French officials said that weather conditions had been almost ideal in the red rock and sand testing area of Reggan , some 750 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ route between the Mediterranean Sea and the Niger River . <P> It was dead calm at ground level , but above 10,000 ft. , 60-m.p.h. winds caused a quick dispersal of high-altitude radioactivity . French patrols had already fanned out through the region , rounding up some 300 nomad tribesmen . Before the shot , radar screens swept land and air , watching for any movement that might indicate endangered humans . Because of the direction of the winds at the time , the French said there was little chance of fallout blowing toward inhabited areas . <P> " African Butcher . " Only France seemed to get pleasure out of its big bang . Japan and Morocco prepared formal protests . From Nasser 's United Arab Republic came the cry : " The government which has acted as a butcher in Algeria is now trying to act as a butcher for all Africa . " Prime Minister Kwame Nkrumah of the West African state of Ghana dramatically ordered the freezing of French assets ( estimated at $14 million ) until possible effects of the explosion on the Ghanaian population are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the French embassy . <P> The most curious official reaction came from the U.S. , which had provided no help and sent no observers . The U.S. State Department was unable to bring itself to congratulate an ally on its technical achievement , would say only in a one-sentence statement that the event was not " unexpected . " With whom this squeamish reticence was supposed to win favor was not indicated . Great Britain remained officially dumb as well , although the opposition Labor Party denounced the French . Unlike Red China ( " a defiance of world opinion " ) and East Germany ( " an atomic crime ! " ) , the Soviet Union merely expressed its " regret " in tones that indicated more sorrow than anger . On a visit to India , Red Boss Nikita Khrushchev took the Sahara detonation in stride , remarked casually that he still believed " France and President de Gaulle also want a relaxation in tensions .
