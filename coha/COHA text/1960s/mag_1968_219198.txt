Campaign Posters <P> Sir : It seems fitting that you should have Robert Kennedy as your cover subject May 24 one week following your analysis of poverty in America . Senator Kennedy is a man who has not sought to ignore the poor but rather to give them new hope . He has done this through identification with minorities . As the one candidate to be accepted completely by Negroes , he best offers the solution to America 's most distressing domestic problems-racial unrest and urban decay . <P> GEORGE M. ELLIOTT <P> Monrovia , Calif . <P> Sir : Hubert Humphrey first proposed or was largely responsible for the passage of important progressive programs that are now part of our way of life . They include Medicare , Food for Peace , the Peace Corps , the Disarmament Agency , the Job Corps , aid to college students , and key advances in civil rights . Kennedy has pioneered no single successful advance . He now tells us we must " move this nation in a different direction . " But exhortations do not make change . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only one has shown the ingenuity and political competence to bring about positive change . Humphrey will never stand for the status quo . <P> FRANK P. DIPRIMA <P> Plainfield , NJ . <P> Sir : Humphrey 's giddy " happy " politics is superficial and disgusting . Eugene McCarthy 's attempt is gallant but impractical . Kennedy seems to be the only Democratic candidate who has heard the nation 's heartbeat , eloquently expressed its melancholy , and injected a note of hope tempered with pragmatic realism . <P> STEVE SAVAGE <P> Nashville , Tenn . <P> Sir : If the Governor of Indiana had recalled his Kipling , he might have paraphrased about Bobby : <P> Some fools there were <P> And they made their prayer <P> To two million bucks <P> And a hank of hair . <P> C. W. TREICHLER <P> Glenside , Pa . <P> Colts on the Campus <P> Sir : Youth is fulminating all over the landscape , in walkouts , sit-ins , and other forms of exhibitionism . Seventy-five years ago , I inspired a walkout and was temporarily suspended . There has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I know-I have lived with them . The colt in the pasture sometimes kicks a hole in the fence . He will probably mature into a very fine horse . If he is to be trained it sometimes requires a tight rein and sometimes a flip of the whip on the buttocks . Most of these youngsters of ours will mature into substantial citizens and will add much to the social order of their day . But one thing they must learn now-that the frustration of the law means tyranny . <P> ERNEST W. TOWNE <P> Wollaston , Mass . <P> Sir : I was a part of the " silent generation , " stuttering in apathy with signs of decadence all around campus and submissive suffering on the faces of my fellow students . We shook our heads , walked away , and paid our dues for four years . But these student activists are getting things done-congratulations . <P> PAUL KACER <P> Moline , Ill . <P> Price of Poverty                   @ @
