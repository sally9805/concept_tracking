Few world commodities can excite international passions the way sugar does . Just a whisper that there would be a shortage ( caused by a poor European crop and a drastic fall off in Cuban output ) was enough to send sugar prices off on a speculative binge that in recent weeks shot the U.S. raw sugar price up to $13.20 per hundred pounds v. $6.60 in January . As everyone knew it had to , the bubble broke-and last week sugar prices came tumbling down to $10.50 by week 's end , with no sign of slowing . <P> Because of sugar 's peculiar marketing arrangements , the reaction in the marketplace to the prospects of a shortage was more violent than the facts warranted . Most of the big sugar-using nations grow enough beet or cane sugar to supply a great part of their own needs , and they contract in advance to import the extra sugar they need . The result is that only about 10% of the world 's requirements are sought for on the open market . The bidding by so many for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. last month declared that it was going to buy an extra 650,000 tons on the global market , the price soared . <P> Agriculture Department experts do not expect the world shortage to last long . The European beet crop planted this spring is doing much better than anticipated , and the high prices have set sugar growers the world over to laying plans to increase their production .
