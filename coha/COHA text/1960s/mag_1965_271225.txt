Determined to milk as much benefit as possible from U.S. antiwar demonstrations , the Viet Cong last week freed two G.I.s especially with the Vietnik audience in mind . The men were Staff Sergeant George E. Smith , 27 , and Specialist Fifth Class Claude McClure , 25 , both of whom had been Communist prisoners for more than two years . The Viet Cong delivered them , well fed and in apparent good health , to a Cambodian border post only a few hours after a V.C. radio station had broadcast that the G.I.s were being released " as a response to the friendly sentiments of the American people against the war in South Viet Nam . " <P> The Viet Cong seemed to get their money 's worth almost immediately . Seated on either side of a Viet Cong spokesman at a press conference in the Cambodian capital of Phnom Penh , the two Americans sharply denounced U.S. involvement in the war , praised their captors , and pledged to quit the Army to lead peace demonstrations . " I have known both sides , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States , " declared Smith , a ten-year Army veteran . He was returning home , he said , " so Americans can see the light about the war . " McClure , a six-year veteran , told how the Viet Cong had healed his wounded leg . " Had it been the Saigon government , I would have been tortured , " he said . <P> The men testified that they had been treated kindly , had been fed as well as possible , had not been required to do overly hard labor , and had been given books to read , Red Cross packages and mail from home . Both insisted that they had not been subjected to any form of brainwashing ; but the Viet Cong representative did let slip that " the good discipline of the prisoners " had been a major factor in granting their release . <P> Smith , a native of Chester , W. Va. , and McClure , a Negro from Chattanooga , were members of the same Special Forces detachment . They were captured when their camp 35 miles northeast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the fate of fellow prisoners who had been captured in the same action . Yet there was a press report from Washington quoting one of the prisoners-a Special Forces sergeant now in Germany-as saying that Smith had helped him escape from a cave in which they were both imprisoned , heroically sacrificing his own chance for freedom . And the parents of the two men reported that up to the moment of their release their letters had never reflected strong antiwar views . <P> More curious still was the fact that neither Smith nor McClure seemed in any hurry to leave Cambodia . Perhaps the Viet Cong themselves were not sure how well the two Americans might perform once they were out of Red reach and wanted to keep them under surveillance a bit longer .
