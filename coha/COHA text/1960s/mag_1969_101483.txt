Oh , it was a beautiful homecoming . The weather was as pretty as the queen , cool and crisp , and nobody minded a little wind . As people strolled from the stadium last Saturday they laughed and talked about how their unbeaten Wyoming had just manhandled San Jose State 16-7 , which made it hard to get up a real working anger against those 14 black athletes Coach Lloyd Eaton threw off the team two weeks ago . Coach Eaton had shown those protesters he could win without them . Good riddance , and never mind a lot of talk about civil rights , because this is Wyoming , and out here we do things our way . Like Coach Eaton told those athletes : Boys , if you do n't like the way we run things around here then you better go play at Grambling or Morgan State . Yes sir , and was n't that victory over San Jose State just glorious ? // " Yes , it was a glorious victory , " said Bill Waterman , smiling thinly , " and now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an NAACP lawyer out of Detroit , a short , rather round , quiet-spoken man , and he arrived in Laramie , Wyo. last week with the belief that the rights of a student should not be limited just because he is an athlete . His first move will be to seek an injunction against the University of Wyoming in federal court this week . " First we want to get the players reinstated , " he said . " Then we 'll go from there . " // Eaton abruptly dropped the 14 black athletes from the team on Oct. 17 , after , he says , they took part in a demonstration against Mormon racial policies , which exclude Negroes from the priesthood of the Mormon Church . Wyoming was to play Brigham Young University , which is run by the Mormons , the following afternoon . Eaton insists that his players act as individuals and not as factions , which he feels splits the team , and he became incensed when the Negro players appeared before him that morning as a group . " They came in together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It was simply a matter of discipline . Black or white , it did n't matter to me . They broke the rule and I told them they were no longer members of the team . " // All his life Eaton has lived by the rules . He is a stern disciplinarian who can neither understand nor forgive a breakdown in team unity . As a boy he had to help his father scratch a living from a tiny ranch in the Black Hills of South Dakota . During the Depression he worked his way through college by sweeping floors for 25 ? an hour . Nobody gave him anything . Nothing came easy for him and he feels that nothing should come easy for those who play under him . Until now his iron discipline has worked and worked well . The last three years Wyoming has been the Western Athletic Conference champion ; this year it has won six games , leads the nation in rushing defense and is ranked 16th . Next to two national parks , football  --  University of Wyoming football  --  is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at the university , Eaton has perhaps more influence than Dr. William D. Carlson , the president . He certainly is more popular than Stanley K. Hathaway , the governor . And now he is convinced that he is the target of a Black Power plot . // " We 've played Brigham Young for many years , " Eaton said one day last week . " Why have n't we had a demonstration before ? And we 've had Negro players here since 1960 . I 'll tell you why . This is the first year the Black Student Alliance has been on campus . Now they 're organized and ready to act . The WAC was picked because of Brigham Young . And we were picked as the trigger because of our rule against demonstrations . It all fits . " // " The whole problem is that no one understands us , " said Joe Williams , the Wyoming tailback and one of the team 's three captains before he became one of the exiled 14 . " If Eaton had , none of this would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We knew about the rule against protest and we went to him on that Friday morning only to see if we could n't work something out . We felt very deeply about this , but we just wanted to talk to him . We wanted to see if we could wear black armbands in the game , or black socks , or black X 's on our helmets . And if he had said no we had already agreed that we would be willing to protest with nothing but our black skins . " // Both sides agree they met first in Eaton 's office and that the coach took them into the field house . There they stop agreeing . Eaton claims he listened to them for 10 minutes and then told them that they were out . // " Like hell he gave us 10 minutes , " said Williams . " He came in , sneered at us and yelled that we were off the squad . He said our very presence defied him . He said he has had some good Neeegro boys . Just like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stupid for us to be protesting against a faith and a religion none of us knew about , " said Willie Hysaw , an ex-receiver . " Talk about stupid ! Do you know that Ted Williams another of the 14 is a Mormon ? " // When University President Carlson learned of the dismissals , he called the governor , who drove over from Cheyenne in a snowstorm . A board of trustees meeting was called hastily , and 18 hours later , early Saturday morning , the trustees announced that they were backing Eaton all the way . // Across the state support for Eaton poured in . The cowboy element was angry . When seven members of the faculty said they would resign unless the 14 were reinstated , the Touchdown Club in Casper said it was raising money to get the seven out of the state . The student senate came out in favor of a hearing on the issue  --  which caused the rest of the students to call for an impeachment of the senate . A faculty-student ad hoc committee was formed to investigate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper came out for the 14 , and then Phil White , the editor , resigned . Carlson called a press conference , was backed into admitting , unintentionally , that at Wyoming football came first and civil rights second . When he realized what he had said , the press conference was over . One member of the state legislature said that if Eaton backed down , there would be trouble with the university budget next year . Eaton was n't about to back down . // Meanwhile , at San Jose State the team voted to wear multicolored armbands against Wyoming in support of the 14 , and groups at other WAC schools demanded that Wyoming be dropped from their schedules . // " It 's building , " said Bill Waterman . " All across the country . Building and building . This will be a new day for the college athlete , both black and white . " // At Wyoming the Black Student Alliance said it would set up picket lines at the San Jose game . Governor Hathaway said he was ready to call out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The university , in an official letter , which Waterman has , said it understood on good authority that 2,000 Black Panthers were headed for Laramie . " That 's not only a lie , " said Waterman , " it 's criminal . " // On Saturday , an hour before the game , Vernon Breazeale , the chief of the Laramie police force , watched as an orderly group of 134 pickets circled 200 feet from the stadium gate . " One thing I want these kids to understand , " Breazeale said , " is that we are here to protect them , not to fight with them . Their fight is with the university , not with us . All the football players on the football team are good kids , both the black and white ones . Real gentlemen . I remember another coach we had here . He used to bring in ex-convicts to play . Real hoodlums . Always drunk , always in trouble . We used to club them over the head until the blood ran down the side of their mouths . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // He watched as a black girl silently carried a sign that said : " Something is happening here , but you do n't understand what it is , do you ? " // " I guess that sign says it all , " someone said . // " Yeah , I guess so , " said Chief Breazeale.
