Until now , most of the statements from the academic community about the war in Viet Nam have come from those on the protesting left . Last week 14 distinguished scholars , all experts on international affairs , issued a 6,700-word statement examining not only the U.S. involvement in Viet Nam but also the future of all Asia . They concluded that a Communist victory in Viet Nam would lead to a greater war later . <P> The man behind the move , University of California Political Scientist Robert A. Scalapino , has worried that too many of the dissenters ' caricatured criticisms were debasing discussion of the war , and that noisy campus demonstrations were convincing the nation and world of unanimous dissent by U.S. intellectuals . Scalapino conveyed his feelings to 13 colleagues , including Columbia 's A. Doak Barnett , Harvard 's Oscar Handlin and Edwin Reischauer , former U.S. Ambassador to Japan Under the sponsorship of the Freedom House Public Affairs Institute , a non-partisan educational organization , they got together for three days in October at Tuxedo , N.Y. , and began debating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The professors deplored " the recent rise of isolationist sentiment in the U.S. , " and the fact that " many Americans find Asia remote and marginal to their interests . " As for what the nation 's position should be , " The ability to develop and defend policies attuned to limited objectives-including a policy of limited war-has become the vital test of the U.S. today . Our opponents count upon our impatience , our impetuousness , our immaturity . They must be proven wrong . <P> " Let us cease defining and defending American foreign policies in grossly oversimplified terms . Let us also desist from the excessive spirit of mea culpa which permeates certain quarters of American society . " Since World War II , they said , the U.S. has performed remarkably well in international affairs . <P> The U.S. presence in Asia has been necessary to counterbalance Chinese power and prevent a major Asian war . " The task of simultaneously restraining China and incorporating China peacefully into the international community will not be easy , but it is one of the greatest challenges facing us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asia " comprises ten separate states and nearly 250 million people . This region may well hold the key to whether a political equilibrium for Asia as a whole can be achieved , a question which in turn affects the future of the entire world . " <P> During the past five years , conditions in Southeast Asia have justified " cautious optimism , " with most nations-notably Indonesia-displaying a capacity for pragmatic politics . <P> " The decision of the U.S. to main tain a presence in this region has been of crucial importance . Every political leader within the area now recognizes that without that presence , the political fate of the region as a whole would have been drastically different . The U.S. has bought time for some 200 million people to develop , without their ceaselessly being confronted with combined external-internal Communist threats . " <P>
