" We love Alice Marie , " pleaded Richard Combs , 25 , a husky sheet-metal worker of Old Bridge , N.J. But the plea was not enough for New Jersey 's Board of Child Welfare . Last week , in the state 's second highest court , the board moved to deny Gloria and Dick Combs 's dearest desire-to adopt their foster child , a gay , elfin four-year-old . The board 's reason : Alice Marie , according to social workers , is too bright to remain in the Combses ' " television-centered " household . <P> An abandoned child , Alice Marie has lived with the Combses since the age of ten months . Though the Combses agreed not to attempt adopting her , they found the quick , eager girl hard to resist . At two , she recited nursery rhymes . At 2 she was put to an IQ test , won a mark of 138-in the " very superior , " top 2% of the nation . " An endearing and charming youngster , " reported the examining psychologist . He prescribed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environment . " <P> " TV Morons . " Would the Combs home measure up ? A spotless $17,000 ranch house , it is filled with toys and African violets ; the yard has swings , a slide , a sandbox . On his $119-a-week salary , Dick Combs hoped some day to send both Alice Marie and his own two younger daughters to college . Nor was there any question of Alice Marie 's affection for her foster parents . Often she woke in the night , crying : " Mommy , are you still here ? " But the social workers were unsatisfied , lined up what they considered more suitable parents , a childless couple with 1 ) more money and 2 ) more " culture . " The Combses , said one official report , " appear to have little cultural interests , and the majority of their leisure time is spent watching television . There are few books , if any , around the home . " <P> " The state practically classifies us as TV morons , " countered Dick Combs angrily . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four times a week . " His favorites : Gunsmoke , Paladin , sports events ( " Am I supposed to be ashamed of that ? " ) . Said Gloria Combs proudly : " I was valedictorian of my graduating class at Middlesex County Vocational Technical High School , and I was on the honor roll straight through . " The Combses promptly put up a book shelf in the living room , stocked it with an encyclopedia , books on child care , and such eclectic volumes as International Atomic Policy and How We Drafted Adlai Stevenson . They have read few of the books , Dick Combs conceded . " But it was the only front we put on . If the state does n't like the way we live , that 's too bad . We 'll go on fighting for Alice Marie because we love her and she loves us . Is there a better reason ? " <P> " Bureaucratic Stupidity . " Last week , when the Combses ' lawyer appealed the case in court , he could cite no better reason . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case . All legal precedent was on the side of the child-welfare board , which has sweeping power over adoptions in New Jersey .
