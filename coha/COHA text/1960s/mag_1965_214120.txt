Last week the harassed Curtis Publishing Co. capped a year of bad news with the bleakest news of all : the company lost a staggering $7,624,000 in the fourth quarter of 1964 as compared with a $1,400,000 profit for the same period in 1963 . Total 1964 loss : $13,947,000 , second largest yearly deficit in Curtis ' history , surpassed only by 1962 's $18,917,000 . The company added that it would postpone April interest payments on its $9,970,000 outstanding debentures and was considering a recapitalization of its preferred stock . <P> Curtis announced at the same time that Matthew J. Culligan , who had been ousted as president and chief executive officer last October after being charged with mismanagement by revolting editors , would now step down as chairman and director . He will , however , continue to draw his $150,000 salary while working on special assignments : preparing a company history , scouting for broadcasting possibilities . Quipped Culligan , who had once confidently predicted that Curtis would be out of the red in 1964 : " I guess I should say that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lest anyone think he had succumbed to uncharacteristic modesty , he added : " What has been overlooked is the tremendous job I did from July 1962 through December 1963 . I saved the business . Somebody asked me , was I prepared for the revolt ? Was the captain of the Titanic prepared for hitting the iceberg ? I am gratified to have been able to make a contribution to Curtis during some of its most difficult hours . It is in the best interests of all that Curtis now be given the time without harassment to continue to improve its magazines and market them more effectively to advertisers and the public .
