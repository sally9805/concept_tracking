txt Taking issue with Secretary of State Dean Rusk , Senator J. W. Fulbright said today that a temporary halt in air strikes against North Vietnam might open the way to peace negotiations . Secretary Rusk said yesterday that the Administration ! had considered and rejected the ' idea of suspending the air raids because the action " would only encourage the aggressor and dishearten our friends . " President Johnson also com mented on the bombings in an Easter statement yesterday , saying he regretted that " the necessities of war have compelled us to bomb North Vietnam . " But he emphasized that the , United States was " ready tol begin discussions next week . tomorrow or tonight . " Senator Fulbright , Democrat of Arkansas , who heads the Foreign Relations Committee , said that he did not relish differing with the Secretary but that he believed that the bombings might cause the North Vietnamese to " dig in " and the Russians to decline to talk . " Of course , " the Senator said , " I should like to see a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be obtained , then I believe there might be some value in stopping the bombings temporarily . I do n't know if it would work , but it seems to me to be worth trying . " Senator Fulbright said he was standing on a statement he made in an interview recorded before Secretary Rusk issued his statement . In that interview , Senator Fulbright did the following things : gCalled President Johnson 's proposal for an international development program in Southeast Asia " a good bargain for us " at $1 billion . 9Proposed that foreign economic aid be channeled through the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development to get the United States out of the domestic affairs of other nations . ( ISaid aid should be cut off from countries that inspire attacks on American embassies and other installations . Here is part of the transcript of the interview : Q. Does the course we are now pursuing in Vietnam offer the best hope for an eventual satisfactory settlement or would you alter the course ? A. I have said on numerous occasions that I support the Administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tone of the President 's speech at Johns Hopkins . There 's one further aspect of it that I think has developed even more clearly in the responses . Within the near future , before the escalation goes too far , a temporary cease-fire might be advisable in order to give the people a little time to contemplate the trouble . Finds World War II Parallel The daily bombings are inclined to keep the atmosphere very tense , and I think perhaps , to make the North Vietnamese dig in , as in Great Britain where the Germans thought the British might sue for peace when they started bombing them in World War II . Well , it did n't work that way . No one knows if a temporary cease-fire , just to give opportunity for reflection and possibly to go to discussions as proposed by the President , might be possible . Maybe there are reasons why this is not feasible , but I 'm judging from the press reports , the action of the Russians , and some of the others , that would indicate that the prospects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bombings . Q. Do you suppose we could get an agreement for a cease- , fire from the Vietcong ? A. I mean we can control our own bombings . I mean the bombings on North Vietnam . But whether or not you could get a cease-fire throughout Southeast Asia is another problem . We believe that the North Vietnamese have great influence and direct much of the activity there . On the other hand , a guerrilla operation is not easy to put on a cease-fire basis quickly and easily , whereas we could stop the bombings merely for the purpose of seeing if there is any desire at all for discussions . The Russians have said , " How do you expect us to go to a conference ? or - even think of a conference as long as you are actively bombing them now ? " I do n't know what they mean by this , but you could find out , I think , whether it means anything if you say , " Well , we will stop bombing for an indefinite period . " Secretary of Defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have no indications that a cessation of the bombing would move the North Vietnamese to discussions leading to termination of their aggression in the south . " Mr. said to end the air strikes against the North without the North 's , terminating its aggression " would discourage and disheart- ' en the people of South Vietnam , "
