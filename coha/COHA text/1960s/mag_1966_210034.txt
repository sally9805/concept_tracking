HOSPITALS The Rectal Thermometer <P> Near dawn every morning , a nurse walks into the hospital room , wakes the patient and subjects him to what for many remains a humiliating procedure , although it has become routine : insertion of a rectal thermometer . " The importance of this entrenched practice , " said last week 's Journal of the American Medical Association , " is so universally accepted that , like the mechanics of normal breathing , it is rarely discussed or even considered . " <P> The time has come for doctors to reflect on it , says the A.M.A. , because the entrenched practice can be fatal . The University of Minnesota 's Dr. Justin J. Wolfson recently reported a case in which an eight-day-old baby died because the thermometer had pierced the wall of its rectum . Actual perforation of the rectum appears to be rare , says the A.M.A. , but " injury to the rectum by the thermometer is not uncommon . Severe bleeding , ulceration , abscesses , hematomas and scarring have been reported . " Autopsies indicate that rectal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> What is needed , says the A.M.A. , is a thermometer that will not cause injury . But no U.S. manufacturer has yet produced a safer thermometer at an economic price . A safer design , used in Scandinavia , has a slender sensing tip , similar to the American , but then broadens out to a flat shank , thick enough to prevent too deep a penetration . The best the A.M.A. can suggest is that nurses and mothers be instructed in how to insert a thermometer correctly , and told never to leave a child or a debilitated patient alone with the thermometer in place .
