Emile-Antoine Bourdelle , who was born 100 years ago in the French town of Montauban , said all his life that his talent came from four sources , all in the family . His father , a furniture maker , gave him his sense of architecture . His uncle , a stonecutter , taught him the secrets of stone . His maternal grandfather , a weaver , gave him his sense of color , and his other grandfather , a shepherd , taught him his love of nature . <P> How this heritage worked out is something art lovers all over the U.S. are now seeing for themselves . A small retrospective opened at Manhattan 's Slatkin Galleries last November , after a month in Ottawa . It went on to Toledo , last week opened with 89 items at the St. Louis City Art Museum , and will go later to Santa Barbara , San Diego , San Francisco and Cincinnati . <P> Carvings in Chalk . At school , young Bourdelle paid no attention to his studies . At the end of each day , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from chalk and wood . When he was 13 , he produced a delicate fawn for one of his father 's customers , and it so pleased a local patron that Bourdelle was sent to nearby Toulouse to study art . <P> There he became so absorbed in his work that some of his schoolmates were under the impression that he was a mute . Bourdelle went on to the tradition-bound Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris ( which he quit in disgust after six months ) , finally landed in the studio of Rodin . The great man admired his young assistant from the start , but in spite of his affection for the master , Bourdelle never considered himself a Rodin disciple . <P> Any Mood He Chose . Rodin was essentially a modeler ; Bourdelle constructed his figures as if they were architecture . His inspiration came from many times and many places-from the early Greeks , the Assyrians , from medieval church sculpture , from " all my memory of the songs of the masters , of innumerable architectures .

Whether turning out monuments or figures a few inches high , he could produce any mood he chose . In his 21 studies of Beethoven , he distorted and exaggerated to reveal violence , sadness or ecstasy . In his Madame Roussel with Hat , the mood is elegantly casual , and few sculptures possess such an air of sweet repose as his Sculptress Resting , which is also a portrait of his wife . <P> Madame Bourdelle , now 79 , still devotes her life to her husband , who died 32 years ago . She recalls how he would get up at 4 in the morning to plunge into his work , how he would almost never accompany his friends to the cafs ( " I get drunk another way , " he would say ) , and how she would not let him out of the house with more than 20 francs in his pocket because he was forever giving money away to the poor . " He made himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The man was at least as great as his works , and there is no greater compliment . "
