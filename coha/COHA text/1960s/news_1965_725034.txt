txt United Nations , N.Y . Moscow 's reply to American overtures before the United Nations General Assembly has been to give them a welcome more sweet than sour and to extend its own overtures to the nonaligned world of Africa , Asia , and Latin America . Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei A. Gromyko nevertheless made considerable capital of what he called American " interventionism " around the world in his speech Friday . He sought to picture United States " intervention " in Vietnam and the Dominican Republic as representing a threat to all small , newly independent nations . And he asked them to join , therefore , in Assembly passage of a new Soviet " declaration " on noninterference in internal affairs . Mr. Gromyko also asked the Assembly to pass as an " urgent " matter a draft treaty on halting the spread of nuclear weapons . Warm response He thus agreed with American Ambassador Arthur J. Goldberg 's speech Thursday on the extreme urgency of preventing the increase of atom-bomb owners . Despite differences between Moscow and Washington 's view , Ambassador Goldberg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuclear weapons . He also said that if the Soviet Union really meant what it said about noninterference in internal affairs , Washington would be happy to agree . He pointed out that the United States had made a similar proposal in 1949 . But Mr. Gromyko 's terms and the American proposals are still different . The Soviet Foreign Minister said the American plan tabled recently at Geneva contained a " tiny crack through which will pass unobstructed . . . a whole multilateral fleet equipped with hundreds of nuclear-tipped missiles . " . Subdued tone His own draft was designed to prevent transfer of such weapons , even indirectly , to West German forces . Specialists in " Gromykology " noted that his references to " revenge-seeking " West Germany seemed unusually mild and brief . His lengthy prosecution against American " aggression " in Vietnam was vigorous , as expected . But it , like Ambassador Gold-berg 's references to Vietnam , contained nothing new . His speech as a whole was more subdued than usual . Mr. Gromyko spoke out twice on behalf of Communist China 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessity of including Peking in world disarmament moves , once on China 's right to be seated at the UN . But the total effect of his speech was that of warning the smaller powers against interference and " diktat " of both Washington and Peking . He inferred that only with the Soviet Union // Andrei A. Gromyko . . . urges passage of new Soviet ' declaration ' of nonintervention in internal affairs . * Gromyko decries A-weapon spread // could the " third world " expect fair and friendly relations . " Diktat " has , in fact , become a popular Soviet term of condemnation for both China and certain American actions . Soviet party leader Leonid I. Brezhnev recently applied it to Chinese interference in the India-Pakistan war . He virtually called Peking an imperialist power , using " foreign influence and diktat . " Mr. Gromyko echoed this , saying that " third parties would take advantages for themselves . . . would weaken India and Pakistan and make them prone to foreign influence and diktat . " He thus seemed to equate Peking with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of using " marines . . . indeed all the available methods of pressure and diktat " against the Dominican and other peoples . The draft declaration on noninterference submitted by the Soviet leader was shrewdly calculated to win widf support . Most of its sections are so generalized , so innocuous , so close to the spirit of the UN Charter as to be widely acceptable . Noninterference is , after all , a proclaimed tenet of the Afro-Asian world and still a sacred word in Latin-American affairs . But one paragraph " resolutely demanding an immediate end to and prevention of future action constituting armed or any other interference in the internal affairs of states ... " would seem to run afoul of President Johnson 's reported statement that if he had the Dominican crisis to do over again he would hit harder and faster than before . Wooing of the smaller nations was woven through the entire speech . There were frequent references to the spirit of the " Bandung , Belgrade . and Cairo conferences , " to the glacial retreat of colonialism , to unfair terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world disarmament conference . Despite this wooing , Mr. Gromyko 's view of the world was not likely to be much better received by the nonaligned nations than was Mr. Goldberg 's view of the day before . The nations caught between remained skeptical of the giants ' good intentions .
