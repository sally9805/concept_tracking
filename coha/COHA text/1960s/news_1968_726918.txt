txt The only thing that seems worse than staying in Hue is trying to leave it .. With the skies above the battle-scarred city still overcast , helicopters whir in only sporadically , and then just to evacuate critically wounded soldiers . The last truck convoy that : tried to reach Hue to bring in supplies and take out American civilian refugees was ambushed . Twenty Marines from the convoy were killed , 39 were wounded , and the convoy lost two armored vehicles , seven trucks , a jeep and a trailer before turning back . Two days ago , desperate to leave the booming guns in Hue , foreign refugees formed around the boat landing to seek passage on one of the Navy landing craft that still ply the Huong River , bringing supplies to the marines who are fighting against Vietcong and North Vietnamese battalions . Navy crewmen warned the refugees that it might be safer for them to remain/ in the American compound in the city . The compound has high walls , bunkers and sturdy concrete buildings to minimize the danger of mortar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other hand , is unprotected . But more than 50 refugees . plus newsmen and wounded marines , gathered there to wait in the rain for a landing craft to clear her decks of 150 ; tons of ammunition . An enemy . mortar crew fired at the landing . A Filipi- // no mother , the wife of an ad-1 vlser to the South Vietnamese Government gathered up her 5-year-old son and jumped behind a crate of C rations . " We 've been through so much these last nine days , " she said ' in a low voice , " it would n't seem fair if something happened to my son now . " " The only thing we can do now is hope the bastards are lousy shots , " one wounded marine said to another as he leaned against a packing easel and puffed casually on a ciga- ' rette . " There ai n't no place to hide . " The mortar men were lousy shots . Two shells fell in the river , kicking up small geysers of water , A third one hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the waiting passengers . While The shells were falling , the marines kept working , driving onto the landing craft with fork-lifts , picking up crates and hauling them ashore . When the last crate was hauled from the craft , the passengers rushed aboard . The women , children and the stretcher cases were taken below the main deck . The others , including wounded marines who could still walk , squatted on the deck in the rain . it was a strange cargo . There were two priests , who had been , held , captive by the Vietcong ; the , bodies of six marines in green plastic bags and a group of teachers who had found themselves trapped for nine days in Hue while artillery and mortars boomed around them . There were also three Canadians , ; three Poles and six In-dians , , representatives of the International Control Commission who were trying to work ' for peace amid war , and South Vietnamese physicians who were searched carefully by the ship 's crewmen on the alert for ; explosive charges . " If ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them ready , " one crewman told the passengers . " It will be a miracle if we do n't have to use them . " There was no miracle . Ten minutes out of Flue , Vietcong troops ran along the river bank firing rifles and rockets at the lumbering landing craft . The wounded marines rushed to the ship 's railings , firing steadily . Pfc . Calvin Reigle , an 18-year-old marine from Buffalo , tried to shoot but could not pull the trigger of his rifle . He gave it to another marine , who could shoot despite bandaged fingers . Bright red tracer bullets zipped over the cabin of the landing craft . A rocket shell struck a river patrol boat that had come along for protection . One of the neutral workers of the International Control Commission crouched low on the deck and said , " Is this boat moving at all ? " Scotch Given to Marines A half hour later , when the shooting had subsided , , one of the Canadians reached under his coat , pulled out a bottle of Ambassador @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They emptied it in four minutes : The Canadian passed around another bottle , then another , as the landing craft lumbered out of the Huong and into the 10-foot swells of the South China Sea . A Pole lurched over to the Canadian and ? aSked whether he had any seasickness pills . The Canadian said no . The Pole made his way to the ship 's railing and hung his head ' over the , side . One man on the deck turned to a newsman and grinned . " I could 've given him some pills , " he said , " but let thim suffer . He 's pulling for the other side . " At . 11:15 P.M. , seven hours after the 57-mile voyage had begun , the landing craft pulled into Danang . The Filipino woman lifted her son onto the wharf , hugged him and laughed . " We 're here ! " she kept saying . " We 're here ! "                    @
