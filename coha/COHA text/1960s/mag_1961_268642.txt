Daughter of Silence , by Morris L. West , produces a phantasmagorical sensation , like being imprisoned in a dream that is vivid in detail but totally opaque in substance . In the dream , the playgoer finds himself in the square of an Italian town framed in time-mellowed stone arches . A brassy mayor is making an election speech . After he finishes , a girl ( Janet Margolin ) with a pale , troubled face slips a revolver from her purse and shoots him dead . The dream shifts . Two men and a woman are in a conservatory with a grand piano . They look unhappy . One man ( Emlyn Williams ) is urbane and silver-bearded ; he is a bad father . The younger man ( Rip Torn ) is tense ; he is a bad husband . The woman ( Joanne Linville ) is bitter ; she is a bad daughter to Williams and a bad wife to Torn . During piano breaks , the three revile one another and occasionally try to purple-patch things up : " Forgive me if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe that I love you . " ( The secret of why they have made such a mess of things remains safe with the playwright . ) <P> The dream shifts again . The murderess is on trial . It develops that during World War II , when the girl was eight , she saw her mother raped and murdered by the mayor , who was then a partisan . It rankled , or to put it in the language of the play , a " trauma " led to an " obsession . " Be that as it may , argues the prosecutor , the girl is guilty , and the law is order and must be maintained . The girl 's lawyer ( Torn ) argues that justice should be tempered with mercy . This creates quite a stir in the courtroom , and the black-robed judges nod gravely , apparently never having heard the idea before . Playgoers who can not wake from the dream at this point and focus on an exit sign deserve this melodrama 's remaining surprises . <P> Since Daughter of Silence is coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Novelist-Playwright West ( The Devil 's Advocate ) had closed the motivational gaps of the play in the pages of the book . Not so . The novel simply contains more characters , more scenery , and more murky rhetoric . Director Vincent J. Donehue 's idea of giving the play stature is to have the actors speak in capital letters . This helps to make 18-year-old Janet Margolin 's Broadway debut doubly attractive , since she has the great good luck of having little or nothing to say .
