txt " There is no doubt about the upsurge . The only question is whether it 's enough . " That is the way Terry Sanford , the national chairman of Citizens for Humphrey-Musicie , sees the obvious rise in the political fortunes of the Democratic national . ticket in recent weeks  --  a rise confirmed today by a significant gain in the Gallup Poll . The Vice President has narrowed the gap between himself and Richard M. Nixon from 12 points to eight points over the previous Gallup Poll , taken Oct. 3-12 . Page 68 . Mr. Sanford 's view is widely shared among Humphrey men , whose early October mood of snappish gloom has noticeably brightened . It is not that these Democrats are confident , but that now they can see the possibility , however remote , of an upset victory . Psychological Lift That possibility will seem even more real sometime in the coming week , when Senator Eugene J. McCarthy endorses the Humphrey candidacy . When and where he will do so remain uncertain , but Mr. McCarthy has left little doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the Democratic fold at an increasing pace  --  one reason for the " upsurge " ? the number of votes to be " swung " by Mr. McCarthy 's action may not be tremendous . But it ought to bring a psychological lift to Democratic workers and voters on the eve of the election . This could lend credence to the idea of an upset , an idea that now appears likely to dominate the last 10 days of the 1968 Presidential campaign : Even - Mr . Nixon gives evidence of this as he sharpens his attacks on Mr. Humphrey . Some Democrats even think Mr Nixon 's abandonment of his // above-the-battle posture means that he Is beginning to " run scared . " But no other hint of Republican alarm comes out of the smooth Nixon campaign , nor is there as yet real cause for worry in his position in the national polls ? which remains steady . Mr. Humphrey 's gains have been mostly at the expense of the third-party candidate , George C. Wallace . Yet the signs of " upsurge " are all about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political money on Mr. Sanford 's desk ? $77,000 in one recent delivery of small contributions that came in after Mr. Humphrey 's hour of primetime television last Sunday . That program rated 17 million adult viewers . More significant was the fact that only a small percentage tuned out the Vice President before the end of the show . Well Up In Polls Mr. Humphrey not only is well up in the polls from his recent low points but Dr. George Gallup and Louis Harris have also been in such sharp statistical disagreement ? with Mr. Harris picturing a closer race  --  that Democrats are encouraged in the belief that in this year 's three-way campaign ; polling techniques may be less reliable than usual . If that is the case , they reason , maybe Mr. Humphrey was never so badly off as was thought . Moreover , they point out to themselves , even if their candidate is running a point behind Mr. Nixon in reliable polls in Minnesota and Michigan , two states a Democratic liberal named Hubert Humphrey ought normally to win in a walk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing as even , and therefore the Vice President has by no means lost these states , and others in similar case . Mr. Humphrey 's crowds are up , and at least the appearance of party unity has been achieved in Texas and California , and his associates say this is plainly reflected in the candidate 's private mood . The Vice President , in this view , has scored a big point on the debate issue , particularly since he paid for an hourlong appearance on television that Mr. Nixon refused to join , and since Mr. Wallace agreed to relinquish his right to appear with the two major-party candidates . Hope For Paris Break The mood of " upsurge " has also been affected by the recent renewal of hope for a decisive break in the Paris negotiations ; if this should result in a halt to the bombing of North Vietnam and an accompanying demonstration of progress in the talks , Humphreyites are sure it will help their man . Even if the present mood of uncertain hope can be maintained , they think , the Vietnam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bombhalt prospects are completely dashed on the eve of election could Mr. Humphrey be hurt . But even if the " upsurge " is demonstrable , as Mr. Sanford asked , is it enough ? The arithmetic of the election does not support much optimism . High Democratic sources do not dispute , even privately , that arithmetic , which is as follows : The eight major electoralvote states are New York ( 43 ) , California ( 40 ) , Pennsylvania ( 29 ) , Ohio ( 26 ) , Illinois ( 26 ) , Texas ( 25 ) , Michigan ( 21 ) , and New Jersey ( 17 ) . Of these , Illinois is considered almost certainly lost to the Vice President . The seven others total only 201 electoral votes , against the majority of 270 needed for election . Therefore , if Mr. Humphrey carried all the Big Eight except Illinois , he would still face a major task in finding 69 more I electoral votes from states like Minnesota ( 10 ) and Maryland ( 10 ) , which he may carry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7 ) and the District of Columbia ( 3 ) , which he almost certainly will carry . Decline in Midwest Getting those 69 votes will not be easy , since Dr. Gallup shows that , upsurge or no upsurge , Mr. Humphrey has lost strength in the Midwest since Sept. 15 , gained only minimally in the Far West , and made a really strong gain ? seven points  --  only in the Eastern Seaboard states . Mr. Humphrey has closed the gap somewhat in the South , but still runs generally behind both Mr. Nixon , by a narrow margin , and Mr. Wallace , by a larger margin , in that region . The situation in the Border states is still cloudy ; in North Carolina , for instance , one recent poll shows that all three candidates have lost strength , and that the pool of undecided voters is about as large as the support for any of the three . But today 's national Gallup Poll , in which Mr. Humphrey gained five points while Mr. Wallace lost five , suggests that the Vice President is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third-party candidate . So the sharp rise . in " undecided " voters in the Border states gives some Democrats hope that many of these , too , will ultimately decide for Mr. Humphrey . But even if in this mixed bag of regional prospects Mr. Humphrey could find 69 electoral votes , he would still have to carry seven of the Big Eight ? all save Illinois . This would be a remarkable sweep , almost too much to hope for . And although Democrats are buoyed by a better situation than they had expected in Texas , their prospects in California remain dim . Coast Rally Canceled Last night , for instance , Mr. Humphrey canceled a rally first scheduled for San Francisco , then for Oakland , and campaigned instead in Nevada ( 3 electoral votes ) . San Francisco sources said a combination of planned peace demonstrations and small turnouts of Democrats were responsible for the cancellations in a normally Democratic urban area . If Mr. Humphrey loses California , his candidacy might be hopeless ; certainly , if he loses California and any other one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recover so many electoral votes elsewhere . Yet , in each of these seven states , his situation is at best precarious , and - he could lose ip any or all of them . It is for these reasons that the Humphrey upsurge , real as it appears to be , and:ominous as it may seem to Mr. Nixon , has brought no real confidence to Mr. Humphrey 's campaign . " You have to ask where we started from , " one high  --  Democratic strategist said : - " Where were we three weeks ago ? We were on the wrong side of the Vietnam and law and order issues . We had a totally- deteriorated party organization . We had the Chicago convention to live down . And all . : ( 51. that meant we had a total lack of funds to run a campaign . " From that low point and dating approximately from his speech on Vietnam in Salt Lake City on Sept. 30 , Mr. Humphrey has come charging back into the middle of the race . To win , he will have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
