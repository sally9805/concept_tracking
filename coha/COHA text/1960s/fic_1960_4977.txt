Illustration THE DOPE on Mars By JACK SHARKEY Somebody had to get the human angle on this trip ... but what was humane about sending me ? Illustrated by WOOD My agent was the one who got me the job of going along to write up the first trip to Mars . He was always getting me things like that  --  appearances on TV shows , or mentions in writers ' magazines . If he did n't sell much of my stuff , at least he sold me . " It 'll be the biggest break a writer ever got , " he told me , two days before blastoff . " Oh , sure there 'll be scientific reports on the trip , but the public does n't want them ; they want the human slant on things . " " But , Louie , " I said weakly , " I 'll probably be locked up for the whole trip . If there are fights or accidents , they wo n't tell me about them . " " Nonsense , " said Louie , sipping carefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be just like the public going along vicariously . They 'll identify with you . " " But , Louie , " I said , wiping the dampness from my palms on the knees of my trousers as I sat there , " how 'll I go about it ? A story ? An article ? A you-are-there type of report ? What ? " Louie shrugged . " So keep a diary . It 'll be more intimate , like . " " But what if nothing happens ? " I insisted hopelessly . Louie smiled . " So you fake it . " I got up from the chair in his office and stepped to the door . " That 's dishonest , " I pointed out . " Creative is the word , " Louie said . So I went on the first trip to Mars . And I kept a diary . This is it . And it is honest . Honest it is. * * * * * October 1 , 1960 They picked the launching date from the March , 1959 , New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time for launching . Trip time is supposed to take 260 days ( that 's one way ) , so we 're aimed toward where Mars will be ( had better be , or else ) . There are five of us on board . A pilot , co-pilot , navigator and biochemist . And , of course , me . I 've met all but the pilot ( he 's very busy today ) , and they seem friendly enough . Dwight Kroger , the biochemist , is rather old to take the " rigors of the journey , " as he puts it , but the government had a choice between sending a green scientist who could stand the trip or an accomplished man who would probably not survive , so they picked Kroger . We 've blasted off , though , and he 's still with us . He looks a damn sight better than I feel . He 's kind of balding , and very iron-gray-haired and skinny , but his skin is tan as an Indian 's , and right now he 's telling jokes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the co-pilot ; I did n't quite catch his first name ) is scarlet-faced , barrel-chested and gives the general appearance of belonging under the spreading chestnut tree , not in a metal bullet flinging itself out into airless space . Come to think of it , who does belong where we are ? The navigator 's name is Lloyd Streeter , but I have n't seen his face yet . He has a little cubicle behind the pilot 's compartment , with all kinds of maps and rulers and things . He keeps bent low over a welded-to-the-wall ( they call it the bulkhead , for some reason or other ) table , scratching away with a ballpoint pen on the maps , and now and then calling numbers over a microphone to the pilot . His hair is red and curly , and he looks as though he 'd be tall if he ever gets to stand up . There are freckles on the backs of his hands , so I think he 's probably got them on his face , too . So far , all he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Kroger tells me that the pilot 's name is Patrick Desmond , but that I can call him Pat when I get to know him better . So far , he 's still Captain Desmond to me . I have n't the vaguest idea what he looks like . He was already on board when I got here , with my typewriter and ream of paper , so we did n't meet . My compartment is small but clean . I mean clean now . It was n't during blastoff . The inertial gravities did n't bother me so much as the gyroscopic spin they put on the ship so we have a sort of artificial gravity to hold us against the curved floor . It 's that constant whirly feeling that gets me . I get sick on merry-go-rounds , too . They 're having pork for dinner today . Not me. * * * * * October 2 , 1960 Feeling much better today . Kroger gave me a box of Dramamine pills . He says they 'll help my stomach . So far , so good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " he asked . " A little , " I admitted . " How about a game sometime ? " " Sure , " I said . " Do you have a board ? " He did n't . Lloyd went away then , but the interview was n't wasted . I learned that he is tall and does have a freckled face . Maybe we can build a chessboard . With my paper and his ballpoint pen and ruler , it should be easy . Do n't know what we 'll use for pieces , though . Jones ( I still have n't learned his first name ) has been up with the pilot all day . He passed my room on the way to the galley ( the kitchen ) for a cup of dark brown coffee ( they like it thick ) and told me that we were almost past the Moon . I asked to look , but he said not yet ; the instrument panel is Top Secret . They 'd have to cover it so I could look out the viewing screen , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still have n't met the pilot . * * * * * October 3 , 1960 Well , I 've met the pilot . He is kind of squat , with a vulturish neck and close-set jet-black eyes that make him look rather mean , but he was pleasant enough , and said I could call him Pat . I still do n't know Jones ' first name , though Pat spoke to him , and it sounded like Flants . That ca n't be right . Also , I am one of the first five men in the history of the world to see the opposite side of the Moon , with a bluish blurred crescent beyond it that Pat said was the Earth . The back of the Moon is n't much different from the front . As to the space in front of the ship , well , it 's all black with white dots in it , and none of the dots move , except in a circle that Pat says is a " torque " result from the gyroscopic spin we 're in . Actually , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep the image of space locked into place no matter how much we spin . But there 's some kind of a " drag . " I told him I hoped it did n't mean we 'd land on Mars upside down . He just stared at me . I ca n't say I was too impressed with that 16 x 19 view of outer space . It 's been done much better in the movies . There 's just no awesomeness to it , no sense of depth or immensity . It 's as impressive as a piece of velvet with salt sprinkled on it . Lloyd and I made a chessboard out of a carton . Right now we 're using buttons for men . He 's one of these fast players who do n't stop and think out their moves . And so far I have n't won a game . It looks like a long trip . * * * * * October 4 , 1960 I won a game . Lloyd mistook my queen-button for my bishop-button and left his king in jeopardy , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waste of time and he had important work to do and he went away . I went to the galley for coffee and had a talk about moss with Kroger . He said there was a good chance of lichen on Mars , and I misunderstood and said , " A good chance of liking what on Mars ? " and Kroger finished his coffee and went up front . When I got back to my compartment , Lloyd had taken away the chessboard and all his buttons . He told me later he needed it to back up a star map . Pat slept mostly all day in his compartment , and Jones sat and watched the screen revolve . There was n't much to do , so I wrote a poem , sort of . Mary , Mary , quite contrary , How does your garden grow ? With Martian rime , Venusian slime , And a radioactive hoe . I showed it to Kroger . He says it may prove to be environmentally accurate , but that I should stick to prose . * * * * * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He wrote something in the ship 's log , and I saw his signature . His name is Fleance , like in " Macbeth . " He prefers to be called Jones . Pat uses his first name as a gag . Some fun . And only 255 days to go . Illustration * * * * * April 1 , 1961 I 've skipped over the last 177 days or so , because there 's nothing much new . I brought some books with me on the trip , books that I 'd always meant to read and never had the time . So now I know all about Vanity Fair , Pride and Prejudice , War and Peace , Gone with the Wind , and Babbitt . They did n't take as long as I thought they would , except for Vanity Fair . It must have been a riot when it first came out . I mean , all those sly digs at the aristocracy , with copious interpolations by Mr. Thackeray in case you did n't get it when he 'd pulled a particularly good gag . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * * * * * June 1 , 1961 Only 17 days to go . I saw Mars on the screen today . It seems to be descending from overhead , but Pat says that that 's the " torque " doing it . Actually , it 's we who are coming in sideways . We 've all grown beards , too . Pat said it was against regulations , but what the hell . We have a contest . Longest whiskers on landing gets a prize . I asked Pat what the prize was and he told me to go to hell . * * * * * June 18 , 1961 Mars has the whole screen filled . Looks like Death Valley . No sign of canals , but Pat says that 's because of the dust storm down below . It 's nice to have a " down below " again . We 're going to land , so I have to go to my bunk . It 's all foam rubber , nylon braid supports and magnesium tubing . Might as well be cement for all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far away . * * * * * June 19 , 1961 Well , we 're down . We have to wear gas masks with oxygen hook-ups . Kroger says the air is breathable , but thin , and it has too much dust in it to be any fun to inhale . He 's all for going out and looking for lichen , but Pat says he 's got to set up camp , then get instructions from Earth . So we just have to wait . The air is very cold , but the Sun is hot as hell when it hits you . The sky is a blinding pink , or maybe more of a pale fuchsia . Kroger says it 's the dust . The sand underfoot is kind of rose-colored , and not really gritty . The particles are round and smooth . No lichen so far . Kroger says maybe in the canals , if there are any canals . Lloyd wants to play chess again . Jones won the beard contest . Pat gave him a cigar he 'd smuggled on board ( no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threw it away . He does n't smoke . * * * * * June 20 , 1961 Got lost today . Pat told me not to go too far from camp , so , when I took a stroll , I made sure every so often that I could still see the rocket behind me . Walked for maybe an hour ; then the oxygen gauge got past the halfway mark , so I started back toward the rocket . After maybe ten steps , the rocket disappeared . One minute it was standing there , tall and silvery , the next instant it was gone . Turned on my radio pack and got hold of Pat . Told him what happened , and he told Kroger . Kroger said I had been following a mirage , to step back a bit . I did , and I could see the ship again . Kroger said to try and walk toward where the ship seemed to be , even when it was n't in view , and meantime they 'd come out after me in the jeep , following my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . It reappeared , disappeared , but I kept going . Finally saw the real ship , and Lloyd and Jones waving their arms at me . They were shouting through their masks , but I could n't hear them . The air is too thin to carry sound well . All at once , something gleamed in their hands , and they started shooting at me with their rifles . That 's when I heard the noise behind me . I was too scared to turn around , but finally Jones and Lloyd came running over , and I got up enough nerve to look . There was nothing there , but on the sand , paralleling mine , were footprints . At least I think they were footprints . Twice as long as mine , and three times as wide , but kind of featureless because the sand 's loose and dry . They doubled back on themselves , spaced considerably farther apart . " What was it ? " I asked Lloyd when he got to me . " Damned if I know , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think it had a tail . It was two heads taller than you . " He shuddered . " Ran off when we fired . " " Where , " said Jones , " are Pat and Kroger ? " I did n't know . I had n't seen them , nor the jeep , on my trip back . So we followed the wheel tracks for a while , and they veered off from my trail and followed another , very much like the one that had been paralleling mine when Jones and Lloyd had taken a shot at the scaly thing . " We 'd better get them on the radio , " said Jones , turning back toward the ship . There was n't anything on the radio but static . Pat and Kroger have n't come back yet , either . * * * * * June 21 , 1961 We 're not alone here . More of the scaly things have come toward the camp , but a few rifle shots send them away . They hop like kangaroos when they 're startled . Their attitudes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jones says , " Who knows what 's ' menacing ' in an alien ? " We 're going to look for Kroger and Pat today . Jones says we 'd better before another windstorm blows away the jeep tracks . Fortunately , the jeep has a leaky oil pan , so we always have the smears to follow , unless they get covered up , too . We 're taking extra oxygen , shells , and rifles . Food , too , of course . And we 're locking up the ship . * * * * * It 's later , now . We found the jeep , but no Kroger or Pat . Lots of those big tracks nearby . We 're taking the jeep to follow the aliens ' tracks . There 's some moss around here , on reddish brown rocks that stick up through the sand , just on the shady side , though . Kroger must be happy to have found his lichen . The trail ended at the brink of a deep crevice in the ground . Seems to be an earthquake-type split @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the far edge like pink silk cataracts . The bottom is in the shade and ca n't be seen . The crack seems to extend to our left and right as far as we can look . There looks like a trail down the inside of the crevice , but the Sun 's setting , so we 're waiting till tomorrow to go down . Going down was Jones ' idea , not mine . * * * * * June 22 , 1961 Well , we 're at the bottom , and there 's water here , a shallow stream about thirty feet wide that runs along the center of the canal ( we 've decided we 're in a canal ) . No sign of Pat or Kroger yet , but the sand here is hard-packed and damp , and there are normal-size footprints mingled with the alien ones , sharp and clear . The aliens seem to have six or seven toes . It varies from print to print . And they 're barefoot , too , or else they have the damnedest-looking shoes in creation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annoying , but it 's sandless ( shower-wise ) near the stream , so we 're following the footprints along the bank . Also , the air 's better down here . Still thin , but not so bad as on the surface . We 're going without masks to save oxygen for the return trip ( Jones assures me there 'll be a return trip ) , and the air 's only a little bit sandy , but handkerchiefs over nose and mouth solve this . We look like desperadoes , what with the rifles and covered faces . I said as much to Lloyd and he told me to shut up . Moss all over the cliff walls . Swell luck for Kroger. * * * * * We 've found Kroger and Pat , with the help of the aliens . Or maybe I should call them the Martians . Either way , it 's better than what Jones calls them . They took away our rifles and brought us right to Kroger and Pat , without our even asking . Jones is mad at the way they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them ( a group of maybe ten , huddling behind a boulder in ambush ) , he fired , but the shots either bounced off their scales or stuck in their thick hides . Anyway , they took the rifles away and threw them into the stream , and picked us all up and took us into a hole in the cliff wall . The hole went on practically forever , but it did n't get dark . Kroger tells me that there are phosphorescent bacteria living in the mold on the walls . The air has a fresh-dug-grave smell , but it 's richer in oxygen than even at the stream . We 're in a small cave that is just off a bigger cave where lots of tunnels come together . I ca n't remember which one we came in through , and neither can anyone else . Jones asked me what the hell I kept writing in the diary for , did I want to make it a gift to Martian archeologists ? But I said where there 's life there 's hope , and now he wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lichen I 'd seen , but he just said a short and unscientific word and went to sleep . There 's a Martian guarding the entrance to our cave . I do n't know what they intend to do with us . Feed us , I hope . So far , they 've just left us here , and we 're out of rations . Kroger tried talking to the guard once , but he ( or it ) made a whistling kind of sound and flashed a mouthful of teeth . Kroger says the teeth are in multiple rows , like a tiger shark 's . I 'd rather he had n't told me. * * * * * June 23 , 1961 , I think We 're either in a docket or a zoo . I ca n't tell which . There 's a rather square platform surrounded on all four sides by running water , maybe twenty feet across , and we 're on it . Martians keep coming to the far edge of the water and looking at us and whistling at each other . A little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger Martian whistled like crazy and dragged it away . " Water must be dangerous to them , " said Kroger . " We shoulda brought water pistols , " Jones muttered . Pat said maybe we can swim to safety . Kroger told Pat he was crazy , that the little island we 're on here underground is bordered by a fast river that goes into the planet . We 'd end up drowned in some grotto in the heart of the planet , says Kroger . " What the hell , " says Pat , " it 's better than starving . " It is not . * * * * * June 24 , 1961 , probably I 'm hungry . So is everybody else . Right now I could eat a dinner raw , in a centrifuge , and keep it down . A Martian threw a stone at Jones today , and Jones threw one back at him and broke off a couple of scales . The Martian whistled furiously and went away . When the crowd thinned out , same as it did yesterday ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kroger talked Lloyd into swimming across the river and getting the red scales . Lloyd started at the upstream part of the current , and was about a hundred yards below this underground island before he made the far side . Sure is a swift current . But he got the scales , walked very far upstream of us , and swam back with them . The stream sides are steep , like in a fjord , and we had to lift him out of the swirling cold water , with the scales gripped in his fist . Or what was left of the scales . They had melted down in the water and left his hand all sticky . Kroger took the gummy things , studied them in the uncertain light , then tasted them and grinned . The Martians are made of sugar . * * * * * Later , same day . Kroger said that the Martian metabolism must be like Terran ( Earth-type ) metabolism , only with no pancreas to make insulin . They store their energy on the outside of their bodies , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closely and seen that they have long rubbery tubes for tongues , and that they now and then suck up water from the stream while they 're watching us , being careful not to get their lips ( all sugar , of course ) wet . He guesses that their " blood " must be almost pure water , and that it washes away ( from the inside , of course ) the sugar they need for energy . I asked him where the sugar came from , and he said probably their bodies isolated carbon from something ( he thought it might be the moss ) and combined it with the hydrogen and oxygen in the water ( even I knew the formula for water ) to make sugar , a common carbohydrate . Like plants , on Earth , he said . Except , instead of using special cells on leaves to form carbohydrates with the help of sunpower , as Earth plants do in photosynthesis ( Kroger spelled that word for me ) , they used the shape of the scales like prisms , to isolate the spectra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I do n't get it , " I said politely , when he 'd finished his spiel . " Simple , " he said , as though he were addressing me by name . " They have a twofold reason to fear water . One : by complete solvency in that medium , they lose all energy and die . Two : even partial sprinkling alters the shape of the scales , and they are unable to use sunpower to form more sugar , and still die , if a bit slower . " " Oh , " I said , taking it down verbatim . " So now what do we do ? " " We remove our boots , " said Kroger , sitting on the ground and doing so , " and then we cross this stream , fill the boots with water , and spray our way to freedom . " " Which tunnel do we take ? " asked Pat , his eyes aglow at the thought of escape . Kroger shrugged . " We 'll have to chance taking any that seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow it back and start again . " " I du n no , " said Jones . " Remember those teeth of theirs . They must be for biting something more substantial than moss , Kroger . " " We 'll risk it , " said Pat . " It 's better to go down fighting than to die of starvation . " The hell it is. * * * * * June 24 , 1961 , for sure The Martians have coal mines . That 's what they use those teeth for . We passed through one and surprised a lot of them chewing gritty hunks of anthracite out of the walls . They came running at us , whistling with those tubelike tongues , and drooling dry coal dust , but Pat swung one of his boots in an arc that splashed all over the ground in front of them , and they turned tail ( literally ) and clattered off down another tunnel , sounding like a locomotive whistle gone berserk . We made the surface in another hour , back in the canal , and were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the place above which the jeep still waited . Jones got the rifles out of the stream ( the Martians had probably thought they were beyond recovery there ) and we found the jeep . It was nearly buried in sand , but we got it cleaned off and running , and got back to the ship quickly . First thing we did on arriving was to break out the stores and have a celebration feast just outside the door of the ship . It was pork again , and I got sick . * * * * * June 25 , 1961 We 're going back . Pat says that a week is all we were allowed to stay and that it 's urgent to return and tell what we 've learned about Mars ( we know there are Martians , and they 're made of sugar ) . " Why , " I said , " ca n't we just tell it on the radio ? " " Because , " said Pat , " if we tell them now , by the time we get back we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lucky and get a parade . " " Maybe even money , " said Kroger , whose mind was n't always on science . " But they 'll ask why we did n't radio the info , sir , " said Jones uneasily . " The radio , " said Pat , nodding to Lloyd , " was unfortunately broken shortly after landing . " Lloyd blinked , then nodded back and walked around the rocket . I heard a crunching sound and the shattering of glass , not unlike the noise made when one drives a rifle butt through a radio . Well , it 's time for takeoff. * * * * * This time it was n't so bad . I thought I was getting my space-legs , but Pat says there 's less gravity on Mars , so escape velocity did n't have to be so fast , hence a smoother ( relatively ) trip on our shock-absorbing bunks . Lloyd wants to play chess again . I 'll be careful not to win this time . However , if I do n't win , maybe this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is busy in his cramped lab space trying to classify the little moss he was able to gather , and Jones and Pat are up front watching the white specks revolve on that black velvet again . Guess I 'll take a nap . * * * * * June 26 , 1961 Hell 's bells . Kroger says there are two baby Martians loose on board ship . Pat told him he was nuts , but there are certain signs he 's right . Like the missing charcoal in the **29;136;TOOLONG ( AFAR ) system . And the water gauges are going down . But the clincher is those two sugar crystals Lloyd had grabbed up when we were in that zoo . They 're gone . Pat has declared a state of emergency . Quick thinking , that 's Pat . Lloyd , before he remembered and turned scarlet , suggested we radio Earth for instructions . We ca n't . Here we are , somewhere in a void headed for Earth , with enough air and water left for maybe three days  --  if the Martians do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning something , maybe , about Martian reproductive processes . When he told Pat , Pat put it to a vote whether or not to jettison Kroger through the airlock . However , it was decided that responsibility was pretty well divided . Lloyd had gotten the crystals , Kroger had only studied them , and Jones had brought them aboard . So Kroger stays , but meanwhile the air is getting worse . Pat suggested Kroger put us all into a state of suspended animation till landing time , eight months away . Kroger said , " How ? " * * * * * June 27 , 1961 Air is foul and I 'm very thirsty . Kroger says that at least  --  when the Martians get bigger  --  they 'll have to show themselves . Pat says what do we do then ? We ca n't afford the water we need to melt them down . Besides , the melted crystals might all turn into little Martians . Jones says he 'll go down spitting . Pat says why not dismantle interior of rocket to find out where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you dismantle riveted metal plates ? * * * * * June 28 , 1961 The AFAR system is no more and the water gauges are still dropping . Kroger suggests baking bread , then slicing it , then toasting it till it turns to carbon , and we can use the carbon in the AFAR system . We 'll have to try it , I guess . * * * * * The Martians ate the bread . Jones came forward to tell us the loaves were cooling , and when he got back they were gone . However , he did find a few of the red crystals on the galley deck ( floor ) . They 're good-sized crystals , too . Which means so are the Martians . Kroger says the Martians must be intelligent , otherwise they could n't have guessed at the carbohydrates present in the bread after a lifelong diet of anthracite . Pat says let 's jettison Kroger . This time the vote went against Kroger , but he got a last-minute reprieve by suggesting the crystals be pulverized and mixed with sulphuric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly hope so . So does Kroger. * * * * * Brief reprieve for us . The acid-sugar combination not only produces carbon but water vapor , and the gauge has gone up a notch . That means that we have a quart of water in the tanks for drinking . However , the air 's a bit better , and we voted to let Kroger stay inside the rocket . Meantime , we have to catch those Martians. * * * * * June 29 , 1961 Worse and worse . Lloyd caught one of the Martians in the firing chamber . We had to flood the chamber with acid to subdue the creature , which carbonized nicely . So now we have plenty of air and water again , but besides having another Martian still on the loose , we now do n't have enough acid left in the fuel tanks to make a landing . Pat says at least our vector will carry us to Earth and we can die on our home planet , which is better than perishing in space . The hell it is. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in sight . The other Martian is still with us . He 's where we ca n't get at him without blow-torches , but he ca n't get at the carbon in the AFAR system , either , which is a help . However , his tail is prehensile , and now and then it snakes out through an air duct and yanks food right off the table from under our noses . Kroger says watch out . We are made of carbohydrates , too . I 'd rather not have known . * * * * * March 4 , 1962 Earth fills the screen in the control room . Pat says if we 're lucky , he might be able to use the bit of fuel we have left to set us in a descending spiral into one of the oceans . The rocket is tighter than a submarine , he insists , and it will float till we 're rescued , if the plates do n't crack under the impact . We all agreed to try it . Not that we thought it had a good chance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . * * * * * I guess you know the rest of the story , about how that destroyer spotted us and got us and my diary aboard , and towed the rocket to San Francisco . News of the " captured Martian " leaked out , and we all became nine-day wonders until the dismantling of the rocket . Kroger says he must have dissolved in the water , and wonders what that would do . There are about a thousand of those crystal-scales on a Martian . So last week we found out , when those red-scaled things began clambering out of the sea on every coastal region on Earth . Kroger tried to explain to me about salinity osmosis and hydrostatic pressure and crystalline life , but in no time at all he lost me . The point is , bullets wo n't stop these things , and wherever a crystal falls , a new Martian springs up in a few weeks . It looks like the five of us have abetted an invasion from Mars . Needless to say , we 're no longer heroes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week . Jones was picked up attacking a candy factory yesterday , and Kroger and I were allowed to sign on for the flight to Venus scheduled within the next few days  --  because of our experience . Kroger says there 's only enough fuel for a one-way trip . I do n't care . I 've always wanted to travel with the President .  --  JACK SHARKEY
