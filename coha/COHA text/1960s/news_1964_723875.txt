" This sanctified piety is repulsive ! " retorted Mr. Gelb . " It is n't appropriate for Mr. Scotti to deliver lectures here . " Supreme Court Justice Joseph A. Sarafite , presiding , counseled both lawyers gently to stop squabbling . Mr. Gelb took only five minutes for his opeing address . He said that Mr. Scotti 's lengthy remarks " have not helped you determine where the truth is .
