On a rolling 120 acres outside Buffalo last week , engineers started planning the construction of a $12.5 million apartment hotel and a cluster of small cottages , to be called Rockledge . It will have a pitch-and-putt golf course , lawn bowling , shuffleboard , roof garden , sun deck and an infirmary offering 24-hr , medical service . What sets Rockledge apart from other hotel projects is that it is designed to house only retired people-at a profit . Prices will start at $8,000 to buy a living room-bedroom apartment , plus a $112.50-per-person monthly charge for meals and maintenance . The builders of Rockledge are so enthusiastic about the vast new market to house the elderly that they plan to spend another $87.5 million to build similar projects in 14 other states . <P> Exploding Market . The number of private projects to provide housing for the elderly is growing fast ; Social Security payments and company pension plans make it possible for more and more of the retired to live in such developments . One-fourth of the 15.5 million U.S. citizens over age 65 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pensions . Their ranks will swell as pension plans expand and the number of those over 65 soars to 20 million by 1970 . Recognizing the possibilities , the Federal Housing Administration has given the housing projects a boost ; it guarantees up to 90% of mortgages on profit-making retirement homes . <P> With this impetus , hotels for oldsters are springing up from New York to Florida . There is Springvale-on-the-Hudson , with 160 terraced garden apartments , in Westchester County , N.Y. , now being expanded to 375 units to keep up with demand . Rents start at $89.50 a month . The North Cape May ( NJ . ) Homes , a development of houses in a resort area , is selling at prices up to $11,000 . Orange Gardens , in Kissimmee , Fla. , has 215 houses at prices up to $12,000 . <P> A Quicker Solution . In some areas , a quicker solution is being used : the conversion of old hotels . Oldsters like them because they are conveniently near bustling business districts . Two old hotel chains-the MacArthur with 15 hotels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chain throughout the South and the Midwest , called Senior Citizens Hotels Inc . They are converting several floors of each hotel for retirement living . There is a recreation room and kitchen , ramps instead of stairways where possible . Rents range from $35 a month for a room without meals to $125 for a bath and three meals , supervised by a dietitian to make certain that meals are wholesome for oldsters . Says Senior Citizens ' originator , Charles Little : " An attractive retirement hotel sells the children whose consciences might otherwise bother them when they move the old folks out of their homes .
