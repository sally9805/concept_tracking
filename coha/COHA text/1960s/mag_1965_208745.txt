In the jungle battlefields of Viet Nam , knowing the Vietnamese language may be as important to a U.S. soldier as his accuracy in firing an M-14 . Supplying American military advisers there with the right words is fast becoming the primary mission of what its graduates call " Lingo Tech " : the West Coast Branch of the Defense Language Institute , located at the Army 's historic Presidio in Monterey , Calif . <P> Operated for all the services by the Army Department , the institute had its modest beginnings in 1941 as an Army intelligence course in Japanese , now has five schools across the country . Of these , the oldest and by far the largest is the branch at Monterey , which trains up to 2,500 military personnel a year in 27 languages and 33 dialects , in courses that range from a twelve-week quickie in Vietnamese to a full 47 weeks in Chinese , Russian , Arabic and some 13 other languages . <P> Do n't Drop a Pencil . The language training at Monterey is the most intense in the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pencil in class and take time to pick it up , you 've lost an hour 's material . " Classes run for six hours a day five days a week , interrupted by two two-week vacations throughout the year . Students are expected to spend three hours or more daily on homework . <P> As at Berlitz , students are totally immersed in the language from the moment they enter class . No English is spoken , and students are assigned native pseudonyms by which they are known throughout the course . Starting first with the mastery of sound , they mimic every word of their instructors-most of them natives of the country whose language they teach . Gradually , students move up from sounds to basic grammar to sentences to conversation and writing . To supplement class work , they have textbooks written by Monterey 's 381-man faculty , individual tape recorders , closed-circuit television films in the institute 's elaborate language lab . <P> " Our real mission , " says Dr. Erwin Gordon , an academic adviser to the institute , " is communication , not vocabulary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of local history and culture , often take time out to sample the native cuisine-if available-in San Francisco restaurants . To test a student 's practical command of his language , Monterey has set up facsimile banks , post offices and stores where he is forced to negotiate a bank loan , mail home a package or shop for his dinner-all without lapsing into English . <P> Adviros in Battle . Students of the institute have an additional exercise unavailable in other language schools : mock warfare is enacted on two sides of a partition , with the student " adviros " ( advisers ) talking back and forth on the telephone . At the end of the battle , students compare notes to see if they were successfully getting the messages across . By the time a student laughs at the same thing a native laughs at , Gordon figures , he is approaching mastery of the language . For Americans , gaining this kind of mastery in Vietnamese is especially hard .
