The Girl Who Came to Supper will make the average theatrical gourmet yearn for the company of the late Monty Woolley . Even in his grave , George S. Kaufman could think up funnier lines than Harry Kurnitz has been able to confect for this musical adaptation of Terence Rattigan 's The Sleeping Prince .

This part of Broadway can legitimately be declared a disaster area , except for those involuntary rescue squads , the theater parties , which will keep the show green for a while with money . <P> Supper turns the musical-comedy clock back to operetta , costumed in My Fair Lady style and set in London , where a royal delegation has arrived from the mythical kingdom of Carpathia for the coronation of George V. Jos Ferrer is a middle-aging , sleep-around prince , though he acts more like a wooden horse . His fancy , his fury , and his fate is to seduce a visiting American showgirl ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Between Ferrer 's dead-pained expression and Henderson 's unvaryingly cheery smile , the pair manage to drive away all thoughts of sex and romance . <P> There is one authentic yawn stifler in Supper , an inspired import from the British music halls named Tessie O'Shea . The O'Shea is fat and sassy , swoops about like a bat on a binge , and pitches irresistibly into a medley of cockney nostalgia , as in Do n't Take Our Charlie for the Army . Tessie O'Shea has no relation whatever to the plot of The Girl Who Came to Supper . Lucky lady .
