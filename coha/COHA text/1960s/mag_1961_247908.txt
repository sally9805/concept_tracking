Said Nikita Khrushchev to U.S. Ambassador Llewellyn Thompson at a special conference last week in the Kremlin : " If we all keep our heads and do nothing provocative , we can find a way out of our problems in Laos . " For 90 minutes Khrushchev and Thompson went over the Soviets ' long-delayed reply to the Anglo-U.S. offer of negotiated peace in the faraway Southeast Asia state that is sundered by Communist attack . The Soviets accepted the proposal , more or less , announcing their decision in a note to London , and agreed to join Britain in an " appeal for a cessation of hostilities in Laos . ' ' <P> The agreement cracked like a broken spring after ten days of mounting tension that saw John Fitzgerald Kennedy matched off against Nikita Khrushchev in a classic war of nerves . The war was fought against a sizable buildup of U.S. forces all across the Pacific . Tempers sharpened as the U.S. passed quiet word of deadlines that were just as quietly ignored by the Russians . The U.S. set out to rally its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met secretly with theirs at a meeting of the War , saw Pact countries . With a loose agreement to negotiate , neither Kennedy nor Khrushchev came out the clear-cut victor . But by delaying their answer , the Russians had once again indicated that they felt that time was . and would continue to be , on their side . <P> Time for Advancement . Rather than submit to the Anglo-U.S. demand that an immediate cease-fire order precede any peace conference . Moscow called for talks forthwith and said vaguely that the Laotian belligerents should hammer out their own ceasefire . This could conceivably give time for the Red-led Pathet Lao forces to advance as they did last week ( see THE WORLD ) . The talks would include prompt convocation of the three-nation International Control Commission ( Canada , India , Poland ) in Delhi and the opening of a 14-nation conference-notably including Communist China-in Cambodia . The U.S. shuddered at the thought of being involved in a prolonged negotiation while the Pathet Lao continued its offensive . <P> Just back from SEATO . Secretary of State Dean Rusk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Kennedy . " The Soviet note contains certain observations with which we can not agree . ' ' said Kennedy dryly . But . he added , it " offers hope that a way can be found to establish a neutral and independent Laos through negotiations . The first need is to bring the present fighting in Laos to an end . ' ' <P> Into the Garden . President Kennedy 's flexings of U.S. diplomacy and power were the first of his Administration . Fortnight ago . he roused his countrymen by declaring that the safety of Laos " runs with the safety of us all . " and he dispatched the U.S. Seventh Fleet and supporting forces toward Laos to back his implied deadline on a cease-fire in Laos . Kennedy flew to Key West for a first meeting with Britain 's Prime Minister Harold Macmillan early last week , met next day at the White House with Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko at Gromyko 's request .
