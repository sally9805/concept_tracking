New light-verse forms are as rare as septuplets , and as vulnerable . Latest in the long line of poetic inventions-and , it is to be hoped , not too vulnerable-is the double dactyl , the result of a collaboration of two poet-professors , Anthony Hecht of Bard College and John Hollander of Hunter . According to the rules set forth in Jiggery-Pokery ( 112 pages ; Atheneum ; $3.95 ) , all the poems must begin with a double-dactyl nonsense line such as " higgledy-piggledy " or " jiggery-pokery . " Thereafter comes a famous name-also double dac tylic-followed by another double dactyl and a line of four beats . Then it begins all over again , ending , like all jokes , with a punch line . To make things more sporting , somewhere along the way is a double-dactylic line of one word . Example : <P> <P> Higgledy-piggledy Hans Christian Andersen Sat with some towheaded Lads on a shelf , <P> Mythopoetically Hoping that fairytales Aided in keeping his Hans to himself . <P> <P> As the practitioner grows more skilled , he may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case of Crime and Punishment , to dialect : <P> <P> Higgledy-piggledy Rodya Raskolnikov Belted two dames with a Broad-bladed ax . " I am the wictim of Misericordia , Beaten , " said he , " by re-Legion and sax . " <P> <P> Or to history : <P> <P> Higgledy-piggledy , Benjamin Harrison , Twenty-third President , Was , and , as such , <P> Served between Clevelands , and Save for this trivial Idiosyncracy , Did n't do much . <P> <P> As rhythmically insidious as the clack of rails under a train , double dactyls have already infected Eastern campuses , and may soon spread cross-country . If they do , the book 's collaborators are forewarned : <P> <P> Higgledy-piggledy Anthony/Hollander Two poetasters who Write with one hand <P> Soon have to issue new <P> Co-miscellanea <P> If they 're to live off the <P> Fad of the land .
