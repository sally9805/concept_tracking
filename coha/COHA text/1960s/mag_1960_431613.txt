 | Do You Have a Hidden Allergy ? This is the month -- the sneezing season for eight million hay-fever victims -- when allergy hits the headlines . But , more and more , it 's making news the year round . If you could concentrate all known allergy sufferers in one place , you 'd have a city almost 10 times the size of Detroit . At least one of every 10 Americans -- 17 million in all -- is allergic to something or other , in one way or other . And some authorities say , you 'd have to double that figure if you lumped in all the people who may have allergy without knowing it -- fatigue and heart and brain types of allergy , and other curious , even bizarre forms . Allergy ranks as on eof the most common and most puzzling of all disorders . Here 's a rundown on what science knows -- and does n't know -- about it . What does " allergy " mean ? Not even medical researchers have a completely satisf tory definition . Literally , it means altered reaction . Y do n't understand that ? The experts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that can be said with certain is that allergy is a peculiar sensitivity that some people velop to substances that are ordinarily harmless to m other people . Who can become allergic ? Anybody . At any time . The infant in the crib is subject to eczema ; the growing child , to asthma ; the adult worker can lose his job , or find it torture , because of allergy to substances he has to work with . At least 20 percent of all occupational disorders now are allergic and the work loss runs to around 25 million man-days a year . Is allergy increasing ? Yes . One reason : We 're being exposed at a fabulous clip to new man-made substances that can produce sensitivity . Every 24 minutes now , some new chemical compound is introduced by industry . Another reason : the constant spreading out of allergic sensitivities by inheritance . Must you inherit allergy ? You do n't have to . There are both hereditary and acquired types . Actually , it 's not a specific allergy that is inherited ? but rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family , the more likely the allergic inheritance ? and the earlier the trouble . With one allergic parent , one-third of the children have allergy before age 10 ; with two allergic parents , two-thirds of the children have it , usually before age six . Even so , there 's no telling what form it will take . An asthmatic father may have a child with hay fever or eczema who will never get asthma . Or an egg-sensitive mother may have a child who thrives on egg but ca n't tolerate wheat . But even without a hereditary background , you can pick 86 POPULAR SCIENCE AUGUST 1960 By Lawrence Galton  | How does an allergic reaction develop ? Allergy , somebody once remarked , began as a by-product of nature 's mechanism for keeping the individual alive ? and has gone on to make him sometimes wish he were dead . If you 're allergic , it 's as if you 're prepared to defend yourself against enemies that never were . Normally , when disease germs enter your body , your blood turns out special chemicals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in many people the blood is fooled , the mechanism goes wrong , and antibodies are poured out for dust , pollen , eggs , or other substances riot necessarily harmful . Once this happens , you 're " sensitized . " Next time you 're exposed to one of these substances , there 's war . The antibodies are in the blood , waiting . They collide with the dust or egg . A chemical , histamine , is thrown off in the reaction . This chemical , like a cloud of radioactive dust after an atomic explosion , can settle all over the body . Any place it lands that happens to be especially sensitive to it ? the skin , breathing passages , stomach , even the heart ? reacts . How allergic can you get ? One eight-year-old Oklahoma boy is violently allergic to almost everything ? from chocolate , fruits , fresh milk , and every kind of pet except goldfish , to pillows , starch , flannel , rugs , and many drugs . You can be so sensitive that you do n't even have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machinist , who developed an allergy to naphtha used in the shop for cleaning machine parts , got a disabling skin outbreak over his whole body . Off the job for several weeks , his skin cleared . Advised by his doctor not to return to the same kind of work , he went back only to tell his employer he was quitting . He did n't go into the shop itself , only to the office . Next day , his hands and face were swollen .  |p881  Can allergy be a killer ? Yes , but fortunately deaths from overwhelming alle reactions ? anaphylactic shock ? are rare . Such reactions ? a shot of penicillin , for instance ? are often foreshadowed less-severe previous reactions to the same thing . They be avoided . And when they do occur , it 's often possible f emergency treatment ? a shot of adrenalin ? to save life . What substances cause allergy ? An almost endless variety . You can inhale them , swall them , or get them onto or under your skin . Some years ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down with allergy to money ? ink on a new currency Can you be allergic to people ? A woman in Des Moines won a divorce when she testified that her husband 's presence gave her hives . A New York woman often went to Arizona where she got relief from her asthma ? except , she discovered , when her husband went along with her . She now lives in New York , free of both asthma and husband . You hear such stories . However , the fact seems to be that there 's no allergy to another person ? but to something connected with that person . This can range from the hair lotion he uses to the lipstick she wears . How common is insect allergy ? More common , according to recent research , than anybody ever thought . Allergic reactions to bee and wasp stings are well known . Mosquito bites , too , can produce severe reactions in sensitive people . Asthma from bedbug bites has been reported . Fleas and lice produce their share of allergic reactions . And only recently has come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hay fever . Just as grass , ragweed , and other pollens get into the air , so do tiny , disintegrated bits of dust given off by millions of insects . Some of the trouble sources : May flies , silk pupae , house flies , grasshoppers , melon flies , mosquitoes , honey bees , and water fleas. 88 POPULAR SCIENCE AUGUST 1960 In Toronto , one young man was in danger of losing his loved because she got hives every time she saw him . F tunately , it turned out that she was n't allergic to him only to his gifts of candy . He changed his tactics and w her with flowers . Among the most common allergens ( the word for allergyproducers ) are milk , wheat , and eggs ; pollens and house dust ; fabrics ; dyes , and solvents . Once only proteins , the essence of living matter , were believed to be allergens . Now it 's known that almost anything can produce allergy , maybe by hitching a ride on body proteins . Many drugs ? antibiotics , hormones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in susceptible people . You can also develop allergy to light , heat , and cold .  | Can you be allergic to drinking or smoking ? Tobacco is the allergen most often associated with heart allergy , some researchers believe . In one study of 100 men with heart disease , all heavy smokers , 44 were found to be sensitive to tobacco . There have been medical reports that some patients whose hearts " jumped " or beat irregularly or who had pains around the heart have been relieved by abstaining from smoking . Alcohol has been found responsible for heart symptoms ? and for others as well . One physician has reported the case of a man with a serious eye disease ? acute glaucoma ? who was a heavy wine drinker . When tests showed allergy to grape and he stopped the wine drinking , it cleared up . How else can allergy affect you ?

His colleagues , who put him through many tests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the problem by banning milk . This is one of many cases of allergic fatigue reported in medical literature . There have been many reports , too , of " cerebral allergy , " which is believed to act like giant hives in the brain . It produces swellings and pressure that can cause a wide variety of mental symptoms . One group of allergists reported studying 5,000 patients with depression , sluggish thinking , and many other symptoms , including stuttering ? all traced to allergy and relieved by anti-allergic treatment . Another group of nine allergists put on an exhibit at an American Psychiatric Association meeting showing that symptoms of mental disturbance , ranging from moodiness and irritability to maniacal behavior , can come from foods . Corn , wheat , coffee , milk , eggs , and potatoes ? in that order ? are the worst offenders . The allergists reported producing neurotic symptoms at will simply by feeding patients foods to which they were susceptible . In minutes or hours , depending on the quantity given , the patients became dopey , drowsy , and unable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotions cause allergy ? Some psychiatrists have claimed that allergic disorders are all in the mind . Some allergists say emotions do n't enter into allergies at all . Many doctors now take the middle ground . They believe that allergy is a physical disorder but that it sometimes can be greatly aggravated by emotional problems . Is allergy outgrown ? Sometimes allergies disappear spontaneously . But most do not . One popular belief ? that the asthmatic child will outgrow his condition ? is particularly dangerous . Untreated Continued on page 188 89 p  | asthma is likely to persist and , even if it does subside spontaneously , may leave its victim permanently handicapped by lung complications . How can offending allergens be determined ? Skin tests may show them up . The tests are made by putting powdered or liquid allergens on scratches or by injecting solutions of them into the skin . If an itching bump shows up in a few minutes , the test is positive . Elimination diets often help . They start with a few basic foods , then add others until some addition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culprit . Sometimes , not only a good deal of detective work but also a flash of inspiration is needed . One young woman suffered attacks of dizziness that were traced to allergy to sweet potatoes . She stopped eating sweet potatoes . That should have stopped the attacks . It did n't . The doctor was stumped until he had a sudden hunch . She worked in an office . Did she ever lick stamps ? Yes , she said . Stamp glue is made from sweet potatoes . Solution : a moistened sponge instead of licking . Is there a cure for allergy ? No . But sometimes , when only one or a few allergens are involved and they 're the kind that can be avoided , that 's all it takes to forestall trouble . When avoidance is n't possible , drugs may be used . They include antihistamines and cortisone-like hormones . Although they do n't cure , they often provide relief . And they 're useful when the actual cause of allergy ca n't be found . When the cause is known , desensitization often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substances , starting with very small amounts and working up , so as to build up tolerance . Where are they getting with the one-shot treatment ? The wistful hope of hay-fever and other allergy victims has long been for a oneshot immunity treatment ? a single injection that would protect them for a whole season , avoiding the 14 to 20 an-@#  | Do You Have a Hidden Allergy ? nual visits to the doctor now required for desensitization shots . Today , such treatment is in sight . For 20 years , Dr. Mary Loveless of Cornell University has been working to develop it . The idea is to put pollens and other allergens into a special carrier solution . This , after one injection , would release the materials slowly and evenly . It 's tricky : Too quick release could provoke severe reaction . But Dr. Loveless has reported success in hundreds of patients with ragweed.dust , grass , and other inhalant sensitivities . And Dr. Ethan Allen Brown of Boston has used the Loveless idea in several thousand patients with reportedly excellent results .
