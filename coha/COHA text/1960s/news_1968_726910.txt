txt A Pacific " summit " meeting like the Manila conference is likely , though not sure , this coming spring . It will not be easy to arrange . All the allies assisting the Saigon government are reexamining their attitudes , if not their policies , toward the war as a result of the big Viet Cong raids and whatever may happen at the demilitarized zone . The South Koreans are unhappy about not being represented at Panmunjom and not being better equipped for a North Korean offensive . A meeting will not be called unless there are grounds for a constructive result . But the tradition of periodic meetings was established . And allies need to consult , or misunderstandings will develop . So a conference remains a better-than-not possibility despite the upset and fluid state of the Vietnam war . e Until recently little could be done to stop harassing or obscene telephone calls . Now the American Telephone &; Telegraph Company has a device which enables it to track down offending callers . The gadget is placed in the residence of the person being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a button on the device , which alerts the telephone company . Even if the caller hangs up , the company can still trace the call . So widespread has this particular type of cowardice become that a technological breakthrough has been long overdue . AT &T; reports that last year it received 58,000 complaints a month about such calls . A House Interstate Commerce subcommittee is currently considering measures to make interstate use of the telephone for such purposes a federal offense . The new electronic device should make present state laws enforceable for the first time . It also should give reason to push for federal statutes . The Pentagon has been able to buck a nationwide trend and hold its education costs nearly level . ? Expenses for training next year are expected to be $4.4 billion  --  only $11 million more than for the current year . The basic reason is that the record build-up of forces has passed and defense establishment strengths are expected to remain about the same . The three services will train about 883,000 recruits next year and give advance training in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be given at the post-graduate level in both military and civilian schools . About 3,000 students are to be enrolled in top-level military schools . Another 2,800 officers will be doing graduate work in colleges and universities . Costliest training given by the Pentagon : for pilots . It costs more than $1.5 billion annually . Trends ... Washington continues to expand its programs to curb the world 's population explosion . The Agency for International Development has given birth control top priority in developing countries , along with food production . In 1964 the agency spent nothing at all on birth control . In fiscal 1967 it spent $4.2 million . The current fiscal year will see an even bigger budget . Some $35 million of foreign aid funds are specifically earmarked for such programs . And now AID is giving money to American research institutions . It is handing $1 million over a two-year period to the Carolina Population Center at the University of North Carolina , and $400,000 over two years to the Johns Hopkins population unit . The Carolina group will work on programs for Thailand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on India , Nigeria , and Latin America . How and why . ? As it looks from here , African politics , still in the settling-down period , remain highly volatile . This fact , currently illustrated by the civil war in Nigeria , can be easily grasped , Washington believes , , simply by glancing at the percentage of African rulers who have held power for only three years or less . The figure is 17 ? which represents nearly half of all African leaders . In addition , two other African leaders have ruled for only four years , two for five , one for six , two for seven , and eight for eight years . The record-holder , of course , is Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia , who came to the throne in 1930 . President Tubman has led Liberia since 1943.
