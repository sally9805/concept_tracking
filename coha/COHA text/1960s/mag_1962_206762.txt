India &; Illusions <P> Sir : <P> A million thanks to President Kennedy and to the American people as well for rushing to India 's aid in her hour of peril . <P> Undoubtedly , you are our real friends , and we Indians are ashamed that not only has our Prime Minister equated you with the Russians , who have more or less washed their hands of us , but said in the Indian Parliament Nov. 23 : " They Americans and British help us-they feel this involves many issues in which they themselves are intensely interested , " implying that American and British generosity in arms is entirely self-serving . <P> We are truly ashamed that Mr. Nehru has had the bad grace to voice these sentiments , considering the mammoth help America is pouring into India so graciously and unstintingly , with ' ' no strings attached . " We realize perfectly well that if America so wished , it could have , justifiably , torn our foolish foreign policy to shreds before granting aid . <P> <P> ( MRS . ) MACCA M. CHOKSI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threatened by Communism from both within and without , and nobody is more aware of this than Jawaharlal Nehru . Yet in spite of these facts , or indeed very much because of them , India 's safest course remains that of nonalignment . Critics in the West should ask themselves what possible positive contribution India could make as a declared ally at this time . <P> I myself believe that it is in the West 's interests to keep India out of the mainstream of the cold war as much as possible . In this way India will have a much better chance to build a stable , economically sound democratic system ; and she will also be considerably more effective as a moderating influence on other , less responsible Asian and African countries . <P> <P> JOHN O. FIELD Madras , India <P> Man of the Year <P> Sir : <P> We , the citizens of the United States who bear most of the world 's problems on our shoulders , and all of them in our hearts ; not always graciously , nor always willingly , but always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MESSURIER Wharton School of Finance and Commerce University of Pennsylvania Philadelphia <P> Sir : <P> The Man of the Year must be the U.S. citizen . He put his country , family and life on the line in forcing the President to action . <P> <P> DALE DONOVAN Lynchburg , Va . <P> <P> Sir : <P> There is absolutely no doubt-General de Gaulle has won the title grandly . <P> <P> PIERRE Ajoux Pebble Beach , Calif . <P> <P> Sir : <P> We nominate Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt as the Woman of the Year . No other person had such an impact for good on the world during the past decade . <P> <P> ROSWELL &; LOIS JOHNSON Los Angeles <P> Sir : <P> I nominate the seven astronauts , for their bravery and courage in the beginning stage of the conquest of space . <P> <P> ROBERT PINZLER East Meadow , N.Y . <P> <P> Sir : <P> How about making up for your error in slighting the Man of the Past Several Decades by honoring Dr. Jonas Salk ? <P> <P> WARREN F.
