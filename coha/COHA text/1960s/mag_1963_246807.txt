Yalemen , like most collegians , have long dwelt in the shadow of the gargoyle . Gothic architecture , with its encrusted spires and ogives , was the accepted way of making scholarship look more scholarly . But no longer . In the past few years more advanced architecture has risen on Yale 's 150 acres in New Haven , Conn. , than in all of Manhattan with all its forest of new buildings . Some of the Yale structures are ordinary , but the boldest buildings have succeeded in giving modern architecture a host of new directions . <P> <P> Instead of picking one official architect-such as James Gamble Rogers , who weighted the campus down with his Girder Gothic of the late 1920s and ' 30s , Yale turned to a number of the most lustrous and far-out contemporary master builders : Eero Saarinen , Gordon Bunshaft , Paul Rudolph , Philip Johnson and Louis Kahn . They adhered to no single style , only to the modern mood , which freely explores how steel , glass and reinforced concrete can most beautifully be bent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a laboratory than a museum . <P> Yale 's 250-year-old urban campus was a particularly cramped site for experiment ; over the years , an ever-growing university had to build on top of itself . Cheek-by-jowl existed buildings from the colonial brick of Connecticut Hall where Nathan Hale once lived , to Skidmore , Owings &; Merrill 's dark glass box containing the university 's IBM computer center . At one end of the campus is an electricity-generating powerhouse in , of all things , Gothic ; not far away is a student dwelling , Davenport College , so eclectic that its street fac.ade is pseudo-Gothic and its courtyard colonial brick . <P> <P> Humpbacked Spine . " No common denominator , except quality , " proclaimed President A. Whitney Griswold , whose 13-year tenure ( 1950-63 ) produced Yale 's architectural renascence . Under Griswold , no fewer than 26 new buildings were commissioned . He turned first to his own architecture department for a man whose reputation is greater than the number of buildings he has put up , Louis Kahn . Kahn gave Yale its first real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extension to the existing Lombardic-Romanesque one . Kahn , like Corbusier , let the concrete shapes retain the rough marks of the wood forms in which they were cast . He also made his ceilings support themselves , by means of small concrete tetrahedrons , which replace obtrusive beams . <P> The next architect to catch Griswold 's eye was the late Eero Saarinen , Yale ' 34 . Commissioned to do simply a hockey rink , Saarinen achieved a daring structure whose wooden roof is slung from a single humpbacked reinforced concrete spine , so that inside there are no pillars to block the view . Saarinen spent far more than the money that had been budgeted for the project , but the hockey rink so pleased critics and trustees alike that Saarinen subsequently was put to drawing up a master development plan for Yale . Along the line he won a commission close to his own heart : two brand-new colleges ( see color ) - Yale 's first since 1940.                    @
