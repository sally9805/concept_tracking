" H. L. Mencken defined a judge as a law student who grades his own papers , " writes Manhattan Internist John Prutting in the New York State Journal of Medicine . " A similar view might be taken of the physician who fails to submit his diagnostic skills to that impartial grader , the autopsy . " With that , Dr. Prutting put in a plea for more autopsies , which would enable more doctors to compare more diagnoses with actual causes of death . <P> Only about 30% of U.S. deaths are followed by autopsies , and when postmortem findings are compared with ante-mortem diagnoses , glaring discrepancies often occur . Less than 50% of all cases of pulmonary embolism ( in which a massive blood clot travels to the lungs ) is correctly diagnosed before death . In 200 cases of bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract , the diagnosis was wrong 33% of the time , and 37 cases of bleeding peptic ulcer were missed . Among 85 cases of liver abscess , 53 were unsuspected until the autopsy . <P> Dr. Prutting concedes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technical aids do not make it infallible , so the findings should always be checked . To rouse physicians , Dr. Prutting urges hospital pathologists to educate their colleagues at weekly " organ recitals " for comparison of diagnoses and autopsy findings . This still might not increase the number of autopsies substantially , for in most states , if death occurs in a hospital or is not " suspicious , " an autopsy is illegal without consent of the next of kin . Dr. Prutting suggests that " archaic state laws " should be revised so that consent is not required , and the dead can aid the living .
