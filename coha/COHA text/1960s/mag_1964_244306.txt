ROMAN CATHOLICS <P> His Eminence Julius Cardinal Dopfner was the youngest bishop in Europe at the age of 35 ; ten years later , in 1958 , he became the youngest member of the College of Cardinals . Today he governs the powerful See of Munich , and was one of four prelates chosen by Pope Paul VI as " moderators " to oversee the debates at the second session of the Vatican Council . Last week he made the most direct statement yet by any cardinal on the need for a genuine reform of the Roman Catholic Church , and defined that reformation-already begun , but as yet unfinished-as the true aim of the Vatican Council . <P> <P> When Dopfner speaks , others listen , and 2,800 people-including priests , foreign diplomats and non-Catholic clergy-gathered in Munich 's Congress Hall to hear him . It turned out to be , said one excited Lutheran churchman after ward , " the first time anyone so high up in the Catholic hierarchy has made a speech quite so daring . " <P> Superannuated Souvenir . " Masses of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because to many the Catholic Church appeared as " an institution that enslaved freedom " and as a " superannuated souvenir from a past age . " It spoke to man in an ancient tongue , through incomprehensible rituals , in preaching concepts that have no relation to current life . Instead of penetrating the world , the church seemed to sit " in a self-imposed ghetto , trying to build its own small world adjoining the big world . " Tied to " antiquated forms , " Catholicism often gave the appearance of resenting the inescapable presence of ideological pluralism , political democracy and modern technology . <P> These unpleasant truths persuaded Pope John XXIII that the council was needed , and gave new force to the traditional understanding of Catholicism as ecclesia semper reformanda-a church ever in need of reform . Christ himself was free of sin ; but the continuation of his work , Dopfner pointed out , " has been entrusted to frail , sinful humans . " Thus the church has sometimes been guilty of " failing to achieve what God had desired . The presentation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uses the means of power instead of humility , of force instead of service . " <P> <P> This means , according to Dopfner , that any reform can only be carried out by the church at the council in a spirit of penitence , or metanoia , in the knowledge that it is " a community of sinners . " Reform also must be based on the teachings of Christ and Holy Scripture . It also must be in the nature of renovation rather than revolution , preserving what is good from the past tradition while remaining open to future possibilities of development . " We are in danger of resisting ideas , forms and possibilities to which perhaps the future belongs , and we often consider as impossible that which will finally manifest itself as a legitimate form of Christianity , " said the cardinal .
