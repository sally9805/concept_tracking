Dr. Alonzo G. Grace , dean of the University of Illinois school of education , is the third member . Havighurst agreed M eliminate suggested answers to the question on why teachers want to transfer to another school . These included distance of school from home , school neighborhood , characteristics of pupils , dissatisfaction with school administration , dissatisfaction with educational program in school and dissatisfaction with working conditions . " I object to those three ' dissatisfaction ' in a row , " Smith said . " We do n't have to put words in a teacher 's mouth . Dr. Havighurst does n't either .

Both agreed to revise the format on curriculum guide questions . Teachers were asked to rate the usefulness of the guides on the basis of excellent , good , fair , or unsatisfactory . Then they were requested to check the degree to which they used the guides in planning lessons and the amount of help received in using curriculum guides from , principals , supervisors , or consultants .

Quiz on Integration Items call for views on the handling of problems of racial integration and segregation , the availability and adequacy of substitute teachers , the amount of time required for clerical duties , the amount of time spent outside of school hours on the job , and the availability of textbooks . Smith denied the school administration objected to the questionnaire because it is too sensitive to criticism . " If a teacher is disgruntled , he will say so in the questionnaire , " he said . " The questionnaire is not primarily aimed at receiving complaints , " Havighurst said . " We want to know teachers ' attitudes toward their jobs . Complaints are a small element in the questionnaire . I am not looking for them . " Both Havighurst and Smith said they wished the meeting to iron out the difficulties over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
