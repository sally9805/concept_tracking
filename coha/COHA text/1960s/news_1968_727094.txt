txt " Everyone should come to the Paris talks ready to give . No one . can win a ' victory ' here that he could not win on the battlefield . We will all have to work very hard for agreements that will be reasonable and acceptable to everyone , " said a high American official as the peace talks began . " Governments should not come here unless they are ready to make concessions as well as to win them . That goes for peoples too , as well as governments , including the American people . " There are many governments , allies , and political groups represented here , " he con- tinued . There is also , he indicated , a great need for stability and a framework for peacetime growth in an Asia that is changing fast and is full of conflicts and national interests . " It will not be easy to fit all this together , and it will take great effort on the part of all of us , " he added . He is , he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done . The question is whether it will . The basis for an equitable settlement is admittedly present as the conference opens . It is free elections in South Vietnam . Point No. 7 in the 1954 Geneva Declaration , signed by North and South Vietnam , Communist China , and the Soviet Union among others , reads : " The conference declares that . . the settlement of political problems .. . on the basis of respect for the principles of independence , unity , and territorial integrity , shall permit the Vietnamese people to enjoy the fundamental freedoms , guaranteed by democratic institutions established as a result of free general elections by secret ballot . " Exchanges continue . These were to be held under international inspection . Since the Geneva agreements now have been accepted in advance by both sides , as a basis for negotiation , it appears that an accord is not impossible , however difficult to achieve . The atmosphere here , as the parties start down the long road to a political settlement in a situation where military settlement seemed impossible , is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortnight ago . Both sides have shown by their latest concessions and maneuvers , according to a veteran observer of East-West talks , that they are serious about the meeting here , whatever their ultimate aims . Their earlier rough-tough propaganda exchanges seem likely to continue . At least , that is the general expectation as delegations and allies talk among themselves ? vith furious last-minute intensity , in a blinding light of world publicity . But the propaganda has been eclipsed by a sudden willingness of Hanoi , that does not seem to have been expected in the West , to give up the slow and rigid , stageby-stage schedule that it had insisted upon for the negotiations . There is general hope here for a fairly free agenda in which substantive issues can be discussed soon . However , the first imperative still is that of ending the bombing of North Vietnam , which President Johnson said on March 31 that he was willing to do , given a basis to " assume " that Hanoi would not take military advantage of it . As the talks open there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are emphasizing the " unprecedented volume of infiltration " by North Vietnamese military units into South Vietnam that has continued , American intelligence says , right up to the present . Meanwhile , the United States has been pushing a series of large scale military operations in Vietnam officially described as " spoiling attacks " to prevent a regrouping of the enemy , but also serving as a counterpoise to the buildup by Hanoi . Finally there is the current renewal on a small scale of the Tet offensive against // *U.S. official says both sides must be ' ready to give ' // South Vietnamese cities . And there is the fact that President Johnson has held back on sending sizable reinforcements of American manpower to Vietnam , presumably waiting to see what happens at Paris . These distant rumblings from the battle ; . field have some American officials here on edge . How long will American opinion permit a halt in the bombing of North Vietnam while a massive infiltration continues ? Others have taken it for granted that fairly big military operations by both sides would continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reinforcement ' of its forces in the South , as the Johnson . administration 7has demanded . Air of restraint noted There are many rumors and much speculation but no hard information here on how these first stages of " reduction of the violence " are to be worked out . If an adjustment is not made the talks could break up on this one point alone . The best that can be said is that the more sanguine Western observers and delegates are inclined to think matters would not have progressed this far if Hanoi was unwilling to trade a " normal " level of military reinforcement for an end to the bombing in the North . There is little disposition to indulge in purple prose and high-flown statements as the talks get under way . This is a working conference on a grimly realistic level , despite the flurry of excitement that surrounds the opening hours and comes naturally in Paris . In private talks there is full appreciation of the gravity of the moment . Success could bring better and even nonviolent ways to settle the conflicts that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through military confrontation . There appears to be a growing sense on both sides that these conflicts are essentially political in nature and that military strength should be reduced to a police function rather than the dominant , overriding role of the postwar years .
