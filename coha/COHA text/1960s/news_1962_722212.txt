txt Briton Charges We Meanwhile s Overlook Communism 's Threat c TO THE EDITOR OF T HE NEW YORK TIMER : I was nauseated by the complacent " we can be proud that we are always right " attitude expressed in the letter from five members of the Yale Law School faculty in The Times of Dec. 29 . Many of the world 's problems are aggravated by the fact that people and governments of many nations are so convinced that their policies alone are the right ones that they never pause to consider " are we wrong after all ? " My own fellow countrymen ( British ) are doubtless no exception . Everyone in the West must acknowledge that the strength of the United States , allied to its principles of human freedom and self-determination , represents the world 's ultimate hope against communism . However , British people have been hurt , aghast and dumfounded to find that American policy has more than once been influenced rather by the world 's colonial pimples than by its Communist cancer . When Britons of my generation ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sorry results of the 1944-45 peace conferences could be attributed to the fact that America regarded British imperialism with more apprehension than Russian communism , and leaned on Russian " good faith , " we gasped in incredulous disbelief . But many Americans that I have met in my eight months here assure me that it is true . Reaction to Take-Over The stand over Suez may be more debatable . But supposing the British Government suddenly " took over " all profit-making industrial plants in England that have been built by American capital and demanded the withdrawal of all American imperialists , how would the Yale Law School members react then ? Colonialism has many factors on its credit side apart from the loudly publicized baser aspects . If anyone doubts the enlightenment of current British colonial policy let him recall the rapturous receptions accorded to the Queen on her visits . So , to me , American anti-colonialism , sometimes overshadowing anti-communism , is more dangerous and out of date than the old-type colonialism itself . My 1962 appeal to America would be " know who are your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same ideas of parliamentary freedom az you do , and formulate your policies accordingly . Above all let us all realize that perhaps our policies are not always right and let us be ever ready to modify them accordingly . " Then the British and American people can live in a spirit of complete mutual friendship and trust , which is essential for the future of the world but which is occasionally so hurtfully and ridiculously missing .

Recognition of China Queried TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : In an editorial of Dec. 29 " A Policy for China " you ventured a possible recognition of Red China . The notable part of such a suggestion , coming from The Times , is its implication that the little people no longer matter . We can do no honor to ourselves or to China unless we can reach the people of China , and make our action understandable to them . We would be dealing a crushing blow to the Chinese , in whom lies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were we to give recognition to the regime which so completely enslaves them , body and soul . The people of China could then see neither honor nor pity in us . We have no way of dispelling their Government 's lies about us , except by our refusal to deal with that Government in a conventional manner . If we can not reach the people . where but in a political morass is this " recognition " going to lead us ? Never , as long as we desire to do honor to the Constitution , should we grant recognition , or even continue to give recognition , or any country that will not give us the privilege of stating our beliefs within that country , to at least the degree that they can spread their beliefs in ours . The shame that is ours is that we fail to honor our forefathers ' faith in the truth , and in our purpose , and that we do so in full knowledge of the fact . You have always been quick to declare that the American people will choose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Before you throw your great weight behind an effort to influence this present American regime toward recognition of Red China . I pray you to urge that the American people be given the opportunity , in public referendum to declare themselves on such a choice . The future of this civilization we enjoy might well depend upon it . FRANK K. NELSON . Babylon , N. Y. , Jan. 6 , 1961 . College Reception Praised Communist Speaker Says Students Held Orderly Meeting TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK Tams : The news story on page 7 of The New York Times of Dec. 22 gave an entirely one-sided and misleading account of my speaking engagement at City College on Dec. 21 . I addressed an audience of some 200 or more students in Room 217 of Finley Hall , at which there was standing room only , with many students seated on the floor and in the aisles and others on the outside unable to get in . The meeting was orderly and courteous , although the overwhelming majority of the students who listened did not agree with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the auspices of the Public Affairs Forum of the Student Government of City College and was a celebration of the victory for academic freedom , achieved when the Administrative Council of the City University lifted the ban against Communist speakers . Since it was the cancellation of my speech at Queens College last Oct. 10 that originally triggered the ban , it was understandable that the Student Government organization invited me to participate in the celebration of its reversal . The Student Government is composed of members of many different political views ; consequently the , meeting was of a nonpartisan character , as was the struggle to lift the I ban . Successfully Conducted Having been responsibly conducted , the meeting was wholly successful . I have a tape recording of the entire proceedings which proves the fact . It is available to The Times or any other persons or organizations interested in the truth . The hoodlum demonstration that occurred after the meeting , in Finley Hall and in the streets , was participated in by about fifteen or twenty students who , bearing ultraRight slogans and rejecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their fists , in the name ' of free speech . Nevertheless , they were such a tiny minority compared to the 200 or more students who participated in the meeting that it is difficult to see how they were the main event . Even among the group that followed me from 133d Street and Convent Avenue to 127th Street and St. Nicholas Avenue , the majority were students who came along to see that the threats of violence from the jeering ultra-Rightists did not go beyond threats . Since The New York Times was also editorially opposed to the ban by the Administrative Council , one would think that it would be equally opposed to an attempt by a minority to reimpose the ban by hoodlumism and violence . BENJAMIN J. DAVIS . New York , Dec. 27 , 1961 . Commandment on Love TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Ordinarily I would not take issue with a Christmas message . But your editorial of Dec. 25 contains a statement which , as it stands , is factually inaccurate and helps to perpetuate a misimpression that ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your statement : " No religion can be hostile to the Sermon on the Mount or to the new commandment that Jesus gave his disciples , that . they love one another . " The commandment " thou shalt love they neighbor as thyself " was first proclaimed in the Mosaic Law ( Leviticus 19:16 ) centuries before Jesus . Unfortunately , in its over three thousand year or so history , this commandment has found fuller expression in the utterances of man than in his deeds . RABBI ZEVULUN CIIARLOP . New York , Dec. 26 , 1961 . The reference in the editorial was to the Gospel of John XIII , 34 : " A. new commandment I give unte you , that you love one another . " Of course , it was also in the Mosaic Law centuries earlier.  - -  Editor , The Times . Loss of Transfers Protested TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Citizens trying to transfer on Fifth Avenue buses are now told , with Mayor Wagner 's sanction , no more transfers . But be happy as you pay a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-approved hike of $10,000 in salary , has transferred from his old Cadillac to a new one . EDWARD A. LEWIN .
