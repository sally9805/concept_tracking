RACES <P> ( See Cover ) <P> Through an angry summer of racial rioting , the pillagers , the arsonists and the snipers , the anarchists , the loudmouths and the demagogues have held the center of the stage . When the fury abates and the fires die down , a wholly different cast of characters will move in to repair the damage . These are the real revolutionaries , the men who have been laboring undramatically for years , and in some cases for decades , to secure for the Negro a more equitable share of America 's affluence . " These are the people who can do more , " says Massachusetts Republican Edward Brooke , the first Negro in the U.S. Senate since Reconstruction . " They can accomplish something that the militants can not . " <P> <P> They can , that is , unless the Negro Revolution follows the classic pattern and devours the very men who did most to set it in motion , replacing them with extremist firebrands . In the wretched Negro slums , the more moderate Negro leaders pack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and chant murderous antiwhite slogans . " A black man today , " insists one Black Power advocate , " is either a radical or an Uncle Tom . " In fact , only a fraction of America 's 22 million Negroes falls into either category . What worries the moderates is that increasing numbers of ghetto dwellers seem more susceptible than ever to the " Burn , baby , burn ! " appeal of the radicals . Whitney M. Young Jr. , 46 , executive director of the National Urban League and probably the most effective man in the nation when it comes to drumming up jobs for Negroes , says : " Whether the moderates can prevail will be determined by whether there is an immediate and tangible response to the riots from the white community . " Adds Young , in the phrase with which he addresses mayors and businessmen : " You 've got to give us some victories . " <P> Broad Paths . Young 's concern is shared by other top-echelon Negro leaders-most notably A. Philip Randolph , president of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Associa tion for the Advancement of Colored People ; and Martin Luther King , winner of the 1964 Nobel Peace Prize and president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference . Each has explored broad pathways to Negro advancement : Randolph in the labor movement , Wilkins by affirming legal rights , King by awakening the nation 's conscience , Young by opening up economic opportunity . None of the advances came easily or swiftly . <P> Now come the militants-mostly men with minuscule followings and even less in the way of concrete accomplishment for their race-to confront the nation 's Negroes with a choice . " They can try to solve their problems , " says Philadelphia 's U.S. District Judge A. Leon Higginbotham , a Negro , " by supporting people who have programmatic effectiveness , like Whitney Young . Or they can place their faith in others and have another century of increasing chaos . " <P> Wilkins , for one , sees " no discernible danger that the moderates will be overthrown . " Young , similarly , estimates that no more than 3% of U.S. Ne groes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that Congress , " in its obvious efforts to avoid rewarding the rioters , " will embark on " a course of
