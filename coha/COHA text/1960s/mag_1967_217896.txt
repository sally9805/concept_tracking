Once it was a baseball glove . Then it was a football . Now the first present an ambitious father gives his boy is likely to be a matched set of woods and irons . <P> Five years ago , the total prize money on the pro golf tour amounted to $ 1,791,816 . Next year it will hit $5,000,000-which works out to $25,000 a head for the 200 pros on the tour . A fellow could put himself into a way-up tax bracket merely by winning one tournament : the $250,000 Westchester Classic , whose first prize will be $50,000 . Or he could try to win them all-in which case his gross would be $1,000,000 . Or he could just plug along , enjoying the exercise . If he finished no better than 15th in every tournament , his income would be $90,000.
