Sunday school is mostly boring , decided a young Kansas-born Presbyterian minister named James Rayburn , and he felt that it was up to him to do something to bring the Bible alive for teenagers . In 1940 he organized a group in Dallas called Young Life . It grew slowly , gained considerable impetus as Rayburn acquired three ranches in Colorado and a bankrupt vacation resort in British Columbia known as Malibu Beach . The prospect of spending a summer week or more at one of these layouts for a nominal fee of $35 a week did wonders to stimulate the interest of potential Young Lifers . <P> Today Young Life has branches in 250 high-school districts in 23 states , a newspaper , and an annual budget of more than $500,000 . Funds are supplied primarily by contributors , including some big businessmen . There are no membership rolls or dues ; local chapters are open to all , and usually meet with Young Life leaders-volunteer or paid-in the houses of participants . Meetings never last more than an hour , consist of rousing gospel singing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Last week Founder Rayburn faced a stern denunciation of Young Life . Its authors : five of the leading Protestant ministers* in exurban New Canaan , Conn , ( pop . 11,200 ) . Over their names appeared a public statement warning parents against Young Life . <P> Sin &; Boredom . Nub of the ministers ' charge : " Young Life is. in effect , a separate teen-age church , financed and directed by adults who are not answerable to any local group . We believe its outlook is too narrow , and that its emotional effect is eventually damaging to the young people most attracted by its appeal . " <P> Founder Rayburn snapped back at once : " There is professional jealousy in the ministry as well as in other fields . Young Life is not a teen-age church at all . It 's a recruiting program for the church . I am sure we are not narrow unless the Apostles ' Creed is narrow . Some of our critics want to drag us into the old static framework . If that were done , the Young Life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing . Far too many pastors talk about daffodils and robin redbreast . We believe it is sinful to bore kids . " <P> Kids &; Responsibility . New Canaanites turned to the ministers for fuller explanations . Were Young Lifers imbibing a Bible-belt version of the Gospel , which made their drinking , dancing , smoking parents look like sinners ? Said Episcopal Minister Grant Merrill : " The leaders tend in the direction of fundamentalism . They give easy answers to life 's most difficult problems . There is one central headquarters in the West . Their workers are trained there for a few weeks or so , but they are not well trained . Then they come to a community without being responsible to anyone but a headquarters , and that headquarters is not responsible to a denomination . <P> " They say they are Christian , so the parents assume the churches are behind it and they let their children attend . No supervisory body of parents is involved . The kids would substitute these gatherings with other kids for their normal church activities . We feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the children belong in their own spiritual blood family . "
