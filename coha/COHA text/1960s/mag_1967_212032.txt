With ten months to go before the Republican Convention , every professed non-candidate last week was waging his noncampaign in his own noncommittal way . George Romney found his way out of the washing machine and into the ghetto . Nelson Rockefeller hummed September Song . Ronald Reagan transferred his pragmatic ire from Berkeley to the conduct of the war . And Rich ard Nixon , purring like a tabby at the cream bowl , mourned the decline of American prestige abroad . <P> On a 19-day tour of the nation 's slums , Michigan 's Governor did his best to erase memories of Viet Nam and his " brainwashed " gaffe . Convoyed by a horde of reporters and photographers , Romney loped through Negro districts in Detroit , Washington , Rochester and New York . " What 's all this white trash doin ' round here ? " asked one Negro woman as she made way for the Romney cavalcade in Washington . Nonetheless , the response in the slums was generally enthusiastic . " I think he 's a cool dude , " said Rufus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a Negro self-help organization in the capital . " I mean he 's O.K. " <P> Inside Happenings . In the hope of nudging other Republicans to the same conclusion , Romney detoured the poverty pilgrimage long enough for a chat with New York 's Mayor John Lindsay and a 21-hour political strategy dinner with Governor Rockefeller , the Michigander 's strongest backer . Though he could write a Baedeker on New York 's slums and the avoidance of riots , Lindsay decided not to join Romney on a trip through Bedford-Stuyvesant and Harlem . " I think it is better if he goes alone rather than be inhibited by the presence of other officials , " the mayor said delicately . " In other words , " a newsman asked , " it 's best that the Governor is not ' brainwashed ? ' " " I did n't say that , " laughed Lindsay . " You 're being naughty . " <P> Rocky , for his part , remained rigidly faithful to Romney , and ignored Republican moderates who insist that he rev up his own well-oiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statesman , Rockefeller allowed : " Something happens in life and you lose ambition because you have fulfillment . There are things that happen inside . I 'm not a psychiatrist or a psychologist . I ca n't analyze it for you exactly . But I just do n't have the ambition or the need or inner drive-or whatever the word is-to get in again . I 've never been happier or more relaxed or getting more enjoyment or satisfaction out of what I 'm doing . " <P> Wish &; Fact . Many Republicans-influenced perhaps by wish as much as fact-continued to believe that Rocky dreams privately of still greater enjoyment and satisfaction in Washington . Rockefeller 's family even inclined to that view . " I remind you , " noted Nelson 's younger brother , Arkansas ' Governor Winthrop , " that women and politicians have the right to change their minds . " Maryland 's Governor Spiro Agnew was more certain than ever that Rockefeller would run . Agnew 's candidate for Vice President : California 's Governor Reagan .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
