In Europe , capitalism has stubbornly refused to destroy itself , and Europe 's Socialists have found themselves increasingly discredited in a world they never made or even allowed for . Last week Socialists in two major countries reacted in opposite directions to their common dilemma . <P> Out of Date . In Britain , Labor Party Leader Hugh Gaitskell had studied last year 's disastrous election defeat and concluded that change was needed in the party 's doctrinaire constitution , which had not been basically overhauled since 1929 . Specifically he called for repeal of Clause Four , which calls for " common ownership of the means of production , distribution and exchange . " Nationalization had been tried by the Labor Party itself when it was in power and had proved no panacea . In the working man 's affluent world of " the telly , the frig and the car , " Gaitskell argued , the old slogans had no appeal . <P> But it is the older militant generation , weaned on Marxism , that wrote the constitution and that still controls Britain 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote that dominates the annual Labor Party conference . One by one , the big unions lined up against Gaitskell . First Gaitskell backed down to an amendment " recognizing that both public and private enterprise have a place in the economy . " Last week , facing certain defeat at the October conference , Gaitskell surrendered completely . Labor Secretary Morgan Phillips announced that no Clause Four amendment will be offered " this year , next year , or even in 1962 . " <P> Up to Date . Faced with the same problem of continuing electoral defeat , West Germany 's Social Democrats did exactly the reverse . Last November they junked nationalization in favor of a kind of New Deal capitalism , which would include " as much competition as possible , as much planning as necessary . " Three weeks ago -a major post-summit switch-they abandoned their long insistence that Germany might strike a bargain with the Russians , giving up NATO membership in exchange for a unified ( if neutralized ) Germany . Said the party 's Deputy Chairman Herbert Wehner : " Like the Christian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ European pact system and NATO must serve as a basis for any foreign-policy and reunification efforts . " Last week the party 's seven-man electoral strategy committee , further revising the party 's face , picked Berlin 's vigorous Mayor Willy Brandt , 46 , as the party 's candidate for chancellor . <P> Even the Socialists see little hope for victory in the 1961 elections , or as long as Adenauer is on the scene . But the latest moves seem to be on the right track . A recent poll showed the Socialists leading in popularity by a vote of 30% to 29% for the Christian Democrats . That left 12% for the small parties and a decisive 29% in the " do n't know " columns . But it was the best the Socialists had-done since 1956.
