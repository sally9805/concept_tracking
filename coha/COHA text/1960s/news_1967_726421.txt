txt Letters to the Editor of The Times pg . 36 Letters to the Editor of The Times Israeli ' Aggression ' To the Editor : As a fellow clergyman and former student of Henry P. Van Dusen , it is with a heavy heart that I respond to his letter published July 7 . Dr. Van Dusen confesses to be , " aghast at Israel 's onslaught , the most violent , ruthless ( and successful ) aggression since Hit er 's blitzkrieg across Western Europe in the summer of 1940 , aiming not at victory but at annihilation . " I find it hard to believe that Dr. Van Dusen is really the source of this unspeakable distortion of the facts . There is no other course than to speak out in protest , even against a man whom one has honored for years , when that person stoops to call black white , to label as " aggressors " the tar:ets of aggression , and to identify as " annihilationists " those who barely escaped being annihilated by a foe pledged to turning them into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now manifest an almost incredible restraint and readiness to deal righteously with their would-be slayers . Dr. Van . Dusen 's parallel of Nazis with Israelis earns the same reaction that Abba Eban gave in the U.N . Assembly to an identical attempt by the Russians : " The U.S.S.R. has formulated an obscene comparison between the Israel defense forces and the Hitlerite hordes which overran Europe in the Second World War . . . . To associate the name of Israel with the accursed tyrant who engulfed the Jewish people in a tidal wave of slaughter is to violate every canon of elementary taste and ' fundamental truth . " Arab Accusation , In fact , Dr. Van Dusen 's sin is much the greater , because the moral standards with which the Russians associate themselves make no pretense at being Christian . The . Van Dusen charge also bears close affinity to action by the President of an Ai. * nation who , having repeatedly incited Arab armies to " wipe Israel off the face of the earth , " said after the war that " Israel neo-colonialism is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Arab people . " The pathological collective unconscious of Christendom , nurtured by centuries of the churches ' " teaching of contempt " ( Jules Isaac ) for Jews , has at last risen ' to the surface . The Jews are the enemy ; the more they appear to be helpless victims , the more they in actuality conspire as the devil 's own agents of destruction . Dr. Van Dusen asserts , revealingly , that he is " risking alienation from honored and beloved Jewish friends and associates . " He may be assured that Jews are by now quite used to being denounced , and even betrayed , by Gentiles . But the entire Christian community must stand appalled at this unredeemed act of calumhy by one of its erstwhile leaders . In general , perhaps the only eventuality that would mutually satisfy Communist , Arab and Christian detractors of Jews for the latter 's " aggression " would be for Jews to consent to lie down and be slaughtered . At least this would fulfill one . side of the traditional yearning of Christendom , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The only ' good Jew ' is a dead Jew or a Christian . " ( The Rev. ) A. ROY ECKARDT Bethlehem , Pa. , July 8 , 1967 The writer , a minister in the Methodist Church ; is Professor and Chairman of the Department of Religion at Lehigh University , and editor of The Journal of the American Academy of Religion : ? Paley Park ? To the Editor : , Yesterday I walked down 53d Street recalling a thousand hours of glamorous self-destruction we spent at the , Stork , and wondering with contempt about the kind of " park " with which William S. Paley could have replaced the club . At the gateway I stood for half an hour bathed in a cool breeze , and held by that restful simplicity . It must be the most agreeable thing that has happened to Manhattan in fifty years . Could it possibly be contagious ? WILLIAM HAWKINS Bedford Hills , N. Y. July 4 , 1967 ? Nigeria-Cameroon Relations To the Editor : I have the honor to refer to the article entitled " Eastern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " which appeared in The New York Times of June 21 , and to correct the impr - ssion given by the writer that " Cameroon has gone far further than assuming a ' hands off ' attitude , " with special reference to the suspension of the Protocol Agreement between the Republic of b Nineria and the Federal Republic of Cameroon . I wish to make it clear that the Protocol Agreement , which provided , inter alia , for the free movement of persons between both states without the necessity of a visa , contained provisions that the agreement could be suspended on the request of one of the parties . This was accordingly automatically done on the request of the Government of the Republic of Nigeria . The Federal Republic of Cameroon conforms with the provisions and spirit of the Charter of the Organization of African Unity , and continues to maintain goodwill and friendly relations with all neighboring states and all nations living along its borders , in general , and all Nigerians in particular . JOSEPH N. OWONO ' Ambassador and Permanent Representative to the United Nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1967 ? Brooklyn Project Opposed To the Editor : The proposed Twin Pines Villagecooperative development in Brooklyn 's Canarsie section should be strongly opposed . From the standpoint of environmental design and urban opportunity , the project could hardly be worse . The entire area of north Brooklyn is presently in a state of extreme racial and economic flux . Local citizens and the city and the Federal Governments have committed large amounts of money and effort to revitalize the district 's ghetto areas , and to keep fringe areas economically and racially stable . Furthermore , the borough 's schools , unlike those in Manhattan , have real promise of achieving integration through design because of Brooklyn 's existing land distribution , relatively low densities , racial distribution and percentage of public school pupils . The Twin Pines Village development would have a disastrous effect on these embryonic efforts . It would isolate a large land mass from the rest of the borough by creating a mammoth self-contained community complete even to its own schools . It would go further ? it would tend to draw off tenants from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precisely those districts which government and private citizens are striving to save . This development is especially appalling in view of the city 's past experience with the United Housing Foundation , the development 's sponsor . ' Their " Co-op City " has already created precisely the sort of demographic upheaval and neighborhood destruction which can be forecast for Brooklyn , and the city has struggled hard to obtain grudging , after-the-fact cooperation from the United Housing Foundation in integrating " Co-op City " itself . I Even if all other objections could be resolved satisfactorily , the project location would still be unacceptable . The proposed site is a mere three miles from the end of runways 13-31 at the Kennedy International Airport . Since these runways can not be realigned , the future occupants of Twin Pine Village can expect an environment racked with ' almost constant noise of nerve-shattering level . In reluctantly approving the project , the Mayor asked the City Planning Commission to suggest improvements in the project 's architecture and open space . We find it difficult to conceive of any quality of building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noise . These gross deficiencies do not argue well for the City Administration 's efforts to close the gap between rhetoric and creative action in city planning and design . CLARENCE D. FUNNyE New York , July 7 , 1967 The writer , executive director of Idea Plan Associates , Inc. , is also a member of the board of directors of the National Committee Against Discrimination in Housing . ? No Rifle Subsidy To the Editor : You are mistaken in your editorial of July 5 " Rifle Subsidy " . Civilians shooting at the Camp Perry matches pay for their own room , board and A VISIT Come in , if you will , but then leave soon . Close the door quietly after you , please . Do n't break the silence of my rooms . I would keep The feeling I have deep in me of trees And grassy unconstricted places . I have been To see an old friend . It clings to me , The luster . Tonight the faces of the stars Will burn two degrees brighter because of it . Do n't speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that blue-flowered weed you find sometimes Growing tight in breasts of certain fields , That is , if you kneel and search for it . Come in , But go soon . Great fabled kine are lying down In groups by woods , and rain anoints their hides , Scented , silken . Hush ! I am yet struck dumb By that rareness from which I have lately come .

ADRIEN L. COBLENTZ , M.D. Montclair , N. J. , July 5 , 1967 ? To Lower Vote Age To the Editor : Your July 7 editorial expressed the usual " over thirty " objection to lowering the voting age to 18 . You do , however , admit that any age chosen will be arbitrary . If we must be arbitrary , there . does not appear to be much reason to opt for the older year . Certainly there is little reason to believe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good judgment that make a good voter , " in your words . Exactly what is a good voter ? Years of intensive research have not - answered the question very satisfactorily . If you had in mind as a model voter an objective analyst with extensive knowledge of public affairs , the evidence suggests this is indeed a ' rare type . Comment on Conditions Were we to require a reasonably high level of awareness of public affairs as a prerequisite to voting , the electorate would bt greatly curtailed . It increasingly , appears that the act of voting is primarily an expres7 sion of approval or disapproval . of officials and prevailing conditions . I see no reason for excluding subject-to-draft 18- to 20-yearolds from this opportunity . This is nit to subscribe to the oldenough-to-fight and thus old= enough-to-vote analogy , for like most analogies this one is easily challenged . But many of these youths are caught in a trap ' others are exempt from  --  solely on grounds of age . It makes little sense for the older generation alone to have the opportunity to express @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives . Another reason to approve of the younger age vote is that these are almost the only ones among us who in recent years have had the audacity to point to ' the emperor 's nakedness . And naked he has been on , many of the matters these committed young people have decried . DUANE LOCKARD West Chatham , Mass . July 7 , 1967 ? ? Diminished Justice To the Editor : A civilian has a constitutional right to have bail fixed in a case involving a charge short of murder and likewise , on appeal from such a conviction , where , a court finds an appeal justified . An indigent , convicted of a crime , is now constitutionally entitled to a free and full transcript of , proceedings in theylower could* arid the appointnient of counsel to represent him on . the appeal , without cost .
