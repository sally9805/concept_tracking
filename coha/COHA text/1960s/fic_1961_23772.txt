in a different light . There was one young fellow I knew , he did n't look like anything at all , and yet he got to be a lieutenant . The first time he was in the line I sold him a pair of scissors . No , there is n't much you can tell me about the war . The people who were n't in it do n't know what it was like . Anyone who wants to see that business start all over again is either mad or else he 's a criminal . The way I look at it , one man 's much like another , no matter whether his name 's Dupont or Bismarck . Why should I want to go and shoot at a man I do n't know from Adam just because he was born on the other side of the frontier ? 1 mean it 's childish . He 's never done me an ? harm and I 've never done him any harm . So what 's it all about ? Of course , I know what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germans are an arrogant lot . I agree , and I 'll go one better  --  they 're arrogant and sheepish at the same time . Look at the way they let their leaders push them around . You 'd never get a Frenchman to stand it . And why ? Because he 's proud . And against the government , you mus n't forget that . Although mark you it does n't stop him doing what he 's told . He grumbles , of course , but he marches when he gets the order . Grumbling 's second nature to him . If another war was to break out tomorrow you 'd see all the French rushing to defend the frontier  --  and they 'd start grumbling the minute they got there . Sometimes for nothing at all . Just because they 're against the government . But I 'm not worrying . The Germans can start a war whenever they like , I 'm not afraid of them . I daresay they 'll get as far as the suburbs , like last time , and then our Iads'Il chase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why I 've always thought our two countries ought never to go to war . There are no fighting men anywhere to equal the French and Germans . If France and Germany were to get together nobody could stand up to them and they 'd be masters of the world . Only there 's a snag , because when they 'd beaten everyone else they 'd start fighting each other again to see who was boss . And if you ask me why , it 's just that there 'll always he wars . y O U ' I , L say I have n't many illusions about human nature , and my answer to that is  --  I have n't any at all . What can you expect ? I 've lived . I 've thought . I 've observed the different orders and classes of society . And what does it all come down to ? All it comes to is this , that people are pretty much alike wherever they are and you ca n't change human nature , whetherit 's the cobbler in a back street or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much about fine feathers , not if they 've got eyes in their head . That 's why aristocracy does n't mean anything any more . That sort of thing was all right in historical times , but now it 's progress that matters . Who cares nowadays if you 're of noble birth ? For instance , suppose you see a nice-looking woman in the street or the metro and you give her a look and perhaps a bit of a pinch , as it might be . Well , if she likes the look of you and she 's in the mood she is n't going to go asking for your birth certificate . You see what 1 mean ? Beauty is its own aristocracy , as they say . No one knows it better than I do , being a tailor . I 'll give you an example . Let 's say , for instance , that you bring me a down-and-out off the street , with a three-day beard and his shirt sticking out of the holes in his trousers . You bring him to me here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's see you make something of him . " Well , what do I do ? In the first place I remain absolutely calm . Not a trace of emotion on my face . Not a sound . I look him over and to start with , I get him cleaned up  --  a hot bath to get rid of the lice , barber , manicurist , and so forth . Then I dress him . I know my man . I know his personality right down to his toenails because I 've studied him , you understand . I make him a suit that 's what I call a suit . Iti other words , I dress him . And for no more than a week I take him along to the caf ? morning and evening for an aperitif , just to teach him manners and give him tone . And then what have you got ? You 've got a person you can take anywhere . Claridge 's , Deauville , anywhere you like , and he 'll be able to hold his own . It 's true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not denying it . But the fact remains that a chap that was nothing but a bum the week before last can now pass as a banker or a lawyer or a university professor . It 's a very profound thought , if you come to think of it . These international crooks you read about , that pass themselves off as millionaires or dukes or anything , they do n't worry , they reckon they can look out of the top drawer just as well as the next man . And why not ? A duke 's built just the same as you or me , he does n't have his navel between his shoulder blades . So why should it always be the same lot that are dukes ? But mind you , you must n't go thinking I 'm a Communist . Nothing of the kind . For one thing , I reckon no one ought to go laying down the law about things they do n't understand , All the talk there 's been about Communism , sharing out all the property and bread queues and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in any of it ! Oh , I 've been mistaken about it myself , like everyone else , and I wo n't pretend I have n't . We were bound to be . The public 's kept in the dark , and anyway they do n't use their beads . The fact of the matter is , Communism 's often the exact opposite of what you think . You take Soviet Russia . That 's what I say to the people who want to argue about it  --  have a look at Soviet Russia , I say . They just do n't realize . Soviet Russia 's an enormous country , big enough to hold twenty countries like France . You can travel a thousand miles in it and never meet a living soul . That 's what you 've got to remember , I wish you could hear my nephew Leonard talking about Communism . He 's my youngest sister 's son , a young fellow of twenty-five and passed all his exams and a qualified engineer , that shows you . And he 's a Communist . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualified engineer and a Communist ! But he 's not the talking kind . He lets you do the talking , and he listens , and then all of a sudden  --  bang . Just a wont or two , no more , and he 's flattened you out ! Knate again , you see . Not a hat in the place , not so much as a cap , but my name 's Knate and that 's who I am and you can take it or leave it . Well now , to give you an example , not long ago 1 was at a fashionable dance with my nephew Leonard . I do n't dance much myself , what with being on my feet all day . I sat watching and let Leonard enjoy himself , and after he 'd had a dance or two he came over to where I was , by the buffet . Because that 's what Leonard 's like . When he feels like dancing he dances , and when he 's had enough he stops . He 's got character , you see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking about Communism . I say old , but I daresaythey were n't really any older than I am . They were well-dressed , mark you , and good manners and nice behavior . It does n't take me long to judge people . You 've only got to see the way a man holds a glass and you know if he 's educated . It 's like , for instance , putting your elbows on the table . There are people who think that 's bad manners , but they 're quite wrong . Why there was a photograph in the paper only last night of a banquet of leading industrialists , and they were n't worrying about putting their elbows on the table . Well-bred men too , superior-looking , it 's queer when you come to think of it . Well anyway , there were these two talking about Communism , and the nonsense they were talking you would n't believe . Although it 's only natural . The thing everyone forgets is that Soviet Russia is an enormous country . But you can imagine how it must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were talking  --  a qualified engineer , do n't forget . But he never showed it . He just stood there , not turning a hair , so you 'd have thought he was n't even listening . And I waited . I knew it was corning . And suddenly he let them have it . But calmly , mind you , politely . " Pardon me , " he said , and you could have heard a pin drop . " Pardon me . " And in two minutes by the clock he had them flat on their backs . Two minutes , I 'm not exaggerating . It 's no use asking me to repeat what he said because I could n't do it . The way Leonard talks , well it 's technical language , if you know what I mean , a lot of words you do n't understand and they might mean anything . But it makes you think . Say what you like , there 's two sides to everything . I just leave it at that . As for being a Communist , well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price . You 'll never get me to agree that what 's mine is n't mine and that I ought to be working to support all the dead heats in Paris , not to mention the government . I wo n't stand for that . I 'm in favor of liberty all along the line , but of course there are limits . You may say that our society is n't all it might be , and I agree and I 'm the first to say it myself , but still we manage to get along , and we are n't so badly off at that . It may be that Russia is an earthly paradise , but I have n't been there to see and neither have you . They say that work 's a pleasure there and there 's more time for making love . Well , all I say is , I 'd like to see it . People get ideas into their heads . France has always been full of talkers . Mind you , I agree we have to work too hard . Take me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes twelve and no Saturday after-loon off . And what of it ? Am I complaining ; We all know what they 're like , the ones that are always grousing . So you say I work too hard and you give me Saturday afternoon off . All right , but what happens ? IF I make love on Saturday afternoon what am T to do on Sunday except waste my money in caf  --  s and cinemas ? Where 's the profit in that ? What it comes to is , you think you 're improving things but you are n't really improving anything . T . AT 'S why quite often I find myself wondering whether there may n't be some truth in religion after all . Of course I know you 'll say that no one has ever seen God , and in a sense you 're right . But what I say is , you 've got to be broad-minded about it . You 're entitled to your opinions and I 'm entitled to mine . Every creed deserves to be respected , and no one has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we knew all the things that go on in the monasteries . . . eh ? It 's not for nothing that they keep themselves tucked away . But I 'm not the one to throw stones . There are things that come hard if you 're a normal man , and I do n't mind admitting I 'd never he able to stand it . Come to look at it sensibly , priests are men just like we are . The cassock does n't make the monk , as the saying goes , and there 's a lot of truth in it . And I 'll tell you something that a lot of people do n't realize . Priests are often much more broadminded than you 'd think . For instance , I know a cure , and you could n't wish for a more sensible man . He knows my ideas on religion and I know his . But that does n't stop me respecting him . The day before my daughter went to her first communion , or it may have been the day before that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back room for a glass of fine . And this Abbe Lambin , he sniffed it , and he sipped , and he gave me a wink and he said , " This is bloody good stuff ! " His very words . If only all the priests were like that . But of course you get all kinds . There 's no getting away from it . It takes all sorts to make a world . IF I had any say in the matter I 'd pass a law making it compulsory for priests to marry . I mean , it 's more decent . My nephew Leonard does n't believe in religion either . I 've got to admit I 'm a bit afraid to talk to him the way I 'd really like . The other day , for instance , I happened to remark to him that there are still plenty of things that science ca n't explain , and he just looked at me without answering , as though he was laughing inside . Well , when he gives me one of his superior looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youngest sister 's son . But then again , he 's a qualified engineer , and who am I to compare myself to him , with all his diplomas and all the books he 's read ? What do any of us amount to , come to that ? You take me . Here I am , talking and talking , but it 's only for the sake of talk , because you ca n't always be just watching yourself doing your job . I know I talk a Iot of nonsense . There are times when I even think I ought to try and learn a bit more . Yesterday evening , for instance , my daughter was doing her homework and I picked up her geometry book to see if I could get the hang of it . But it was no use . After two pages . I started to yawn and I picked up the newspaper instead . All the same , it would be nice to be like my nephew Leonard , who knows all the answers . I listen to him when he 's talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's difficult , particularly with the way he takes the wind out of your sails . Last week , when he came to see us with his mother , he said that it was my kind who were responsible for the restlessness of the younger generation . It upset me , as you might imagine . But what would you have answered ? Because if Leonard said it , it was probably right . And those are the times when I wish I was Knate . Because Knate , I daresay he 's no more educated than you 01 me , but he 's Knatc , you see , and that 's enough . " Monsieur , you are under a misapprehension " ? and you put the monocle in your eye and you turn on your heel , and they 've had it . But For most of us , we sort of fumble our way through life on our hands and knees with our noses sniffing the ground . And who stands there looking us over ? Knate ! Standing there with his manner and his monocle . Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like much but has got something in his head . Because , as he says , he 's made the effort to acquire culture . You see ? .. ? Well , good morning , Monsieur . It 'll be ready for the first fitting on Wednesday . The Republican victor-in-de feat  --  finding himself under strong attack from both ends and front self-appointed quarterbacks behind the line  --  has to figure out a strategy to hold the team together for ' 62 and ' 64 . WASHINGTON  --  The Grand Old Party would , naturally , never recline on any psychoanalyist 's conch , and it surely will not gladly submit to any physical checkup by " socialized medicine " either . All the same , the GOP is in need of a conservative clinical examination of a complicated kind : The old boy 's ailment is less organic than ideological . He suffers not so much from wasting tissue or a paralysis of members as from confusion of purpose and ( whisper the phrase ! ) a certain mental disorder . He is victim not merely of a split @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in three ways all at once . Indeed , the obviously great strength of one of the three extant Grand Old Parties  --  the one which nominated Nixon last year and very nearly elected him  --  is in one sense the measure of the weakness of the Grand Old Party . For Nixon did almost too well in not doing quite well enough . So , a party which lost the Presidency by only a tiny whimper now survives with far less effective power than such a large vote would , under ordinary circumstances , entitle it to claim and even force it tn exercise . Nixon , in carrying very nearly half the total popular vote , has not by a long way been able to invest the party-as-a-whole with the influence which this strong showing ought to have given it . For the Nixon partyof-the-center is under challenge from the **29;1640;TOOLONG and the Goldwater party-of-the-right in an internecine struggle which makes the old North-South Democratic guerrilla warfare look as sedate as the Nixon-Kennedy TV debates . Richard Nixon is faulted by the Rockefeller Republicans for not winning an election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home grounds of New York . And he is faulted by the Goldwater Republicans for not winning an election which the Goldwater Republicans  --  with their ideas of " getting tough " with the present while compulsively trying to return to the far past  --  would surely have lost by pluralities so thumping as to recall the gallant and decent Alf Landon 's unhappy experience with the Roosevelt buzz saw of 1936 . Governor Rockefeller hardly waited for the funeral lines to be read over the remains of GOP hopes for 1960 before staking nut his posilion for 1964 . Plainly he is going after the Presidential nomination again  --  a goal toward which he periodically advanced and from which he periodically retreated last year . The new Albany line was laid down early : The Governor considered Mr. Nixon " one of the vital forces in the Republican party " for 1964 . But the Governor frankly just did n't believe that a party which had just lost the Presidency with Nixon really had any " actual head . " Goldwater has taken a similar view . This interpretation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Constitution , can be called an interesting one , at any rate . If the erstwhile Presidential nominee of any party is not its only visible " head " ( admitting that term to be a loose one ) then what was Adlai E. Stevenson from the day after election in 1952 to the night of Kennedy 's nomination at Los Angeles in 1960 ? What was Thomas E. Dewey , one of Rockefeller 's supposed advisers , doing all during the period from 1948 to 1952 , the year he caused the Republican convention to nominate Dwight Eisenhower ? And what of Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona ? In the afterlight of last November 's unpleasantness , some important changes appear to have been made in Senator G. As late as that same month , I reported here that Goldwater had no delusions about Goldwater-for-President , but was only trying to enlarge and harden the conservative to ultraconservative core of Republicanism . The simplest way now would be just to say that I was wrong , and if you prefer you may simply leave it at that . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't , as of then . Goldwater 's disclaimer of personal Presidential ambition was genuine then . It applies no longer  --  he is now with little doubt a real aspirant , in his heart at least  --  mainly because the original attitude was based on his conviction that Nixon would win in ' 60 and that rivalry for ' 64 would be only an academic privilege anyhow . So the position today is this : Nixon , relatively the most successful Republican candidate since the first Roosevelt New Deal save for Eisenhower , the candidate sui generic , is nevertheless in the position of having cannon volleying and thundering at him from left and right .
