txt During June the United States Senate was : ii session nineteen days . In the same month , Senator Barry Goldwater , Republican of Arizona , made twentythree speeches away from Washington . Yet , he managed to appear at eleven of those Senate sessions in June , and to be recorded on fourteen roll-call votes . This feat of political logistics has been matched in recent times by only one other member of the Senate , John F. Kennedy , who was a Senator from Massachusetts during the campaign year of 1960 . It is the view of a good many observers here that both men have been agitated by the same virus ? Presidential fever . Many observers also assert that , next to the President , Senlator Goldwater is the most ex ' , citing and provocative figure on the political landscape today . As the leading apostle of a hard-boiled , unapologetic conIservatism , he has filled the vacuum left by the late Robert A. r " aft  --  and filled it with more dash and political appeal than the dour Mr. Taft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power for his drive . He is generously endowed with energy , charm , ambition , shrewdness and money . There is no clearly discernible brain trust or general staff leading him by the hand to a bright , Right-Wing destiny . But neither is he a " loner . " He has an organizational scaffold on which to work and a few close aides and confidantes on whom he depends for help in his political bricklaying . But as of now , at least , he dominates " Operation Goldwater " and makes it work the way he wants it to work . The key element in this structure is the fact that Senator Goldwater is chairman of the Senate Republican Campaign Committee . He has held this job twice . His present term dates from January , 1959 . His responsibility is to get Republicans rather than Democrats elected to the Senate . This he tries to do by the grant of campaign funds and direct help in organizational and campaign strategy . He is aided in this by a staff of two of the most talented technicians in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Few positions afford a politician more " exposure " to other politicians throughout the country than this . Day by day , by letter , by telephone and in person , he is in touch with the Governors , state chairmen and other leaders of his party who wield the influence that counts when it come time to write platforms and plot Presidential candidates . If he is a good chairman , as Mr. Goldwater is generally conceded to be , he builds " a line of credit " with party leaders in the key states on which he can draw when the need arises . A Sought After Speaker If it sems anomalous that one so conspicuously identified with the right wing should hold this position of high party responsibility , it is worth noting that he is , more in demand as a speaker at political functions than any other Republican in the land ? including former President Dwight D. Eisenhower and Vice President Richard M. Nixon . Invitations have been coming into his office at the rate of twenty a day since January . He accepts , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them as nearly as possible into Thursday-to-Monday week-ends . He has already booked himself for twenty-seven major speeches in 1962 . Roughly two-thirds of his appearances are sponsored by Republican organizations . The rest come from Chambers of Commerce , school and civic groups . The Senatorial campaign committee pays the bills for his official travel . As for the rest , he collects travel expenses only from his non-official hosts . The Senator 's mobility is aided by a private plane and crew nearly always at his disposal . It is an executive type of DC-3 , the property of an old friend and political admirer , Curtis Steuart , Washington business man . While the bulk of the Senator 's expenses are borne by the committee , his exposure on these outings is not confined to party professionals . His chief audience may be a Rotary Club luncheon , or an auditorium full of the dedicated and the curious . Often a day 's itinerary will include a school or college group . Mail Flows In Heavily As a result , he has generated a vast flow of mail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this flow has averaged about 800 letters a day , about 80 per cent of it from outside the Senator 's home state of Arizona . Most are commendatory . Many writers seem to regard him as a sort of messiah of the politically dispossessed , and sonic plead to become foot soldiers in the ranks of his " crusade . " Typical of such letters was one received this week from a young business executive in Cincinnati , who wrote in part : " Millions of Americans are feeling pains of starvation for a spirit of national direction , for a return to some fundamental principles of democracy , liberty and challenge . Will you please advise me as specifically as possible what a young man such as myself can do to help , beginning immediately . " To handle this mountainous correspondence ? as well as the other details of his Senatorial office ? Mr. Goldwater has a staff of thirteen . They occupy a suite of five offices in the old Senate Office Building and two more rooms in the basement . His staff is headed ? in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather formidable personal secretary , Mrs. Edna Coerver , a friend of his school days in Phoenix . Two young men , Theodore Kazy and Tony Smith , are administrative assistants . All office expenses come within his Senate allowance of about $100,000 annually . Too Much Mail to Handle The mail has become so heavy the Senator 's staff is unable to answer more than about half of the daily intake  --  even when using processed form letters for the less important matters . However , the office carefully keeps a card-index record of all names and addresses . A mailing list is an important asset to any politician who expects to stay in ? or expand his  --  business . The Goldwater staff plays a beguiling but hardly convincing game of being mystified and aaive about the furor over their boss . He is not stirring things up , they insist ; he is just being himself , and a lot of people have just happened to discover that he is what they have been looking for . No , they say , there are no I important advisers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and statements himself . " We just run them off on the typewriter for him . " They do concede , however , that there is a " ghost " for the , Senator 's successful newspaper ' column . Syndicated three times a week under the title , " How Do You Stand , Sir ? , " it repeats many of the strongly conservative positions on national and international affairs the Senator makes in his speeches . The column now has 105 subscribers , including such major ' , outlets as The Atlanta Constitution , Denver Post , Chicago 's American , Detroit News , Miami News , San Francisco Examiner and others . Its monthly income of around $1,500 is given to charities in Phoenix . Column Written by Friend The column is written by Senator Goldwater 's close friend and political ally , Stephen C. Shadegg , a Phoenix business man , who also is a mystery story writer and actor and impresario in the little theatre . He is also Republican state chairman for Arizona , although he was once a registered Democrat . The column @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Conscience of a Conservative , " which Mr. Shadegg also wrote for him . It has sold close to 700,000 copies since its publicatioa a little more than a year ago . Whether the ideas of " Where Do You Stand , Sir ? " are more Mr. Shadegg 's or Senator Goldwater 's it is impossible to say . The two do confer once or twice a week by long distance telephone , and also on Mr. Goldwater 's monthly flying visits back home . The prose , however , is that of the " ghost , " as is that of some of Senator Goldwater 's more recent speeches . Another important figure in the Arizona wing of the group is Eugene C. Pulliam , publisher of Phoenix 's two dailies and a sturdy old guard Republican , whom many regard as Mr. Goldwater 's original political patron . A frequent counselor on fiscal and economic matters is Lewis W. Douglas of Tucson , who resigned as budget director in the first New Deal in protest against President Franklin D. Roosevelt 's financial policies . Among Easterners with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another former New Dealer turned conservative , who is now business columnist for Newsweek magazine ; Frank C. Hanighen , publisher o fthe Human Events , a weekly newletter of strongly conservative persuations , and William F. Buckley Jr. , editor of The National Review . Admired by Right Wing Most of the so-called rightwing fringe groups ? including nearly all of those of the " lunatic " variety ? have tried to claim Senator Goldwater as their own . The Senator is wary about encouraging or disavowing this support publicly . Typical , perhaps . is his stock answer to what he thinks of the John Birch society . " I really do n't know much about it , " he says with a studied casualness . " I only know that the few of them I know about in Phoenix are among the finest people in the city . " Such groups are an important factor in the build-up of the Goldwater image as the " savior " of constitutional government . He is quoted and written about admiringly by scores of extremist pamphleteers . publishers and broadcasters across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong hffinity for Brig . Gen. Bonner Fellers , retired . Currently , the general is centering his energies on the Citizens Foreign Aid Committee , an influential lobbying b oraanization aimed at abolIshingforeign aid . To a good many of his Repubblican friends who do not agree with his politics but who welcome his arousing conservative Arizona Senator Has Busy ' Ghost ' The New York Times Republican Senator Barry Goldwater , spokesman for party 's conservative - wing . WIrephato of The New York Times Stephen C. Shadegg , who writes most of the material for Senator Goldwater. enthusiasm , Senator Goldwater 's negativism on foreign policy is the most serious handicap to his own ambitions . " What he needs , " one of them said , " is an Arthur Vandenberg or a Foster Dulles to tell him a few facts of life . If lie goes into the campaign of 1964 talkingthis kind of isolationist foolishness , people will laugh at him . " Well Liked in Senate Washington does not take Barry Goldwater as seriously as the rest of the country . He is universally liked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is not a member of its invisible hierarchy , " The Club . " When he tried last winter to get a place on the party 's leadership conference , along with Senator Everett Dirksen of Illinois and Representative Charles A. Halleck , he was firmly rebuffed . But many party spokesmen agreed that a Goldwater clique is beginning to coalesce within Republican organization ranks around the country . One highly informed person said recently that he would estimate that close to twenty state chairmen . chiefly in the South and Middle West , if polled today , would choose Mr. Goldwater as the party 's Presidential candidate in 1964 . But the Senator has no intention of putting " operation Goldwater " into high gear prematurely . " A lot of people say they want me to run , " he said recently . " I tell them that electing a Republican Congress is more important to us right now than thinking about 1964 . " I tell them that I am not seeking the Presidency  --  and I 'm not . But that 's not a position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wire . You never know in this business what you may have to do . "
