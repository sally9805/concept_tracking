Early on St. Patrick 's Day in 1962 , an armed robber snatched $363 from the Diamond Cab Co. in Baltimore . Hearing cries of " Holdup , " two cabbies trailed the gunman to 2111 Cocoa Lane and called police to the house . Mrs. Bennie Joe Hayden let them in ; upstairs they found her husband undressed , in bed . One cop found a pistol and a shotgun in a toilet water tank ; another found Hayden 's clothes in a washing machine . Though the loot was never found , a robbery eyewitness and the pursuing cab drivers identified Hayden 's clothes , which were deemed sufficient evidence to convict Hayden and send him to prison for 14 years . <P> Simple as it seemed , Bennie Joe 's case raised questions about the Fourth Amendment guarantee against " unreasonable search and seizure . " Last year a U.S. appellate court upheld the Hayden search as reasonable " hot pursuit . " But the court also voided his conviction on the ground that a federal rule barred his seized clothes as evidence . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , federal police were allowed to seize only four kinds of evidence : the loot of a crime ; the tools by which it was committed ; the means of escape , such as weapons ; and contraband , such as counterfeit money . All else was inadmissible as " mere evidence . " In 1961 , ruling on Mapp v. Ohio , the Supreme Court ordered state as well as federal courts to exclude evidence seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment . <P> Property or Privacy ? As the appellate court saw it , Mapp commanded states to follow the federal mere-evidence rule , which stemmed from the idea that the Fourth Amendment protected a person 's private property from seizure . Unless the Government or the complainant could assert a superior interest in the property , said Gouled , the suspect was entitled to keep it . Straining to bypass the rule , courts have since typically barred original tax records or checks as the property of the accused and therefore mere evidence-while admitting photographic copies . <P> Last week the Supreme Court junked both state and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that kept Bennie Joe Hayden in prison and cheered prosecutors across the country . Speaking for the six-man majority , Justice William J. Brennan held that the Fourth Amendment is primarily aimed at protecting privacy , not property . Over a hot dissent by Justice William O. Douglas , * who predicted police abuse , Brennan suggested that the mere-evidence rule did not protect privacy-and it surely prevented police from using the fruits of a reasonable search . Even so , Brennan warned police to maintain Fourth Amendment standards in the seizure of evidence : " Probable cause must be examined in terms of cause to believe that the evidence sought will aid in a particular apprehension or conviction . " At the same time , he reassured prosecutors and police that the Supreme Court has not forgotten that " government has an interest in solving crime . " <P> * Justice Fortas and Chief Justice Warren concurred but quarreled with the breadth of the majority opinion .
