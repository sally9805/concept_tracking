In the tormented life of the playwright Johan August Strindberg , the darkest time fell between the years 1893 and 1895 . The government of his native Sweden- " the land of the nonadult , the disenfranchised , the mutes " - had tried to suppress his work as " blasphemy . " Penniless , he settled in Paris with one summer suit to his name , for summer or winter wear . His second marriage was going badly , confirming his obsessive distrust of women who , he said , " admire swindlers , quack dentists , braggadocios of literature , peddlers of wooden spoons-everything mediocre . " He himself was close to madness -a shabby , shuffling figure who dabbled in alchemy and black magic and once nearly committed suicide . He was addicted to absinthe , but he had one outlet that relieved him even more effectively than alcohol , Strindberg was a painter , and a startling one . <P> Automatic Art . Last week , 27 of his rarely seen oils were on display in the Swabian city of Ulm , the birthplace of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West Germany . The two earliest paintings were rather routine seascapes ; the last eleven seemed to anticipate the expressionism of Emil Nolde . It was the paintings in between that interested art historians most . Just as Germany has its Russian-born Kandinsky ; just as France has Gustave Moreau ; and just as the U.S. has Marin and Arthur Dove , so Sweden now has its entry in the great international game of whose artists got into the abstract act first . <P> Some of Strindberg 's Paris paintings are depressing studies in black , grey and various shades of brown . Others are shrill compositions of hard whites and yellows , oranges and blues , set against a frame of green that is liberally sprinkled with scarlet and purple dots . In one , the colors blend into something resembling mother-of-pearl ; another was obviously begun by rubbing together two pieces of cardboard wet with color to make what Strindberg called " automatic painting . " The show is about to take the grand tour : when it closes in Ulm , it will move to the Museum of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brussels and finally the British Museum . <P> " I Ca n't Explain . " In 1894 , Strindberg described in the avant-garde Revue Blanche his own brand of action painting . " I approach my painting with only a vague idea of what I want to present . Let 's say : the image of a cool , benign forest opening towards the sea . Now I am beginning . With my spatula ( I do not possess any brushes ) I throw on colors , distributing them and mixing them right on the surface . I am mixing many colors , fourteen , fifteen perhaps , evolving a labyrinth of hues and shapes . Finally , the entire surface is swimming in color . I retreat a few steps to look at my work . For the devil 's sake ! I ca n't see any ocean . The luminescent opening in the center has become an enormous perspective of pink and bluish lights . And here-a white and pink spot . I ca n't explain how it got there and what it may mean . "   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
