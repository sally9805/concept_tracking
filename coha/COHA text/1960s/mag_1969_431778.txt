 | Fuel for Your Outboard Mechanics tell a story about a who brought an outboard motor in for ne-up and told the dealer , " You can fix hing that needs fixing , but whatever do , do n't touch that knob on the t of the motor . I 've been adjusting t knob all summer , and I 've got it to point where it 's absolutely perfect . " ourse it was the knob that opens the - r of the motor . There are other ? and more real ? adjustments you can make without ever ng inside the cowl . You definitely st the performance of the motor by kind of gasoline and the kind of oil use . But that adjustment can be illy haphazard if you do n't know t you 're doing . Many of us have been raised e the Del that you should never use anything but unleaded marine white gas in outboard motor . But it 's been getting re and more difficult to find any mae white . That 's going to hit home n harder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the industry , is t the Gulf Oil Co. has discontinued rketing its marine white , which was re widely distributed than others . Actually , the product was discontinued as Iran . 1 , 1968 , although in some areas cks were available through the 1968 boating season . Of course a lot of people have been using automotive gas all along . Even if you do n't fill your boat 's tank at a service station on land , the " marine " gasoline sold at most marinas and gas docks is simply regular-grade automotive gas with an additive to cut down on gum formation during storage . It 's reasonable to wonder what ? if anything ? that automotive gas is doing to your outboard motor . Another homely dictum many people have been living by all these years is that you put a quart of oil in that gas tank along with six gallons of gasoline . That 's a gas-to-oil ratio of 24:1 . But in the last few years outboard motors have been appearing on the market with instructions specifying a 50:1 oil ratio , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out mysterious special oil in cans the size of a beer can , or smaller , and that 's what you 're supposed to put in a six-gallon tank of gasoline . What ratio ? Questions inevitably arise : Can I use the same oil for an older outboard motor , and in the same ratio ? Or , on the other hand , suppose I ca n't get any of that special oil ? do I use ordinary outboard oil at a 50:1 ratio , or switch back to the older 24:1 ratio ? I 've been discussing these questions with engineers who work for the outboard-motor companies , representatives of the petroleum refiners , and other out-  | board experts . There are some clear truths that apply to almost all outboard engines and the inboard-outboard drives that belong to the two-stroke engine category ( Outboard Marine 90-hp. models ) . The gasoline part of the story is fairly simple . You do n't have much of a choice , since marine white is no longer available over most of the country .

Premium gasolines contain a greater variety of additives and more of them . The exception , where it 's available , is unleaded premium gas . But it 's better to use automotive gas . the experts say , than white gas of uncer- tain quality . Such gas is sometimes sold as " appliance gasoline " or " lamp and stove gas . " While some low-horsepower , low-compression engines can run satisfactorily on this fuel , according to Kenneth R. Pike , Chief Research Engineer for Chrysler 's outboard division , most engines will run quite " ratty , " and it can damage more powerful engines . Low-lead light-aircraft gasoline is regarded as good outboard fuel , by the way . Spark-plug damage . Mercury recommends regular-grade automotive gas for Thunderbolt ignition and Polar Gap spark plugs . These surface-gap plugs run at lower temperatures than side-electrode plugs and are much less susceptible to fouling . " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o major disadvantage other than reduced plug life , " said a Mercury spokesman . But in the larger old-model Mercury motors with standard plugs , 1965 and earlier , leaded gas " can lead to damaging pre-ignition . " The problems are inherent in the nature of the two-stroke-cycle engine . Without sepatate intake and exhaust strokes , some of the combustion products are always left in the cylinder . Thus the engine is sensitive to anything in the gasoline or oil that tends to build up deposits . Such deposits can foul spark plugs , or can form hot spots that cause the form of engine knock called pre-ignition . They can also lead to a buildup of varnish or gum in the cylinder , sometimes causing sticking of piston rings and ultimately , if the condition is severe , seizing of the pistons . But all is not lost . When you talk to people in the outboard-motor field about fuel , the conversation shifts rapidly to the question of what kind of oil to use with the fuel that is available . It turns out that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of modifying some of the detrimental effects of leaded gasoline . Outboard oil has also been improved in other respects . What 's so special about the oil ? Evidently it is special- - everyone concerned with outboard-motor lubrication emphasizes that it is inadvisable to use automotive oil in your outboard engine . Automotive oil is designed to last a long time without breaking down at high temperatures , and does not mix well with gasoline . Outboard oil , however , is intended to have a short but happy life ? to mix freely with gasoline and to burn rapidly and cleanly in the cylinder . Many automotive oils are also loaded with additives that are helpful in your car but leave damaging deposits in an outboard motor . The 50:1 outboard oils also contain additives ? but only those that are right for an outboard motor , combined with a clean-burning base stock . The additives are the kind called detergents or disper-@# .  | - sants , so powerful that they can dissolve and clean out engine deposits as fast as they form . Can those cleansing agents make up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mixture ? Combined with improvements in engines that make lubrication more efficient , they can . Better bearings , better lubricant distribution , and improved piston rings have helped to make the 50:1 oils possible . Idling on no oil . It has always been desireable to reduce the amount of oil fed into an outboard motor , for better low-speed performance . Since it 's impractical to vary the oil ratio during operation , the proportion of oil is dictated by lubrication needs at top speed , when the engine is working hardest . At idling or ing speeds , the excess oil fouls spark adds smoke to the atmosphere , and tributes to engine deposits . Tests shown that an outboard motor can satisfactorily at idling speed with no at all . tboard-motor engineers make a distinction between the lean-mix-oils developed by the motor manuarers and those formulated by the oil panies . In a recent research paper , E. Miller and H. M. Pollari of OutMarine said : " Heavy combustionber deposits on both the piston ctor and in the cylinder head are alent when using most commercial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ containing metals such as cal , which combine with lead in the fuel form tough deposits , rather than the re expensive nonmetallic or ashless dis-sants favored by the motor companies.The three major manufacturers , Outrd Marine , Kiekhaefer Mercury , and rysler , all promote their own 50:1 oils . however , an engineer for one of those nufacturers told me his company lly did n't care which of the three nds a motor owner uses . " The three mulas are essentially the same , " he d . " The important thing is to use a 1 oil made by a motor company . " Incidentally , the 50:1 recommendation far from universal . Perhaps the richest xture is the 10:1 recommended by ritish Seagull . For the smallest Chrysler and Montgomery Ward motors , 16:1 is recommended . Mercury still recommends 21:1 for older motors ( pre-1963 ) , but 50:1 for newer engines ; while Outboard Marine advocates the use of its 50:1 oil in Evinrude and Johnson motors of all ages . McCulloch and Sears advise 100:1 with their special oil . Chrysler says a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , racing , and heavy-duty applications . Some racing mechanics play it very safe and feed a 10:1 or even 8:1 mix to specially tuned high-performance racing motors . The differences should be taken seriously and applied with due regard for your investment in your motor , according to the engineers . Small motors with simple sleeve bearings , such as the Seagull , require more oil than those with needle bearings and the like . The theory that older motors have " loosened up " and can get along on less oil , is a myth , engineers say . Today 's oils mix better . The 24:1 recommendation that used to be widespread sometimes included a safety factor to allow for incomplete mixing of oil with gas ; outboard oils today mix better , but plenty of agitation is still necessary . Premixed oil and gas helps in this respect , but you ca n't be sure what kind of oil goes into the mix . The 24:1 ratio is still regarded as a safe bet with oil of unknown quality , even if your motor will take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engine 's performance , whether you 're getting satisfactory fuel or oil ? To some extent you can , the experts say . If the motor is n't running well , sometimes switching to a different oil or gas will produce a distinct improvement . Looking inside the cylinders can provide clues , but it takes experience to spot the difference between harmful deposits and the normal carbon coating on the piston crown . If you 're careless and do n't follow the manufacturer 's recommendations , serious problems can develop . These can sometimes build up until total failure of the power head develops . You can avoid such a crisis , however , by reading your owner 's manual and getting advice from a qualified dealer . @#
