It is a little hard to imagine Lyndon Baines Johnson staking his Administration 's prestige over recent performances by Carroll Baker or Kim Novak . But in the land that produced Sophia Loren and Gina Lollobrigida , the movie industry is seen in a deeper perspective . Last week the uneasy coalition government of Christian Democratic Premier Aldo Moro was threatened with a crisis over censorship of the cinema . <P> Recently the Vatican , mostly through its daily , L'Osservatore Romano , has been lambasting the nudity and immorality in Italian movies . Marriage , Italian Style was bad enough , but a worse offender now is a current boxoffice success called Le Bambole ( The Dolls ) , which features Gina Lollobrigida playing a bored wife who falls for the nephew of a bishop attending the Vatican 's Ecumenical Council . Her ef forts to seduce him succeed only after a daring striptease before the keyhole of his connecting room and a final confrontation at a distant rendezvous , where she awaits him gingerly clutching a bed sheet . This week a Roman magistrate will hale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to answer charges of violating Article 528 of the penal code , banning immoral exhibitions . <P> <P> Hoping to please the Vatican , some Christian Democratic Deputies , over the objections of their coalition partners , the Socialists , introduced an amendment to a bill providing subsidies to Italian film makers . The amendment required subsidized movies to " exhibit respect for the ethical and social principles on which the Constitution is based . " To everyone 's astonishment , the amendment was adopted by a vote of 219 to 195 , with the aid of the Monarchists and neoFascists , but mainly because more than 100 Communists , Socialists and Liberals ( conservatives ) , all of whom were against the bill , happened to be away from Parliament when the vote was taken-possibly at the movies . The bill now goes to the Senate , where the Christian Democrats , Monarchists and neo-Fascists have 150 out of 320 seats , and Premier Moro is in a double bind . If the bill becomes law , Socialist Vice Premier Pietro Nenni may carry out his threat to walk out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moro amends the amendment , back to the bill 's original text , he will offend the Vatican .
