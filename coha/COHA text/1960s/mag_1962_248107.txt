Flame in the Streets . " Jacko , you 've got more principles than a monkey 's got fleas . " That 's what the factory owner says , and any mug at the bench would say the same of Jacko Palmer ( John Mills ) . He 's the best man in the shop , bar none . He 's a hard worker , a faithful husband , a devoted father and a loyal subject of the Queen . But first , last and always Jacko is a union man : first at every meeting and the last to go , president of the shop council since the year dot . What 's right for the union is right for Jacko. and what 's wrong for the union he fights till he sweats till his hat floats . <P> Race prejudice , in Jacko 's opinion , is wrong for the union , a democratic organization in which the color of a man 's skin counts no more than the color of his socks , as long as his dues are paid . So one night when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bloody spades , " old Jacko sees red , and before they can pull their ears in he 's giving them what for in five sharps and never mind the broken windows . Jolly good show . But is it anything more than a show ? How deep are Jacko 's principles rooted ? Before the hot words are cool on his tongue , destiny asks him the trite but inevitable and possibly decisive question : Would you want your daughter to marry a Negro ? <P> Jacko 's answer is apparently intended to represent the answer of the average working-class Englishman : " Lord knows I wish she would n't . But if the poor dear is all that set on ruining her life , I do n't see how I can stop her . As I see it , we shall all have to button up and take the bitter with the better . " The answer , though skillfully expounded by Actor Mills , is less than illuminating , and the film , as a discussion of the race problem in Britain , is less than memorable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reminds a many-colored humanity that the cause and cure of the race complex is everywhere the same . Fear alone builds barriers between men , and love alone can cast out fear .
