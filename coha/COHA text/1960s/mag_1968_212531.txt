EVEN in the most tranquil of times , a federal budget contains much guesswork : spending , revenues and general economic conditions for a period ending 18 months after the calculations are made must be reduced to hard figures . The Administration 's fiscal-1969 budget presented to Congress this week contains more than the usual quota of uncertainties because of war , both raging and threatened , in Asia ; volatility in the domestic and world economies ; hostility to new taxes , and the fractiousness of election-year politics . <P> Lyndon Johnson met these vagaries headon , but the outcome of the collision can not be known for months . He proposed for the year beginning July 1 , $186.1 billion in " outlays " -a term covering expenditures and net lending under the new budget format-but this and other projections rested on expectations of a degree of cooperation from Congress that will most probably be withheld and of only a modest rise in Viet Nam expenses , which are really impossible to predict . <P> <P> Ripples from Pueblo <P> Even before the 1,698 pages got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Reserve forces called up cost $10 million a month while on active duty , and if they are kept in that status , the cost reduction of 13,000 mustered-out servicemen predicted by the budget will be canceled out . What further ripples will spread from the U.S.S. Pueblo can only be guessed at . <P> In any event , military needs continue to dominate federal spending . The Defense Department allocation is $76.6 billion , and related costs such as foreign military assistance and Atomic Energy Commission activities bring the total to $79.8 billion , an increase of $3.3 billion over this year . Total expenditures for Viet Nam are estimated as rising $1.3 billion , to $26.2 billion , or 14 of each $1 in federal outlay . Large as the military figure is , it provides for no dramatic expansion in any segment of the defense establishment . Nearly all the extra funds are absorbed by Viet Nam , higher pay scales , and relatively small increases . <P> On the domestic side , Johnson called for " selective expansion of existing programs , or new programs only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not delay . " In this category he asked for extra millions for the poverty program , ghetto rehabilitation , and expanded employment for the unskilled , as he had promised in his State of the Union address . <P> <P> Jabs That Draw Blood
