RUBBINGS a story by Julia Whedon Every summer it is the same . We arrive shattered , shuffling , like survivors of some mine disaster . Then , not so slowly as one might suppose , the climate , the trivial obligations of rural life , do their merciful work and we are restored . And although this cycle is entirely dependable , we regard its unfolding as pure melodrama . Very gradually our minds , filled with nearly illegible notations scribbled in deadly haste during the winter , begin to transcribe . Thoughts burgeon , cluster , then begin to take on forms we recognize . Then , suddenly , they spring up too close together and we frantically try to thin the tangle . In the winter we beat our brains trying to flush a thought , while in the summer , our arms plunged in cold mud probing for clams , inspiration intrudes , unsummoned . I suppose summers are allegorical . I recall one August we decided to picnic in a cemetery that lay in the heart of a blueberrypatch . Our berry picking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sherbets , jams , syrups , and pies ) brought us repeatedly to the boundaries of the cemetery , but never within . As we set off , the wind was high and hot . Clouds sprinted across the sky . There was a sense of great activity with the seasons about to change . I found that I was taking deep breaths of summer air as if I were about to immerse myself in fall and come up gasping for spring . We drove through the blueberry patch by way of a sandy rutted road . It meandered , not rounding obstacles , just making its lazy way . In the city we are accustomed to terse , direct road systems . They have a self-important way of cutting through all that stands in their path . They assert themselves . Country roads digress . And how delectable it is to traverse the contours of the land . The cemetery crowned a high knoll and from it one had an opulent view of the land around . Being so close to the sea , the land was crude and harshly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vividly , clutching at the sullen moors that lay between us and the sea . The cemetery was old with sinking slanted headstones . Some were worn smooth by time . One bore a macabre Angel of Death . Another showed an hourglass weighted sorrowfully at the bottom . We brought paper and crayons so we could do rubbings later . We gingerly picked our way among the dear departed , then relented and finally settled down upon a Captain Bowdoin and an old maid sister . All about us were notations in New England history  --  childbed fever , epidemics , ships lost at sea , splendid old age . The salient facts of existence were adorned by lichens , dandelions , and clumps of beach plum . That Biblical coming and going , so unremarkable in the country , confronted us like a sermon . Death in the city is so abrupt , untimely , and altogether ugly . It 's part of nothing . It would be fatuous to suggest that a New Yorker had gone to his reward . Once we were settled upon our blanket , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collecting faded standards that had been placed in tribute months before . She thought them very festive and liked their snappy flutter as she raced across the wild grass and flowering weeds . I thought to scold her but I did n't . She would want to know why and it was too nice a day to become fouled in one 's own logic . Lunch was a preposterous collation of peanut butter , cucumber , salami , cupcakes , and Burgundy . But soon every morsel was gone leaving us with a little wine , which we sipped  --  considering the possibility that this was the loveliest interlude in our lives . But this day , as lovely as it was , would have to contend with another in Spain . We had journeyed from Madrid , struggling up the Sierras then out across miles of baked plains when suddenly , there before us , was Segovia  --  appearing from nowhere , like a good idea . So golden and still it was  --  its castle and aqueduct were like dream fragments  --  recalled and then forgotten . We swerved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road . We had meant to tour Segovia but now that seemed like barbarism . We had no heart for it . So we withdrew to a hillside that lay across the river and picnicked in a pine grove . Perhaps it was the odor of bruised pine needles that brought it all back . There is something about eating out-of-doors that makes you feel inexplicably smug . We never did see Segovia and we adored ourselves for it . I 'm conceited I suppose ( my childhood enemies called me stuck-up ) . I 'm likely to make a big thing out of not dropping a Good Humor bag in the street . I take a dim view of the human race and deplore my ancestral connection with it . I guess I was a little precocious in this regard . The fat little boys with weak ankles who wrecked my sand castles thirty years ago are still at it . They leave their loathsome spoor above the tide line ; beer cans , shredded Styrofoam , zoris . How nobly man acquits himself in nature 's struggle  --  everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he , in turn , is consumed by guilt and despair . Well and good . I 'm crazy about justice and 1 like it unequivocal , regimental blue . It seemed to me this August day that I had successfully withdrawn from nature 's gluttony . I was still , quite obviously , thinking the long thought . Sure at last of one point on the compass , I was taking readings in all directions . All ironies and juxtapositions were intelligible to me . I was , frankly , inebriated by the generosity of my own intelligence . What an obligation and privilege it was to be me ! I perceived that my life had a beginning , middle , and end . I was prepared to board my solar ship . Centuries later they would come upon me , with little brushes , and my chattels would tell of my deeds , my wealth , my position . And with these bones and relics they would construe an entire civilization , misplacing me , in time , naturally , by several hundred years . One thought was overtaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My eyes snapped open and my heart ticked a warning . Had I journeyed too far ? I felt like a child awakening in a strange bed . My eyes swept my surroundings . I had , in fact , been dozing and my husband and daughter had discreetly crept away not wishing to disturb me . That was all . I closed my eyes and determined to tunnel back to my thoughts . Yet again I was interrupted . Something was troubling me . A sound cutting in , cutting out . Mentally I swished at it like a cow with flies on her rump . But it persisted . I raised myself on my elbow and looked around again . I was in a bad mood now . For the first time it occurred to me that I was sitting alone in a graveyard . Well , not really alone , of course . Not with George and Emily and all the good folks of Grover 's Corners ghosting around and gassing about the good old days . " Oh world , " I had trilled years before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those were the days . Everything I believed and felt was coinci-dentally expressed by others in lyrics , books , and melody . All the disorders afflicting my aching soul could be diagnosed by reading my diary ( any single page would do ) which , by another coincidence , I always left unlocked . I never handle anything poisonous without imagining myself swallowing it and taking the antidote  --  soap , raw egg , vinegar , milk of magnesia . Similarly , ever since I discovered I had an irrational side to my nature , I 've been practicing rationality ( which both looks and feels tike good posture ) . In this instance , I doused my anxiety with plain good sense . There was n't a reason in the world why a normal , perfectly sensible person like myself should be alarmed . Then what was this dark furry thought stalking my composure ? It was very simple , I reasoned . I was worried about my daughter and my anxiety about her put me off balance . And , in my disequilibrium , my imagination was substituting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter and I stick very close together . In the country she is permitted to wander off . Distance means loss of control . But net in the country . Surely in the country distance meant freedom , integrity , expansion . Not mashers , perverts , and psychopaths . Besides , she was with my husband . It was I that was alone . I was amazed . Generally my apprehension is always for others . But instinct prevailed now . I sniffed the air like a plains animal . My mind was poised , scanning for trouble . Then finally I found it . The blip on my radar screen . A man , youngish , well-built , older than I thought at first . His hair was beach-blown . He seemed to be smiling as he approached . As the distance between us narrowed , he came more sharply into focus . He was too pale to be a local . He was n't shaggy enough to be a hippie . The summer boys all ripped their chinos off at the knee . His jeans were long and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A stranger in a strange place . And no one would linger in such a place unless he was drawn to its strangeness , I surmised . By this simple addition I unheedingly reverted to the logic of the streets . it was as if a light frost formed over the surface of my body , my temperature dropped , and my motor started idling expectantly . Strangers are supposed to speak . He did not . Check . They are supposed to identify themselves , declare their intentions Julia Whedon lives with her husband ( writer Richard Schickel ) and two children in Manhattan ; in the summer they go to Cape Cod . She received a B.A. from Sarah Lawrence , did . graduate work at Harvard , and has had stories published in " Red-book , " " Harper 's , " and other magazines . like ships on the high seas . He had not . Check . There is an invisible line between civil confrontation and intimate encounter . Children and animals may cross it with impunity . The same behavior in adults is highly suspicious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hello , " I said , less in the spirit of a greeting than a challenge  --  a volley laid across his bow . Like a wind-up toy he slowed but did not stop until he reached the very hem of my blanket . He stared down at me , then frowned and turned to the sea , which glimmered hard , not wet , beyond the dunes . " Hey , this is okay , " he murmured in tones I thought one generally reserved for a good back rub . I felt implicated somehow and busily set about packing up lunch . I wanted to appear efficient not frightened . " What a view , huh ? " he said turning to me . He apparently required an answer . " It 's a really swell view . Really neat . " I replied with what I hoped sounded like hearty teen-age enthu siasm . " Come here a lot ? " he queried . " No , never . This is my first time  --  or perhaps should say ' our ' first time . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little walk . " He towered himself , balancing easily in a crouch , and pulled a strand of wild grass from its sheath and nibbled the tender pale end . " You had lunch and everything , huh ? " he said nodding at our leftovers . Well of course we 'd had lunch and everything  --  what in the world was I supposed to say to that ? It made me irritable . Your little girl go along for the walk ? " " Evidently . They 'll be back in a minute , I know . But I must say it makes me very cross . It 's way past her nap time and she whines when she misses her nap . It makes everyone irritable when she whines , and , of course , she 's gone off without her shoes .... " I paired them up and then paused and looked at them hard . I looked up at the intruder . They were just a child 's sneakers but somehow he knew I had a little girl . Then I remembered the buzzing sound cutting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving restlessly about in the distance . We had been watched , observed  --  whatever it was I did n't like it . Where in the world was everybody ? The thought brought me to my feet . I looked frantically in all directions . They were nowhere . The wind poured through the stunted pines in an eternal exhale . My anguish made me pull away from myself  --  I had a dizzying aerial view of the total absurdity of my predicament . Sometime , somewhere , in the last weeks , my exquisitely woven defenses had snagged and had begun to unravel . And to what melancholy seaside revelation did I owe my present peril ? That there is no safety in numbers ? That I could only be diminished by numbers , size , noise , and the ambition of others ? That drowning only occurs on dry land ? In the summer I 'm always conducting cram courses in personal philosophy , recklessly denouncing my own diversions , and finally hurling myself into what I suppose to he the Ganges of self-understanding . I would return , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seashells  --  souvenirs of my inward journey . A regular Anne Lindbergh , except that by January I can never remember what they all mean . Had I gone so far this time that I had abandoned all precautions against the unseen enemy ? I could scarcely believe what I had done . I deserved to lose . As I turned around I thought , " You win . Technically it 's not quite fair . Ordinarily I 'm never found in places like this because I 'm very careful . But somehow I forgot myself . " " Any of these people yours ? " the intruder asked . I just looked at him . Did n't he know I had just capitulated ? He repeated the question . " These people , " I repeated looking at the graves ( I knew I knew the answer ) , " these people . , oh , dear , no . You see , I 'm just a summer person . But the headstones are interesting . You should take a look . Uh , people used to live a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it past childbirth and childhood diseases . There are numerous references , for example , that is , in the inscriptions proper ( maybe I was too boring to rape ? ) . to the sands of time which is not surprising , I suppose , living , as they did , so close to the sea . We know that down through time this has been the case ; people living close to the land have had a powerful metaphorical sense of their environment . It might be said that if you believe in metaphors you 're a primitive ; if you live by them you 're an intellectual . An interesting irony , I think . " I was so dazzled by my own nonstop fatuity I almost missed my chance . My dissertation left my adversary palpably puzzled , if not paralyzed with boredom . That was all I needed . I broke for the car and in a minute I locked the doors , rolled up the windows , and was boiling down the dirt road . The road was mined with sand traps and potholes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tolerate such primitive conditions in the twentieth century is beyond understanding but typical ) . When I reached the main road I felt elated . I laughed out loud . I 'd done it ! All by my goddamned self ! But that was just it , of course . I a story by Julia Whedon 61 was entirely by myself . I 'd left my family behind . I felt as if I 'd made a record run down the Giant Slalom and had just been notified I 'd missed one of the gates . Numb , I turned the car around and headed back in . I had no plan this time . I just wanted my family back . The wind swept across the graveyard as before . The man had vanished . I sat , my hands resting on the steering wheel , and looked at the scene without understanding . It was as if what had happened had never been . It left me flat and tired . My eyes picked up a bright flicker of color darting and lighting in the distance . My husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got out of the car and padded barefoot down the road to meet them . My daughter ran toward me calling , " Mommy , Mommy , " in high excitement . She was working very hard at carrying her pail without spilling . " I got berries ! All by myself ! Look ! We could make lots of muffins . " I looked in her pail . There were twenty berries rolling around in the bottom and my eyes began to moisten with tears . My husband looked at me sheepishly . " With twenty berries ? " I asked . " Well , I figure you could make either one terrific muffin or twenty so-so muffins . " " You ca n't make muffins with twenty berries , " I stated flatly . " You could try ? " he teased me . " No , damn it , I 'm not making any more stupid muffins and that 's that . They taste lousy anyway . " With that . the tears betrayed me and brimmed over . " What 's wrong ? " he asked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off for over an hour without telling me and I could n't find you . Anywhere . Things happened . I was frightened . " I choked out the rest of the story and blew my nose . My husband thought for a moment and then passed me his cigarette . " Strictly speaking nothing happened . You know that , do n't you ? " he said gently . I nodded . " Except one thing . It 's all over for me now . God damn him whoever he was . I have that city feeling now . I can never go places like this again . always know better . " " Mommy , " my daughter said tugging on my arm quietly , " I 'd let you have one of my berries if you wanted . " I kneeled to embrace her , letting her kindness wash over me . " You 'll be the reason I 'll come back , " I thought . I ate one of her berries and got up . " Okay . " I sighed .
