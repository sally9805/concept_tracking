His grandmother lived 101 years and his mother reached 103 . Sebastian Spering Kresge , grounding his hope on heredity and a lifelong abstinence from whisky and tobacco , confidently expected to equal them , and he nearly did . But last week , nine months short of his hundredth birthday , Kresge died of pneumonia and complications that doctors gently described as " old age . " For the founder of the S.S. Kresge Co. ' s far-reaching chain of variety stores , not attaining the century mark was one of the few failures in a long and productive life . <P> About to turn 99 this summer and aware that he was failing , Kresge , with " great regret , " submitted his resignation as board chairman to Kresge 's Detroit headquarters . Son Stanley , 66 , succeeded his father as chairman of a company that is now second in its field only to F.W. Woolworth &; Co. , has 930 variety or discount stores ( against Woolworth 's 3,266 ) . This year Kresge expects to surpass $1 billion in sales for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12.5% is matched among retail chains only by Sears , Roebuck . <P> Traveling Salesman . " S.S. , " as Kresge was called by subordinates , was famed for his penury , which he acquired in the eastern Pennsylvania farming country where his Swiss ancestors had established the small ( pop . 500 ) town of Kresgeville 120 years before his birth . Sebastian 's father was a hard-pressed farmer who had one farm seized by a sheriff for mortgage nonpayment ; young S.S. helped support a later , smaller farm out of his $22-a-month salary as a schoolteacher . <P> After he turned 21 , Kresge gave up teaching for selling . As a traveling drummer in tinware , he saved $8,000 in commissions by the time he reached 30 . One of his customers was Dimestore Pioneer Frank W. Woolworth , to whom Kresge sold a sizable order of tinware . When Kresge noticed that Woolworth 's 19 stores were profitably run on a cash-only basis , the traveling salesman thought he saw his future .

Two years later , Kresge bought out the Detroit store and began his own business . It was an instant success , partly because Kresge was willing to work 20-hour days and put all his money back into the enterprise , partly because he was a whiz at spotting " 100% locations " where all a town 's shoppers passed by . By the time Kresge incorporated the firm in 1912 , he had 85 stores . In 1925 , with 306 stores in operation and a fortune of $200 million already piled up , Kresge moved out of day-to-day management .
