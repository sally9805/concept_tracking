For years No. 8 Schleichstrasse was like any other house on the suburban Bonn hillside called Venusberg . Everything was always spick-and-span , and from the kitchen came the odor of Bavarian stew . No. 8 's occupant , a chubby , rumpled man with pink bulging face and bulging briefcase , went to the office each morning , returned each evening , like so many hard-working businessmen of the district . <P> One morning last week a sleek black Mercedes limousine with official license plates glided up to the curb ; the chauffeur nodded amiably to the plainclothes policeman who had taken up station on the sidewalk during the night . Both beamed as Ludwig Erhard emerged from No. 8 to ride to Parliament and be confirmed as the new Chancellor of West Germany . <P> The Middle Way . It was a great moment for der Dicke ( the Fat One ) . For 14 years , as economics minister , he had struggled alongside crusty old Konrad Adenauer to build a new nation out of war 's rubble , and he had succeeded beyond all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all Europe and can boast a healthy growth of democratic roots . At 66 , Ludwig Erhard is also by far the country 's most popular politician . Meritably , the Bundestag gave him a whopping majority approval to take over from the retiring Adenauer . <P> West Germany 's eagle symbol loomed on the wall behind the speaker 's stand as Erhard rose to deliver his two-hour acceptance address . " My policy is a policy of the middle way , " he declared , making clear that he planned no major departures in West Germany 's domestic or foreign affairs . To the U.S. , he gave assurance of the closest friendship . To Europe , he promised his strongest efforts to strengthen the budding ties of integration . There would be no disavowal of Konrad Adenauer 's Franco-German pact , and he hoped Bonn would remain on warm terms with Paris . But , he added emphatically , " we must also cultivate relations with other European states , especially with Great Britain . " It was hint enough that Bonn wanted no part of Charles de Gaulle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Britain 's entry into the Common Market . <P> Stronger Reality . Erhard gave qualified blessing to the further exploration of an East-West dtente , with the admonition that both sides remember a cardinal need : a solution to the problem of divided Germany . " We are told that division of our country is a ' reality ' which has to be accepted , " he declared . " Of course it is a reality , but it is an unbearable one . An illness , too , is a reality , but no one would think of blaming someone who tries to cure the disease . " <P> Above all , he added , " if the division of our country is put forward as a reality , the will of the German people to restore its unity is a far stronger reality . "
