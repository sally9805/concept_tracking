I 'd Rather Be Rich . There must be some mistake-this ca n't be a good movie . It was produced by Ross Hunter , a man who makes bad movies ( Magnificent Obsession , Imitation of Life ) on principle-the principle that most moviegoers are housewives and most housewives do n't care if the story is dull so long as the furniture is interesting . What 's more , the picture stars Sandra Dee , a young woman who looks like everything the sociologists say is wrong with American teen-agers and acts as though she ca n't wait to get the picture over with and count her salary . <P> Nevertheless , Rich is a good movie-essentially because Producer Hunter hired a talented TV director named Jack Smight , and Smight makes right . <P> <P> He makes , in fact , a continually lively and sometimes raucously hilarious situation comedy in which two hearty old-timers ( Maurice Chevalier , Hermione Gingold ) and two vigorous newcomers ( Robert Goulet , Andy Williams ) really bust up the producer 's fancy furniture and even manage to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kid with the Dee tease . <P> Sandra plays the granddaughter of a dying plutocrat ( Chevalier ) who insists on seeing her fianc before he " joins the Big Board up yonder . " Since her fiance ( Williams ) is fogbound in Boston , Sandra seizes the first presentable passerby ( Goulet ) and tells her grandfather that this is the man she loves . Turns out he is , too , but it takes Sandra 95 minutes to find out she was n't lying . <P> Chevalier is sly and charming as the invalid invalid . Gingold is pure gold as his nutty nurse , a suspicious spinster who sleeps with a large sheepdog in her bed and keeps giving her patient ambiguous invitations- " If you want a pill , " she murmurs , " call me . " Fast company , that , but Goulet somehow contrives to stay with the pace . And Williams , a young singer who looks like Bing Crosby and sounds like several other people , carries off the wackiest sequences in the picture . <P> " What a nice cabin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an assignation . But wait . The place has been booby-trapped by a buddy of Goulet 's . When Andy opens the front door , a full-grown black bear strolls out . When the lovers sit on the couch , springs boing in all directions . When they start upstairs , the stairs collapse . When Andy lights a fire , the house fills up with smoke . When he runs to the well for water , the cap collapses , and he lands in the drink . When he tries to barbecue a chicken , flame shoots out of the bird 's behind and whoosh ! it takes off like a rocket .
