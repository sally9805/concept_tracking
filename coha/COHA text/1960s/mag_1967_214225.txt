Japan 's Mitsui &; Co. , Ltd. , manufactures nothing , retails nothing . It is , instead , one of the globe 's great middle men .

Last year the 300-year-old firm turned an $8.1 million profit by handling transactions totaling $4.5 billion , solidifying itself in the process as the biggest of Japan 's 6,400 trading companies . <P> All-purpose trading companies are to Japan 's economy what the convention industry is to Atlantic City 's .

Mitsui accounts for more than 10% of the nation 's foreign trade , a success story rooted in its corporate history . For generations , the company was part of the vast , family-held Mitsui Bussan combine , one of the powerful zaibatsu-literally , financial cliques-that long dominated the Japanese economy . So much a part of the Japanese military establishment were the zaibatsu that the U.S. broke them up in 1945 . But the trading company itself , under ambitious , soft-spoken President Tatsuzo Mizukami , 63 , has once again made the ubiquitous " Mitsui man " synonymous with aggressive , no-nonsense enterprise . <P> Turning know-how and know-where to the advantage of its Japanese corporate clients , Mitsui &; Co. scours the globe for new technological processes , untapped sources of raw materials and new sales markets . When deals are consummated , Mitsui usually conducts negotiations , then handles details ranging from warehousing to customs clearance to distribution .

By acquiring the necessary patents , winning the interest of Japanese industrialists and arranging financing , Mitsui is almost entirely responsible for Japan 's blooming petrochemical industry . In one of its biggest joint ventures to date , the trading company has arranged to deliver almost a billion dollars ' worth of Australian iron ore to Japanese industry over the next 20 years . And through two dummy companies , Mitsui has established a trading toe hold in Red China .
