This month , like every June for the past 26 years , is National Dairy Month . Even if they do not touch it for the rest of the year , politicians from the President down to city clerks gamely quaff milk in public , and the $11 billion dairy industry unites to persuade everyone to consume more milk , butter , cheese and ice cream . While confronting the public with such unanimity , however , the dairy industry is divided by an argument about a very fundamental issue : Is the industry in trouble or not ? <P> " We are not even holding our share of the market , " says George D. Scott , national chairman of " June Is Dairy Month . " " We are actually going downhill as far as per capita consumption of dairy foods is concerned . " Scott 's argument is backed by some impressive facts and statistics . Since 1947 , the annual per capita consumption of dairy products has dropped from 768 Ibs. to 611 Ibs . The fear of cholesterol and the unpopularity of fat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and many rebellious teenagers , who often regard milk as a symbol of childhood , have switched to drinking coffee , soft drinks or beer . <P> Some of the 13 industry associations that sponsor Scott and National Dairy Month abhor such alarming talk , and turn the statistics to quite a different conclusion . Since the Agriculture Department 's dairy products figures are stated in terms of milk-fat consumption ( and 1 Ib. of butter is rated as 21 Ibs. ) , the Milk Industry Foundation argues that 80% of the drop in dairy products represents butter 's loss to competing margarine and claims that consumption of fluid whole milk has actually increased 10.9 Ibs. since 1947 . <P> <P> Even while arguing with itself , the industry association has begun a $7,500,000 ad campaign to pitch the nutritional value of dairy products , to make milk drinking seem grown up and to convince weight watchers and cholesterol worriers that they have nothing to worry about . ( Margarine makers spend some $22 million a year to convince them subtly that they do , and both sides quote the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxpayer has a stake in the dairy industry 's success . Despite a drop in the U.'S. cow population from 20.6 million ( 1950-59 average ) to 17.3 million this year , the industry 's growing efficiency has nudged production up 5.8% in ten years to an expected 127 billion Ibs. of dairy products this year . Result : the Federal Government will pay out more than $500 million to buy and store the unconsumed surplus .
