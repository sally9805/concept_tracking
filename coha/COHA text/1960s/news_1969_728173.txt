txt The captain of the airliner hijacked from California to Rome was accused yesterday of having acted " irresponsibly " in criticizing an attempt by the Federal Bureau of Investigation to stop the plane here and in portraying himself as " the sole hero of the escapade . " " The F.B.I . did not increase the risk  --  there was a risk of death . the minute the hijacking started , " Albert T. Taub , a Queens Assistant District Attorney who worked with the Federal agents , said . The airline pilot , Capt . Donald J. Cook Jr. , " leaves you with the feeling that but for the fact that Captain Cook acted as he had , the lives would be lost , " Mr. Taub said . " This is an absurdity . It was a team effort . " Captain Cook , in an interview printed in yesterday 's New York Times , called the F.B.I . agents " idiots " and said that they jeopardized the life of the crew members when they moved close to the plane after it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after his arrival in New York from Rome , Captain Cook said he regretted the use of the word " idiots , " but he repeated ? his contention that the agents had endangered the people aboard the plane . The hijacker , Ratfaele Minichiello , had remained in Rome . Yesterday he was charged formally there with six crimes arising from his seizure , at gunpoint , of the Boeing 707 after lilts departure from Los Angeles Friday morning . The action , including a charge of abduction , could block indefinitely his extradition to the United States . It was Minichiello 's possible reaction to the F.B.I . action at the airport Friday that gave rise to Captain Cook 's criticism ' and to Mr. Taub 's countercriiticism-of the captain . According to Captain Cook , the sight of . the law enforcement agents , who were positioned around the plane on the runway , agitated the hijacker to the point where he shot a bullet from his gun . Captain Cook feared that the hijacker would then shoot at the crew , he said yesterday . He therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But , he said , the length of time it took for the agents to move away , and even the presence of agents at all , added up to what he previously called , " damned near a prescription for ' getting the entire crew killed and the plane destroyed . " Mr. Taub , who went to the airport as the representative of the Queens District Attorney , did not believe that the F.B.I . activity had increased the risks ' already facing the three men ' and one woman aboard the plane with the hijacker . " At that point , the only idea , the only intention wee in saving the life of the crew , " Mr. Taub said . Before the T.W.A. let landed- he said , the F.B.I . had planned and tested a strategy for entering the plane . The agents went ahead with the strategy , he said , because " it was possible with the cooperation of the pilot inside to be able to successfully overcome the hijacker without any danger to the people involved . " This strategy was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the F.B.I . office in New York , and James Sullivan , an agent , to enter the plane through a door on its underside and then enter the cockpit through a second door . To get into the cockpit , though , they would need the assistance of the captain , or someone else in the cockpit , who would have to adjust the captain 's seat and help pull the two men up the hatch . They would also need some diversionary action to attract the hijacker out of the cockpit into the cabin . The two men conducted a dry run of the plan , Mr. Taub said , in an identical Boeing 707 craft already at the airport . They did this with the permission of T.W.A. officials , and , when they decided it was successful , they determined to try the same maneuver once the hijacked plane landed . Thus shortly after the jet arrived at Kennedy , Mr. Malone and Mr. Sullivan removed their bullet-proof vests ( to enable them to move more easily ) and headed for the plane . At the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calling to the hijacker to give up . Assistant united States Attorney Raymond B. Grunewald of the Eastern District said Saturday that one of the agents said that he " talked to " the hijacker as a diversion . Both Captain Cook and Mr. Taub , though , said there was no conversation between the agents and the hijacker . ? The affidavit submitted to the United States Attorney , though , did say that the efforts of the three agents who tried to divert the hijacker by calling to him to surrender " were of no avail , culminating in the firing " by Minichiello of his rifle . After the firing , according to the United States Attorney , the agents backed away . Mr. Malone raised himself through the first door , Mr. Taub said , but was unable to get through the second , to the cockpit , because he received no assistance from anyone inside the cockpit . At this point , he turned back , and shortly thereafter , the agents moved farther away from the plane . " I 'm not blaming the pilot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activity had succeeded , he said , or if the captain could have persuaded the hijacker to leave the cockpit , this plan would have enabled the F.B.I . agents to take the hijacker . " The F.B.I . made an attempt to get the full facts of what was happening inside , and what if anything they could do , " Mr. Taub explained . According to Mr. Taub , the F.B.I . plan , though it ultimately failed , did not , when conceived and when carded out , entail any additional risk to the crew . Criticizing Captain Cook 's accusation that such additional risk was incurred ; Mr. Taub said : I " He is in an emotional state . He has no experience as a law enforcement officer . He has no idea if the risks were increased . He only knows that his fear was increased  --  that I 'll agree to . Pilot Explains Statement The captain conceded that he had made his charges in somewhat of an emotional state . Asked at the airport if he had called the F.B.I . agents " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was " after being up for 40 hours and having a couple of glasses of wine with my dinner . " Then , saying that he did not think the F.B.I . agents had endangered the crew " intentionally , " he remarked : " I do n't want to shoot at the F.B.I . because in this business they are a man 's best friend . " The pilot did say , though , that " they the agents crowded us a little too far " and , when asked if he had any words to say to the F.B.I. , that " maybe a few words to them on the authority of the captain might not be out of order . " The F.B.I . had no comment on Captain Cook 's statement . F. C. Weiser , president of T.W.A. , who introduced the pilot and his three fellow crew members after their arrival in New York yesterday afternoon , defended the F.B.I . " They know how to do their job , " Mr. Weiser remarked , and said that the agents were required to ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hijacker would " blow his top . " Captain Cook 's earlier complaints about the F.B.I . brought little criticism from his crew or his fellow pilots . Ray Gerber , a Pan American pilot who is vice president of the International Federation of Airline Pilots Association , said yesterday : " If what Cook said is accurate , I think the complaint may he justified . " And Tracey Coleman , the young stewardess who was on the flight throughout its . California-to-Rome trek , stood before the press yesterday afternoon , clutching a bouquet of cellophane-wrapped roses , and explained her ? own feelings about the incident at Kennedy : " I was very sure he would shoot all of us if the F.B.I . was n't moved out .
