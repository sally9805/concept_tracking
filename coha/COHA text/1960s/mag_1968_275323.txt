Like all totalitarian regimes , the Soviet Union attempts to seize and shape the minds of its young at an early , formative stage . For the group between the ages of 14 and 28 , the instrument to that end is the Communist Youth League , or the Komsomol . Last week , as early snow and biting cold embraced Moscow , thousands of Komsomoltsy marched through the capital to celebrate the 50th anniversary of their organization and to pledge , amid red banners and slogans , unsparing efforts in the struggle for Communism . <P> The Komsomol boasts a proud heritage . In 1918 , when Russia 's civil war was at its height , the fledgling youth movement gave the Bolshevik cause some of its most dedicated fighters . Their role earned them Lenin 's encomium as the " shock forces " of the revolution . There were 22,000 members then , people drawn from schools , factories and farms . They considered themselves " an active , creative force in society , the party 's helper and its reserve , a school of Communism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Komsomol claims 23 million members , busy at activities that span the range of Soviet society . Since 1950 , more than 1,800,000 Komsomoltsy have given up summer vacations and sometimes whole school years to work on development projects in Siberia and the Soviet Far East . Komsomoltsy helped build the Bratsk hydroelectric station , are now participating in the construction of the Togliatti auto plant , which is scheduled to produce 600,000 Soviet versions of the Italian Fiat a year . Some of the youngsters go out of ideological zeal , some simply for the adventure of getting away from home . But for most , subtle and highly persuasive pressures are at work , primarily choice job assignments after graduation that can be allotted in part according to a Komsomol pl record . Still others invest a summer in Siberia in the hope of avoiding more permanent assignment to the boondocks later . <P> The need for such temporary work in industry is diminishing : an increasingly sophisticated technology has cut down the need for unskilled labor with the result that at projects like the Togliatti plant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are still needed in the back-breaking work of the annual harvests . Beyond such extracurricular efforts , Komsomoltsy have a voice in their own student affairs and maintain their own job placement service . <P> Lofty en Garde . Yet despite these wide-ranging activities , there are signs that the Komsomol is losing its appeal for many Soviet youth . There is no war and no revolution to chal lenge the present generation , and many young Russians find indoctrination a bore . The growing dissent and dissatisfaction in Russia doubtlessly have infected the Komsomol , along with other elements of Soviet society . Party Secretary General Leonid Brezhnev underlined the leadership 's concern when he told Komsomoltsy in his 50th anniversary speech : " Class enemies disguising themselves as the friends of youth strive to draw politically unstable , inexperienced young people into their nets to blunt their class and revo lutionary vigilance with false arguments of a bourgeois liberal nature . " After that lofty en garde , Brezhnev complained about the poor showing of Russian youth in the Olympics .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
