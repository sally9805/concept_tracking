Three months after being elected Pope , Paul VI announced that he intended to modernize his Curia , the Vatican 's 1,000-man bureaucracy , by bringing in younger clerics , including many more non-Italians . Last week the Pope took a major step toward that goal when he accepted the resignations of two venerable members of Rome 's Old Guard . <P> The more notable retiree is Alfredo Cardinal Ottaviani , 77 , the near-blind head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith , the church 's chief agency for rooting out heresy . Although a kindly man in person , Ottaviani was a symbol of repressive Catholic conservatism and a leader of the stand-fast minority at the Second Vatican Council . Ottaviani 's successor is Yugoslavia 's Franjo Cardinal Seper , 62 , the Archbishop of Zagreb . As his country 's unofficial primate since 1960 , Seper ( pronounced " shaper " ) has pursued a course of accommodation with Tito ; at the recent Synod of Bishops in Rome he was overwhelmingly elected by his fellow prelates to head its commission on theology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 80 , the traditionalist head of the Congregation of Rites . At the same time , Giacomo Cardinal Lercaro , 76 , the Archbishop of Bologna , resigned his additional duty as head of the Council-created consilium for liturgical reform-thereby allowing the Pope to combine the two overlapping jobs and give them to another non-Italian : Benno Cardinal Gut , 70 , a Swiss Benedictine abbot who favors more changes in the Mass.
