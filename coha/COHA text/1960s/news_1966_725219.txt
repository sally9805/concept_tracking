Right to Bargain To the Editor : The T.W.U. has rejected the Mayor 's proposal that the dispute be submitted to arbitration . The union sees arbitration as a threat to collective bargaining , and they are right , for repeated arbitration is the death of collective bargaining . Yet the right to bargain collectively can not remain unchallenged : it implies the right to strike and the possibility of large costs to the public . The right to strike assumes that the costs will be borne by the parties to the conflict , as is the case in most industrial disputes . The public interest is minor when customers can postpone purchases , stockpile in advance or do without . These alternatives are not available in the present instance , and the public interest is the dominant one . One aspect of the transit dispute makes it difficult to settle . The limits of bargaining in disputes in other industries are usually well defined by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in demand over the life of the contract . The revenues of the Transit.Authority are difficult to anticipate , since they may include larger subsidies from general public funds . Settlement Slowed The size of the pie which is to be shared is unknown . The diffuseness of the limits encourages extreme positions by both the union and the T.A. , which prevents a quick resolution of the issues . The right to strike and therefore the right of collective bargaining can be guaranteed only if the public interest is ignored . The Condon-Wadlin Act recognizes the problem , but it is ineffective because it deprives workers of the right of collective bargaining without supplying an alternative form of wage adjustment which is acceptable to them . The injustice of the act results in its being virtually ignored and used only in a desperate , futile manner . The solution must be based on the recognition that collective bargaining is impossible in industries where the public interest is urgent , and workers in such industries must be assured of fair treatment . A possible approach would include a legal prohibition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rates will rise annually by the same percentage as wage rates in unionized industries generally . Grievances can be handled by arbitration . Hours , vacations and other conditions of work can be based on practices in other , similar industries . DAVID SCHWARTZMAN Professor of Economics New School for Social Research New York , Jan. 6 , 1966 ? City 's Generosity To the Editor : As one who was born and brought up in New York City and moved with others to the suburbs , I have come to see a gross injustice to the city , particularly in times of crisis and breakdown . New York City accepts and struggles with responsibilities which no other place in the world will recognize . Whether it be an issue of education , welfare , housing or even inexpensive transportation , New York struggles against almost insurmountable odds to do the responsible thing . For this dedication it should be very proud . Who among the critics and detractors of the city would ever make the incredible commitment to any and all people that so characterizes New York ? If this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would carry this human burden ? We in the suburbs . clearly feed off this giant . We take everything it has to offer and give very little , not even understanding , in return . When New York City has problems , we smile with self-satisfaction . We forget that only a place that attempts to respond to human need so generously can ever look quite so foolish . The meaning of greatness within a city or a person is the willingness to accept a human responsibility With no thought of the risk , the pain or the impossibility . PAUL Z. FRISCH Great Neck , L. I. , Jan. 5 , 1966 ? Coverage of Quill To the Editor : The behavior of news and cameramen as they interviewed Michael Quill at the Americana Hotel on Jan. 4 was enough to give anyone a heart attack . Not that I am rooting for Mr. Quill  - -  far from it ! But the show produced by our communications for the benefit of millions of television viewers was bedlam itself  --  and certainly not a service to our City of New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trampled each other in an attempt to get closer to Mike , the- great hero of the moment . Finally , to allow TV coverage , front-row cameramen fell on their knees in a circle at the feet of the vituperative little hero , a fitting climax , as he made his Act III curtain speech before being carted off to jail in the paddy wagon by the villainous sheriff and his lackeys ? in this riverboat melodrama . How beautifully the press has cooperated with Mr. Quill in turning this serious dispute into a farce as he has strutted across the stage calling the cues ! Although I am a stanch advocate of our legacy of freedom of the press , it seems that such a heritage should be treated with the dignity and respect it demands . The spectacle at the Americana was a disgrace to this tradition . LYNN DILLON BUCK Upper Nyack , N. Y. , Jan. 4 , 1966 ? Wagner Criticized To the Editor : Your editorial accolade ( Dec. 31 ) " Thanks to Mayor Wagner " was hasty and misconceived . Had you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible to write that Mr. Wagner " has been a fundamentally decent , honest , compassionate man who never spared himself in serving his city . " How can the words " decent , " " honest , " " compassionate " be used in the context of Mr. Wagner 's antics during his last hours in office ? By his appointment of Norman Winston to the Triborough Bridge Authority so as to insure an anti-Lindsay majority in that agency ? By freezing some key positions in the city and on the bench , designating for those spots a number of undistinguished persons whose conduct in office may well be calculated to diminish the luster of Mr. Lindsay 's vision of a " proud and better city " ? By the dubious nature of Mr. Wagner 's relationship with Michael Quill ? By his departure for Mexico 24 hours prior to the expiration of his term ? By leaving the city in a mess that might make Mr. Wagner look good in retrospect ? These are the acts of a cold . selfish politician , not of a decent , honest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have recalled these words from Sophocles 's " Antigone " : It is no easy matter to discern The temper of a man , his mind and will Till he be proved by exercise of power . ABRAHAM WILSON New York , Jan. 1 , 1966 ? Value of Public Library To the Editor : A correspondent suggests in your issue of Dec. 30 that the financial problems of the New York Public Library should be eased by restricting the use of its books " to those individuals who appear with suitable credentials . " When I came to New York a quarter of a century ago I had no credentials , and no one in the library asked me to prove that I was worthy to use it . I did the research for all my biographies there , and I owe the library a debt I can never repay . The library trusts its readers . I hope that we , in our turn , will be worthy of its trust and that it will never be forced , through a lack of funds that would be our fault @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MARCHETTE CHUTE New York , Jan. 1 , 1966 ? To Retain Stuyvesant High School To the Editor : The plans of the Board of Education to abolish the special status of Stuyvesant High School as a special school for intellectually gifted children is contrary to our national aims for better education . These children who are admitted to Stuyvesant High School on a competitive basis need the constant challenge and stimulation of their school in order to develop their intellect . Without this challenge , many will lose interest and find frustration in boredom . It would be a serious blow to democracy if only rich parents could afford superior education in private schools for their children . For the last sixty years Stuyvesant High School has served our city well , and many of its graduates became famous men , thanks to the excellent education that Stuyvesant High School had offered them free of charge . It would be inconceivable that the standards of education in this city should be lowered at a time when our entire nation is striving to upgrade them . No community can afford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help it develop . We are spending a large share of our national budget , of our state and city taxes to improve education . Let us not thwart these efforts by closing the doors of one of the finest schools in this city . Please allow me to add my voice to insure that Stuyvesant High School remains this high citadel of learning whose alumni will give us pride in the years to come . ALFRED S. WORTSMAN Jackson Heights , L. I. Jan. 3 , 1966 ? For Negotiation With Vietcong To the Editor : The most important item in The Times of Jan. 4 is the news report from Rome of the Pope 's approval of the cessation of bombing and his admonition to the President to " neglect nothing which might produce a meeting of minds . " With all the jets flying in so many directions , one would think that the time and energy ' could be found to get a message to the principal belligerent , the de facto regime that calls itself the National Liberation Front and that we call Vietcong . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lend himself to what Hanoi calls " a noisy propaganda campaign " unless he were convinced that he had authority to act if an opportunity to negotiate presented itself . Yet it is very puzzling that no direct approach has been made to the de facto government of a large portion of South Vietnam , which commands according to every account from 75 per cent to 95 per cent of the troops in the field against the troops that General Westmoreland commands . Queen Victoria 's Government supplied more to the American Confederacy , I dare say , than Hanoi has to the N.L.F. Yet Grant was quite willing to deal with Lee . HOWARD N. MEYER Rockville Centre , L. I. Jan. 4 , 1966 ? Interfaith Unity To the Editor : It is said of Plato that he reprimanded a guest who criticized the mispronunciation of a word by the slave who was reading to the two Greeks at breakfast . " We know what the word means , " Plato said . " Why stop for improving his pronunciation ? " Someone should speak thus to Rabbi Abraham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activity is on the rise throughout the world , why niggle over the definition of ecumenism ? GERSON GOODMAN White Plains , N. Y.
