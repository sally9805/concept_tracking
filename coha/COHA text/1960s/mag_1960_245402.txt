For the experts who are trying to determine where the U.S. economy is going , the clues last week were like the first four-fifths of a mystery novel : challenging but pointing to no clear solution . Some who looked at the overall economic figures found reason for gloom in their further decline . Others who studied the earnings of individual businesses found the picture not nearly so clear-cut , the gloom not nearly so pervasive . <P> Total personal income rose slightly to hit a record in September , but the rise was deceptive : most of it was due to increased social security , unemployment and veterans ' payments , while wages and salary income fell $400,000,000 because of drops in employment and working hours . September retail sales fell about 1% from August , hovering only 1% above strike-ridden September of 1959 . For the second month in a row , U.S. industrial production slipped in September , falling a point to a 1960 low of 107 of the 1957-based index ; the August decline , in turn , was revised downward to two points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the three-point drop in two months was almost as sharp as monthly changes during the early stages of the last recession in 1957-58 . Reflecting the uneven pace of the U.S. economy , there were declines in the output of steel and other primary metals , while production advances were chalked up by autos , TV sets and home radios . <P> <P> Growth Areas . The slowing in the economy means that overall third-quarter corporate profits will be down from the second quarter ; many a company was so reporting . Yet companies situated in strong growth areas-particularly those that deal most directly in essential goods and services to the consumer-are enjoying better business than ever . The biggest U.S. business , A.T . &; T. , installed 700,000 new telephones in the third quarter to push the total in use past 60 million . The number of long distance calls climbed 6% . The result , announced A.T . &; T. President Frederick R. Kappel , is that his company 's earnings rose 10 per share from last year to $1.40 for the third quarter . <P> Third-quarter earnings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share v. 44 last year . Spurred by what Chairman Neil McElroy called " the rather exceptional progress " being made by Procter &; Gamble 's Duncan Hines cake-mix sales , P. &; G. 's estimated third-quarter sales and earnings were going along at about last year 's 5% growth rate . <P> The quest for new products and more efficiency was a boon to some companies , a temporary check on the earnings of others . Benefiting from the office automation boom , IBM profits soared $5,000,000 in the third quarter over the same period in 1959 , lifted per-share earnings for the nine months to $6.51 v. $5.57 last year . Aided by 70% load factors on its new jets , which now carry 56% of United 's passengers , United Air Lines made a steep climb ; President William A. ( " Pat " ) Patterson announced record third-quarter earnings of $1.97 per share , up from $1.74 a year ago . Ford , riding the compact crest , announced an extra quarterly dividend of 30.             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
