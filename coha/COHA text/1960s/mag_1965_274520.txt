SOUTH KOREA <P> In terms of America 's role in Asia , a series of striking parallels exist between South Viet Nam and South Korea . Both are segments of former colonies-one French , the other Japanese-divided arbitrarily north from south between Communist and free regimes . Both were invaded by their northern neighbors at the urging of Red China ; both were-and still are-defended by the U.S. The Korean War ended with a negotiated truce that left 50,000 U.S. troops permanently on station in the south to prevent any subsequent Communist aggression . Those who think that the U.S. position in Viet Nam today is futile or " immoral " should take a look at South Korea . <P> This week as South Korea 's President Chung Hee Park visits in Washington , his nation is moving toward economic takeoff , the scars of war are nearly healed , and a viable ( if still somewhat fragile ) democracy is emerging . New office buildings rise over the war-battered roofs of Seoul , and a new bridge spans the Han River-four times fought over in the course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goods from American PXs are stocked to bursting with local wares , ranging from handbags and Silla Dynasty bowls to hand-woven Korean silk and brocades . In the southern port of Pusan , bonded processing factories turn out pants , sweaters , blouses and children 's clothes for the U.S. market ; other plants make electric fans , telephones and transistor radios for export to Southeast Asia and the West . At Ulsan , a $20 million oil refinery-jointly built by the government and Gulf Oil-is producing 35,000 barrels a day while other private U.S. capital is invested in everything from $10 million fertilizer plants to a $180,000 mink ranch near Pusan . <P> Old Dodge , New Tricks . Still , a typical city worker earns only $24 a month , and although the runaway inflation of last year has been largely checked , it remains a persistent threat . Nearly a third of the 1965 budget will be supported by U.S. commodity imports , but U.S. aid-$4.1 billion since 1945-is being reduced , and the shift is away from direct grants to long-term development loans . Self-sufficiency for South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it hinges largely on continued political stability . <P> The man responsible for that is President Park , 48 , the tough , taciturn little general who seized power in a military coup d ' tat four years ago . Since his emergence as an iron-jawed , hardhanded dictator , Park has won Asian respect by moving slowly but surely toward civilian rule . Though he was elected to the presidency by a mere 156,000 votes in 1963 , Park 's Democratic-Republican Party now controls 110 of the Assembly 's 175 seats , keeps the opposition Popular Party ( 62 seats ) well in hand . But the dangers common to Asian democracy remain endemic . Last week , before taking off to Washington.Park reasserted his hard hand by crushing an incipient coup that had been mounted by 20 disgruntled army officers .
