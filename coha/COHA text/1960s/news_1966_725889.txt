txt Working with the juice of fresh-cut spinach , two California scientists are believed to have taken mankind a big step closer to the use of sunlight for the production of nourishing foods out of such waste plants as jungle leaves and grass . They have been able to duplicate the photosynthesis process outside a living cell to a degree that is regarded as insignificantly different from that taking place naturally inside a living cell . Photosynthesis is the process in which the sun 's energy is used by green plants to manufacture proteins , fats , sugars and starches , while at the same time giving off free oxygen to the atmosphere . The process is one of nature 's fundamental activities , taking light energy from the sun and converting it into chemical energy that plays a major role in helping plants to grow . The scientists who succeeded in the new experiment are Dr. James A. Bassham , a chemist on the staff of the University // ? of California 's Lawrence Radiation Laboratory , and Dr. R. G. Jensen , a post-doctoral fellow of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work was supported by the Atomic Energy . Commission . The two men were not the first to carry out a photosynthetic reaction outside a living cell . Prof. Daniel I. Almon and his co-workers , also working at the University of California . accomplished that feat in 1954 . But the Bassham-Jensen experiment was nevertheless termed " a major milestone " by Dr. Roderick K. Clayton of Cornell University , a leading authority on photosynthesis , because it brings research in the field to the point where scientists can duplicate outside a cell almost exactly the process that takes place inside . In addition , Dr. Bassham and Dr. Jensen said they had succeeded in identifying two major control centers in photosynthesis 's so-called carbon cycle . Identification of these points should , it was felt , eventually enable scientists to manipulate them and , may force a leaf , for example , to produce more nourishing protein and less useless starch . Drs . Bassham and Jensen reported their work in a paper published in the October issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried out photosynthetic activity at an intensity rate that is two-thirds of that occurring in living cells . Dr. Arnon 's original experiment produced a 5 per cent rate . Part of the great improvement can be traced to a scientific rejection of the commonly accepted idea that spinach is simply spinach . Drs . Bassham and Jensen grew their own spinach under carefully controlled conditions and then broke the cells apart with great care to obtain the material with which they worked . Previous experimenters , Dr. Bassham said yesterday in a telephone interview , used storebought . spinach that had lost much of its freshness . The spinach used in the experiment was broken down gently in a household blender . Then the spinach juice was whirled in a centrifuge to break , apart the individual cells of the leaves . Finally Dr. Bassham and Dr. Jensen extracted the part of the cell known as the chloroplast . This is where the photosynthetic reaction takes place . The idea of the experiment was to isolate the photosynthesis process , which is in itself extremely complex , from all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That kind of isolation enables scientists to investigate fundaThe two men took the choloroplasts and suspended them in a solution known as a buffer . This is a liquid that provides the kind of environment in which photosynthesis can take place . Then by simply turning on a light , they initiated a photosynthetic reaction . Now they were ready to investigate the carbon cycle . The Lawrence Laboratory has a long tradition of research into the mysteries of the carbon cycle . In 1961 . Prof. Melvin Calvin , under whom Dr. Bassham exposed the solution , with the spinach chloroplasts in it , to light . Next they turned off the lights , stopping the reaction at various points in the cycle . Each ' time tfiey stopped the reaction , they ' separated the chloroplasts from the buffer and by tracing ! the radioactive atoms they determined just what side compounds had been made , photosynthetically : By measuring how much of each of the compounds they hadl in the buffer and how much in the chloroplast at any given , time , by judging the effect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chemical inhibitors , the two scientists were able to pinpoint the control mechanisms and the places in the cycle where they worked . Dr. Bassham discussed the reasons for the use of spinach in the . experiment , saying it was traditionally used in such work sluice it was easy to cut thin slices , could be chopped up easily without damaging the chloroplasts , was generally available and has a high rate of photosynthesis . Yesterday Dr. Bassham speculated on just how scientists could manipulate photosynthesis at the control points in the carbon cycle . Airplanes might - spray a chemical over a jungle to make . leaves grow less starch and more protein , he said . The chemical might be what scientists know as a " fatty acid inhibitor . " Dr. Bassham made no claims that a world of good and plenty was around the corner . Scientists , he said , must still figure out much of how nature works in photosynthesis and devise ways of applying it .                  @ @ @
