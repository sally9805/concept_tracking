As a World War II prisoner held near Concordia , Kans. , German Afrika Korps Lieut . Reinhard Mohn developed a command of English and an affection for American ways . Mohn returned to Germany and took over his family 's small 111-year-old C. C. Bertelsmann publishing company , read all that he could find about U.S. management ideas-and made the firm the colossus of the West German book business , ten times larger than its nearest competitors . Lately he has made himself West Germany 's movie king as well . He has bought the famed but financially troubled Ufa studio , and last month he acquired a 50% interest in Munich 's Constantin Filmverleih , the country 's biggest film distributor and producer . It specializes in grinding out Wild West films in the Yugoslav mountains . <P> Broadening Choice . Mohn grew rich by adapting to West Germany a U.S. success : the mass-market book club . He persuaded the closely bound fraternity of 5,000 book dealers and door-to-door book salesmen to solicit memberships by offering the solicitors plump 41% commissions on each volume sold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concentrated on small editions of intellectual literature , Mohn brought out volumes with mass appeal from encyclopedias to schmalz . Applications rolled in-80% of them from young people who had never before read books outside of school . Mohn now has four clubs for books and records , and a membership of 3,200,000 , including Chancellor Ludwig Erhard . This year he will put out 22 million books and write up sales of some $80 million . ( The U.S. 's largest book publisher , **25;32;TOOLONG , last year had sales of $113 million . ) <P> Bertelsmann grew so fast that a few years ago it wobbled . " Our old patriarchal form of management collapsed , " says Mohn . " We were practically forced into decentralization . " With techniques gleaned from U.S. magazines and books and his biennial brain-picking visits to the U.S. , he split Bertelsmann into 44 subsidiaries , each with its own boss and its own specialized function , such as printing , warehousing and collecting bills . Delegating with skill , he told managers : " I do n't care what you do-as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best solution to his particular problem . " Whenever a subsidiary shows signs of a sloppy performance , Mohn himself steps in and takes over . <P> Rejecting Controversy . In his own reading , Mohn , 44 , confines himself to books on business ( notably those of U.S. Management Consultant Peter Drucker ) and the eight books a year " most recommended " for his book clubs . The members , with growing sophistication and independence , are tending to ignore the clubs ' recommendations : the number making their own selections has risen from 20% in the early postwar years to 77% now .
