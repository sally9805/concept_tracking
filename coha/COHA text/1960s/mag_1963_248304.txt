Though every German soprano worthy of her breastplate has sung the role of the Marschallin in Strauss 's Der Rosenkavalier , other singers keep a respectful distance . The Marschallin 's notes are within easy reach of the best sopranos , but dramatically her role is too restrained for Italians , too aristocratic for Americans , too Viennese for the French . Last week though , a French soprano named Rgine Crespin sang the final Marschallin of her first season at the Metropolitan Opera . It was the best at the Met since Lotte Lehmann 's swan song 16 years ago . <P> Head &; Heart . When Crespin made her Met debut last fall , a critical audience was as startled by her temerity as it was pleased by her voice . Lehmann herself-the peerless Marschallin-had returned at 74 to coach the new singer , but Crespin clearly had ideas of her own . " We have met an impasse , " Crespin said , then went onstage to offer a compromise interpretation of the role that even Lehmann had to admire . True to her introspective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first act at fingertip touch , hiding her immense voice behind a melancholy that was queenly and cool . Only in the final act did she display the full range of her vocal power ; when she did , she reached the Met 's distant chairs with astonishing clarity . <P> Good French singers are as rare as good French boxers , but Crespin is the grand exception . Born in Marseille in 1927 , she made her debut at the Paris Opera at 24 in Lohengrin , and the German repertory has been her forte ever since . Audiences at Bayreuth and Vienna have been astonished by the precision of her diction , a triumph Crespin considers her most significant . " When I have a success , " she says , " it is a double one . I always have to fight against the Italian and German sopranos . " On her top notes , her insistence on singing all the consonants often makes her voice sound forced , but Crespin is unconcerned : " I always give preference to the word rather than the voice . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; Anguish . Built on the grand scale of the heavy roles she prefers , Crespin is the sort of singing actress who can seem desirable as Tosca and despairing enough for The Masked Ball . " Opera is an art of convention , " she says , " and no one appears ridiculous who has dramatic command of the role . " Her voice , chilly in its lack of vibrato but warm in its swelling power , makes her best for the German opera , and the summit of her ambition is to sing Isolde . Crespin and her Alsatian husband live quietly on a demanding musical diet dictated by her commitments to opera . Her life is now crowded by a 48-week-a-year schedule , but she earnestly gives her free time to learning new roles . As her repertory grows , she is plagued by a persistent dream : she comes onstage , sings two acts , then in the third forgets all her lines . " What fear ! What anguish ! " she exclaims.             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
