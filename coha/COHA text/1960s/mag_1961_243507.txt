M is for the millions who 'll be deluged . <P> O is for the oddball things they 'll get <P> ( Neiman-Marcus ' carrying case for Mom 's contact lenses ; Tiffany 's sterling vermeil decorative rose for $110 ) . <P> T is for the tremendous business volume ( more than $1 billion ) . <P> H is for the heavy push on Dad . <P> E is for the easy credit payments . <P> R is for the rancor that it spreads . <P> Put them all together , and they spell the biggest , boomingest Mother 's Day spree ( May 14 ) since Oedipus wrecked Thebes . On the business side , the nation 's retailers , urged loudly on by the National Committee on the Observance of Mother 's Day , last week were promoting a variety of stunts to pull in the trade : sketching contests of Mom , 25-words-or-less compositions on " I like my Mom because . . . " ; prizes for the oldest grandmother , the youngest , the most fecund . On the straight promotion side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50 states , from which would be chosen the national Mother of the Year . There will be TV Mother of the Year , Cub Scout Mother of the Year-everything , almost , but the High School Mother of the Year . All in all , the heavy promotion made it hard for the serious organizations to keep things spiritual . <P> Along with all the hustle came the annual vociferous difference of opinion on whether all this is good or phony . Says a National Council of Churches official : " One of the things every minister dreads is preaching a Mother 's Day sermon . Those with courage do n't . " Some women would just as soon forget the whole thing . Says New Yorker Betty Carter , mother of five : " Hell , I feel like Mother India all year round . I see no point in being reminded of it once a year . " Recalls Actress Florence Eldridge ( Mrs. Fredric March ) : " When my two children were young , I had to sit at the table with a crown of flowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thorns . " <P> But if pressed , most mothers will concede that they enjoy the affection anyway , commercialized or not . In fact , an anti-anti reaction may be developing . For many people , Mother 's Day is so far out that it 's in-like eating at the Automat or listening to Tchaikovsky . Although not necessarily an authority on anything this side of Samoa , Anthropologist Margaret Mead summarizes this feeling : " Mother 's Day is synthetic . In our culture we just make up things as we go along . But I do n't just laugh at it . Some kind of ritual is important in family life . I say that anything that sets one day off from another and individualizes a family is important . " Manhattan 's Dan Seman could not agree more heartily . Says Seman , who runs the trade division for the National Committee on the Observance of Mother 's Day : " It 's like Christmas . If it were n't a gift-giving as well as a holy day , it would n't have the popularity it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If Christmas was just a church observance , it would n't have that heartfelt significance . And do n't forget , " he adds , " every family has a mother-in-law , too . "
