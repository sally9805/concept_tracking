txt A major move to expand television was made yesterday by the Federal Communications Commission . The commission said that it would seek Congressoinal legislation to force manufacturers to equip all new sets to receive Channels 14 through 83 , in the ultra high frequencies , as well as Channels 2 through 13 , in the very high frequencies . Full utilization of U. H. F. would add seventy channels . There are at present twelve in the lower range V. H. F. The legislation would be designed to compel manufacturers to aid in the development of ultra high frequency television , which up to now has been a failure in many sections of the country . Without a plentiful supply of sets designed to receive Channels 14 through 83 , there has I been scant incentive to open new U. H. F. stations and many that have opened have closed down . Without . U. H. F. stations in operation , manufacturers have not seen any economic wisdom in equipping sets to receive channels that were blank . As of mid-February , there were 493 V. 11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , H. F , outlets . By using legislation to resolve the technical riddle of whether the chicken ( the receiver ) or the egg ( the transmitter ) should come first , the F. C. C. is hopeful of accommodating not only an increased system of commercial TV but also educational and noncommercial TV and pay-as-you-see TV . Word of the commission 's plans came in testimony by Frederick W. Ford , chairman of the F. C. C. , before the Senate Interstate Commerce Committee in Washington . He said that the commission would propose " shortly " to Congress a bill banning from'interstate shipment any receiver not capable of receiving Channels 2 through 83 . Mr. Ford said that most manufacturers had not voluntarily made all-channel receivers and that " the evidence is that that they wo n't unless something of this sort is done . " Pending an opportunity of studying the specific legislaH tion , manufacturers withheld ' immediate comment . At the of-1 Tice of one of the largest set ' manufacturers , it was explained that this was " a whale of a thing " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One set maker said the ' F. C. C. decision to go ahead ' ' with a campaign to force popularization of U. H. F. seemed iqconsistent with the commisslon 's intention ' to erect an experimental U. H. F. station atop the Empire State Tower to test the medium 's practicality . - It has been a matter of engineering controversy whether a U. H. F. station could cover efficiently the same geographical area as one of the outlets between Channels 2 and 13 . Some Offer Option Many manufacturers have offered customers an option of a set tuning Channels 2 through 13 or an all-channel model . The difference-in the cost- between the .. turd types ; bas resulted in most consumers ' passing up the all-channel model when there Were no- U. H. F. stations in a viewer 's area . Forksaid yesterday that adding U. H. F. coverage to new sets would cost about $10 a unit on a mass production basis . In the event of the expanded introduction of U. H. F. , owners of sets receiving only Channels through 13 can buy converters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added outlets . In some locations new aerials also might be necessary . t'onverters can be attached between the antenna lead-in and the set . - - - ? C ... step may. - have an important bearing . on the plans of the City of New York to cooperate in use of the commission 's experimental station on the Empire State Building . The Board of Estimate will consider in about three weeks an appropriation to put programs on Channel 31 . When the F. C , C. is through with its tests , ? the facilities would revert to the city for ? noncommercial educational ' TV . The chief difference between V. H. F. and U. H. F. television is the place of each in the spectrum . The lowest V. H. F. than , nel , . No. .2 ; covers a. band between 54 and 60 megacycles . The highest U. H. F. channel , No. 83 , covers a ' band between 884 and 890 megacycles . The frequency with which a signal ? is sent out ? in televirsion 's case - millions of times a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the F. C. C. , is to assign wave lengths so that each station will be in its . own place in the spectrum . The hearing at . which Mr. Ford announced the F : C. C. 's proposed - legislation was on , a bill to authorize $1,000,000 Fed. - eras grants to each state ' and the District of Columbia for the construction of educational ' TV stations .
