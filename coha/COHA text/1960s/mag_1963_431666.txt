 | A MOB OF MARLIN IN THE BAYS OF PANAMA T he oilman read the cablegram , turned a v ivid shade of heliotrope and unleashed a long exclamatory sentence , most of which could not even be printed by Grove Press . Loosely translated , what he said was that he had told those cretinous associates of his that his fishing trip io Pinas Bay was not to be interrupted or any reason whatsoever ? for any reason whatsoever ? and now here they were , first crack out of the box , pestering him with a minor business matter . What was the minor business matter ? Only that the oilman 's drillers had brought in two gushers back home . It will come as no shock to close relatives of fishermen that the art of angling is followed by as monomaniacal a group of sportsmen as may be found outside of a wet pack , but there are none more given to aberration than those who , like the oilman , follow the black marlin . And of the marlin fishermen , the ones who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to lose all touch with reality . The reason is clear : in these warm @# waters off the northern ebb of the Humboldt Current , the same current that gave Kon-Tiki its free ride to Tahiti , is the thickest concentration of black marlin to be found anyplace in the world . S. Kip Farrington Jr. , founder of Peru 's celebrated Cabo Blanco Club ( SI , March 19 , 1956 ) , has called the black " the most difficult of all the marlins to catch and the most coveted . . . the glamour boy of all fish . " The benighted black-marlin fisherman thinks nothing of trolling day after endless day for the privilege ? no , for the honor ? of hooking one . And if the fishing goes on for a couple of weeks and at last , at last a marlin is caught , is the trip a success ? To the black-marlin fisherman , it is a resounding success , and his words will echo in the halls of the Yale Club or the Union League Club for years afterward with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Consider now , for a welcome relief , the carefully documented , validated and witnessed adventures of Mr. and Mrs. Ross H. Walker of Richmond . The Walkers , an amiable middle-aged couple of @# considerable means , spent 12 days trolling in Piths Bay . On one of those days Mrs. Walker landed six black marlin ( or a lifetime 's supply for many a marlin fisherman ) and her husband boated three . Mrs. Walker caught one of 655 pounds ; her husband caught one of 723 . At the end of their vacation the Walkers had chalked up 47 black marlin , all but 11 of which were released . The Walkers , of course , are highly skilled marlin fishermen . A more typical Pinas Bay experience is the one endured by ? well ? myself . On a recent morning while the Walkers were bringing fish up to their boat with reckless abandon , I began my day 's trolling at 9 . In two hours I had hooked and lost four black marlin . Two of them merely spat out the bait as not quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50-pound test line and snapped it . One hit a bait and , while I was grabbing the rod , nonchalantly cruised over and took the other bait . By the time I could figure out which rod had the action , the marlin was gone , licking his lips over our two fat bonito.  | The fifth fish hit at 11 a.m. and immediately took off on one of those trademark-registered tail-walking acts so characteristic of the breed . " Senor ! " the captain shouted . " He ees a beeg one . " He was , for a fact , somewhat larger than Kelso , and just as fast out of the starting gate . Line stripped off the reel and produced that whine which , to the biggame fisherman , is more beautiful than the Eroica . Occasionally the big fish would pause in his travels and allow himself to be pumped back toward the boat . Five times he was almost to the transom , while the eager mates stood by with the flying gaff and a lasso . But the marlin would count the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange 33-foot floating fish . Each time he made a run , friction on the drag would turn the reel into an ingot of hot steel , and the mates furiously splashed water on reel and fisherman alike . After four exhausting hours , the marlin snapped the 250-pound test leader with one thump of his bill . " Ay , Senor ! " said the furious captain . " You lose heem . " " Yes , " I said . " Just lucky , I guess . " @# I t goes without saying that this fish , like all fish I have lost , would have been a world record . Indeed , the waters of Pinas Bay have accounted already for 12 International Game Fish Association records for black marlin , amberjack , sailfish , blue marlin and silver marlin , and this despite the fact that the place has been scandalously underfished . Until recently , one had to beat one 's way to Panama City , then hire a boat to make the two-day cruise southeast through the Bay of Panama to Piflas . Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonexistent . But those fishermen who were willing to make the effort were rewarded beyond all reasonable hope . Webster Merritt , a fishing captain from Jamaica who decided on living at Piths Bay after seeing how life was lived in Philadelphia , Miami and Panama City , remembers a customer who fought a big marlin for 17 hours , until long after midnight , only to lose the fish on what was , incredibly , the 49th or 50th jump . Four days later the fisherman boated a 960-pound black marlin in four hours . All stories about Pinas eventually get around to the Schmidt brothers , Louis , Ted and John , who have skippered boats in the area for years ( it was Louis Schmidt who took the Walkers out on their recent orgy of marlin catching ) . They tell of the day Louis hooked into a big marlin and fought it for two hours before an ill-fitting harness cut into his back and forced him to give up the rod to his brother John . The marlin weighed 1,006 pounds and was , up to then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reel . Since two men had handled the rod , the IGFA could not certify the catch as a record , but the group did send a certificate of honorable mention to Louis Schmidt who , because of a childhood accident , has only one arm and one leg . Big as this fish was , there are certainly bigger black marlin around Pinas . Dr. William T. Bailey , a marlin fisherman and specialist in radioisotopes at Gorgas Hospital in Panama , tells of one : " John Schmidt hooked a marlin off Jaque Point , and it came up and jumped right near the boat . When that fish plopped back into the water it was exactly as though somebody had dropped a yacht in there . Everybody gasped , but nobody said a word . They knew this was the big one . ' You see him once in your lifetime ; you have one chance . Well , John settled back for the fight . The fish began to take out line ? zip , zip . John tightened down on the drag . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew he could give the fish plenty of pressure . The line kept going out . John gave the drag all he could without snapping the line , and they backed down on the fish as fast as the boat would go . The line settled down to a steady whir . Without the slightest decrease in speed , the marlin stripped the reel and snapped the line . Five hundred yards of line against a 100-pound drag , and he ran it off as if he was just out for a Sunday stroll . You figure out how big that marlin was ! " The first lesson the novice fisherman must learn in dealing with monsters like this is that there is no small amount of danger involved . It is a difficult lesson to @# teach . After all , the tenderfoot protests that is only a fish out there . Yes , but it is a fish that can swim 50 miles an hour and 1,000 pounds of fish proceeding at that speed can generate enough momentum to cause all sorts of mayhem . The great master Farrington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all over the deck , suffered a broken finger , broken hand , a broken reel , a broken chair and numerous other injustices . and had to be admitted to a hospital for examination . A certain mate on a Pinas Bay boat had a habit of holding the line in his teeth while he snapped a loop line onto the outrigger . One day a marlin chose that moment to strike , and now the mate has a smile like a professional ice hockey player . Not even the boat is safe from the wrath of the marlin . Sometimes one will spear a boat while trying to wrest free of the hook ; at other times they will accidentally ram the side while chasing after the smaller fish that of congregate in the boat 's shadow . The usual procedure , if the bill remains in the boat , is to saw it down flush with the hull , sandpaper and varnish it . Then it becomes a badge of honor , and the skipper will never tire of telling you the whole story . @# Another problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characterized best by the offhand comment of a woman who proclaimed after a day 's trolling , " I have never seen the sailfish worse than they were today ! " By that she meant that the sails , certainly to be counted among nature 's noblefishes , had been even bigger pests than usual . When one is expecting ing Beluga caviar , one does n't want shad roe , and when one is fishing for black marlin one hopes that the sailfish will stay home in bed . Likewise with dolphinPinas Bay has a population of dolphin so dense that it would come as no surprise to see ichthyologists suggest some sort of a birth-control campaign . The dolphin are everywhere , hacking at marlin baits too big for their mouths and ripping and slashing at the two feathered jigs that are trolled on handlines to pick up live bonito for bait . When the skipper  | sees the indescribable luminescent bluegreen-purple flash of a dolphin coming up fast astern , he shoves the throttles forward hoping to outrun the fish . Sometimes , but not often enough for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there arrives on the scene somebody who wants to catch dolphin , to the confusion of locals to whom anything less than a monster black marlin is a bullhead . One such dolphin fancier is fondly remembered by John Doonan , pilot of the plane that now whisks fishermen from Panama City to Pinas Bay in 45 minutes . His name was Marcel , " Doonan recalls , and , of course , he was a gourmet and , of course , he was a Frenchman . We 'd go out trolling in the morning and before we 'd even reached the fishing waters Marcel would have the butter melting in the frying pan , the parsley chopped , and a little packet of secret herbs standing by . The second somebody landed a dolphin , Marcel would be up on that deck with a sharp knife . In less time than it takes to tell it he 'd straddle the dolphin , slash a couple of steaks off him and race below to plop it in the pan . For the rest of the day , Marcel 'd just sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not all the fishes of Pinas Bay are as benign as the dolphin . There is , in these waters , as astounding an array of sharks and other evil animal life as is to be found east of the Great Barrier Reef of Australia . It is not uncommon to see six or eight different types on one day 's cruise : spinner sharks , which come whirling out of the water , all the better to stun schools of baitfish ; great white sharks , the deadliest of the man-eaters ; hammerhead sharks and shovel-nosed sharks , leopard sharks and tiger sharks , harmless whale sharks , nurse sharks , makos and blues . When marlin are being butchered , the sharks assemble in convention . Throw a loaf of bread overboard and they will take it , paper and all , in one gulp . They are also partial to humans . When boats go down off Panama , there are hardly ever any survivors . The current talk around Pinas is of an American who dived overboard a few weeks ago to unfoul a line twisted around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strongly @#  | impressed on him that he should never attempt to repeat the feat . And if the sharks are not enough to keep the fisherman from dangling his feet in the water , there is the sea snake . The sea snake is a cute little fellow , seldom exceeding three feet in length , colored in handsome shades of brown and yellow , with five or six dark bands on his tail . His occupation is chasing minnows , and nature has flattened his body somewhat to give him more maneuverability in the water . Nature has also provided him with a deadly poison and positioned him in the family of cobras . You spot sea snakes everyday in Pinas Bay , and it is said that they are so timid and docile that some of the natives remove them from fish nets bare-handed . ( I am unable to document this , and I did not try picking them up bare-handed myself , as there was not sufficient time for such experiments . ) There is almost no end to the kinds and varieties of aquatic life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can never be sure what is going to hit one 's bait or rise out of the depths to circle the boat ominously . For example , take the experience of one of the ubiquitous Schmidts . One night Ted Schmidt was sleeping soundly aboard his boat , anchored in the bay , when he was awakened by an almost imperceptible clanking sound . Schmidt became annoyed and climbed out of his bunk to tie down what he thought must be a loose piece of hardware rolling around on the deck above . But as he clambered to his feet , long experience on boats made him realize instantly that they were under way , though slowly . Schmidt grabbed a flashlight , played it around the deck and discovered that the anchor chain was taut and running dead ahead . The heavy fishing boat and anchor were being towed by a manta ray that had caught its horns in the chain and was now headed south for the winter . Schmidt started the engines , applied a burst of full speed astern , flipped the manta ray free of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multi-ton mantas and the other monstrous inhabitants of Pinas Bay are there simply because the smallest organisms of the ocean are 68 N71-SLIP SURE-FOOTED COMFORT most flexible , coolest on deck , court . campus SPERRY 1 TOP-SIDER ' 17 Rubber Ave. , Naugatuck , Ct . en 's os. $9.95 there : plankton . The food chain start , with plankton , both the plant and animal varieties . It hangs in the water in great curtains , made visible much the same as dust is sometimes made visible in a room by a slanting ray of sunlight . Some of the planktons are phosphorescent ; at night , boats leave long trails of glittering green and gold behind them . The zooplankton feed on the phytoplankton ; tiny minnows feed on the zooplankton ; from there the chain run . straight through sardines , anchovies. skipjacks and blue runners to bonito. grouper , amberjack and dolphin , then up through larger species like sailfish. jewfish and , hanging around the edgewaiting for some baitfish to stray , the marlin . Sometimes the whole chain is starkly visible in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface by the bonito stirring the water to a cauldron , corraling the sardines and the skipjacks like cowhands , hacking them to pieces in ever-diminishing circles of spray . Just above the surface of the water , gulls wheel in raucous gluttony , picking up the leavings and occasionally suffering a nip from an overanxious bonito. @# I f you are lucky , you may see that slickest pirate of them all , the frigate bird , supervising the activities of his employees , the cormorants . The frigate bird hovers high overhead on wings six and seven feet long ; you can watch him all day and never see a flicker of movement in the wings . He was built for gliding ; his bones are filled with outsize air pockets to lighten the load . The frigate bird likes the same delicacies as the cormorant , but he does not like to exert himself . So when he sees a cormorant come up with a fish , the frigate bird swoops down and grabs the meal away . After this happens a few times the cormorant decides to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , beats his wings about the poor cormorant 's head and makes it plain that he had better stick around if he knows what 's good for him . Now the cormorant may decide to sulk , but the frigate bird will have none of that , either .  | He swoops down and pecks the co -- morant on the back of the head until the poor bird goes back to work on Ix : - half of the unequal partnership . On . when the frigate bird is stuffed with fish does the scene end . It is difficult to IY annoyed with the frigate bird when ore considers that the Japanese have been doing roughly the same thing with the cormorant for centuries . The lesson of history is clear : it is a tough job to be a cormorant for a living . All of these sights were observed h .. a wealthy Texan , Ray Smith of Dallas .. who liked what he saw ( and caught ) and promptly pulled off the impossible . He equipped 40 Choco Indians with machetes and axes and set them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By January of this year , Smith 's can ' : ' had grown into the Club de Pesca de Panama , a $600,000 jungle fishing club featuring an air-conditioned saloon and the only natives with Texas accents o -- the entire Pacific coast of Panama . For the first weeks of the club 's existence most of the customers were Texans. either friends of Smith from Dallas o friends of friends . The result ( temporary , one hopes ) is natives who reteto every fish , Texas style , as " big old or " little bitty . " The tiniest bit of Tex:s boastmanship has crept in , too , as in the fishing-boat crewman who introduced himself and immediately added : " I am a better fisherman than my brother . " Or the one who said : " I have an uncle . He is a doctor . Plenty school . Plenty money . " Withal , the natives who run Club de Pesca de Panama , some of them imported from Panama City and some of them from primitive villages around Pinas Bay . remain sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hotel personnel as one could imagine . Out in the bay on one of Smith 's nine deepwater boats , the crewmen seem motivated by a desire to keep the fisherman from having to move so much as a single digit . If one heads for the beer cooler . one suddenly sees a streak of brown intercepting one 's path , followed quickly by a hand proffering a bottle of " Balboa , contenido alcoholico minimo 3.30% , maximo 3.90% por peso , " opened and @# @#  | wrapped gently in a napkin . The crewmen 's campaign to keep the fisherman happy extends even to emotional matters . As Alejandro Anderson , skipper of one of Smith 's boats , explains : " I tell my men , When the fishermen laugh , you laugh . If they frown , you frown . ' " It is like looking in a mirror all day . There are disturbing signs , however , that this benign naivete will not last forever , and before long all the natives will be as sophisticated as a New York City cabdriver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have seen the first indication on a recent trip to Club de Pesca . Three wild-looking Choco Indians , clad in loincloths and fancy headdress , appeared near the club and Brister asked them if he could snap their picture . Said the Indians , " One dollar . " Despite the trappings of civilization that Smith has introduced ? the water softeners , the drydock , the power plant , the air conditioners ? he has done little to change the essential character of Pinas Bay . From the air one sees only a complex of buildings with thatched roofs ( concealing aluminum roofs ) landscaped with banana trees and coconut palms on a hillside running down to the beach . On the ground one sees wild orchids , egrets , sand crabs and cannibal ants . There is about the whole camp some of the mood of works by Joseph Conrad and Graham Greene : a heavy steaminess of air , a lushness of growth , a lassitude . One halfway expects to see Trevor Howard step from behind a eucalyptus tree and bum a light , his native @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries prowling the jungle for him . For his part , Ray Smith , who made his money in trucking and oil , merely thinks of the place he carved out of the jungle as " neat but not gaudy , " a place whose raison d'etre is marlin . The club served a large part of its purpose a few months ago , so far as Smith is concerned , when he went out and nailed a 186 ? - pound black marlin on 12-pound test line , a new IGFA record . " I think there are going to be all kinds of records set here , " he says , " now that the place is being fished a little harder . " Meanwhile , he wages a constant fight against the jungle , which encroaches on the camp with @# a diabolical tenacity . Four men are employed full time hacking away at the mahogany , balsa , cedar , hibiscus , coconut palms and just plain weeds that infiltrate the grounds . Less of a problem , but always lurking in the back of one 's mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life of the rain forest to the rear . There are the moccasin and the coral snake , the fer-de-lance and the bushmaster . There is the cute little meracho. a lizard that moves so fast it can run across streams and ponds , its feet never breaking the surface tension . Thus he is more commonly known as the Jesfis Cristo . The minute you find yourself growing attached to the fascinating little meracho you run into one who takes an instant dislike to you and bites you in the leg , sometimes chasing you at blinding speed to do it . At the other extreme are the mountain cows , domestic cattle that have gone wild . They weigh up to 800 pounds , have huge curved horns and think nothing whatever of charging you because of the color of your socks . Somewhere between these two mischiefs is the anteater , a big fellow who , upon sighting a human , stands upright and beckons with his arms , as though to tell you to come on in and mix it up . No one knows whether he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a man or not ; no one has ever tried to find out . @# But these denizens of the jungle , along with the puma , the jaguar , the ocelot , the iguana. the wild boar , are more the creatures of evening discussions in the bar than they are creatures of reality . They give human beings a wide berth ; you would have to go out of your way to see them . And anyway , Club de Pesca de Panama does n't face backward into the jungle ; it looks out to sea , where the bonito churn up the water and the wild black marlin dance on their tails and giant manta rays glide in ferocious-looking harmlessness . The name of the club is the tip-off . Translated from the Spanish and the Indian , Ray Smith 's club is named : " Club of Fish of Abundance of Fish . " Even for a Texan , that is an understatement .
