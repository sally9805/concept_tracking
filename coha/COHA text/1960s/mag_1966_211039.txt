( See Cover ) <P> The great upheaval defied analysis . Day after day , as Red China 's latest convulsion swept the nation , reason dissipated itself in the mad mobs and red banners that festooned the broad boulevards of Peking . There seemed to be no pattern to the shouted slogans , no rhythm to the dialectical drums . That Red China was undergoing a convulsion of historic proportion could not be doubted . Beneath the tremors , a few simple facts were apparent : - Mao Tse-tung is still his nation 's leader and a vigorous one at that . - Mao 's army is the chosen vehicle of a sweeping change he has decided to impose on his 750 million people . - Mao 's anointed heir and chief instrument , Defense Minister Lin Piao , *59 , has emerged as the redeemer of the revolution . <P> <P> Beyond those basic facts , the West could see no more than the Chinese fireworks ignited by Mao 's fulminating Red Guards , who since last month have been everywhere imposing a new discipline , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a do-it-yourself revolution . <P> Tears of Joy . What it might mean to China 's friends or China 's neighbors-from Moscow to Washington-was a matter of grave concern . The world 's oldest continuous civilization has al ways proved an enigma to the rest of the world . In its current hysteria , China remains a puzzlement . The pieces of the puzzle began to fall into place last week in the nation 's streets . <P> <P> There , the Red Guards were running riot . Into a Canton barbershop burst a squad of Red Guards , accusing the barbers of using " capitalist-smelling " pomade . The barbers struck back , and two teen-age Guards fell , slashed to death . In a Peking side street , a woman wept as her neighbor was led away-but she was weeping for joy . The old man had once hired her for the humiliating duty of wet-nursing his children . <P> <P> To compound the nightmare , the Red Guards were striking at many of the things that the Chinese have always respected . Buddhist shrines were defaced ; schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along purely Maoist lines ) . Respect for womanhood and religion was forcibly forgotten . Into British-controlled Hong Kong came eight victims : exhausted Franciscan nuns , one of whom died after being thrown onto a wheelbarrow and harshly trundled across the border . <P> Even Communists were not sacrosanct . A pair of East German army officers were dragged from their cars and knocked about like so many imperialists . The offense was severe enough to draw a stiff protest from Pankow-one of many objections from Communist countries to China 's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution . Even Cuba 's Fidel Castro , no believer in gentle Communism , denounced the Peking paranoids . " It is a sad circumstance , " lamented a Havana editorial , " that the People 's Republic of China has given the enemies of socialism cause for laughing and taunting . " Russia weighed in with its own protest after Red Guards halted and humiliated the Soviet charge d'affaires by holding a portrait of Mao in front of him . <P>               @ @ @ @ @ @
