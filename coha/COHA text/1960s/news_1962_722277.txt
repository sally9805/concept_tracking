txt The average cost of an hour of , factory labor , with fringe benefits and social security charges included , was only 80 cents in the leading European Common Market countries in 1959 , a study of labor costs in Europe has just disclosed . In the same year . the average labor cost in United States factories was $2.19 an hour for wages alone . Since 1959 wages have risen sharply in Europe . Adding this increase , the average labor cost today in these countries is approximately $1 an hour , again with all " extras " included . This compares with $2.36 an hour for wages alone last November in the United States . The new study of labor costs to the employer in // Europe was made by the Executive Commission of the European Economic Community , or Common Market . It covered 10,000 concerns , fourteen indus- , tries and 1,000.000 workers . As in the United States , the average labor cost was higher in some industries than in others . But the highest cost found ? among auto workers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about $1.25 today . Labor costs in the United States auto industry are more than $3 an hour . The new labor cost figures are likely to be cited during debate over President Kennedy 's proposed tariff-cutting legislation , although the cyst of labor is only one of a number of factors entering into the total cost and selling price of any product . The over-all average figure of 80 cents an hour for 1959 applies to France , West Germany and Belgium . The average labor costs per hour to the employer in the three nations were almost ' the same , with differences in actual wages offset by differ. ; ences in social security and other fringe charges . In the Netherlands , labor in 1959 cost on the average 69 cents an hour and in Italy 65 cents . It would now be about SO cents in the Netherlands and a little under SO cents in Italy . ' There were no figures for the sixth and smallest Common Market country , Luxembourg , hut . wages there are on a par with the three " richest " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost of while-collar labor in 1959 , again with all " extras " included , ranged from $298 a month in Italy to $222 a month in the Netherlands . These figures were deemed less reliable than those concerning factory workers . The main reason the United States can still compete with European industries is its greater mechanization or automation . This means that less labor is required for each unit produced . ' United States productivity , or output per man-hour , is much higher than in Europe . Other reasons include frequently cheaper raw material costs in the United States , cheaper power costs , spreading of overhead and selling costs over a. larger volume , more efficient retail distribution and , in some industries , lower profit margins . Despite these offsets , there is tittle doubt that the great , difference in labor costs permits European manufacturers to produce a wide variety of products more cheaply than American manufacturers . This benefit tends to he eliminated for the European consumer , however , by added taxes , ; ranging as high as 25 per cent of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tax does not ' exist in the United States , which relics more heavily on personal and corporation income taxes . Tax Rebated on Exports While taxes raise prices for European consumers , they are rebated on exports . Therefore. : any cost advantage a European ' producer may obtain from his , cheaper labor charges is his to ' exploit in export markets . Thus , for almost all basic steel ; products . European export prices ' are lower than American prices. ; But the cost of a refrigerator , or washing machine in the shops ! is. on the whole , higher in Europe . While wages have been rising , much more rapidly in Europe ! than in the United States , in ; percentage terms , the gap in ; absolute terms has narrowed , very little . A 10 per cent in : crease for a German worker might give hint an extra 8 cents an hour - the same addition as a 7. or 1 per cent increase in the united States . Furthermore , European productivity has been rising rapidly . One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lowering of trade harriers and creation of a mass market , is to increase it further . High ' ' ' . Output Helps Thus , a lame part of the ex- ' reptionally steep increase in wages in Europe in the past : three years has been offset by ? higher output per man-hour . Economic history suggests , , however , that in the long run ' wages in all countries move closely in line with productivity. ; American workers are well paid ' because their productivity is high . European workers are less : well paid because their productivity is still relatively low . American exports of morel than $1,000,000,000 last year in ! manufactured products to the ' , Common Market countries is one evidence that American , prices , despite the great labor cost differences , are not always higher than European prices . " The reason is higher American ' productivity .
