The launching of a missile , any missile , is breathtaking . It is stirring , awesome , unforgettable , like Fourth of July parades , our flag , the soaring notes of " The Star-Spangled Banner . " It makes you proud just to watch or listen . It shouts power and ability . It promises great adventure , and this day , May 5 , 1961 , the promise was to be fulfilled . A man was in the capsule . Above Cape Canaveral 's tightly guarded rocket range , morning star and half-moon shone benignly in a peaceful sky . A whippoorwill called in the early-morning quiet . On Pad 5 stood a gleaming Redstone rocket ,  | fueled and fuming with impatience . On its nose --  60 feet from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spacecraft bearing the name Freedom 7 . And strapped down in that capsule lay the man selected from 180,000,000 Americans to make the first United States space flight : Astronaut Alan B. Shepard , Jr . As one of seven physicians assigned to the Mercury astronauts , I had ridden with Shepard in the big transfer van that brought him to the launching pad . I had watched his bulky silver figure step briskly through the blaze of searchlights to the gantry elevator and ascend to the enclosed platform around the capsule . He grasped an overhead brace and swung his feet through the capsule 's narrow hatch . A rubber pad on the bottom edge of the hatch protected against snags in his all-important pressure suit.While white-gowned attendants steadied him , he wriggled his body inside and onto his molded couch ( page 423 ) . Technicians carefully tightened straps over knees , lap , chest , and shoulders . Now he was alone . The hatch cover was in place , shutting him oil from the world except for headphones and a di'Aurted view through his wide angle periscope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thou- sands of people had labored to make this day possible ? the scientists who had drawn the plans and trained the astronauts ; the artisans who had assembled the unbelievably complicated capsule and its rocket booster ; the crews aboard recovery ships ; the multitude of technicians who were to monitor and track his flight . Perhaps 10,000 of us were in some way a part of the Mercury program ? and all were now sweating it out with Shepard. * And across the Nation television screens by the millions would shortly light up . Americans in every city and farm and hamlet would be unified as seldom before in their rapt concentration ; their hopes and prayers would ride with Alan Shepard . " What Have We Forgotten ? " It was now past five o'clock . In the sequence of early-morning moves , which had begun with the awakening of Shepard at 1:05 a.m. in his secluded quarters at Hangar S on the Cape , I had noticed a quiet tension . We had all paused as we left the hangar , as though about to make an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had brought her rosary to work . Astronaut Virgil I. Grissom , normally quiet , seemed a bit more talkative . Flight surgeon William K. Douglas , the astronauts ' chief physician , seemed to be thinking , " What have we forgotten ? " After a last look at the spectacular beauty of the rocket poised in the white glare of searchlights , I turned from the van to the thick-walled blockhouse , carrying my black bag of doctor 's tools and my brief case . The latter contained a copy of the countdown , a copy of the postflight medical procedures , my access badges , and a Bible . This Bible had been sent to President Eisenhower in March , 1959 , by children in Toledo , Ohio , with the hope that it would be placed aboard the first rocket to carry one of our men into space . He might be lonely and afraid , they thought , and the Bible would comfort him . Unhappily the weight limits in the capsule were critical , and we dared not add another ounce . But Bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least it should be near the astronaut . In the crowded , busy blockhouse I joined Army physician William S. Augerson at the end of the row of telemetry racks connected with the capsule by wire . Here information about Shepard 's physical condition , relayed from electrodes attached to his body , wa showing up on dials and recorders . Shifting to radio shortly before take-off , or T-time. it would continue until the end of the flight , now about four and a half hours away . " Auto retro jettison switch ? arm ? " asked the voice of the pad leader . Back came the response from Shepard : " Roger , auto retro jettison switch ? arm And so the strange liturgy proceeded : " Retro heater switch ? off ? " " Roger .... " " Landing bag switch ? auto ? " " Roger .... " Astronaut 's Tasks Suppress Anxiety As the count shortened , we busied ourselves . Augerson was concerned with the dials and switches , the communications and the count . I watched the medical data flowing in on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record body temperature , respiration , pulse rate , and electrical potentials of heart muscle of the man lying out there atop the Redstone . We knew Shepard felt some slight apprehension ? he had told us so during the morning examination . But he suppressed such thoughts by focusing on his tasks , watchine his instruments , and reporting to the blockhouse , so that his pulse and rate of breathing stayed at moderate levels . A blockhouse countdown can be compared to the performance of a symphony orchestra responding to the cues of its conductor . Or perhaps two orchestras , one for the booster . one for the capsule . Our test conductors checked in turn with the men sitting at the instrument racks ? men who had exchanged @#  | names for functions : Telemetry , Electrical Power , Environmental Control , Communications . We seldom spoke except for our laconic responses in the countdown . At intervals the rhythm was shut out when Astronaut Leroy G. Cooper , Jr. , switched Augerson and me to the private line which permitted telephone conversation with the pilot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same role Astronaut Donald K. ( " Deke " ) Slayton was playing in the control center . " Are You Really Ready ? " During one of these moments , at about Tminus-6-minutes , I asked Shepard for an honest answer to an honest question . " Are you really ready ? " I asked . He laughed and shouted , " Go ! " " Good luck , old friend , " I replied . Now it was about 9:30 . Shepard had been in the capsule four hours and a quarter ; in the suit about six hours and a half . T-minus-25-seconds : The blockhouse lyrics sang : " LOX tank pressurized . " " Vehicle power . " Now the time was at hand . The umbilical tower dropped away from the Redstone , breaking our direct line connections to booster and capsule . The bird was on its own power and feeding us radio telemetry information . The announcer 's voice betrayed excitement as the final words of the liturgy rang through the blockhouse public address system : " Ignition . . . Mainstage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " was almost shrill . Then came a softer , calmer voice from the capsule : " Roger , lift-off , and the clock is started . " Shepard 's timepiece in the capsule now would give him precise readings for the start and termination of each critical function . The booster roared , filling the blockhouse with thunderous noise , a surprising noise , a noise I could feel . But to Shepard it was less noise than he had expected . In his own words , " The lift-off was very smooth . " Tapes flew through the recorder before me as I interpreted lift-off data : pulse 124 , respiration 30 , deep body temperature 99 . I did not see the actual launch ( page 425 ) ; the blockhouse windows are in another room , and I was too busy to look at the four TV screens behind me . Crowds of eyewitnesses did watch from the beach adjoining Canaveral ( pages 428-9 ) . Hundreds of reporters peered through binoc- ulars on the Cape , and workers on near gantries laid aside tools to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The minds of these watchers were fit with the sobering realization that this roc this roaring bucket of fire , carried a man . just a load of instruments . Tears sprang the eyes of men and women alike , and m found themselves praying . " O.K. , Jose , you 're on your way ! " c Deke Slayton 's voice from the capsule co municator 's console in the control center . was a reference to an old joke among the tronauts about a television spaceman dubl Jose Jimenez . Flight controllers in Mercury Control Ce ter had taken over the responsibility no Upward the capsule flew , slowly at first , th fast , faster , fastest . Up through the vibr tion at the speed of sound ? Mach 1 , Mach 2 . Faster still , beyond the roughness of maximum aerodynamic pressures , up into the atmosphere 's geography where names like troposphere , stratosphere , ozonosphere , and ionosphere apply . Past Mach 3 , Mach 4 , the three of them flew ? the booster , the capsule , and Shepard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Q ' ; , and 5 g 's . Explosive Bolts Release Capsule For a few seconds at about Mach 1 , when aerodynamic pressure reached its peak , vibration made the instrument needles appear a little fuzzy . However , the pilot was able to read his meters accurately . Then he reported , " Smoother now , a lot smoother . " He had experienced the only real difficulty of the entire flight . T-plus-142-seconds : " Booster cutoff . " The Redstone howling its way down the Atlantic Missile Range became abruptly silent. * Explosive bolts fired , the clamp ring fell away , the tiny posigrade rockets gave their little 20-foot-per-second push to the capsule , and the g 's were gone . " Cap sep is green , " the astronaut a nounced . Capsule and booster had separate ( The most dangerous moment of the flight had passed safely . There were backup circuits designed to ensure firing of the explosive bolts , and Shepard , who had a personnel parachute , might have survived a high-speed bail-out if the capsule had not separated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have plunged at high speed into the  | ocean . Shepard 's pulse count had reached its peak for the flight . 138 ? no faster than if he had run up a flight of stairs . More than 6,400 feet in every second , 4,375 miles per hour they raced , Shepard and Freedom 7 . With my red pencil I hurried too , over unfolding data on the strip charts . I printed numbers and words like " respiration 32 " and " temperature unchanged . " Plus 157 seconds : " Orbit attitude command , ' . " droned the announcer . " The turnaround has started : called the pilot . " Roger . " Slayton dispassionately acknowledged a great triumph : The automatic system for stabilizing the capsule was working in its intended environment . Plus 180 seconds : " Turnaround completed . " Freedom 7 was now traveling big end first , heat shield and retrorockets aimed along the flight path . And now the pilot had begun five minutes of weightlessness , during which he experienced no discomfort and no difficulty in breathing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , switching to manual pitch . " Pitch down , pitch up . " Pitch is O.K. Switching to manual yaw . " And thus Shepard matter-offactly stated an even greater triumph . He had tested the manual controls and they worked well ( page 430 ) . The dialogue sounded like any session on the procedures trainer at Langley Air Force Base , Virginia . Plus 240 seconds : Time to look through the periscope , check horizon , try to identify land masses and cloud formations . Okeechobee , and Andros , and cloud cover over Hatteras ? all are recognizable . " What a beautiful view ! " cried the man a hundred miles in the sky . " I 'll bet it is , " answered Slayton . Freedom 7 is at apogee , 116.5 miles high . Look for the moon ! No , the moon has set . We were late in lifting off . Are the stars visible even in daylight ? Ca n't tell ; the sun is bouncing off the edge of the porthole . Actually Shepard observed little outside the capsule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 300 seconds : " Retro attitude on green ... Retro one very smooth . . . Retro two ... Retro three . All three retros are fired . " The braking rockets burn briefly . They 're not needed on this flight , but we 're testing them for the day when they will be , to bring a man and capsule out of orbit . Plus 360 seconds : The burned-out retrorockets will soon be jettisoned . Wait , where 's the retro-jettison light ? N ; ' 427  | " I do not have a light . I see the straps falling away . I heard a noise . I will use override . " There , the light ! Retro-jettison had worked . The failure of the green signal light was the only capsule malfunction during the entire flight . When Shepard got the light by pushing the override button , it was one more victory for those who had planned so carefully for such emergencies . " How 's he doing ? " asked the voice of rocket expert Wernher von Braun behind me . " Excellent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red pencil I wrote " all normal " on the moving charts for those who gathered around our console . Plus 420 seconds : The .05-g light in the capsule is armed and will go on in about 50 seconds when Freedom 7 's sense of touch de-430  | tects five-hundredths of the earth 's normal embrace , at approximately 200,000 feet . Reentry g 's will follow ; they will reach 11 . Shepard will tense his muscles to prevent losing consciousness. * Plus 480 seconds : G 's are increasing . " Three . " Tense your calves , strain at the harness ! " Six , " he called into the two microphones against his lips . " Nine . " I could hear it in his voice ; he was straining , as expected . It 's quite a feat to talk against these forces . Once he reached the maximum and the pressures eased , he would call O.K. There it was ! " O.K. . . O. K. ! " He had easily endured the flight 's severest physical stress , a g-force of 11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cabin air rose to 111 ? F. Plus 580 seconds : " The drogue is out . " Augerson and I were beginning to see weakening of our telemetry signal as Shepard and his capsule descended rapidly . The needles vibrated erratically . Voices on the blockhouse speakers called off the altitude : " Fifteen ... thirteen ... twelve . . . eleven .. . main chute , ten thousand feet . " " Main chute is green . Main chute is coming unreefed , and it looks good ! " What 's the rate of descent ? " Rate of descent is reading about 35 feet per second . " Earth 's Curvature Blocks Radio Contact What relief Shepard must have felt ! So many things might have gone wrong ? fire , failure of the capsule to separate , loss of pressure , failure of the chutes . But none of these had happened , and none of the stresses of noise , heat , vibration , and g-force had been too severe for a man so magnificently trained . Now all movement in the blockhouse stopped . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us from below the horizon . We could only listen to the recovery forces at a point 302 miles from Pad 5 . There was restrained rejoicing when we learned that the landing bag that cushions the capsule 's impact was extended , and when 2,000 visual sightings were reported in the @# same instant by those aboard the carrier U.S.S. Lake Champlain , as they saw the orange-and-white main chute blossom . Helicopters were talking to Shepard . Plus 922 seconds : Now came word from the aircraft overhead : " Impact . The capsule is in the water ? looks good . " At this point Shepard uttered the now famous words , " Everything A-O.K . " Then came the final assurance : " Shepard is in the copter ! " Now the flight was over , now Shepard could exclaim , " Man , what a ride ! " Only 25 minutes from Pad 5 , and he was on the carrier . I joined Bill Douglas , Astronauts Grissom and Slayton , and others , and we hurried to meet Shepard at Grand Bahama Island , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought him from the carrier . All the way down we were grinning and shaking our heads in a kind of approbation . Ultimate Target : the Moon ? and Back When Shepard came through the hospital door , we greeted him as though he had left our group months , not hours , before . He was self-possessed , although there were signs of quiet excitement and exhilaration . " Everything went well .... I feel fine .... It was a wonderful flight . " Our elaborate two-day medical study in the Bahamas failed to show us anything we had not learned already in centrifuge tests . Alan did n't even need a Band-Aid . There had been no lurking , unsuspected dangers . We have every reason to believe that this was a typical Redstone flight . By the time you read these words , another Redstone may have soared into space , carrying Gus Grissom or John Glenn . Later a third man may try the downrange flight , and then a chimp will be shot into orbit . Late this year , or more probably sometime next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Shepard 's brief sortie was the prelude . As I began to feel the inevitable letdown , the overwhelming wave of relief releasing the strain of the last few months , I heard Grissom say jokingly , " There wo n't be this much fuss next time . When you 've seen one , you 've seen them all . " I disagree . To me , the men who ride and aspire to ride our Freedom 7 's will always be heroes . The progressive steps made by these and later vehicles will always be exciting ? one orbit around the earth , or three orbits ; then finally , probably before this decade is out , to the moon and back .
