As it will for months and maybe years to come , the Justice Department 's antitrust suit against International Business Machines Corp . last week continued to pose new questions for the courts , the computer industry and the nation 's securities markets . <P> WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN THE COURTS ? IBM , which has produced about two-thirds of the 43,000 computers in the U.S. , is charged with violation of the Sherman Act 's Section 2 , a broad prohibition of " monopoly " that suggests that bigness alone is bad . The most direct precedent traces to 1945 , when the U.S. directed the Aluminum Co. of America to split off properties . The key opinion was written by Judge Learned Hand of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals , who decided that law " did not condone ' good trusts ' and condemn ' bad ' ones ; it forbade all . " <P> A more permissive view may well be taken by the Nixon Administration 's newly named chief trustbuster , Richard W. McLaren , a Chicago lawyer who headed the American Bar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be to " look at performance as well as structure " and fol low the " rule of reason . " He thus echoes Stanley Barnes , the Eisenhower Administration 's activist antitrust chief . <P> Barnes handled a large volume of monopoly cases but settled with consent decrees to end certain practices rather than press for dissolution . <P> HOW WILL IBM CHANGE ? IBM is like ly to end one practice that the Justice Department criticized : the policy of selling computers , software and related services to customers on a single-price , all-or-nothing basis . That tends to freeze out small suppliers , which can offer only pieces and parts of the total system . Aware that Justice has been investigating the computer industry for two years , IBM last month said that it would proclaim a new policy no later than July . <P> HOW COULD THE LITIGATION AFFECT IBM STOCK ? After a 2-for-l split last May , the stock rose to a high of 375 in June . Since then , word of the investigation and heavy selling by mutual funds have worried the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to close at 299 . Doubtless the legal news will over shadow Wall Street 's perennial glamour stock for some time . But there could be a benefit . In the event that IBM has to divest itself of some business , it would do so by creating a new company and distributing shares to IBM stockholders . <P> Presumably , investors would be happy to have a piece of any company that IBM might spin off .
