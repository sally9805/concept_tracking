For Chrysler employees and stockholders , it was the second bad shock in a month . Just three weeks ago , amid rumors of corporate skulduggery . William Charles Newberg , 49 , left the corporation only nine weeks after he took over as president . Last week the full extent of his shady goings on was made public . Chrysler announced that Newberg had agreed to return " profits in excess of $450,000 made by him from interests in vendor companies . " Corporate executives at Chrysler , including Chairman Lester Lum ( " Tex " ) Colbert , normally a vocal fellow , were just as reluctant to talk about this startling news as they were about Newberg 's sudden departure . <P> But Detroit insiders were able to put together the story . The overhaul in Chrysler purchasing policies started last fall when a tough young ( 38 ) engineer , W. C. <P> Cawthon , was appointed general purchasing agent , the key job in dealing with supplier companies . As an engineer , Cawthon knew what Chrysler was buying-and whether it was getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend Newberg president , Tex Colbert summoned all his executives to an 11 a.m . <P> meeting , delivered an ultimatum . Some of them had interests in Chrysler suppliers , he said , and the practice had been going on for some time . His ultimatum : everyone must get rid of his interests by 5 p.m . <P> Profitless Prosperity . One of the chief offenders was Newberg , whom Colbert had groomed to succeed himself . Angry at the reports that Newberg had disregarded the ultimatum , Colbert put to work Chrysler 's lawyers and auditors to make sure . When the evidence showed that Newberg was profiting from Chrysler 's purchases from smaller suppliers , Colbert got the board of directors to fire him . The investigation has not stopped with Newberg , Colbert admitted last week . It could well be that Newberg is just the first and biggest offender to get caught . <P> Chrysler of late has been suffering from a profitless prosperity ; first-quarter profits dropped 28% in 1960 under 1959 , though sales were up 34% . Part of the problem is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slippage should result from supplier overcharging and executive rake-offs . <P> Stockholder Sol Dann , a Detroit lawyer and self-appointed watchdog for Chrysler 's stockholders who has long been publicly charging " corruption " against Chrysler brass , announced that he would file suit on behalf of the stockholders against Chrysler 's management to see if any more cash might be recovered . <P> The Country Boy . The man who was apparently least concerned by the mess was Newberg himself , who righteously announced that he had disposed " of the current differences of opinion in a way that would leave my record clean without any doubt as to my integrity . " He did not seem distressed at losing a six-figure-salary job as head of the ninth largest U.S. corporation , or disturbed by the harm he had done to the reputation of Chrysler , where he had worked 27 years .
