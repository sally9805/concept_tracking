A Voice from the grave by John Wain " Why are so many people in England down on Cyril Connolly ? " Edmund Wilson asked me , really wanting to know , when I first met him in 1957 . He meant , of course , English writers and literary people generally , not the English public , who are so much the reverse of " down on " Mr. Connolly that he must be reckoned our most successful literary columnist . I mumbled some evasion , but the question continued to nag inside my head ; Mr. Connolly 's work does tend , in England , to be dismissed with a patronizing judgment , often by people who are obviously nothing like as sensitive , witty and informed as he is , and there must be some reason for it . One explanation springs to mind at once . Mr. Connolly makes his living as a critic , but his criticism has about it a continual air of pushing against the closed door that leads into imaginative writing . He is the exact opposite of the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . " Mr. Connolly 's attitude , by contrast , is fairly summed up in a sentence from the recently reissued Enemies of Promise ( 1938 ) , " Since I was unable to write in any living language when I left Eton I was already on the way to becoming a critic . " The role for which he has cast himself , and for which we constantly see him applying the greasepaint , is that of the Failed Writer . That same passage goes on : " My ambition was to be a poet but I could not succeed when poetry was immersed in the Georgian or neoTennysonian tradition . I could but have imitated Housman , Flecker , Brooke , de la Mare or Ralph Hodgson . By the time Eliot and Valery came to save my generation from the romantic dragon it had already devoured me . I was however well-grounded enough to become a critic and drifted into it through unemployability . " Clearly enough , this kind of talk is intensely irritating to a High Priest of criticism , such as F. R. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the American New Critics . A critic who talks in this way about criticism is held , rightly or wrongly , to be undermining the basic position of his craft . Another reason why snide remarks about Mr. Connolly come so easily to some people 's lips is that he is , for the very reason I have just given , popular and admired among people who are the enemies of genuine discrimination and hard thinking . Like Lord David Cecil , he is to some extent a victim of the sort of people who read him . It takes a certain amount of courage , in " serious " literary circles here in England , to admit to an admiration of Mr. Connolly 's work , because to do so is to line oneself up with a vacuous and modish fringe of the literary world , obnoxious to any genuine reader or writer . Most writers who are popular are liked for the wrong reasons , and Mr. Connolly is popular because he makes epigrams and comes out with dashing judgments . " Howard 's End , written in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a postwar name ( Sebastian ) , and a simplified form of writing in full revolt against Henry James . " Apart from the dubious piece of causal reasoning here , there is no character named Sebastian in Howard 's End ; Mr. Connolly must have been thinking of Leonard Bast . But his readers , the kind of readers who take him as a weekly oracle , were unlikely to raise this kind of objection . Mr. Connolly has gone on reprinting this sentence down through the years ( it is in the present volume on p. 292 ) , and nobody has jogged his elbow ; he does n't , it seems , get the one basic privilege of every critic ? an attentive audience . There are , however , important things to be said on the credit side . To begin with , Mr. Connolly is undeniably sincere in taking up the stance of the Failed Writer . As a young man , he wrote a fresh and amazing novel , The Rock Pool , and there are passages in all his later books that could only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really does work differently from that of the pure ( not " mere " ) critic . He is not , in other words , merely saying " I could have been a writer if , " without producing any evidence : the evidence is solidly there . And the standard by which he judged himself to have " failed " is the highest one : " The more books we read , the sooner we perceive that the true function of a writer is to produce a masterpiece and that no other task is of any consequence . Obvious though this should be , how few writers will admit it , or having made the admission , will be prepared to lay aside the piece of iridescent mediocrity on which they have embarked ! Writers always hope that their next book is going to be their best , for they will not acknowledge that it is their present way of life which prevents them from ever creating anything different or better . " All of Connolly 's more sustained writing ? everything above the level of the 800-word review ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is hampered by the kind of life he finds himself living . Over twenty years ago he gave us Enemies of Promise , a critical survey of the factors working against the emergence of talent ; and one-third of the book , logically enough , was devoted to an account of his own education and upbringing , to show how the springs of imagination were silted over in his own case . Enemies of Promise was a success , and yet it also met with a harsh , contemptuous reception in some quarters , for this was the epoch of reformist zeal , the Spanish War and the Popular Front , and no one had time for an Etonian 's lament over the trampled flower of his genius . " Were I to deduce any system from my feelings on leaving Eton , " ran a much quoted passage , " it might be called The Theory of Permanent Adolescence . It is the theory that the experience undergone by boys at the great public schools , their glories and disappointments , are so intense as to dominate their lives and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Promise does not quite make its case . One feels that to say , " I could n't be a poet because the romantic dragon swallowed me while I was still at school , " is to give up a little too easily . The Failed Writer does n't convince us that he has really tried . I suspect that Mr. Connolly may have felt this himself , because a bare half-dozen years after Enemies of Promise he tackled the same theme much more resolutely in The Unquiet Grave . Here , the problems of the writer are seen as part of the whole predicament of modern man , the argument goes much deeper , and the passion which infuses the whole book raises it to the level of a work of real literary art : . Even as obscure poisons , foci of infection , septic teeth and germ-crowded colons play a part in the origins of insanity , so do slums , great cities , proletarian poverty and bourgeois boredom , or tyrannies of family and herd contribute to obscure our sense of union with the physical world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everywhere the despair , fear , hate and destruction which ulcerate our peace . Nature is banished from our civilization , the seasons lose their rhythm , the fruits of the earth their savor , the animals , co-heirs of our planet , are wantonly exterminated , the God within us is denied , and the God without . Wisdom and serenity become treasures to be concealed , and happiness a lost art . Resentment triumphs ; the frustrated ' Have-nots ' massacre the ' Haves ' . We are in fact within sight of achieving a world neurosis , a world in which atrophy of the instincts ( except that of herd-slaughter ) , abuse of the intellect , and perversion of the heart will obliterate our knowledge of the purpose of life : humanity will choke in its own bile .... When once we have discovered how pain and suffering diminish the personality , and how joy alone increases it , then the morbid attraction which is felt for evil , pain and abnormality will have lost its power . " Gone is the mere self-pity , the tendency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before . The book has a genuinely tragic element because the author convinces us of his passionate belief in art and also of his despair , his conviction that the world has wandered away from health and sanity and therefore necessarily from art , which demands both vision and confidence . There is nothing frivolous or hedonistic about such a view , and indeed Mr. Connolly 's position is not so different from that of a severe , entrenched Puritan like Dr. Leavis . For Leavis , too , holds that great art can only arise under conditions that make for spiritual health , and when it comes to damning the modern world it would be hard to choose between them . " On the one hand there is the enormous technical complexity of civilization , a complexity that could be dealt with only by an ' answering efficiency of coordination ? a cooperative concentration of knowledge , understanding and will ( and ' understanding ' means not merely a grasp of intricacies , but a perceptive wisdom about ends ) . On the other hand , the social and cultural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machinery is destroying what should have controlled the working . It is as if society , in so complicating and extending the machinery of organization , had incurred a progressive debility of consciousness and the powers of coordination and control ? had lost intelligence , memory and moral purpose . " That is Leavis on modern society ( in Education and the University , which came out in the same year as The Unquiet Grave ) ; and , behind Leavis ' condemnation of most of what has passed for English literature in his time , there lies this steady dissent from the whole drift of modern civilization . It would be fanciful to push the assimilation much further , but since Leavis and Connolly are generally supposed to represent the two opposite poles in contemporary English criticism it is just worth pointing out how much they have in common . Leavis ' distrust of the modern world has led him into his well-known hardness to please ; he would certainly agree that " the true function of a writer is to produce a masterpiece . " Mr. Connolly , ultimately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always telling us that the game is up , that no good work can possibly be done any more . After ten years of editing Horizon , he wound it up with an editorial which declared , " It is closing time in the gardens of the West and from now on an artist will be judged only by the resonance of his solitude or the quality of his despair . " The difference is that the one says it with a tear , the other with a frown ; Mr. Connolly genuinely regrets that the game is up and only wishes that the writers of his own time could rise to the true heights ; whereas Dr. Leavis too often gives the impression of a man refusing , with tightened lips and cold eyes , to be taken in by a clumsy confidence trick ; he seems to think that writers publish bad books simply in order to annoy him . I personally do not find that either of these critics make my flesh creep . Of course the world is in a horrible mess , but to deduce from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art is too much of a jump ; as long as the West can keep its political liberty , there is always a chance . And if the greatest heights do , for one reason and another , remain out of reach , we shall just have to write as well as we can , and keep our spirits up , without too much agonizing . The fifties in England have not been a decade studded with masterpieces , but they have shown a great deal of activity ; the English novel has been given a fresh impetus and so has English poetry ; the theater is more alive than it has been for Too years ; important works have appeared in the spheres of history , biography and criticism . Mr. Connolly wanders about the garden of the West , shouting " All out ! " and ringing his little bell , but no one seems to hear him . I am not saying that " time " has " proved him wrong , " or anything so high-flying ; only that the gardens of the West are still demonstrably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that he detected no sign of life , no promise for the future , in the whole mass of work produced by ? to dash down a few representative names ? William Golding , Iris Murdoch , Kingsley Amis , John Osborne , Harold Pinter , Philip Larkin . And that is to confine oneself to England , and to writers who had published nothing before 1950 . Dr. Leavis , I understand , reacts to the newer writers by a simple refusal to read them . But then Mr. Connolly , in a gentler way , also gives the impression of having given up . Since the demise of Horizon , he appears to have done very little except for his weekly column in the Sunday Times , and even there he evidently makes it a policy to avoid reviewing any but the most marginal books . He seems , in his fifties , to be seeking an honorable retirement . There may , of course , be more than one reason for this . For one thing , the writing most characteristic of the past ten years has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He likes best the Augustan age in Rome , its recreation in England and France from about 1660 to 1740 , and ( possibly as a counterbalancing opposite ) the heyday of European romanticism from 1770 to 1850 . The newer English authors he probably finds too raw , too self-sufficient ; they are apt to cut lose from the past and spin from within themselves the material for a new start . Not that Mr. Connolly can blame them for this . In 1944 he gave it as his opinion that the novel was played out . " Flaubert , Henry James , Proust , Joyce and Virginia Woolf have finished off the novel . Now all will have to be reinvented as from the beginning . " But when the reinventing was done , Mr. Connolly was not among those who cheered ; and for an evident reason . The result was too conservative , not experimental enough . Just as he had predicted , a generation of writers appeared who did not try to continue the work of James , Proust , Joyce et al . ( And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , inclining to the view that that particular tip had been a mistake . ) Older models , neglected for a century , were reverted to . A knockabout realist like Smollet became more of an " influence " than Proust . Mr. Amis , the most widely admired new writer of the ' fifties , wrote straightforward comedy of manners that would not have seemed unfamiliar to Fanny Burney . It is here that we circle back to the Etonian chapter in Enemies of Promise and see the effect on Mr. Connolly of his education . Eton seems to have given him a sense of ripeness , of the completeness of a culture to which nothing could ever be added . " My favorite books of the Old Testament were Ecclesiastes and the Wisdom of Solomon in which I recognized the melancholy and tired distinction of an old race . " Dangerous recognition for a boy of eighteen ! To this day Mr. Connolly 's favorite writers are all those who show an understanding of the historical process that has brought certain qualities to fulness and held back others . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he writes in The Unquiet Grave , " they imitated them at a time when the flowering of Roman civilization demanded just such a refinement , a taking over of the trusteeship of the past by the swelling Latin genius . In that sense every writer refashions the literature of the past and produces his tiny commentary , nothing is ever quite new ; but there comes a moment when a whole culture ripens and prepares to make its own versions of the great art of its predecessors . " Notice the words here which remind one of the Iife-cycle of fruit and vegetables : " the swelling Latin genius , " " a whole culture ripens . " Probably if Mr. Connolly had to find a metaphor descriptive of present-day English writing , he would call it green , sour , productive only of " berries harsh and crude . " And in fact there is a sense in which all English literature seems to him rough , unripe , the produce of an ungainly people " bent resolutely on wringing lilies from the corn . " He has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maturity and poise of the great sun-drenched cultures , beginning with Greece and Rome and going on to present-day France and Spain , are always present in his mind as a contrast to the more rugged virtues of the English imagination . Neither the life nor the literature of England really satisfies him . In this respect he resembles Lawrence Durrell , another Irishman and a man of about the same generation ; Durrell spent the first few years of his life in India , coming to England only to go to school , and the hot sun , strong colors and midday languor of . India have evidently stayed in his bones , making England depressing to him with its cool , rain-washed landscape and misty emotions . The result : a life spent mainly abroad , on the shores of the Mediterranean , and The Alexandria Quartet . In Mr. Connolly 's case , one is not surprised to hear , there was a similar exposure to the sun in early life , when his father 's regiment was ordered to South Africa . " The freezias grew wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wayward creamy blossom , and their fragrance , so strangely fresh and yet sophisticated , were my first clue to the vast riches of the universe ... there were chameleons in the garden and squashed apricots ; on Sundays the Regiment had church parades and there were smells of pine and eucalyptus paint blisters and hot tar . " So , after all , Mr. Connolly 's aesthetic sensibilities are one of the by-products of the Boer War . A strange thought ! But in the end , of course , we come back to Eton . It is never wise to develop a boy 's intelligence as if under glass . Most English public schools are in no danger of doing this ; they are simply places where a boy learns to take cold humanistic tradition on its more forward pupils , making them free of a full-blown , sophisticated literary culture that either sinks them altogether or , if they manage to survive and become writers , gives them that characteristic Etonian brilliance , a kind of shimmer on the surface of everything they write . Fielding , Gray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of minor writers like Dolben , Swinburne and Bridges ; Mr. Connolly has it very markedly . Too markedly , that is the trouble . The over-sated quality that marked his literary sensibilities as an Eton schoolboy was already a danger-sign . Oxford , which seemed to him merely an anticlimax ( " The world of matey young men with their pipes and gray bags , the blokeries to which we had been allotted , filled us with despair " ) was not enough of a change ; it did not even take him out of the relaxing , dream-inducing climate of the Thames Valley . Cambridge ( either Cambridgeshire or Massachusetts ) would have been better . So it is , I think , an excellent thing for American readers to have Enemies of Promise as a paperback ; after twenty-odd years the book still leads us authoritatively into its own world . And after all , these notes on Mr. Connolly are not intended as an obituary . He may seem , at present , to have withdrawn from anything like an active part in the struggle to maintain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and above all he has generosity . He may yet surprise us.
