The Good Neighbor policy was all right for the ' 30s , and the Alliance for Progress has been a step forward in the ' 60s . But in the ' 70s we need something more . <P> - Galo Plaza <P> RICHARD NIXON 'S first official foreign visitor in the White House last January was Galo Plaza , Secretary General of the Organization of American States , and there was a sense of urgency in his call . U.S. relations with the nations to the south were at their lowest ebb in years . The U.S.-conceived Alliance for Progress had been a disappointment , if not an outright failure , and many disillusioned Latin Americans were seriously asking whether the U.S. , preoccupied with Viet Nam and domestic crises , really cared . Not until last week , after more than nine months of reassessment , did Nixon give his answer . " We do care , " he told Latin America . " I care . " The President could hardly have said less . But how much did he care ? And in what ways ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a sedate and pragmatic U.S. approach to relations with its neighbors . Businesslike and low-keyed , his proposals were a far cry-and , some felt , a refreshingly realistic departure-from the soaring vision of John Kennedy 's Alliance or the " Decade of Urgency " that Lyndon Johnson proclaimed at the conference of hemisphere Presidents in Punta del Este , Uruguay , more than two years ago . <P> Listening More . The President 's policy , outlined before the Inter-American Press Association in Washington , called for a more balanced partnership rather than an American-dominated alliance . From now on , the President promised , the U.S. would listen more and lecture less ; it would be " guided by a healthy awareness that give-and-take is better than take-it-or-leave-it . " <P> Nixon drew some of his recommendations from the findings of New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller , who earlier this year visited 20 hemisphere nations ( TIME , July 11 ) . Rocky 's report , to be released soon , was described in Washington as considerably more far-reaching than Nixon 's guidelines . During his tour , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only with the slow pace of development but also with the often domineering , paternalistic attitudes and policies of the <P> U.S. Such sentiments are fueling a relatively new , vibrant nationalism of both right and left that frequently finds expression in strident anti-Americanism . <P> " We have heard many voices from Latin America in these first months of our new Administration-voices of hope , voices of concern , voices of frustration , " Nixon declared . " They have told us that if our partnership is to thrive , or even to survive , we must recognize that the nations of Latin America must go forward in their own way , under their own leadership . I recognize the concerns , and I share many of them . "
