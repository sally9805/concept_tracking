What do Archibald Lee Wright , Walker Smith , Rocco Francis Marchegiano , Arnold Raymond Cream , Joseph Louis Barrow and Carmine Tilelli have in common with Cassius Marcellus Clay ? They all were boxing champions who preferred to be known by their aliases* rather than by their proper names . The resemblance ends in the general vicinity of the mouth . <P> Once Clay confined himself to spouting poetry and proclaiming " I am the greatest . " Then he won the world heavyweight championship , joined the Black Muslims , changed his name to Muhammad Ali-and his loquaciousness turned to logorrhea . He railed bitterly against the U.S. war effort in Viet Nam and set out to dodge the draft . <P> He insulted his opponents : Sonny Listen was " an ugly bear " ; Floyd Patterson was " a chump " ; George Chuvalo was " a washerwoman . " Last week , Cassius Clay reached a peak-of sorts . In Manhattan to publicize his Feb. 6 title fight with Ernie Terrell , he flew completely off the handle when Terrell casually referred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you call me Clay ? " he screamed . " You know my right name is Muhammad Ali . It takes an Uncle Tom Negro to call me by my slave name . <P> You 're an Uncle Tom ! I 'm going to make you an example to the world ! " <P> With that , Clay flung off his jacket and threw a left , which Terrell , luckily perhaps , deflected with an arm . Then Cassius angrily stalked away , accompanied by three Black Muslim bodyguards . <P> Terrell just shook his head and murmured : " He 's an idiot . Just an idiot . " <P> <P> * Archie Moore , Sugar Ray Robinson , Rocky Marciano , Jersey Joe Walcott , Joe Louis and Joey Giardello.
