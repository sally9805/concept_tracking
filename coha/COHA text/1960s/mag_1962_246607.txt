The Legend of Lobo . In 1897 , according to one educated estimate , about 500,000 head of cattle and sheep were slaughtered by wolves in the U.S. West . Understandably , the ranchmen waged all-out war against wolves , and toward the end of the last century thousands of the bloody brutes were trapped or shot or poisoned every year . But no matter how many were killed , there was always the big one that got away . In New Mexico his name was Lobo , and Lobo was a brute half again as big as he had any natural right to be , with a roar like a lion and a paw like a bear and a cunning that made hunters old before their time . His legend still lives in the great Southwest , lives in every boy who ever read Lobo , The King of Currumpaw by Ernest Thompson Seton . Now it lives in something more than full color and something less than full credibility in this True Life Adventure by Walt Disney . <P> To hear Disney tell it , wolves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's because people make them that way . Take Lobo . Why , when he started out he was just the cutest little pup you ever saw , but along came a bounty hunter and shot his mother , and poor little Lobo was forced to become a lone wolf . Naturally , he killed a few cows now and then , and why not ? Man had eliminated the buffalo , and Gro-Pup does n't grow on trees . But his private life was exemplary . When he grew up he fell in love at first bite and became a thoroughly respectable meat-winner . <P> The story is just plain silly , and the singer feller on the sound track ( " Lobo , Lobo , remember this day/Man 's bullets have taken your mother away " ) is. even harder to take . But the film was shot in Arizona , and frame after frame is crammed with some of the most magnificent scenery on the planet . What 's more , the hunting scenes-notably one in which an old wolf elegantly cuts a calf out of its herd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty and the horror that inevitably attend a blood rite .
