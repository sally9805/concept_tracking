THE task of covering the new war in Asia has , for U.S. publications , an uncommon advantage : it is possible to cover both sides . Yet that advantage carries with it a particular problem-melding the reports into a clear story that gives the whole picture . It is for just such a situation that TIME 'S way of handling the news is particularly suited . <P> On the Indian side , New Delhi Bureau Chief Marvin Zim moved through the tense capital to keep in close touch with the government 's moves at the top . Correspondent James Shepherd , for whom the conflict brought rather sharp memories of 1947 when he covered the opening shots in the Kashmir dispute , was the first reporter to reach the city of Amritsar after the major Indian thrust started there . At midweek , Tokyo Bureau Chief Jerrold Schecter covered the opening of Hello , Dolly ! and then flew to India to join the war team . <P> To cover the Pakistan side , Correspondent Louis Kraar , who recently completed a two-year assignment in the area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bangkok , flew into Rawalpindi and on to the front . Rome Correspondent William Rademaekers , who had been covering the comparatively quiet political crisis in Greece , flew out of Athens for Karachi and went right to work when he found United Nations Secretary-General U Thant on the same plane . <P> As the files from the five corre spondents-plus reports from the United Nations , Washington and London bureaus-poured into New York , Writer Robert McLaughlin worked out that special problem of making a whole story of all the parts . For Artist Boris Chaliapin , the solution was more direct . He saw the new war represented in the ancient terms of two clashing 17th century Indian scimitars -a rather elegant reminder that the conflict is as old as it is new .
