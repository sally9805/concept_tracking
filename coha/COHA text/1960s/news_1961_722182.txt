txt New York City labor leaders promised today to back with money and picket lines the effort of Local 3 of the International Brotherhood of Electricians to shorten the work week . Harry Van Arsdale Jr. , head of Local 3 and the New York City Central Labor Council , ? said yesterday that his union would ! strike on New Year 's Day tol win a twenty-hour week . Such a stoppage would hit millions of dollars worth of building construction in New York City and , might ultimately black out street and traffic lights . Support for a cut in hours was pledged by the Shorter Work Week Committee of the Labor Council , which represents more than 1,000 local unions . ? Policy Drawn Up The committee is headed by David Sullivan , president of the Building Service Employees International Union . Mr. Sullivan 's committee has been at work for more than a year on a shorter-work-week policy for New York labor . Local 3 represents electricians in the city . Under the policy the group will throw unlimited financial , moral and picket-line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut in work hours and that promises to remain out until it has achieved its objective . The eleven-man executive board of Local 3 , which was called here last week for anl emergency session by Mr. Van Arsdale , agreed last night to undertake the first test case for the committee . The final decision on a strike will be made this Thursday in New York by the union 's membership . Under the committee 's rules , it would not be necessary for Local 3 to hold out for the fourhour day in order to quality for the backing of other unions in the Central Labor Council . It would need only to win a cut in the present contractual six-hour day , which the union has had for twenty-seven years . The Van Arsdale fight for a shorter week is supported by Gordon Freeman , international president of the Electrical Union , and Joseph D. Keenan , secretary-treasurer of the group . Local 3 is the organization 's largest affiliate . Mr. Van Arsdale 's drive for the shorter work week is in direct defiance of the Kennedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the convention of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations , President Kennedy called for responsible bargaining to hold the wage-price line . On Friday Secretary of Labor Arthur J. Goldberg underscored this view and added that there was " plenty of room " for wage increases under the Administration 's economic policies . The Administration 's attitude on a , cut in the generally prevalent forty-hour week is that a shorter week would not be a good idea now because of its possible effect on America 's foreign commitments and on ' the domestic economic system . But many segments of labor believe that only by limiting hours can hard-core unemployment and the threat of automation be limited . ' The local 's last general strike was in 1941 , when a fourteenday walkout affected $14,000 , - 000 in private construction . The strike was an outgrowth of a dispute with the Consolidated Edison Company . It was the first general strike by the union ' , since 1907 . Negotiations between Local 3 and four employer associations , representing 600 contracts , began Oct. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made no offer , and he hinted that the Building Trades Employers Association was prepared to use a mutual assistance fund to support the electrical companies in the event of a strike . The union is seeking a wage increase of 40 cents an hour and other benefits in addition to the cut in hours . At present the 9,000 electricians who would go on strike , are paid $4.40 an hour . In addition they receive fringe benefits that cost their employers 14 per cent of their weekly wages . Management also pays into an annuity fund $4 a day for each worker . Members have worked a seventh hour at overtime rates in recent years because of a shortage of skilled electricians . High A. F. L.-C . I. O. sources here said they knew nothing about the New York attempt to break through for the shorter work week . George Meany , A. F. L.-C . I. 0 . president , pledged " 1,000 per cent " cooperation to President Kennedy after his speech here Thursday . Hoffa Against ' Freeze ' Meanwhile , James R. Hoffa , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not go along with " any wage freeze . " Mr. Hoffa , who met here last week with his Executive Board , said major contract settlements recently completed by the Teamsters called for wage increases of sixteen cents an hour over the next three years . But , he added , many other agreements covering thousands of workers are still being negotiated . He said the Teamsters would seek the same 16-cent figure . " Goldberg , " Mr. Hoffa said , " has no right to come down here and tell labor how to bargain . " Mr. Hoffa also demanded that Secretary Goldberg " keep his nose out of our business . " Mr. Goldberg in a speech here Friday , urged the A. F. L.-C . I. 0 . convention not to readmit the Teamsters . The truck union was expelled in 1957 on charges of Corruption . City Urges Talks City Labor Commissioner Harold A. Felix asked yesterday that the electricians and builders negotiate this week on a contract that would prevent a strike threatened for Jan. 1 . Mr. Felix said he had directed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both sides today and line up a joint meeting as quickly as possible . Street and traffic lights are maintained for the city by the Broadway Maintenance Corporation , whose employes are members of Local 3.
