When housing does well , so do a lot of other industries : steel , lumber , glass , appliances and furniture . So far in the ' 60s , housing has proved a disappointment . As the spring home-buying season opened in earnest last week , the figures for housing starts in January and February showed only a 3% rise over the same months last year , a disappointing gain that is being blamed on a hard winter . But there are portents of better things to come . Permits for future building jumped 8% in the two months , and FORTUNE 'S semiannual survey reports that builders plan to put up 17% more houses and apartment units this year than last , or 1,670,000 altogether . <P> One stimulant to increased homebuilding is cheap and plentiful mortgage money , largely the result of a 14% rise in savings deposits in Federal Reserve member banks in the past year . Overloaded with savings that they must put to work , bankers in the past four months have cut mortgage rates by % or % ; in many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At 5% or 6% , almost anyone can get a 25-year mortgage covering 75% or more of his cost .

What many want is two-story houses , which are better buys than rambling ranches because they occupy less land ( prices for lots have jumped an average 190% since 1947 ) . Buyers are also less eager these days for picture windows , which add to bills for heating and draperies . <P> New housing construction is particularly strong in Philadelphia , Baltimore , Washington . D.C .. and San Francisco , has also picked up in Atlanta , New Orleans , Detroit , Phoenix and Seattle . In many places , builders try to attract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to charge extra for : wall-to-wall carpeting , fully equipped kitchens , swimming pools and . in San Francisco , even sauna baths . This is largely in response to the challenge from apartment builders , who woo potential homeowners with such inducements as free moving , a bonus of trading stamps , several months ' free rent or even free furniture . Too many new apartment houses have been built in many areas , but apartments are still expected to account for one-third of 1963 's housing starts .
