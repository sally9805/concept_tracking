txt Income from the city 's general fund taxes in the last six months is running about 16 per cent higher than in the same period last year and should yield a surplus for the current fiscal year , Finance Administrator Fioravante G. Perrotta said yesterday . The rise was attributed by fiscal officials to a combination of higher employment , increased business activity , and inflationary rises in the cost of living and salaries , which push up the yield of sales and income taxes . In the city 's fiscal newsletter , published quarterly over Mayor Lindsay 's signature , Mr. Perrotta reported that local nonreal estate taxes , including sales , business , and personal income levies , were all greater than for the last six months of 1967. $100-Million Surplus If these increased rates of yield continue for the coming six months , city officials expect a general fund surplus of at least $100-million over what was estimated at the beginning of the fiscal year . But these officials were quick to note that this anticipated surplus would be completely consumed by rising welfare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final half of this fiscal year ending July I. The largest revenue rise in the last six months has been in stock transfer tax collections . These rose by 21 per cent over the last half of 1967 to a total of $141-million .

The fiscal newsletter is sent to bankers and investors throughout the nation . One of its principal purposes is to chronicle the general state of the city 's fiscal health and to impress Its readers with the city 's credit status . Looking forward to the coming fiscal year , the letter warned that the Mayor was anticipating a gap of $500-million between what the city would like to spend for operations arid the revenue it expected from general fund and real estate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plan Noted The news letter also notes Governor Rockefeller 's proposal for a 5 per cent over-all cutback in state aid " State law requires the city to balance its budget , " the letter declared . " So any substantial cutback in state aid will compel the city either to seek new sources of revenue or to curtail the services it renders . " In the language of the taxpayer , this means that the city will either have to reduce some municipal activities or raise local taxes . The Ietter adds , however , that this does not apply to what the city builds or to the equipment it buys for its departments .

For the same period in 1967 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beginning of this fiscal year , to yield about $1.5-billion. will exceed $1.6-billion . Because of seasonal changes in some general fund taxes , the amount collected in the next six months will not necessarily double the $849.7-million . But it is expected that the total will exceed $1.600-billion . Budget Director Frederick O'R . Hayes has estimated that welfare in the coming six months would he at least $110-million more than anticipated in the current budget and that salaries and benefits for municipal workers would be at least $45-million more than expected . The surplus anticipated in general fund revenues will cover part of this . The remainder will come , Mr. Hayes has said , from increases in Federal and state aid based on current aid firmuIas.
