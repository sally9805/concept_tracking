There is no record of Father Divine 's age , but it has been estimated at about 100 . Mother Divine , his second wife , was present at the death of her husband , who was reI garded as immortal by many of his followers . The attending physician , Dr. Joseph A. Wagner , said Father Divine 's death was caused by lung congestion , the result of arteriosclerosis and diabetes mellitus . J. Austin Norris , Father Divine 's lawyer , said there would be a public viewing beginning at 10 A.M. Sunday at Woodmont , where Father Divine 's followers today opened a threeday observance of the 12th anniversary of the mansion 's dedication and consecration as " the Mount of the Home of the Lord . " Other arrangements for the funeral are expected to be completed tomorrow .

Father Divine , a Negro , recFather Divine in 1961 photo ognized no distinction of race . Mother Divine and many of his followers were white . Mr. Norris said the movement kept no membership records and there was no way to estimate the total . In reply to a question as to who would now lead the movement , Mr. Norris said " Mother Divine will carry on as she has been for the past year during Father Divine 's illness . " Asked if there would be a reorganization as a result of the leader 's death Mr. Norris said : " In this movement , they believe that Father Divines physical presence is not necessary . His death is only the throwing off of the physical body and he is still the leader of the movement . " Mr. Norris estimated the value of the cult 's property at more than al ? million , including holdings in New York , New Jersey , Philadelphia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed Father Divine to be extremely wealthy , he actually owned nothing , " Mr. Norris said . " He paid no income tax and he will leave no estate . " Wore $500 Silk Suite Father Divine 's height was 5 feet 2 inches , and his customary dress was a carefully tailored $500 silk suit . He was bald and paunchy . His face was round and cherubic . His eyes were soft and doelike . His voice was lilting and persuasive . His rhetoric was replete with malapropisms and many of his sentences seemed virtually unintelligible . However , to thousands who looked upon him and heard him speak , Father Divine was God Almighty , who had arrived full grown on earth in a puff of smoke ( he once gave the date as " the time of Abraham " ) to divulge a creed of peace , communal living , celibacy , honesty and racial equality . The movement was called the Kingdom of Peace , but for all its spiritual aspects it was most decidedly of this world . Although the Kingdom of Peace 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limousines and freedom from material want , and of divinity as the reverence of his followers in the United States , Europe , Africa and Australia , he did not specifically declare that he was God . " I do n't have to say I 'm God , and I do n't have to say I 'm not God , " he once remarked . " I said there are thousands of people call me God . Millions of them . And there are millions of them call me the Devil , and I do n't say I am God , and I do n't say I am the Devil , But I produce Cod and shake the earth with it . " Accepted His Divinity This disclaimer apart , Father Divine accepted without apparrent qualm the assertion of his followers that he was God . On the walls of the movement 's missions and houses ( they were once called " Heavens " ) the banners read " Father Divine Is , God . " In his correspondence and in his weekly newspaper , New Day , references to Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of divinity in the words he used to sign his letters , These subscriptions read ; " This leaves me well , healthy , joyful , peaceful , lively , loving , successful , prosperous and happy in spirit , body and mind and in every organ , muscle , sinew , ' joint , limb , vein and bone , and in every atom , fiber and cell of my bodily form , " As for defining God , Father Divine said : " God is not only personified and materialized . He is repersonified and rematerialized . He rematerialized and He rematerialates . He rematerialates and He is rematerializatable . He repersonificates and He repersonifitizes . " In practice , Father Divine fostered a mass cooperative , a primitive communism , based on the Last Supper . The banquet table , often laden with as many as 50 different viands , was a religious symbol . No Formal Service There were songs and impromptu sermons , but no formal service , no Scriptural reading and no clergy . " Peace , it 's won ' derful " was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " peace " rather than " hello " and " good-by " was the word of greeting and departure for members of the Kingdom . Father Divine promulgated a belief that those who joined his Kingdom entered upon a new life , and this accounted for his followers ' discarding their family names for such cognomens as Peaceful Samuel , Victory Love , Miss Charity , Holy Quietness and Positive Love . Along with a change of name ( which was not mandatory ) there was a change of conduct ( which was mandatory ) . Father Divine did not permit his followers to smoke tobacco , drink liquor or use cosmetics ; he banned the use of obscene language ; he barred attendance ' at the movies and at stage plays and he interdicted the acceptance of gifts or tips . Moreover , Father Divine ruled out undue mixing of the sexes , ' but he did countenance spiritual marriage , citing his own second marriage as an example . This occurred in 1946 , when he Iniarried Miss Ritchings , a 21-'year-old Canadian stenographer . Named Sweet Angel Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sweet Angel , was married to Father Divine secretly in Washington . The event was disclosed three months later at a lanolin banquet at Woodmont , the kingdom 's 32-room manor house . Introducing his wife as " the Spotless Virgin Bride , " Father Divine explained that they were united " in name only " because " God is not married . " More significant from a doctrinal point of view , Father Divine announced that he had transferred the spirit of his first wife , a Negro , into the person of his second  --  and he proclaimed that they were one and the same . Thereupon , perhaps looking to his own eventual bodily disappearance from the earth , he said that henceforth his spirit would be possessed by Mother Divine , The byword in the Kingdom of Peace was , " Father will proaide . " Judging from the chants ' of " Thank you , Father , thank you " and the murmurs of ; Amen , brother , " Father Divine United Press International Mother Divine in 1958 photo did provide both spiritually and materially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but also food and lodging . Rooms at Kingdom hotels and missions cost as little as $5 a week , with meals at about 35 cents apiece . Indigent followers slept and ate free . The low-cost service originated in the Depression years , and it undoubtedly helped to attract followers . The price of a meal then , was a nickel . Father Held No Property Countering the material benefits of the Kingdom of Peace was the fact that those ted to it placed their money and property at the Kingdom 's disposal , Father Divine , however , was said not to have held any property in his own name , nor did he have a bank account . The movement 's riches were compounded from the donations of its members . Father Divine 's attitude toward sex was that it was an evil of the flesh . Explaining this , he said : " Those that are living according to my teaching , they are redeemed from self-indulgence and sex indulgence , human affection , lust and passion and all those detestable tendencies , Some real estate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subdivision of the Kingdom of Peace . The title to other properties was held in the names of followers , with some parcels having as many as 500 owners . Woodmont , the movement 's showpiece , was called " The Country Seat of the World . " Father Divine took up residence there in 1942 after departing what he regarded as an ingrateful New York and scores of process servers . More than 75 estates or hotels of varying degrees of opulence were included in the United States realm of the Kingdom of Peace . In Philedelphia , these included the Tracy and Lorraine Hotels . There was also the Fairmount Hotel in Jersey City , and a large estate overlooking the Hudson River at Krum Elbow in New York . Married couples living in these hotels and estates were separated . Established on L. L These estates were the outgrowth of the " Heavens , " the first of which was established at Sayville , L. L , in 1919 . The eight-room house was purchased by " Major J. Devine ; " it was the only property ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is modest by comparison with that in Gladwyne , lower Merlon , with its tennis courts and outdoor swimming pool and its 22-karat gold dinner services , its silver tea services , rosewood furniture and oriental rugs . His movement grew rapidly in the nineteen-thirties and forties when Father Divine was speaking frequently and voluminously . New Day , his weekly , was full of his speeches , sermons and interviews on topical events . Since 1955 , however , the newspaper has been devoted almost entirely to reprints of earlier talks . Explaining this , one of his aides said recently : " Father has said everything there is to say about everything . " Among the things about which Father Divine " said everything " was atomic energy . " I am the author and the finisher of atomic energy . I have , harnessed it , " he announced in 1945 when the United States dropped the first atom bomb on Hiroshima . He propounded the secret of personality by saying : " The individual is the personification of that which expresses personification . Thereforehe comes to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is the personal expression of it and the personification of the prepersonification of God Almighty ! Peace , it 's wonderful ! " Of his Kingdom of Peace , he remarked : " This is an impersonal Movement and it is not bound to an organization . It is enveloping the world the same as the light of civilization from the Christian movement . It does not belong to Me alone as a Person any more than the light of civilization belongs to an individual . It is impersonal by nature , impersonal in its characteristics and impersonal in its activities . " Although Father Divine in , sisted on enveloping his corporeal history ( and his age ) in mystery , there is some evidence that he was born George Baker in 1877 on Hutchinson 's Island in the Savannah River in Georgia . From childhood he worked around Georgia and , later , Maryland , at odd jobs for 50 cents a ' day . Just before the turn of the century , he lived in East Baltimore , and was preaching in little Sunday schools around town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a disciple to Sam Mon ris , a Pennsylvania Negro who was trying to sell the idea that he was " father Jehovia . " Two years later George Baker switched over to John Hickerson 's " Live Ever , Die Never " group . Then he returned to Valdosta in Georgia to promote himself along these lines . Official Valdosta somewhat irritated , booked Mr. Baker as " John Doe , alias God , " and tried him as a public nuisance . The choice of leaving Georgia or going to an insane asylum was given him . He quit Georgia in February , 1914 . He headed then for New York . In 1915 a few Valdosta followers served and supported him in a run-down house in West 40th Street . As a sideline to his godly activities , he was their employment agent ; he got them jobs as cooks , valets , waiters and laundry help . About this time he began to encourage his followers to believe that they could never die while they believed in him . When a Devineite came down with something likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Major J. Devine " ? would turn the follower out of the " Heaven . " Dropped in sonic nearby flat , these unfortunates would be picked up by a city hospital , and would eventually go to " potter 's field . Father Divine could truthfully say , " No one dies in My House , " and his followers spread this word , to his advantage . When other followers showed signs of mental breakdown , as they frequently did , they too , landed in city hosPitalsilai. 1 Term Follows Feast In 1931 the following had grown so large and was so noisy at the Sayville feasts , especially on weekends , that the police haled Father Divine before Justice Lewis T. Smith as a public nuisance . On Nov. 16 , the justice sentenced him to six-months in jail and fined him $500 . Four days later the justice died of a heart attack . Father Divine was quoted saying then : " I hated to do it ! " In recent years , Father Divine was seldom seen in public , and there were frequent reports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admitted for a week to Bryn Mawr Hospital . The diagnosis was diabetic coma . Hospital records then listed him as Frederick Devoe and put his age at 80 . Whether this was his name or whether it was Baker was uncertain . All that his associates would say was : " George Baker is the name given him by his enemies . "
