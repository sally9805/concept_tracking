txt President Nixon and his aides will certainly be watching American reaction to the latest announcement of troop withdrawals . Not like hawks  --  or doves  --  but from their in-between position . It is greatly hoped at the White House that Americans will accept the present rate of slow withdrawal . Otherwise Hanoi will continue to refuse mutual withdrawal , confident that the American public wild , force the President to pull out much faster . The White House used the figure that will look most impressive to the public : a total of 60,000 troops withdrawn by mid-December . But Hanoi can be expected to calculate that this is a very slow pace . At less than 12,000 a month , this would leave nearly half the U.S. Army in Vietnam at the time of next year'i November elections . And the North Vietnamese might figure that the President , with elections ? past , might decide to stop withdrawing troops at that point , unless Hanoi had agreed to mutual withdrawal . The President needs a minimal public approval to put pressure on Hanoi to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vietnam and Laos will stop ? if Hanoi 's new leaders continue to reduce the level of violence and show a willingness to compromise . Meanwhile , the United States stands prepared to discuss compromise , beyond the formal proposals it has already made . This is one meaning of the 36-hour halt in the bombings after the pause during the funeral of Ho Chi Minh . The White House has clearly signaled- this message to Hanoi by more than one means . Pressure from the news media is building for another Nixon press conference soon . And for more frequent availability of the President to the press . It was June 19 when Mr. Nixon held his last formal press conference . He did hold a background press briefing at Guam July 25 . But it centered chiefly on his Asian tour , then in progress , and was not for direct quotation . Access to the President at reasonably frequent intervals is consideredby.the press to be absolutely essential . ' An active presidency pioduces many issues which reporters can not cover i-esponsibly without information from the top man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reporters has become less frequent . Franklin D. Roosevelt , who put the presidential press conference on its present verbal Q and A footing , was different . He usually held two press conferences a week . Look for a Capitol Hill move shortly to force senators and congressmen to tell all about their personal finances . Early this year Sens . Clifford:P . Case and Philip A. Hart introduced a bill ? as they have before  --  to require such full disclosure . Some congressmen applauded . A few bellowed . Many squirmed silently . And the Senate . Committee on Rules and Administration bottled the bill up in a subcommittee . The Case-Hart strategy was to wait until fall ? so no one could accuse them of not giving the subcommittee a chance to act . A month ago the . duo asked subcommittee chairman Sen. Howard W. Cannon to hold hearings ; they say they never received a reply . Soon they 'll probably move to force the full Senate to vote on the issue ? by tacking their bill onto some other measure . Two points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Fortas affair , and the fact that the passing of Sen. Everett McKinley Dirksen removes from the Senate the leader of the opposition to this measure . But even if the bill should pass the Senate , the House hurdle lies ahead . And there its future is at best uncertain . How and why . . . Despite three consecutive defeats , Senate critics of military spending insist they 've done some winning , too . For months the critics had the field ' to themselves , as they decried Pentagon spending policies . But when things came to a vote , supporters of the military once again rallied their fo.rces . They defeated critics ' attempts to cut research funds for a new manned bomber , to prevent production of another nuclear-powered aircraft carrier , to halt further purchases of the giant C-5A cargo planes . But critics of the military maintain they have won victories , too . They ascribe the Pentagon 's trimming of $3 billion from its own budget at least partly to their pressure . They also claim credit for a Navy study to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible future conflicts . And most importantly , they say , the military from now on will look more closely at its own spending policies .
