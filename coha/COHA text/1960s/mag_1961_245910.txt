A State That Can Hardly Wait <P> ON the long , soggy peninsula where Ponce de Leon once sought the fountain of youth and Wilson Mizner in the 19203 ordained his palaces of pleasure , winds of change are stirring with gale force . Florida , ending one of its balmiest winters in history , last week greeted the spread of spring across the North with remarkable equanimity . Once the northward exodus of tourists in the springtime rated with the hurricanes as a natu ral catastrophe , inevitably followed by a summer-long slump . Now Florida is the focus of a permanent population shift that has made it the fastest-growing state in the Union and a bustling , year-round center of industry , commerce and building . <P> More than 3,000 new residents pour into Florida every week , and 76% of them come to settle permanently . In the ' 503 . Florida 's population grew 79% ( v. 19% for the U.S. as a whole ) , outpacing every other state . Last year its new citizens demanded 104,000 new dwellings , a pace that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ county . New industries are pouring in ( 881 new plants last year alone ) , and the state 's income from manufacturing , farming and construction finally equals the income from its weather-dependent tourist and service industries . Beyond Florida 's tawdry nightclubs , neon fagades and kidney-shaped swimming pools lies a new and sustaining domain of factories , fresh communities and solid citizens . <P> Like its banyan tree , which drops roots from its branches to anchor itself firmly in the earth , Florida is reaching out to broaden its growing base . No longer does the state suggest a congeries of retired queen bees , living unproductive Jives on husbands ' insurance and making the worker bees who serve them miserable with demanding , captious ways and parsimonious tips . Florida has become a boiling melting pot , mixing retired Ohioans with young Michiganders , New Englanders with Hoosiers . The state now boasts not only the world 's largest shuffleboard club ( in St. Petersburg ) but its largest missile testing ground ( at Cape Canaveral ) , and air-conditioned jails for its increasing criminal population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spinach . Though the state 's fast growth has relieved Florida of its worry about the tourist exodus , it has brought a tangle of new problems . For one . the need for highways is pressing . The state has built 500 miles of four-lane roads in the past five years , but that does not begin to fill the need . Says newly elected Governor Farris Bryant : " We are a score of years and a billion dollars behind in highway construction . " As fast as industry is coming into Florida , it still is not coming fast enough to supply the new jobs that the state needs for its burgeoning population . Just to keep ahead of unemployment-which is now at a 9.6% rate for nonagricultural workers-the state needs more than 25,000 new jobs every year . <P>
