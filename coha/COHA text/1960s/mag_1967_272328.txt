In case there was any doubt , the U.S. Court of Military Appeals made it clear last week that the U.S. Constitution extends to men in uniform . Answering a contention by the Navy 's Judge Advocate General that " military law is in nowise affected by constitutional limitations , " the court said , " The time is long since past when this court will lend an attentive ear to the argument that members of the armed forces are , by reason of their status , ipso facto deprived of all protections of the Bill of Rights . " <P> With that , the highest military court applied Miranda v. Arizona to the armed forces . The case at hand involved a long-shot quirk . On May 1 , 1966 , Airman Third Class Michael Tempia was detained for making obscene statements to three 10-year-old girls in a ladies ' room at Dover Air Force Base , Del . Under military law , Tempia was advised that he would have a right to free military counsel-but only after being charged . After Tempia admitted the offense , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it so happened , after the Supreme Court announced in Miranda that every civilian suspect is entitled to free counsel before being questioned . <P> At the trial , Tempia 's attorney duly objected that Miranda had voided his confession . Even so , the confession was admitted , and Tempia was sentenced to six months ' hard labor , loss of pay , reduction in rank and a bad-conduct discharge . In reversing his conviction , the Court of Military Appeals ruled that from now on G.I.s are entitled to free counsel before any questioning starts .
