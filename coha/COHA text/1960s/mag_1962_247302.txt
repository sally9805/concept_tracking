Around the entire perimeter of Angola 's breezy seaport capital of Luanda ran an illuminated wire fence . Portuguese patrols checked every car entering and leaving the city . To the north , near the Congolese border , Portuguese army units beat through the 12-ft. - high elephant grass , warily on the watch for ambush ; overhead , planes from Portugal 's antiquated air force rolled lazily , occasionally dropping firebombs into the impenetrable forests to smoke out the enemies they knew were there . <P> The enemies are the 5,000 black terrorists , organized and led from Leopoldville in the neighboring Congo by expatriate Angolan Nationalist Leader Holden Roberto , who has kept the revolt against Portugal 's harsh colonial rule simmering for 17 months . Convinced by their witch doctors that Portuguese bullets would turn to water , and smeared with white paste that they thought would make them invisible , the rebels last year began an orgy of terror . Armed with machetes and crude rifles made from pipe , old cans and rubber bands , they mutilated their victims because of the native belief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men 's penises were chopped off and nailed to trees , women were impaled on sticks . One coffee plantation owner was forced to watch while his dead wife and children were fed into a buzz saw . <P> The Portuguese retaliated with a vengeance , killed ten blacks for every white man murdered ; since the rebellion began , some 1,300 whites and 13,000 blacks have died violently . Portugal poured troops into the colony until it had quintupled its garrisons ( to 40,000 ) . Slowly they restored a semblance of order ; now the war has settled into a sporadic series of guerrilla ambushes and sniping skirmishes . <P> Badly scared by the savagery of the rebellion , Portugal has begun to ease some of the more repressive practices that provoked it . But after a swing through the troubled land , TIME Correspondent Lee Griggs reports that Angola is still virtually a feudal Portuguese fief-and a tinderbox for further revolt . <P> Diluted Apartheid . Tentatively , the Portuguese have begun a resettlement program in the north aimed to entice Angola 's black masses into new government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unavailable to them . Though the program is showing results , it involves a slow , laborious and wary process . Usually the maneuver begins with a Portuguese army patrol finding a message in pidgin Portuguese tacked to a tree by some natives asking food or a bag of salt . The provisions are left as requested , plus a note offering safe-conduct to a resettlement village . In this way , some 250,000 Africans have so far been moved into such centers . <P> On the face of it , there is no apartheid in Angola . Under paternalistic Portuguese rule , the races have mixed so freely that Angola has a proportionately high mulatto population . Some natives with ability have been allowed to earn good money , and today in Luanda 's Continental Hotel it is common to see whites waiting on blacks . But the vast majority of Africans have been kept down by almost total lack of education and by labor laws which kept them in near bondage . These laws are now being overhauled .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
