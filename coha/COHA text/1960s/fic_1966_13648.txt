The action takes place in Musana 's sitting room - somewhat richly furnished : sofas , paintings , foreign mementos , radiogram etc . As the curtain rises , we see Kato fidgeting in one of the seats . He flips through one book after what seems to be an agonizing moment of decision making . He bolts up dramatically and proceeds to recite his favourite extract from King Lear : Edmund 's soliloquay  --  Act 1 . Scene ii . Enter Lydia , unnoticed . LYDIA What are you doing , Kato ? KATO I was trying to recite a Shakespearean soliloquy but then I found I 'd forgotten most of the words . LYDIA Reciting who ? Shake-shakean ... KATO Shakespearean soliloquy . ( Stressing every syllable . ) LYDIA Is that why you look so tense ? Come on , Kato , ( Shakes him sisterly , ) show more life in you , man . We have n't lost a relative , have we ? Come on , man ! KATO What is life when hope is gone ? Just now I feel rotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but strange thoughts keep haunting me . And visions ... visions of strangers tramping lonely roads silently ... these strangers , Lydia , always invite me to follow them . Just as I 'm about to catch up with them , they disappear into the belly of the earth . p. 3 LYDIA You must be sick , Kato . You must ask daddy to take you to see a doctor at the National Hospital . KATO No , Lydia , you do n't understand . LYDIA Or is it , Beatrice ? You 're not going after Beatrice , are you ? Pursuing her till kingdom come , is that the story ? But the way you do n't seem to talk much about her these days , it seems ... Have you broken off with her already ? At one time you thought she was the only girl in town . What happened ? KATO The little fool . As soon as she heard I 'd stopped schooling , she forgot all about me . It is now Kyomya she is in love with  --  Kyomya , the fat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You do n't say ! KATO All women are like that ; you love us for the wrong reasons . You know what she told me last vacation when we were alone , in her sister 's flat ? " Is it true that you do n't belong ? " she asked . Just out of the blue . LYDIA What did she mean belong ? KATO I could have bolted out of my skin . I mean , it was so unexpected . So calculated . Just as I was about to touch her tits . To put her off I said : " Belong ? How do you mean , belong ? Belong to you , to mother , to father and to whatever else you might bloody well care to mention ? Oh , damn it ! No one belongs , Beaty . No one belongs . We are all exiles even unto ourselves . No one belongs . Beaty , no one belongs . " She understood , I think , and replied : " Ah well , I suppose it does n't really matter , does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not your fault you 've been brought up to look at life through blinkers . p. 4 LYDIA You are wrong , Kato . KATO I 'm absolutely right . I know what I 'm talking about . LYDIA Look here , Kato , you may be over eighteen and all that , that does not make you an authority on life . Men make women , if you see what I mean , and vice versa . Our mother here , for example , is good and considerate ; she loves and cares for us a lot because father makes her so . Creates the conditions for her to do so . KATO Mother , good ? I would n't bet my love on that . How naive can you get , Lydia ? She is a hypocrite , that 's what she is . We have a bloody hypocrite for a mother , I can tell you that . And that 's not the whole truth either , little sister . And that 's not the whole truth either ! She is a bleating , stinking hypocrite who loves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and children . In fact you too , do like the mirror a lot , do n't you , Lydia ? LYDIA Poor mother ! I do n't know what she 's done to you to earn your wrath . If she knew what you think of her , we would go without a meal for a week ... KATO That 's right and she would be cooking special meals for you-know-who-I-mean all the while . How I hate that man ! LYDIA Kato , please ! KATO Now do n't go and tell her what I have told you - but I thought you might like to know . That 's all . p. 5 LYDIA What makes you so sure you know her that well ? KATO She is my mother , that 's why I bloody know her well , Lydia . I know mother , all right . I have watched her , followed her , thought about her and savoured her every deed  --  since I opened my eyes and was able to walk about , that is . Yes , I know mother : mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adultress . That 's who we have for a mother , if you 're not scared of staring facts in the face . She is tightly holding on to potsherds of her marriage ; loving yet afraid to tell us the truth . That 's our mother for you . Trying to hold a delicate balance between diametrical opposites . Yes , that 's our motherall right . LYDIA My God ! You do hate her so , do n't you ? KATO Hate ? I have no time for hate . It consumes too much energy . Forget it . ( An uneasy silence , during which she is making her hair profusely . Kato is looking at her with some calculated amusement . ) KATO How is the old man ? LYDIA Now do n't you dare raise your coarse tongue against father too . KATO ( Laughing at her misinterpretation ) : I mean the HM. p. 6 LYDIA I do n't want to talk about him . KATO You are crafty , Lydia  --  you take after mother , no doubt . ( Knowing laughter ) ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your own business , Kato . ( Threatens to silence him physically . ) KATO ( Backs off . ) All right , all right ... And the poor woman did n't know about it at all . She probably does n't up to now . LYDIA I said , mind your own business . KATO I have a mind to tell her if you do n't handle me carefully . Spill the beans and see what would happen . I 'm tired of these charades . I 'm dead ... LYDIA Tell her what ? KATO ( Persistently ) : I wonder what she might do , if she knew she was sharing HM with her own sixteen years old daughter . LYDIA I am going to my room , if you do n't stop this nonsense of yours . KATO You are sharp , sister . Very sharp . Inherited our mother 's instincts , no doubt about that . LYDIA ( Blowing up ) : Stop it , I said . It 's very well for you to talk about it but ... Besides , it 's none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thread . It was a masterpiece . Every day at four o'clock going for evening classes . To learn stitching . ( Amused laughter ) They taught you how to stitch up lies , sister . They 've done an admirable job . Poor mother ! ( Vicious all of a sudden ) : She deserves it , the whore . LYDIA Kato ! What a thing to say about your own mother ! KATO Unlike you , truth is my mission . I could say worse things . But for now , that will do about your adventures with ... LYDIA ( Blowing up on Kato , she lands a few feeble blows . Kato choking with laughter does n't take up the challenge ) : You bastard . You lazy idiot . KATO ( Taking the insults lightly ) : You 're not the first one to call me bastard . So I 'll let it pass . LYDIA I am sorry . It was n't meant to hurt . Anyway , just you forget it , dear brother , will you ? KATO All right . Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? " Shakeshakian " book . ( He picks up another book instead of Shakespeare . ) LYDIA Books , books and books ! What use are they to you now that you 've left school ? Or perhaps you want to show off before me , eh ? Big brother reading big books . p. 8 KATO Little knowledge is a very dangerous thing , Lydia , do you know that ? One does n't have to be in a classroom in order to do some reading . I 'll read these books until I prove to Mr. Steven Musana that despite his reluctance to pay my school fees , I can go on with my education somehow . Is that clear , young lady ? ( Lydia remains silent  --  busy plaiting her hair . Kato tries some reading . After a moment or so he falls back in a chair and laughs heartily . Lydia is startled . ) LYDIA Why are you laughing ? Have I done anything funny ? KATO For the first time I have read sense in these books written by imperialists who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( He reads aloud ) : " A child is a child only when it is born of legally married parents and is acceptable to both of them . When parties concerned disagree , then the child has no parents . Illegitimate children are as unwanted as a swarm of locusts in a harvesting season . Therefore , such children can not truly be said to have parents , because they are a product of accidental circumstances . " That 's right . If ever I get married , I shall not tolerate my wife messing about with other men and creating a whole tribe of fops . If this happens , both mother and child will have to quit . But ... but I wo n't be a cruel father to my true child . p. 9 LYDIA How then do you explain our ancestors ' marriage system ? I mean those who married many wives . KATO They were fools . For one thing , love can not be shared ; for another , they did n't love their children as much as they should have done . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children are born they do n't have to suffer because of jealousy from the other wives in the homestead . Do you get my meaning ? Can you bring yourself to understand what I mean ? LYDIA But surely when illegitimate children are born whose fault is it ? Is it their own fault or their parents ? KATO I suppose God is to blame ... for allowing unwanted lives to come into this world . The parents too , may share the blame  --  either the mother for being too loose or the father for being negligent . Anyway this is not your cup of tea , Lydia , dear , is it ? You 're too inhibited to understand the twisted ways of this wretched world we live in . I 'm quite definite these things are above your head , even though you 're having an illicit affair with , with ... I 'll tell you what is in your line of interest . LYDIA I 'm listening . What is my interest ? KATO Make-up , dressing your hair , clothes and music , of course . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LYDIA You dare not touch father 's radiogram . It 's brand-new and he 's still so much in love with it that he gets upset and threatens blue murder when anyone else touches it . He has specifically told us not to touch it , remember ? KATO They wo n't be back from the pictures till midnight and , besides , they may fail to get a taxi . Lydia dear , do n't you and I want to go to the pictures ? But why do they leave us here ? Why ? We 're not their servants . If we ca n't go to the pictures we can at least listen to some music . Lydia , we 've to amuse ourselves in the best way we can . LYDIA Kato , please , do n't invite trouble ; leave the gram alone . I do n't want to listen to any music . KATO Well , I do . ( As he moves towards the radiogram . ) LYDIA Please ! Please , Kato ... KATO You mean you are going to tell father that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are you , Lydia ? LYDIA Not that . It 's still new and I doubt whether you 've learnt how to operate it yet . You might break it . KATO Spoil it indeed ! If they can play it , why ca n't I ? For your information , my teachers always said I was going to become a first class engineer  --  I have got an excellent hand for machines . ( He plays Jim Reeve 's " This world is not my home " . Lydia gives up. ) p. 11 KATO This is exactly my kind of music  --  smooth and sentimental . LYDIA Ha-ha ! ( Laughs sarcastically . ) What a tune to go mad about ! Is there anything that interests you in such a moanful record ? Kato , do n't pretend to be a grown-up . KATO Look who is talking ! Grown-up , oh yeah ? ( Loaded with meaning ) : And what do I have to do to be a grown-up ? Date a Head Mistress or something ? LYDIA That was n't called for . KATO I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ) : Forgive me . Will you forgive me ? Shall we be friends again , please , please , please ! ( Reluctant to to forgive him at first . Then relents ) : Please , Lydia ! LYDIA It 's all right . I forgive you but I still do n't see why you should pretend to love Jim Reeves ... KATO There 's no question of pretence here . It 's the way Jim sings , the way he rolls his voice from his heart of hearts , that is remarkable and captivating . His very self seems to sing . Oh it 's a wonderful tune , this one . ( He is singing out the tune as he picks up Lydia to execute a dance step. ) p. 12 LYDIA I prefer Elvis . He 's light-hearted . Not as moanful as your Jim . It 's a pity you do n't seem to like him . KATO All right . Tell you what ! Just to please you , I 'll play your favourite " Fun in Acapuluco . " ( He goes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Acapuluco " as he happily whistles the new tune and monkeys around . Something in the radiogran snaps . ) Oh damn ! Damn ! Damn ! Trust this wretched hand of mine to put me in trouble when I least need it ! I 've broken the starter . LYDIA What ? ( Incredulously ) What have you done ? KATO Do n't tell me you told me . LYDIA I told you . I warned you ... KATO What shall I do ? He 'll kill me . He 'll send me packing ... Oh God ! Where shall I go ? Oh my ! I ... I ... ( He is tongue-tied . ) LYDIA I told you . I warned you , Kato . I knew you were bound to end up like this . What shall we do now ? What shall we tell father ? He 'll bury us alive , I 'm sure of that . O God ! KATO I must begin packing . Father must not find me here . No . I must go . But where shall I go ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the servant ... Say it 's you , Lydia ; father wo n't mind much . ( Knock at the door . ) My God , I 'm doomed forever . Please , please , Lydia do n't tell father . He 'll kill me . I know his temper . I ca n't stand it . I 'll go to my room . I 'm so shaken . He 's bound to find out even before he sees the damn thing . ( Earnestly begs Lydia ) Please , Lydia , do n't tell him it 's me who has broken ... Please , promise ... ( He runs out of words and dashes to his room - Lydia opens the door . Musana Father and Crissy Mother come in. ) p. 13 LYDIA You 're back rather early tonight . MUSANA You do n't seem to be well , my dear . Is anything the matter ? You 're not yourself . LYDIA Yes , dad . I ... I ... I 've a slight headache and some indigestion . I could n't sleep . We could n't find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you put it , Crissy ? CHRISTINE It 's finished , the tin is empty . MUSANA Oh dear . This house of mine ! LYDIA I 'll be all right dad . Did you like the picture ? MUSANA Your mum could n't stand the film . I do n't know why . CHRISTINE The man denied his own son and expelled him from his ... LYDIA Oh , father , please tell me more about it . MUSANA Forget about the wretched film . I did n't like it ... It made me feel ashamed of ... Where is Kato ? LYDIA ( Deliberately ignores the question ) : What about the side programme ? MUSANA Lousy . ( He moves towards the radiogram . She subtly stands in his way. ) p. 14 LYDIA Did they show you the trailer of the new James Bond film , dad ? I 'm told ... MUSANA No James Bond ,  --  thank heaven . LYDIA Why father , do n't you like James Bond ? Everybody likes JB . MUSANA What can I tell you , daughter ? You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right now is that your James Bond is too Kato-like for my comfort . By the way , where is he ? LYDIA Oh , he 's asleep . MUSANA So early ? LYDIA Do sit down , dad . Your drink will be coming . ( Realizing that her attempts are futile she feigns pain in the belly . She executes a seemingly genuine cry of pain . ) MUSANA ( Dashing to Lydia . ) Lydia , what 's the matter ? LYDIA Pain , sudden pain . In my belly . Pain all over me . Sharp as a knife . I think I 'm going to throw up . MUSANA Throw up ? Are you pregnant , Lydia , are you ? LYDIA No father , I 'm not pregnant . But I 'm dying , I 'm dying . Oh ! Oh , ... ( Musana fumbles around trying to help her in vain . He is not convinced about her reassurances . He wants to be dead certain . Suddenly he pauses . Looks at her intently. ) p. 15 MUSANA ( Sharply ) Lydia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What is this business about stomach aches and vomiting ? Are you pregnant ? LYDIA ( Feebly ) No , father . I 'm definite I 'm not pregnant . And father , how do you expect me to be pregnant at sixteen ? ( Another feigned cry of pain ) : The pain , the pain ... MUSANA And the pain in the belly ? What are you hiding from me , Lydia ? What 's the matter ? Answer me . LYDIA I am not pregnant , dad . MUSANA What then ? LYDIA ( Losing battle ) I do n't know . I 'll be all right , dad . I 'll be okay . ( He considers her for a moment and decides to go over to to play some soft music on the radio gram . He chooses a record as Lydia waits for her doomsday . ) MUSANA Hey , Lydia , what 's this ? What is this I 'm seeing here ? Has anybody been fiddling and fumbling with my radiogram ? The starter is broken ! Who did it ? LYDIA I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick . ( Exit Lydia. ) p. 16 MUSANA Crissy , Crissy ! Come , come here at once . ( Crissy emerges with a bottle of Uganda Waragi or any other suitable spirit and two glasses . ) CHRISTINE What 's wrong ? Why are you screaming your lungs out in the dead of the night ? What 's the matter ? MUSANA Look , who did this ? CHRISTINE Did what ? MUSANA Broke the starter of my radiogram ? ( Enter Kato and Lydia . ) CHRISTINE I do n't know . MUSANA You do n't know ? CHRISTINE How would I know about the damned thing ? I do n't play it . No one plays it . You do n't allow anybody to touch it , let alone play it . You probably spoilt it yourself last time you played it . You 'd put in quite a few pints if ... MUSANA I spoilt it myself , is that it ? ( Notices the children . Sarcastically ) : You excellent architects , who has made this remarkable achievement ? Tell me at once ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer from Lydia . ) LYDIA &amp; KATO We do n't know , dad . p. 17 MUSANA Do n't play about with me . If you do n't tell me who did it , I 'll lash each one of you till your bones begin rattling . Who did it , Lydia ? LYDIA I 've no idea , dad ; we 've not touched the machine at all . MUSANA I 'll make you have some idea . ( Addresses Lydia threateningly ) : Is this the meaning of your cries of pain in the belly ? Your imaginary deaths and puke-up ? Is it , Lydia ? You of all people , how could you have done this ? Made a fool of me ! Me , Musana , your father . Look at her . Eyes unblinking as a cobra 's . No shame , no respect , nothing . You ' ll be more straightforward with your father , if you know what 's good for you . ( He begins to look for his stick  --  mother tries to question them in whispers - father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once ... CHRISTINE What are you trying to do , Musana ? Be reasonable , man . Your beating Lydia or Kato wo n't repair that thing there ... MUSANA It will teach them how to be straightforward with their father . CHRISTINE But it wo n't repair it , will it ? So be reasonable ... MUSANA Reasonable ? Are you also in this ? Get out of my way , woman . I wo n't have my things spoilt like this . I take great pains to equip my house and you take minutes to undo everything . Almost daily some object is lost or broken or stolen . I wo n't have it . Lie down , Lydia , I said ! ( Lydia starts weeping  --  lies down  --  as the cane descends Kato owns up ... ) p. 18 KATO It 's I father . I did it . I broke the starter . It was an accident . MUSANA What ? KATO It was an accident . MUSANA Accident again ! Huum ... Kato , it seems you live in a cyclone of accidents : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's an accident . When you spoil my television , it 's an accident . When you spoil my radiogram , it 's an accident . Where shall we end with this string of accidents ? Shall we say that your life is another accident ? Is that it , Crissy ? CHRISTINE Darling ... have ... MUSANA Stop darling me unnecessarily . This 's no time for such frivolous adornments . Especially when you 're the fountain of all my worries  --  the worries of the entire ... CHRISTINE All your worries ? What ... MUSANA And your own worries too , and everybody 's worries . CHRISTINE You ca n't start talking about worries as if your son had committed murder . Anybody could have spoilt that cheap thing there . It can be repaired anytime . So I do n't see why you should boil yourself to fury like a steaming pot of beans and then start heaping insults on your own son , your only son . This is ridiculous . p. 19 MUSANA My son indeed ... My strange son . Do you think I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't have a hand as reckless as your son 's . ( To Kato ) : Get out of my sight . To your room . Quick . ( Less rudely to Lydia . ) And you , Lydia , go to bed . ( When they are both gone he spits out ) : Bastards . CHRISTINE Would it cost you anything to polish your tongue ? You ca n't bastard our children as if they were picked up from the streets . Supposing they should hear , what would they think of us ? Mark you , they 're grown-ups now . MUSANA Grown-ups now and at my expense . Your son might as well start smelling out his right father . It 's high time you showed him who his real father is . But if you start making feminine defences , you 'll endanger your own position here . Now , do you want me to make a public denunciation of your son ? Do you want me to put the matter in the local papers or on the radio or better still , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking ill about Kato . Why do n't you be man enough to talk about him when you 're sober ? Why am I not complaining about the child you got outside our marriage ? Or about the hundreds of shillings you spend on him whilst you 've refused to pay for Kato 's fees ? You think I do n't know ? You think it does n't hurt me ? Now I can see . That woman is bewitching you against your true son . She thinks he 'll be the heir . She wants her child to be the heir . So , please , forget about your silly talk . You must see things as they are , as you see them when you 're sober . p. 20 MUSANA ( He reaches out for a drink and helps himself ) : Silly talk , did you call it ? All right , when I 'm sober I 'll show you who is silly . CHRISTINE Do n't you have anything else to talk about ? How can you go on shouting and cursing in the dead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even lack self-respect ? You must remember who you are . You must learn to guard against the black spirits which occasionally cloud your mind . ( He appears unmoved by her speech . ) And by the way , tell me , am I welcome in this house ? If you think I 'm no longer your wife , tell me . I can go back to my parents anytime and I 'll be very welcome . Am I wanted here ? ( Pause  --  no answer . He takes a sip of his drink . ) I 'm talking to you , sir . Am I still wanted here ? Are my services needed ? If not , tell me . I 'll gladly leave and you wo n't see me here as long as I live . ( Pause  --  no answer . He moves about the room ) : So please think twice before you leap . If I did n't know you 're that drunk , I 'd pack up my things and go home this minute . But then I know what drinks turn you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drunk we 'll talk over these matters tomorrow when I 'm sober . But I 'm not so drunk as to forget two important points . You must ask your son to stop bringing his painted girlfriends here . I already have one too many parasites . Secondly , he must leave my daughter alone . I 'll decide who 's to marry her  --  not his fellow hooligans he keeps bringing here . Is it clear , you impervious woman ? p. 21 CHRISTINE You can tell him yourself , if that is bothering you . Since when have I become your mouthpiece ? MUSANA I said I have one too many parasites . CHRISTINE What 's the matter with you , Musana ? Please be sensible . Are you intending to turn this house into a monastery ? Are we to break all contacts with the public ? You 're ruining your own family . MUSANA My family is my family , Christine . You also get out . ( She hesitates . ) Get out , I said ! You want me to show you the door , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long sip . ) MUSANA Oh what a world of woe this is  --  full of cursed women and unfaithful wives . Christine here thinks I 'm a fool or a coward or that I 've gone mad . Whenever I say something about her son , she balloons her cheeks and threatens to divorce me . For these eighteen years she 's been doing it . Yet I ca n't get along without her . She is an important part of me now . ( Pause ) No , something must be done . Her bastard will either have to go or they must both leave . No compromise here . I 've educated her son long enough , clothed him , done everything for him , as if I was a fool . Yet the boy is so religioulsy insolent , the mother so pig-headed . When I 'm away at work my servants are allowed a few hours to go visiting , the children are sent to the shops . Then men come to pay me visits . A very honest wife she is . Yet Lydia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cool-eyed breed . She tells me everything . Damn the HM and all those who advised me to take her out of school . She 's now a wasted brain . ( Pause ) Truly human gratitude has a short memory . Christine and her son ought to be calling me their God . I think I 've been rather too soft with her . I 'd be better off now if I 'd followed my father 's advice . He always said , " The dog , the woman and the barkcloth tree , the more you beat them , the better they be . " ( Enter Crissy . She plants herself seductively halfway in the doorway and calls upon Musana suggestively. ) p. 22 CHRISTINE Stephen , are n't you coming to bed dear ? It 's late . MUSANA Yes , I am . CHRISTINE I 'm waiting for you . I want to sleep ( Exit ) . MUSANA Sleep or no sleep nothing will cool my anger this time . It 's high time that boy was packed off to his real father . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he must . ( He walks off the stage briskly but hen-peckedly. ) @x ( The same  --  late afternoon , the following day . Crissy is seated alone tidying herself up , putting everything in order as though she were expecting an important visitor . ) CHRISTINE ( To herself ) John must stop coming here so frequently . The children are already suspicious about him and Musana has become as jealous as a he-goat . ( Enter Lydia . ) LYDIA Mother , are you going out ? You look all dressed up . You look very pretty , mom . Are you going out ? Can I come with you ? CHRISTINE ( Pretending not to have heard . ) What 's the time , dear ? LYDIA It 's five o'clock . Are you going out ? CHRISTINE No , no child ! I must try to keep smart while I can . You would n't like to have a shabby woman for a mother , would you ? And besides , we 're always getting unexpected visitors in this house ... Are n't you late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about this time , do n't you ? I think they are doing their best to prepare the youth for the future . They 're doing their best , do n't you think ? ( No answer from Lydia . ) Lydia , are you all right ? p. 24 LYDIA I 'm not feeling well , mom . I think I 'd rather stay at home and do my knitting here . CHRISTINE ( To her . ) No , no , Lydia ! You must go . I would n't like to encourage you to be so lazy . Your father will blame me for it . You must not develop the habit of getting headaches whenever it suits you . You must learn to stand these little headaches of yours , do you understand ? LYDIA I 've said I 'm unwell , mother , so I sha n't go . Look , mother if you want me out of the way , if you would rather I went away from here for an hour or so , please , say so . I can always go visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not that , dear . If you 're not well ... LYDIA Why is father so late ? He did not come back for lunch ! Is he gone out of town or what is it ? CHRISTINE Well , I do n't know  --  perhaps he 's somewhere attending a political meeting or he 's gone to visit his ... eh ... you ca n't understand men , dear child . They 're a strange breed . They 've got various things which keep them away from their home and their wives . But , of course , each time they come back late , they tell you , " We 've been to political meetings , " and they look so serious , genuine and so tired that one almost believes them . On the other hand , a little freedom has its own advantages . p. 25 LYDIA It has , does n't it ? CHRISTINE You think so ? LYDIA I do , mom , I do . Has Kato gone to attend the Youth Wingers ' meeting , then ? CHRISTINE He must be somewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... ( Knock at the door . ) CHRISTINE Who might that be ? I 'm so fed up with unexpected visitors . Well , Lydia , before I forget , tell Kagwebe to go and buy us some drinks in town . And will you go check what film is on tonight , dear . LYDIA I 've said I 'm not well mother . CHRISTINE A little walk will do you a world of difference . I 'll ask dad to take us out as soon as he returns . Is that all right ? But if you 're not really feeling well , then it does n't matter , dear . Ah ! ( She sights ) These unexpected visitors are a nuisance . ( Exit Lydia , looking a bit suspicious . Crissy goes to open the door . ) CHRISTINE Oh ! It 's you , John . Please , come right in . JOHN ( Joking ) Oh ! I would love to come right in . ( Crissy smiles approvingly ) You look very charming today , my dear ( Tries to embrace her. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , John . I do n't like ... Look , Lydia is around . I would n't want her to get ideas in her head ... JOHN What ideas ? Ideas about what ? Do you suppose that daughter of yours is a virgin , Crissy ? At thirteen these children know more about love and life than we did at thirty  --  in our time . You surely know that , do n't you ? Do n't ever underestimate them ... CHRISTINE Still we must be careful . ( Jokingly ) Thanks for the information , and for warning me . I 'd never make the mistake of leaving the two of you alone together , in future . But John , why are you late ? I thought we agreed to meet at three . JOHN It 's work , my dear , work . I could n't leave my class and the headmaster gave me a little assigment to ... CHRISTINE I have a very serious problem to discuss with you , John . JOHN Serious problem ? You 're not expecting my child , are you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my love , would it ? It would be a blessing . An heir for me . Do you realise ? An heir ... CHRISTINE It 's not that , John , It 's me . JOHN You ? Are you sick or something ? Come on , do n't be shy . Incidentally , are n't you going to offer me a seat ? Can I sit down ? p. 27 CHRISTINE I 'm sorry , John . Do take a seat by all means . It 's just that I am all mixed up . JOHN What is it , Crissy ? CHRISTINE My husband . He has turned bitchy and unpredictable all of a sudden . And Lydia is behaving suspiciously . But it 's him I 'm more worried about . JOHN ( Jokingly ) : Let 's stick a knife in his throat , while he is sleeping . ( Knifing gesture ) : That will put an end to our problems . CHRISTINE Do n't be absurd , John . You are a teacher , not a murderer . JOHN Lovers are murderers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murderer . CHRISTINE Stop joking , John . He could do something nasty to you if he found you here . You 're the invader . In his own house . JOHN An invited invader , remember ? CHRISTINE Be serious , John . JOHN Who is joking ? A knife in his throat and we have peace and quiet . CHRISTINE I wo n't entertain that kind of thought even though I am not happy here . JOHN I know , I know . Who would be with Musana  --  such a touchy old pimp . In fact , I 'm surprised you 've managed to live together for eighteen years without cutting each other 's throats . You are a very patient woman , Crissy . A very lovely , patient woman . p. 28 CHRISTINE I ca n't bear him any longer . JOHN I understand . But then you know what I have always advised you to do , do n't you , darling ? There is a home patiently but anxiously awaiting you at my place . CHRISTINE Well , yes . But , but , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem . It 's me you are after , not that woman . I 'll send her home to the village to look after my coffee plantation . And we will stay here in town and enjoy ourselves to the full . CHRISTINE That 's what you would do to me , is n't it ? When you get fed up with me ? You 'd send me packing ... JOHN Never . Get fed up with you ? Why on earth would I do that ? I will never get fed up with you , Crissy . How can you even think of it ? How can you , Crissy ? CHRISTINE I am sorry . JOHN You should be . CHRISTINE What about the Father Superior ? Would n't he mind ? JOHN It 's none of his business . We ca n't all become Pope John Paul , can we ? We ca n't all hope to be saints either , can we ? Nor is he a saint that Musana man of yours , for that matter . ( Crissy is silent ) Is he Crissy ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh ! I see . CHRISTINE I have known him to fuss about such little matters . JOHN You have , have you ? Officially yes ; but privately , that 's another matter . That says a lot about your Father Superior , does n't it ? CHRISTINE Do n't be ridiculous . JOHN Crissy , what 's the matter ? You 're not as hospitable as you usually are . Are n't you going to give me a drink ? CHRISTINE I 'm afraid not . Musana might sail in any moment now . Besides , there are more important things than drinking tea , John . My husband should be here any moment now . ( Pauses while he lights his cigarette ) : Are you really serious , John ? JOHN What about ? CHRISTINE Do you want me and Musana to separate ? Go our separate ways . Do you really , really want that , John ? Do you want to make a home for me and ... ? JOHN I 'm dead serious , of course . Do you think I would come here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we known each other now , Crissy ? Six ? Seven years ? That 's quite some time , is n't it ? Crissy , darling , you know we are meant for each other . We are soul mates , no question about it . We 've shared our dreams and problems and challenges together , have n't we darling ? What would stop us from being happy ? You 're absent-minded , Crissy . What 's the problem ? Is anything troubling you ? p. 30 CHRISTINE How about my children ? JOHN How about your children ? They are old now , are n't they , darling ? They are old enough to look after themselves , are n't they ? They do n't need you to change their nappies , or do they ? They may land you with grand children sooner than later , but that 's another matter . So you see , they are not a problem , at all , at all , I think . CHRISTINE I do n't know , John ; I do n't know ! JOHN They could stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And come to see us occasionally . CHRISTINE I would have to come with the children , John , if you really loved me . I 'd have to come with the children . He would n't look after them properly . JOHN But he is their father , is n't he ? CHRISTINE I know . JOHN Then why would n't he look after them properly ? CHRISTINE It 's complicated . Besides , he is a stingy old fellow . JOHN That he is , I 'm sure of that , the bastard . CHRISTINE You do n't know how careless and tight-fisted , Musana can get . I would n't want my children to starve to death . He rations the food , rations the sugar ... p. 31 JOHN And rations his love , I know . He rations everything . I do n't know how you managed to stay with him all these years . CHRISTINE I would n't like to leave my children with such a man . They would literally starve to death . No , John the children go where I go or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But supposing he refused the children permission to come to live with us . He is their father , you know . He has the last word in matters such as these . CHRISTINE He would only be pleased to get rid of them . Kato , at any rate . He says the boy has grown insolent . JOHN We should think more about this . Let it not worry you . There is always a solution to ... CHRISTINE What would we do if your wife refused to go to the village ? JOHN Refuse to go ? What 're you talking about ? Refuse to go ? Are you out of your mind ? How on earth can she possibly refuse ? CHRISTINE You would n't drag her out of the house , would you ? It 's also her house you know . She has a right . JOHN What right ? What right are you talking about ? Leave that to me , my dear . I know how to handle my affairs like a man . p. 32 CHRISTINE I 'm happy , John . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . JOHN I 'm happy too . ( Embracing her , etc . ) CHRISTINE John , please , stop it . I do n't want my daughter to know these things . She is a very sensitive young girl . JOHN ( Mock seriousness ) I 'm not going to stand this any longer . Each time I want to touch you , you bring in your daughter . Do you think she is a virgin ? Does n't she have her own life to live ? I know a thing or two about your daughter that would shock you . CHRISTINE John ! What on earth are you talking about ? JOHN Never mind . CHRISTINE What do you mean , never mind. You make wild allegations about my daughter and then ... JOHN Yes , I know a thing or two ... so stop using her as an excuse . CHRISTINE You mean , you have also ... JOHN ( Laughing at her for jumping to conclusions ) Me ? No , Crissy . I would n't do that . I would n't date both mother and daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would ... who do , as a matter of fact . p. 33 CHRISTINE You 're a decent man , John . Truly you ... You mean Lydia has got a boy friend ? JOHN A boy friend ? No . Not a boy friend . But a man . A big man . A man of substance . Do n't joke with Lydia . She is running a man of substance before your own nose ... CHRISTINE You 're lying . That 's not true . It 's not possible . JOHN Suit yourself . But I know one or two ... CHRISTINE It 's impossible JOHN I have seen it with my own eyes , Crissy . CHRISTINE You could n't have . She never leaves this house . JOHN My own eyes , Crissy . With my own eyes , I have seen it . You do n't have to believe me ofcourse , but I have seen it with my own eyes . CHRISTINE You are cheap , John . You are very cheap . How can you tell lies against my daughter ? JOHN Now I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... CHRISTINE Cheap as a ... JOHN Stop pretending that she does n't know the sweeter side of the world . She knows it . Do n't waste your time pretending . CHRISTINE I could hate you for this , you know , John , I could . She is only sixteen . How could she ? p. 34 JOHN I told you . At thirteen these children know more about the world than we did at thirty . I said it , did n't I ? CHRISTINE You did . Did you come here to insult me ? JOHN Insult you ? No , my dear . I came here to put your heart at rest . Everyday at five o'clock , she goes to the Youth Club meetings , does n't she ? CHRISTINE Yes , she does . JOHN Do you understand now ? CHRISTINE You mean she does n't go there ? JOHN Precisely ! She does n't . CHRISTINE I do n't believe it . But I 've seen her handiwork . JOHN Bought from the handicraft shop by her man friend . CHRISTINE You make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out accidentally , as a matter of fact . CHRISTINE Who is the man ? JOHN Does it matter ? CHRISTINE To me , it does . Who is he ? I 'll kill him for defiling my daughter . JOHN You 're not a murderer , remember ? p. 35 CHRISTINE Who is he ? JOHN A man . A man of substance . A man whom society bows its head to . A man revered by sheikhs and bishops . A man you know very well . I 'm told . Our very own HM . CHRISTINE ( Absolute shock . ) What ? JOHN Our very own God-loving , God-fearing headmaster whose eyes are squarely set upon heaven 's gates by all accounts . CHRISTINE Oh no ! JOHN In the school storeroom , when pupils and other teachers have gone home . One evening , I found three hoes and a rake in the school garden . The children had forgotten them there . I picked them up , and being the store master and the master on duty at the time , I thought I might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I approached , I thought I heard some strange noises emanating from the store . I was curious . So tip-toe upon tip-toe I walked to the door . I opened the door as cautiously as possible and lo ! There , in a corner , chest to chest , on a heap of empty gunias was Lydia and the HM ... must have been a quick job for he had forgotten to bolt the door . Or probably routine job otherwise they would n't have been so negligent . CHRISTINE I 'll sue that old lecher for child molestation. p. 36 JOHN God ! The way he glared at me ... CHRISTINE I 'll tell the Father Superior about it . JOHN He could have killed me . CHRISTINE Spoiling other people 's daughters ... JOHN I said , " Sorry , Chief . " Shut the door and went home to mind my own business . CHRISTINE To mind your own business ? JOHN Momentarily , I had a mind to lock them up in that room , but then I thought otherwise . I decided to mind my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ? JOHN Did n't want to come between mother and daughter in that intricate triangle of love . That intricate web of deceit . CHRISTINE Intricate triangle of love indeed ! And where do you fit in in all this ? JOHN I do n't know . You tell me . CHRISTINE I 'll never forgive you , John , for not telling me . You know my daughter is being abused and you keep absolutely silent about it . I do n't believe I can trust you after this . I do n't believe I can ! Not give me as much as a hint ! JOHN How could I ? She threatened me ... p. 37 CHRISTINE Who threatened you ? Lydia has the courage to threaten an adult ? A respectable high school teacher ? She has the courage ... Is that what you 're telling me ? JOHN Do I smell a whiff of jealousy somewhere ? CHRISTINE Do n't be stupid . I 'm talking as a parent that 's all . JOHN Not as a jilted , jealous lover ? CHRISTINE Me jealous ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Slight pause ) How did Lydia threaten you ? JOHN Both of them , as a matter of fact . On separate occasions . CHRISTINE Go on . JOHN Lydia herself first , " If you tell mom , I 'll tell dad about you and mom , " she said coldly , matter-of-factly . CHRISTINE She had the audacity to say that ? JOHN " Do n't think I do n't know about you and mom , " she added . " All the sordid details including your persistent plans to elope with her . And leave us in limbo . " She knows a lot , that girl . I think she 's been spying on us . CHRISTINE I 'll kill that lecher . I 'll circumcise the dirty dog ... No wonder the school is all in a mess . No wonder it 's always upside down . Always at the bottom of the heap in exam results . Always going on ... p. 38 JOHN On strike ? CHRISTINE Precisely ! JOHN Then afterwards ... CHRISTINE What manners can he teach the children ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CHRISTINE What education can he impart ? JOHN I thought I was in for a sack . I haated the way he avoided looking at me straight in the eye . I thought he was going to give the sack . But ... CHRISTINE What discipline can he impose ? JOHN He asked me whether I had time to go out with him for a drink or two . CHRISTINE I 'll teach him a thing or two . You wait . A thing or two . JOHN And I said I was game . CHRISTINE The pig . JOHN He first threatened me with an immediate transfer . But I told him that what I had seen out there in the storeroom was none of my business . For all I cared , I said , it could even have been one of his own pupils , and I would n't utter a word about it to anyone . " Chief is always chief , " I said . " A chief should n't go hungry , " I added . p. 39 CHRISTINE Are you out of your mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John , how ? JOHN That pleased him immensely . You know what he called me when he got inebriated ? " Good boy ! " CHRISTINE What ? JOHN " The sky is the limit , young man . The sky is your limit ! " Can you imagine him patronozing me like I was his son or something ! " If you tame your tongue , the sky is your limit , I promise you that . And I 'm a man of my word . To prove it , I make you head of the school security committee henceforth because you 're a very observant boy . " ... " I 'm okay ! Chief , Really , I 'm okay . Truly , chief ! " ... " There is money in it , young man , do n't be naive ; there 's money in it . I 'd take it if I were you . By the look of things , you could do with a bit of cash to fund your amorous activities . " When he mentioned " amorous " I thought he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer without further arguments . " Thank you , Chief , I 'll take it . You 're ever so right . I need the money . " CHRISTINE You 're such a sucker ! I did n't know that side of you . JOHN He is my boss , remember ... CHRISTINE Still , it does n't give him the right to call you names . Nor should you allow yourself to be called names and then bribed off with a meaningless position . ( After some thought ) : Maybe you 're a boy after all . p. 40 JOHN What ? CHRISTINE If you knew all along that your HM was abusing my own daughter and you said nothing to me about it , because you 're scared of losing your job ... JOHN I did n't want to be transferred from here . I could n't stand being away from you . CHRISTINE Or scared of being transferred to a bush school , then I see you in a different light ... ( Pause ) He will suffer for what he has done . First , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Father Superior must know this . Did he tell you anything else ? ... John , did he tell ... JOHN Who ? The HM you mean ? Well , when he got drunk , he lost his guard and became increasingly more amicable . He told me every sordid detail . CHRISTINE ( Anxiously ) : What did he tell you ? JOHN About you and him , Crissy . He said he had loved you very much and that without any rhyme or reason , you had decided to dump him . CHRISTINE He 's liar . I 've never loved him . JOHN ( Reassuringly ) : It does n't matter to me , Crissy . He told me everything . He told me he had prayed you and implored you not to leave him but you 'd stuck to your guns . p. 41 CHRISTINE The lecherous liar ! JOHN To take revenge , he said , he had started working on Lydia - your daughter . At first , Lydia was very reluctant and all that , he said . But as time went on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much , he said . Do you think your having taken her out of school may have developed a rebellious streak in her psyche ? She may have given in to his advances as a way of punishing you ? CHRISTINE Maybe . I do n't know . How long have they been going together ? JOHN A year , he said . Three or four times a week . CHRISTINE Supposing he should make her pregnant ? Supposing he should make my daughter ... JOHN That 's what I asked him . CHRISTINE Yes ? JOHN He said he knew how to take care of that . CHRISTINE Does he want to make my daughter his second or third or whatever wife ? JOHN Contraceptives . He told me something else . Lydia has known about you and me for quite some time now . CHRISTINE My goodness ! And about you and me ? JOHN Of course . p. 42 CHRISTINE What a mess . JOHN So , my dear Crissy , stop imagining your daughter does n't know the grisly side of the world , she does . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So far . CHRISTINE A what ? An abortion ? Are you out of your mind ? This is the limit . JOHN She told you she was going to visit her uncle or something , did n't she at some point ? That 's when it happened . The HM took her to a friend of his who called in a doctor , and it was done . Since then , she has taken to the pill . She is contemplating using the threemonths injection . CHRISTINE I ca n't believe my ears . All along I thought Lydia was ... No . No . No ! The Father Superior must know about this . JOHN The Father Superior indeed ! Do you think he is that innocent ? The Father Superior ! You do n't you read the newspapers ? CHRISTINE No one is an angel from what you say ... But I have to tell somebody . I ca n't keep silent about this kind of abuse . JOHN I would n't do such a thing , if I were you . Think of the consequences . Think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land us in a big mess . What I 'll do though , I 'll talk to some important friend of mine and see what he advises . He is a boss in the Department of Education . We have become buddies , of late ... he 'll see what he can do , okay ? And now , my dear , let me go . It was not my intention to spoil your mood , but you know the truth has a way of popping out unexpectedly ... Besides , I would n't like your husband to find me here . In the meantime , do think about my little proposition . Give it a serious thought . p. 43 CHRISTINE Do you want me to tell Musana that I 'm leaving ? ( No answer ) John , you 're absent-minded . Do you want me to tell ... ( To herself ) : What is he up to I wonder ! ... John ... JOHN Not yet . Not yet , Crissy . Let 's give it a week or so . ( He moves to the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? CHRISTINE ( Non-committally ) I 'll let you know soon . Pretty soon . John , I think we should go slow for now . The situation is becoming rather complicated , do n't you think ? JOHN Complicated ! I see ! But then , Crissy , the situation has always been complicated ( Adds tantalisingly ) do n't you think ? That 's why it 's so exciting , do n't you think ? Stolen grapes are the sweetest . ( Exits ) CHRISTINE Yes ... there goes a man despite his other wife . ( Pauses ) Do I love him really , really ? I do n't know and I do n't want to know . Period . ( She calls ) : Lydia , Lydia , come here a moment , my dear . ( Enter Lydia . ) Did you go to the Odeon Cinema to check what movies are showing ? p. 44 LYDIA I 'll go just now , mother . CHRISTINE Is your headache gone now that the visitor has left ? ... ( She is making it up ) : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? LYDIA Mother , I swear I was n't . Why should I have ? CHRISTINE Indeed , why should you have when you know enough already ? Is that what you 're telling me ? LYDIA I do n't know what you are talking about , mom . CHRISTINE I want to open my heart to you , Lydia , and please be frank with me , will you ? LYDIA I 'm always frank , mom . Is there anything wrong , mother ? CHRISTINE Yes . There 's a lot of talk about you . LYDIA A lot of talk about me ? There 's a lot of talk about you , mom . Not about me , if you want to be frank . CHRISTINE Your father does n't like men ... LYDIA I know , mom , I know . It galls him . CHRISTINE He does n't like them coming here to see you . LYDIA ( Shoots up in utter disbelief ) : To see me ? p. 45 CHRISTINE ( Not particularly bothered by her reaction ) : He says your brother invites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my dear . You 're not of age to fashion out your own delights as yet , you know . Supposing there was an accident , whom would people blame ? LYDIA What are you talking about , mother ? What accident ? This is news to me . I do n't understand . The men who come here are usually after father or Kato . Unless you 're suggesting that the one who 's just been here came to see me . ( Decides to confront the mother ) : Did he come to see me mother ? CHRISTINE ( Evasively ) No , no , no . He was looking for your father . LYDIA Was he , really ? Well then , why do you say I 'm toying with men ? Mother , do n't you trust me ? Do n't you think I 'm old enough to look after myself ? CHRISTINE That I do n't know . But at your age I dreaded men . LYDIA I do , mother . I never give them a chance to get near me . I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CHRISTINE That 's the spirit , daughter , keep it up . You wo n't regret it . LYDIA But , mom , I suspect there 's some grave secret between you and father  --  some secret you do n't want us to know . ( A door is heard opening ) Who is that ? ( Thinking it is her dad who opened the door ) : Dad . is that you ? p. 46 CHRISTINE It must be him , I think . ( Kato enters . ) LYDIA Kato , what 's the matter ? You look sad , my dear . KATO Yes , I 've had a very rough day . I 'm terribly confused . I want to stay here , but then I mus n't . I want to go , but I do n't know where to go . I want to do something drastic , but I do n't have the guts . Oh , I wish I 'd never been born . I 'll kill myself , Lydia . I 'll kill myself , mother . Why should I be tortured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the matter ? How can you be thinking about suicide ? Has anybody mistreated you where you 've been ? Has anything upset you so much that you should think of suicide ? Is anything troubling you son ? LYDIA I begin to fear . There 's something wrong in our home ! Ooh , God ! This is terrible . KATO ( In a very slow , sad voice ) : Lydia dear , can I talk to mother alone ? ( She hesitates looking at the mother questioningly . Crissy nods . Lydia goes to her room . ) CHRISTINE ( Crissy approaches Kato and asks him gently ) : What is it , darling ? Tell me . Is anything the matter ? p. 47 KATO Mother , promise me that you 'll answer what I 'm going to ask you , and please answer it honestly , mother . CHRISTINE I 'll do anything to make you happy , son . I 'll answer your question as sincerely as I can . KATO Who , who 's , who is my ... father ? CHRISTINE Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ topic has come out in the open . ) KATO Yes , mom , who is he ? CHRISTINE Why ? You 've never asked me as ridiculous a question as this ? What do you mean , who 's your father ? KATO I want to be assured , mother . I mean his name , his clan , his job , his wherebouts . Who 's he ? CHRISTINE Your father is your father  --  your mother 's husband , if you like . Is that all that 's worrying you ? KATO ( He takes a very deep breath ) : Who is my mother 's husband ? CHRISTINE My heavens ! Do you think I have a thousand and one husbands ? Come , you must be unwell , Kato . You must be terribly unwell to come up with that kind of nonsense . I 'll take you to your room . Come . You need a rest . p. 48 KATO I 'm not suggesting you 've a thousand husbands , mother , but ... they call ... people call me bastard . What do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me bastard ? CHRISTINE It 's a cliche ; it 's a meaningless word which your father has taken fancy to . He bastards anything , and anybody . His tongue speaks more than he intends it to mean . I can assure you of that . Has he ever called you bastard when he is sober ? KATO No . CHRISTINE It 's always when he 's put in a pint or two in his head that his tongue becomes very irresponsible ! KATO No , mother , you ca n't go on cheating me like this . I do n't deserve to be treated the way you do . I 've evidence to show I do n't belong here . And you know I do n't belong here . So nothing but the truth will satisfy me . I want to know from you who my real father is . I do n't care a pin whether he 's a beggar or a leper or anything , provided he 's my real father , provided he takes and respects me as his true son . CHRISTINE Have you gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't go on being a scape-goat of your past adventures . I wo n't be victimised any longer . Everywhere I go , I hear bastard . Leaves whisper bastard . Birds sing bastard . Frogs croak bastard  --  everything bastards me . Why should everything torture me like this ? I 've had enough . Something has got to be done . Why are you keeping the truth from me ? Tell me truly who my father is and to him I 'll go . p. 49 CHRISTINE You jibberinng idiot , you want to create a father according to what you think or according to the gossip you hear from drunken village peasants ? Stephen Musana here , my husband , is your father and that 's final . KATO But he does n't treat me like his son . He treats his servants better than me and more kindly . He only hurls insults at me and blames me for everything that goes wrong in the house . He curses me at the slightest excuse ! You know he does n't like me here . He wants me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to be candid for once . You must tell me who my real father is ... if you do n't , you 'll regret ... ( Knock on the door . ) CHRISTINE That 's father , I 'm sure . Stop this jabbering of yours ... KATO ( Sarcastically ) Father indeed ! I 'll give way to my honourable father . ( Exit Kato as Musana enters . ) CHRISTINE Hullo , darling . MUSANA Huummph . ( He just growls grumpily and passes by her  --  does n't return the greeting . ) CHRISTINE Had a good meeting ? MUSANA Yes , with my thoughts . Now tell me , my dear Crissy , do I smell of alcohol ? p. 50 CHRISTINE I did n't say you did , did I ? ( Senses danger approaching . Continues tactfully . ) How was your day ? MUSANA Well then , we must try to find out who actually is silly , who actually is ... CHRISTINE Please , Musana , let 's not quarrel . Ca n't we have a bit of peace and quiet for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Can we do nothing but snap at each other like mongrels ? ( Pleads with him earnestly ) : Please ... MUSANA There 'll be no peace and quiet in this homestead unless our differences are resolved ; unless lies cease to be our guiding principles . Your son , my dear , Christine , must go . If you ca n't tell him who his father is , I 'll do it . CHRISTINE You ca n't start making nasty jokes after all this time . Do you realise what the consequences of what you are proposing to do will be ? MUSANA I 'm not proposing to do anything , I 'm only telling you what I 'm going to do . What I must do . CHRISTINE Why have you decided to do it now ? Whatever it is you want to do . Why now ? MUSANA That 's none of your business , all right ? Besides , you ca n't blame a tortoise for moving ever too slowly to his destination . The important point is that he eventually gets there and in one piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it before now ? Have you just realised that Kato is not your son , after these eighteen years with me ? Do you know what your decision will mean to you and me and the children ? I imagine our neighbours will call you a brave man for taking this kind of decision ! MUSANA The neighbours you 're talking of already know all your goings on . They have always known . CHRISTINE Think of the consequences , Musana . MUSANA I do n't care a jot what the consequences will be . Our neighbours can say anything they like or do anything for that matter . They 've always said things each time my back was turned anyway . But one thing they will not do now , they 'll not run my house for me . Enough is enough . All I want right now is to see that boy out . In so doing I 'm saving him a lot of embarrassment , and I 'm saving you the shame . Not that you care because if you did you would n't do the things you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eighteen years ago . You 've brought shame on the family , Crissy . You 've brought shame on your children . But if you refuse to do as I tell you , I 'll wash all our dirty linen in public . CHRISTINE Musana , darling , you know what you are suggesting is impossible . You know how sensitive our people are . You 're ruining Kato 's future . Society will deliberately make him feel out of place . He has already smelled something odd in the air ; he 's now talking of suicide . Have mercy on the young man , Musana , have mercy on me ... p. 52 MUSANA He is eighteen years now , is n't he ? He 's old enough to father a child and fend for himself . He is a man now , a man Crissy . I waited patiently till he turned eighteen . I thought that that was the most decent thing to do , to wait till he was of age ; but apparently you do n't see it that way . CHRISTINE Musana , darling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you to beg . It does n't become you . You 're not good at begging . And in any case , the decision is already made . Your son is not the only bastard in this country . There 're lots like him . Even in our own village , I 'm sure you know of children having three different men claiming them . So your son is not alone in the ring . CHRISTINE Darling , for our love 's sake have some consideration . Since he 's left school , I 'll persuade him to find a job far away from here . You do n't have to send him away now . The world will be rough on him . Have mercy ... MUSANA It 's for our love 's sake that the boy must go ; but you do n't see it that way . It seems there 's something else you 're scared of . What is it , Crissy ? What are you hiding from me this time ? ( Silence ) Crissy , tell me frankly , are you ashamed of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seduce you must be very charming . He must have special attributes that attracted you to him . Or have you already forgotten him ? Tell me. p. 53 CHRISTINE I 'm sorry , but , but the man is dead ! MUSANA Haaha ! He 's dead and you 'd have me continue being a pseudo-father . Must your son have a father ? Ca n't he do without one ? You cheated me in our marriage , death cheated your son by taking away his true father ! CHRISTINE You ca n't be so callous and cruel , darling . The man is dead and gone . Need you be jealous of someone dead ? Please be sympathetic . MUSANA I 'm being very sympathetic , as a matter of fact . You do n't even appreciate that . And who is this man , if I may ask ? He may be dead , but the whole family is not dead . Kato can go to his relatives ... He must ... ( Enter Lydia in an excitable mood . ) LYDIA Mother , mother Kato is ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get back . We 'll call you . Leave us alone for now ... LYDIA Father , please listen to me , Kato is tearing up all his ... MUSANA Shut up , Lydia , will you ? Out of my sight . ( Lydia goes out disappointed , dejected and confused . ) Yes , as I was saying , Crissy , Kato has to go , he must go . Right away , as a matter of fact . I 'll be cheating my conscience if he stays here . I 'll never feel happy with him around . I 'll never be happy with anybody . I 'll be hating him too , for I wo n't love him . I ca n't love him . We were not meant to love each other as father and son . So he 's got to go . ( Enter Lydia and Kato who is in ragged clothes . Parents are unaware of them. ) p. 54 CHRISTINE But go where ? KATO To my father . Here 's my passport  --  your will and testament , sir . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't tell me where to find him . Tell me , sir , who is my father ? MUSANA Ask your mother . KATO Mother , will you be kind enough to tell me who my father is ? Who is he ? CHRISTINE Musana knows best . LYDIA What is all this about ? Kato , are you blind ? KATO In some ways , you 're yet too young to understand this , Lydia . But do n't you worry , Lydia , you 'll always be my dear , dear sister . No matter what . ( Addresses Musana ) : And you , sir , be a man , and tell me . I must know where I 'm to go . MUSANA As I 've told you before , I 'll tell you again . It 's a question only your mother is qualified to answer . Ask her ; she knows best who your father is and where he is . KATO Mother , please ? CHRISTINE ( Summons up courage ) : He 's James Okot . KATO Who ? CHRISTINE James Okot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 55 KATO Yes and where 's he ? Thanks , cruel mother . Tell me , where he is and to him I 'll go . CHRISTINE ( To herself ) : Oh God , what shall I say ? ( She moves to Kato and holds him ) : Last year he met an accident and ... and died , died on the spot . ( He brushes her aside ; she starts weeping . Musana is looking on unimpressed ) KATO Died on the spot ! Died on the spot ! Oh God , why do n't I die on the spot ? Shall I follow my father into his grave ? Oh bitter truth ! To know my father then not to see him ! What have I done to deserve all this ? MUSANA That is life , my dear friend . Take it easy , we 're all to meet the same end . KATO To take it easy and to meet the same end ! That 's man 's role . That 's my inheritance . I 'll take it easy . These feeble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grief , must carry me through my scourge . They must serve me . I must serve them till I meet the same end . Oh sun ! Oh night ! Oh cold ! Do n't be too hard on me . We are all bastards in a bloody bastard world . ( He stumbles off stage ; then turns before he exits ) Goodbye , good mother . I go into the world . I go to meet my father . And you , sir , thanks . Thank you very much . ( He moves further , then stops ) Lydia dear , goodbye and good luck . Remember : no matter what .. ! ( Without any further ado , he exits. ) p. 56 LYDIA Where is he going . It 's dark . What a cursed family ! ( Weeps afresh ) . Kato , Kato , dear , come back ! Father , call him back . Oh brother , brother ....
