DEAR SIRS : On Sept. 17 , the Board of Governors of State Colleges and Universities of Illinois will very likely reconsider the case of Staughton Lynd  --  a case , we believe , that raises issues of national importance In July , the board rejected the appointment of Lynd as associate professor of history by Chicago State College , even though the appointment was unanimously recommended by the department of history and the president of the college The board . did " not question Dr. Lynd 's ability as a scholar and as a teacher of history " Instead it held that his " public activities " ? his advocacy of " nonviolent civil disobedience " and his trip to Hanoi in 1965-66 ? " go beyond mere dissent " So far this case has attracted very little attention outside Illinois , but we are confident that many readers will agree with us that the board 's action represents a particularly flagrant invasion of academic freedom As such , it concerns everyone who values the right of dissent We hope that readers of this letter , singly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Springfield , Ill. , urging upon them the principle that a man 's political views can not be permitted to override the professional judgment of his peers , Professors at a dozen private and public universities have formed a Committee for Academic Freedom in Illinois . which is attempting to publicize the case and to support Professor Lynd 's lawsuit against the board . Individuals who would like to sign the committee 's statement of principles and contribute to a fund for legal defense are urged to communicate with one of the co-chairmen of the committee who have signed this letter Chi istopher Lasch , Northwestern thrive , 5111 ' Evanston , Ill Alfred F Young , Northern Illinois University DeKalb , Ill. restoring the consensus Durham , Conn DEAR SIRS . I disagree with the assessment of many editors and writers that President Johnson is caught in a difficult dilemma , the conflict between a continuing gradual escalation in Vietnam or genuine efforts at negotiating a peace , each alternative guaranteeing further displeasure from large segments of the ' 68 electorate Not a statesman , Johnson is very definitely a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run in ' 68 and he will win His victory will be assured by the deliberate involvement of this country in a war with China In the summer of ' 68 we will be " provoked " into a defensive assault upon China If that happens , and if history is any teacher , the people will not turn the incumbent President out in the heat of so perilous a venture That is the morality I see in this President and this Administration , and that is the future I see for this country unless by some miracle the Congress ( or someone , or something ) turns Johnson 's head in the next fourteen months .

DEAR SIRS If our " over-kill " in thermonuclear weapons restrains the second largest possessor of such destructive forces , why the necessity to traverse the globe with our military forces ' ) It would be sufficient if the President di-rected our UN Ambassador to notify world delegates that in the event any country practiced aggression against us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reserved for Soviet Russia .. George M For EDITORIALS Morton the Realist Sen. Thruston Morton 's switch from the prowar to the anti-war side may well prove to be the key event in the 1968 election . A former GOP national chairman , Morton is respected by politicians of both parties for expertise and integrity . He added to his authority by the manner in which he changed his position . He simply said , " I was mistaken . " This is the most effective way of avoiding fruitless discussion and the need for apologetics designed to prove that one can be right on both sides of a controversy It also attracts attention by reason of its novelty . Other Senators could well make use of it . In an interview with John H Averill of the Los Angeles Times , Mr. Morton discussed the public reaction to his switch He mentioned the overriding reason for making it , which is that he felt it to be in the national interest to end the Vietnamese War as soon as possible and therefore , as a matter of conscience , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same time , he felt that he was voicing a view that a great body of citizens was beginning to adopt in their individual thinking , One reason for this swing in public sentiment is the duration of the war and the lack of any prospect of ending it by military means . At the same time President Johnson 's mistakes , and his efforts to cover up , are becoming more evident every day . It has become imperative for responsible politicians of both parties to part company with him Mr. Morton 's timing was good . His speech of September 27 did not come out of the blue In our issue of August 29 we noted editorially that he had changed his mind and had said so in an interview that was little noted at the time . The underlying politics of the Presidential succession in 1968 furnishes ample reason for Morton 's determination to drive the Republican Party toward a peace platform . The GOP is today a third party , as George Gallup pointed out in summarizing his latest poll . Out of every 100 adults , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 27 as Republicans If the Democrats can not win as Democrats , much less can the Republicans win as Republicans . Experienced men like Morton , Cooper and Case see this clearly  --  and they know what is going on in the minds of that 31 per cent in the middle . Every day they are getting more sick of the war . Another phase of the GOP campaign tends in the same direction . Nixon is pursuing Goldwater 's 1964 tactic and his own tactic of 1960 in trying to corral delegates , a technique at which he has no equal But this may not work in 1968 because of the large number of favorite-son delegations which did not exist in 1964 , and -- a point of cardinal importance  --  because the polls are superseding the primaries . Their temper is that a moderate Republican who is a critic of Johnson 's war policy has an excellent chance of the nomination  --  and of being elected . Whether the dump-Johnson movement will succeed is doubtful , but it does not have to succeed ?        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
