KHRUSHCHEV by Mark Frankland 213 pages . Stein &; Day . $6.95 . <P> <P> In future histories , Nikita Sergeevich Khrushchev may be dismissed as a mere transitional figure . But in Russia 's painful move from a malevolent monolith to a more responsible member of world society , he was essential . His Cold War contemporaries described him variously as a Red Hitler and a Jolly St. Nik , a shoe banger and a shrewd geo-politician . Before his ouster in 1964 by less colorful but more pragmatic men , Khrushchev had justified at least some of those descriptions : he denounced Stalin and initiated the cultural thaw in Soviet life ; he built the Berlin Wall and wisely backed down from the Cuban missile crisis after rashly getting into it ; most important , he allowed the Soviet economy to become consumer oriented , a process that has begun to alter the very nature of Marxism . <P> This book by the London Observer 's former Moscow correspondent fails to bring Khrushchev alive , but it raises questions about all the unknowns in his life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sadistic Stalinist during the old days as a commissar of the Moscow subway ; did his war experiences turn him away from Stalin ; did he become a " goulash Communist " only after the showdown in Cuba ; why did he permit Brezhnev and Kosygin to ease him out ? This book fails to answer those questions , but only Nikita can do the job-and he is unlikely to write his memoirs . <P> <P> ASSASSINS by Nicholas Mosley . 252 pages . Coward-McCann. $4.95 . <P> <P> Q. Why is it that modern novels have to be different , that they ca n't just be stories of characters and action and society ? <P> A. We know too much about characters and action and society . We can now write about people knowing . <P> This is a typically enigmatic bit of dialogue from Nicholas Mosley 's recent thriller Accident , and it seems to apply even more to his new one , Assassins , which is half mystery , half " people knowing . " During a top-level international conference , the motherless 14-year-old daughter of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her fate is in the hands of three of her elders : the chief government security officer , her father and his secretary , who is also his mistress . The latter is a disturbing woman- passive , manipulative , all things to the weaknesses of all men-seemingly a sister of the wife in Harold Pinter 's The Homecoming . It is no accident that Pinter adapted Mosley 's earlier novel for the movies . For both writers , ambiguity is truth itself . And for Mosley 's characters , a mere problem of survival is too simple . The reader who follows the course of Assassins to its appropriately absurd end will be rewarded by a sophisticated plot , a cartographer 's awareness of English landscape and a wealth of similes that are nearly as good as Mary McCarthy 's . But characters , action , society ? Hardly . <P> <P> ALONG THE CLIPPER WAY by Francis Chichester . 256 pages . Coward-McCann. $5.95 . <P>
