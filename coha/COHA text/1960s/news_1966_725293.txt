txt Secretary of State Dean Rusk and his foreign aid administrator acknowledged today that some United States aid to South Vietnam had been pocketed by corrupt officials of both governments . With the foreign aid administrator , David E. Bell , the Secretary went before the House Foreign Affairs Committee to support President Johnson 's $415-million supplemental foreign aid appropriation request . The request includes $275-million for increased economic assistance this year to South Vietnam . They met a barrage of questions about the extent of black market operations in Saigon and how much United States aid had been " stolen " by corrupt officials and diverted to personal bank accounts in Hong Kong and Switzerland . " You are absolutely right ? there is some diversion of funds , " Mr. Bell told Representative Wayne L. Hays , Democrat of Ohio , who led the ques // tioning . " We are trying to track ' it down and stop it . But not ! every rathole has been plugged . " 1 " We are trying to track down , and prevent it as best we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putting on additional personnel . But it ' is a fast-moving operation , this , movement of goods and money I into Vietnam . We will make it I as airtight as we possibly can. ; But there is a black market and ' the Vietcong is playing it to ! the hilt . " Mr. Hays asked Secretary Rusk if he was aware that , while dependents of military personnel had been returned to , the United States . a consortium ! of American businessmen still ! had their families with them in . Saigon . Before the Secretary could finish his affirmative reply , the Ohioan added : " And were you aware that the wife of one of them sent ' home money orders totaling $36,000 in six months from black market operations ? " Neither witness had heard of of this . Mr. Hays then said , " The U. S. Embassy in Saigon knew about it and a member of its staff told me about it . " Viewed as ' Serious Matter ' Mr. Rusk replied , " That 's a very serious matter ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I was also told , " Mr. Hays persisted , " that most of the aid , sent out there had been stolen ' either by Americans or the Vietnamese  --  most by the Vietnamese . " As for the families of American business representatives working for the Government in ' Saigon , the Representative told Mr. Rusk , " Maybe we ought to just tell them to get out . " " I have great sympathy for ! what you have said , " Mr. Rusk : A major complicating factor ! in the Vietnamese war . effort , Mr. Hays said , is the fact that " Saigon closes down and takes a siesta every day from 12 to 2:30 . " " Is there any way to prod these people into wanting to do something for themselves ? " he asked . Mr. Rusk replied in general terms on United States objectives in Vietnam . Neither Secretary Rusk nor Mr. Bell would venture any estimate of how much United States economic assistance had been diverted to the personal bank accounts of South Vietnamese officials and American personnel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are sold to merchants for piastres , the Soutn Vietnamese unit of currency , by the South Vietnamese Government . Mr. Bell said that this flow in commodities was currently " quite well policed by our people " to make sure they went where they were supposed to go . Penicillin Is Diverted But he said this was not always the case . He recalled the case of a large quantity of penicillin sent to Saigon through the commodity import program , for which the United States pays with foreign aid dollars here . He said the penicillin had been discovered hidden inside long loaves of , French bread . Mr , Bell ' said the penicillin was being diverted to an area outside the capital where it was not supposed to go . Whether those responsible were apprehended and punished was not disclosed . ! It was to pay for an expanded commodity import program , to combat inflation in South Vietnam , that most of the $275-million in additional economic aid this year was requested in the President 's sup- ' plemental appropriation request. , Representative Clement J. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Preimier , Nguyen Cao Ky , as say- ! Ing that , unlike some of his , predecessors , he did not intend to leave Vietnam " up to his armpits in gold . " Mr. Rusk was saying that ' the South Vietnamese had no ' monopoly on corruption when Zablocki remarked , " The Vietcong are not depositing any gold in Switzerland . " " I would n't be too sure of what , " the Secretary said . " They collect about $30-million a year in taxes and I would n't be surprised if there were some bank accounts . " Asked by a committee memben " just how much dishonesty is there in the Vietnam aid program , " Mr. Bell answered : " There is as little as we can make it , but I would n't want Ito give the impression that it is not serious . " A sympathetic committee member , who noticed the Secretary 's harried appearance on the witness stand , expressed ' some amazement at Mr. Rusk 's 1ability to keep up with the fast pace of world events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each situation bearing on United Slates interests . " How do you do it ? " Mr. Rusk was asked . The Secretary acknowledged that is was quite a chore to keep abreast of about 1,000 in coming cables and as many outgoing communications a day . He said that he spent the first half-hour every day going over a summary of overnight reports and of longer conferences with staff officials . With a sigh , Mr. Rusk summed up the troubles and pressures with which a Secretary of State has to live with this statement : " The world is round . Only one-third of the people of the world are asleep at any given moment . The other two-thirds are awake and probably stirring up mischief somewhere . "
