Someone once asked Solon how justice could be achieved in Athens . " It can be achieved , " replied the great law maker , in substance , " if those people who are not directly affected by a wrong are just as indignant about it as those who are personally hurt . " This generalized passion for justice has always been a hard standard to live up to , but U.S. Chief Justice Earl Warren cited it last week to set the theme for a major international meeting of jurists that convened last week in Solon 's city . <P> Formal title : " First World Conference on World Peace Through Law . " Ceremonially welcomed by the King and Queen of Greece in the marble halls of the Athens Hilton were 1,000 jurists from 105 nations . The conference was the culmination of a movement launched five years ago by World-Lawman Charles Sylvanus Rhyne , past president of the American Bar Association , and followed a series of preparatory sessions in Costa Rica , Japan , Nigeria and Italy . Said Rhyne in his keynote address @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diversity-a belief that in the rule of law lies the route to world peace . " World law , Rhyne cautioned , should not be thought of as " a dramatic panacea or cure-all for the world 's ills , but rather a patient labor demanding immense and constant effort to develop the true basis for civilized progress and existence . " Suggested Improvements . Henry R. Luce , editor in chief of TIME Inc. , recalled the Biblical passage , " Blessed are the peacemakers " and pointed out : " Note that the word is peacemakers-peace has to be made . Peace can not merely be kept-not for long-by force of arms . Neither will peace be given to us as an undeserved gift from heaven . <P> Overwhelmingly , peace is the work of justice , and the work of justice is mainly the work of the law . " Luce urged his listeners to carry the case for world law " to all politicians and to all the governments of the world . " Said he : " So far as I know , no President or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top of his political banner , " but the " rule of law can become good politics . " In six days of deliberations , the jurists modestly began " the work of the law " by surveying the world 's existing legal framework and making suggestions for improvement . Main conclusions : <P> THE UNITED NATIONS . Really to be " mankind 's best hope for a peaceful world , " it needs more muscle . U.N . peace-keeping efforts should be codified , a permanent " peace police force " created , and the Security Council enlarged . <P> The conference recommended partial abolition of the veto : henceforth it should not be permitted when a dispute can be settled peacefully . But there was plainly no desire to get involved in the touchy issue of U.N . financing . <P> THE WORLD COURT . With most states ( the U.S. included ) reserving the right to ignore its jurisdiction , it has rendered only 13 final verdicts in its 18 years . More nations should bow to it , suggested the Athens meeting . The court should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and the possibility of " regional world courts " should be explored . <P>
