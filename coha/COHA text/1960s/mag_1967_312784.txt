For every Supreme Court action aimed at guaranteeing the rights of the accused , there is a reaction that the court is hindering the police . Last week the court issued a ruling that helped instead of hindered law enforcement . <P> At issue was the secret informer , whose tips often supply police with their sole " probable cause " for arrest . As long as police have such cause for arrest , they can search a suspect for the evidence that may convict him . But two Chicago policemen were sharply challenged in court in 1964 after they arrested one George McCray on a Chicago street corner , searched him and found heroin . At a pretrial hearing , the cops testified that they had been tipped off by a reliable informer , whom they refused to identify . McCray 's lawyers demanded the informer 's name ; if he did not exist , there was no " probable cause " and the heroin evidence could be barred . The judge ruled against disclosure , and McCray eventually got a two-year sentence . <P> By a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week upheld the conviction . When police claim that they have used a reliable informer , said Justice Potter Stewart , the Fourth Amendment does not require state judges to " assume the arresting officers are committing perjury . " Justice William O. Douglas spoke for the dissenters , arguing that if the police need not identify informers , they become the " arbiters of probable cause . " But the majority pointed out that a defendant is entitled to an informer 's identity at the later trial if he needs it in order to rebut the charges . Besides , the anonymity of informers is too important to surrender . " The informer , " ruled the court , " is a vital part of society 's defensive arsenal . "
