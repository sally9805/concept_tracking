a story by Thomas Parker TROOP WITHDRAWAL  --  THE INITIAL STEP T he position that Specialist 4 Wetzel had assumed in a morning formation in Southeast Asia was not one covered in Army Regulation 122-156 , " Dismounted Drill , " Section 2 , " Inspections and Formations . " It was , in fact , a position not covered in any Army Regulation and was therefore unauthorized , an infraction of the military rules for body member placement . Wetzel 's legs were not shoulder-width apart " at ease , " nor were they together from crotch to heel at " attention , " with the toes canted outwards forming an angle of not more than forty-five degrees . Only a single leg of Wetzel 's touched the ground at all , while the other was elevated flamingo-like behind him , And each time inspecting officer First Lieutenant Ernest Bauer clicked his heels in a smart left face in front of one of the men standing at " attention " in Wetzel 's platoon , Wetzel clapped his hands in a short burst of praise . Men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corners of their eyes , some with disdain , others with amusement , all , however , wondering what 1st Lt Bauer 's reaction would be to Wetzel 's nonmilitary behavior , to such an undisguised flouting of an officer 's authority by an enlisted man . Wetzel himself wondered how Bauer would react . Along with the clapping and his lack of " attention , " would Bauer also ignore the tarnished brass belt buckle , the boots that had taken on the color of the hundreds of things that Wetzel had kicked , tripped over , and stepped into since the last inspection ; would Bauer , for his own sake , for his own protection , pass Wetzel by without a word ? It was a fair possibility . Wetzel had calculated that , despite Bauer 's learning disabilities , by this , the third week of Bauer 's conditioning , he would have caught on . The officer clicked his heels in front of Wetzel , looked him over , and , with a queasy smile , clicked his heels again and went on to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Pavlovian experiment with Bauer was finally succeeding . Lately , Bauer had been struck down by an epidemic of shots . Following some reprimand to S Wetzel , who was in charge of Company Personnel , his official shot record would be lost and he would once again have to undergo the full battery of inoculations specified in AR 134-161 , " Health in the Sub-Tropics . " In the last month alone , Bauer had had sufficient immunization to guarantee the enduring good health of a sperm whale . Wetzel 's antagonism toward Bauer was not an immature one . It had been nurtured over the past year , growing through infancy , childhood , and adolescence , and finally reaching adulthood as their fifth month together in Vietnam was about to end . It was an antagonism which germinated from Wetzel 's experiences with Bauer at Fort Polk , Louisiana , where the two of them had gone through Basic Combat Training together , forced by circumstance to be " buddies , " communally eating sand and dirt , drinking rain , sleeping on rocks , and following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where , if they got there fast enough , they could take a five-minute-long " ten-minute break , " to sit in the snow and smoke and fart to keep each other warm . About three weeks into Basic , Wetzel realized with impassive understanding that he and Bauer were star-crossed . There , in an olive-drab mural of arms and legs , he among 250 men would run a hundred yards into the hand-to-hand combat sand pit , where , by the rules , the arbitrary man standing to his left would be his opponent for the lesson . Wetzel would turn and , without a single prayed-for exception , there would be Bauer glaring at him , frothing from the run , eager to try out a new twist of the **25;2004;TOOLONG . When Wetzel was the " aggressor , " he took it very easy , dummying the kidney punches , letting the " enemy " fall gently to the ground , and then applying a minimum amount of pressure to the throat and larynx . But then Bauer was the aggressor , smashing his fist into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit the sand like a sack of ballast , and applying sufficient pressure to the throat and larynx so that Wetzel 's eyes would bug , his lips would begin to turn purple and the color would disappear from beneath his fingernails . Also , in bayonet drill , prefaced by a card shuffle of 250 men counting off , calling out numbers , where men whose numbers equaled twice plus six the square root of each other became partners , it was always Bauer 's number that would fit Wetzel 's equation . Wetzel. when he performed as aggressor in the **48;2031;TOOLONG , thrust short , parried half-heartedly , and the horizontal swing of his weapon was a good two feet away from Bauer 's head . Bauer , true to form , as aggressor , made incisions into Wetzel 's web-belt , parried so zealously that Wetzel 's weapon dropped from his hands to the ground , and performed a horizontalbutt-stroke with such gusto that the sand embedded in the heel of Bauer 's stock would scratch Wetzel 's nose . But the greatest single contribution to Wetzel 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructor  --  a man whose name started with " F " and ended with " o , " whose name no living man could pronounce , but whose name was shortened and simplified out of desperation by the men in his platoon to Sergeant Frito  --  who matched Bauer and Wetzel as bunkmates and buddies . It was a match that forced complete responsibility for the other man , a match which entailed making bunks together and making sure your buddy was dressed in time and wearing the right gear . It was a perverse marriage between men who never shared anything sacred in their nine weeks together other than air , water , and cigarettes and the fact that neither of them had been circumcised . It became increasingly evident to Wetzel as Basic painfully dragged on , that Bauer had something going with Frito . Whenever anything had to be done for your buddy , Wetzel seemed to be doing it : cleaning Bauer 's weapon , taking notes for classes Bauer missed , making Bauer'sbunk , polishing Bauer 's brass . Bauer cleaned his own weapon only once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company as a demonstration . It was , " said Sgt Frito , " the cleanest weapon in five platoons . " During range fire for record , Bauer was in sick bay , but nevertheless led the company qualifying as " expert . " While it was unlikely that squinty-eyed Sgt Frito could even see as far as 350 meters , much less hit a target the size of a large man perched at that distance , it was nevertheless true , unless there was something that Frito had going with the cardboard silhouette as well . So it seemed to Wetzel that truly , Bauer 's trophy for soldier of the training cycle , Bauer 's medal for M-16 firing , and Bauer 's commission had been a mistake , the result of logical fallacy like so much else he knew existed in the Army . While death may have been a great leveler , leveling all men to zero , the Army leveled live men to an IQ of 85 . Halfway through Basic , Wetzel resigned himself to sailing forever in Bauer 's torpid wake , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as no surprise to Wetzel then , when he was finally sent to Vietnam after two months of typing school at Fort Tara , Virginia , where , when he entered the course he could type seventy-plus words per minute and , upon leaving , was cut to a more moderate thirty-minus words per minute  --  under the theory that typing so fast demoralizes the other men  --  that he and Bauer were to be in the same company . For his efforts with Sgt Frito and whoever else 's palm he greased in OCS , Private Bauer became 2nd Lt Bauer , and then miraculously , 1st Lt Bauer , stationed with a hospital company of almost a thousand men . On the outside , Bauer had driven truck for a large fruit concern and had recently made the transition from fresh to quick-frozen produce . It was a status job , a bigger truck , ten feet longer , a foot wider , and the latest in cabin design . When he stopped at caf  --  s with the new truck , he took little or no shit from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was all in good fun , although Bauer once had his nose broken by a stainless-steel cream pitcher being used as brass knuckles by a guy with a small laundry truck who did n't seem to give a damn what anyone was driving . This code violation was a mystery to Bauer , who , without ever considering what it meant , thought that fair was only fair . Because of his specialized background , Bauer was made Ground Transportation Officer in the company , a job that involved trucks and similar vehicles . Since the hospital was a permanent Army hospital near Saigon , the only real ground transportation that Bauer was called on to regulate was an eight-times daily bus to the city and an occasional ambulance to pick up American survivors who were injured in terrorist attacks . Usually however , the attacks were thorough and there were no survivors . At that point , the Vietnamese police would deliver to the hospital any bodies that seemed American . It was a " handsacross-the-sea " program that Bauer himself had instituted . There were only problems when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American or when they were not quite dead . Bauer , put a thirty-mile-an-hour governor on the ambulance so that it would take just about a half-hour to make it into the city , and by that time , things would have , in his own words , " wurked out one way or another . " All in all , Bauer did n't mind the war much . It was a way of passing the day . Enlisted men assigned under him kissed-ass and he responded by giving freely of absurdly long passes , which Wetzel , in Personnel , would find reasons to tear up and then send the men back to Bauer for others . In this way they would miss at least one bus , although sometimes Bauer would run an unscheduled charter for his men alone , which Wetzel , in Personnel , would find out about and feel obligated to mention to Colonel Schooner , who , in turn , would be duty-bound to mention it back to Lt Bauer . It was then that Bauer would mete out what he considered just punishment and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weekends on CP and consecutive nights as Charge of Quarters . The fabled shit rolled downhill from rank to rank until it hit Wetzel , who , in Personnel , having no one under him , did what he could for vengeance and protection , destroying Bauer 's official shot record , and then , as a dutiful S , notifying the proper medical authorities . On the other hand , Wetzel did mind the war . Before he was drafted he had been working as an accountant in a branch bank in San Francisco , where , other than an occasional holdup which would cut into his two-hour lunch break , he led a quiet , safe , and unobtrusive life , In Vietnam , what quietness there came to him was inner , his unobtrusiveness was the result of his rank , and safety was a thing of the past . And then there was the problem of the sounds , He had very poor filtering devices and the constant going off of claymore mines , rockets , and other forms of ammo would get on his nerves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building where he went over officers ' and enlisted men 's records , he would stutter and show other visceral signs of psychic disorder , In his room in Saigon atop a small barbershop , S Wetzel lay on his bed listening to the rockets and claymore mines go off . It was a drag , he realized , more than a drag , a colossal mistake for him to be here . He would have to leave at the Thomas Parker worked his way through Stanford University and continued studying writing at San Francisco State , where he received an M.A. soonest time possible . Why , he wondered , did n't he leave right now ? The answer he came to , he had arrived at before and before that ; he lay too close to the half-inspired middle of mankind . He was neither smart enough or stupid enough to desert ; and also , he did n't have the guts . On his bureau in olive-drab cans marked with black letters which read , " 10 Weight US Army Oil , " " 20 Weight US Army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and " 10X30 Weight US Army Multipurpose OiI , " Wetzel kept his different blends of grass . The fact that he turned-on did not necessarily distinguish him from the thousands of other enlisted men in Vietnam that did also . For Wetzel though , the grass provided neither a good stoning nor an orgiastic trip . It was merely a component in his survival kit , used to abstract , to make things disappear , things which ordinarily imposed themselves on his being with the bluntness of telephone poles . It worked : it kept him from harm and did n't seem to be doing him any harm . It was anyway only the officers , medical and otherwise , who feared the stuff and they would drink themselves into a puking stupor every day , sometimes so far gone by noon that they would disappear into their posh quarters , leaving the enlisted men in the hospital to perform reasonably delicate operations and to zip up the plastic bags which contained the newly dead patients . Wetzel could only guess how many of them were n't really dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't show the life-signs that the enlisted men were taught to look for : a certain level of heartbeat , breathing , pulse , the ability to cloud mirrors , etc . Zip ! Off to the States , dog tags hanging from the zipper tabs on the outside , the name inked-in on the chest of the returnee . An early-out Wetzel realized one day in the zipping room  --  a thought . W etzel , along with every other man in the entire United States Army , was allotted by Army Regulation 14-198 , " The Billeting of Troops , " Section 1 , Paragraph 2 , a minimum of 300 cubic feet of living space , which , when broken down , yielded approximately 6 feet by 6 feet by 8 feet . He did , in fact , have at least that much living space in the five-hundred-man barracks , but other than make his bunk there the first day he got to Vietnam , the 300 cubic feet went almost completely unused . Like all the other enlisted men in the company who had space allotted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't live there . Only when it rained , when it was impossible for him to maneuver his motor scooter through the shell-pocked streets from the hospital compound to Saigon , would he have to spend a night ; and then it would be a night completely alone , for Wetzel was the only man not to qualify for Bauer 's emergency transportation to the city . The last bus would leave Wetzel in the barracks among millions of cubic feet of space . 83 Appropriations for the maintenance and upkeep of the barracks , Wetzel found out one day reading Colonel Schooner 's memo to First Army Command , was over $800,000 a year . This included the substantial maintenance and upkeep of Captain Ellsworth , Officer-in-charge  --  daily changing of sheets , Vietnamese maid service , and what seemed to Wetzel an inordinate amount ( 3 miles ) of mosquito netting . Once a. month a barracks inspection with all five hundred men present would be held and Colonel Schooner , nearly blind in both eyes but much in need of a year 's active service for retirement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ included all the field-grade officers in the company along with a certain first sergeant named Horzkok . " Horzkok , " the colonel would ask , " are these men getting their sheets changed ? " " Yes , sir , " Horzkok would reply , writing something clown on a clipboard whose top sheet had n't changed since Wetzel had been in the company . " Horzkok , are the maids coming in daily ? " " Yes , sir . " " What about the netting ? Do you need more netting ? " " Probably more netting , sir . " The colonel grinned and winked at Horzkok . And so the retinue would eventually make their way past Wetzel 's bunk , grown men , some of them making more than a thousand dollars a month , inspecting a barracks that no one lived in , checking to make sure that all the special niceties in these barracks for the hospital personnel , who lived twenty miles away in hovels and brothels , were being carried out . In the beginning of his Vietnam stay , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he performed while working in Company Personnel . There he could create his own order ; there , all his antagonists existed only in paper files , on green and yellow cards , and on sheets of paper stapled to forms that , Wetzel realized one afternoon , in a company of a thousand men , only he understood . In realizing this , he realized also in a clouded way , that whatever power he as a S had , lay in this sole understanding of the forms . In these first few months , Wetzel did little with his recognition until one night in his Saigon room of ter some moderate smoking , the idea came to him in a raw but almost crystalline form . As Wetzel looked up to study the contours of his thatched ceiling , Bauer appeared out of the smoke of Wetzel 's burnt-down joint , the genie of Wetzel 's high . But this ethereal Bauer was not the singular Bauer of the past ; rather , Bauer took on the face and dimension of all the men in Wetzel 's basic platoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known . Here was Bauer with his Army sense of fairness and morality , his self-righteousness ; of a certain breed of man , Bauer became their everyman . As the smoke dispersed and the ceiling came back into focus , Wetzel remembered the forms . Why not , he wondered ? Why not , if Bauer is indeed what I see him as , why not de-form him , re-form him , change his being , make him into a more agreeable human . Or why not change his duty station ? But then Wetzel realized that by making small changes on Bauer 's forms he would be just playing with him . It would be no different than destroying his shot record . It was in this second , as Wetzel recogniztd the pettiness of merely toying with Bauer 's file , that the missing card meshed with the computer tabs in Wetzel 's brain and lodged itself resolutely there , leaving nothing else to be considered . Why not plainly murder Bauer , eliminate him entirely , take him out of the war ? After all , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form , to wound Bauer in action and have him captured , to make him a hero , a coward , to ship an unidentified body with Baner 's name on the chest along with a copy of Bauer 's dog tags , which Wetzel could cut with the machine in his office , back to the States . All the Army would need would be the correct forms and the body would be buried in some military cemetery and his insurance policy paid . What it came to with the imposition of the reality of the next morning was that Bauer was far more than just Bauer , and to eliminate him would be the initial step . It would be ample , sufficient , for Wetzel to know that while Bauer was harassing him in some formation , that the Army was concurrently paying off $10,000 to Bauer 's beneficiary and inactivating his file in St. Louis  --  where it is said ( and probably lied ) that every man 's record exists in duplicate . If every day Wetzel were n't witness to the same idiocies of men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brains behind the men who had given up their own  --  if every day he did n't feel that the Army , with him included , was digging deeper and deeper into the soggy Asian soil , if a hundred other things he had witnessed , noted , and forgotten had n't happened , the idea would have never entered his head . But lately , as he sensed things getting worse around him , he turned-on with greater frequency and was beginning to stutter . Somewhere also , Wetzel knew , if he kept after it , he would run down the regulation that would simply provide for his own release , the one that would send him legally back to the States . There , if things were not truly better , at least there was a semblance of order and peace and the Bauers were back on their trucks and not directly , at least , foisting their guerrilla tactics , their self-respected killer instincts , on those That had no desire for or interest in them . Wetzel did n't have it in for teamsters or even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concern these people . The morning following Bauer 's nocturnal visit , his tragic story began to take form . Wetzel never felt as justified , as sure , in anything else he had ever begun . Using the regulation method , he changed Bauer 's record to show that the Ground Transportation Officer had orders releaSing him from the hospital company and transferring him to a small infantry unit a few hundred miles north of Saigon , where daily confrontations with the enemy produced a high rate of casualties . Now it was simply a matter of how and when it would happen . Would Bauer be a hero or a coward when he died ? It was a decision that Wetzel could make without any more real concern than flipping a coin . He decided to wait before he actually killed Bauer off . Let him get used to his new surroundings , he thought . Let him get the feel of his new duty station before he died defending or running away from it . Wetzel cut a set of the phony orders on the office mimeo machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner concerned , but not in any position to care or to do anything about them . One thing was definite : everyone believed printed orders , and orders anyhow , were orders . Among the recipients would be the United States Army Records Center in St. Louis , Missouri . The hospital mail clerk hoisted the bag with the bogus orders from the office floor . It seemed to Wetzel that the first budging of the huge boulder that he himself had been called on to push was , that second , taking place . Now it was merely a matter of momentum . As in any large organization , minor errors would become major errors , would become glaring errors , would become more than errors , lofting themselves into the fields of absurdity until finally , a frantic hush-hush would become their epitaph . Wetzel felt as he watched the mail clerk leave Personnel and make his way to Captain Ells-worth 's bunker to pick up the never-existent barracks mail , that his decision to end Bauer 's involvement in Vietnam , even in an advisory capacity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he himself had deserted , gone on extensive AWOL , or lied his way into the hospital with phony meningitis symptoms . It was to be something finally done ; in his life , something he embarked on that soon would be completed , something he could actually be proud of , Bauer 's paper-death . Through his mind flashed an image of Bauer doing a **32;2081;TOOLONG . " You 're a grand old flag , Bauer , but you 're a big boy now . " Wetzel did wonder , weeks before and even now , who was he , Wetzel , to be deciding the number and frequency of Bauer 's inoculations and now his death . His own was not a history of unblemished service in the progress of mankind . Had n't he frittered away a quarter of a century in self-indulgent sloth and leisure ? In ways , did n't he share Bauer 's guilt ; was there really that much difference between negative action and inaction , Wetzel wondered . For an accountant , he had done very little accounting in his lifetime , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sounds of mines and rockets . But Wetzel also realized the afternoon the orders were sent , his past counted for nothing . One felt experience , one significant understanding in a lifetime , sometime , and you 're on your way ; and all that could be said about it was , if it happened , it happened . And now Wetzel felt that he was nearing the point of its happening . I f it was Bauer who had provided the emotion for Wetzel 's homicide plan , it was the zipping room that contributed reason . Whenever anyone was zipped , Wetzel had to bring down the ex-man 's 201 personal file to the zipping room and check his dog tags with his file for spelling , blood type , religion , and serial number . If any one of these things was off , Wetzel would have to cut a new set , then bang them up a little for authenticity and hang them on the special hooks at the top of the zipper . Accounts checked this way : St. Louis was happy , Colonel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when things ran smoothly in the zipping room , Wetzel was unhappy about the entire situation ; more than unhappy . Each trip to the room took him further and further away from believing that he actually saw what he saw . The eerie , overlit room with its plastic cleanliness and its antiseptic pink and black bodies made imperfect by bullet holes and missing chunks , became unreal to him ; part of a white light-show that he was forced to participate in and then leave , spent and drawn , as if he had danced there too long . When Bauer was in the room , as he often was , overseeing a delivery , Wetzel 's anxieties became directed and plain to him : clearly Bauer was in some way responsible . The door to Personnel opened . Bauer stood in the doorway for a second , attempting , what seemed to Wetzel. a certain effect , and then walked in . Wetzel stood up , mentally discovered , his thoughts detonated and scattered . Immediately as he was faced with the man , Wetzel was sorry that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plotting his demise . It was impossible in the intimate situation of two men standing right next to each other without weapons , for Wetzel not to bridge the span between men , and , for an instant , make himself that other man . But his feeling changed the second he saw the glint in Bauer 's eye . This was not the glint that would save Bauer from death . Had he come with sorrow , with reverence , with a question or a runny nose , with anything other than the look of a man thinking that what he was doing was unquestionably justified , Bauer might have been saved , Wetzel might still have relented and had him transferred back to the hospital company . " What 's this dickin ' around in formation , Wetzel ? I want to know about that . I let it go today . You know why ? " Sore . Wetzel knew why . It was the shots . Bauer was actually tired of the shots , the side effects , the vaccinations that must have pocked his arms like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but simple brain and had finally made the connection between the shots and Wetzel . " Well , Wetzel , I 'll tell you why . Your attitude here is the shits . It demoralizes , it pisses-off the men , They look at you and figure , ' Why not , if Wetzel can do it , why not me ? ' And when there 's a war going on , there is n't any room for that sort of crap . So today I decided I would n't draw attention to you by yelling in front of a whole platoon , but believe me , you better change your whole way of life around here . I 'm telling you that personally , here and now , so that you know I 'm not just jerking you around as an example . It 's you and you alone I 'm going to get , unless you change that high-and-mighty garbage of yours . Believe me , Wetzel , I 'll have you out of this cozy office , working your ass off permanently for me , if you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wetzel ? Understand ? " The man would have to die , Wetzel then decided with all his heart . Bauer had just turned Wetzel 's half-formed , fairly definite whim into an irrevocable mission . He had to see Bauer 's file sent away , he had to see the look on Bauer 's face on payday when he did n't get his cash to buy his prophylactics , beer , and ugly trinkets . Revenge asserted itself back into Wetzel 's plan . He now knew , that in order to stay in Personnel in the weeks pending the final processes of Bauer 's demise , that he would have to be careful , that he would have to stay away from Bauer 's shot record altogether . it was unfortunate , but a necessity . It was something in Bauer 's tone that indicated this to him , something that tipped him off to the fact that Bauer would literally kill him if there was a way of making it seem in the line of duty . " Wetzel , I asked you a question . When an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you understand that , Wetzel ? " It was then , at that very instant , the second that Wetzel was to come out with his servile apology to keep him safe in his job in Personnel , as Wetzel understood the meanness of means and the glory of ends , that the hospital compound was hit soundly , initially and accidentally by a squadron of American planes launched from the carrier Wendell Wilikie to fly cover for some Marines about to walk into the range of at least a half-dozen machine guns guarding VC mortar implacements , a few miles from the non-city side of the hospital . The plan to paint the roofs of the various buildings that made up the compound white with huge red crosses like the other hospitals in Southeast Asia ; had failed when 1st Sgt Horzkok had ordered the wrong color paint from Supply . Colonel Schooner , in an attempt to cover up for Horzkok 's error , pointed out at a high-level staff meeting that the crosses were not necessary . The hospital had excellent natural camouflage ; having been built by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a masterpiece of integrated structure and terrain . It was impossible , the colonel assured his men , to spot the sprawling bunkers from the air or even fromany distance on land . Colonel Schooner had called it right , but unfortunately the perfect camouflage was not working in his favor . The entire out-patient clinic was destroyed with the first impact . With the second went the enlisted men 's barracks . The building made a decent little puff and then , after a few seconds of limbo , burned itself to the ground ; just minutes before , all the sheets had been changed . The zipping area was hit and the building in which Wetzel and Bauer stood facing each other with hate , then with questioning , and finally  --  and Wetzel noted it distinctly in Batter 's face  --  with fear , collapsed around them . Filing cabinets vomited out drawers full of papers and then the cabinets themselves fell . The wooden roof collapsed , raining down thin slats and shingling , and finally , the sides , no longer feeling any responsibility for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the tangle of typewriters , paper , and Army Regulation pamphlets , Bauer and Wetzel lay pinned beneath a bookshelf , bodies crossed . Wetzel had hit the ground first , covering his head , having attended that particular class in Basic , and Bauer followed , not having attended the class but having been told about it later by buddy Wetzel . " Get the hell off of me , Bauer . " Bauer did n't respond . Wetzel heard further impacts off in the distance . Possibly by now Radio Operator Keyes , whose knowledge of international code was limited to a few words and catch phrases , would have awakened and shut a quick message to the United States Navy or the United States something to ask for a bombing halt . " Come on , Bauer , get the hell off ; " Still no answer , but then Wetzel heard a moan . Bauer was alive ! Big deal . Of course Bauer was alive . All that had actually landed on him were some AR pamphlets and a bookshelf which had fallen on Wetzel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and the regulations outside the building . Wetzel managed to crawl out from under the Ground Transportation Officer . Off in the distance he could see a fire in one of the wards , backlighting crafty Marines as they snuck up on the unsuspecting VC . There were bursts of machine-gun fire , lots of lights from flares , tracers , and flames and huge explosions from someone 's heavy artillery . The war arena had invaded the sanctity of the hospital compound . Bauer pulled himself up next to Wetzel , looking out to the left and the right as he did . " Jesus ! Come on , Wetzel . We got to do something . We ca n't just stand here . Follow me to that fire ! " Wetzel ran behind the man . As he ran , all he felt was the movement of his legs and his face heating from the blaze he neared . Bauer spotted some men in beds behind the flames and ran through to them . Wetzel did n't have time to decide , running through a few steps behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he would have never done it . In the pulsating orange light , he saw Bauer pick up a man from one of the beds and run out of the building with him . Wetzel looked around , picked someone up himself , felt the weight on his shoulders , ran with it , was outside , and dumped it off . He started back in after another , but this time he stopped for a second and thought . He hesitated at the edge of the flames . In the meanwhile Bauer had torn through and dumped another body . " See what you can do for these men , Wetzel . I 'm going back for another . " It was the perfect reason not even to think about going back in , realized Wetzel . Bauer had given an order and now the idiot was running back in himself . Wetzel looked down at the men on the ground in front of him ; all three of them were dead . The one Bauer was running in to get would probably be dead also . But Bauer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being a hero . Wetzel wondered , how many rights did Bauer have to do to make up for his wrongs ? What went on in that plodding mind that could transform Bauer from what he ordinarily was to the man who just ran back into a burning building to save what he thought was someone 's life . As Wetzel looked again at the men on the ground and heard the machine-gun fire of the Marines or the VC , he realized that it was Bauer 's wrongs that , by contrast , would put him in a position to make his rights seem great . If Bauer really thought about the humanity he was lugging out of the fire , he would n't be here in the first place : not in this hospital , in this fire , in this war or this Army . It hit Wetzel that way , but he knew it was n't that simple , although he wished it was . The fire went on for most of the day and into the night before it was finally put out by equipment that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where it was always vitally needed . The equipment was not returned the next day or the day following . Wetzel knew it would go the way of all equipment that had been borrowed by the hospital . During an inspection , Colonel Schooner would spot it , declare it obsolete , and insist it be dismantled for parts . Personnel was rebuilt in a day . It took three days for Wetzel to straighten out all the records . In that time he re-resolved that Bauer would have to die , but it became increasingly clear , as Wetzel relived the moments of Bauer 's running into the burning ward , that to have him die a coward would be a lie . It was an option that circumstance had stolen from him . It bothered him to have to admit this . What death , then , would he himself have to die ? What sort of man was he , Wetzel , who would choose cowardice over almost anything else dangerous or painful ? He thought and all that came to him was that the heroes must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  what did that make them : stupid , insensitive , unappreciative , or great , vital , keyed even more to life because they were that much more closer to death ? Whatever , the world needed these men ; Wetzel decided that he was not one of them . Most people , though , were or wanted to be heroes . A fter Bauer 's file had been located and carefully arranged , Wetzel made his way to the zipping room , carrying with him the file along with a newly minted copy of Bauer 's dog tags . A large hole in the room 's ceiling , still not repaired from the attack , admitted the sun and rinsed everything in the room in natural light , Boxes of the zippered plastic bags sat on one side of the room on shelves labeled " small , " " medium , " and " large . " One entire wall of the spacious chamber held the deep drawers that contained the bodies that had been recently zipped . Because the bodies would never spend more than a day in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strips where airplanes would take them back to the States , these drawers were not refrigerated . In the latest Army Digest . Wetzel read in an article entitled , " The Wonders of Body Evacuation , " that the body of a United States serviceman killed in Vietnam could be evacuated from a given battlefield and be back in the States in less than twenty-four hours . Implicit in the article was the message that the Army profited doubly by this efficiency : first , by not having to refrigerate the filing cabinets which held the bodies and , second , by always having empty drawers in the case of a major enemy offense . On a smaller wall , though , there was a group of the drawers that were refrigerated . In these drawers doctors would keep such perishables as sandwiches spread with mayonnaise , beer , mixer , etc . These would usually surround the " no-names " that were also in the drawers and were bodies being held for positive identification . Occasionally , during a rush , semi-positive identifications were made by Colonel Schooner or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zipped and shipped , telegrams sent and policies paid , All in all , it was a lot cheaper than expanded refrigeration . Wetzel opened one of these drawers . A man lay on his back in a torn and burned fatigue uniform . His face had been scarred to a charcoal anonymity and next to his left arm was some onion dip with a few pieces of potato-chip shrapnel in the center of the bowl . The no-name 's uniform had no identifying patches other than the one which read " US Army , " black on green so that he could n't be spotted by the enemy during nightfall . There were no dog tags ; they had probably been destroyed in the same fire that the man had died in , obliterated in the heat . The second before he decided anything , Wetzel noticed in the sunlight how very calm the no-name looked ; the pressure was off . The only thing left for him to do was to lie there and eventually decompose . Compose , decompose , he thought ; no matter ; there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it may be better than you deserve ; I 'm not really sure . But I 'll do my best for you . " He wrote Bauer 's name on the man 's chest with the regulation pen , zipped him in the plastic bag on which he lay , and , with his own heart beating with notable panic , transferred him to a slot in the non-refrigerated section . In less than two hours there would be another lift-off ; in less than ten the body would be on its way back to the States . Bauer , as his file had indicated , had no living family , no loved ones . The beneficiary on his Army insurance policy was a Teamsters local in Detroit , who , when they found out about Brother Bauer 's demise , would cancel his card , take the $10,000 , and have a wake with the corpse in absentia . Wetzel affixed Bauer 's dog tags to the bag . Then he went back to Personnel and cut orders to the unit that Bauer was supposedly transferred to , to drop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rosters . To the Army Records Center in St. Louis and to the Pentagon , Wetzel sent the following letter : Sirs : let Lt. Ernest L. Bauer , 0967543 , a short time in my command as Unit Transportation Ofiicer , was fatally wounded when trying to drive a burning truck away from our ammunition dump . Through his couragemts action , the lives of our entire company are in his debt . I there fore recommend that Lt Boner receive commendation for his valor , hopefully in the form of the Distinguished Service Cross . Lt Bauer lives in our minds as an example to us all . WILFRED KRIEG , MAJ , /NP-USRA 045338 6785th Inf Reg , Quo Hop , SEA Major Krieg , Wetzel had learned in the Vietnam Newsletter , had been recently captured by the VC , so there was little or no official way to check the story out . Besides , there was no time to check stories out . In the meanwhile , Wetzel knew that with the receipt of his letter , Personnel at Quo Hop would be desperately dummying-up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was far better than trying to deny it . If they did , there would be investigations , the Inspector General would insist on auditing all the reports filed in the time of Bauer 's supposed presence . It was better , far better , to change a few records , to forge Bauer 's signature in a few places . Wetzel also sent Quo Hop a belated copy of Bauer 's phony original orders , those that transferred him there in the first place . With them , Quo Hop would have nothing to worry about . It was now only a matter of hours before the Teamsters local would be notified . With the death of Bauer completed , Wetzel who had been short of breath ever since he had lifted the no-name from the " pending " to the " out " file , sat and slowly mused over what he had done . And indeed , it had been done . In its execution , he realized its infallibility . The huge wheels , though held on by plastic cotter pins , would run true ; turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Somewhere in St. Louis , Bauer 's duplicate file would be pulled and put into another container ; somewhere in the Pentagon , the decision was being made about Bauer 's decoration , Wetzel had done what the negotiators had been trying to do . And he did it without violence , without more destruction , and , the second he actually zipped the bag , without any personal hate . He wondered ; if one man could be so easily eliminated , what about a platoon of men , a company , an entire regiment ? It would be a graceful and honorable withdrawal . The Army had actually provided the framework for it to be done , what with each man 's complex file , the mass of orders and orders countermanding orders , the regulations that by their mere volume would have to lead to a notable contradiction  --  a massive one that could bring the Leviathan crashing from the sea . He would have to study it all more carefully before he went on . In the rearranging of the files , Wetzel did run into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for , the one which quite clearly outlined his way back to the States . It would work if he changed a few things on his own file , Other than that , it involved having a stateside contact locate an old man dying in a hospital and having the man claim that Wetzel was his son , his only family . The Red Cross would be notified and , in turn , would notify Personnel in Southeast Asia for verification . If the stories checked , in less than twenty-four hours , Wetzel could be at the old man 's bedside . And possibly the man would grab at the last of life  --  and the choice of the old man would have to be wisely made  --  leaving Wetzel at his bedside for the duration of his active obligation . It would be time well-spent , Wetzel conjectured ; he would give an old man , who may well have been in a war himself , some solace by telling him that , indeed , he was dying in vain , but that we all did . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it just got a little more complicated . " But Wetzel decided to forgo this loophole . He was onto something bigger , something far more worthwhile . Now , as he read through the regulations to see what else there was to do , he anxiously awaited the initial correspondence that would be crossing the Personnel desk . It was inevitable that the note would come from St. Louis , a response to Bauer 's urgent request . It would state as succinctly as possible , composed and typed by someone in Personnel : Dear 1st Lt Bauer : The reason that you were not paid on 1Jul68 was because you were killed in action a month preceding your request . You have been awarded the Purple Heart and the Distinguished Service Cross for your heroic service . Further explanation of this matter will be found in AR 167-18 , Sec. 8 , para 4 , " Payment Procedures .
