Few nations have received as much U.S. aid in recent years as has Pakistan-and few have used it so well . Since 1952 , some $3.2 billion in cash grants , loans and food have gone into everything from villages and power grids to harbors and hospitals , not to mention another $1.5 billion to modernize the military . So efficiently have the Pakistanis employed their aid to reach a healthy 6% economic growth rate that economists have begun to refer to the " Pakistan example " as a measure of achievement for underdeveloped nations . <P> Nevertheless , further U.S. assistance to Pakistan hung in the balance last week . The reason dates back to 1962 , when the U.S. first began pumping military assistance to Pakistan 's old enemy India , which faced invasion across the Himalayas by Red China . Pakistan 's President Mohammed Ayub Khan , already interested in the nonalignment game , found U.S. aid to India reason to move more swiftly onto a path of warmer relations with Peking , and more recently , Moscow . Ayub 's government-controlled press has also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which no doubt influenced President Johnson 's decision to withdraw his invitation to the Pakistani leader to visit the U.S. last April . <P> Early this month Washington increased the pressure with a diplomatic note advising Ayub that the next meeting of the aid consortium of the U.S. and eight other nations that had promised Pakistan a fresh $500 million had been postponed from July 27 until Sept. 27 . The message suggested that the interval thus created might be useful for ironing out U.S.-Pakistani differences . <P> In Rawalpindi last week , Pakistan 's Foreign Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto read the U.S. note to the National Assembly . The result , predictably , was outrage and indignation . " If we are not going to be ruled from No. 10 Downing Street , " said another , " then , by God , we are not going to be ruled by Wall Street . " Next day Ayub himself took up the cry : " If friendship impinges on the sovereignty and independence of our country and is against our interests , we no longer desire such friendship . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For the moment , Pakistan was suffering an acute case of hurt pride , and as one U.S. official admitted ruefully , " This is the worst our relations have ever been . "
