In all the talk about possible mobilization to meet America 's needs in Viet Nam , one nagging question inevitably arises . With 3,426,680 men in uniform , why should the U.S. have to call up reserves and expand the draft in order to give General William Westmoreland the 206,000. men he wants ? <P> The answer is that the armed forces are seriously short of riflemen . Nearly half of the nation 's fighting men are in the Air Force ( 904,062 ) and Navy ( 748,762 ) , and although a limited increase in the number of aircraft needed for logistical support of those 200,000 troops would be necessary , neither the Air Force nor the Navy would be sharply affected by mobilization . It is the Army ( with 1,477,019 men ) and the Marine Corps ( 296,837 ) that need new muscle . As of last week , both services were stretched thin , at home and abroad . <P> Bare Skeletons . In the continental U.S. , the Army last week had 800,000 ground troops , the Marines 180,000 . Only about 125,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deployed within or without the country on short notices for crisis duty . Key units include two brigades ( 8,500 men ) of the Army 's 82nd Airborne Division ( which helped quell the Detroit riots last summer ) stationed at Fort Bragg , N.C. , and three outfits committed to NATO exigencies : the 1st and 2nd Armored Divisions ( 14,500 men each ) at Fort Hood , Texas , and the 5th Mechanized Infantry Division , 14,300 strong at Fort Carson , Colo . <P> The Army is building a new infantry division , the 6th , at Fort Campbell , Ky. , but its 14,000 men will not be combat ready until September . The rest of the Army 's men in the U.S. are in schools or in training-many of them , ultimately , headed for Viet Nam as replacements or as part of the 18,000 more men assigned to meet the President 's earlier commitment of 525,000 troops ( currently only 507,000 ) . <P> The Marine Corps is already extended to the leathernecked limit . In the U.S. the Marines have their 2nd Division ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in combat readiness-an Atlantic reserve that must maintain seagoing battalion-landing teams with the Navy 's Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean , and for the Caribbean . Combat ready on the West Coast , the 28th Marine Regiment ( about 5,000 men ) is rattling around in California 's Camp Pendleton , a bare skeleton force whose departure would empty the West of Marines . <P> Elsewhere in the world , the Army has five divisions ( 232,000 men ) in Europe , two ( 50,000 men ) in troubled South Korea . Alaska ( 10,000 ) and Panama ( 5,000 ) are the only other sizable Army commitments ; the Marines also maintain an amphibious brigade of 3,000 men in Okinawa that in effect provides reserves for Viet Nam . On that bloody ground , the Army currently has 333,000 men , the Marines 83,000 . Clearly , any further thinning of force strengths across the world would leave the U.S. open to possible Communist flanking thrusts-which helps to explain Lyndon Johnson 's dilemma .                 @ @ @ @
