Even as a youngster in The Bronx , Mel Powell was a brilliantly advanced musician . At least that is the way he remembers it . Of course , his fledgling compositions did not exactly bowl over his piano teacher , who " seemed to prefer Mozart . " But it was already clear that Powell was something special . He completed high school at 14 , and started a precocious career playing jazz piano . " It turned out , " he recalls , with barely a smile of irony , " that I became magnificent . " <P> Apparently he did , for soon he was sitting in with top jazzmen in Greenwich Village . He was only 18 when Benny Goodman offered him a job in 1941 . Powell says : " I did him the courtesy of accepting . " Goodman remembers it a little differently : " He auditioned for me in a cubicle at my manager 's office . He was so scared that I had to ask a secretary to help me decide whether he was any good-I could n't tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who know his name remember Powell-as a vital , imaginative soloist with Goodman and later with Glenn Miller . <P> Twittering &; Rumbling . Today he is chairman of the composition faculty at the Yale Music School and an influential experimentalist in modern music . It seems hard to believe , but it is the same Powell-same impressive talent , same capacity for being impressed by it himself . Take , for example , the series of electronic pieces that he recently presented in a special concert at the Electric Circus , a Manhattan discotheque . It was more carefully planned and carried out than most such performances , and it amounted to a kaleidoscope of the new Powell music . There were shim mering , post-Webern instrumental sonorities , crackling percussion , taped voices , and electronic twittering and rumbling-all interspersed with theatrical episodes such as a bearded man bouncing on a trampoline under flickering strobe lights . <P> It was the sort of work that Powell 's colleague , Gunther Schuller , praises for " its fine , subtle detail-like Japanese calligraphy-which finally works up into a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one better . One brief set of the pieces , he says , " can sound like The Ring of the Nibelung and can seem to last four days . " <P> Powell 's progress from jazz to the avant-garde followed an improbable path . He married Actress Martha Scott after World War II , then decided to leave the insecure jazz life and settle in Hollywood as a studio pianist for MGM . One of his major assignments was recording backgrounds for Tom and Jerry cartoons . At first , the constant glissandos of cartoon music put blisters on his knuckles , but a fellow studio pianist , Andre Previn , showed him how to play them with a comb . Meanwhile , Powell pursued his studies in serious music . In 1948 he moved east to study composition with Paul Hindemith at Yale . By 1958 , when he was offered a professorship , he was already noted as a deft , if sometimes perplexing , composer for conventional instruments . His final step into machine-made sounds was only logical : many of his ideas became too difficult for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
