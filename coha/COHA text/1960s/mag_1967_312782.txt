Practically all of Fleet Street rushed to Punta Arenas , Chile , the world 's southernmost city . Sir Francis Chichester , 65 , the intrepid , unwavering yachtsman , was approaching Cape Horn-one of the most hazardous passages of his solo trip around the world in the 50-ft. ketch Gipsy Moth IV . Some 30 newsmen were on hand , most with little knowledge about exactly where Sir Francis was and less about how to find him . They set up a pool arrangement under which a few reporters and photographers would be put aboard a British frigate to pursue Gipsy Moth . <P> The London Times was not content with just a pool . The Sunday Times and the daily Times had bought exclusive rights to Chichester 's own account and had assigned a go-for-broke Australian , Murray Sayle , to handle the story . Sayle hired his own plane , lined up a Chilean pilot named Rodolfo Fuenzalida , whose normal work is to spot schools of fish . Fuenzalida had no hesitation about taking the job , even though the Chilean air force forbids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of violent winds . Despite the danger of overloading his Piper Apache , Fuenzalida squeezed in two extra passengers , BBC Reporter Clifford Luton and BBC Cameraman Peter Beggin . <P> After three futile attempts to find Chichester , the group gave it one last try . They could not have picked a worse day . They flew through a driving rainstorm and gale winds ; the ceiling was 600 feet . But 20 miles south of the Cape , they finally spotted Chichester , making about eight knots under a jib that looked the size of a bath towel . Huddled under the storm cover in the cockpit , Chichester waved . Fuenzalida made six passes at 60 feet . Luton was so excited that he recorded a complete commentary before he noticed that he had no tape in his recorder . In order to get pictures , Sayle and Beggin took turns switching seats with Fuenzalida . In the shuffle , Beggin kicked off the fuel control . Fuenzalida noticed it in time , switched the gas back on . <P> After a torturous half-hour , Fuenzalida nosed up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Over the Strait of Magellan , the oil pressure in the right engine dropped to zero , forcing Fuenzalida to turn it off . The Piper lost altitude gradually , just made the runway . Sayle headed straight for the nearest wirephoto machine in Santiago , and next morning the Times splashed its scoop on the front page along with Sayle 's pictures . Wrote Sayle : " The sight of Gipsy Moth plowing bravely through the wilderness of rain and sea was well worth it . "
