The U.S. has a whole catalogue of gifts bestowed on it by the Old World-the horse , borsch , Rudolf Bing , pizza , trial by jury , Pfannkuchen , the English sparrow and crab grass . Most arrived more or less by acceptable means , but the suburban affliction defined as " a grass with creeping or decumbent stems which root freely at the nodes " sneaked in . How it made the trip is a mystery . Perhaps , many years ago , it stole out of some Portuguese garden into the sea , and , just following its nodes , crept along the ocean floor like a living cable till it reached The Bronx . Not satisfied there , it moved on to plague the rest of the nation . This week Suburbia is again on Green Alert as the warming land sends crab grass busting out . <P> Germination has already begun in parts of the South , is relentlessly moving northward ( see map ) . The great , hopeful new weapon against the enemy is the " pre-emergence " killer , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the new chemicals is : Will they work ? Five companies this year are marketing such products , most of them priced between $9 and $10 for a package covering about 2,500 sq . ft. : Scott 's Halts , Dow 's Crab Grass Killer , Vaughan 's Pre-Kill , Pax 's Crabgrass and Soil Pest Control , Swift 's Rid ; others , presumably with names like Stomp , Unconditional Surrender and Do n't , are on the way . <P> Explosion . From all the evidence , killers do a fairly effective job if applied properly . Since the chemicals kill all seed , whether weed or good grass , the trick is to sow grass lawns in the early fall only , and to apply pre-emergent chemicals in the spring . By that time , all the good grass will have caught hold , and the killer chemicals will attack only the germinating seeds-the crab grass and other undesirable weeds-that remain . Even if used properly , however , the killers may cause some harmful side effects . <P> Compounds that contain calcium arsenate , for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zytron can harm fescues and bent grasses . Two new chemicals , calcium propyl arsenate and diphenatrile , have yet to be fully proved in all conditions . And as good as they are , none of the killers are 100% effective . Besides , no chemical can control the fellow next door , whose grass crabbed because he did n't use Do n't , and as a result the pest inches stealthily across the property line carrying the seeds ( about 50,000 per plant ) of a monstrous population explosion . <P> Short of atom-bombing one 's lawn ( or one 's neighbor 's ) , the only way to fight this infiltration is to get down and pluck . This requires , first , a cold , sharp eye and a strong back . Beyond that , it all depends on the gardener 's psychological makeup . One familiar type detests routine plucking , but he keeps alert enough en route to his car in the morning or to the backyard barbecue in the evening , and can spot , swoop and pluck without so much as a change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The second major type abhors garden work of all kinds , but when forced , kneels and begins working his way along the train of crab grass with such insatiable preoccupation that he soon disappears down the block , leaving behind a trail of bald spots .
