Beaming avuncularly at the reporters wedged three and four deep around his White House desk , the President observed : " I would say we all ought to be commended for our good spirits and jolly frame of mind . I appreciate the good humor you are all in . I do n't know how to account for it . " <P> Lyndon Johnson , looking trim and tanned , is in pretty good humor himself these days , and he is only too happy to account for it . He is optimistic that by continued persuasion and pressure - " the jawbone technique , " in Treasury Secretary Henry Fowler 's phrase - he can keep the booming U.S. economy from spiraling out of control . On the international scene , he can only be reassured by the strident argy-bargy between Moscow and Peking , despite some pundits ' predictions that the U.S. stand in Viet Nam could only induce harmony between the two great Communist powers ( see THE WORLD ) . As for the war itself , the President is firmly convinced that the patient and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Making It Right . Last week 's military actions in South Viet Nam more than justified that view . In eight separate operations ranging from the northern uplands to jungled War Zone " D " near Saigon , U.S. troops and their allies killed more than 1,900 of the enemy . At week 's end a battalion of U.S. Marines splashed ashore near the mouth of the Long Tao River , the main shipping channel to Saigon , to yet another foray , this one dubbed " Jack Stay .

In Operation Texas , six battalions of allied forces dashed to the aid of a beleaguered outpost at An Hao , then found themselves tangling with four battalions of hardcore Viet Cong and North Vietnamese troops . In five days they wiped out 485 of the attackers and crippled the unit as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been , it is the progress of the other war in Viet Nam-the peaceful construction program-that appeals most deeply to the President . The Administration 's efforts to help the Vietnamese people provide him , in addition , with an irrefutable answer to many of his critics . One leader of the anti-war movement , Saturday Review Editor Norman Cousins , wrote compassionately last week of the Vietnamese , " whose constant and unwanted companion has been violence and terror and whose only crime has been their geography . " They have , he said , a kind of " moral claim on history . " Yet , he asked , " How do we go about making it right with them ? " Johnson is determined to meet that challenge . Said he : " We are trying to concentrate our energies and all of our expertise and knowledge to help these people help themselves and have a better way of life .
