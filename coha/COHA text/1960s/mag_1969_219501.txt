They were all there-Cab Calloway , Earl ( " Fatha " ) Hines , Benny Goodman , Dizzy Gillespie , J. J. Johnson , Gerry Mulligan and scores of others . It was not a Bourbon Street reunion of the jazz giants , nor were they stompin ' at the Savoy . The man tinkling out Happy Birthday on the piano-with authority-was none other than a fellow named Dick Nixon , President of the U.S. " I 've never seen the place like this , " exclaimed a venerable White House butler as he distributed glasses of champagne from a silver tray . " It sure has lots of soul tonight . " <P> What else could be expected when the President throws a party in the White House for one of the greatest figures of American jazz , Edward Kennedy ( " Duke " ) Ellington ? Presenting Ellington with the Medal of Freedom on his 70th birthday-the first such award in the new Administration-Nixon said : " In the royalty of American music , no man swings more or stands higher than the Duke . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each cheek . <P> Agnew 's Style . It was not Ellington 's first contact with the White House . His father was a part-time butler in Harding 's day , and in the past the Duke himself has been honored with membership on the National Arts Council . But it was by far his most pleasant experience with a President . Besides Nixon 's Happy Birthday , played on the eagle-legged piano of the East Room stage , Vice President Spiro T. Agnew sat down to play two of Ellington 's own compositions , Sophisticated Lady and In a Sentimental Mood , in a surprisingly light , sophisticated style . <P> Black was the color of the evening . Never before had a White House dinner been so dominated by Negroes , and never before had a U.S. artist of the masses been so honored . " I voted against Nixon three times since 1960 , " said one black musician from California , " but after tonight , he could run for Grand Dragon of the Ku Klux Klan and I 'd be for him . " <P> Cynics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to win black support in just such a manner . The chances are that they would be wrong in this case . The idea for the party was suggested by Nixon 's old New York associate Charles McWhorter , a jazz buff , and Nixon , no jazz fan but the first piano-playing President since Harry Truman , enthusiastically endorsed it . Ellington did not participate in anyone 's campaign and , in fact , had not even met Nixon until the day of the party . The traditional political types were not invited , and the guest list was limited almost entirely to the Duke 's old friends . Most of them are musicians who could not carry a precinct . <P> They could , however , carry a tune , and rarely has so much talent worked for free and for fun . Mary Mayo and Joe Williams sang , and when Nixon and Agnew were not using it , the piano was rotated among Hank Jones , Dave Brubeck and Fatha Hines , who nearly sent its legs flying with a ripping rendition of Perdido . Best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improvisation of " something soft and gentle " on the name of Pat . Mrs. Nixon was enchanted .
