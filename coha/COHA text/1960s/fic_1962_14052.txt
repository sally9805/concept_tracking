New york . Early morning . The curtain rises on the Key Club , seen hazily through a gauze scrim . The room is filled with assorted types of night people , some in evening dress . They are singing , swinging , dancing . A wild " Dolce Vita " spirit prevails . Jimmy , a Negro with dark glasses and a beatnik beard , is pounding away at the piano and belting out a song of the thirties . There is a buzz of talk which rises and falls in waves , punctuated by bursts of demoniac , drunken laughter . This was once a beautiful private home , but that was long ago . Now it is a so-called " bottle club , " catering to a wide assortment of nocturnals . The walls are skeletal , relieved by patches of red and gold flecked paper , well antiqued . A small piano-bar stands at the foot of the staircase to one side . Dangling over it is a huge gold key . Clustered around the piano-bar are stools . Several steps of a staircase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the ground floor below . On the left in the rear , a graceful staircase winds up to another floor which continues as a balcony overlooking the main room . Upstairs off left of the balcony and unseen is the ladies ' room . At the top of the stairs rear of the balcony , is an elaborately carved Palladian door ; the extreme right of the balcony bellies out into the room forming a semi-circular area which was once a musicians ' gallery . A table and three chairs are clustered in this area which is set off from the rest of the balcony by a translucent screen . Underneath the balcony , in the rear is a long bar with stools in front of it . An elaborate curiously wrought iron chandelier dangles overhead . To the extreme right , set in space is a tall , double window surmounted by a pseudo-classical pediment . The window is heavily draped to shut out all light and noise . The rear walls are transparent and behind them we see the silhouette of the sleeping city . The moody lighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , the scrim casting a haze over the scene lend it a bizarre , somnambulistic quality . A young man in his late thirties , wearing a trench coat , comes up the stairs from the pit and looks out at the audience , contemplating the scene behind him , as if it were in his mind 's eye . He smiles crookedly , shakes his head , lights a cigarette . His face is sensitive , attractive , a little weak , perhaps , cloaked by a protective covering of cynicism . Behind him , above the clamour , words and phrases emerge clearly and then are swallowed up by the general din . He smiles wryly , nodding to himself . NEIL BENNETT Yes . There were many voices in the air that night , heard and unheard . They moved in and out of us like spirits . ( The songs rise wildly . ) There was song . ( Burst of drunken laughter . ) Laughter . ( A gentle voice emerges , " Yes , I love , truly love . " ) Love . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ) Hate ! ( An explosion of guttural sounds and a woman 's scream . ) And murder ! ( Suddenly , the action on the stage freezes . The people become living statues caught in the posture of the moment : the last three notes of the piano are repeated over and over again , caught in time . ) A " meaningless murder " the papers called it . ( Shakes his head . Laughs sadly to himself . ) Now , there 's a contradiction in terms . I ought to know . I am something of an expert on murder . I have a law degree that says so , and a medal that proves it , and , as a not too gentle reminder  --  I have a ghost ; and that 's where the story begins . ( The frozen scene behind him fades and vanishes . He stands there , on the lower steps , in a shaft of light . ) It was one of those uneasy , black , rainy nights when our senses become sharpened to subsurface things , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see him  --  my ghost . Paradox ? Close your eyes the better to see ? Yes , because the things I 'm talking of are best seen with the inner eye and heard with the inner ear . There are things we can only see in the dark . Stars , for example  --  they are there set in the sky all the day long , but you ca n't see them ; it requires night 's darkness to make them visible . I would say that the things that happened this night call for a quanta of darkness to reveal them . Well , if your eyes are closed , we 'll try our experiment  --  we 'll go walking on this rainy night . Ready ? Come along . You are walking with me on 54th Street , between Fifth and Sixth Avenues , at about one in the morning . We see something . We stop . There , leaning against a lamppost , is this fellow in a black raincoat , hat pulled way down . He 's making sounds as if he were sick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks at me . A strange , glossy face . And then , God damn , his face falls off like a mask ! And , underneath , he stares at me out of two black holes , because what 's left of his face is a half-mashed death-head . I stand there , paralyzed . For one awful second , I 'm sure that this is the man I killed in Korea come back from the pit to exchange bayonet thrusts . Then he murmurs in a horrible voice , something like : ( In a guttural strangulated voice : ) " Haa hitty , haa hitty . " Then , " Hell , Hell . " And I run , I mean , I run ! Ten , twelve blocks till I collapse on a stoop , gasping for breath . What was it ? In God 's name , what was it ? Some trick of light or imagination ? No , it was real , all right . A man . A human being . Then , I recall reading that there are many poor , tormented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the day they hide behind drawn shades , and only come out late at night  --  and even then , they wear masks so as not to see the look of revulsion on our faces . Now , two men passing by , stop , look at me . I cry out to reassure them : but my tongue is like cotton , my voice makes no sense ; it is gibberish even to my ears . And then , these two men turn and run , just as I had . And suddenly , I realize what that poor bastard was trying to say to me . " Haa hitty ! " " Haa hitty ! "  --  " Have pity ! " " Have pity ! " " Hell , Hell ! "  --  " Help , Help ! " ( The lights come up . ) Open your eyes . You wo n't see him any more tonight , I promise ; but you 'll see me , and with your inner eye , you 'll see him in me , and maybe , you 'll make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself . At least , you , of a tougher breed , will understand why a nineteenth century humanist , lost in the jungle of the twentieth century , decides that the only way to survive is to play it cool . And that 's my advice to you . Do n't get involved ! Do n't hate so much that you might want to kill ; do n't love so much that you might be obliged to kill . Be like me , an uncommitted nation . Thank you . ( A tiny flicker of yellow light appears off L. , grows ; and presently , two men enter the room , one of them carrying a lighted taper . In this dim light , we see the room now empty . Several of the bar stools are upturned on the piano and the bar . Frenchy , a thin man in his middle forties , with a pallid night-club complexion , and the crisp manner of an efficient maitre d ' , is in his shirt sleeves tying his black bow tie , setting ash trays , etc. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a red mess jacket . Frenchy flips a switch and the spotlight illuminates the piano . He snaps his fingers , points to a table : " Candle ! That table ! " The waiter nods , lights the candle on the table indicated. ) p. 3 FRENCHY ( Calls off . ) You set up in the kitchen , Juan ? VOICE ( Off . ) Si , si ! FRENCHY ( Calls off . ) Well , do n't sprinkle any cockroach powder on the chicken tonight . ( Turns on wall switch . The lights in the bar area come up . ) VOICE ( Off . ) Si ! No more than usual . ( Frenchy and the waiter remove the chairs from the piano and the bar , set them on the floor . Frenchy flips another switch ; the chandelier lights glow . The elaborately carved Palladian door opens , a rumble of heavy , guttural voices , a man-steps out onto the balcony . He is thick-set , slightly balding , immaculately dressed . As he descends the stairs , he addresses Frenchy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . FRENCHY Yes , sir . BARON And some cigars . FRENCHY ( To waiter . ) Scotch , the good stuff . Two . On the double .

BARON Upstairs . Did you catch Kazar on T.V. last night ? NICKI Yeah . ( Cigarette girl enters from downstairs . She is a hard , bleached blonde in net stockings and abbreviated costume . ) He 's crazy . SANDY Cigars , Mr. Baron . BARON Thank you , sweetie . ( Takes them . ) NICKI And I do n't mean noorotic .

Come on upstairs , Nicky . This is a public place . ( He takes the bottles , goes upstairs , followed by Nicky . They enter the room upstairs . As they open the door , a glimpse of men in shirt sleeves , angry growling voices . The door shuts , the sounds subside. ) p. 5 RAY ( To Frenchy . ) We open yet ? FRENCHY What have you got ? RAY A couple of basket cases . FRENCHY ( Snaps his fingers . ) My jacket . ( The waiter fetches his jacket . ) Members ? RAY No . ( Helps him into his jacket . ) FRENCHY Who ?

( He crosses to the edge of the stairs , bows to the customers coming up from the pit . ) Come right up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle aged man and his wife come up the steps into the room . They are dressed in evening clothes . He is a well to do business man in his fifties , balding , with sparkling , darting little bird eyes and a manner that goes with them . A bulbous nose , flattened and reddened by age , lips that go half way round his face and almost bisect it when he smiles , eyebrows , tiny dark , heavy triangles and a Charley Chaplin mustache , complete a visage which time , with its cruel tricks , has metamorphosed into a clown mask . Despite his pompous pronouncements , he is a curiously touching man . His wife , in her late forties , is chic , slim , well gowned , jewelled , a product of Elizabeth Arden , still pretty , but bitter lines have formed around her mouth which cosmetics ca n't erase . ) Welcome to the Key Club . p. 6 LEW BAGATELLE ( Smiles and nods , fishing out his wallet , poking it for his card and presenting it , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Anna is a beautiful film star , in her late thirties , with just a hint of a foreign accent in her husky voice . She moves , conscious of her beautiful body , with the grace of a tigress . Her hair is a mass of burnished gold wound up and held together by a jewelled clip . She has prominent cheek bones , slanted slits of eyes . She wears dripping furs over a tight gold sheath of a dress and long , silk gloves . Jggy , her agent , is a tiny , ugly , gnome-like , baldheaded man , his usual reservoir of self-importance is completely punctured by the driving wilfulness of his client. ) p. 24 LEW BAGATELLE Look !

( She rises and moves away from him . Turns , appeals to the audience . ) Who is this silly old man touching me ? I do n't know him . Where is the young poet I married ? The football hero in the raccoon skin coat ? That him ? Impossible ! ( Suddenly , fiercely , she takes up the knife on the table , brandishes it . ) Why do n't you die ? Die ! ( She stabs him several times . ) Die ! And free me ! ( Lew remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a gentle smile fixed on his face , his hand poised in space where it was patting Ceil . Ceil throws down the knife . ) No . I will be the one to die first ! I 'll dry up , wither away , and grow old and wrinkled and I 'll die and you will still be sitting there at my bedside , patting my hand , that idiot smile on your stupid fat face !

The three notes and Gia 's voice : " Black , black , black " Lew becomes animated , pats her arm. ) p. 43 LEW BAGATELLE She 's sighing ! Poor darling ! ( Lew rises , talks intimately to the audience closest to him as he walks around , the room . ) She 's thinking of Michael . She 's having a hard time . Make allowances . She misses the house . We should n't have sold it . Hotels ? Ech ! You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first years . Running up and down the stairs , arranging furniture , standing on the new chairs in her stocking feet hanging pictures . So beautiful she was . Is . Always . So young . Remarkable , in a woman of her age . Makes me want to cry . What I miss most about the house are the memories . They do n't change for me . The kids were still there for me , growing up . And Mike in every room ; Mike at the piano , singing ; his little voice so sweet . I still see him wandering from room to room wondering who these strange people are who 've moved in . I heard him calling : " Mamma , papa , where are you ? Where 'd everybody go ? Mamma ! papa ! " It 's all right , Mike , do n't be frightened . Papa 's here , mamma 's here . We 're thinking of you . In our hearts , nothing changes . ( He sings , softly : Michael 's folk song : " I gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freezes into his original position , smiling , his hand on Ceil 's .

The way Neil is looking at her ! Oh , something was between you ? Hot and wet and sticky ? Lovey ! Lovey ! No , darling , verboten . ( She pushes his face in another direction , then she turns , examines Gia , smiles . She runs her bands over Gia 's hair . ) But she is attractive . Exciting . Lovely breasts . I 'd like to make love to you , teach you . ( Anna turns away sharply in anguish . ) Stop looking at her that way ! Oh , Anna , some day you 're going to split up the middle , and one part will be woman , the other man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poor Neil . So square . I 'm going to have to take you apart piece by piece and make you over again until I can hold you in my hand . Like this . ( Holds out Her palm as if a tiny figurine were in it . ) No , I 'm not going to let you go , darling . Forget that . I need you . The woman part of me needs you , darling . I 'm going to drink you . ( She squeezes the imaginary figurine in her hand as if to catch his juices in a glass , then she drinks it . ) To the last drop . ( Anguished . ) Because if I lose him , oh , Anna , I can see it so clearly . You 'll end up a vicious , old dike in men 's clothes , pock marks all around your mouth .

The three notes and Gia 's voice : " Black , black , black " continues and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who crosses to Neil who is still immobile and says : ) p. 45 GIA MARINO Why did you come back ? I was beginning to forget you . You broke your promise . ( The light focuses on Neil . ) NEIL BENNETT Are you remembering , Gia ? GIA MARINO I must n't remember . NEIL BENNETT I 'm talking to someone and in the middle of a word or I 'm walking on a crooked street halfway round the world and suddenly I 'm back in your apartment on 12th Street , over the pizza shop and I smell the pizza baking , and the sun is pouring into the window , and the laughter and cries of children playing in the street outside float into the room , and in the apartment upstairs , a radio playing . ( He goes to her , starts to put his arms around her . ) GIA MARINO No , do n't touch me . Neil , please . NEIL BENNETT What 's wrong , Gia ? GIA MARINO Us . We ca n't go on like this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gia . Do n't let him make you beg . Oh , marry me , Neil , and I will shower you with such love . Ask me to marry you . Do n't make me beg .

( To himself . ) And the look of pain on her face , and I know what 's troubling her , and I ca n't help her because I ca n't help myself . GIA MARINO I 'm beginning to feel like a tramp . And I do n't like the feeling . NEIL BENNETT Gia , darling . ( Puts his arms around her . They embrace and kiss . Then Gia pushes him away . ) GIA MARINO No ! Please , Neil .

No reproaches and no regrets . ( She kisses him tenderly . ) Now , turn around and go out that door . NEIL BENNETT This is foolish , Gia . GIA MARINO When I count five , I want to hear the door slam and I do n't want to ever see you again . Goodbye , Neil . ( She turns her back on him . ) One . NEIL BENNETT Gia . You ca n't do this . GIA MARINO Goodbye . Two ! NEIL BENNETT She 's right , of course . She wants a home and children . Well ? It 's the answer . Is it ? For her ? Yes . For you ? No . Kids today , wearing dog-tags , a man with a pointy head somewhere presses a button and I see them fry in front of my eyes and not a damn thing I can do about it .

Neil has walked into darkness , and disappeared . Gia slowly crumples to the ground , sitting there , her head bowed , her face contorted . As if in the distance , we can hear her voice singing : " Black , black , black , Is the color of my true love 's hair . " ) I wo n't think of it . It 's past . I 'll think only of you , Will . My good , dedicated , kind , strong Will . I love Will . NEIL BENNETT Play it cool ; do n't get involved . One ghost at a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice : " Now !

( Kazar comes down into the room , walks around toward an empty table . ) It 's happening now . I 'm in Los Angeles , three thousand miles away , Sam Dubrowsky 's house . Dubrowsky , and three friends are sitting at the table playing cards . ( Kazar sits at the empty table as if there were , indeed , presences . ) And I 'm there , too , watching , invisible , sitting in a chair , like a puff of smoke . Space is an illusion , like time . It 's one thirty here , ten thirty there . I can see them so clearly . I can hear them . Dubrowsky laughs : " Ha , ha , ha ! " And suddenly , he stops . ( Kazar swings around , rises , looking at the corner of the room , pointing to the door . ) Two guys just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Black stockings with little holes cut in , and just the glint of their eyes shining through . ( As he talks , Kazar walks over to them as if he were joining their group . When he is close to the imaginary figures , he swings sharply around , pointing at the imaginary Dubrowsky . ) Dubrowsky starts to get up . ( Without turning to the imaginary assassins , Kazar signals to them with his hand , as he commands intensely . ) Now , boys ! Now ! ( Tow shots are heard in the air . Kazar says . ) Both barrels ! ( Two more shots are beard . Kazar , without glancing at them , waves the assassins to go quickly . He approaches the imaginary figure of the fallen Dubrowsky , breathing heavily , whispering hoarsely . ) He is lying there on the floor , only he is n't laughing now !

( Laughs wildly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something better than marriage , Neil . NEIL BENNETT ( Wryly . ) A marriage a la Loire . ANNA BRENN We 'd have such what ? A marriage what ? NEIL BENNETT During the French Revolution , they would strip a man and woman naked , tie them together front to front , and throw them into the Loire River  --  to drown . p. 75 ANNA BRENN Quaint ! NEIL BENNETT They called it " Marriage a la Loire . " ( Gia 's playing becomes softer , a tinkling , haunting melody , like a music box heard in the next room . A couple dancing to it , slowly float in from the bar area . They look as if they were drowned . The young man , an unreal , effeminate , pretty face , twines both his arms around the girl 's waist . His eyes are closed as are hers . Her head is thrown back , her hair streaming down , her arms hanging limp , her lips parted . They dance very slowly , turning round and round , two painted mechanical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Strokes one of her arms caressingly . ) Romantic people , the French . So inventive ! That 's how you picture us ? Naked , tied together , slowly floating down the Loire River undulating to and fro as if we were gently fornicating  --  and little clouds of nibbling fish escorting us . ( She smiles innocently . ) I rather like that picture . ( The somnambulistic dancers vanish back to the bar area . ) NEIL BENNETT Thought you would . ANNA BRENN Face it  --  it 's better than floating down the Loire River alone . And that 's what 's going to happen to you , Neil . p. 76 NEIL BENNETT Your turn  --  stick the pin . ANNA BRENN ( Intensely . ) Neil , I love you . NEIL BENNETT Sure . ANNA BRENN I do . NEIL BENNETT Anna , do n't play games with me . ANNA BRENN I know what you 're afraid of . I would n't humiliate you . Ever . NEIL BENNETT ( Laughs . ) Oh , Anna . ANNA BRENN I 'd be faithful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own way . ANNA BRENN I mean it . NEIL BENNETT I know you do . ANNA BRENN You do n't believe me . NEIL BENNETT I believe this Anna means it , this second , but the other Anna , next second ? ANNA BRENN ( Plaintively , a little girl . ) Neal , I 'm not like that . I 'm really very simple . My desires are very simple . ( Suddenly , fiercely . ) What other Anna ? NEIL BENNETT The one who could n't care less . The one who 's in love with death . p. 77 ANNA BRENN Do n't be ridiculous . NEIL BENNETT Look at your hand , Anna ! ANNA BRENN ( Fiercely . ) Look at yours ! NEIL BENNETT Mine ? ( He glances at his hand . He is clutching his whiskey glass , his hand wrapped around it tightly . ) ANNA BRENN The way you 're holding that glass ! Clawfingered , curled in , spastic . The normal person holds it like this . ( She holds up her glass . ) You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're clutching it as if you were afraid someone was going to take it away from you . That 's the sign of an alcoholic . NEIL BENNETT You 're reaching , Anna . ANNA BRENN You can drown yourself in a glass as well as the Loire River . That glass oubliette is your way of doing this . ( She holds up her bandaged hand . ) Am I right ? Slowly . Half measures . You wo n't make it , Neil . I know you . Those guilts . Oh , those guilts , hmmm ? Eating us up . You want to go home again , do n't you ? Read Tom Wolfe ! You ca n't . The world 's going to blow itself to pieces . No matter how tight you hold it in your sweaty little hand it 's going to blow itself up . You go back to the U.N . and try again , and I promise you , you 'll be so frustrated , one fine morning just about this time , four-thirty a.m. , you 'll be fed up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 'll float yourself down the Loire River alone . ( She holds up her bandaged wrist . ) Take it from a girl who 's been there . One word of advice : make sure the razor blade is clean . Mine was rusty . If they haul you out before you drown , you get a nasty infection . Takes ages to cure . My way is best , Neil . Come with me . We 'll eat , drink , swim , lie in the clean sun , fornicate , and to hell with them all . ( Neil is n't listening . He is looking at his glass , anguish and self-recognition and a hundred images he sees in the glass have made him suddenly mute and deaf  --  and oblivious to her . ) Neil ! ( She pinches him . ) Neil ! ( He ignores it . ) Stop looking at that damn glass ! What do you see in it ? ( After a long pause , during which Neil sits there staring into his glass , he speaks very softly ) p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The water chills us ; the sun burns us ; the liquor rots our brains ; sex becomes a disgusting ritual , not of love , but of hate . We will become two loathsome , ugly people . Zombies , living only on our mutual loathing . ANNA BRENN What 's the alternative ? NEIL BENNETT Work . Do our jobs . Use up our talents , or what 's left of them , justify our gift of life . And if the world 's to die , well , then , we must die with it , but as part of it  --  trying . ( He leans his head back , closing his eyes . On sudden impulse , Anna reaches over with her lipstick and makes a red slash across his throat . He opens his eyes  --  looks at her , smiles sadly . ) You see , Anna ?

Neil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( As he and Anna go . ) What 's with Neil , tonight ? ANNA BRENN The weather . An old wound is kicking up . ( They vanish into the bar . The Amazon showgirl and the ancient judge cross to front of the staircase , holding hands , and looking blissfully into each other 's eyes . She starts upstairs , remembers something , leans over , whispers . He gives her some money for the attendant in the ladies ' room . She looks at him , dewey-eyed , puckers her lips , making a kissing sound . He catches the kiss , puts it in the breast pocket over his heart , patting it romantically . She goes upstairs. ) p. 79 SONNY DRAKE ( To the ancient judge . ) All right , already . Let her go . The kid 'll have an accident on the stairs . ( Ceil laughs . ) You like that ? Oh , you are a good group ! ( Looks back at the ancient judge . ) He wo n't last the night . CEIL BAGATELLE But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SONNY DRAKE Brilliant ! Original ! Ha , ha ! Ooh , the pains !

LEW BAGATELLE ( Wearing his hat and coat , enters , strides vigorously over to Ceil with a firm show of strength , growls . ) Ceil , are you coming ? SONNY DRAKE ( Groans . ) He 's back again . ( Roars at Lew . ) You 're interrupting a mood . LEW BAGATELLE ( Roars back . ) Yah ! SONNY DRAKE Clever ! Witty ! What reflexes ! " Yah ! " ( To Ceil . ) See you later . CEIL BAGATELLE Alligator . ( He crosses to the bar , passing the over-rouged " rich bag " who is stomping across the room , sniffling , a handkerchife to her eyes , her lower lip stuck out , petulant and fuming with anger . Behind her , following closely and trying desperately to " explain " is the " pretty boy " with the tight , short jacketed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dancing . ( She keeps rejecting his frantic explanations with dismissive gestures as if she were sweeping him behind her . As he passes them , Sonny says to her in a stage whisper . ) SONNY DRAKE He 's lying . He 's really in love with me . ( Exit . ) LEW BAGATELLE ( Fiercely , shaking with wrath . ) My patience is at the end ! I warn you . I do n't have to put up with this . I 'm not a block of wood . I do n't want to start breaking furniture . You do n't know me , Ceil . I do n't know myself . I FRENCHY ( Crosses down behind Lew and taps him on shoulder . Lew ducks fearfully , cringes , his hands raised to ward off an attack , all his aggressive posture vanishes in a moment . Frenchy , gently . ) Your hat , sir . LEW BAGATELLE ( Sheepishly . ) Oh ! Oh ! Excuse me . ( Lew takes off his hat , looks at it , giggles foolishly . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the bar , Lew looks at his hat . Laughs ruefully at himself . ) Boy , oh boy ! Well , I got my second wind . I 'm wide awake . I 'm ready to tummel as long as you want . ( He takes off his coat , drapes it on the chair , sits . ) I was foolish , Ceil , I admit it . One drink too many . ( Pause . ) We 'll go back , Ceil . We 'll buy another house , Ceil. p. 81 CEIL BAGATELLE I do n't want to go back , now . I do n't want another house . LEW BAGATELLE We 'll make a trip around the world ; Hawaii , Japan , romantic places . CEIL BAGATELLE I do n't want a trip around the world , Lew . LEW BAGATELLE What do you want ? SANDY Gardenia for the lady ? CEIL BAGATELLE No . SANDY Lovely gardenia . ( Lew takes the gardenia , pays the girl , who goes . He holds it out to Ceil gallantly . ) CEIL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fandango ! ( He puts it in his teeth and does a few steps . She rises , looks at him with revulsion and goes up to the ladies ' room . Neil crosses over to him , smiling sympathetically . Lew grins sheepishly , takes the gardenia out of his mouth , sighs , shakes his head . ) LEW BAGATELLE This is not my night . NEIL BENNETT This is not our century . LEW BAGATELLE I owe you a lunch . NEIL BENNETT Forget it . LEW BAGATELLE It was a bet . I lost . p. 82 NEIL BENNETT You did n't have a chance . LEW BAGATELLE A terrifying man . ( Gia appears from the bar , singing . Neil crosses to her . ) NEIL BENNETT Gia . GIA MARINO Yes , Neil ? NEIL BENNETT Do you have any idea what you 're getting yourself into ? GIA MARINO Hm ? NEIL BENNETT With Kazar ? GIA MARINO Of course I do . NEIL BENNETT ( Shakes his head . ) No , Gia . GIA MARINO Stay out of my life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love making a mistake that can wreck their life , you have to do something about it . You have no choice . GIA MARINO Stop it , Neil . NEIL BENNETT He 's no damn good , Gia . GIA MARINO He 's the best man I know . NEIL BENNETT You 're out of your mind . He 's a monster . GIA MARINO I do n't want to even talk to you . ( Gia walks away . Neil follows. ) p. 83 NEIL BENNETT I 've got to make you listen . Please . GIA MARINO Do n't believe everything you read in the NEIL BENNETT Yellow press . GIA MARINO Yes . NEIL BENNETT Gia , I 'm a lawyer . I know his record . GIA MARINO And I know him . NEIL BENNETT For God 's sakes , Gia , you 've been around . You 're not a child . Those men he 's talking to upstairs , you know who they are ? GIA MARINO I 'm neither a child nor a fool , Neil . Of course I know who they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? GIA MARINO No ! And neither does Will . It 's his job to work with all kinds of people . NEIL BENNETT With gangsters and murderers ? GIA MARINO And who do you work with ? Who the hell are you to judge a man like Will Kazar ? NEIL BENNETT I 'm not judging him . I do n't give a damn about him . It 's you I 'm concerned about . GIA MARINO A little late , are n't you ? ( She walks away . Again Neil follows her. ) p. 84 NEIL BENNETT Gia , this is n't the end of your life . You 're young , you 've a career . GIA MARINO My career ! Bravo , Gia ! Duse of the garbage cans ! I 'm not a star-struck kid , anymore . I 've had the sawdust knocked out of me . I 've grown up . My career ? To be a good wife , a good mother , to build a home and an honest , solid life . That 's my career . That 's what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's what you do n't want . Period ! NEIL BENNETT You 're wrong , Gia . I want it more than anything in the world . GIA MARINO Sure . NEIL BENNETT Wanting something is n't enough . One has to earn it . One has to be capable of honoring it . I was fighting my way out of some personal nightmare  --  I could n't inflict it on you . GIA MARINO Why are we talking about this ? It 's past . It 's over . Done with . NEIL BENNETT Is it ? GIA MARINO Yes . You 're worried about me now ? Where were you then ? When the long night fell , when the wolves came howling around and I almost did n't give a damn . Then was the time to worry , not now . If Will had n't come along I do n't know . But he did and I thank God and he changed everything . He was gentle and kind and never tried to lay a hand on me . And , suddenly , men tipped their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . And I felt clean , and respected , and wanted . I wo n't let you spoil this for me . I need him . I believe in him . ( She is weeping. ) p. 85 ANNA BRENN ( Enters from bar and goes toward chairs where Neil and Gia are seated . ) My purse . I 'm not interrupting ? GIA MARINO No . ANNA BRENN Because I would n't want to do that . Those folk songs you sing , darling , they 're charming . ( Sings softly . ) " I know who I love , but the Lord knows who I 'll marry . " Irish , is n't it ? GIA MARINO Scotch . ANNA BRENN Scotch . Ah , those love songs ! So sweet , so touching , so imbecilic ! I 'm going upstairs to powder my nose . ( She runs her fingers gently over Gia 's hair . ) Do you want to come along , darling ? GIA MARINO ( Flinching . ) No . ( Kazar comes out of room talking softly to Baron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ANNA BRENN ( Touches Gia 's cheek , caressing it . ) Because your face is all wet and shiny . NEIL BENNETT ( Growls . ) Go away , Anna ! ANNA BRENN ( Laughs . ) You must n't be so insecure , darling . NEIL BENNETT I said go away . p. 86 ANNA BRENN ( Looks up , sees Kazar , smiles . ) Well , look who 's here . Anyway , you 'll make a fascinating consolation prize . WILL KAZAR What does that mean ? ANNA BRENN Do n't you know ? WILL KAZAR I 'm not good at riddles . ANNA BRENN You do n't like me , do you , Mr. Kazar ? WILL KAZAR You 're not a woman to be ignored . ANNA BRENN You have n't answered my question . Do you like me ? WILL KAZAR I do n't know you well enough to answer that . ANNA BRENN Then , perhaps we 'd better start getting acquainted at once . WILL KAZAR What 's the rush , Miss Brenn ? ANNA BRENN It 's just possible that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with each other . WILL KAZAR Thanks . I 'm flattered , but I 've got a girl . ANNA BRENN Have you ? WILL KAZAR Yes . ( Puts his arm around Gia . ) And a lovely one . I 'm a very lucky man . ANNA BRENN Neil , darling , what is that old Greek saying ? " Let no man call himself lucky ' til he 's dead . " ( Kazar goes rigid . She laughs mockingly and goes off . There is an awkward silence as Neil and Kazar look at each other . Kazar glances sharply at Gia who is aware of her tear-stained face and is embarrassed. ) p. 87 GIA MARINO ( Rises . Forces a laugh . ) Excuse me a minute . I 'll be right back . ( She goes . ) WILL KAZAR ( Kazar and Neil look at each other . ) Bennett , let 's level with each other . NEIL BENNETT All right . Let 's . WILL KAZAR Gia is a very special person . NEIL BENNETT Very . WILL KAZAR She only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WILL KAZAR She has no idea how rotten some people really are inside . ( Neil laughs softly . ) What are you laughing at ? NEIL BENNETT I was just saying something like that to her . Slightly different frame of reference , of course . WILL KAZAR I do n't want to see her hurt , Bennett . NEIL BENNETT Neither do I. WILL KAZAR But you have hurt her . And it is n't going to happen again . Not while I 'm around . I told you to stay away from Gia . I was n't kidding . NEIL BENNETT I did n't think you were . p. 88 WILL KAZAR Be smart , Bennett . Why do n't you get out of town ? NEIL BENNETT Is that a threat ? WILL KAZAR A promise . NEIL BENNETT Does n't frighten me . WILL KAZAR What does ? NEIL BENNETT Not dying . WILL KAZAR Living ? NEIL BENNETT ( Ruefully . ) You have a point . WILL KAZAR That condition can be corrected . NEIL BENNETT You make no bones about it , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line , it 's stupid to beat around the bush . That 's how wars start . NEIL BENNETT You know what I 'm afraid of , Kazar ? Not dying  --  killing . It gives you pretty creepy bedfellows . Believe me , I know . WILL KAZAR What 'd you ever kill , besides time ? NEIL BENNETT A man . WILL KAZAR How ? You talk him to death ? NEIL BENNETT I jammed a bayonet in his throat so hard I could n't pull it out . Satisfied ? But , you were right . " Living . " I find that hardest of all , living in a world with innocence so in need of a faith , any faith  --  that it will believe in what ? Pigs ? Lice ? Masquerading as saints . p. 89 WILL KAZAR Dangerous stuff  --  booze . I know it ai n't you talking , it 's a whiskey bottle , but you could cut your throat on a broken whiskey bottle , too . NEIL BENNETT Crap . WILL KAZAR You 've got a dirty mouth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words would you use for embezzler , blackmailer , arsonist , demagogue , liar ( Gia returns . Neil sees her , stops . ) GIA MARINO What 's going on here ? WILL KAZAR Mr. Bennett here has been making some charges , Gia . GIA MARINO I do n't want to hear . WILL KAZAR In fairness to yourself , you should . GIA MARINO No . WILL KAZAR In fairness to me , then . Go on , Bennett . You were saying ? NEIL BENNETT You 're pretty cute , Kazar . WILL KAZAR Go on , Bennett . NEIL BENNETT No , I do n't think so . WILL KAZAR You started this  --  finish it . " Embezzler , " you said . Right ? NEIL BENNETT Right . p. 90 GIA MARINO Please do n't . WILL KAZAR Go on , Bennett . NEIL BENNETT I 'll show you the records , Gia . GIA MARINO Do n't bother . NEIL BENNETT I 'll send them to you . GIA MARINO I 'll tear them up . WILL KAZAR Go on , Bennett . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no use . WILL KAZAR Go on . Truth will prevail . NEIL BENNETT Crap ! WILL KAZAR I do n't like indecent language . What kind of a way is that to talk in front of a lady ? GIA MARINO It 's all right , Will . WILL KAZAR It 's not all right . He talks that way in front of you again , I 'll tear his tongue out by the roots . NEIL BENNETT Indecent language ! Ho there ! Behold the defender of the faith ! Decency is such a valuable commodity , you 've taken that over too , have you ? GIA MARINO Stop it , Neil . Do n't mind him , Will . He does n't know what he 's saying . NEIL BENNETT Oh , do n't I ? p. 91 GIA MARINO Be quiet , Neil ! You 're drunk . NEIL BENNETT Yes , I am drunk . And that 's a pity . I should be sober . I should be stone cold sober so that what I say has a thousand times more point and bite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WILL KAZAR Go on and say it then , Bennett .

GIA MARINO I do n't want to hear any more . ( To Neil . ) You had everything going for you , Neil , and you threw it away . And you have the gall to stand there and attack a man like Will Kazar , who had nothing to start with but courage and vision ; who pulled himself up by his boot-straps  --  educate himself ; made a position for himself , is fighting for his people , building a good new world , while you slop around with your two-bit superiority . You dare to criticize him ? You 're not worth his little finger . You 're drunk and disgusting . Now get out of my life and stay out . WILL KAZAR The lady make herself clear ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got anything more to say ? NEIL BENNETT I 'm drunk and disgusting . I apologize . ( Bows ironically . ) GIA MARINO You ca n't even do that with grace . Come on , Will . WILL KAZAR Just one more GIA MARINO No . Please . WILL KAZAR All right . Take it easy , honey .

But I try to use it , not let it use me . Why did n't I tear his tongue out ? Do you know why , Gia ? Because I had to make you see him clearly . Because I knew if I gave him enough rope he 'd hang himself . And he did . When right is on your side , you prevail . Sooner or later , people show their true colors .

Through the walls , we catch a glimpse of the city , its towers painted by streaks of dawn . The early morning sounds of the awakening city faintly penetrate the shrouded window of the Key Club . The wild burst of activity has left the guests exhausted and soaked with perspiration . Jimmy is sprawled on the piano , some guests leaning on it , laughing softly . Ray brings him a drink . He takes it . Gia is playing her guitar and singing a haunting ballad . A girl yawns as her escort tallies the bill , pays Frenchy , tips him , takes the arm of the young girl . Sonny , seated with Ceil , has just finished a joke and he laughs wildly . SONNY DRAKE So he says , " Up yours . " Is that the greatest ? ( Ceil laughs , stifling a yawn .

My life ? A big deal ? What would I lose ? A few days ? A couple of weeks  --  a couple of bad T.V. shows ? To live in fear ? That 's not such a bargain . Death does n't mean that much .

WILL KAZAR ( Roars at Frenchy . ) What do I care if they burn the joint down to the pavement ? Disappear ! Go in the kitchen . Do n't get me excited , will you ? Go away ! Get out ! ( Frenchy retreats to the head of the stairs . Kazar turns aside a moment , digging his nails into his clenched hands , making an effort to control himself . ) CEIL BAGATELLE ( To Lew . ) You started something !

WILL KAZAR For a long time , you have been Number One in my black book . So now we come to it . What the newspapers call the Moment of Truth . You ever have a bad dream  --  over and over ? The same dream  --  night after night ? I 've been dreaming like that about you , Bennett . For six months You know what I dreamed ? I dreamed you 'd walk into a room I pick up a steak knife ( He picks up a gleaming steak knife and thrusts it in Neil 's direction. ) and stick it right in your yellow heart . GIA MARINO ( A cry of disbelief . ) What 's happening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my eyes . Even your voice is a stranger 's . I do n't know it . I do n't know you . WILL KAZAR I 've got many sides .

( Wiggles his fingers in front of Neil 's eyes . ) What do you see ? Five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing on a rock looking up at a great fireball in the sky ? Not snakes coming out of a woman 's head  --  one look 'll turn you to stone ? Not the earth exploding in your face ? Just a hand ? Not the hand of a leader of men ? Not the hand of History ? GIA MARINO ( Moving between the two men . To Kazar . ) Will , ca n't I make any impression on you ? WILL KAZAR Impression ? Oh , little sweetheart ! You 're in me like that knife . You got a face like an angel . But a bottle of acid in that face , a razor at night , a car smashes into you the doll-face of yours turns into a living nightmare . And how 'd you like to live with that , Bennett ? Am I pushing you hard enough ? p. 129 NEIL BENNETT Yes . Yes . ( He picks up the knife , aims it at Kazar 's throat . ) GIA MARINO ( Grabs Neil 's hand , shrieks . ) No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do it . ( Turns to Kazar fiercely . ) All right ! Make my face a living nightmare . Go ahead . He wo n't have to live with it You will ! I 'll see to that . I 'll haunt you with it . You walk outside your door , I 'll be there on the street with my nightmare face . I 'll point a finger at you and scream " Murderer ! " Because you are . It 's written on your forehead in big , red letters  --  " Murderer . " You murdered Dubrowsky , did n't you ? WILL KAZAR No , Gia . No . Wait ! GIA MARINO You lied . ( To Neil . ) He lied . He knew it four hours ago . He lied . ( To Kazar . ) And you expect to make me your accomplice ? No , Will , no . I 'm not going to lie for you .

Everything 's going too fast . We do n't know what we 're saying any more . It 's all out of control . ( He grips his head in his hands , shuts his eyes tight , breathes deeply , trying to control himself . When he takes his hand away and opens his eyes , they are filled with tears . ) Gia ! Little sweetheart ! Forgive me . I 'm under such a strain . I 've got a thousand problems . When I 'm all geared up like this sometimes something grips me by the throat and I say terrible things I do n't mean . It 's like someone else inside me speaking . Forgive me . I need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my life . Needs I have so terrible , only you alone can help . ( To Neil . ) Look ! Be a good fellow . I do n't want to hurt you . Go away . Gia , tell him . Go away and leave my girl alone . That 's all I ask . GIA MARINO I 'm not your girl ! I 've just seen something in your face that will haunt me till the day I die . I despise myself for having been so stupid ! ( She crosses to Neil . ) Neil , take me home . WILL KAZAR Do n't do this , Gia ! I warn you . NEIL BENNETT ( Looks at the knife in his hand , throws it to the floor . ) Come on , Gia . ( He takes her arm , they start down the stairs ) p. 131 LEW BAGATELLE ( To himself . ) Now ! It 's going to happen . Now ! My insides are like ice ! My hair 's standing up ! I know . It 's now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ( Kazar has been standing there as if turned to stone . A demonic look comes over his face , he walks over , picks up the knife from the floor , stealthily and swiftly goes after them like a cat stalking . Gia and Neil are unaware of Kazar behind them as he catches up to them , raises the knife . ) ANNA BRENN ( Screaming . ) Kill them ! LEW BAGATELLE ( Yells . ) Look out ! ( He jumps up and , with surprising speed , dashes over , throws himself between them , pushing Neil and Gia aside so violently that they fall backwards to the floor . The group seems to explode in all directions . As Kazar strikes , the knife describes a gleaming arc and catches Lew in the chest . Ceil screams . Neil picks himself up . Kazar , stunned , drops the knife . Neil crosses to Lew who is lying on the stairs . Gia rises , moves to Lew . ) NEIL BENNETT You all right ? LEW BAGATELLE ( Sits up , smiles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LEW BAGATELLE Do n't get excited . It 's nothing . ( To Neil . ) How about you ? Are you all right , boy ? NEIL BENNETT Yes . LEW BAGATELLE The girl ? Where is she ? Where 's Gia Marino ? GIA MARINO Here I am . LEW BAGATELLE He did n't hurt you ? GIA MARINO No . LEW BAGATELLE Good . I never saw anything like that . He 's a wild animal . ( To Kazar . ) Did anybody ever tell you that ? You should n't be walking around loose . NEIL BENNETT ( Kneeling beside Lew . ) You 're hurt ? LEW BAGATELLE ( Laughs feebly . ) No . Nothing much . ( He examines his wound . ) A scratch . Not bleeding . Just a few drops . Lucky . NEIL BENNETT Let me see . ( Opens Lew 's shirt . ) LEW BAGATELLE Close , hm ? NEIL BENNETT Yes . LEW BAGATELLE ( Laughs . ) He was right on top of you . I had to move fast . You ever try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of you . p. 133 NEIL BENNETT Take it easy . LEW BAGATELLE Boy , what a scare ! I did n't think I would make it . GIA MARINO But you did . LEW BAGATELLE By a hair . ( Nicky , the Baron , the boys and Frenchy come running down the stairs . ) FRENCHY Gese , I knew it . I told you . BARON What the hell happened here ? CEIL BAGATELLE He stabbed my husband . BARON Why ? Billy , what happened ? WILL KAZAR I do n't know . This joker came at me out of nowhere . I did n't even know him . NEIL BENNETT Frenchy ! Call a doctor ! LEW BAGATELLE I do n't need a doctor . ( Laughs . ) I 'm all right . I 'm fine . Really . NEIL BENNETT Of course you are . Frenchy ! FRENCHY Yes , sir . ( Goes to phone . Lew tries to rise . ) NEIL BENNETT No , no . Just lie there . Relax . You 'll be okay . WILL KAZAR Hurry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't try to get up yet . LEW BAGATELLE No . I 'll just sit here a minute . Catch my breath . NEIL BENNETT Atta boy . LEW BAGATELLE Phew ! Winded . NEIL BENNETT I know . CEIL BAGATELLE Lew ? Why did you have to ? LEW BAGATELLE A minute more . I 'll be all right . It 's a little close in here . Smokey . ( He waves back the smoke , gasping . ) GIA MARINO ( To guests , crowding around . ) Please step back . Give him some air . ( She rushes to the window  --  pulls open the drapes , throws open the French window . A shaft of bright , white light bursts in on the room , altering everything and everybody . The room becomes shabby and cheap . The people 's faces drawn and pale . One golden sunbeam seems to float in on the wave of shattering light . ) LEW BAGATELLE ( Points to it . ) Daylight ! So bright ! Going to be a beautiful day . A sunbeam ! ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dubrowsky 's voice : ) I drink it . See ? I am immortal . ( In his own voice . ) Whose voice is that ? ( The others freeze , the lights dim . ) Better . I can get up now . ( Rises . ) There ! ( Takes a deep breath , walks around with a sprightly step . He straightens , seems to grow taller , laughs : ) Oh , boy ! Caught my breath . Ready to tummel . ( He stretches . ) I feel good . I really feel great . ( Kicks , does a time step . He turns around and turns to the immobile figures . ) What 's happening ? You are all disappearing . Must be the smoke in here . You , Kazar ! Your face . It 's turning into a skull . Boy , oh boy , my imagination is really working overtime . Who are these people just came into the room ? Tall , beautiful , golden ! ( He turns as if someone were tugging at his jacket . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you like that ! Son of a gun ! ( Gia 's voice is heard singing : " I gave my love a cherry " Lew turns as if another figure had entered the room . ) Michael ! Give poppa your hand . ( He starts to sing . ) " I gave my love a cherry " Oh , Michael . It 's going to be a beautiful day today . ( Sings. ) " that had no stone . " ( He sits on the stairs as if Michael were sitting with him , leans back singing softly , closes his eyes . The lights come up on the others who become animated . They are all staring at Lew who is on the steps . Neil is bent over him , holding his hand. ) p. 135 WILL KAZAR What 's the matter with him ? Where 's the doctor , Frenchy ? FRENCHY I 'm ringing . NEIL BENNETT ( Rises . ) It 's no use . He 's dead . CEIL BAGATELLE Dead ? WILL KAZAR What ? Ca n't be ! No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BRENN ( Suddenly staring hypnotically at the dead man . ) It 's hideous . Must n't look . Run , run . Neil , let 's get out of here . ( There is a chorus of " Yes "  --  " The police "  --  " Come on "  --  " Let 's get out ! " Several people rush to the stairs . Neil blocks their way . ) NEIL BENNETT Nobody can leave this room . There 's been a murder . ANNA BRENN The plane 's waiting , Neil . They 've got to shoot the picture . I ca n't get involved . NEIL BENNETT You are involved . Sit down . IGGY We ca n't afford to get NEIL BENNETT We are all involved . ( To Anna . ) Sit down . ( He gently pushes her into a chair . Kazar moves like a sleepwalker toward the stairs . Neil blocks his way . He looks at Neil dazed . Quietly : ) You just killed a man , Kazar. p. 136 WILL KAZAR I had no choice . ( Looking up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old joker came at me like a wild thing . You saw . BARON We saw nothing . ( He shrugs his shoulders , makes a gesture of washing his hands and goes upstairs . The boys follow him and disappear into the room . Gia prays silently . ) CEIL BAGATELLE ( Cradling Lew . ) It 's a bad dream . It 's not true . Oh , Lew ! My darling ! My poet . Do n't leave me . He was such a good person . NEIL BENNETT A brave man . GIA MARINO A sweet man . CEIL BAGATELLE Everything my heart desired , he gave me . And I was so cruel to him . WILL KAZAR Everything going for me , and out of nowhere this son of a bitch I do n't even know , where 'd he come from ? Who is he ? Who is this guy ? ( Neil goes to his knees , takes Lew 's hand , begins to cry softly . The growing morning sunlight bathes Lew 's face as the distant scream of a siren approaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ashen , shrunken , turns to the people in the room and cries out in anguish : ) Who is he ? Who is this man ? ( Gia crosses herself. )
