Dr. Alexander Brunschwig of Manhattan 's Memorial Hospital has literally disemboweled hundreds of patients during the past 17 years . In almost every case , the list of organs he has removed would seem to be a surely lethal loss . But Brunschwig 's viscerations - or pelvic exenterations , as surgeons prefer to call the incredibly drastic operations - have been a startlingly successful effort to save lives after all hope was gone . <P> In a newly published French monograph , L'Exentration pelvienne , Dr. Brunschwig reports that no fewer than 116 of his 562 patients have lived five years or longer after the operation . Virtually all have been glad that they submitted to the extensive amputation , even though many have had to wear a bag strapped to their waists to collect urine and feces . Some have been able to work for years , with no outward sign of their condition . <P> Touring &; Swimming . Dr. Brunschwig , a surgeon and gynecologist , decided as long ago as 1934 that some cancer patients for whom all other treatment had failed might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any so far attempted . He began , usually in cases of stomach cancer , by removing most of the stomach , half of the left lobe of the liver , the body and tail of the pancreas , the spleen , the transverse colon and part of the abdominal wall . Of the first 100 patients , 19 lived for one to ten years , including a laborer who went back to doing a full day 's work ( TIME , March 17 , 1947 ) . <P> Among women there were even more severe cases in which massive cancers had spread from uterus to large bowel and bladder , or from bowel to uterus and bladder . For them Dr. Brunschwig devised a still more radical operation , removing not only the vagina , cervix and uterus , but much of the lower colon and also the bladder . This necessitates making an artificial bladder from a section of small bowel , or leading the ure ters into the colon , which then empties both urine and feces into a " wet colostomy " bag . After more conventional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only fecal matter passes through the " dry colostomy " opening in the abdominal wall , because the bladder and urethra are left in tact . Since no two patients ' diseases are alike , Brunschwig operations vary in the number of organs and length of bowel removed . <P> One man was well enough to make a transcontinental tour eight years after exenteration for cancer of his rectum and bladder . A woman of 35 , whose operation spared the lower part of her pelvis , was having a normal sex life and went swimming seven years after surgery . Dr. Brunschwig 's most extreme case was a woman who lost many internal organs , including the left kidney , plus all related lymph nodes , along with her left leg and hind quarter . Eight years later she is living happily and doing all her own housework .
