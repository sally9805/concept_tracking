txt Policemen who want more schooling arc about to get a boost from Uncle Sam . A new Office of Academic Assistance is gearing up in the Department of Justice under a provision of the 1968 Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act . When it opens its doors , it will have $6.5 million in grants and loans for law-enforcement officers and students planning police careers . And in the next fiscal year it expects another S20 million . Purpose of the aid , to be available for the January , 1969. semester , is to bolster the size of local police forces as well as their social and professional stature . Most police-related courses now are heavily concentrated in junior colleges . The new office , which would like to see these courses spread to four-year colleges , plans to set up model university police education programs . So look for more police officers on college campuses ? but without the billy clubs . They 'll be toting textbooks like the rest . 0 Washingtonians are getting their first earful of local campaign oratory since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Columbia Board of Education  --  the only public office one can run for here . Until 1967 , even the school board was " above politics . " Its members were named by judges who were themselves White House appointees . Then last year Congress relented to permit an elected board . Most district dwellers hope this breakthrough will be the forerunner to home rule . For those who win seats in November , the challenge is an imposing one : How to achieve quality schooling in a system beset with racial unrest where nearly 95 percent of the students are nonwhite . Young Americans for Freedom has launched a new drive to scuttle East-West trade . It involves a massive fund-raising appeal to conservatives aided by Sen. Strom Thurmond ( R ) of South Carolina . The Senator 's " Dear Fellow Americans " letter mailed on YAF stationery this week outlines the strategy . " The November elections , " he says , " may be the last chance we will have to reverse this suicidal policy of trading with the enemy . " Last year YAF was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing business " with Communist nations . This year International Business Machines is the target . How and why ... Charles M. Haar has an idea that should appeal to people who live near airports but do n't have cloth ears . Mr. Haar , assistant secretary of Housing and Urban Development , proposes that airports obtain a lease from property owners for the right to make noise for a stated stretch of time , perhaps two or three years . At the expiration of that period , if the property owner should prove loss in value suffered due to noise , he could collect damages . The airport operators would then pass along the increased costs ( due to these damages ) to the airlines through higher rents for landing rights . And the airlines most likely would then take more interest in development of quieter engines . Far out as Mr. Haar 's suggestion sounds , it has n't been tossed out the window .

Despite its woes , the F-111 actually has a flight record which compares favorably with many other planes developed in recent years . True , within about 15,000 hours of flight time nine F-111A 's and two F-111B 's have crashed . And all are once again grounded while officials determine whether further alterations are needed . But an Air Force study of other fighter aircraft shows that in the same flying time 28 F-100 's , 15 F-102 's , and 21 F-104 's crashed . Figures are not available for the F-4 Phantom at 15.000 hours , but in its first 10 , - 000 hours seven of that type ? which has proved reliable in subsequent service ? crashed . But flight record or no , acceptance of the F-ill has suffered . The Navy decided not to buy the F ? 111B version . The British backed out of a Wanner ' purchase . And now the Australians are having qualms . But most sources still believe the plane eventually will pull up and out , triumphing over its current adversities.     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
