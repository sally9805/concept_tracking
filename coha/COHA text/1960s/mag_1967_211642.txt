The Hawaiian dark-rumped petrel , the blunt-nosed leopard lizard , the Santa Cruz long-toed salamander and the Col orado River squawfish - to say nothing of the timber wolf , the grizzly bear and the American alligator - may soon go the way of the dinosaur : to extinction . <P> According to Interior Secretary Stew art L. American Udall , no species - 14 fewer than 78 mammals , native 36 birds , six reptiles and 22 varieties of fish - are on the brink of vanishing from the earth forever . In almost every case , their deadly enemy is man . The Indiana bat , for instance , is in danger because the caves in which it lives have become tourist attractions and because of acts of vicious vandalism ( two boys killed 10,000 in Carter Cave , Kentucky , pulling them off the ceiling and trampling them to death ) .
