txt In the following interview , California 's Gov . Ronald Reagan details his views on the presidency , big government , Vietnam peace negotiations , the Pueblo incident , the " new politics " of liberalism , and other subjects that are occupying public attention in this presidential year . You are sometimes charged by critics with giving simple answers to complex problems . What do you say to that ? I say , what are the alternatives ? For example , they say I have a too-simple answer in Vietnam . Yet I read where Ambassador W. Averell Harriman is getting a house with a year 's lease while casualties in Vietnam are reaching new highs . We have the experience of Panmunjom where 20,000 Americans were killed during two years of negotiations . That war ended when a new president Eisenhower came in and got the word to the enemy that we were going to reassess our options , Suddenly the enemy decided we could terminate the talks . I have said if the delegations are going to negotiate  --  are going to reach a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By William Mores Gov . Ronald Reagan " Something has to be done to force the enemy to get with it and meet with us in serious discussion . . . . Actually , there are far more examples of this approach to settling problems in our history than otherwise . " Further reproduction prohibited without permission . *Reagan asks warning to Reds // ment  --  I have learned from my own experience in labor negotiations that you must have something of action on your side  --  or talks fail . If specific Paris peace talks are not started soon  --  if we do n't even know after a reasonable time whether Hanoi is showing good intent or making some effort to meet with us on a peace  --  then we ought to reassess our position . Do you think we should invade North Vietnam ? This would be one of the courses of action the enemy might think about . Up until now North Vietnam has been a guaranteed sanctuary .

In fact , during his campaign for president some critics accused him of oversimplification and even demogaguery when he said he would go to Korea if elected . But Ike did bring about an end to the war . Actually , there are far more examples of this approach to settling problems in our history than otherwise . Thomas Jefferson dealt with the pirates in this decisive manner when he said " an insult unanswered is the parent of many oOthers . " What is your concept of the presidency ? I never believed the president should have all the power that has become his in the last few decades under liberal presidents . The executive was never intended to have $100 billion to spend as he sees best . A president must have faith in the people 's ability to manage its own affairs and solve its own problems .. I do n't mean by this a laissez-faire type of government . Government must , of course , take care of some of the needs of the people . I would like to see the president go to business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask them what they could do to help solve our domestic problems . Ask them , too , where we in government could best act to help them get the job done . The same with the farmers . Government is always telling them what they must do . Government should go to them and ask them what we should do . It is time government stopped telling people what to do  --  but , in stead , to ask them what we can do to help them in solving their problems . What could a president do about reducing big government ? He could make a dent . He could not do it all , of course . Even in a state like this one there are built-in practices of government that ca n't be changed . It is like fighting a pillow . What sort of president do we need in Washington ? I think a president could awaken people . He should be able to rally their support and move the nation in a constructive direction . A president must be willing to use his persuasive powers more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new law . A president has to return to some of the basic principles underlying this new experience of ours  --  and it is still a new experience after nearly 200 years . One of the great mistakes we have made is to follow the slogan of " the greatest good for the greatest number . " This is dangerous , saying that 50 percent plus one will determine what is best for this country . What about all the other people in the country ? This is n't the kind of government our founding fathers set up . People are hungering for leadership in the presidency today . I feel that people are much smarter than most politicians give them credit for being . The people want to be told candidly about their troubles . There is nothing more frightening than uncertainty . It is up to leadership to say , first , " This is wrong " and , secondly , " This is what you must do . " This is applicable today in international problems , economic problems , urban problems , and elsewhere . Could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be done . But what the people need is a man who would take office and say , " I may never run for this office . again . But in these four years I am going to make decisions for the people 's welfare no matter what political results there may be . I 've been told by my congressmen that bureaucracy in Washington is so big that they can no longer cope with it . They feel that only in the White House can things be done about this situation . One , to reduce it in size and , two , to reduce it in power . What about the so-called " new politics " of liberalism  --  this talk among some Democrats of using the private sector in solving problems , of giving power back to the people . Sen. Robert Kennedy was talking this way . And Hubert Humphrey is talking a bit this way now . They talk about all of the wisdom not residing in the bureaucracy in Washington . And they talk as though they were the very first persons ever to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thing that Democrats usually criticize Republicans for saying . And why are they doing this ? Because they want to stay in office . I could take you back to my speeches in the 1966 election . I found then that the people  --  Democrats and independents as well as Republicans  --  had discovered they were not benefiting from the Great Society  --  but just paying for it . They had come to see that government did not have the answers . People are seeing that there are basic problems in our economy . They see paychecks getting bigger  --  but they also see inflation causing them to come out behind . They know there is something wrong in the way our gold is disappearing from this country . I think the Democrats see all this , this new mood among the people . They see that in an election year you have to make a noise . Will the " noise , " as you call it , be effec-tive ? With the Democrats you have to question the noise . You have to look at their backing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their own supporters . You earlier spoke of what you thought should be done in Vietnam . How about the Pueblo incident ? In the first 24 hours after the Pueblo was taken , we should have said to North Korea : " We want our ship and men back  --  or we will take appropriate action . " We would n't have to say exactly what we would do . But it is important that you point out that the next step is theirs . Finally , Governor , if at the convention the party would turn to you as a vice-presidential candidate , would you accept a draft ? No , I have made my position clear on this .
