txt In medieval terms , the Communist envelopment of this four-square-mile Marine combat base represents siege warfare in slow motion  --  with giant puffballs of barbed wire rather than castle walls protecting the allied encampment . The state of siege is still fluid . The Communists , if they choose , could vacuum-seal the tiny American outpost . But the American command , for its part , could break the Communist siege with a massive troop influx in a manner now being publicly discussed . In Communist terms , Khe Sanh represents positional warfare of the third and final phase of guerrilla warfare , which the Communists deem necessary to sustain their military momentum and achieve their political ends . Total envelopment Dien Bien Phu , the tactical defeat of French colonial forces which was launched 14 years ago last week , is the Communists ' . historical precedent for Khe Sanh  --  if they elect to try a repeat of history . Yet , no one here is certain that Khe Sanh fits into the same decisive political framework as Dien Bien Phu . To the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sanh represents the " battle of the bunker " as one termed it . The siege of Khe Sanh is not simply a one-dimensional encirclement of the camp . It is a tri-dimensional envelopment in the air , on the ground , and underground . The Communist siege of the airways is partial , permissive ? and worsening significantly . The Communists monitor almost all of the radio traffic between Khe Sanh and superior headquarters . They know of American planes approaching Khe Sanh at the same time as American air officers . The situation is considered so severe that one American officer , in an attempt to pre* // *Communists lay three-way siege to Khe Sanh // vent the Communists from hitting a downed aircraft a second time , deliberately misled his senior command by saying the plane could not be repaired . He hoped the , Communists would not waste another round to hit it again . The senior command , not catching onto the ruse , insisted the plane could be repaired and radioed it was dispatching a repair crew to Khe Sanh . Thirty minutes after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plane , sending it into flames . Antiaircraft attacks rise The siege of the airways includes a .50 caliber machine gun positioned off one road of the runway which systematically rakes every low-altitude aircraft approaching the camp . " I 'll bet we 've spent a million dollars worth of bombs to knock out that weapon of Charlie 's the Communists , " one air officer explained , " but it 's still firing there every day . " The significant new development , however , is the suspected Communist introduction of antiaircraft weapons around the base itself and along the aerial path of approach . For low-altitude aircraft making supply drops or landing on the airstrip , there is only one approach into Khe Sanh  --  and only one way out . " We saw little black puffs of smoke off the wing tips of that Phantom a doublethe-speed-of-sound jet fighter bombing only 500 meters outside our perimeter the other day , " one officer explained . " And those black puffs indicate antiaircraft fire , although we have n't yet confirmed it . And , because of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C-123 with 49 passengers and crew last week coming into Khe Sanh . Red missiles possible " The difference between the .50 caliber machine guns that have been hitting our planes and antiaircraft weapons is enormous . A .50 caliber peppers the plane with little holes , and if one hits a sensitive part of the plane , it may crash . . . . But a 37mm. antiaircraft weapon is more precise , and its round can knock off a whole wing or the tail , or whatever it hits . " The Communists have the capability of escalating their antiaircraft weaponry around Khe Sanh up to the introduction of surface-to-air missiles which might be used against the bombers of the B-52 Strategic Air Command that four to six times a day support this base camp . American officers believe that elaborate electronic countermeasures could protect the B-52 's against the SAM 's however . The entire spectrum of American air activity is crucial to the defense of Khe Sanh . First , the major part of supplies into Khe Sanh comas by air  --  in what is becoming one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in at an altitude of several thousand feet above the camp , or else are dropped on aluminum sleds as the aircraft skims three to four feet above the airstrip . Even the most intense antiaircraft fire would not prevent supplies from being airdropped in , reliable sources report  --  though difficulties might arise for American Marine ground troops securing the drop zone , which now lies outside the base perimeter . Even radar-controlled airdrops from 30,000 feet could be used , if necessary , to get supplies into Khe Sanh , these sources say . Small targets difficult Air strikes , along with artillery , are the heavy fire-support weapons upon which the allied defense of Khe Sanh rests , especially in the event of a massive Communist ground assault repeating Dien Bien Phu . Both the tactical fighters and Strategic Air Command bombers would be jeopardized by any increased effectiveness of Communist antiaircraft weaponry in the future . American air-strike power now is facing two strategic difficulties more serious than Communist antiaircraft fire , however . First , air strikes , as well as artillery , are not now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a lone Communist machine gunner or the Communist artillery placed on the reverse side of the mountain in Laos . Second , the Communists appear to have dispersed their troop units enough to have negated in part the powerful concentrations of bombloads that continually rain throughout the mountains and valley of Khe Sanh . The Communists appear at this time to have allowed permissive trafficking of sup plies into Khe Sanh . " The Communists want just enough to get through so the marines will not leave Khe Sanh , " one reliable source explained . Mr officers troubled While the North Vietnamese have either been unable or unwilling to devise a completely tight air siege of Khe Sanh , air officers are still extremely worried about air operations other than supplies  --  notably the landing of passenger transports and helicopters for the evacuation of the wounded . A " junkyard " of burned-out helicopters and transport aircraft along the Khe Sanh airstrip attests the difficulty of landing and taking off from here . " A cardinal principle in air operations demands that we hold the landing zones and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But we do n't . When we do n't we get really worried  --  and I 'm really worried now . The Communists can close this air base up tight . " Communist strength unknown As he spoke , the Communists lobbed mortars and artillery at the airstrip throughout the day . No planes landed . Only emergency medical evacuation helicopter runs were made ? and many wounded were wounded a second time by incoming fire as they were running to or being carried to the aircraft . On the ground the Communist siege is total  --  but not necessarily permanent . The American command could break out of the Khe Sanh perimeter with a king-sized offensive sweeping operation around the base . The Communists ' strength around Khe Sanh is officially presented as two divisions  --  or roughly 30,000 North Vietnamese troopers . But no one knows if there are actually 300 or 30,000 around the base . The marines have been ordered by their superior headquarters to stop patrolling , except for securing the supply drop zone . A handful of Vietnamese Ranger and special-forces patrols leave the camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perimeter wire before being ambushed . Recently , one wounded Vietnamese lieutenant , whose patrol was ambushed 300 meters from his own lines , waved away reinforcing units , which would also have been ambushed  --  and then committed suicide to save the approaching unit . Several weeks ago , the last platoon of marines to leave the combat base was ambushed on the adjoining ridgeline . The marines were unable to retrive their dead and wounded . Surveillance constant The Communists have the base under constant and close surveillance . In one case , a marine sniper was peering through a small slit hole in a bunker , attempting to hit a North Vietnamese sniper  --  and the North Vietnamese started firing at the marine through the aperture . The glow from a flashlight on the airstrip on the darkest night brings a one-minute reaction from Communist mortars on virtually the exact spot . The Communist surveillance includes forward observers who spot for and adjust the North Vietnamese artillery located six miles across the Lao border . It takes as little as three minutes from the time a Communist forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round hits the coordinates , military sources say . Trenches advance American air strikes are called in daily , sometimes as close as 200 meters from the marine lines ? so close the marines are ordered into their bunkers to escape the flying fragments . Secondary explosions from a Communist supply cache have been heard from as close as 1,000 meters to the base perimeter . American artillery tubes are regularly lowered to fire like a giant rifle , instead of their long-range indirect trajectories , at a Communist recoilless rifle on a ridge only 300 meters from their position . Each night , when the fog descends on Khe Sanh " not like little cat 's paws , but in great big steps , " as one marine explains , the Communist diggers move their open trenchlines closer . In most cases the trenches are 200 to 300 meters away , but in some cases they are only 15 meters away ? and along the wire of the Vietnamese Ranger battalion , they are up to perimeter itself . The Communist slit trenches , which maintain no overhead cover , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system leading through the gulleys and up the hillsides to the west , east , and southeast of the camp . Tunneling sounds heard Even more critical than the slit trenches of the Communists , however , is the marines ' underground war . The Communist siege under the ground is considered embryonic , mysterious  --  and perhaps decisive . Some marine officers think  --  though they do not know for certain  --  that the whole Khe Sanh base sits on top of an elaborate French-made concrete tunneling system . They argue that if the Communists can construct a minisubway system under the marine wire  --  and connect with the suspected French-made concrete tunnel works  --  then the marine positions can be blown up by a Communist-made volcano-under them . Already Communist tunnels have been found leading under the Vietnamese Ranger position on the southeast fringe of the camp . Eight-foot metal poles have been regularly spaced out in the special forces camp , and day and night an American , armed with a doctor 's stethoscope , takes soundings of the Communists ' digging beat . Diggings have been heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by excavating down 10 feet , have thus far failed . Electronic sensing devices have also been used , but these have been too sensitive to be successful . Marines ' dig in ' The tunnel situation can best be visualized from one small hill knob within the marine perimeter . The hill , which has no name or number , rises roughly 300 yards above the plateau of the base camp proper . On top of the hill lies a marine command post , camouflaged with Iwo Jima-style nets . The commander , knowing the Communists have his post zeroed in , has started his marines at digging out the inside of the hill . The result is an underground labyrinth , damp and lighted only with candles on C-ration cans , reminiscent of the catacombs . Midway down the hill lie the marine line positions , in trenches and bunkers . But occasionally the clink of Communist shovels swaddled in burlap can be heard by the marines . The Communists are suspected of digging under the hill knob at its base . Every morning the marines search for tunnel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
