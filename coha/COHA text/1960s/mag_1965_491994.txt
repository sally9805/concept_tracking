THE scene is a cool , marble-and-glass building on a quiet side street in midtown Manhattan . In an office on the fifth floor an associate curator named William Seitz is cooking up what promises to be either the next outrage or the next fad in modern art : a February exhibition called The Responsive Eye . It will feature dizzying paintings of concentric circles , 3-D compositions of metal and plastic , and diamond-pattern Plexiglas constructions . Three floors below , families and couples holding hands swirl through the bright , spacious lobby . At right , matrons rummage intently through stacks of elegant postcards , art books and reproductions , which are for sale . At left , bright-eyed young girls help people who are seeking membership or simply conversation about art . Out back , in the large , airy sculpture garden , beatniks and businessmen bask in the sun at outdoor tables , eating , and looking at the statues , rectLaignEar pools , and gray-marble steps and walls . This is New York 's Museum of Modern Art , the capital of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looked at objectively , the whole scene has the air of fantasy , because 35 years ago the museum was n't there at all , and modern art in New York enjoyed a st  --  tus about equal to that of bootleg gin , except that it was less respectable and much less in demand . The fantasy , however , is not only real , but is a key part of the extraordinary success story of modern art in America . Thirty-five years ago the few modern works in New York were in private hands , and neither museums nor museum customers were much interested in them . Last year , when the Museum of Modern Art unveiled a new sevenmillion-dollar wing , 5,000 invited guests , including the First Lady of the United States , celebrated the event with champagne . Thirty-five years ago New York had a handful of collectors and galleries . Today the city boasts more than 400 galleries , at least a half-dozen museums which display contemporary art in varying degree , thousands of collectors , and several young painters who knock down as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its critics by making newness a sign of respectability , not of rebelliousness . As a result , " modern " art now seems to mean most of the art of the past 75 years and all of the art from now on , and the statement " I do n't like modern art " has become just about impossible . Credit for this extraordinary change in the standing of modern art belongs largely to the Museum of Modern Art , which in three decades has grown from a brash revolutionary into a powerful institution with the largest paid membership , and the greatest influence , of any museum in the world . The battle for modern painting is only one of many which the museum has fought and won . The museum has also battled for modern architecture , photography , good design in everything from vacuum cleaners to coffeepots , movies , and even TV . It has a film library with 3.000 titles . It owns some 7.000 prints . 7,000 photographs and 4,000 items of design . It has sent so many exhibits around the globe  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries  --  that it keeps a map with red pins to indicate where its shows have been . It teaches art to 1,700 adults and children a week , ships art material to 130 New York City schools a month , sends some 85 movies to schools and study groups a week , and has published 326 art books , many of them the best available on their subjects . It has an Oscar  --  sent by Orson Welles , who won it for writing Citizen Kane . He lent it to the museum a few . years ago when its movie division was considering a show of his films and , says the library 's Margareta Akermark , " We 've never been able to catch up with him to give it back . " The museum even has recognized that most maligned of creative efforts , the TV commercial , and recently put together , for loan to interested study groups , a package of the best plugs . As a result of this large-scale reformist zeal , just about everybody in the country has felt the museum 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the same Sucaryl bottle which decorates her crumb-flecked kitchen table was cited for beauty in a 1959 show on The Package . A secretary lunching at Woolworth 's might be surprised to hear that the museum has commended the design of the " juicy " O 's in the Woolworth sign . Stan Musial and Roger Maris were surely pleased to find baseball bats designed by their companies in a glossy 1962 exhibition called Design for Sport . Anyone who has enjoyed My Fair Lady is in debt to the film library : Lyricist Alan Lerner and composer Frederick Loewe , who based their Broadway hit on Shaw 's Pygmalion , spent days in the library repeatedly viewing the only traceable movie print of Pygmalion . Consumers everywhere have been affected by Piet Mondrian 's once-controversial lined paintings in the museum , which have heavily influenced advertising style . The stodgiest bankers work in modern office buildings inspired by the International Style  --  glass walls and little ornamentation  --  which the museum helped bring to prominence . But if the museum has changed the public , the public has also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garden and the movies as lures , more than half its 700,000 visitors each year go there for something besides the paintings . " When I was a young man in New York , people used to meet their dates under the clock at the Biltmore Hotel , " Monroe Wheeler , director of the museum 's Exhibitions and Publications , said recently . " Now they say , ' I 'll meet you at the museum . ' And the museum means this one . " This development has also brought on what might be called the criticism  --  namely , that the museum is box-office crazy . " It has become a fetish with them to have something sensational to hook the public with  --  and they do n't care what public , " one gallery owner said with a snort . " You go there and you see kids holding hands  --  instead of going to Central Park , they now go to art museums . " The criticism is a variation on an old theme . Soon after the museum was founded , the director of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a " Museum of Fashionable Art , " and the alarm has been sounded regularly ever since . Today it is Pop Art  --  whose practitioners paint soup cans and movie stars  --  which is being decried both as Fashionable and Silly . Or " Or art ( paintings that create weird optical effects ) or kinetic sculpture ( structures that move ) . But today 's Mamma are often sounded discreetly out of the museum 's earshot , because the museum , to its chagrin , has become the most powerful molder of taste in the art world . The museum dislikes the tag of " taste maker , " and it has n't become one without a fight . In fact , its founding director and guiding spirit , Alfred H. Barr Jr. , has waged a determined and patient campaign to keep its walls from becoming hallowed . In 1929 Barr warned that " the value of all contemporary art is debatable and much of it is certainly transitory , no matter how important it may seem to be to us at present . " In 1942 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may often guess wrong in its acquisitions . When it acquires a dozen recent paintings , it will be lucky if ... in . twenty years only one should survive . " " In any case , " he wrote in 1963 , " let those who love the paintings from the Museum of Modem Art be warned , and those who do n't , be comforted ; they are not all ' masterpieces . ' " Recently he referred to him . self as " probably at least half blind . " Barr 's disclaimers have been ineffective . " The art market reflects everything we do , " says curator Peter Selz . " Even when we show a master like Monet or Rodin , his prices go way up . In 1960 1 did an art-nouveau show Ion the " whiplash " style of design popularized by Louis C. Tiffany at the turn of the century and sure enough everything from Tiffany glass to wallpaper was suddenly back in fashion . " It is a measure of the museum% success in making modern art respectable that the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's personnel . " Art is almost too popular now , " one curator sighed recently . " I sometimes wish people would forget about it and get back to life . " Such a thought would have been unimaginable back in 1929 , especially to the three society ladies who conjured the museum into existence . One of the city 's leading collectors of modern works then was an unmarried society leader named Lillie P. Bliss , and she had to keep her Ckzannes , Gauguins and Picassos out of sight in an upstairs storeroom , because her mother forbade her to corrupt the walls of their town house with them , In 1929 , together with two other collectors , Mrs. John D. Rockefeller Jr . and Mrs. Cornelius J. Sullivan , Lillie Bliss persuaded a banker named A. Conger Goodyear to head a group to raise money for a museum of modern art . Within three months Goodyear and the ladies had a museum director : a 27-year-old Wellesley teacher named Alfred Barr , who then was teaching the country 's first course in modern art . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We have one great thing at the museum , and that 's Alfred Barr , " says architect Philip Johnson , who is a museum trustee . " He has energy , will and evangelistic fervor , and a sense of history and an eye so young and brilliant he makes sheep out of the rest of us . " Barr , whose Wellesley course incorporated such things as movies and design , arrived on the scene with the present museum virtually a full-blown concept in his own mind , and he even set it down in what is now known as The 1929 Plan . The only major developments he failed to foresee were the publishing division and the establishment in 1953 of a truly permanent collection ; the original plan had been that the Museum of Modern Art would gradually feed its masterpieces to the older Metropolitan Museum of Art and concentrate on relatively new work . But Barr 's schemes often seemed too ambitious to the trustees during the museum 's formative years . and he lost a few early battles . He was turned down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trustees reluctant to recognize the movies as art . " I understood their reasons and thought they were very wise , " he says . But I 'd urge them , little by little . " Barr is a mild , precise , scholarly looking man , but he has a clear and penetrating eye , and both his father and grandfather were Presbyterian ministers . " 1 suppose I have a strain of reformism and proselytizing in myblood because of my Scotch Presbyterian ancestry , " he says . The museum opened its doors in a midtown office building at 730 Fifth Avenue on November 7 , 1929 , and no fledgling enterprise ever had less humble beginnings . The first year 's budget was $100,000 , and its first show was an exhibition of paintings by Cezanne. van Gogh , Gauguin and Seurat , an all-star lineup which created what one critic called " the event of the century . " ( The opening proved auspicious for another reason . It was there that Barr met his wife-to-be , art historian Margaret Scolari . ) That first show lasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second show , Paintings by 19 Living Americans , was panned as inconsequential , as many of the subsequent Living Americans shows have been . But by the third show , in 1930 , the museum was drawing so many visitors it almost failed for succeeding : It was threatened with eviction because some of the building 's other tenants complained that museum visitors were monopolizing the elevators . Surviving this crisis , the museum proceeded to give the first U.S. exhibition of modern architecture in 1932 in a show of what Barr christened the International Style ( Mies van der Rohe , Gropius , Le Corbusier and Dud ) . Thenthe museum offered the show to other museums , and when a dozen of them put up $1.000 each to share the cost , the first museum traveling-exhibit department was created . The country got its first look at Machine Art in ' x333 with a show that offered for a ) tion a ship 's propeller , a cross in of undersea cable , and a gasoline pump . The Film Library was set up in 1935 ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with that , all of Barr 's 1929 Plan was in operation . It may have been too much , too soon ; as though determined to prove that success had n't taken away its spirit , the museum went on a virtual binge of broad-mindedness . In 1943 it put on display a tackily elaborate shoeshine stand which had been decorated , over many years , by a bootblack named Joe Milone . Barr called the stand " jubilant as a circus wagon . " but the critics said that Barr was losing his artistic grip . Hard on the heels of the shoeshine stand came a show of crude amateur paintings by a retired Brooklyn slipper manufacturer named Morris Hirshfield , whose subjects all had two left feet . Models for slippers , Hirshlield explained , were always left-footed . That was too much even for some of the Museum 's best friends . Goodyear wrote trustee Stephen C. Clark that the show was ' ' perhaps the silliest we have ever had , and that I think is saying a good deal . " Two months later Barr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " adviser , " For four years the museum was an uncertain , undirected place . Then . in 1947 . Rene d'Harnoncourt was appointed director . D'Harnoncourt is an American citizen who once was entitled to use " count ' ' before his name , is of French-Austrian descent . He stands sixand-a-half feet tall and is a primitive-art expert . D'Harnoncourt immediately brought Barr back from limbo and appointed him director of museum collections . The place has been relatively stable ever since . But absolute stability is a state that the museum may never achieve . It is populated by ambitious experts whose opinions often clash . and . according to one friend of the museum , " everybody is jockeying for position . " Its stability also is continually threatened by physical dangers . In 1958 a lire killed a workman , did $300,000 worth of damage , and destroyed two Monets . And like any museum , it is always prey to thieves . Last year a valuable Pascin sketchbook was stolen , but subsequently recovered . The museum 's only other recent theft probably illustrates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken in 1958 , but the thief , guilt-ridden. later called to say that he had left it by the front door of the museum . It was found propped against a glass wall , and the repentant thief was never caught . Perhaps the most hazardous of all is the withering fire the museum has drawn from a constantly changing , and thus bewildering , array of critics . It has been picketed by abstract artists for showing realistic paintings , and by realistic painters for showing abstractions ( " The Museum o 111/torten ) Nonsense ? " ) . 1t has had sculptures held up by U.S. Customs on the grounds that they were " building material , " Realistic painter Thomas Hart Benton once declared he would sooner see his stuff hung in a saloon than in the museum . Edward Hopper 's famous House by the Railroad was the lirst painting acquired by the museum in 1930 ) , but by 1953 Hopper was leading a group which charged the museum with favoring " mere textural novelty " while showing ' ' irresponsibility , snobbery and ignorance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , two of them have expressed less than enthusiastic personal views of modern art . Harry Truman called it " the vaporizings of half-baked , lazy people . " Dwight D. Eisenhower , confronted by a Fernand Leger , remarked , " To be modern , you do n't have to be nuts . " The museum remains constantly under attack ; many old-line artists find today 's abstractions inhuman . Three painters whom the museum has bet on in recent years are Mark Rothko , who paints giant . monolithic blocks with cracks of space between them ; Barnett Newman , whose canvases of solid color are broken by a thin vertical line ; and Ad Reinhardt , who paints the famous " black on black " canvases . " Somebody once said to me , " a fellow painter remarked , " that Mark Rothko lowered the blinds , Barney Newman closed the curtains , and Ad Reinhardt turned out the lights . " I ntramuratjalabingaside , the museum is catching it today on other counts . It is accused of ruling over a court of art consisting of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to sell , and certain nouveau riche collectors who have money and want social position through as.4.nriation with the museum 's elite trustees . The museum 's influence on the market is measurable , A few years ago Alfred Barr bought several paintings of targets by an imaginative young painter , Jasper Johns . Johns 's reputatiOn skyrocketed , and has n't come down yet . Measuring the museum 's effect on the painters themselves is a more difficult and intriguing job . " I think the average artist is not venal , " Ben Shahn , a realistic painter long on good terms with the museum , said recently . " What he really wants is praise  --  he wants adjectives . And he 's going to look to the meadow that offers the greatest adjectives . A youngster today , seeing Pop Art in the museum , is going to turn to Pop Art unless he 's a pretty strong individual , and not many are strong when they 're young . " Many of the museum 's veterans look back with nostalgia on the nice old days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was a nice , small museum , and we all saw each other , and we were pioneers , " says Allen Porter , who this month retired as the museum 's assistant secretary . " Then suddenly we were famous . I hope the place does n't get any bigger and lose all its personality . " The Museum of Modern Art is hardly nearing its dotage , however , and it still has not had the influence on American thinking that many on its staff would like . " When you say ' an artist , ' at least nine tenths of the American people think of a painter , " Alfred Barr said recently . " And that is very sad , because they 're affected much more by the other arts than by painting . " Even in the field of painting the museum is still working with evangelistic enthusiasm . One of its happiest manifestations is the Education Department 's Art Center , which encourages art appreciation in thousands of New York children and adults a year and is now evangelizing all over the globe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ features magnetic picture makers and a lazy Susan offering everything from feathers to burlap for the making of collages , now has a permanent counterpart at The Children 's Museum in New Delhi . The Indian Carnival drew 6,500 children in its first six weeks . Some observers actually detect signs that the museum has been getting spryer recently . " I 've always felt that the museum was a mere fifteen years behind its time , as opposed to most museums , which are thirty-five years behind the time , " says Ivan Chermayeff , who designed the five brightly colored banners that now fly above the museum 's entrance . " And now it 's closing the gap even more . They have a much livelier and less academic view in everything . " It is undoubtedly the museum 's mix-ture of rashness and care that has made it so successful , and the mixture often seems dazzlingly eccentric . One of the current shows , by a free-lance art expert named Bernard Rudofsky , is called Architecture Without Architects , and features " primitive " dwellings , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towns . Rudofsky first proposed it in 1941 . Recently Pop-painter Andy Warhol , at the museum 's request , submitted part of a movie he had made called The Longest Kiss , which consisted solely of an epoch smooch that lasted two hours . After watching a 15-minute condensation , the museum curators rejected it . " They kept saying , ' Send us movies , send us anything , ' " Warhol says . " And when I did , they were shocked . " Then there is The Responsive Eye , which the museum has been working on for more than a year . Defining the criteria for acceptance , a museum staffer said , " If it makes you almost sick to your stomach , it 's bound to get in . " Four years ago curator Peter Selz put on the famous Homage to New York , a noisy , complicated contraption by a Swiss named Jean Tinguely. which played records , shot off fireworks , and finally destroyed itself in the museum 's garden while an invited audience and New York firemen looked on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Selz says . Perspective on the museum will be easier to get because of its new wing , which has doubled its exhibition space . The Departments of Drawings and Prints , Photography , and Architecture and Design now have permanent exhibition room for the first time . In the past it has been easy for the public to shrug off the museum 's showings of loudspeakers and propellers as temporary eccentricities . " But if they see a propeller in the permanent collection , " says curator J. Wilder Green , coordinator of exhibition programs , " they 're going to have to say , ' They may be nuts , but they mean it . " For perspective on the relationship between the museum and the public itself , there is no better authority than Alfred Barr , whose farsighted plans have brought a public reaction which surprises even him . " What interests me about our murseum , in its social and economic structure . " Barr said one day last month , " is that first we have on our board half the names associated with very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rockefellers . Under that are 3,000 people who give us $50 a year . Under that are around 30,000 who are minimum members , at $18 to $22 a year . And then under that are student members , and under that are the people who pay a dollar for admission . The museum earns roughly two thirds of its income from the sale of books , admissions and memberships . I do n't know of any museum that can match this support at all economic levels , and none of us in 1929 had any intimation that this would happen . " During the coming year , Lillie Bliss 's paintings , which went to the museum at her death in 1931 , will be seen by nearly a million people . And Lillie 's painters , whom the cognoscenti once *sneaked in to see , have become so established they are almost old hat . Recently , a precociously hip eightyear-old stood in the lobby and surveyed a Picasso sculpture called She Goat . " That 's not bad , " he said to a chic woman with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grandma . " But the clearest measure of the museum 's achievement and its remaining challenge probably comes from Abe Chanin , a lecturer at the museum , who has been explaining art to the public for 18 years . " People are much less hostile now , " Chanin said recently , after a lecture on Jackson Pollock 's No. 1 , 1948 . " A lot of them still do n't underjtand Pollock , and Mondrian 's Broad-Way Boogie Wnogie is always good for an argument . On the other hand , Picasso 's Guernica used to infuriate people , and now it 's accepted as a classic . And i there 's another sure way you can tell their opinions have changed . People i used to tell me that their five-year-old child could do as well . Now , " he con , eluded happily , " it 's gone up to seven or eight . " 0
