Who wins the big ones ? Not the glamour boy who does the scoring , but the workhorse who trades elbows ? and sometimes punches ? to get the ball of the backboards . Elgin Baylor of the Los Angeles Lakers had just scored seventy-one points to set a new National Basketball Association scoring record in a game at Madison Square Garden last November , and reporters were clamoring for his reaction . Before answering their questions , however , he had one of his own . " How many rebounds did I get tonight ? " he asked . A rebound is , of course , the recovery of a missed shot taken by any player after it caroms off the backboard . Baylor was informed that he had captured an impressive twenty-five rebounds . In the locker room of his victims , the New York Knickerbockers , Coach Carl Braun came out of shock , muttering , " The guy must 've made a dozen baskets on rebounds of his own shots . " The estimate was only a slight exaggeration . Baylor had scored seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , running over people to grab the ball and put it through the hoop at point-blank range . " There 's the tip-off on his reflexes and body control , " Braun said morosely . " Baylor is only six-five " ? the average height of players in the N.B.A. is six feet , six inches ? " but he 's a seven-footer when he goes up for a rebound . That 's his greatest asset . " Among men who make their living in basketball , rebounding is a fixation that outweighs all other factors in the game . References to it in pregame strategy sound like interminable playbacks of the same phonograph record , and it even supersedes gripes about referees in post-mortems . The yardstick used by the pros in evaluating big men such as Bill Russell , Wilt Chamberlain and Bob Pettit is their effectiveness in " the snake pit , " as the boys call the area under the basket . " Rebounding is to basketball what pitching is to baseball , " Red Auerbach , coach of the Boston Celtics , said recently . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team can be loaded with the best shooters and playmakers in the world , but it wo n't come close to winning without a man who can get the ball for them . Look at my club . We had Cousy , Sharman and Macauley at their peaks , but we did n't win championships until we got Russell to control the backboards . " In the pros we figure each rebound is worth a point . Every team hits an average of about forty per cent on its shots from the field . That means you have eight tenths of a point whenever you get possession of the ball . You pick up the other fraction on fouls the defense commits . " Fred Schaus , whose West Virginia University teams captured six consecutive Southern Conference championships before he switched to coaching the Lakers this season , says that rebounding is just as vital in college basketball . Schaus relates , " I checked the rebounds in 185 games played while I coached West Virginia , and the side with the most rebounds won ninety-two per cent of the games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fans are increasingly aware of re-bounders ' importance . ( Continued on Page 64 ) Many of the fans do n't really comprehend , however , just what the job involves . It is widely assumed that retrieving missed shots is a routine procedure for . excessively tall players . Yet if height were the prime requisite , seven-foot Walter Dukes of Detroit and six-eleven Ray Felix of Los Angeles would be plutocrats instead of ordinary working stiffs . Then there is the case of the towering Syracuse rookie , Swede Halbrook . He stands seven-three  --  two inches taller than Wilt Chamberlain , the leading rebounderbut he is thrown into the arena only for brief spells . Seasoned players almost a head shorter often can outbattle him for the ball in hand-to-hand fights under the baskets . Even unusual agility combined with height is no guarantee of rebounding success . Walt Davis , the 1952 Olympic high-jump champion , was a six-eight bench warmer at Philadelphia and St. Louis for five years . Boston 's Bill Russell ( six-nine ) ca n't lift his carcass as high off the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russell is the Celtics ' rebounding mainstay , while Conley gets to play an average of only about eighteen minutes a game . Sheer strength , an attribute not commonly associated with basketball , is more essential than height when opponents start to shove . sock and throw elbows while jockeying for position under the boards . The action is in considerable contrast to what Dr. James Naismith had in mind when he invented basketball in 1891 . He conceived the game as a non-contact sport . Today the college referees still try to curb roughhouse tactics , but the pros , in bidding for customers , have relaxed the rules until it is debatable whether the big idea is to make points or muscles . Each team in the N.B.A. has two centers who are at least six-eight and weigh from 200 to 255 pounds . The four other men on the court are as hefty as a football backfield . The impact when they collide under the baskets is not as jolting as the body contact in football but , unprotected by padding , basketball pros absorb more cumulative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snake pit last March triggered basketball 's loudest furor since the college-betting of the early 1950 's . Wilt Chamberlain , who had just rewritten the record book in his first season with the Philadelphia Warriors , announced the day after his team was eliminated from the play-offs by the Celtics that he was quitting . He charged that the league had ganged up on him , and accused referees of letting the opposition get away with murder on deliberate fouls to prevent him from scoring . Chamberlain went on to declare that there was n't enough money in the world  --  not even the 540,000 he was estimated to have been paid by the Warriors  --  to induce him to endure such indignities . " If I come back next year and do n't score as many points , I may have to punch eight or nine guys in the face , " he declared . " I may lose my poise . I do n't want to . " A vehement rebuttal came from Bob Cousy , the players ' elder statesman . Observed Cousy , " He feels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The guy averaged thirty-seven points a game , broke the rebound record and was given more foul shots than anybody . How easy does he want it ? Wilt is the biggest complainer ever to hit the N.B.A. I ca n't feel sorry for a man who 's exactly a foot taller than 1 am . " Cynics regarded the Stilt 's retirement threat as a gambit to separate more money from Eddie Gottlieb , the Warriors ' owner . However , there is no question that he was given a strenuous going-over all season . Opponents found that the best defense against his " stuff " shot  --  a maneuver in which he rears up on tiptoes and simply crams the ball through the hoop with both hands  --  was to foul him before he received a pass in scoring position . Chamberlain 's miserable foul shooting made that measure a good calculated risk . He converted only 58 per cent of his free throws , an inept average for a high-school substitute , Cousy and the Celtics particularly resented Chamberlain 's blast because it previously had been implied that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ games to two , by provoking him into a fist fight with Tom Heinsohn in the second contest . Chamberlain suffered a bruised right hand in that game , and it sharply impaired his efficiency in the next two meetings , both won by Boston . He later confessed the hand was hurt slamming the rim of the basket on a rebound . At the time , though , the Warriors hinted darkly of a plot to " get " their star , who averaged forty points a game when his hand was sound and only eighteen points while he was nursing it . If there are repercussions of the incident in March , when the teams probably will meet again for the Eastern Division title , it is unlikely that Chamberlain will be the instigator . Now reconciled to the fact that lumps , welts and abrasions are occupational hazards of a trade that can enrich him beyond the dreams of avarice , Wilt this season has been talking like a realistic businessman . " I made a mistake popping off last year , " he admits . " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the N.B.A. I realize now you 've got to be braced for rough stuff on every move . " He has lost neither his poise nor scoring touch and has not been retaliating overtly against players who keep belting him to curb the raids on the basket . The vigor of his opponents is a tribute to the boys ' bravery and devotion to their work , for they do not relish the prospect of having the 250-pound Chamberlain take a pleasure punch at them . The first thing they invariably mention when discussing the Stilt is his tremendous muscular strength . Veterans who bounced off six-ten , 260-pound George Mikan , and still have the scars to show for it , say Chamberlain is the most powerful physical specimen in the league since the scourge of the old Minneapolis Lakers retired . " Wilt made me a true believer the first five minutes I played against him , " Bill Russell recalls . " Both of us grabbed a loose ball at the same time , and 1 started to yank it away from him . Did you ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's how rigid Wilt 's arms were . Then he began to pull on me . I actually felt my feet leaving the floor . I 'm going to look ultAlly silly , I thought , if he stuffs the ball and me through the basket . Fortunately the referee blew the whistle for a held ball . " Giants who are authentic athletes are making the word " goon " ? in sports , an awkward . overgrown oaf  --  obsolescent in the vocabulary of basketball . Had Chamberlain concentrated on track and field , he might have given Rafer Johnson stiffer contention in the Olympic decathlon at Rome than Formosa 's Yang and Russia 's Kuznetsov . Wilt was a forty-nine-second quarter-miler as a Philadelphia schoolboy , and while at the University of Kansas he high-jumped six-six and threw the shot more than forty-nine feet . The mind boggles at the thought of Stilt 's having a go at the pole vault , but his stamina would run the field ragged in the 1500-meter race . He rarely sits out more than two minutes of a game . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rank gambles as pros until they undergo their indoctrination in the snake pit . Veterans can determine after a few scrimmages in training camp whether a new man will stick or get a one-way ticket home . Says Dolph Schayes of Syracuse , the N.B.A. 's all-time high scorer , " The first thing we do against a rookie on rebounds is to belt him . It 's the same principle as throwing at a batter 's head in baseball . The purpose is not to hurt the man . We want to sec how he responds to a challenge . " If he does n't hit back , you need n't bother to learn his name . He wo n't be around long . If he gets discouraged after retaliating seven or eight times , he 's a borderline player . To make the grade he must keep coming back indefinitely , because that 's how it 's going to be as long as he 's in the league . Literally hundreds of fouls are not called in a game . The only way you can survive and command respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You 've got to scratch for the ball , . t in there any way you can on every , not . " Schayes is a conspicuous example of what he preaches . He never was a gazelle even in his salad days , and he is the only six-eight player in the league who can not leap off the floor high enough to make a dunk shot . Yet he was his team 's top re-bounder last season on sheer aggressiveness . He singles out Elgin Baylor and Bob Pettit as men who come back again and again in the battling under the basket . " Baylor and Pettit are superstars because they wear you out with their terrific drive on rebounds , " he declares . " If Pettit is n't hitting with his jump shot , you can almost hear him say to himself , ' I 've got ta go to the backboards and get my points somehow . ' That 's the difference between an eighteen and a twenty-five-point scoring average . " Early this season in a game against the Knicks , Pettit gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an All-Star ever since he entered the league seven years ago . Pettit normally can give lessons in Southern charm to the headmistress of a fashionable finishing school in Virginia , but he was nervous and irritable as he picked at a steak five hours before game time . Tension was building up in him . The Hawks outclassed the Knicks by a comfortable margin in the first three quarters , but the Knicks kept plugging away before a large home crowd , caught fire and tied the score at I 17-all with forty-nine seconds to go . Pettit screened for Clyde Lovellette on a twenty-foot set shot . The ball rimmed the hoop but Pettit , barging in from his deep position , snagged the rebound and sank it for a goal . He added a free throw for his thirtieth point of the game . The Knicks surged back with a basket , making the score 120-119 . Came the key play . With six seconds left , the Hawks ' Johnny McCarthy was fouled , giving him three chances to make two points and sew up the game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the defense , with two men nearest the basket in the foul lane , gets 95 per cent of the rebounds on free throws . Had the Knicks gained the ball , they would have called a time out immediately and set up a play which , conceivably , could have won the game . More than one decision has been pulled out in the last few seconds . But Pettit came through in the clutch with the one rebound in twenty captured by the offense and preserved the Hawks ' victory . " I take a lot of pride in rebounding , " Pettit told me afterwards . " It sets the tone for my entire game , because it 's largely a matter of desire . The first item I look at in the box score is the rebounds . Ask any big man . " I did ask Chamberlain a few nights after he had broken Bill Russell 's one-game record for rebounds by getting fifty-five . He established the new mark against Russell , of all people , " Pettit gave you the right dope , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prove l could beat Russell off the boards . If I do n't get hopped up for him , I 'll get knocked down I 'd never score a point against Boston if I played the way 1 do against the tailenders . " Chamberlain and Pettit are pile-driving types . From the standpoint of technique , Russell is the acknowledged rebound artist of the N.B.A. His forte is position play  --  getting between the basket and opponents to intercept the ball as it descends . " That 's the basic move , " Russell says , " If a man half a head shorter has position on me , I ca n't get the ball unless foul him . " Although it appears to be an individual feat , rebounding is a co-ordinated team maneuver when executed properly . " Your three big men up front arc supposed to form a cup around the basket and block out their guys , " Red Auerbach explains . " If they do their job , the ball will bounce on the floor and a guard will scoot in and grab it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under game conditions . Things happen so fast somebody generally misses his blocking assignment . and one of the front men has to go for the ball . " Auerbach attaches more importance to rebound blocking than any other coach in the league . Jungle Jim Loscutoff , a mediocre scorer but a formidable muscle man , was practically out for two seasons with leg and back miseries , yet Auerbach carried him on the roster against the day when he would be ready to bowl over people again . Gene Conley , who quit basketball for five years to concentrate on pitching for the Milwaukee Braves , was induced to return by a fat contract in 1958 . Several years ago Auerbach intimated he had discovered a new gimmick on rebounds . Colleagues suspected the secret weapon was Russell , but players traded by the Celtics presently solved the mystery . Auerbach had a formula for anticipating the direction of rebounds off the backboards . This went back to a game Auerbach played with George Washington University against Bradley in 1937 . " We lost by three points , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reputation as a re-bounder against a six-three forward who had five inches on me . Bradley 's star was a hook-shot specialist who heaved the ball from the other side of the court 1 guarded . 1 got six rebounds on the first eight shots he missed . " You did n't have to be a genius to figure that a ball thrown from an angle against a flat surface had to carom off it in the opposite direction . When he hooked from the right . I moved to the left of the basket and parked there for the rebound . The system was not infallible , of course . The ball bounced off the rim back toward Bradley 's star when he was short with a shot but , like most players , he tended to overshoot . Through the years spot checks have shown me that about seventy per cent of all rebounds bounce off the board away from the shooter , twenty per cent kick back to him and ten per cent go up the middle of the court . " Auerbach shrugged . " This would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to situations . A good re-bounder reacts instinctively , like an outfielder judging the flight of a ball the moment it leaves the bat . Cousy has that instinct and so does Cliff Hagan . He 's only six-four , but he seems to get the ball for the Hawks every time you look at him . A lot of big men are washouts as 66 rebounders because their sense of timing is poor . They wait to see whether a shot will be long or short , then they jump too soon or too lute . Let me show you a simple test that drove me crazy while I was getting my master 's in physical education at George Washington . " He rummaged through his pocket for a fairly crisp dollar bill and smoothed it . " Hold your thumb and index finger just far apart enough for the bill to pass through , " he told me . " When I let the dollar go , try to catch it in your fingers . O.K. ? " I gave up after the bill fluttered to the floor on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill once in fifty attempts , " Auerbach commented . " A fellow like Russell will nab it maybe a dozen times . Most of us see the dollar fall , then react . Russell sees and reacts simultaneously . That 's what makes him a great rebounder . " Russell has a graphic description for his technique . " 1 go for the ball as though it 's a balloon about to break , " he says . " I try to grab it as fast as possible , then get rid of it as though it 's a time bomb . " Before Russell came along , gaining possession of the ball was the primary objective of backboard men . They looked like predatory birds as they hauled down defensive rebounds  --  that is , balls taken off the basket they guarded . Their legs and arms flailed the air to beat off opponents , and upon descending they dribbled ponderously to the side before passing the ball . Russell , on the other hand , fires it to Cousy while he is high off the floor to trigger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the game . Every big man tries to imitate Russell 's style now , but he still holds the copyright . On offensive rebounds off his own goal , a man does a good job when he simply bats the ball in the air and deflects it from an opponent who has position on him . If no one blocks him , he can dunk the ball for an easy two-pointer , of course , but even Chamberlain rarely picks up more than one gift goal a game . Incidentally , players admit that most tip-insrebounds knocked into the hoop by random swipes  --  are pure luck . Notable exceptions are Pettit , Baylor and Heinsohn , whose delicate fingertip control virtually makes their tip-ins modified jump shots . In any candid discussion of rebounding technique it must be admitted that a stiff poke in the ribs when the referee is n't looking is a splendid substitute for such refinements as speed , timing and finesse . If the N.B.A. officials called every foul that is committed on rebounds , the game would degenerate into little more than a free-throw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are bunched in the forecourt , it is standard procedure for all players to lash out with their arms as soon as a shot goes up . Every man tries to knock his opposite number off balance and get the jump of a step on him in following up the rebound . The heroes resort to all sorts of trade tricks . A little stunt known as " climbing the monkey 's back " is pulled constantly under the basket . A player blocked out leaps and pushes down on the shoulder of the man in front of him , thereby getting an extra boost and grounding the other fellow . Other old chestnuts are tugging at a man 's pants to check his momentum or locking his arm to prevent him from jumping . Fans frequently see the curious spectacle of one big hulk trying to hold hands with another , after the manner of an ardent swain pressing his attentions on a shy girl . The unwilling party is struggling to escape the clutches of a defensive man . T H E Russell used me as a patsy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He stationed me four feet in front of the basket and stood directly behind me with his chin resting on my head . " The ball is coming off the board , " he said . " Go up for it , " I started to jump and was propelled off the court by a nudge in the seat of the pants . " I did n't do anything ! " Russell cried in mock protest , " You fouled me by hitting my knee with your butt . " He grinned . " You have to squat when you jump from a standing position . When you crouched you made contact with my knee and knocked yourself out of position to get the ball . " An unwritten law has been adopted by the pros to limit assault and battery on rebounds . " The worst damage is done by the elbow , " Alex Hannum , the Syracuse coach , explains . " It 's as dangerous as a blackjack when a player lashes out with it . There 's a general understanding that a man must keep his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position . He can push and jab with his hands , but as long as his elbows are locked at his side he ca n't hurt anyone seriously . When a fight breaks out , the trouble almost always can be traced to an elbow somebody threw under the basket . " Although pro teams constantly are on the prowl for prospects with the height and heft for rebounding , the only new men to establish themselves at this specialty in the past four years are Chamberlain , Baylor and Detroit 's Bailey Howell . Finding good rebounders among the scores of college stars who come up every year is getting increasingly difficult . Rookies are tripped by a psychological hurdle that is as imposing as the physical demands of the snake pit . A kid who has towered over everyone throughout his career discovers that all the teams he faces have two or three men his size  --  often bigger and stronger . Bill Russell , who has a whimsical sense of humor , laughs now at the anguish he encountered in his debut with the Celtics in 1956 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Australia where I was a big star . I had it made , man . All-America in college for two years . A contract as fat as my scrapbook . My first game , against St. Louis . was on a national TV network . " Charley Share , who was six-eleven and weighed'about two-fifty played center for St. Louis , and he should 've been arrested S A D A Y EVP.NINI1 POST for the way he manhandled me . Every time I got set for a rebound , Shure shoved me off the court like a bulldozer . Between the halves I asked Arnie Risen , a veteran , how to stop Share from pushing me around . ' Push him first , ' Risen told me . ' Lean on him . ' So I went back all fired up , and I leaned on Share . " At this point Russell goes to the nearest wall and slides his feet out along the floor until his body is at a forty-five-degree angle . " This is how 1 wound up leaning on Share , and I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legendary him Original Celtics , was reminiscing recently about the trends that have revolutionized the game in the last forty years . He is thoroughly familiar with the situation , having coached the Knicks for nine years between stints at St. John 's of Brooklyn , where he is now . " Two developments would have murdered the old Celtics , if we played the same way against even a second-rate college team today , " Lapchick said . " The shooting and the rebounding . Everybody is making fantastic one-handed jump shots now . High-school kids are hitting on shots Nat Holman and Davey Banks never dreamed of attempting the best day they ever saw . But it 's an aptitude that can be acquired . The rebounding is an entirely different matter . There are so few outstanding backboard men that you 've got to recognize it as the most difficult skill . " We never went through the motions of rebounding in my time . I was considered a monster at six-five , but I did n't attempt to get the ball off my own board . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The first man who fought for the ball at both ends of the court was Tarzan Cooper , who played with the Renaissance Big Five , the forerunner of the Harlem Globetrotters . He gave me fits . But both of us were flatfooted clowns compared to some of the backboard men today . " Lapchick reflected for a moment . " All of us in the coaching business try to impress people by talking about basketball as though it 's a complicated game . But in the final minutes of a squeaker , when all hell is busting loose , what are the masterminds doing to win it ? We 're yelling , ' Get the ball , ' just like everybody in the joint . " What else is there to say ? That 's the whole ball game . "
