TURPIN by Stephen Jones . 307 pages . Macmillan . $5.95 . <P> <P> " I wanted to leave , but felt like a man on a crowded escalator waiting for the right step to get off , afraid to reveal his panic to the other shoppers by bolting too soon and the whole time crushed by visions of what would happen when he shreds under , riser and tread , all his ribbon and wrapping adangle down the dark side of the moon . " This is Turpin-college graduate , widower , veterinarian , and part-time lobster fisherman-forging flinchingly ahead in three days of misadventure that resembles a manic sleepwalker 's nightmare . <P> Arriving at Turpin 's home in a storm , Mandeville , an obvious drunkard and possible psychotic , demands that Turpin circumcise Mandeville 's golden retriever . The subsequent brutal murder of the dog is but the beginning of a series of bizarre deaths in which Turpin naturally becomes entrapped . Verbally shanghaied aboard an expensive yacht , Turpin finds himself in Raceport , Long Island , where he grapples with a girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gum . Nelson Falorp , wealthy owner of the yacht , has a heart attack in the bathroom of a wharf restaurant , and Turpin becomes responsible for his unwanted corpse . Elsie Falorp jumps out the window of a hotel on Gull Island where Mandeville , Turpin and her husband 's body have all been accidentally flown and deserted by the drunken pilot . <P> Wildly improbable as these goings-on may be , Novelist Stephen Jones has a gift for sweet and savage satire reminiscent of that unwholesome trio : Nikolai Gogol , Nathanael West and Samuel Beckett . His characters parody themselves in obsessive dead-end conversations , groping their way circularly past each other through muddled clouds of private thought and uncertain motive . In this first novel , his descriptions of hotels , restaurants , odd corners of small towns and the seedy people who inhabit them , haunt the mind 's eye . Yet Jones ' real talent is for making the improbable seem necessary and the grotesque plausibly humdrum . Perhaps because Jones has caught lobsters , sold boats , worked on newspapers and taught school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just below the surface of apparently calm minds seems somehow fresh-and far removed from the structural , Stygian , self-conscious atrocities of the black comedians with whom he will inevitably be compared . <P> About lobsters , Turpin observes : " As Nerval says , They know the secrets of the sea and do not bark . ' " Stephen Jones knows the secrets of the land and roars with laughter .
