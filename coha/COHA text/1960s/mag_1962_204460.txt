Moving to aid the most overregulated of major U.S. industries , John F. Kennedy last week wrote a heady new prescription for the nation 's trains , planes , buses and barges . The prescription : less Goverment control , more competitive freedom . <P> In the most ambitious message on transportation that any President has addressed to Congress , Kennedy proposed an entire complex of fresh laws to replace " a chaotic patchwork of inconsistent and often obsolete legislation . " The President sought to spur the U.S. Government into a coherent and long-overdue adjustment to the changing economic facts of life in the transportation business . <P> Bail for Rails . A central problem is that the U.S. simply has too much transportation capacity . Last year the nation 's airlines used only 57% of their total seat capacity , ran $34 million in the red . The big Eastern railroads lost $96 million . But federal , state and even local regulators have stubbornly continued to foster uneconomic competition by artificial means . <P> They have often refused to permit the carriers to merge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gouged the railroads outrageously with discriminatory taxation . <P> Most of the punitive regulation was written in the days when the railroads were bad and fat , and was deliberately designed to pare them down to size . But the railroads no longer hold their old , arrogant monopoly over the nation 's transport . Recognizing this , the President 's program would help the hard-pressed railroads most of all , and do some damage to their less heavily regulated competitors-notably the barge lines and truckers . Kennedy 's key proposals : FREIGHT RATES . The ICC could no longer set minimum rates , only maximum rates . At present , the commission firmly fixes all railroad freight rates , while allowing truckers to set their own rates for farm goods and permitting barge operators to charge what they want for bulk commodities such as grain , ore , oil and coal . <P> Under the Kennedy plan , all carriers , including the railroads , could cut rates as low as they wished , though not below their actual costs of operation in cases where such cuts were aimed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have long argued that they would be much more competitive if they were permitted to reduce their rates for bulk goods-which now account for 70% of all railroad tonnage and 90% of the tonnage carried on waterways . <P> PASSENGER RATES . To stimulate travel , the railroads , airlines and buses would be allowed to reduce passenger rates at will . This would permit selective reductions , such as the recent plan proposed by Continental Air Lines-and rejected by the CAB-to create a new " economy " class of domestic air fares . <P> TAXES . The 10% tax on rail and bus tickets would be eliminated ; on plane tickets , it would be halved to 5% . The Government would impose new taxes of 2 per gallon on jet fuel and barge fuel , which would help to defray the Government 's costs of dredging waterways , building airports and running the air lanes-and also help to quiet the railroaders ' complaints that their competitors enjoy many indirect subsidies . Direct subsidies to the nation 's small " feeder " airlines , now amounting to $68 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
