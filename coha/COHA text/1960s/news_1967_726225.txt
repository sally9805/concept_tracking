txt A strong movement has developed in the Senate for repeal of the Presidential campaign financing law that Congress enacted last fall . The issue is expected to be settled within a few days after Congress returns April 3 from a 10-day Easter recess . The outcome is in doubt . The leader of the movement , Senator Albert Gore , Democrat of Tennessee , expressed confidence in an interview yesterday that the disputed law would be repealed . " I have n't done any nose count but sentiment in the Senate is pretty strong against it now , " he said . " Public reaction has been quite unfavorable . " Option for Taxpayer As the law now stands , taxpayers would have the opportunity in 1968 and subsequent years to check a box on their individual income tax returns if they wanted $1 of their taxes to go into a Presidential campaign fund . Up to $30-million could be paid from the fund to each of the major political parties for the Presidential campaign of 1968 . The financing plan , devised by Senator Russell B. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senate shortly before the 89th Congress adjourned last October . The proposal was nri extraneous amendment to a tax revision bill designed to encourage foreign investment in the United States . The vote was 39 to 33 . With President Johnson 's endorsement , the amendment was retained in the final text adopted by the House and Senate . Senator Gore , whose opposition to the plan delayed adjournment for a day , said he would use another tax measure ? an Administration bill to restore tax benefits for business investment in equipment and // buildings  --  as a springboard for renewal of the fight . When the House-approved bill is called up for debate on April 3 , he said , he will offer an amendment to repeal the campaign financing law . The amendment is co-sponsored by Senator John J. Williams , Republican of Delaware . " If this campaign subsidy law should become operative , " Senator Gore maintained , " it would compound the evils that now flow from loose and questionable campaign ' financing procedures and would likely doom future efforts to enact realistic clean-elections legislation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realized " when Congress approved the device " in haste " last fall , he said . " There are no restrictions whatever on the purposes , for which the Money may be spent , " he said . " There are no safeguards against corrupt practices . The entire amount could be spent in a few states or even in one state . " Moreover , the parties will continue to be limited only by their ingenuity with respect to the raising and spending of campaign funds from private sources . " Senator Gore suggested that provisions for financing campaigns with public funds " under adequate safeguards " might be written into election reform legislation once the Long plan was repealed . " The nation badly needs a comprehensive overhaul of our existing unrealistic and ineffective laws regulating campaign contributions and expenditures in Federal elections , " he said . " But if the subsidy is made available before the basic reform is enacted , we shall simply never achieve reform . " ' Senator Long was in Louisiana for the Easter recess , and efforts to reach him by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counter Mr. Gore 's move with a promise of hearings by the Senate Finance Committee , of which he is chairman , on proposals for modification as well as repeal of the financing law . Aides disclosed earlier this year that they had prepared a number of amendments to the law at Senator Long 's request . They said he was considering the advisability of a completely different approach but was reluctant to abandon the checkoff system without a trial . One possible alternative would be to authorize the appropriation of campaign money from the Treasury without any checkoff by taxpayers . In any case , one of the Long those polling more than 15 million votes . A minor party would be eligible for a smaller share , but only if it polled more than five million votes in the most recent Presidential election . None has done that well in 40 years . The amount available for distribution to major parties is based on the combined vote cast in the most recent election for their Presidential candidates . For each vote above 10 million , $1 is allotted for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 70 million votes were cast in the 1964 election for the Democratic and Republican candidates . Thus , $60-million would be available to the two major parties in 1968 if the fund contained that much . Each party would get $30-million , if it spent that much , to cover campaign costs certified by the Controller General . If a minor party candidate should poll as many as five million votes in 1968 or some future Presidential election , the party would be entitled to a share of the fund in the following Presidential election year . The minor party would receive $1 for each vote over five million polled by its candidate . When the business investment tax bill was considered by the Finance Committee the week before last , . Senator Gore offered his repeal amendment but then withdrew it out of courtesy to Senator Long , who was absent . Committee members said a majority of the committee apparently was ready to adopt it at the time . it to passage by the end of the week of April 3 . The first post-Easter measure on the House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copyright laws . The House Ways and Means Committee plans to complete hearings April 6 on the Administration bill to raise benefits and otherwise liberalize the Social Security program . The measure still faces exhaustive examination and some probable changes in closed committee sessions that are likely to continue through much of May and perhaps longer . While the legislative pace of Congress may be gradually stepped up after the recess , some of the most controversial issues are unlikely to be disposed of before July or August . President Johnson has not indicated whether he will press his request for a 6 per cent surcharge on individual and corporate income taxes . The Ways and Means Committee , in any case , does not plan to consider it within the next two months . There are strong indications that the Administration 's civil rights bill will not be approved at this session . The outlook for adoption of some other legislation , including wiretap control andi firearms regulation , is equally dim . amendments is likely to call for the prohibition or sharp limitation of private contributions to Presidential campaigns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be sure , " one of them remarked , " that he will make a strong case against outright repeal at this time . " Senator Long contended last fall that his financing plan would " do more than anything done in the last 100 years to take improper influence out of Government . " Its ultimate purpose , he said , is to relieve the major political parties of the need for campaign contributions from other sources . Major political parties , under the Long financing law , are entitled to draw equal shares of the checkoff fund to cover certified Presidential campaign expenses every four years . Major parties are defined as Last year , the committee ap-1 proved the Long plan as an amendment to the foreign investment tax bill by a vote of 12 to 5 . Meanwhile , Congress , after returning from its Easter vacation , is expected to enact restoration of the business tax incentives , which were suspended last fall to restrain inflationary pressures that have now abated , as its first major legislation to be sent to President Johnson .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
