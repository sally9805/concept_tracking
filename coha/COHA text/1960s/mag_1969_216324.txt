When summoned to Pablo Picasso 's Riviera villa last March , Paris Printer Aldo Crommelynck packed only one clean shirt . There had been many previous summonses in the 20 years that Crommelynck , 37 , and his brother Piero , 34 , had been privileged to print the master 's occasional engravings . The brothers even found it worthwhile to keep a small printing press in an atelier near Picasso 's house , enabling the impatient artist to view proofs without delay . From those earlier calls , Crommelynck fully expected to run off proofs of one or possibly two new engravings-all Picasso ever seemed to produce at a time-and be on his way back to Paris in a day or two at most . <P> It never did pay to take Picasso for granted . <P> Crommelynck found that the 87-year-old Picasso had launched into a fury of sustained creativity , turning out etchings-and nothing else-at the astonishing rate of almost two a day . The printer resignedly settled into a state of semi-residence as the artist worked on and on , from March into early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject to which Picasso addressed himself . At a time of life when sex is little more than a dim memory for most men , he was lustily scratching out on copper one erotic scene after another , never hesitating to boldly gouge a representation of himself into the action . Not once did he summon a model-his incredible visual memory or imagination seemed capable of producing any variant of pose or coupled posture . <P> Two Kinds of Women . The engravings , as usual fully subscribed in advance in editions of 50 each , have been assembled into an exhibit titled simply " 347 Gravures " and mounted simultaneously in Paris and Chicago ; the show is just finishing a six-week run at the Galerie Louise Leiris , but by popular demand The Art Institute of Chicago has extended it for another month . The engravings represent what may well be the most exhaustive study of genitals , mainly female , ever seen in legitimate art galleries . Says his longtime dealer and friend , Daniel-Henry Kahn-weiler : " His work has always been profoundly autobiographical . Women play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject of this show is himself , his imagination , his dreams . " As the artist once said , " for me , there are two kinds of women-goddesses and doormats . " Both are clearly visible . <P> One of Picasso 's themes , that of artist and model , is omnipresent . In one engraving after another , men representing painters-or voyeurs-stare at shamelessly naked women ; occasionally they indulge in intercourse with their ever-compliant models , palette and brushes still in hand . Reflecting the artist 's Spanish heritage , a whole series of moody prints shows grandees on horseback abducting maidens . Satyrs abound . <P> Stylistically , Picasso runs the gamut from the murky chiaroscuro of Rembrandt to a spidery line that Steinberg could be proud of . Technically , the prints are a virtuoso performance in which the artist often combines various techniques-etching , aquatint , drypoint-on the same plate .
