The 41-year-old woman in Pontiac General Hospital was anemic and needed blood transfusions to build her up for an operation . From the refrigerator , doctors took a pint of matching ( Group A , Rh-positive ) blood that had been stored for 19 days and transfused it into one of her veins . By the next day her blood counts were somewhat better , but to be on the safe side , the doctors gave her the concentrated cells from another pint of blood from the same donor . <P> <P> What made this otherwise routine case remarkable was that the donor was a dead boy of twelve , who had drowned in a nearby lake . After all attempts to revive him had failed , Pathologists Jack Kevorkian and Glenn W. Bylsma did an autopsy and withdrew two pints from a jugular vein . This was 2 to 3 hours after death . To make sure that no germs had got into the blood ( which would make it unsafe for transfusion ) , samples were incubated for two weeks . The woman patient had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now well and at home . <P> Pathological Prejudice . This was the fourth time that Drs . Kevorkian and Bylsma had supplied cadaver blood for transfusion . In three previous cases the attending physicians tried it cautiously , and only on incurable patients . Yet using cadaver blood is not a new practice . At Moscow 's Sklifosovsky Institute , almost 30 tons of it have been given in 30,000 transfusions since the method was first tried there in 1930 . U.S. doctors have shied away from it because of prejudice against contact with anything taken from a corpse . The Pontiac pathologists hoped that this prejudice was weakening with wider acceptance of corneal grafting and the transplanting of bone and arteries from accident victims . <P> Use of cadaver blood offers several advantages . A living donor may lie about his health , especially about such a vital question as whether he has had hepatitis . Moreover , he can not comfortably give more than a pint every two or three months . The corpse can not lie , and the pathologists doing an autopsy can check every vital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They select as donors only the corpses of presumably healthy individuals who die suddenly , as in traffic accidents or from heart attacks . A cadaver yields far more blood than a walking donor : the Pontiac investigators have drawn as many as three pints from a grown man ; the Russians say they get as many as eight pints . <P> Safety Rules . Drs . Kevorkian and Bylsma thought that they were applying the Russian method for the first time in the U.S. Then they learned , from a recent Bulletin of the American Association of Blood Banks , that as long ago as 1935 Surgeon Leonard L. Charpier had used a similar technique in a Chicago suburb . Dr. Charpier kept the work secret and died without writing up his records . But he was responsible for about 35 cadaver-blood transfusions in two years . Then the modern system of blood banking , which permits blood to be stored for three weeks without deterioration , was developed . <P> A few strict rules must be followed in using cadaver blood . It must be drawn within six hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a complete autopsy must be done . When these conditions are met , say the Pontiac doctors in Clinical Pathology , " we know it can do no harm and that it offers tremendous potential good . "
