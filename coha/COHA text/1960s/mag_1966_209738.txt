Most dictators find a certain cruel pleasure in the judicious balance of bread and circuses necessary to keep their people in hand . In Cuba , where nearly everything is rationed , Castro has only half the fun . But when circus time arrives , Fidel makes the most of it , as he did last week on a double occasion for revelry-the seventh anniversary of his rise to power and the convening of the first " anti-imperialist " conference of Latin American , African and Asian nations . <P> For days in advance , workers were painting Havana 's threadbare buildings , draping banners , and hanging enormous murals depicting Brobdingnagian revolutionaries . The festivities began with a New Year 's blast in the Plaza de la Revolucin , where 50,000 Cubans and guests paid $3 a head for a spread of roast pig and chicken , and toasted the year with hundreds of gallons of Spanish wine . <P> Something Unseen . The exultant climax came two days later when 500,000 cheering Cubans crowded into the Plaza to watch Latin America 's biggest military machine pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cuba 's other commissars . While MIGs screamed overhead , Fidel 's Communist-trained troops , cadets and members of the civilian Popular Defense Force clicked smartly past , followed by armored troop carriers , tanks , rocket launchers and a flock of missiles . " There is something else that is not seen , " Castro told the crowd jubilantly , " and that is many weapons more . The quantity has grown . " <P> Castro could not say as much for rice , the staple of every Cuban meal . Mournfully , he disclosed that Red China had broken a $250 million barter agreement-mostly Chinese rice for Cuban sugar . China blamed economic pressures at home , but there was little doubt that Castro 's drift toward Moscow was the real reason . " I thought this was a long-term proposition , " Castro said , " but the other party did not understand it that way . " As a result , the Cuban rice ration was lopped in half-from 6 lbs . a month per person to 3 lbs . Oh , well , shrugged Fidel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , vitamins , minerals and energy , " which was not much consolation to a populace that has always based its meals on Moros y Cristianos ( Moors and Christians ) , as many Cubans fondly call their staple beans and rice . <P> Third World Force . The subject of rice probably never came up before the well-fed delegates at the nine-day Tri-Continental Conference , which drew 505 delegates from 85 countries to Havana 's Hotel Libre . They had enough ideology to chew on , what with Peking 's delegates bickering with the Russians and Moscow 's men biting right back . Castro himself was all unity . <P> As many a tinhorn ruler had done before him , Fidel apparently hopes to form a third world force of small , revolutionary countries , and Havana Radio hinted that it should be represented by a new tri-continental organization with headquarters in Havana . To Cubans , that sounded like circus time forever .
