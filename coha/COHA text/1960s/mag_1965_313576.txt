To those who treasure taste , Louis is the label for some of the world 's greatest antiques . France 's Louis XVI lent his name to a revival of Greco-Roman dcor . Louis XV ruled in a time when furniture makers shunned the straight line , and Louis XIV , the Sun King , is still a synonym for sumptuousness . Now antiques addicts are turning back to an even earlier Louis-the 13th-whose style furnished France when it was becoming the first great nation in Europe . <P> Louis XIII furniture is much like the King 's rule : cosmopolitan , craftsman-like and built for the ages . The second of the Bourbons , he ruled from 1610 to 1643 ( a reign that roughly parallels England 's Early Jacobean period ) , generated the power that elevated France into the splendor of the baroque . It was a period that saw both the dissolving of the parlements and the founding of the Acadmic Franaise . <P> Pulpit Bar .

But no longer , for a revival of Louis XIII antiques has tripled their prices in the past five years ; they are now the freshest item on the French market . Scarce , perhaps , but a perfect Treize chair runs to $2,000 , compared with the $5,500 that a great Quinze plotzer costs . Original gateleg tables cost little more than Swedish modern . <P> Louis XIII furniture is dark , heavy and austere , and as such has much in common with massive Spanish cabinetry , which is also coming back into vogue . Both mix well with the trim structural look of modern furnishings .

" As different a type as Novelist James Jones also has decorated his Paris duplex with Louis XIII . " Yeah , I just like old medieval furniture , " he says .

Louis XIII furniture was modern in its day ; it marked the point when hand-carved Renaissance woodwork gave way to all the sensuous , symmetrical turnings that a cabinet-maker 's lathe could serve up . Finials , banderoles , and swags of fruit and flowers appeared , to give essentially stiff , straight-backed woodwork an animate touch . Table and chair legs ceased to butt into the floor , instead rested on gentler bun feet , but H-form stretchers low to the floor held the frames rigidly intact .
