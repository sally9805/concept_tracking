In the early 1960 's some still do so . Ancient Navies Fought With Galleys But it was Greeks and Romans who carried the development of the ship forward , for both war and peace . The Greeks developed the war , alley , a long , fast vessel manned by oarsmen , who were the " engines " in quiet Mediterranean seas ? the more oars , the more powerful the ship . The Phoenicians were using double-banked galleys ( biremes ) for inshore work by 700 B.C. , and the Greeks had triple-bankers ? triremes ? not long afterward , with outriggers to accommodate the third bank of oarsmen . Such vessels were exclusively fighting ships , with underwater rams on strengthened bows and light upper decks for the fighting men . Not designed for long voyages , they were usually hauled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and slept . In battle the galleys rowed full speed at one another , trying first to ram and then to board . Soldiers hurled stones and javelins and sought to close with spears and swords . Before long they were using what they called " engines , " too ? missile launchers that used sprung wooden levers held back with twisted ropes to lob large rocks or fire oversize arrows upon enemy decks . These fighting galleys must have been fantastic vessels . They must have made a brave sight , rowing along in the blue Mediterranean among the fabulous Greek islands , oar blades flashing wet in the golden sunshine , spray curling white above the powerful rams , or with large single sails ( often in beautiful colors ) swelling in the soft , warm breeze . Persia Assembled 1,000 Galleys They were known as long ships to distinguish them from the slow-sailing cargo carriers called round ships ( following pages ) . At any of the great Mediterranean battles between 600 and 200 B.C. , rival long ships covered the sea by hundreds . During its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 1,000 galleys , which fought at the Battle of Salamis ; their crews numbered some 200,000 . Inventories of the Athenian dockyard still exist , inscribed on stone slabs later used as lining for drains . These , dating some 300 years before Christ was born , give exact details of the gear issued to each ship and exact figures for the ships in service . The oarsmen were recruited by rich citizens responsible for providing and manning such ships of war . The richer the citizen , the larger the number of- galleys he might provide . Fair enough , since war galleys existed for the protection of the state . The ancient round ship developed into a short , fat merchantman , a wooden vessel with a deck and two masts . The shorter mast , leaning forward , stood up from the bows . It was more like a high-angled bowsprit and it car-@# Two Banks of Oars Propel a Bireme Past a Beamy Roman Merchantman Battleship of its day , the bireme suggests a centipede striding across the sea .

Pictures of them appear on the famous Bayeux Tapestry ( pages 506-7 ) . Seals from French , German , and English ports show similar one-masted sailers . Development of the stern rudder and the deep-draught hull improved sailing qualities . In such rough places as the North Sea , the Bay of Biscay , and the Atlantic off Portugal , oars would not do as a reliable means of propulsion . Calms were usually of short duration . There was plenty of wind . If ships wanted to get anywhere , they had to sail . And so hulls deepened , masts were strengthened and made more rigid , rigging was added to support the mast from sideways stresses in beam winds . Fore- and aftercastles grew . Sailors lived forward , officers aft . This was a natural outcome since it was from aft the ship was worked . The rudder and tiller were there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or poop , was also farthest from the stinking bilge water that swirled in the ship 's belly . It was the logical place of command and was readily defended . When fighting was to be done , knights and soldiers were embarked . The knights hung their shields , emblazoned with their arms , around the aftercastle and camped and fought from there . It was like a castle 's keep . Large platforms , big enough for eight or ten archers , were built at the masthead . Such big platforms , called tops , lasted a long time . You can see them aboard U.S.S. Constitution in the U. S. Naval Shipyard at Boston , or at the lower mastheads of Mayflower II at Plymouth , Massachusetts . These one-masted ships carried English Crusaders to the Mediterranean . There were many one-masters in that sea , too , but they were usually not square-riggers . The northerners liked one big square sail on a rigidly supported mast . The southerners used numer- 510 ous ships rigged with the lateen sail ? a large triangular sail set from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mast . Both rigs had their advantages , but the development of the strongly built north European ship from one to three masts in the 15th century made her pre-eminent . The single mast was stepped slightly forward of the ship 's center . There was room ahead of and behind it for other masts . Bright shipowners added a foremast , with another smaller sail , as the Chinese had done in Asian waters centuries earlier . The high-angled bowsprit , with its spritsail , followed . Then they needed something aft to balance the ship ; so they added a small mast with a lateen sail , or , later , perhaps a single square sail set from a crossed yard . sail set from a crossed yard . Thus , the full-rigged ship arrived . In an improved form she is still with us , after 800 years , but in ever diminishing numbers ; there are only a few school ships now .

Coasting might suffice for long Asian vov -- ages , but the European had to find his way across the trackless sea . If Europe 's seamen had been restricted to coasting , America might still be undiscovered ! The advance of the science of transoceanic navigation was a slow , cumulative process . Chinese pilots had the compass a thousand years ago . With it a pilot might strike out for short passages across the open sea , if he knew where he was going and knew the coasts at the other end . This the Asians did on their monsoonal voyages . When I sailed in a Persian Gulf dhow in 1938-39 on an 8,000-mile voyage that lasted eight months , we were out of sight of land only one day , and the captain-pilot knew every headland , every feature of the coasts of all Arabia and of East Africa as far south as Mozambique .

At the Battle of Lepanto in 1571 , when the Turks were decisively beaten in one of the most famous naval encounters in history , the combined fleets of Spain , Italian city-states , Sicily , Malta , and the Pope numbered more than 200 large galleys , and the Turks had more . After Lepanto , when oared fighting ships began to disappear from the Mediterranean , both Sweden and Russia introduced them into the Baltic , where rocks and shoals imperiled the pure sailing craft . At first these Baltic vessels were galleys , but they soon became small sailing ships , resembling more the northern square-rigger than the Mediterranean galley . Their auxiliary power was usually 18 to 20-odd pairs of long oars worked from the gun deck . Such ships were built in the Baltic as late as 1809 .

Drake 's circumnavigation demonstrated seaworthiness and seamanship as never before . By the end of the 16th century European sailing ships could go anywhere there was water to float them . Merchantmen developed lower hulls and greater cargo capacity . They still had to be prepared to fight , but with the introduction of gunports cut into their hulls , naval ships could battle each other anywhere at sea . Warships went down the ways beautified like pampered queens ? their upper gunports ringed with gracious carving , their aftercastles carved and windowed .

During peaceful periods they may have ig sh spent most of their time in port but , once war heels began , they had to be able to keep the sea it ri for long periods . Men such as Pett were helped by the enterprising and able Samuel Pepys , the famous diarist who served for years as secretary of the Admiralty of England ( page 516 ) . After Pett and Pepys , warships remained much the same for 200 years . Great monopolies in merchant shipping , such as the East India Company , were good for profits , but they froze merchant ship development .

The old " wooden walls " were finished by the mid-19th century , but the big sailing merchantman lasted another 100 years . Here the American contribution was immense and magnificent . In Europe development was often held back by undue conservatism . In the United States after the Revolution , man was free . So was enterprise . Privateers Win China Trade There was no American Navy when the Revolutionary War began , so privateers were used .

By 1785 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Cape of Good Hope to Mauritius and on to China , making wonderful profits from her enterprise and sailing skill . Before long , American ships had won a practical monopoly of the China trade . The Grand Turk 's owner , Elias Hasket Derby of Salem , is rated as one of America 's first millionaires . He sent ships wherever he could find trade ? to India , Java , China , Mauritius , the Philippines . They were small ships and their cargoes were minute , by later standards . But the teas , spices , and so forth which they carried brought high prices in a rich and growing market . The little ships paid well . Fast ships were needed for such Yankee enterprise . The Baltimore clipper brigs and schooners led the way . Know-how in tough ocean sailing , gained from the splendid square-riggers of the North Atlantic passenger trade , led to the development of the big clipper ships .

Storming out to Australia from England , full of emigrants and cargo , or fighting the savage , ceaseless gales off fierce Cape Horn , California-bound for gold , the swift , lean , racing clippers were glorious , unrivaled , almost incredible . Theirs was the most marvelous era the sea had ever known , and they were unquestionably the most wonderful ships . Outstanding among the clipper builders was Donald McKay , born in Nova Scotia , of Scots descent , New Englander by adoption . He designed and built a succession of beautiful and highly successful ships whose names are still household words . His glorious Lightning streaked like lightning across the seaways of the world . His Champion of the Seas was just that , and his beautiful Flying Cloud flew like a white cloud of grace and strength and beauty over the sea as ships had never done before .

But only a dozen big schooners , all Portuguese and mostly built of steel , fish the Grand Banks today .

Rex , Germany 's Bremen , Cunard 's Queens . Sailing whalers like the Charles W. Mor- 543  |p544  gan have become 20,000-ton factory ships , specialized tankers with ' tweendecks full of machinery and modern tryworks , and ramps cut in their sterns through which 90-ton whales are hauled bodily aboard . The diesel engine and fuel oil , instead of coal , give greater flexibility and tremendous range . A fifth of the world 's merchant ships today are tankers of one sort and another . And Now Nuclear Power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outwardly , but her power plant could revolutionize the economy of the sea . Launched at Camden , New Jersey , in July , 1959 , the new Savannah ? 595 feet long and able to carry 9,500 tons at better than 20 knots ? was part of President Eisenhower 's " Atoms-for-Peace " program . Early in 1962 , the Savannah ran successful trials under nuclear power . Even earlier , atomic-powered submarines were able to circumnavigate the globe under water at phenomenal speeds. * So man continues to strive toward better , safer , larger , more economical ships ? with the gas-turbine engine , the nuclear plant , the crewless ship run by automation . We still , however , have to come up with the ocean-going jet-propelled ship ? a good idea patented by an English inventor , John Allen , in 1729 . His craft was to make headway " by forcing water through the stern or hinder part , at a convenient distance under the surface of the water , into the sea , by means of proper engines placed within the ships . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea , under the sea , over the sea . We have the skim-dish called the hovercraft , a sort of cross between an aircraft and a ship , which propels itself upon a cushion of air , racing over the water at 50 knots and floating up over the sand to land its passengers on the beach ; the experimental dracone , a seagoing " sausage " of neoprene-coated nylon to be towed with its cargo of oil or other liquids ; the Grumman hydrofoil ship Denison , which can cruise at 60 knots . So ships come ? all shapes , all sizes , some ( to a seaman ) very odd indeed , but all in direct line of man 's endless endeavor to perfect his means of communication by sea , to control the sea as his great highway . We have come a mighty long way , but the quest for perfection is not ended yet .
