<P> " They just do n't understand , " said Novelist Truman Capote , not deigning to identify " they . " " This is purely and simply a party for my friends . " The trouble was that no one could quite believe that Truman 's 540 most intimate friends could be composed of the likes of Averell Harriman and Sammy Davis Jr. , Walter Lippmann and Frankie Sinatra , William Baldwin , James Baldwin , Tallulah Bankhead and the Marquis and Marchioness of Dufferin and Ava . Yet the fact is that he possesses an almost endless entre into the world of the great and the glamorous ; as he modestly puts it : " I have an awful lot of friends all over the world . " <P> When in London , he puts up with U.S. Ambassador David K. E. Bruce ; in Manhattan he lunches at the St. Regis with " Babe " Paley , wife of the CBS board chairman . And when time comes to cruise the Greek isles , he goes shipmate with Gianni and Marella Agnelli , Prince Adolfo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Washington Post . <P> A Mess of Piranhas . Capote 's friends are nothing if not loyal-in fact , some of them feel he has changed their lives forever by opening new vistas . When his latest book came out , Kay Graham threw a big party for him in Washington and he promised her last spring , " I 'm going to give a party for you because you gave one for me . " The place would just have to be the Plaza Hotel , " because it has the only truly beautiful ballroom left in New York . " And the decor would be straight out of Cecil Beaton 's Ascot scene in My Fair Lady ; everyone must come in black and white . <P> Most fun of all for Capote , who has played at giving fantasy parties since childhood , was to decree that everyone should wear a mask . The whole point of a bal masqu , he explained , " is to ask anyone you want to dance and sit wherever you want , and then , when the masks come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new chums are , or join your old chums . " In October the invitations went off , and suddenly Capote was swamped with pleading messages from those whom he had left out . " I feel like I fell into a whole mess of piranha fish , " he moaned to Women 's Wear Daily . Supposing someone tried to crash ? He would have bouncers to throw them out . <P> Came the Deluge . For days preceding the party last week , jets from London , Paris , Rome , Washington , Los Angeles and Garden City , Kans. , flew in the guests. * All day before the ball , fashionable East Side hairdressers fought off nervous breakdowns , and the 16 hosts and hostesses who had volunteered to give pre-ball dinners simmered on the verge of hysteria . Capote and Kay Graham had a quiet little " bird and bottle " picnic supper in his Plaza suite . As the hour for the party approached , Capote 's chums became as anxious as he . Said Mrs. Leland Hayward : " We 're so dearly fond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this publicity , the party might flop . " <P> There was no need to fret . Shortly after 10 p.m. , the deluge came . By the droves , masked figures ducked in out of the rain , past the reporters and TV lights in the lobby , pushed their way into elevators , and passed the two check-in tables on their way to greet Truman and Kay at the ballroom door .
