In the Congo , it rained all week . Flash floods washed out streets of Leopoldville 's native city , where hundreds of huts slowly caved in under the ceaseless downpour . In Coquilhatville , striking civil servants who had not been paid for three months gave up their picketing in the driving rain and stayed indoors . This was the land of crisis , the subject of endless U.N . debates , but on the scene it wore a lethargic air . <P> Well-fed Belgians , the tails of their sports shirts hanging over their khaki shorts , clogged the noisy Manhattan Bar at Leopoldville 's Hotel Regina , and diners at the Sabena guest house could still enjoy coquilles St. Jacques , snails and mussels flown in from Brussels . With the flood of U.N . soldiers in town , the souvenir business was bigger than ever ; on every street corner , the inevitable Hausa traders from Nigeria offered carved ivory , lizard handbags and ebony figures at prices tailored to the foreigners ' handsome wages . <P> If the natives were restless , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jolly , giggling , black taxi drivers , who clustered outside all the hotels , clamoring for attention when a potential passenger strode out to the street . The statistics proved that 60,000 were jobless in Leopoldville ; yet carefree Africans drank the local Primus or Polar beer until all hours at the neighborhood taverns . <P> A thousand miles to the east , in Katanga 's little copper-rich capital of Elisabethville , the flame trees were out in glorious profusion alongside the spacious swimming pools of the Union Minire officials , whose mines and refineries were working at capacity . If the service had deteriorated at the little Hotel Leopold II , the cannibal sandwich ( raw hamburger , raw egg , chopped onion ) remained excellent at the terrace dining room . No one much cared when news arrived that Katanga 's mercenaries had clashed with the U.N . ' s Ethiopian troops up north where President Moise Tshombe was clearing out his enemies . <P> Things are less pleasant at Stanleyville , the headquarters of Moscow-backed Antoine Gizenga , where months of near anarchy have left their mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , once 4,000 , had dwindled to a hardy 250 . Along the Avenue Wagenia , many of the shops are closed , and salt and sugar are not to be found . In Gizenga 's interior plantation country , the few remaining whites pay token salaries to black workers to fight back the encroaching jungle , despite the fact that markets for their goods are well-nigh gone . Down at Luluabourg , once the prosperous commercial center of Kasai province , only two shops in the European section remain open-a jeweler and a hardware dealer . Everything else is closed along the main street , where the local Africans doze in the shelter of over hanging sidewalk roofs , occasionally rising to walk out into the drizzle and urinate on the sidewalk .
