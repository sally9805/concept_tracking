" Here comes the bride , " sang the host , a tall , genial man standing in the cabin with a highball in his hand , the very picture of relaxation . And when Lady Bird appeared , smiling tolerantly , he planted a resounding husband 's kiss on her cheek . Later , he resumed his attentions to his guests-among them , two of the some dozen slightly incredulous members of the Washington press corps . They were all down on the L.B.J. ranch in Texas by invitation of the President , and it was a weekend none of them is likely to forget . <P> If there was any lingering doubt that Lyndon Johnson likes his press relations on the easygoing side , those doubts were removed last week . The guest list at the L.B.J. ranch seemed to be limited not so much by presidential hospitality , which was boundless , as by the number of correspondents who asked to see the President . <P> High-Speed Tour . Chicago Sun-Times Editorial Cartoonist Bill Mauldin asked permission to land his own plane on the ranch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New York Times called from Phoenix . <P> Could he come over ?

He insisted that she sit next to him at dinner . Before a flight of three helicopters left the ranch , he sent Presidential Aide Jack Valenti over to pluck Marianne from one chopper and reinstall her in the President 's . <P> <P> Tom Wicker of the New York Times , Phil Potter of the Baltimore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were invited for a fish fry . Next morning Wicker was taken on a ride in the presidential Lincoln . Chauffeur : Lyndon B. Johnson . Velocity : up to 70 m.p.h . TIME 'S Hugh Sidey got a chicken dinner and a boat ride up the lower Colorado River . Guide : Lyndon B. Johnson . The Restons ' visit became practically a family outing . Learning that Reston 's son Richard , a Washington correspondent for the Los Angeles Times , was in Austin , Johnson ordered Presidential Press Secretary Pierre Salinger to round him up .
