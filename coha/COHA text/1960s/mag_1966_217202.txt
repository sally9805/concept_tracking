Sandra . " These shadows . . . the sifting of ashes of a dead past . " Thus whisper the winds of melancholy around a decaying palazzo in the Tuscan town of Volterra , where Director Luchino Visconti ( Rocco and His Brothers , The Leopard ) installs Claudia Cardinale as resident tragedienne . In Visconti 's modern variations on the Electra theme , Claudia struggles with a role that requires her , at times , to slip off the mantle of Greek tragedy and slip into something like a bath towel . <P> Married to a pipe-smoking , cameratoting American ( Michael Craig ) , Claudia returns home after many years to witness the unveiling of a memorial to her late father , a scientist who died at Auschwitz . He was denounced to the Nazis , Claudia believes , by her mother ( Marie Bell ) , who has since remarried and gone mad . Claudia 's brother , played with a nice sense of wasting vitality by Jean Sorel , is less interested in vengeance than in incest , about which he has written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bursting with scandalous secrets , Claudia begs him to destroy the book . The pair 's unseemly sibling passion ultimately leads to disgrace , violence and suicide . <P> Sandra , though lento-paced and pretentious , does create a bewitching atmosphere of decadence . While the old , ordered world passes into limbo , Visconti savors every detail of a cavernous manse where each drafty , half-lit corridor and every gleaming bit of crystal augurs ill . But finally the decor becomes a bore , and even Visconti 's human characters seem used up , lifeless , set into place like figures in a faded tapestry .
