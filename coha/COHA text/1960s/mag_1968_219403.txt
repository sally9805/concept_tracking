At key points in South Viet Nam , allied forces last week were placed on alert in anticipation of a new enemy offensive . Captured documents , prisoner interrogations and exhortations broadcast by the clandestine Viet Cong radio pointed to an imminent push-perhaps to coincide with the eighth anniversary of the founding of the guerrillas ' National Liberation Front on Dec. 20 . <P> While rumors of a new Communist drive have bedeviled Saigon frequently since August , allied officers were not inclined to dismiss the current crop out of hand . Heavy action near the Cambodian border , a sharp upsurge of activity in the Demilitarized Zone and the presence of perhaps 1,000 Viet Cong sappers ( demolition experts ) and other agents in Saigon all pointed to trouble . <P> The objective of such an offensive would , of course , be to create as much disruption and seize as much real estate as possible in the South before the negotiators in Paris finally get down to serious discussions . The Communists are fully aware that possession is nine-tenths of the war , as it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can secure before the talks get serious , the better their bargaining position will be . <P> Stripped Stage . Allied troops have countered by tightening up their defense rings around major cities and by boring in on the logistical groundwork that must precede any successful offensive . " If you can destroy the people who are preparing the battlefield , then the guys on the border ca n't get there , " explained a U.S. general . Thus , last week three regiments of the 1st Marine Division ended a three-week cordon operation in Quang Nam province south of Danang that stripped the area as a staging ground . They moved all 2,650 civilians out of the village of Thanh Phong , then encircled and hunted down infiltrators from a regiment of North Vietnamese regulars . The bag from Operation Meade River : 1,050 enemy dead v. 107 allied losses . Other units throughout South Viet Nam were engaged in similar operations , beating the woods and fields for bunkers , arms caches and stores of food and medicine . <P> Even while they worked to thwart a major new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before with the " other war " - the U.S.-directed pacification effort . Under any compromise reached in Paris , the political loyalties of the 12,000 hamlets that dot South Viet Nam 's countryside could have a profound effect on the future of the national government . With that in mind , President Nguyen Van Thieu last October launched a major drive to secure 1,120 new hamlets before the Tet holiday next February . Nearly half of all U.S. military operations are now launched in support of this political effort , and the work is apparently beginning to pay off : last week the U.S. announced that 73.3% of South Viet Nam 's population is under government control , up 6.5% in two months . It is even higher than totals claimed before the disastrous Tet offensive-though some observers believe that it may be considerably inflated . <P> Ruff-Puffs . Under the accelerated program , contested hamlets-and a few that are enemy-controlled-are entered by government Regional Forces or Popular Forces ( nicknamed Ruff-Puffs ) .                  @ @ @
