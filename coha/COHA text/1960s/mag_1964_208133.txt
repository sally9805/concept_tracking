Britain is a tiny land , smaller than Sweden or Italy , but its problems are as vast as its pride . Once the source of the greatest colonial empire since the days of the Romans , it has only with reluctance adapted to an age in which empire has withered-and with it much of the commercial power of a nation that must live by trade or perish . This year has been unkind for Britain ; the Labor Party 's victory has only served to accentuate problems that the defeated Conservatives had struggled with for months . The pound has been put in peril , confidence in Britain 's ability to adjust to the demands of the day has shrunk , and over the island that Blake called a " green and pleasant land " has grown an economic cloud that confuses , frightens and frequently infuriates its stalwart inhabitants . <P> Like a Fire . Last week , only a few weeks after the pound underwent one of its greatest tests of the century , Britain 's cloud seemed to darken perceptibly . Talk swept London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Labor , about the possibility of the pound 's devaluation , and about a deterioration in the balance of trade . Though not all-perhaps not much-of the gossip was solidly based on fact , it burned as persistently and as contagiously as a fire in a peat bog . <P> The hard news fed the fire . Britain 's government revealed that the trade deficit widened by another $288 million in November . The price of gold was pushed so high by the uncertainty-to the highest level since the Cuban missile crisis-that the Bank of England rushed to support both the securities market and the pound sterling . In a desperate effort to help alleviate its economic problems , Britain announced that it had taken advantage of a 1957 agreement and arranged a postponement of $138.1 million in repayments due the U.S. and $34.3 million due Canada on British reconstruction loans . As if all that were not enough , the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) denounced as " inconsistent " the 15% surtax Britain had placed on imports in an effort to right the out-of-joint balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Says Sir Leon Bagrit , the chairman of Elliott-Automation Ltd. : " The British economy is a little like Gulliver in Lilliput , when he could not move because of hundreds of cords holding him back . " <P> Attitude of Insularity . What are the cords that hold back what was once one of the world 's most powerful economies - and now is one of its most troubled ? There are no great secrets about the failure of the British economy to meet its challenges : its root troubles lie in listless management , the wasteful use of labor , small-scale and inefficient production and indifferent salesmanship . At the heart of these manifestations is less of an inherent economic weakness than a national attitude of insularity , a stubborn refusal from top to bottom to believe that Britain 's standard of living-and its standing in a prospering world - depends on how much it can sell to a world that is increasingly choosy about what it buys from whom .
