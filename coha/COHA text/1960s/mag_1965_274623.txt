West Germany 's lithe and lively Porsche is the rich man 's Volkswagen . Like Volkswagen , Porsche ( pronounced Portia ) had not altered its size or appearance since it was founded 16 years ago , had nonetheless thrived on constant engineering change and a mystical appeal to buyers , who pay up to $6,300 for the privilege of owning one . Like Rolls-Royce and Mercedes , however , the Porsche has been over taken by the times . It has just brought out two new models that radically de part from the upside-down soupspoon look that has made the Porsche one of the most popular sports cars . The new cars , one of which will also have almost a 40% boost in horsepower , are distinguished by a straighter , less sloping front and a fastback , built around a brand-new chassis . <P> Brooding Boss . The similarity between Porsche and Volkswagen is not accidental . Porsche got its name from the late Ferdinand Porsche , who built his first car in 1899 , went on to design the first Volkswagen in 1936 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elefant and Tiger tanks that terrorized Europe in World War II , spent two years in a French prison as a war criminal . Porsche 's postwar success is a product of his son , Ferry Porsche , 56 , a cautious , brooding engineer . Ferry brought Porsche from a garage in Gmnd , Austria to a glass-and-concrete factory outside Stuttgart , where 2,400 workers now turn out 56 cars a day-every one handmade and every engine stamped with the initials of the master mechanic who assembled it . Porsche sales last year reached $40 million , a 350-fold increase over 1949 . <P> Porsche pulls in as much as $10 million a year from the licenses ( mostly for its patented synchromesh gear box ) that it sells to such automakers as Italy 's Ferrari and Germany 's BMW . Its closest ties are still with Volkswagen . Besides a royalty of 250 for every Volkswagen that rolls off the assembly line , Porsche reaps from VW an additional research-and-development fee . <P> Flick , Flick . Ferry Porsche doggedly refuses to tie himself more closely to Volkswagen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Porsche owners are such as Elke Sommer , Herbert von Karajan , Prince Rainier , Ingemar Johansson , Juan Carlos of Spain and Krupp Heir Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach . Like Porsche owners everywhere , they flick their headlights in salute as they pass on the highway , even at 100 m.p.h . U.S. highways now boast 29,000 Porsches , and half of Porsche 's production is sold in the U.S. ; demand is so strong that U.S. buyers must now wait two to three months for delivery . <P> Some Porsche addicts even go in for a form of reverse snobbery , put Porsche engines in Volkswagens . One such car is owned by Actor Paul Newman , three more by Racing Buff Art Sparks of Pasadena . " It 's a great satisfaction , " says Sparks , " to come up behind a Cadillac on a hill on the way to Las Vegas , let him have the horn and go breezing by . They wonder what happened .
