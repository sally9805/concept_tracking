Her manager calls her " The Animal . " " She moves just like Elvis , " he says . Adds her director : " When she starts singing , I hafta chase my kids out of the room . " This nemesis of children is a babyfaced , 20-year-old Swedish-born singer named Ann-Margret Olson , who , with an arcane appeal to the teen-age mystique , has one of the summer 's fastest-moving single records . Songstress Margret ( she has dropped her last name professionally ) is that rarity in the record field : a girl singer who can really make a pop song pop . In a pulsating , slightly nasalized voice , pleasant but still more callow than mellow , she bleats across the land a sugary lament called / Just Do n't Understand : <P> <P> Well , you say that you need me <P> Like the ocean needs sand <P> But the way you mistreat me <P> I just do n't understand . <P> On the road to teen idolatry , Margret took dancing lessons in a Chicago suburb , where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debut as a radio singer was not auspicious : she lost out on an amateur hour when she was 16 to a Mexican leaf player . Leaving Northwestern University at the end of her freshman year , she got a job singing in a restaurant lounge , was heard and hired by George Burns for his Las Vegas show . Burns gave her some professional advice : get out of her new red velvet slacks and into black Lastex and cashmere . She did , swiveled her hips for good measure-and was quickly signed up by RCA . <P> Other pop records : <P> Enroll Garner : Dreamstreet ( ABC-Paramount ) . The first recording in almost three years by the distinguished acrobat whose feats must be heard to be disbelieved . Pianist Garner still has more than his fair share of fingers , but their presence often stupefies rather than charms . A notable exception : the trip-hammered , polyrhythmic ride he gives to the Rodgers-Hart lady who was a tramp . <P> Quarter to Three ( U.S. Bonds ; Legrand ) . His name really is U.S. ( for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice so gravelly that he suggests a whole convention of really nasty-sounding hop-trotters . The chaotic results are what buyers of this bestseller deserve . <P> Maysa Sings ( Columbia ) . A Brazilian singer with a smokily wistful voice speaks of old , unforgotten loves : Something to Remember You By , The End of a Love Affair , The Man That Got Away . Occasional faint echoes of Dietrich but without the Dietrich poise . <P> Stan Kenton : The Romantic Approach ( Capitol ) . A good big band is rare , and a new one these days is rarer . This band is one of the best Kenton ever put together . The instrumentation is unique even for one of popular music 's most tireless experimenters : no strings , generous contingents of trumpets , trombones , saxes , and an instrument of Kenton 's own invention - the mellophonium , midway between trumpet and trombone . The result is as smooth as butter , whipped by Kenton 's artfully lagging beat and caressing tone in ballads like Moonlight in Vermont . <P> Dum Dum ( Brenda Lee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is on with another hit . At 16 , after ten years in the business , she shows remarkably few signs of wear . <P>
