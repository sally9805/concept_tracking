" The risks in this corner of the world have increased , " said Australia 's Prime Minister Sir Robert Gordon Menzies . speaking of Southeast Asia and the South Pacific . He was putting it mildly . Moreover , in the entire " corner , " the country perhaps least prepared to defend itself is Australia , whose Digger-hatted fighting men distinguished themselves in two world wars . In the past decade , Australia has enjoyed so much peace and prosperity that it has become known as the land without a crisis , and its defense structure shows it . <P> Radar 9 to 5 . The speediest operational craft in the Australian air force are ten-year-old , subsonic F-86s , which are only slightly faster than modern jet airliners . The air force is even short of grease monkeys , must farm out repairs to private mechanics . Australia 's combat fleet consists of 14 antiquated vessels-the aircraft carrier Melbourne , three destroyers ( there were four until the Melbourne accidentally sliced one in half last February ) , and a handful of frigates and minesweepers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 150 troops ; its coastal guns have been dismantled and sold to Japan as scrap ; Darwin has no antiaircraft batteries , and until last month the single radar station operated from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m . Mondays through Fridays only . <P> With the increasingly gloomy outlook in the South Viet Nam war , the Indonesian raids on Malaysia , not to mention the Red Chinese bomb , something obviously had to be done . The most immediate worry : Indonesia ( pop . 100 million ) , with which Australia shares a jungled border on the island of New Guinea ; since Australian troops are helping to fight Indonesian infiltrators in Malaysia , Sukarno could easily retaliate by sending infiltrators into Australian-controlled New Guinea . <P> Prime Minister Menzies ' government has tried to shape up defenses . Standing by its Commonwealth and SEATO commitments , Australia reinforced its expeditionary force in Malaysia , increased the number of Australian military advisers in South Viet Nam to 60 . To bolster home defenses , the government ordered 100 supersonic Mirage jets from France and 24 TFX ( now known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three U.S.-made missile-firing destroyers and four British Oberon submarines . Last week Menzies carried the beef-up further , announced the reinstatement of the draft , which had been dropped in 1959 . <P> Tier for Protection . Under the new draft , young men will register upon reaching age 20 , serve two years of active duty . The first 4,200 are to be inducted during the latter half of 1965 , after which inductions will continue at the rate of 6,900 men a year-which will increase army manpower from 22,750 at present to 37,500 by 1966 . <P> There are to be more equipment refinements , and two new airbases will be constructed-one in New Guinea ; several other strips will be renovated across Australia 's northern tier . The buildup will cost nearly $500 million over the most recent defense commitments for the next three years . But the new measures , which will take years to implement , are being criticized as too little too late . Said Arthur Calwell , leader of the Labor Opposition and longtime critic of the government 's military policies : " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is defenseless. "
