As exasperating as he is talented and as determined as he is eccentric , Bobby Fischer promises to become the game 's most respected and least understood champion . RUSSIA 'S traditional hold on World Championships in chess is about to be challenged by the United States in the person of an eighteenyear-old boy from Brooklyn named Bobby Fischer . Bobby has been United States Chess Champion for four years . He won the title at the age of fourteen , the youngest player ever to do so . He has since successfully defended his title three times and has won virtually every major chess title in the country . In an international tournament at Bled , Yugoslavia , last summer , he astonished the chess world by defeating Russia 's Mikhail Tal in his only game against this former World Champion . The present World Champion , Mikhail Botvinnik , did not participate in the tournament . Fischer is aching to play Botvinnik . " I know that I deserve to be World Champion and I know I can beat Botvinnik , " he has said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Fischer may have his chance early in 1963 when the triennial chess World Championship will be played . He will first have to win two preliminary international tournaments , the Inter-Zonal and the Candidates , in 1962 . Many of America 's leading chess authorities agree with Lisa Lane , the twenty-four-year-old Women 's Chess Champion of the United States . " I 'm sure that Bobby can beat Botvinnik , " she has said . " There 's never before been a chess player with such a thorough knowledge of the intricacies of the game and such an absolutely indomitable will to win . I think Bobby is the greatest player that ever lived . " John W. Collins , columnist for Chess Life and Chess Review and one of the country 's most highly respected chess annotators , has written : " Bobby is the finest chess player this country ever produced . His memory for the moves , his brilliance in dreaming up combinations , and his fierce determination to win are uncanny . Not only will I predict his triumph over Botvinnik but I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest chess player that ever lived . " Frank Brady , business manager of the United States Chess Federation , the governing body of American chess , has said " Russians have held chess World Championships in all but three of the past thirty-four years . Bobby is the man who will break that chain . Definitely . Maybe not in 1963 , maybe not even in 1966 , but eventually , for sure . " Botvinnik himself has acknowledged Fischer as a threat to Russia 's chess supremacy . Last May he deplored the decline in the popularity of chess in Russia ( which remains , nevertheless , the most chess-mad country in the world ) and he cited the possibility that Fischer might win the World Championship for the United States . It is safe to say that Bobby Fischer has aroused greater admiration for his chess-playing skill than any young player has ever before enjoyed . It is also a painfully well-known fact in the chess world , however , that never before has a young player aroused so much personal antipathy , This ill will seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Open Champion , has described as Fischer 's " colossal egotism . " Horowitz says : " The huge egos of great chess players are legendary . Psychologists have been amazed by their vanity , have studied it , and anecdotes concerning it are abundant . But never before has there been such a prima donna as Bobby .. .. Already he has managed to alienate and offend almost everybody in the chess world . That includes 50 A YOUNG CHESS MASTER officials , patrons , writers , almost everybody and anybody who might be in a position to help him in his career . " It was chiefly to try to find the clue to Fischer 's much discussed temperament that I arranged to interview him last summer . 110W A GENTLEMAN LIVES B O B B Y came to my office in midtown Manhattan last August 25 . The date had been made for the day before at three o'clock , but at four he had phoned to say that he just did n't feel like coming . When he did appear , he was again an hour late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strode halfway across the room , and greeted me with the words , " Hey , do you have some food up here or something ? " I said I would phone for some food and asked what he wanted . " A turkey white meat on rye , two celery sodas , some tea , and a couple plums , " he said . Fischer is handsome , over six feet tall , with broad shoulders , intense hazel eyes , and sharp features . " Do you go to school ? " I asked . " No , I 'm a professional chess player . T quit school when I was sixteen . " " Lisa Lane has said ? and lots of other people agree ? that you 're probably the greatest chess player alive . " " That statement is accurate , but Lisa Lane really would n't be in a position to know . They 're all weak , all women . They 're stupid compared to men . They should n't play chess , you know . They 're like beginners . They lose every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman player in the world I ca n't give knight-odds to and still beat . " " How about the men champions , like the Russians , Botvinnik , Tal , Keres , Smyslov , can you beat diem ? " They have nothing on me , those guys . They ca n't even touch me . Some people rate them better than me . That really bugs me . They think that no Americans play chess . When I meet those Russian potzers I 'll put them in their place . " ( " Potzer , " an ugly and insulting word in its original Yiddish , means an inferior player in chess parlance , where it is used without insulting connotation . Bobby 's English is entirely free of profanity . ) " Would you consider yourself the greatest player that ever lived , even better , say , than Capablanca , Steinitz , or Morphy ? " " Well , I do n't like to put things like that in print , it sounds so egotistical . But to answer your question , Yes . " " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " A strong memory , concentration , imagination , and a strong will . " " Does mathematical ability have anything to do with it ? " " Very little . " I was surprised by this last statement but later checked it and found that Bobby was entirely correct . Psychological tests have shown that chess masters do not necessarily excel in math , or , for that matter , in general intelligence . What they do possess is almost total recall as regards chess moves , fantastic imagination , and marvelous perception for spatial relations enabling them to glance at the thirty-two pieces and sixty-four squares of a chessboard and fashion a winning pa ttern of moves from the possible 1,000,000 , - **47;1739;TOOLONG , - 000,000,000,000,000 variations that the average tournament game of forty-five moves can take . " How does one make a living at chess ? " I asked . " Reshevsky and I are the only ones in America who try . Samuel Reshevsky is America 's secondbest chess player . We do n't make much . The other masters have outside jobs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he works for the movies . The Russians , they get money from the government . We have to depend on tournament prizes . And they 're lousy . Maybe a couple hundred bucks . Millionaires back this game , but they 're all cheap . Look what they do for golf : thirty thousand dollars for a tournament is nothing . But for chess they after them , everybody has to bow down to them , play when they want , everything - for a couple thousand dollars which is nothing to them anyhow . They take it off their income tax . These people are cheap . It 's ridiculous . " A reliable estimate which I later received fixed Fischer 's and Reshevsky 's average yearly prize winnings at $5,000 each . This just about covers Ralph Ginzburg 's ( ) nice is four flights up a spiral staircase on top of an old thirty-story offlee building in Manhattan . Since Army service in the Korean War , he has been a newspaperman , photographer , advertising man , stag member of " Look " and " Esquire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unhurried View of Erotica . " He plays lots of chess , but Bobby Fischer beat him ( he says ) in three seconds flat . their chess-playing expenses . In short , they earn no surplus directly from playing . Reshevsky , aged forty-nine , a married man with a family , receives a stipend from the American Chess Foundation . Bobby , who lives alone in a Brooklyn flat , has his rent , food , and clothing bills paid by his mother . " Why this lack of support by millionaires ? " " It 's the fault of the chess players themselves . I do n't know what they used to be , but now they 're not the most gentlemanly group . When it was a game played by the aristocrats it had more like you know dignity to it . When they used to have the clubs , like no women were allowed and everybody went in dressed in a suit , a tie , like gentlemen , you know . Now , kids come running in in their sneakers ? even in the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's a social place and people are making noise . it 's a madhouse . " Bobby 's voice was beginning to take on a whine as he became more relaxed . I noticed that his fingernails were badly bitten . " Am I correct in surmising that there are quite a number of Jews in the tipper echelons of chess ? " ! " Yeh , there are too many Jews in chess . They seem to have taken away the class of the game . They do n't seem to dress so nicely , you know . That 's what I do n't like . " " You 're Jewish , are n't you ? " " Part Jewish . My mother is Jewish . " - It 's been said , Bobby , that in your relations with some of the people in the chess world you behave very much like a prima donna . How about that ? " " Well , I 'm not sure I know what you mean by a prima donna , but if something does n't interest me or if someone bores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I just do n't bother with them , that 's all . " " How about school , did that bore you ? " " You do n't learn anything in school . It 's just a waste of time . You lug around books and all and do homework . They give too much homework . You should n't be doing homework . Nobody 's interested in it The teachers are stupid . They should n't have any women in there . They do n't know how to teach . And they should n't make anyone go to school . You do n't want to go , you do n't go , that 's all . It 's ridiculous . I do n't remember one thing I learned in school . I do n't listen to weakies Bobby 's term for non-chess players or for chess players who are weaker than himself . My two and a half years in Erasmus High I wasted . I did n't like the whole thing . You have to mix with all those stupid kids . The teachers are even stupider than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Half of them are crazy . If they 'd have let me , I would have quit before I was sixteen . " BIRTH OF AN OBSESSION W HEN 1 asked Bobby about his personal life , he said he was born March 9 , 1943 , in Chicago . His father was a physicist and his mother a registered nurse and schoolteacher . He has an older sister . When he was a baby , his parents were divorced . His mother took him and his sister to California , Arizona , and then Brooklyn , where the Family settled . Bobby 's father left the country soon after his son was born and Bobby has no recollection of him . Bobby 's mother provided all of the family 's support . ( Bobby 's sister , Mrs. Joan Targ , later described their mother to me as a woman of great intellect and boundless energy , She is accomplished in at least half-a-dozen languages and holds a pre-med degree . She is also " something of a professional crusader , " as Mrs. Targ said . At the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way across Europe to Moscow as part of a pacifist antiwar demonstration . Mrs. Targ underscored the fact that Bobby had never come under the strong influence of a man at any time during his formative years . ) Bobby began to play chess at the age of six . " My sister bought me a set at a candy store and taught me the moves , " he said to me . At first it was just one of many board games that Bobby was interested in . At the age of nine , however , he became obsessed with the gable and began to exhibit talent . He was invited to play at some of the city 's best chess clubs , and when he was thirteen he entered tournament play . He soon won the U. S. Junior Championship , the New York Metropolitan Chess League Championship , and the coveted Lessing J. Rosenwald Chess Trophy . ( In winning the Rosenwald Trophy he played a game that was so intricate in its combinations , so brilliant in its ingenuity , so fraught with apparent ? but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Game of the Century . " ) In 1957 , when Bobby was fourteen , he won the U. S. Championship and the following year , at fifteen , he was the youngest player to be designated an International Grand Master by the Federation Internationale Des Echecs ( FIDE ) , the world governing body of chess ? the highest of all honorary chess titles . " After that I quit school , " Bobby said . " How did your mother feel about that ? " PHOTOGRAPH OF BOBBY FISCHER BY RALPH GINZBCBC " She and I just do n't see eye to eye together . She 's a square . She keeps telling me that I 'm too interested in chess , that I should get friends outside of chess , you ca n't make a living from chess , that 1 should finish high school and all that nonsense . She keeps in my hair and I do n't like people in my hair , you know , so I had to get rid of her . " " You mean that she moved out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she moved in with her girl friend in the Bronx and I kept the apartment . But right now she 's away on this trip with those people the pacifists for about eight months . I do n't have anything to do with her . " " I was under the impression that she had had a great deal to do with the success of your career . Did n't she go on a hunger strike last year and picket the White House to dramatize the need for funds to send you and the American team to the Chess Olympics in Leipsig ? " " Yeh , but she does n't know what she 's doing . She ought to keep out of chess . " I asked him to describe a typical day in his life . " Lots of the time I 'm traveling around . Europe , South America , Iceland . But when I 'm home , I do n't know , I do n't do much . I get up eleven o'clock maybe . I 'll get dressed and all , look at some chess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own meals . I do n't believe in that stuff . I do n't eat in luncheonettes or Automats , either . 1 like a waiter to wait on me . Good restaurants . After I eat 1 usually call up some ofmy chess friends , go over and analyze a game or something . Maybe I 'll go to a chess club . Then maybe I 'll see a movie or something . There 's really nothing for me to do . Maybe I 'll study some chess book . " " You travel around the city mainly by sub-way ? " " Unfortunately , yes . It 's dirty ? kids there see I have nice shoes on so they try to step on them on purpose . People come in there in their work clothes and all , people come charging in like animals , it 's terrible . People sitting and staring directly across the aisles at you , it 's barbaric . " " Do you have any one or two closest friends ? " " No , I do n't keep any close friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need friends . I just tell everybody everything , that 's all . " I asked him if this policy of 100 per cent honesty toward everybody at all times was n't perhaps at the core of his difficulty in dealing with people . That is , if his Forthrightness had n't perhaps sometimes been misinterpreted as tactlessness . Bobby said that that might have been the case . WHAT IS AN UNCIVIL HOUR ? A S WE discussed his difficulties with people in the chess world , I brought up a number of his most publicized controversies and asked Bobby for his side of the story . In each case he was able to present what sounded like perfectly reasonable explanations for the position he had taken . Whether or not he subsequently damaged his position by obstinacy and unwillingness to compromise is another question . In 1959 , for example , he caused a rhubarb by refusing to defend his title as U. S. Champion unless pairings for the tournament were drawn in public , though hitherto they had always been drawn in private . Explaining this action , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U. S. Chess Federation a FIDE rule which required public drawings . The officials admitted that they had been violating the rule unknowingly , and they promised to draw the pairings for all future tournaments in public . Although it would seem that Fischer had made his point , their promise did not satisfy him , and he insisted that the pairings already made ? and announced ? for 1959 be withdrawn . When the officials refused , he threatened not to defend his title . Eventually , he was forced to back down ; he played and won . But as far as the general public was concerned , his earlier triumph of principle was demolished . In a second highly publicized incident , just last summer , Bobby forfeited a sixteen-game , cross-country match to Reshevsky , because the twelfth game of the series was set for 11:00 A.M. , an hour that Bobby regarded as uncivil for playing chess . Explaining this to me , he said that the match had originally been scheduled for play at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Los Angeles on Sunday , August @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that morning , he received a phone call from the referee of the game saying that playing time had been moved up to eleven . This , he said , was to accommodate the wishes of the principal patron of the series , Mrs. Jacqueline Piatigorsky , who wanted to be sure the game would be over in time for her to attend a concert to be given that night by her husband , cellist Gregor Piatigorsky . Bobby refused to play at that early hour and cited a clause in his playing contract which stated that playing time had to be acceptable to him . When Bobby failed to show up , the Los Angeles referee announced the game a forfeiture in favor of Reshevsky . The score of the series up to then had been tied at 51/2 games each . The forfeiture put Reshevsky ahead , 61/2 to 51/2 . The next game was to be played in New York four days later . Fischer refused to continue the series unless the forfeiture were first overruled . No one at the New York offices of the American Chess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the decision of the Los Angeles referee and it was almost certain that in due time the forfeiture would be overruled . But Chess Foundation officials resented a threat to quit . " Fischer is holding a gun to our heads , " the president , Walter Fried , told the New York Times . When playing time for the thirteenth game arrived , the Chess Foundation had not vet overruled the forfeiture and Fischer did not show up for the game . The entire series was then declared a victory by default for Reshevsky and the trophy and prize money were awarded him . " There was no other course we could take consistent with our responsibility and our selfrespect , " Fried said later . Bobby told me that in each of these cases he was merely " defending " his " principles . " It is this rigid adherence to principle ? to the point of self-destruction ? that seems to characterize almost all of his difficulties . " I DECIDED TO DRESS UP " T H E topic of the interview changed to clothing . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said . " Was n't there a time when you dressed rather carelessly yourself ? Were n't you once pictured in a full-page photograph in Life playing simultaneous chess against a group of older men who were respectably dressed while you were wearing sneakers and blue jeans ? " " Yeh , I used to dress badly until I was about sixteen . But people just did n't seem to have enough respect for me , you know ? And I did n't like that , so / decided I 'd have to show them they were n't any better than me , you know ? They were sort of priding themselves . They would say he beat us at chess , but he 's still just an uncouth kid . So I decided to dress up . " I noted that Bobby was wearing a green , vertically striped tie , white shirt , and a brown checked suit with tightly pegged pants . He was meticulously groomed , though his clothes showed no particular individuality . " Where do you buy your clothes ? " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Where ? " " Different places . This one I had made in Germany . " " Have you any particular objection to readymade clothes ? " " Oh , I would n't touch them . I have my shoes made to order , my shirts , everything . I like to dress classy . I have seventeen suits now , all handtailored . " " Clothes arc just a weakness with you , is that it ? " " No , just a strength . " He laughed . " I do n't know . I 've had suits made in Argentina , Trinidad , England , New York , California , East Germany , West Germany , and I guess that 's all , so far . IF you get seventeen suits , you can rotate them . They wear a long time . That 's where the poor man gets it coming and going . His suits wear out fast and he never has a wardrobe to choose from . " " You say your shoes are handmade , too ? " " Yeh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bucks a pair . I 've got five pairs , not counting ready-mades , which I do n't wear anymore anyhow . " " What about shirts , where do you get them ? " " This place called Sy 's ; they cost twenty-five dollars each . It 's the same place where Kennedy gets his made . I found out who Kennedy 's tailor is in England . I might go there , too , " " You like Kennedy ? Would you have voted For him ? " " I do n't think so . I do n't like to see millionaires in there . He has it too soft , you know . I do n't think he 's ever had any hardships . Besides , he does n't have any class . He puts his hands in his coat pockets . God , that 's horrible ! " " Where do you have your laundry done ? " 54 A YOUNG CHESS MASTER This shirt I 'm wearing I sent to some stupid laundry in New York . They ruined it . I lugged the shirts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mad about that . On my way to Yugoslavia next week , I 'll stop off in Italy and get some shirts to make up for it . I hear they cost only ten dollars in Milan . You know they say you can tell the decline of a nation when the people begin to lose interest in their clothes . Nowadays if you 're dressed up people think you 're a dandy . In the olden dayS the most virile men were the men who dressed the best . " I then asked Bobby if he had any interest outside of chess and clothes . Apparently not . He had recently wanted to learn judo . but after inspecting New York 's judo schools he found them " too tow-class for me with too much riffraff and no place to put your clothes , " and so he abandoned the idea . For a while he was interested in " occult subjects , " palmistry in particular . " Palmistry is a definite science , " he said . " It 's not just a bunch of nonsense like astrology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a flexible mind and a soul that has been calloused by the hard knocks of life . " Like I 'm not as soft or as generous a person as I would be if the world had n't changed me . " Bobby listens to short-wave radio a bit , particularly if a chess match is being broadcast over the Voice of Moscow . He says that his favorite actor is Marlon Branc ) but adds that " in Hollywood they say he 's terribly conceited . " He does n't watch TV much . He is , as he says , " a cautious person " and he read somewhere that " every time you watch TV you get a little radiation " so he stays away from TV . Bobby does n't believe in God . " I read a book lately by Nietzsche and he says religion is just to dull the senses of the people . I agree . " Recently he had been reading about Dr. Fu Manchu , Hitler , and Caryl Chessman . " That was a pretty bad thing they killed Chessman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has read Errol Flynn 's My Wicked , Wicked Ways , a book which seems to have made a deep impression upon him . " Does Flynn 's sort of life appeal to you ? " " Well , yeh , a little bit . Yeh , I 'd like to travel around , be an international playboy . They have all that money , they could really do it right . Look at Flynn . " " You mean he had all those dames ? " Bobby laughed . " No , I mean all that money . " " Do you have a girl friend ? " " Naw , I do n't like American girls . They 're very conceited , you know . In Europe they 're more pleasant . " " Do you correspond with any special girl over there ? " " No , but I get a lot of fan mail from Europe . Chess is very big over there . Sometimes girls write me . One girl in Yugoslavia sent me a whole slew of love letters . I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowd watching me play . She says when I left there the stars fell out of the sky over Yugoslavia , or something like that . " We both laughed uproariously . " Are n't you afraid to go back to Yugoslavia ? " " Nope , " he answered still laughing . " Why is chess so much more popular in Yugoslavia than in the United States ? " " Well , you know , in America everybody is interested in making the dollar fast . In Yugoslavia no matter how much you hustle you 're not going to get rich , so you might as well play chess . " We had been talking for nearly five hours and it was time for me to drive Bobby home . " Before we end this , though , I just want to ask you one more question . " I said . " You 've rapped an awful lot of people today . I want to know what class or group of people . no matter how small , you admire without qualification . That is , do you feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is thoroughly respectable , intelligent , and entirely deserving of your admiration ? " There was a long pause . " Well , I . . . gee . I do n't know . " Bobby peered up sheepishly . " Wait ! There is : the aristocrats ! Yeh , I admire the aristocrats . You know , the millionaires , except they 're millionaires the way millionaires should he , not the way millionaires are . They 're the European millionaires . The French people , you know . Not like the American millionaires . Here you ca n't tell them apart from the other people . Some of them even drive Chevrolets . They dress casually and all , they 're like afraid to be looked at . They should be setting the standards for other people . Instead , they dress like slobs , you know . " " Have you ever met any of these European aristocrats ? Do you know for sure that they exist ? " " I have n't met any , yet . But I 've read about them ... like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The interview ended . Several things about him had become clear . First of all , whereas chess is just a game for most people , a diversion from life , for Bobby Fischer chess is life and everything that happens off the chessboard is a distracLion . Second , though Bobby is possibly the greatest chess player of all time , he is not a genius in other respects ( nor , incidentally , are most other chess masters of the world ) . Third , though Fischer is eighteen years old , he shows some traits of much younger children , who believe that the world is centered around filling their needs . Finally , though it was easy to see how Bobby could offend people with his sweeping statements , he does not show malice . Concerned with his own feelings , he is gentle , shy , almost timid . Bobby is , as his sister later told me , " a boy who requires an extra amount of understanding . " Perhaps this is inevitable for a boy who has grown up without a father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my car after leaving my office , we made two stops . The first was at a paperback bookstore where Bobby wanted to buy a book . He examined Commandant of Auschwitz and Bridge over the River Kwai and finally selected the store 's last copy of Bernard Baruch 's My Own Story . He seemed particularly impressed by the photographs of old Wall Street tycoons . " They were pretty snazzy in the old days , " he said . " Look how elegant and gentlemanly they are . " We next stopped at a posh espresso house for a bite to eat . Bobby ordered a slice of pecan cream pie , a side order of butter cookies , and an elaborate frozen pineapple drink . When he had finished his pie , I mentioned that the place was reputed to be owned and operated by homosexuals . Bobby was horrified and eyed the waiters narrowly . " Gee , you 'd think the place would die off with a reputation like that . " He turned his attention to his drink . " Maybe they put something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He did n't touch it again . Nor did he eat any more of his cookies . We drove to Bobby 's house located on the edge of Brooklyn 's Bedford-Stuyvesant district where the homicide and general crime rate is among the highest in the city . The house is a four-story walk-up with a barber shop and a candy store on the ground floor . He told me that his four-room apartment has a library of some two hundred chess books , piles of chess magazines , and an inlaid chess table made to order for him in Switzerland . There are three beds in the apartment , each with a chessboard beside it , and Bobby sleeps in them in rotation . It was a hot August night and men were sitting in undershirts on stoops up and down the street . Half-naked Negro and white children were playing hide-and-go-seek , and rock ' n ' roll music was blaring from a saloon juke box . The gutter was littered with pizza crusts , ice-cream wrappers , and empty beer cans . In his handmade suit , Bobby stepped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head into the window to say good-by . I asked him what he planned to do if and when he managed to beat Botvinnik and become the World Champion . " First of all , " he said , " I 'll make a tour of the whole world , giving exhibitions . charge unprecedented prices . I 'll set new standards . I 'll make them pay thousands . Then I 'll come home on a luxury liner . First-class . I 'll have a tuxedo made for me in England to wear to dinner . When I come home I 'll write a couple chess books and start to reorganize the whole game . I 'll have my own club . The Bobby Fischer .. . uh , the Robert J. Fischer Chess Club . ICl/ be class .

And a yacht . Flynn had a yacht . Then r11 have some more suits made . I 'd like to be one of the Ten Best-dressed Men . That would really be something . I read that Duke Snyder made the list .
