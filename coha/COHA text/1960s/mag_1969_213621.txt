To combat automobile exhaust fumes , which are responsible for about 60% of air pollution in the U.S. , the Federal Government has encouraged automakers to work together in developing antipollution devices for cars and trucks . Last week , in a civil antitrust suit filed in the U.S. District Court at Los Angeles , the Justice Department contended that the nation 's auto companies have in deed cooperated - but to impede , rather than promote , pollution control . Named in the suit as defendants were General Motors , Ford , Chrysler , American Motors and the Automobile Manufacturers Association . Seven smaller manufacturers were listed as co-conspirators but not as defendants . <P> The suit accuses Detroit of " hindering and delaying " the development of antipollution devices as far back as 1953 . It focuses on a " blow-by " connection that cuts down the outflow of hydro carbons and carbon monoxide by feeding unburned gasoline in the crankcase back into the engine . The blow-by , developed by G.M. , costs the consumer from $5 to $10 . It has been used on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ models . According to the Justice Department , the automakers could have installed the blow-by connectors a year earlier but agreed among them selves on a delay . <P> No Damages . In addition , the Government alleges that auto manufacturing executives lied by contending that it would be " technologically impossible " to introduce new **25;2432;TOOLONG devices on all 1966 models . They finally did so , says the Justice Department suit , only because companies out side the auto industry had developed similar devices . Detroit 's car companies are also accused of using a cross-licensing agreement to restrict the prices that they would pay to outside companies for pollution-control patents . <P> Though no outside firms are identified in the Government suit , a number of them , including W. R. Grace and American Machine &; Foundry , have developed devices for control of automobile exhaust pollution . In the case of those two companies , Detroit rejected their exhaust-control systems and adopted two of its own . Along with the older blow-by devices , the two newer systems are standard equipment - at a cost to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ models . <P> Auto manufacturers deny any wrong doing . The charges , said Chrysler , would " inevitably inhibit " the kind of joint at tacks on pollution that the Government claims it wants . Instead of demanding damages , the suit asks that the automakers be enjoined from doing in the future what they disclaim having done in the past .
