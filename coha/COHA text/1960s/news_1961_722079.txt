House , the Prime Minister 's ' temporary residence while 10 Downing Street is being repaired . Gromyko Asks Meeting The meeting was arranged at Mr. Gromyko 's request .

" During the discussion Mr. Macmillan emphasized Britain 's unalterable opposition to the stationing of Soviet troops in West Berlin . Britain would regard this , he said , as an infringement on the freedom of Berliners his Government is pledged to maintain . Mr. Gromyko apparently had suggested again the introduction of Russian forces into West Berlin as part of the establishment of a free city . This is the solution favored by the Soviet Government . Mr , Gromyko called the talk " interesting and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward , " he said , although it was difficult to judge " how many feet , how many meters we move forward . " TheSoviet Foreign Minister said his general impression after his talks with President Kennedy , Secretary of State Dean Rusk and the two British leaders was that there " is a growing understanding that everything must be done by all responsible governments and first and foremost by the governments of the great powers to , avoid a collision and find a peaceful solution of the outstanding problem " of Berlin .

" Mr. Gromyko , " a Soviet source said , " believes some good work has been done in the last three weeks . " Mr. Khrushchev is expected to announce the imminent signing of a peace treaty with the East German Communist government at the party Congress . British sources believed , however , that the way has been left open for further discussions between East and West that might lead to negotiations on the status of Berlin .

Thompson Jr . of the United States seconded by the British envoy , Sir Frank Roberts .

The maintenance of Allied forces in West Berlin , 3 . Guarantees under any circumstances of the rights of access to West - Berlin by the United States , ' Britain an &; France Ind by the West German Republic . Mr. Gromyko , it is understood , gave the impression that the Soviet Union would be willing to accept the interim solution discussed at the Geneva conference of foreign ministers in 1959 as a basis for beginning discussions . The British rejoinder apparently was that this solution was applicable only to that conference . The interim . solution for Berlin that was discussed at Geneva was to last for a term of years . This period was never finally agreed on at the negotiations . Under this solution there would have been a reduction of Western and Soviet forces in the city to an agreed level , an agreement , on the restriction of propaganda by both sides and a ban on subversive activities .                @ @ @ @ @
