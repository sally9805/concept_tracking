When the pros got around to divvying up the college catch at last week 's annual draft in Manhattan , one big fish was missing : Quarterback Jerry Rhome , 22 , of the University of Tulsa Missing , but not forgotten . Three teams , the New York Jets , the Dallas Cowboys , Canada 's Calgary Stampeders , drafted Rhome last year , when he was a junior , and the only question now is how much he is going to cost the lucky bidder . Last week Rhome hiked the starting price another notch by flinging 29 passes and completing 18 for 234 yds. and two touchdowns , leading Tulsa to a 21-7 victory over Wichita and a berth in the Bluebonnet Bowl . <P> By Rhome 's standards , that was a horrible day . Oklahoma State boasted the nation 's second-best pass defense before it ran into Tulsa in October Rhome hit on 35 of 43 for 488 yds. ' and moved an awestruck pro scout to exclaim : " We could n't complete that many if we were only playing catch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touchdown passes ; against Houston , he threw one that traveled a fantastic 60 yds. in the air . In Tulsa 's ten games ( eight wins , two losses ) this season , Rhome has completed 224 out of 326 passes ( a percentage of .687 ) for 2,870 yds. and 32 TDs-major college records all . His 3,128 yds . <P> of total offense is an alltime record as well , and he has broken another dozen or so minor marks during his three varsity years . <P> The pro bidding for Rhome will probably start somewhere around $20 , - 000 for a bonus-which is more than the Jets apparently want to spend . Last week they gave Houston their rights to Rhome in return for a draft choice Jets Coach Weeb Ewbank did his best to explain the decision : " I 'd have to say that the boy is accurate in the 10-to 15-yd. range , " he said . " But I ca n't tell you whether he can throw long . " Then , too , Rhome is only 6 ft. tall : " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cynic would point out that if Jerry Rhome is too short , so are such pros as Washington 's Sonny Jurgenson , St. Louis ' Charley Johnson New York 's Y. A. Tittle , Minnesota 's ' Fran Tarkenton , and San Francisco 's George Mira.
