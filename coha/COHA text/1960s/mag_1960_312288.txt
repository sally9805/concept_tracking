Cuba 's President Osvaldo Dortics on tour of South America last week , was getting a small hello in diplomatic circles everywhere . But Dortics seemed willing to take the snubs for the chance to talk to crowds . <P> In Buenos Aires , his first stop , where he was ostensibly an honored guest at Argentina 's 150th birthday celebration . Dortics slipped away to confer secretly with chiefs of the anti-government Peronista Metal Workers Union . <P> In Uruguay , Dortics was flatly warned that his plan to address a street rally would be regarded as interference in its internal affairs . Bolivia 's government somehow delayed extending an invitation to Dortics so long that it was too late for him to accept . Peru shifted Dortics ' arrival to a distant military airfield and barred welcomers . Chile refused to admit him . Venezuela 's President Rmulo Betancourt sent his Foreign Minister to intercept the Cuban President in Buenos Aires and persuade him to stay away because his trip " was not convenient . " Dortics rejoined that he would visit Caracas unless Betancourt publicly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from five days to one . <P> Dortics , the indefatigable tourist , was unmoved . Everywhere he went he got in a little anti-U.S . propaganda . This led to Washington 's angriest note so far to Fidel Castro 's Cuba . Citing Dortics ' public declaration in Montevideo that property of U.S. citizens had not been confiscated but was fairly paid for , the Department of State said : " To our knowledge not a single American property owner has been reimbursed . " Washington listed eight other instances of Cuba 's " intense official campaign of slander " against the U.S. , among them Economic Czar " Che " Guevara 's statement that the U.S. 's $150 million-a-year sugar subsidy to Cuba was actually a " form of slavery . " Cuba rejected the U.S. protest .
