It was Saturday afternoon in New York , and the Journal-American 's Columnist ( " Man About Manhattan " ) and Theater Critic John McClain had a date with Mrs. Anne Ford , recently divorced from Henry Ford II . They were going to see the movie Tom Jones . And thereby hangs a tale . <P> " According to my theory , " wrote McClain in a Runyonesque account , " the whole thing was preordained . We get there at 4 p.m. instead of 4:40 when the next showing begins . " With time to kill , McClain and Mrs. Ford decided to have a cup of espresso . " It occurs to me that at such an hour on a Saturday afternoon in New York , the only places prepared to serve espresso coffee are large hotels . So I say why do n't we go to the Regency , the new hotel at Park and 61st . " Mrs. Ford suggested that they go to the Delmonico instead . But McClain felt an invisible force tugging him toward the Regency . <P> " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to go to the bar ? ' and I say , ' No , we just want a cup of coffee . ' So he leads us to a table in a small room next to the bar where there are a few tables and some banquettes , and he seats us exactly next to the only two other people in the room . <P> " And the only two other people in the small room are Frank Ryan , an old friend of mine who now lives mostly in Madrid , and Mrs. Christina Austin , who is the lady whose name was mentioned with Mr. Ford 's prior to and during the divorce . We are seated and settled in before the incredible coincidence is discovered , and then it is Mrs. Ford who has the poise to take charge . ' This had to happen some time , ' she whispers . <P> <P> ' I think the only gracious thing is to go over and say hello . You know , I 've never met her . ' <P> " So we get up and go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilized , but if there were a way to bottle up the electricity in that little room it would run the Ford industries for a solid year . Then we exit , rapidly , and go back to the theater and , I must say , that Tom Jones is a whale of a picture . "
