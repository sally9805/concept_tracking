In the annual scramble for appropriations on Capitol Hill , nothing has pleased Congress more than the Peace Corps ' stubborn refusal to spend every last cent of its budget . Honoring the idealism of 11,902 volunteer workers in 52 countries , it has shunned frills and pared costs , saving taxpayers roughly $45 million over four years . Peace Corps Director Jack Hood Vaughn , 47 , a feisty , compact ( 5 ft. 8 in. ) redhead , was commended by Vice President Humphrey for slashing $495 off the upkeep of each corpsman last year . <P> But this year Vaughn asked for more money . Amid a rush of requests for Peace Corps volunteers from all over the non-Communist world , he submitted a 1968 budget of $118.7 million , up from last year 's $110 million , to put 17,750 workers and trainees into 58 countries by next September . " It costs less money to make peace than war , " Vaughn reminded the House Foreign Affairs Committee . " But it still costs a lot . " Last week the message got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trimming 3% from his requested budget , in a period of all-round retrenchment so small a cut represented a solid vote of confidence in the Peace Corps . <P> Verve &; Versatility . Even though the Peace Corps rejects four out of five applicants , it is the country 's largest single employer of new college graduates . In the beginning , the corps sought specialists ; now it concentrates on volunteers with liberal-arts degrees . Their verve and versatility suit them for tackling villagers ' grass-roots problems where experts might feel wasted . Their average age is 24 , although an 80-year-old served as a nurse in Turkey and 142 volunteers currently are over 50 . <P> The range of work seems limited only by the Peace Corps ' collective imagination . Volunteers are in demand for more than 300 job categories , from agronomy , bacteriology and carpentry to X-ray technology and zoology . A team of corpsmen installed the University of Malaya 's first electronic computer ; one is a game warden in Ethiopia ; Gerald Brown , a volunteer from Douglas , Ariz. , conducts Bolivia 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lessons made her one of Iran 's most popular performers . The majority teach , and the Corps has even sent blind volunteers abroad to teach the blind . <P> Twi &; Pushtu . Inevitably , some ventures end in trouble . When corpsmen overcame a Senegalese tribal taboo against selling rice , farmers stopped growing it because the crop had lost its religious importance . An instructor watched helplessly while typewriters distributed in Ethiopia turned to junk for lack of care . Language training for the corpsmen was once squeezed into 50 hours , and one slum worker in a Chilean callampa did not have enough Spanish to ask how to get to the bus that would take him to work . " At times they miss the mark , " Vaughn confesses . " And when they do , it 's certain we helped them miss . " <P> To get back on target , Vaughn has upgraded pre-assignment training until it accounts for a quarter of his budget . Instruction has been stretched from eight to 14 weeks , with a minimum of 300 hours of language tutoring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Tswana , Sesotho , Pushtu , Waray-Waray and Bicolano.
