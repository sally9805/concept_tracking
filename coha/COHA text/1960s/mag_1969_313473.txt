It took Premier Golda Meir an entire month of bargaining to put together a Cabinet after last October 's elections , in which her Labor party failed to win an absolute majority . But the time was obviously well spent . Last week she introduced to the Knesset ( Parliament ) the largest Cabinet in Israeli history . A coalition of five parties representing nearly 90% of the electorate , Golda 's Cabinet was so large , in fact , that smaller chairs had to be used to accommodate the 24 ministers at the government table in the parliamentary chamber . <P> Reflecting the current mood in Israel , the new Cabinet was also the most militant in a decade . In a speech to the Knesset , Mrs. Meir reiterated her objections against Big Four peace plans ( " There is no point in playing with formula and compromise suggestions " ) , endorsed the building of more Israeli settlements in the occupied territories , and stressed that her government would settle for nothing less than a genuine peace accord in which the Arabs would accept Israel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Famous Name . Under the circumstances , the influence of Israel 's leading moderates has declined . Abba Eban , who has advocated trading captured areas for a peace settlement , retained the Foreign Ministry , but he is losing the important information division , which is being set up as a separate ministry . Golda , annoyed by Eban 's overly optimistic assessments of Israeli-U.S. relations , was reported to have told intimates that she did not really want " that man " in her Cabinet . Pinhas Sapir , who has spoken out against permanent settlement in the occupied areas , will soon lose the important post of Labor party secretary , but as Finance Minister will have the thankless task of struggling with Israel 's growing economic crisis . <P> By contrast , the hawks are on the rise . Moshe Dayan remains Defense Minister , and his wing of the Labor party has been strengthened by inclusion in the Cabinet of Technocrat Shimon Peres , who once served as David Ben-Gurion 's Deputy Defense Minister . <P> By far the most outspoken hawk of all is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most celebrated names in Israeli history . He is Major General Ezer Weizman , 45 , the former commander of the Israeli air force and the nephew of the late Chaim Weizmann , Israel 's first President ( Ezer dropped the second " n " as a gesture of independence ) . A member of the irredentist Gahal party , whose representation in the Cabinet increased from two to six , Weizman shed his uniform only last week to become Transportation Minister . <P> Weizman believes in sharp reprisals against the Arab terrorists . " If you do n't keep giving the Arabs a bloody nose from time to time , the Arab balloon will blow up . We are going to live like this , hacking at each other , for some time to come . " A fervent Zionist , Weizman has no patience with Israelis who would turn back occupied territories to the Arabs . " Do I have to preach to my children that I have the right to the land of Israel only where there are no Arabs ? " he asks . " Or do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this land because it is mine of right ?
