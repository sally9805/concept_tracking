The Unsaleable Molly Brown is a massive song-and-dancer derived from Meredith Willson 's also-ran Broadway musical of 1-960 . Defying the laws of levity , it follows an ebullient , money-grubbing Irish lass who marries a miner and gets rich so she can sashay in Denver 's high society . When the bluebloods snub her , she flounces off to Yurrup to bring home some dukes and duchesses , finally earns her place among the snobs and saves her marriage-for reasons clear only to musical comedy authors-by surviving the Titanic disaster . <P> Plot , though vaguely based on reality , is only one of Molly 's handicaps . The sound track seems to amplify every commonplace tune into a fugue for trip hammers . The red plush trappings of old Colorado , as Hollywood sees them , produce instant antipathy . And Broadway Leading Man Harve Presnell repeats his stage role with little more than stiff , strong-lunged precision . <P> But despite this freight of handicaps , Molly does not go under-mainly because of Debbie Reynolds . Having browbeaten MGM 's executives into letting her play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shirley MacLaine-Debbie Mollyfies the audience with all the raucous charm and irrepressible high spirits of a girl who is out to win the Derby astride a dead horse . As a comedienne , she spurns subtlety but makes the shortcoming seem a solid gold asset in a character who boasts : " I 'm a vulgar , extravagant nouveau riche American ! " She even works slick , if slightly unnerving , pathos into a moment of pining over her wedding ring , a jewel-encrusted cigar band bearing the fond inscription : " Always Remember Two Things-That I Love You , and the Name of the Bank . "
