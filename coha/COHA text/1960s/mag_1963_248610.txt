8-the opus-number title of Federico Fellini 's new film-is self-psychoanalysis in search of an answer . Fellini , who made La Dolce Vita , has a singular personal problem : why is he so preoccupied with making movies that speak of the emptiness of life ? He gets his answer , but unless Fellini 's problem has been preying on the mind of the viewer , he may not care to take on the director 's doubts and confusions . <P> <P> The cinematic catharsis is performed on two levels . The ostensible story tells of a director ( Marcello Mastroianni ) who has made a commitment to do a film , has the organization and backing all set , and is struggling to find an idea . On a more mystical plane , 8 casts light on his condition in a series of dream-and-memory sequences probing back into childhood . The film opens silently on a tunnel clogged with stalled cars and buses . As Mastroianni tries to start his car , fumes surge into it and he begins to suffocate . Mastroianni finally floats in fantasy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the sky . <P> Pulled down from the sky like a kite , Mastroianni wakes up in a cluttered bedroom at a sleazy spa . Circling sycophants plague him with questions about the movie , tiresome actresses whine that they can not possibly go before the cameras , reporters pepper him with questions ( " Are you a Communist ? Are you against the A-bomb ? " ) . <P> Fellini 's admitted moral dualism , in which his Roman Catholic upbringing wars with his present nihilism , comes into play . Eager to have an audience with an elderly cardinal , Mastroianni is led , like a sheet-wrapped Dante , down into a fumy inferno where the cardinal is stewing his skinny bones in a steam bath . Then , in a dream , Mastroianni sees himself as the black-cloaked master of a harem surrounded by all the women of his life , who adoringly bathe him , dry him , and carry him to dinner wrapped in a blanket . <P> At length , Mastroianni , his staff and friends and his embittered wife sit in a cavernous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment of fantasy : a critic , who has never ceased his sniping , is summarily taken up into the balcony and hanged . Reality again : everyone leaves the theater and a caravan takes them to an eerie Cape Canaveral set for the film , which is to be a science-fiction movie . Reporters badger Mastroianni once more , and he crawls under a table and shoots himself . This clears his head once and for all , and in a moment of revelation he sees that the way to turn chaos into creativity is to stop brooding about the hobgoblins of his dreams and to start working on a film about the real people who surround him . 8 is at least a wildly pictorial electroencephalogram , at best a fascinating ride down Fellini 's stream of unconsciousness . Says he : " All I can say is that it did me good to make it . It was a liberating experience . " But is that a reason for showing it publicly ?                @ @ @ @ @
