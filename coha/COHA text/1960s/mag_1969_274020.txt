When a patient has any one of a number of infections , his physician may write on a prescription blank : " Tetracycline , 250 mg. #16 . Sig. 1 caps , q.i.d . " That dosage of 250 milligrams is standard for any adolescent or adult , whether a 100-lb. girl or a 300-lb. man . Equally standard is the one capsule four times a day for about four days . <P> Such stereotyped prescribing is extremely unsound , says Pharmacologist Sumner Kalman of Stanford University . " There is no average man who always needs a particular dose of this or that drug on a certain daily schedule , " Dr. Kalman notes . Even patients who are identical in sex and size do not absorb a drug into the bloodstream at the same rate . Their systems do not metabolize the drug at the same rate . Moreover , their reactions to a drug may range all the way from nil to collapse and sudden death as a result of severe allergic shock . " The fate of a drug in the body is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personality trait , " says Kalman . " How dare we consider all patients the same ? We have to study the drug in the individual patient so that he can be placed upon a proper schedule . " <P> Across Ethnic Lines . The need for such procedures is being emphasized by a growing body of biochemical knowledge . " As a patient 's health changes , or as other drugs are used , " says Kalman , " the blood level of an important drug may change . " One example is the use of barbiturates in combination with digitalis . If a patient is on digitoxin , one of the digitalis products , and then uses barbiturates for a while , his heart-medicine dosage should be checked , and possibly adjusted , twice . Barbiturates speed up the metabolism of digitalis-type drugs , which are critical within a narrow range . Even a modest overdose may precipitate a dangerous , abnormal heart rhythm . <P> Precise drug dosages for individuals are undoubtedly years off , for Kalman 's is a counsel of pharmacological perfection . Nonetheless , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goldstein and Lewis Aronow , have given it considerable impetus with their exhaustive , 884-page study , Principles of Drug Action ( Hoeber Medical Division of Harper &; Row ) . The differences among patients in their reactions to drugs may be caused by race , individual heredity , personal idiosyncrasy , or allergic reaction . Enzyme deficiencies and abnormal hemoglobins are found among Negroes and some Mediterranean peoples . In as many as 10% of Negro males , normal doses of the antimalarial drug primaquine will precipitate an acute and potentially fatal blood-destroying anemia . Many individuals with this peculiarity are almost equally sensitive to sulfas and several other drugs . <P> One of the common drug reactions involves isoniazid , the most widely used drug against tuberculosis . One of the rarer reactions is found among victims of porphyria ( see following story ) , who suffer acute attacks if they take barbiturates ; they may also be sensitive to the sulfas . At the opposite end of the reaction scale , some victims of an unusual form of rickets need more than 1,000 times the normal quantity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
