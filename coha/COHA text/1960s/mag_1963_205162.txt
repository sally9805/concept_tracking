The U.S. photo reconnaissance jet swooped over Cuba , darted from point to point with whirring cameras . Offshore were four escort fighters , their jets snarling angrily , their young pilots spoiling for a fight . <P> On the ground . Soviet and Cuban crews scrambled for their antiaircraft missiles . <P> Their radio network crackled alive-and the voices were heard in the U.S. planes . Cuban commanders pleaded for permission to shoot down the photo plane . But there were more authoritative voices , speaking in Spanish and Russian . " Hold your fire . ' ' they ordered . ' ' Hold your fire . Do n't shoot . " The Cubans obeyed their Soviet masters and the U.S. planes , their mission completed , flew safely away . <P> All this happened just a few days ago . And it served to stress one of the most curious facts of the Cuba crisis : that though the Soviet missile buildup in Cuba brought the world close to war last October , the presence of Soviet forces there may now have some peacekeeping advantages . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yet it is Soviet authority that presently restrains Castro 's trigger-happy gunners from trying to stop them . <P> This bewildering combination of circumstances has an inhibiting effect on U.S. policy toward Cuba . There are people in the Administration who regard the Soviet presence with some equanimity , and even argue that it is necessary to take Khrushchev 's sensibilities into account , and to understand that having already lost face in the Communist bloc by his missile withdrawal , he can not afford to lose more by pulling his troops out under U.S. pressure . Khrushchev promised to withdraw them in " due course . " and last week President Kennedy instructed Ambassador Foy Kohler to find out . in no combative way . what the Russians regard as " due course . " The Administration hopes that Khrushchev will eventually call most of his troops home on his own volition . But it is hard to see why he would , and the Administration is under mounting U.S. criticism for its failure to force Khrushchev out of Cuba . <P> President Kennedy conceded at his press conference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to train Cubans to export revolution and sabotage throughout Latin America . Moreover , by one White House estimate , at least 13,000 students from other Latin American nations are in Castro 's Communist schools ; about 100 graduate agents leave Cuba monthly to cause trouble back home . The tacit bargain with Khrushchev may have its advantages for the U.S. , but it has them for Khrushchev too .
