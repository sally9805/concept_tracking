The Chauffeur Sir : <P> Thank you for the enormously kind way you described my ride at the Washington horse show Nov. ' 3 . Actually it was a very nice horse , and if he 'd had any kind of a chauffeur up on him at all , he 'd have done pretty well . Anyway , Bobby says if I can be referred to as the onetime scourge of the equestrian East , give him five more years and he 'll be All-American . <P> ETHEL KENNEDY McLean , Va . <P> City Planning Sir : <P> Bravo to Mrs. Jacobs for bringing to light the truth about " slum areas " and housing developments Nov. 10 . For one who has lived in the Back Bay area of Boston and who is now living in the " never-never " land of married student housing , I welcome Mrs. Jacobs ' arguments with open arms . How 1 would love to once again dodge people , taxis and cigarette butts for a " corn beef on rye " in a cozy basement delicatessen . Until such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentenced to live in the bleak " hells " called housing projects . <P> KAREN WILLARD Ann Arbor , Mich . <P> Sir : <P> Critic Jacobs is reminiscent of a middle-aged woman calling to mind the numerous penny sweets of her childhood ; the higher-priced candy of today is better , but the sugars remembered are best . The development areas of today give the second-class citizen a better chance to succeed in the modern world , which is based on respectability . Congratulation , not reproach , is in order for the men responsible . <P> JAMES A. MCKENNA III Chevy Chase , Md . <P> Sir : <P> Anti-Planner Jacobs is capitalizing on common dissatisfactions via malicious attacks . Professional planners , who are thoroughly trained in the social and behavioral sciences , share her concern . Most of Jacobs ' slanted facts are correct , but her whipping boy-should be the quacks , who parade as public or private planners because they have funds to invest or can bend over a drawing board . <P> Portions of our cities are poorly planned because sterile architects and second-rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professional planners . <P> PETER H. NASH Cincinnati <P> The Three Keeps <P> Sir : <P> Mary Bunting convinced me . With two children and good prospects for a third . I accepted a tutoring position the morning after reading TIME 'S cover story Nov. 3 . <P> Thanks for the push ! <P> MARLVS A. PETERSON Minnesota ' 56 Sheboygan , Wis . <P> Sir : <P> " Amen " to Mrs. Bunting ! <P> American women who fail to appreciate their respected role in society ought to be shipped off to Australia to observe women here in the role of the " three keeps " : keep the house clean , keep husband happy , and keep quiet . <P> MARY CHARLOTTE BAYLES Canberra , Australia <P> Sir : <P> I have three daughters of my own , as well as three sons , and am most interested in education , especially for girls . The attitude of so many mothers that it is only necessary to provide further education for their sons incenses me .
