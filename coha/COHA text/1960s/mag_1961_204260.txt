Ho ! Ho ! Ho ! <P> " Haah ? " grunted shoppers as they pounded their way into thickening throngs that filled the stores . " Ooops ! " they said , and " Oof ! " " Aughh ! " and sometimes " Bah ! " and sometimes " Oooh ! " <P> These are some of the tones in the season of sounds . There are others : the soaring nobility of Handel 's Messiah ; the cheerful beauty of carols that somehow sound best in the snow outside somebody 's front door at night ; the tinkling bells on the live sheep in the village crche , and the clink of coins in the kettles set up for the poor ; the thousand different squeals of joy that children invent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obbligato to that great rite of Christmastide , the buying and giving of gifts .

In officially atheistic Russia , where the authorities frown upon the " bourgeois " tradition of Christmas , citizens still crowd into department stores and exchange gifts around the " New Year 's trees " while children babble about " Grandfather Frost . " In Hindu India , gifts and greetings are exchanged , and on Christmas Day the shops close and liquor prohibitions are relaxed . In Islamic Morocco , seven-year-old Princess Amina , daughter of the late King Mohammed V , will give a Santa Claus party for 2,000 children and present them all with gifts . In Japan , whose 700,000 Christians account for only .0075 of the population , canny retailers are decorating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a splurge of holiday purchases .
