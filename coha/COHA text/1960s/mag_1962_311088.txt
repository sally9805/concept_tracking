After the easy , articulate warmth of its own astronaut . Colonel John Glenn , the U.S. was surprised last week by the somewhat uncommunicative attitude of Russian Cosmonaut Gherman Stepanovich Titov . Sent to the U.S. to share his hard-won knowledge of travel in space with Glenn and COSPAR ( Committee on Space Research ) , Titov seemed under orders from home to do nothing of the sort . In press conferences and TV interviews , he was always guarded and reluctant in his replies , though often breezy enough when it came to enjoying the crowds . <P> Problems Enough . Most of Titov 's tour was anything but scientific . Rushed around New York City , he was booed by floor traders at the Stock Exchange and replied that he had better things to do than to work in such a place . While visiting the U.N. , he was asked by U.S. Ambassador Adlai Stevenson whether he thought the whole Security Council could be transported to the moon . He quickly fell in with the Stevensonian gag . " Are n't there enough problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked , and got a laugh . <P> In Washington , Titov and his buxom wife Tamara joined John and Mrs. Glenn for a frantic tour of the capital . They were chivied from conference to conference by mobs of reporters , photographers and keening teenagers . ( " My God , " cried one photographer , " it was Sinatra all over again ! " ) The Glenns showed the visitors the standard sights ( Smithsonian , Washington Monument , Lincoln Memorial , etc. ) and took the Titovs to the White House for a brief , formal call on President Kennedy . <P> Always Perfect . Finally Titov had to face up to the official reason for his trip to Washington : his address before COSPAR . Listeners who hoped that they would hear a Glenn-type account of the Russian 's 25 hours in orbit were disappointed . Titov 's formal , apparently ghostwritten speech described the Vostok II 's equipment only in the most general terms . Even when figures were given , they were carefully selected to tell little . Titov revealed , for instance , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liquid-propellant rocket engines with 600,000 kilograms ( 1,323,000 Ibs. ) of total thrust . Without breakdown into stages , this information told U.S. scientists little that they had not already calculated for themselves . The same was true of Titov 's revelation that , against instructions , he left the Vostok II 's portholes uncovered during re-entry and saw flame and molten material from the heat shield wash over them . His predecessor , Yuri Gagarin , had done the same thing . Titov also disclosed , not very informatively , that he had controlled his craft himself during two of his 17 orbits . <P> Everything about Titov 's ride went perfectly , of course , as is always the case with Russian-described flights of Russian-designed equipment . But if U.S. scientists want to know how a space traveler feels after more than three orbits of the earth , they will have to wait until they have sent one of their own astronauts on the trip .
