MITCHELL sat in the green painted gazebo that stood in the far corner of her great-aunt 's lawn , the corner overlooking the Gulf . She had been there most of the afternoon , playing one game of solitaire after the other , shuffling the cards in fancy river-boat gambler fashion . Now she stopped her game to watch a rainstormmove up out of the Gulf . She had been aware of it for some time . Even without looking she had felt its approach , had felt a change , that was really little more than a quiver in the air . She tossed the cards aside ; some of them slid across the table and dropped to the floor . She glanced after them but did n't bother picking them up . She turned and knelt on the padded bench that linedp4the octagonal house and peered through an opening in the crisscross lattice that formed the walls . Beyond the gazebo , some thirty or forty feet of slow slope , was the low iron fence that edged the property . Beyond that the ground dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Gulf . She could see the rain , a grey haze like smoke , at DolphinIsland , some five miles off shore . She could smell it now too , the wonderful exciting smell of coming rain . The quiver in the air grew stronger . The island disappeared in the haze . And the little tendrilsof Virginia creeper that streaked the outside of the trellis began to shiver slightly . Joan got an extra pillow and shoved it behind her knees and settled down to watch . In ten minutes the first drops came , big tadpoleshapeddrops that plopped and exploded with sharp , distinctsounds . And then the rain itself  --  windless sheets , straight down , luminous grey , fish-colored . The roof began to leak . She counted the places , three , four , and some bubbles near the edge that would soon be a steady drain . She glanced over her shoulder and saw a little stream pour down on the cards . She saw a jack of diamondsjump and shiver . There was the smell of settling dust now , and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hisses . The small rain , she thought . And the poem she had read only last night came popping into her head :  |p5O  western wind , when wilt thou blow That the small rain down can rain ? Christ , that my love were in my arms And I in my bed again ! It was such a silly thing to think of . " Damn , " she said aloud . Reading too much . When there was nothing else to do . Nothing but sit . When talking was too much trouble . And your body was so light and hollow that you wondered sometimes whether the wind would get inside it , behind it , and blow it over and over . It was so light , it was so dry . . . . Joan held out her hand and looked at it , and she felt a little tingle of surprise . It was n't dry or withered , but it felt that way ... . " Damn , " she said aloud again . It was n't making sense . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , before you get into orbit . She looked at her body , carefully . It was round and plump ( I 've been eating too much , she thought ) and tanned a dark brown . Water was dripping on her head . She lifted one hand , absent-mindedly . Then jumped . And giggled . And moved aside , settling down finally in a dry spot . The squall passed over slowly . On the other side the sun was bright and hard and the sky was brilliant cloudlessblue . There was a burst of traffic on the highway below her.  |p6The  rain would have held them up , and now they 'd be driving like crazy to catch even . And who would they be , she thought , the people in those cars  --  kids from the air base , most likely , she answered herself . Thin-faced kids in grey uniforms , heading for New Orleans on a week-end pass . And other people going into the city for something  --  a game maybe . There was always some sort of athletics on week ends . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her mother , Aurelie , would be on the road . Coming to take her back to New Orleans . Of course . She lived there . She had always lived there . In the house on Coliseum Street . She had been born there twenty years ago . Her great-great-grandfather built that house , way back a long time ago , she 'd forgot just how long , but one year when the price of sugar was high . It was her mother 's house now . It was Aurelie Calllet'shouse . ( She always thought of her mother as Aurelie Caillet , always by her maiden name . ) And someday it would pass to her , Joan Mitchell . Because she was the oldest ... . She did n't want to go home . Maybe because she had the funniest feeling that the house was n't real , was n't there at all . Nor the people in it . . . . She felt different here on the coast . Not happy , perhaps . But sure . She had n't been this sure since she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small dark room , its air laced by the carbolic smell of bindings and the sweet odor of mildew , and in a little secretary , carefully locked againstp7the children , the family-written books : one or two on law , three volumes of travel , some of devotion , one of poetry ) and had puzzled over a big globe , turning it carefully around and around until she found the spot she wanted . She put her finger on it and said aloud : " I am here . Right here . " Years later , one evening  --  just last year  --  when she 'd felt particularly confused , she 'd remembered and gone back to the globe . And turned it and looked at it . But it was n't the same . The names of the countries were different . All the possessions were different . And though she 'd stood looking at it for a long time it did n't do any good . She felt that way in the house on Coliseum Street . Maybe it was because her four half-sisters lived there too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a daughter by each husband . Joan had to stop sometimes and figure out just whose father was who . When she was little she 'd even had trouble rememberingher sisters ' last names . On the coast the air seemed lighter and clearer , especially when a wind blew from across the Gulf . Even now , in September . She remembered New Orleans . The close windless heat of a river town . The swamp smell after the daily rain . The oleander bushes with their glossy thriving poisonous leaves . The grass and vines that grew so franticallyyou could see them move  --  the way you could see the heavy white moonflowers open on summer nights ,  |p8the  way they unfolded in the heat , stretching until their backs were broken and they flopped open and died . And the sky was like a teacup fitted overhead , close and hard and shiny as china . But she lived there . In the house on Coliseum Street . She was Joan Claire Mitchell , daughter of Aurelie Caillet and Anthony Mitchell . She had been baptized that way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her name was written on the back of the cross on her crystal rosary . Somewhere . She had put that away the morning she came back from the confirmation ceremony , wearing her white taffeta dress and long white stockings , and her veil like a bride 's on her head . She had taken everything , including her specially made slip , all tucks and embroidery , folded them in a box and put the cover on . She did not look at them again . She had not even thought about them until today . More cars swooped by on the road , weaving , tooting madly . In one of them , she thought , Aurelie will be coming over . To take me back . I could have taken the train . Or maybe she did n't think I would take the train by myself . Maybe she thought the only way to get me back was to come get me . . . . But that is n't fair . It 's mean , and it is n't fair at all . I must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's been real great . For sure . All through the mess . There would n't be many mothers 'd take it like that . Not a complaint . Just a little finger tapping silence . And a trip to thep9window to stare out , even though the outside blinds were closed tight and bolted against the hot afternoon sun . Just a question . Only one : " How long has it been ? " Two and a half , nearly three , months . Then another close inspection of the closed blinds . " It will have to be done at once . I 'll call Aunt Ethel . You can stop there . Over at the Pass . " She remembered every word . Even the way her mother said stop for stay . And she remembered how relieved she 'd been when she no longer had to figure things out alone . Her mother did not even bother asking her . She went ahead and arranged . Not many others , Joan thought , would have taken it like that . The cards on the table were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She gathered them up and wiped them on her skirt . She pressed them together between her fingers , trying to get the layers of paper to stick together . She sat very still , listening as she had come to do over these past weeks . Listening to the caverns of emptiness inside her . Listening to her heart beat out , echoing in the arches of bone and flesh . The empty arches . She felt so light . Her feet just brushed the ground . She reached out one hand and held fast to the doorjamb so she should n't float away up and out of reach . She stood and watched her fingers holding on . Until a littlep10brown lizard ran up the frame and crossed over her knuckles . And she felt his hard scurrying little feet . She heard the sound she had been waiting for , the sound that stood out above the noisy dripping of the leaves , and the steady sucking of the sandy ground , and the fluttering of the birds . The sound of tires on the graveled drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . She took the cushions and piled them all together on one corner of the bench . She would have to bring them in . The dew would leave them blotched with black mold by morning . A couple of blue jays came to peck at the lawn , their feathers brilliant and glossy as they stabbed about in the blades of grass . And her aunt 's old woman 's voice called over the dripping garden : " Joan ! Company for you ! " " I 'll be right there . " She gathered the cushions in her arms and started back . There were so many , they were piled so high , that she could not see the ground over them . Somehow she got off the brick path and was walking over the soaking soggy grass . She shrugged and kept on walking . She even remembered a little tune to hum under her breath as she went . She saw Aurelie first . But then you always saw Aureliefirst  --  saw her tall thin figure and great head , heavyp11head , with masses of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a face with clear high cheekbones like an Indian , a hooked Creole nose , and large dark brown eyes streaked with bright yellow . Aurelie was hugging her : " Child , you 're brown as a berry ! " And over her shoulder Joan 's eyes were looking for the other figure she had known would be there . She found him finally : Fred Aleman . He kissed her politely on the cheek . She caught a quick smell of starch and shaving lotion . His shoulder felt good to her hand  --  solid , strong . He was more handsome than she had remembered  --  tall , heavy , with olive skin and straight black hair . " Fred , " she said , " I 'm so glad you came . " " My pleasure , ma'am . " He was mocking her gently , smiling , and she felt the way she always did with him  --  familiar , comfortable as if she had always known him . Standing there with the two of them , she found it hard to believe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to the house on ColiseumStreet . Like all the others on that street the house was narrowand three stories tall , white painted and black shuttered . The first two floors had porches straight across the front , narrow porches edged and ornamented with light lacy ironwork . A slender delicate house of the sort that had been popular in the 1840 's . In front was a tiny lawn divided exactly in two by a brick walk and edged by the scrolls and feathers of a low iron fence . In one of those smooth tiny patches of grass , misplaced and hideous , was a fountain , a bubbling fountain . Its tile basin was mottled with garish blue and yellow mosaics of fish and shells . In its center stood a young mermaid , a pitcher spilling water over her shoulder . From the sides of the circle four bronze dolphins spat short streams of water at her feet . Her father 's fountain . . . . Anthony Mitchell had built it during the year he had lived in the house , the single year of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched over its construction carefully . He had protected it in his divorce settlement . He had protected it even more securely in his will . The fountain would stay . Aurelie 's regular  --  and very large  --  monthly check depended on it . " The neighborhood looks the same , " Joan said . " Did you expect a change ? " Aurelie asked . " I guess not . " Joan asked : " Are the kids home ? " " My dear , " Aurelie said , " you really have lost track of time . Only Doris . The others are at camp . " " Oh , " Joan said . " Of course . How silly of me . " She scarcely saw her three youngest sisters . They were away at school , they were away at camp . She saw them only on holidays . When they were all children , when the youngest was no more than three , they had a song to sing on those days . A song made up of their names that they sang to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Doris , Phyllis , Celine , Ann . Aurelie 's friends were tremendously impressed . It sounded really very nice . . . . " The same house , " Aurelie was saying , " and the same people in it ! " The tiny fountain winked at Joan as they went up the front walk . The brilliant yellow tiles gleamed even in the half light of the evening . Fred took her suitcase into the hall and put it at the foot of the stairs . Joan put her train case beside it . She asked : " Do n't you think we could have a drink ? " Aurelie 's eyebrows went up in mock horror . " Andp14you , my dear ? " she said to Fred . " ' Will you join us ? " As she spoke , she had already slipped an arm through his and was leading him into the living room . Joan followed . The living room was on the east side  --  the shady side  --  of the house , but even so the blinds were kept shut . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air moving . But it was cool . A damp cool coming from the large tubs of fern that were fitted carefully into the corners off the edges of the rug . " A gin and tonic would be nice , do n't you think ? " Aurelie opened the old-fashioned secretary that had been turned into a bar . She mixed the drinks swiftly with all the assurance of a professional bartender . She fixed a plain tonic for herself ; she did not drink . Alcohol , she said , made lines in women 's faces much too early . She preferred to miss the exhilaration and save her face . She wrapped the glasses , which had immediately started to drip in the damp heavy air , in little embroiderednapkins . " You know , " she said , " great-uncle Henry would just die if he could see what we have done with his secretary . He was a teetotaler , you know . " " That 's right , " Fred said . " He was , was n't he ? " He knows that as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rush of fierceness . He is only saying it because she would like him to . He 's always doing what other people want him to do , to make them feel better . Fred was sitting on the little rosewood sofa now , thep15one that had just been reupholstered in a tapestry designof diamonds and flowers . He was saying politely : " I 've never had the chance to look him up , not in any complete way . Not the way I want to . He was a remarkable man , and I know something about him , of course . A pioneer . A man of real vision . " Joan heard Aurelie 's voice making some answer , but she closed her ears and talked angrily to herself . Horse shit , she told herself , he did n't do anything . Except get to be governor on bought votes during the Reconstruction . And live to be eighty . And make a little money on sugar cane . And survive a couple of depressions . And outlive all his children . And see his great-grandchildren get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Dear child , " Aurelie was saying , " you are sitting there with a frightfulfrown on your pretty face . And you are talking to yourself in a most animated fashion . " The edge in the tone warned her . She certainly did not want to endure her mother 's temper . " I am sorry , " Joan said . " A car trip always leaves me a little groggy and far away . " " The drink would help , " Fred said gently . He 's heard that note in her voice too , she thought . It 's sweet of him to give me a way out . He was talking to her mother again . I wonder , Joan thought , does she know that he does n't hear a word she 's saying , that he 's watching me ? That he 's worrying about me , wondering if there 's anything wrong ?  |p16And  in spite of herself she felt a little shiver of excitement  --  theshiver that was a mixture of gratitude and attraction toward a man . Why not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lookingand I 'm not old . I 'm supposed to like it . He 's a nice guy and handsome , except for his ears . Of course . And it 's lovely to have somebody wondering about you . She had been thinking more slowly than she realized . More time must have passed than she knew , because it was Fred who finally turned to her with a smile and said : " Come back , little Joan . " She jumped in her chair , as if somebody had touched her , and looked very guilty . Aurelie chuckled . Lay back her large head and laughed aloud , a robust laugh that clashed sharply with her tinkling speech . Joan blushed , feeling very silly . " I 've been alone a lot this summer , " she said , " and I suppose I got in the habit of talking to myself . " " We were just teasing , " Fred said . " My dear , you looked so silly , " Aurelie said . Then Joan was furious with herself for trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said fiercely and silently . And I do n't have to explain anything at all . Not one thing . She stood up and this time she said aloud : " I suppose I am tired . I really should lie down awhile . " She was at the door before she realized that Fred was talking to her . " What ? "  | " I thought we were going to dinner  --  or would you rather not ? " Why so patient ? Why was he always so kind ? " Mother will go with you , " Joan said , deliberately using a word Aurelie disliked . " I 'm fine right here . " Fred shrugged . ( How Cajun he looks when he does that , Joan thought . ) " I had hoped ... " " Silly boy , " Joan said , " Mother would love to go . And I promise not to be a bit jealous . " She turned up the stairs , grabbing the little train case as she went , hurrying so she would not be tempted to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The same mahogany furniturewith the cracked dull finish , the result of years of careful oiling and long hot summers . The windows were closed , the whole bank of windows that faced east and dribbled light into her eyes every single morning of the world . Of her world . Nice old room , she found herself thinking . But that was n't possible . Ever since she was little she had wanted to get away . And the times she had actually been away  --  at camp or on a holiday  --  she had not missed it at all . Now , as she went about opening the windows and opening the screens and blowing the accumulation of gnats and moths out of the window sill , and shaking a faint film of dust off the organdy curtains , there was an ache in her chest that was an actual pain . How funny , she thought . How very funny . She turned back the covers on the bed and sniffed the musty odor of the sheets . No one had changed them . The room was n't touched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stretched out on the bed.  |p19She  listened to the last afternoon sounds , sounds she had been hearing ever since she was an infant . The yellingof children playing Devil on the Banquette in the shade of the thick old camphor trees across the street . ... They said the trees were planted as a protection against fever , that if you had a camphor tree outside your house and wore some of the aromatic berries in a little cloth bag around your neck along with a little voodooskin bag , you did n't get yellow fever . But just in case you did , you planted a sweet olive tree by the front gate . So that people coming in for funerals could break off a sprig of the waxy heavy sweet flowers  --  the tree was always in bloom  --  and carry it into the parlor where the corpse was . . . . It must have come in handy on the long hot summer days , she thought . . . . The sweet olive by the front gate of the house on Coliseum Street was enormous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so very slowly . Dead man 's bush . Aurelie hated it , but she did n't do anything about it . I 'd hire me a couple of Negroes with an ax and a saw , Joan thought , and get it cut down . None of this waiting around and putting off and sitting back and saying you 're going to do something . Me , I 'd go right ahead and get it done . Even as she said that to herself , she did n't believe it . The slow windless dusk was getting to her , seeping in until the sharp decisive lines were gone , and nothing was really too important . She got up and took off her slip and bra and pantiesp20and lay clown naked and felt the soft warmth all around her , the air that was heavy and thick and soft as water . The children stopped playing and went home to rest beforesupper . An old-clothes man passed by with his wagon and clanking bell that shook out flat sounds into the evening . I should n't have come back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhere . But I did n't . I wonder why I did n't . I 'm back and caught just where I was four months ago . Where I said I would n't ever be again . I came back , I came back . Whatever happens , I did it . Something else came out of the soft bright dusk , a lonesome twitching that was n't so much physical as it was emotional . And it 's worse . Because I did n't love Michael then , but I love him now . And how did that happen ? I did n't love him last June . Not even the day we went hunting for the stuffed owls . . . . Last June . That was when it started . Way back . Four months ago . On a close hot morning last June.  |p23COLISEUM  STREET was quiet . There was no traffic , there never was . The houses always looked closed and deserted , their galleries dusty and empty . No one ever walked by . The sidewalks  --  the banquettes , people on Coliseum Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the roots of the oaks and camphors and magnolias that shaded the street and turned its surface into a slippery sludge when it rained . Only occasionally a wino or a mainliner would come stumbling along , straying from the slums a dozen blocks or so away , over by the levees that guarded the river . And then , routinely , one of the householders would telephone the police . The police came quickly too , not because the people along the street had very much money ( they did n't ; the houses were slightly shabby and always a couple of seasonsbehind in their paint ) but because they were persistentand noisy and had large families of cousins and aunts and uncles who were vaguely connected with the city government . And because generations past , thep24owners of the houses had been rich . The memory of wealth is still a kind of power in New Orleans . That particular morning , a Tuesday , the second of June , one of the strays entered the street . He stood for awhile at the corner , squinting into the leafy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ block , stopping again to squint up at the trees , taking off his old felt hat and wiping his face with it . The street closed up on itself , like a doodlebug rolling into a ball . The houseboy who had been hosing down the front walk at the Forstalls left his hose , pausing only to turn off the water , and disappeared around the back . The Edwards ' maid , a tall skinny black woman who had spent most of the morning sweeping and cleaning the front porch so that she could see who was entertainingfor lunch , flicked back into the door with only a switch of her yellow uniform . A nurse came and got the Villere girl who was playing in her swing in the side yard of the corner house . She yanked her out of the swing without a word and carried her off screaming and kicking . All down the street the windows that looked out on the front porches ( the windows that were nearly always kept open for a cross breeze ) were closing . There was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind was blowing . But of course it was n't . There was never a wind in the middle of a June morning . The man had put his hat back on his head now , and he moved along . The uneven sidewalks with their sharpp25angles seemed to bother him . He stumbled and swayed once and steadied himself with a hand to the trunk of an oak tree . He went a bit farther , then fell over the broken pavement . He did not seem to try to get up . He was then directly in front of the Caillet house . His outflung hand was a few inches away from the wrought-iron pillar that supported the iron gate . Inside the house , people were watching . No one had told them to , no one had to . They had simply happened to look out . Joan Mitchell stood in the upstairs front hall  --  she had opened one of the shutters  --  and watched . She squinted and craned her neck forward . It was very hard to see from this angle . Through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed putty colored , seemed to fade into the concrete walk . The still sunny minutes passed . You could almost hear them clacking by like a metronome . Mockingbirds in the big oak began to screech and fight . " For heaven 's sake , child ! " Joan jumped and turned guiltily . Her mother had come up behind her . " Close the window , you silly child ! " Aurelie was wearing a robe of silky purple-flowered print . She never got dressed before ten . " Close the window , child , " she repeated . " Do n't be so silly . " " Not way up here . " " Honestly , there are times when I just do n't know what to think of you . "  | " I 'm twenty feet up , " Joan said . " Really , now ... " " I was listening . He was saying something . " " Do n't listen to him . " " I think he 's saying water . Or something like that . " Aurelie folded her arms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extremely angry . " My dear girl , " she said , " if you would stop being such an obstinate silly little ass , you would not resemble your father so much . " Joan shrugged and went back to her watching . " As a man , " Aurelie said , " he was entitled to do silly things if he wished . Perhaps . " Her arm reached around Joan and closed the window . " Behave like six , get treated like six . " The arms folded . " I 'll stay right here until the police come . " " What do you suppose they do with them ? " Joan asked . " How on earth should I know ? " " You hear about the way they handle them . " " Do n't be such a silly child . " Joan pushed her nose against the shirred curtain that covered the glass and tried to see . But the glass in the window was old and wavy and the image was distorted beyond recognition . Still , with her mother there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joan breathing in the softly fragrant dust of the cloth . It seemed a very , very long time . When the police had gone , and the windows all along Coliseum Street had opened up again , Joan went outp27the front door and looked down at the broken spot of banquette where the man had been . She almost expected to find something . A shadow left behind . But there was nothing . Only the greyish cement with its pebbly underside showing through the widest cracks . She stood awhile , waiting . But nothing happened . The Villere girl twisted the swing up tightly , then sat and whirled with it , was dizzy , and vomited in the dusty azalea bed . He called that same morning . Joan did not recognize his voice . " It 's Michael Kern , " he said . " Oh , " she said , " oh goodness yes . " She had seen him only a half dozen times , the last when he had come to the house on Coliseum Street to date her sister Doris , who at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you go out with me tonight ? " he asked abruptly . " I 'm not Doris , " she said . " She 's gone out some-where . " " To hell with Doris , " he said . " I 'm asking you if you have a date tonight . " It was a Tuesday and Fred Aleman , her steady , alwayswent to the Athletic Club to play handball on Tuesday nights . So he would not be coming by . " Do n't get angry , " he said , " I just thought that when I met you at your house , I just thought you might want to go out with me . " It was n't much of an invitation , Joan thought . It was n't anything of an invitation.  |p28She  still had n't said anything . " Well , " he said finally , puzzled by the silence , " you ca n't shoot a man for trying . And if you were n't doing anything I thought it might be fun to go out to the lake for crabs and beer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't expect the Blue Room on my salary ? " " No , " she said , " no , of course not . " Talk about money always embarrassed her . He laughed . " I guess the whole thing does sound kind of funny . " She would read that evening , on the back porch , and watch mosquitoes bump and buzz into the screen , and watch the big moths that came out every night for the moonflowers . If she got tired of that she could walk over to St. Charles Avenue and catch a streetcar and ride around the belt , making a big circle and getting off at her own stop forty minutes later . ( It never occurred to her to call up any of the girls she knew  --  she did not particularly like them . She had never been too popular with men and since Fred was so obviously courting her , she got almost no calls for dates any more . ) " As a matter of fact , " she said , " I 'm not busy to-night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and got out the special shampoo with the extra nice scent , the one she had been saving for the past two months . She rinsed her hair with vinegar to bring out the red lights , then shampooed and set it very carefully.  |p29She  went out in the back yard and sat in the sun to wait for it to dry . She had been there an hour or so when her halfsisterDoris came out . Joan shut her eyes and pretended she was asleep . Doris came over and stood in front of her . " Come on . Quit pretending . " Joan opened her eyes and yawned . " I did n't hear you . " The hell you did n't . " Doris was wearing a sweat-stained T shirt and a pair of dirty white shorts . They were as short as were allowed on the courts at Audubon Park . She was taller than Joan and more slightly built . ( They looked a good deal alike  --  more like full sisters than half-sisters  --  but then all the girls of the family favored their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brown hair , blue eyes , fair skin that freckled in the sun . Doris was beautiful . She was blond , her short cropped hair bleached whitish by the sun and an occasional application of peroxide . Her face was rounder than her half-sister 's , she had a cleft chin , and her nose was a smaller version of the sharp pinched Creole beak of her mother and sister . She did not bother with make-up or lipstick in the mornings . Her tanned skin gleamed with sweat ; it was flawless , not a blemish or a mark . Her eyes were heavily lashed and naturally shadowed . They were great lustrousbrown eyes  --  just about the only things she hadp30from her father , Raul Bringier . He had been a very handsome Cuban , and he had left Aurelie one day , sayingsimply that he was tired of speaking English all the time . Joan thought with a twinge : she 's golden and shiny , like a Christmas tree ornament . " Come off it , old duck , " Doris said . " Make sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going out with the great Michael Kern . " " He called , " Joan said . " How did you know ? " " A little bird . " " Aurelie ? " " Sure . " She often listened on the upstairs extension . Joan had complained and screamed and ranted , but Aurelie had paid no attention . " It 's an old habit , dear , " she said simply . " From the time when I was married to Doris 's father . I could n't possibly get over it at my age now . " " She should n't have told you . " " Maybe she does n't like date-stealers either . " " But he said he was n't going with you any more , " Joan lied . " He said you had a fight . " " I would n't be caught dead with that bastard . " " So what 's the fuss ?

" If I wanted him you would n't get him . " " Do n't be so dramatic , little sister . " For one moment she thought Doris would swing at her with the tennis racket she held in her left hand . But that moment passed , and Doris only gave a short vicious chop at a wasp that was drowsing on the top of the waxy white butterfly lilies . Then she stamped into the house.  |p32HE  was on time , almost to the minute . Joan was standing at the head of the stairs  --  she had been standing there motionless for at least five minutes  --  waiting for the bell . She went down slowly , setting her feet firmly , telling herself not to hurry or be flustered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't really remember what he looked like . And if I do n't even recognize him . . . I 'll just die , she thought . That 's all there is to it . She stopped dead still on the bottom step . Her knees felt strange and she sat down . And I just ironed the dress . . . . The doorbell rang again . She got up and walked toward the door , her glance trailing along the floor . She noticed that where the polished boards met the wall there was a little layer of fluffy dust . Aurelie wouldp33have a fit if she saw that , she thought . It 's strange that she did n't . She must be getting old .. . . She recognized him at once . She would have known him anywhere . He was tall , but not very , and slight and small boned . He had black hair and fair skin and a very pronounced bluish beardline . " Hi , " she said , " you 're the promptest man I 've ever known . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . " He hesitated , his hand on the door . " Why do n't we go right on ? " Is it Doris he 's thinking of ? she wondered . Because he does n't want to meet her ? Or because he does and is afraid to ? But she only said : " I left my purse upstairs . I 'll get it and be right back . " She went as quickly as she could in her heels on the polished floors . She gave her nose one dab with a puff , checked to be sure there was no lipstick on her teeth , then clattered down again . He was snubbing out a cigarette in a standing pot of maidenhair fern . He saw her glance . " The nicotine 's good for them  --  I hope . " " I 'm sure it is . " He had a Ford convertible , a few years old . " You want the top up ? " " No , " she said , though she would have preferred it.  | " That makes you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Most would be screaming for it up before they stepped out of the house . " " I can comb my hair . " They drove through the heavy evening traffic until they got to the narrow bumpy road that led to the lake . He was very quiet ; he seemed to be concentrating on his driving . As they were passing along the lake canal with its little protecting levees , she said finally , for want of anything else : " My grandfather built that . " He turned and looked at her . " Built what ? " " The canal . " " I thought soldiers built it during the Civil ' War . " " Are you sure ? " " Are you ? " The talk seemed so stupid to her suddenly that she wished she had kept quiet . " It 's just a story they tell in my family , " she said flatly . " That 's all . " It was called Ruby 's Place and it was built the way all Pontchartrain fishing camps were built  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A narrow white painted gangway led to the main building some hundred feet offshore . Joan and Michael walked along it slowly , squinting in the glare , listening to the steady gentle sucking of water beneath them , noticing how the creosoted pilings left thick layers of tar smell hanging in the air . The camp was simply a platform with a roof ,  |p35wra|p|ped  around with screening . It held a single large room , filled with tables ; the walls of a small kitchen cut across one corner . The floor boards banged and creaked uncertainly under their steps as they crossed to the west side to see the beginning of a sunset . " It 's going to be a lovely one , " Joan said . From this side of the camp another walk ( without railings this time and just three boards wide ) extended another hundred feet into the lake to a second platform set just above the water . This one was unscreened and empty , except for a clutter of wooden chairs and a few tables . " Oh let 's see out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish odor to the platform , and the unpainted wood had been bleached and grained and warped by the sun . " It 's a swell place to catch crabs , " Michael said . " Or neck . " " What would people do without the lake , " she mocked gaily . He smiled back at her and she saw that this time she had got just exactly the right tone in her voice . So that 's how it 's done , she thought ; well , I can do that as well as anyone else . And his eyes crinkle up when he smiles . " It would be easy to go in , " she said . " It 's happened . " " To you ? " " Yes , " he said . " I fell in once . "  | " What on earth were you doing ? " " Little lady , " he said , " do n't you go prying into my secret life . " She shrugged with elaborate carelessness . " Okay , man of mystery , buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk into the restaurant . Joan looked down at her feet following one another along the splintered boards . I could fall in too , she thought , but I wo n't let myself . The room was almost empty . Only one group  --  three couples  --  sat laughing at a corner table . A shirt-sleeved waiter was tearing yesterday 's date from the calendar that hung on the kitchen wall . Michael steered her to the farthest table , one on the lake side , right at the edge . There was no railing there at all . The screen was simply tacked under the floor . They could look down directly into the muddy shiveringwater . " Makes you think you 're sitting right in it , " Joan said . " Does n't it ? " They had a beer or two and looked out across the empty expanse of lake . Once a boy went past in a batteredskiff with a sputtering outboard on the stern . The ripples from his wake slapped against the pilings , briefly . The sun went down in a yellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . " How can you tell ? " " Just looks like it . "  |p37The  water turned a deep dusty orange . The camp was a growing black shadow on the little smooth waves . They pressed their noses against the screen , watching it lengthen and shift . " I guess you know a lot about the city , " he said . " No , I do n't . " " You 're from here . " " Oh sure . " " Then you know ... . Will you show me around some day ? " She felt a little pleasurable jolt . " It would be fun . " " We 'll do it . " The crabs came , red from boiling and brown-streaked with the seasoning spices and heaped on a chipped black Falstaff-beer tray . He pulled one out , flipped it over , brushed off the bits of ice and handed it to her . " Here , " he said . " A present . " " Thanks . " " What 's the matter ? " " Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She wondered if that was a joke of some sort . But she only said , " They taste alike . " " The roe , or the eggs or whatever you call it in crabs . " " You eat it ? " " Terrific  --  you never heard of that ? " She shook her head . " Maybe you do n't know so much about the city after all . "  | " I did n't say I did . That was your idea . " He took the crab back . " And if you want a guide , " she said huffily , " go down in the French Quarter and hire one . " He whistled through a crab leg . " What a temper ! " She did n't know what to think . And all of a sudden she remembered Fred and wondered if she would have to tell him that she had gone out with somebody else . And if she should tell him that it had n't been any fun and that she had wondered about him and wished she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the table . With the crabs and their dead black eyes staring at her . He had said something to her  --  she had not heard it . She folded her hands in her lap and said formally : " You think it is all very funny , but I am very sorry Icame . " He tossed the shell down into a pail on the floor and took a swallow of beer . " How come ? " " I am mostly sorry because I do n't know what to tell my fiance . " " Look , " he said , " I 've never raped anybody in my life . " " You do n't understand at all . I want to go home . " He studied her levelly . She wondered if her voice did not carry a note of conviction . " Do n't sound like a very silly schoolgirl . " He grinned at her , a wonderful wide grin that made his eyes crinkle and his ears move.  |p39She  found herself smiling back , a little shyly at first . And then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lap and into the shell pail . He got down on his hands and knees and pulled it out , stained and with littlepepper seeds sticking to it . He scrubbed at it with his napkin , then went back into the kitchen and worked at it with soap and water . It was dark when they left . She stumbled , her heel caught in one of the uneven boards . He took her arm , steadying her . " Watch , " he said . " We ca n't ruin the dress too . " He held her arm tightly , his knuckles just grazing her breast . His hand stayed there until they got to the road . Then he dropped it and walked a few steps ahead to open the car door . He did not touch her again and she decided that it had been an accident . He did not ask if she wanted to go home . He seemed to have forgotten that she had said it . " Do you like jazz ? " he asked . " Grew up on it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She never lied well . Aurelie had considered jazz something for the kitchen and the tourist-filled stretches of Bourbon Street . Her girls were brought up on Tchaikovskyand Ravel . " I thought we 'd try the Red House over in Gretna . " " Sure . " She had heard of that , of course . Doris had told her all about it . " Dick Wilson is there . "  |p40She  knew that name too , again from Doris . Why , she wondered , have I never gone there ? " I think that would be fun . " Perhaps something in her tone made him wonder . " You been there often before ? " " Not very often . " " It 's nice , " he said . " I know that . " It was a big barn of a place , crowded even on weekdaynights . They had to park two blocks away , at the edge of a deep drainage canal . " I bet the kids catch crawfish there in the spring , " Joan said . " I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . Look like roaches to me . " Oh , " Joan said , " sorry . " The closer they got to the building , the thicker the tangle of cars . Sometimes they had to retrace their steps because their way was blocked by cars bumper to bumper . Next to a white Mercury two men were having a violent argument over hooked fenders . As they passed , Michael whispered to her , " Can you understand a word ? " " Yes , " Joan said . The staccato nasal speech was pleasant and familiar . " For God 's sake . " " Just Cajun French . " " Oh sure , " Michael said . " I forgot about your mother . "  | " So did I , " Joan said softly . The people at the door seemed to know him , and Joan caught the little sidelong glances that were directedat her . They are comparing me to the other girls he 's brought in here , she thought . " You come in here a lot , do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " but a little . " They pushed their way inside to a table . Very soon Joan 's ears began to sting from the unaccustomed blare . The music was very loud and almost continuous . Every fifteen minutes  --  regular as a metronome  --  the band stopped . They got up , stretched and scratched , mopped their foreheads and shouldered their instruments . The second band was already climbing up . There was a brief silence while they arranged themselves . In the interval Joan and Michael exchanged a few crisp , disjointed words , hastily . " Watch the piano , " Michael told her once , " he 's ter-rific . " And every now and then , while the band belted out a piece , he would learn over and tap her arm , calling her attention to some particular aspect of the performance . She always nodded back , trying to look knowing , actuallyhaving not the slightest idea what he was telling her . They said very little . During the brief intermissions Michael usually dashed off to get more bottles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunched over the table ,  |p42frowning  with the effort of concentration . The music was far too loud to talk over anyhow . " I used to want to play like that , " he told her almost an hour later . " Want another beer ? " She shook her head . He did not get one for himself . He seemed to have had enough ; he seemed to have stopped drinking abruptly . " You know , " he smiled a crooked little smile , " all through high school and college I was crazy to play with a band . " " Why did n't you ? " He shook his head . She noticed that there was a little white trace of beer foam on his lip . " I do n't know why , " he said . " I wish I had , but there 's no living in that . " " They seem to be making a living . " She nodded toward the band . " They all have other jobs in the daytime , " he said . " Work like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I could n't do that , so I did n't try . . . . Just sometimes I wish I had . " The band began again , and he slumped forward into his listening crouch . Joan was wondering if she should suggest going somewhere else  --  and wondering how she could do that  --  when he said abruptly , in one of the brief spells of quiet : " Let 's go . " I 've not had a chance to talk to him at all , she thought . But he did n't seem to want to say anything.  |p43She  chattered on the way home , gaily , as Aurelie had trained her to do . He took her to the front steps  --  up the brick walk and past the tile fountain  --  and through the open windows she heard the little porcelain clock on the hall mantel striking eleven . Then she understood . She held out her hand . " Thank you very much , " she said , mechanically , " it was a very pleasant evening . " " And you 'll take me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said ; " you have n't got time . After all , it 's eleven , and you ca n't be too late , even to a late date . " Her back was to the light , and the soft glow , filtered through the lead glass , showed his face distinctly . So that she saw the quick flicker of surprise , the little start of guilt . She laughed out loud . A few feet away the little fountainseemed to echo her . " Dear boy , " she said in a clear imitation of Aurelie , " you did n't think I did n't know , did you ? " The flicker was gone . He recovered himself quickly . " You 're a witch , " he said gently . " Do have a splendid time , dear boy . . . . " And she slipped inside the door , closing it firmly behindher.  |p44THE  hall looked the way it always did at night . The mahogany table and the two carved lion's-head chairs were black and massive in the small yellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That lamp was so hideous  --  she had always hated it . It had had bead fringe once , and one rainy afternoon when she was a small girl  --  five or six or so  --  she had carefully worked away at it until the tiny glass beads were all pulled off and scattered to the corners of the room . When Aurelie saw it , she shrieked and clutched at her breast so that the little Joan began to laugh hysterically . Until Aurelie had taken her to the kitchen and spanked her  --  hardwiththe fly swatter . ( It was n't a new one either , she remembered ; there were still some black squashed flies imbedded in the screen wire . ) Then Aurelie dragged her back into the hall and made her watch while she got a brush and pan and went over the room on hands andp45knees , carefully collecting the beads . When she had done , and all the beads that were possibly there had been gathered up , she looked down at the small pile , mixed with dust in the pan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough . " You impossible child ! " For a minute Joan clutched her rear , thinking that they were going back for the fly swatter . Then the anger in Aurelie 's face changed slowly to horror . " You ate them , " she said softly . " You must have . " With a movement so fast that Joan was caught off balance , Aurelie grabbed her arm and carried her back to the kitchen . She forced her to swallow great hunks of soft white bread and drink glass after glass of water . There had been a doctor too , Joan remembered , but not very vividly . Funny , she thought , the things she rememberedbest always had something to do with her mother . .. . She went over and stood looking at the lamp closely . I still hate it , she said to herself , and would n't Aurelie be surprised if I pulled off all the fringe . . . . They were becoming fashionable again , she had to admit . Like the horrible iridescent Tiffany bud vase that stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good things are all down here or in Aurelie 's room , she thought . But I would n't have them in mine . ... As soon as I can spare the money I 'll do my room all over in blond wood and mirrors and black lacquer tables.  |p46And  I wonder who he is having the late date with . . . . Because it was an old habit , she went to the kitchen to see what was left in the icebox . There was only one light on . It was enough for her to make out Doris and a boy leaning head to head across the little kitchen table under the window . They did not move when she came in , but she felt their eyes roll over toward her . " Excuse me , " Joan said , " but I was going to the icebox . " The heads separated . " Hi , old duck , " Doris said in a vague voice . A tall thin blond boy stood up : " Good eve-ning . " " You remember Charles , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Joan said , though she did not . " This is my rich sister , " Doris said . " I 'll just check the icebox and be right out , " Joan said . " We were fixing supper , " Charles said . He sounded embarrassed . Joan found a piece of cheese and the heel of a loaf of French bread . She got an orange from the bowl on the window and dumped them all together in a single plate . " Did you have a fun time ? " Doris asked in her softest most southern voice . " No I did n't . " Joan was surprised to find herself tellingthe truth . So she went on . " I see what you mean  --  he is a creep . " Doris 's giggle followed her upstairs.  |p47Aurelie  was reading a magazine in the tiny study at the head of the stairs . She had done her hair up high on her head and tied it with a green ribbon , and she wore a taffeta housecoat that rustled with each breath she took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairs of dark mahogany and rosewood were soft and muted and motherly . Aurelie looked over the top of her magazine , and the taffeta rustled more loudly . " And how was your stolen tryst ? " " I wish everybody would just lay off me , " Joan said . " My dear child ... " " Will you please get Doris to stop calling me her rich sister ? " " My child , my child , " Aurelie said melodramatically , " only two of my girls at home , and they ca n't get on . " Oh shit ! " " I need not tell you what I think of that expression . " " I ca n't help it , " Joan said , " I get that from my fa-ther . " " Your father , " Aurelie said , and pulled off her glasses to polish them on her hem , " was extremely quiet and soft spoken . " " He was a gambler and a crook , " Joan persisted . " If he had n't died right when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those other people . " " Such a quiet dull man . " Aurelie was speaking gently to herself . " Who would have thought he 'd be such a very terribly dull man . "  | " Tell me one thing , " said Joan . " Did you marry him because he was rich ? " " Honestly , child .. " Why else ? " " He was a most intriguing man , " Aurelie said , " from a distance . " Joan remembered him so clearly she could n't believe he 'd been dead ten years . A short chunky man , a blond Italian from Lombardy . A nervous man , a restless man with a heart damaged by rheumatic fever . And his parents , staid respectable shopkeepers , shocked by their son 's emigration . And shocked again by his change of name . During one of the summers Joan had spent with him ( long after the divorce ; the marriage had lasted only a few months after her birth ) he had showed her a letter from them , a letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she remembered . " The old people , " he 'd told her , " how can you explain to them ? Even twenty years later they are worrying about this because they do n't understand  --  a new country , a new name . Anthony Mitchell sounds good , little one . " That same summer , she remembered , he 'd had a playhouse built for her , a tiny perfect house , furnished with tiny furniture and with a stove and an icebox that actually worked . He met her there every afternoon , and they walked up to the main house and had supper together , him watching , whisky in hand , while she ate . Sometimesthere would be someone else there too , if he happened to have a friend staying with him . . . . That par/ticular summer Joan thought it had been a tall beautiful woman named Margaret . She had never known her last name , she only called her Margaret . It seemed to her sometimes that Margaret had been around more than the others ; maybe he was even going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of years later he was dead . Then all there was left was in Metairie Cemetery , a fancy marble tomb with two angels and a cross and the name Anthony Mitchell carved across the front of it , in letters a foot high ... . Aurelie 's taffeta rustled and Joan was twenty again and back in the house on Coliseum Street . " Does n't it seem funny to you , " Joan asked , " all of us living on his money ? " " He was most generous . " " Just that fountain , why do you suppose he was so crazy about that fountain ? " " I was in love with him , " Aurelie said , " or I would never have let him put it there . " " Why did he want to keep it so very much ? " " I have n't the faintest idea , child . " " You know what ? " Joan asked , " I know why he did n't marry Margaret . I think he was still in love with you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That was the only comment she had ever made . Joan chuckled . The nasty taste of the evening withMichael was disappearing ; she was feeling better . Aurelie went back to her magazine.  | " You know , " Joan said , " you look so wonderfully motherly , with glasses , I mean . " " I 've heard about bifocal contact lenses , " Aurelie said without lifting her eyes from the page , " I shall have to see about them . "  |p51JOAN  had her hand on the door to her room when the phone rang . Michael 's calling back . .. . She waited , holding her breath . But she was still not surprised when she heard Aurelie begin a conversation . It could n't be . But if it was , I 'd have gone out and waited for him . She went into her room . And he 'll never come back . Because I was n't the sort of girl he likes ... . She 'd felt this way before . The ache was familiar . Hurt pride , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get so upset just because my little pride gets hurt ? All these feelings , all these god-damn feelings ... . It 's something about me , she thought . I never can get the men I want . She felt sad . Very sad . And being sad felt good . It was a pleasure , really . Like eating something you liked . A mild pleasure . The whole world took on a lovely grey tinge and everything was weeping.  |p52She  dragged the record player and its little table across the room and plugged it in right beside the bed . Then she rummaged around in the back of her closet until she found the recording she wanted : Liebestod . She lay back on the bed and closed her eyes and thought great cloudy thoughts and felt sadness run over her in huge predictable waves like the surf . Every now and then she spoke out loud to herself . " It 's hell to be alive , " she told herself , " and it would be hell to be dead too . " The record finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over again , turningup the volume . " If I died , they would be sorry . " And she saw herself laid out . " I do n't get anything right . Not ever . " She put the record on for a third time and cried little fat tears into the hot still night.  |p53AURELIE  insisted on breakfast , a formal breakfast in the dining room . The table was carefully set with the same flower-patterned spode each morning . The food was carefully arranged on the buffet over little warmers and under little covers . It was the one rule of the house . Aurelie said nothing about late hours , never had . From the time they left the nursery and moved into rooms of their own , her daughterscame and went as they pleased . But each and every morning , they were required to appear for breakfast . Aurelie , her hair carefully arranged , her face carefully made up , her robe of crisp taffeta in the summer and soft velvet in the winter , sat at the head of the table and made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good many years past , Aureliewas alone . Her husband Herbert Norton had long since stopped coming down . ( Her previous husband , and the only other one Joan had been old enough to remember , had never been present in the mornings either.  |p54He  had been a tall thin Lincoln-like Alabamian , a hardworkingsurgeon , who was always up at five thirty , out of the house by six , and operating by seven . ) For the first year of their marriage Herbert Norton had appeared for breakfast . Or rather Aurelie had gone up and brought him down . Joan remembered his big nearsighted blue eyes circled by gold-rimmed glasses , peering out from behind Aurelie as they entered the room . He was much taller than she was ; he was very nearly six feet , but he gave the impression of being small . He was delicate-boned and thin , formally politeand very self-effacing . He had been in the Navy for twenty years , had married Aurelie and retired . That had been ten years past . For those years he had drunk steadily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was most polite and came most willingly . But he had to be fetched for each appearance , and after a few years Aurelieno longer bothered . So , bit by bit , he disappeared : first from the breakfast table , then from the main part of the house and the main part of their lives . Some three years after their marriage Aurelie had the top floor , the third floor , remodeled for him . He had insisted on only one thing : a fire escape , an ugly old-fashioned iron one , that climbed the side of the house . After that he seemed quite happy to move up there . By then it had been months since they had gone out together , and when Aurelie entertained at home , she often forgot to fetch him . After all , he had no friends and seemed rather glad to be left alone. p 55He did not come down at all . Aurelie 's cook brought him his meals . And there was a phone that he used only to call the liquor store . He did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ann . Just a year after the marriage Aurelie had borne another daughter , a thin dark baby with tilted eyes and pointed pixie ears , who turned into a tall thin precocious child with a startling resemblance to Aurelie and none at all to her father . She spent her summersat camp and her winters at convent school in Florida . Most of the time Joan forgot he was in the house , rememberingonly when she saw the delivery boy from the liquor store climbing up the three flights , cursing softly under his breath . Remembering again when the doctor plodded up wearily , for Mr. Norton had had two mild heart attacks . Every evening with the gathering dark he pulled in the shutters and closed all the windows in his two rooms and locked them . And every morning with the first strong light  --  four thirty in the summers and seven in the winters  --  he staggered around opening them again . At the one that was framed by the highest shoots of the moonflower vine he would always stop , press his nose against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The dust on the screen invariably made him sneeze , a gigantic snort that echoed all along the block . Each morning it was the same . The people in the house had gotten so used to it that they no longer even heard it.  |p56He  lived peacefully up there , with his charts and militarybooks and strange old-fashioned navigating instruments . And every now and then he made a trip to the hospital to have his gentle little delusions replaced by heavy shots of vitamin B.His stepdaughters forgot he was there . And if Aurelie remembered , she never mentioned it . So , that morning , the third of June , only Aurelie and Doris were at the table when Joan came down . Aurelie glanced at her critically . " Mercy sakes , child , " she said to Joan when she appeared , " whatever happened to your eyes ? " " Nothing happened to them . " Doris , who was wearing clean white shorts and a shirt , grinned over her coffee cup . " Wagner all night long , huh ? " " Honestly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again ?  --  Joan shrugged and poured her coffee . " I happen to like music . " " I 'll forgive you , " Doris said . " You want to come play tennis ? " " Where 's your date ? " " I 've got one , honey , do n't you worry . But I was goingto ask him to bring a friend for you . " " Thanks , " Joan said , " but my tennis is n't very good . " " You 've got to do something here in the summer . " " I think , " Joan said , " I 'll go take a course . " She en/joyed their surprise . And the plan grew as she spoke . " A cultural summer . I 'm going to sign up for a couple of courses in music over at the college . " " Good old tone deaf , " Doris said . " Honestly , child , " Aurelie said , " what a waste of money . " It 's my money , " Joan said stubbornly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want . " " That , " Doris said , " reminds me of a joke . " " Not at breakfast , " Aurelie said . " Would n't you think you 'd get enough school all year without adding to it in the summer ? " " That 's my affair . " " Okay , rich bitch , " Doris said . " That is quite enough , " Aurelie said . " It 's nice , " Doris said , " to have an intellectual sister . " " A bookish woman , " Aurelie said , " is simply impos-sible . " " Call my broker , " Doris mimicked , " I am just loaded with money . " Joan stared at the blue glass Victorian jam jar and the silver napkin ring that lay beside it . " Two of you , " she said slowly . And she picked up the ring and balanced it on the top of the jam jar . " The two of you line up against me . " " Ohhhhhh , " Doris moaned , " poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " you are so solemn . " Joan studied the edge of the plate , and slowly shep58went over every object on the table as if she had never seen them before . " The two of you , " she repeated . And the words brought back the sorrow of last night , the wonderful lovely sorrow . . . . The lost . . . the something that was lost , the place you could n't go back to , the dream you did n't want to give up in the morning and you lay tight in bed trying and trying to hold it and it slipped away , like fog , and you could n't remember the smell or the color or the feel of it , what it was and where it had been . And that was the final end , when there was n't even a memory . . . . Joan lifted her eyes in time to see Doris clutching her throat in anguish , chanting : " Oh woe , oh woe , O Weltschmerz , O Wiener Schnitzel , O crap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the table sharply so that the dishes rattled . " That is quite enough . Leave the table . " " Yes , Mother . Going , Mother . Right away , Mother . " Doris giggled , but she got up at once and slipped out of the door into the kitchen . They could hear her begin a conversation with the cook . In a couple of minutes a car tooted outside , and the kitchen door slammed . The car zoomed off , double clutching with a roar . Aurelie poured herself some coffee , then filled Joan 's cup . " Here , you funny little sad thing , " she said . Joan added sugar without answering . " One thing . . . " Aurelie said , " my daughters are different . Joan , honey , do n't you think you 'd be happier if you were married ? "  | " Fred ? " " A very fine man , " Aurelie said . " I could n't approve more . And we have n't had a lawyer in this family for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical school and never get mar-ried . " Aurelie chuckled her deep mannish tones . " You flunked biology , dear . " " I might be a missionary . " " A nice man , " Aurelie said . " We 've been so unlucky with men in this family . " " Your favorite subject , " Joan said sourly . " A woman alone , " Aurelie said , " is so very sad . " " If I 'm going to register , " Joan said , " I 've got to get dressed and over there . " She felt her mother 's accusing eyes follow her from the room.  |p60SHE  had been in college for two years and it seemedjust like another school day as she walked the shortthree blocks from the front gate on Coliseum Street tothe campus . At the first corner she pulled an orange hibiscusfrom the bush in the Landry yard , the way shedid every morning . For the rest of that block , without looking , she tore the saucer-shaped flower to carefulpieces so that she left an orange trail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iron walk that crossedthe gutter and dropped in the last bits of stamen andgreen leaf that her fingers still held . It was a deep gutter , its sides lined with careful sloping slabs of slate . Since itwas the deepest drain in the neighborhood there was alwayswater in it  --  even once when it had frozen ( backwhen she was a child of six or seven ) there had been iceso thick on it that the children had come down andwalked along it , making skating motions . Until PhilipCarter , the redheaded boy who lived two blocks away ,  |p61went  home and got his roller skates . After a couple of trips he had cut through the ice and the wheels had wedged in the soft mud . That was the end of the ice skating . By afternoon the sun slipped around under the trees and the ice melted . There had not been another freeze like that again . For weeks after there was the smell of dead foliage decaying in the sun . At the third corner a streetcar went clanking past and she stopped and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As if it were reminding her alwaysthat she was about to leave for a marvelous place . . . . She loved the streetcars . Each time the city removed a line she felt a little clutch of bewilderment ; she could see the day coming when there would be no more left . And what then ? And where would she go then when she was disturbed and sick with the peculiar kind of nausea that fear gave her ? .. . She was afraid of so many things . Sometimes for no reason at all , she would feel the muscles knot up and the cold feeling begin . Then she would head for the streetcarline and ride , back and forth , for an hour or so , until the noisy rocking ride comforted her . She stared after the car as it traveled rapidly down the tracks , rocking decidedly from side to side , a clumsy **26;3329;TOOLONG . It was nice to have it there . . . . She was whistling as she turned through the imitationGothic gates that bore a bronze plaque sayingp62A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the lit t lc lamps had a broken glass . She had never been to summer school before , but she had not expected any difference . When she came around the building and looked out over the quadrangle , she stopped abruptly , startled , trying to see what had changed . It was n't the people . There were as many of them as ever , streaming over to the far building to register for their classes . It was the grounds . They looked seedy  --  like a good suit that had been slept in . Under the fierce June sun and the heavy rains , the staff of gardeners made no headway . There was one man now , an enormously fat Negro , wheeling about on a tremendous lawn mower . He flicked by her . Grass splattered out on the path . She studied the cut blades and fancied that she could see them begin to grow again , leaping up from under the path of the mower . You could feel it growing , she thought , even under the pavement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They grew at right angles to the ground , like mad children crawling along on hands and knees . Next to a building a single sunflower shot straight up and turned its flat yellow face at the level of the second-floor windows , ten feet high . And the honeysuckle , along the walls , sprouted long wavy arms into the air or stuck creeping exploring fingersalong the brick . A girl and a young man went by , holding handsp 63loosely in the heat . Her full starched petticoats and skirt rustled and left a faint trail of starch smell . Joan found herself watching after them , watching the girl 's feet , lean brown feet in tiny-strapped white sandals . I 've got ugly feet , she thought , thin and long and bony . My toes are funny lengths and the veins go back and forth , like clotheslines . I wish I had nice feet and I would n't have to wear stockings and cover-up shoes all the time . . . . She walked along toward the registration building . A wasp droned over her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Out of sight , but not far off , a Good Humor man went past , his wagon tinkling a distorted version of the Brahrns Lullaby . A large brown and white dog loped up and began digging frantically in a camellia bed . When the hole was deep and long enough , he curled around in it , fitting it to himself , and stretched out , belly down on the cool damp . Joan was watching him , when from behind her someonesaid : " Of all the people I did n't expect to find in summer school , you are it . " She went on watching the dog . The voice was familiar ; she had heard it before , but she could not place it . If I turn around , she told herself just as slowly as she could think , I could tell who it is . . . . If I turn around . . . . It was a thing she did , this thinking very slowly . She worked at it ; she had trained herself so that thoughtsp64came before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to turn each one over and study it , like the slow progression of slides under a microscope . " I was saying hello . " Michael Kern stepped around and stood directly in front of her . " Hello again . " " I do n't like to be hurried , " she said stupidly . His eyes were a yellowish brown , she noticed , in the strong sun . " So take your time . " The slow progression was ruined . Things speeded up to their ordinary pace . She felt annoyed and cheated . " What are you taking ? " she asked . " Taking ? " He could lift one eyebrow straight up so that it almost touched his low growing hair . " I 'm giv-ing . " " You 're what ? " " I teach , " he said . " Did n't Doris tell you ? " She wished he had not said that , and wished that the words had not made a difference . " I do n't think we talked about it . " " Did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she ? " " Did n't you want to know what I did when you went out with me ? " " No , " she said . " It did n't seem important . At all . " " For God 's sake . " She began to walk toward the building . He fell into step beside her . " You 're a strange gal . " p 65 " I suppose I should ask what you teach ? " " No , honey bunch , " he said , " but it 's economics . " " Oh . " " Take my course . " " I 'm taking art this summer . Art survey . " " Why ? " " Something to do . The summers are kind of long if you do n't do something . " " What did you take last year ? " " I did n't , " she said . " I went to Jamaica and then to Mexico . " " Sounds like fun . " " So much fun I ca n't afford to go back this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Not really . " They passed the cafeteria . " Want a cup of coffee ? " " No , " she said , " I 'd rather go and get finished right now . " Okay , " he said , " see you . " He touched her shoulder briefly . The registration hall was stifling . She stood in endless lines and waited patiently , staring at the sweat-stained shirts around her , seeing them and not really seeing them . The tall Gothic windows on each side were open , but no breeze moved through them . Mosquitoes came , in slow drifting clouds and dragonflies followed them , weaving back and forth with quick ducking movements . Outside , and far off , the band began practice , the sum/mer band , sounding thin and reedy . Most of the players would have gone home . She sat down on the floor in a corner and patiently filled out a long duplicate form , writing laboriously on the back of her purse . She paid little attention to what she was doing . Her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the heat the smell of sex was almost tangible , almosthung in the air like smoke . She noticed that at the beginning of every term  --  men and women thrown together in the same large hall , brushing elbows , brushing hips , until the air was full and you could almost hear the heavy breathing . She had always noticed that . The glance , the appraisal  --  she hated the girls for their coy peep from under the lashes ; she knew what they were thinking . She knew what Doris was thinking . Doris liked to talk and had explained in great detail what she looked for in a man , how she selected him first , from across a room , and what she liked in bed . And no one , she thought , is trying me . . . . That was the way it always happened . She was nice looking , she was even quite pretty ; she had a lovely figure , lush and full . But there was something in her that repelled advances . She wondered about that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to change it . A certain directness , a businesslike manner , that was not very feminine . A manner that reminded of tweeds and low-heeled shoes and sensible hats . . . . She lookedp67a great deal like Elizabeth of England ; people told her that often . She thought with a wry smile : that means I look more motherly than wifely ... . She had almost finished filling the registration form . She had come to the part that asked for her religious preference . Always before this she had written Catholic . Though she had not been in a church for years . This time , she wrote plainly : Mahayana Buddhist . That would interest them , she thought , if they ever bothered to read those things . The idea amused her . She stopped writing and grinned out across the crowded floor . As she did , she caught a brief glimpse of Michael Kern . Or perhaps it was n't . But it was enough . For all the rest of the morning she could feel the imprint of his hand on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Doris won the city 's singles tennis championship . She and Aurelie argued for days about having the trophy in the living room . Aurelie won , as she always did . Doris carried the hideous yellow thing up to her room and sulked . Fred Aleman went on his two-week vacation . Joan saw him off on the cruise ship at the Julia Street wharf , the sleek white ship that would eventually deposit him at Buenos Aires . She brought him a little box of English cookies , a hideous tin box with a leering picture of WinstonChurchill on the cover in four garish colors . She kissed him good bye awkwardly , wondering if anyone was looking . And clumped down the gangplank , catchingher heel and almost tripping , conscious suddenly that her white dress had a smear of black tar . . . . The other days blended together in a mist of heat and steamy rains . She went to class , sat and listened and wrote down the parts of a symphony and the definitionp69of a fugue and bought herself a recorder and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the assistant dean asked to see her . He was a short balding young man , with an apoplecticface and a heavy mood of jollity that was a protectionagainst student problems . " Now what do we have here ? " he laughed mirthlessly . Joan felt silly . " I do n't know , " she said , " what do we have ? " He looked at her sharply . " I was n't being funny , " she said . " Sign up for a course in art and then do n't appear . . . . The instructor is wondering what happened to you . " He held out the class card . Joan took it and studied it slowly . There , in her own handwriting . Two courses listed : the music , then Art 103 . She remembered . " I 'm sorry . " " Have n't been sick ? " " No , " she said . " You do n't want to change to another course or anything like that ? " " No , " she said again . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You what ? " " Forgot . I just forgot . " " Well , well , " he muttered with heavy irony , " the heat does strange things to all of us. "  | " I know that sounds silly . " " Do you think , " he said , standing up , " you could manage to remember now ? " " Yes , " she answered seriously . " Yes , I can . " " It might be a splendid thing to do . " " I will , " she said , " yes , I will . And thank you for reminding me . " He stopped the reply that was balanced on his tongue . She probably did n't mean that . As they shook hands , he studied her eyes carefully . They were nice eyes , blue , with dark lashes . They had a sick look too ; they were sort of opaque . So he kept still and only allowed himself to sigh , deep and sad , after she had gone . " We get them all , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and checked to be sure that the air conditioner was really working at full capacity . Joan went to art class the very next day . And found she liked it . She bought herself a pale green smock and spent hours scratching away with pieces of charcoal on large pads of white paper . She took her sketches home and pinned them to the wall with tiny bits of Scotch tape . After two weeks most of the great pink cabbage roses were hidden from sight . Aurelie , who never came to her room , slipped in the door one day and looked around . " Mercy , child , " she said , " this is such a strange summer . " " Who told you ? " Joan demanded . " Who told you about them ? That little bitch Doris ? "  | " How sharper than a serpent 's tooth it is to have a thankless child , " Aurelie quoted . " Oh shit ! " " The lack of range in your vocabulary , " Aurelie said , " is simply appalling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you ever get angry ? " " A soft answer turneth away wrath . " " Oh God , " Joan said . The following week , which was just a few days before Fred came home , Joan got a job at the college library . From four until eleven at night , when the library closed , she sat up on the sixth level of the stacks at a hard little steel desk and waited for circulation to call for books on that floor . Nobody wanted that job . It was the next to the highestlevel and the air conditioning did n't work too well up there , so there was always the stuffy odor of gently moving dust and the faintly carbolic odor of the bindings . It was the quietest of all the levels . There were few calls for books and hardly anyone came by . The staff had always tossed coins for it , until Joan came . She liked it up there . Liked the dusty quiet . Liked the emptiness . And sometimes she went up to the next level , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , only faint yellow bulbs too small to cast much light . Uncatalogued things were kept there . Heaps of old magazines . Wooden boxes of mementos . And collections given to the library as units . The smell of old leather wasp72as thick as incense . Pictures . And daguerreotypes . And swords in velvet boxes . One small wood box labeled Souvenirs of Sarah Bernhardt . Joan would have opened that , but the top was nailed on . She pried at it some with a little fingernail file she carried in her purse but gave it up to open a hand-bound volume of ornate leather called The Genealogy of the Wives of Louisiana Governors . Because her heels echoed so on the glass floor , she took to leaving her shoes under the desk and padding silently about the top level in her nylons . There was a single window on the west side , and she discovered it one day . After that she would spend hours standing there , leaning against the concrete , looking out over the campus . She was above even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The window did n't open , so she could hear no sounds ; she only saw the play of light , the changing from day to evening , from evening to dark . The evening star would swim into view just over the biggest of the oak trees . She would see the lights come on , yellow for some , blue for the fluorescents . There were some rooms on the south side of the level , little empty rooms all in a line , like the tiny rooms in an army hospital . They were windowless too with only a big round 0 of fluorescent tube in the ceiling . On their doors , right under the small clear glass square of windowlooking in , was a carefully lettered sign : Study . It was done in very precise Gothic script.  |p73The  rooms were not used , never had been . Their concretebrick walls were not even painted . No one came up here . She like to go into the rooms sometimes and stand very still and listen and try to imagine things or rememberthings , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was very important for her to do it . She would turn on the overhead corridor light ( only one worked ) and stare at the dust as it floated under it . One evening , after supper , and shortly before the libraryclosed , she was padding around as usual in her bare feet . There had been a couple of calls for books , only one of which she had been able to find . She circledaimlessly looking for the remaining one , the call slip clutched in her hand . She was passing back by the line of studies when she noticed the noise . Not a real sound so much as a brushing . A sound that almost was n't a sound . Instinct told her sharply : go back to the desk and read ; you have n't heard anything . But she padded silentlyalong . It was the second little square glass window she looked into . The door was almost closed and the window was coated with grime , but still she had no trouble making out the two figures on the floor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was seeing , thinking with silly precision : the floor must be awful on their backs . . . . Then she felt the delayed rush of embarrassment and scooted back to her desk . She sat for a moment under the little goose/neck lamp , studying the scratched initials on the metal top . Then she put on her shoes and pounded down the narrow stairs to the next level . " Hi , " she said , " I got lonesome so I thought I 'd come down and say hello . " The three girls who worked that level stared at her in surprise . She had never done that before.  |p75FRED  ALEMAN came back , his olive skin tanned almostmahogany by wind and sun . He brought Joan a vicuna stole and a long necklace  --  a marriage chain , he called it  --  of silver so soft she could bend it in her fingers . Joan folded the stole away to wait for cool weather and wore the necklace dutifully each time she went out with him . She saw him only on week ends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the library . She wondered sometimes if the change in their plans had upset him , but he said nothing . He did call her every evening when she got home . But if he missed her he said nothing . One Saturday  --  the first since he 'd come back  --  he took her to the concert in Beauregard Square . She wore a brand-new blue print dress , cut low in back , and she had borrowed Aurelie 's beaded bag . Fred 's cluster of tiny white roses perched on her shoulder . They sat in the warm still night , at a table that was too small , and drank rum collinses . Her stockings snagged on a splin/tered chair . The unmoving air still smelled heavily of the DDT with which the area had been sprayed . Even so , a few mosquitoes circled and droned lazily overhead . " Do you remember , " Joan said , " how often we used to come to these last summer ? " " I think it was a better series last year , " Fred said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lake at night and go swimming ? " " And how you thought you saw a gar ? " She made a face . " I did feel something . . . . But all that was fun . " " Yes , " he said , " it was . " If he would only tell her . If he would only admit that he missed her those weekday evenings . She wondered what he did , though she knew she should never ask . Maybe he was finding somebody else . She did n't even know if he missed her . " I get to thinking about it sometimes , " she admitted slowly . " And it was kind of fun when we had time to go and do things like that . " He leaned back in the chair , which creaked under his weight , and chuckled . " Young lady , " he said , " if you did n't want to work evenings , you would n't do it . And wild horses could n't drag you there . " She smiled feebly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little light from the one candleon the table . He was handsome , in a heavy solid way . The thick black hair , the heavy jaw , the wide forehead.  | " You know , " she said , " what 's the best thing about you ? " " No , " he said . " What ? " " Your coloring . Olive skin and black eyes are awfully good with a white shirt . " " Thank you , ma'am . " Then it popped out . " What do you do in the evenings , when I 'm working ? " He smiled gently . " Layovers to catch meddlers . " " No , " she said , " I mean it . " " So do I. " His smile was n't as gentle as she had first thought . But she plunged ahead , because she had gone too far to stop . " I just wanted to know . " " What do you do ? " " I work . " " I 've heard . " " I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't think so , but I 'm glad to hear it . " " Do you ? " " I told you : layovers to catch meddlers . " He was teasing now , and she stopped , knowing that she had brought up a subject that would spoil the rest of the evening . He was annoyed with her , she could tell . She had known him too long not to recognize the signs . Why do I always do it , she thought fiercely . Why do I have to ruin things ? Why always me ? And I still do n't know if he misses me . I do n't even know that . " I 'm sorry , " she said miserably and then saw that thep78apology had made things worse ; it had embarrassed him . She stared down at her glass and busily removed a gnat that had fallen in . " When this is finished , " he said , " want to go out to the Fairfax Club and try your luck ? " It was an old joke between them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gamble . She would go and stand by the tables by the hour and watch the players and watch the wheel and the board or the dice . She would go to the races and study the form and dope out the horses and head toward the parimutuel window , but somehow she always came back with the money jammed way down in the pocket of her coat . She could n't do it . Not even just two dollars . " I 'd like to go , " she said truthfully . The sense of excitement in the gamblers about her always left her exhilaratedtoo . " When the concert 's over , " Fred promised . " It 's not really very good tonight . " " I 'm afraid not . " " It 's not nearly as good as last year , " she said . Hours later they went into the bar at the Fairfax Club . It was deserted , as it nearly always was . Most peoplepreferred the gambling rooms . Joan sat at the bar , swishing out her skirts so that they did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handbag on the bar and folded her gloves neatly on top . " Why is it always empty in here ? "  | " I suppose , " Fred said , " most people want to be near the action . " " Oh . " She noticed the clock , twenty past one . That was why she felt tired . " You get to play tonight ? " " Do n't tease me , Fred . " He grinned . " A wild gambler like you , always after the action .... " " I saw you play , " she said hastily . " Did you win ? " " Some , " he said ; " enough to buy our drinks anyway . " " I 'm glad . " She ordered brandy and soda . He lifted his eyebrows but said nothing when the empty-eyed barman brought the soda and she poured it as a chaser . " Do n't look so disapproving . " " My dear child , " he said , " your drinking is not one of the things I worry about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a faint one , and she pushed right ahead , wondering if she was going to have it now . " What do you worry about ? " " About you ? " he laughed softly . " Not very much . You 're a smart gal , with a sensible mother , so who can worry ? " That was n't it , she thought . It took a turn the wrong way and went off where I did n't want it to go , and I ca n't bring it back . Where was it ? It was there . Somewhere . And I lost it . He was speaking to her , still teasing . " Of course I might worry about your gambling . "  |p80She  finished her brandy , and twirled the empty glass . The barman came over and she pushed it to him . Fred nodded to him . " Why do you suppose , " Joan said , " that I ca n't gamble ? " " I do n't know . Any ideas ? " " Maybe because my father was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " " Did you ever know my father ? " " That 's a funny thing to ask . " " Did you ? " " I met him , of course . Long before I knew you . " " How ? How did you meet him ? " " We had business , " Fred said . " When he was selling that big LaChaise tract out by the lake . " " Oh , " she said . " After all , " he said , " you could n't be around downtownvery much and not run into him . " " I never saw him downtown , " she said . " He was sort of all over the place . I can still see him rushing off down the corridor , with his heels going like drums on the marble . " " I never saw him there , " she repeated ; " I only used to see him when I went across the Tickfaw on week ends and holidays . " " It 's nicer over there , " Fred suggested gently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd let me come down . "  |p81She  was beginning to feel very sad . Fred reached over and touched her shoulder . " Come on , Sarah Bernhardt , " he said , " do n't cry in your beer . " " Let 's go dance somewhere . " " You 're going home . " " This early ? " " You , my dear , are drunk . " " Hell , " she said softly . Even so , she was glad of his hand on her arm as they walked out . She held herself very stiff and proper and took one step at a time , not too slowly , but very carefully . The attendant at the parking lot was asleep in his lighted shack that looked for all the world like a phone booth . " Wait . " Fred tiptoed over and lifted his keys off the hooked board . She was conscious that she was swaying very slightly when he came back . " Let the poor bastard sleep , " he said . " I would n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's his job and all . " " That 's because you 're basically mean and cruel . " " No , " she said , " it 's because the gravel is hurting my shoes . " He chuckled and , slipping an arm around her waist , steadied her along . As they turned out of the lot , she said , " Let 's put the top down . "  | " This , young lady , is not a convertible . " " Oh , " she said . " I forgot . I thought you had a con-vertible . " " You are drunk . " She leaned back against the seat . He reached over and pulled her along the slick surface until she sat next to him . He swung one arm over her shoulder and pulled her still tighter . " I am , sort of , " she said . " I always know I am when I start talking about my father . " " And what 's so strange about that ? " " Because I hardly ever saw him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why . " She sighed . " Things are so simple for you . " " Maybe , " he said , " things are just simple . Period . " She stopped trying to think and settled down to watch the lights go swimming past the windshield . A splatter of red and green . Then black . Then faint yellow , and more red and green . " There 's a moon , " he said ; " want to go out to the lake and neck ? " She nodded . He did not answer , but she was consciousnow that he drove faster . " It 's an old moon " she said . " What did you expect , this time of month , this time of night ? " " I guess I do n't know the date , or the time either . "  | " Well , mercy sakes , " he mimicked , " my little drunken friend . " " I wish I had a drink right now . " " You do n't need it . " " I bet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Bet I do too . " " If you only had ice . " " I 'll put in a refrigerator just for you . " " I want a drink . " " In a while , if you 're a good little girl I 'll give you one . " She stopped listening then and gave herself up to the long swooping rolls of her desire . Fred talked on . She could hear him from a great distance . At first she had tried to listen , to understand him . That had been months ago . Then she realized she did n't have to . He talked , joked even , from the time he switched off the car engine until the instant of his shuddering climax . Then after a brief interval , he began again . She rather liked it . It was like having the radio on . It was soothing . She heard the silence , she let herself drift on waves of alcohol and pleasure . " You have been a good little girl , " he said finally . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink . " He leaned over across the front seat , ' got the pint and the two shot glasses.  | " Does n't even burn , " Joan said . " Old Forester . " " You did want to make it a special evening . " " Did I ? " " The roses , and the whole thing seemed kind of that way . " " Maybe , " he said quietly , " when I get to see you these days it seems like a holiday . " If she had said something then , it would have been all right . It would have been the way it was before . She knew it and she tried to think what to say . But her liquor-foggedmind moved slowly , and the words formed slowly : I wo n't work evenings any more , if you do n't want me to . And I would also like to get married . She delayed too long . She found exactly the right words but did n't get to use them . He was mocking , lightly , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the library could n't run without you . " " I like to work , " she said faintly ; " it keeps the summerfrom being boring . " " Sure , " he said . " Just that you want to do something different sometimes , not for any reason . " " To keep the summer from being so boring . " " Oh quit , " she said wearily , " quit . " Aurelie stirred in her big four-poster , opened her eyes and stared up at the lace canopy that glowed faintly in the little crack of light from the hall . She heard it again , p 85a second car door . Of course . They would be coming home , one of her two girls . She got up and went to the window , lifting the corner of the shade gently , and peeped out . She recognized Joan 's stocky figure , and then the street light fell on Fred 's heavy handsome head . A nice looking man , she thought , automatically . And then a second thought crossed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few minutes , she heard the front door slam , and then Joan 's uncertain feet on the stairs . She 's drunk , Aurelie thought with considerabledistaste . She seemed to have reached the top of the stairs . Aureliecould hear her stop for breath , trying to decide which way her room was . A soft thud of something light dropping , and then the steps shuffled off across the bare wood . Another stop and shoes were kicked off ; one knocked into the wall , and Aurelie jumped . A door opened , too hard , and smacked into the wainscoting . Aurelie sighed and got up . Since the house was very hot , she did not bother putting on a robe . The feel of the nylon nightgown drifting between her legs was vaguely pleasant . As she expected , there were shoes in the hall , and a chiffon scarf , and over by the stairs , a purse had been dropped . She sighed again . The door to Joan 's room was open and the little night light was burning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being particularlyquiet . Joan was sprawled face down crosswise onp86the bed , her feet still touching the floor . She was fully dressed . Aurelie sighed again . Joan was the sloppy child . No matter how tired or drunk Doris was , she always managed to hang her clothes in the closet , including the time she had come home from a party after an accident with a bottle and her left hand sliced almost off , with eighteen stitches and a great wad of bandages . Aurelie bent over and began undoing the back zipper . Joan did not move . When the dress and bra were opened , Aurelie shook her shoulder firmly . " Get up , " she said . Joan stirred vaguely . Aurelie pulled her to a sitting position  --  notgently  --  and dragged the dress over her head . She shook her again . " Now finish up yourself . " Joan stumbled out of her clothes . Aurelie held out a pajama coat . Some telltale stains and a certain odor  --  Aurelie wondered why she had had nothing but daughters . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . Are you being careful ? " " Huh ? " " Are you being careful , you heard me . " " Sure , " Joan said . " I 'm being careful and Fred 's beingcareful too . " Aurelie let her slip back , and Joan was asleep before she touched the pillow . Aurelie hung up the dress and left , closing the door firmly . She stepped over the shoes and the scarf on thep87hall floor . But she stopped by the purse , picked it up , and emptied its contents out on the little hall table . She blew into it carefully to remove the last speck of powder . Then took it back to her room . After all , it had only been borrowed , she remembered . It belonged to her.  |p88THE  Sunday that followed was a particularly bad day . The first bit of light was just beginning to show when Aurelie came back from Joan 's room , tossed the little purse to her dressing table , and went over to the window . She pulled aside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and opened the shade . The window was high and looked directly into the big camphor tree , so she could see nothing of the ground , just the leaves and the sky above . The air was very still , and almost cool . The odors of night jasmine and sweet olive had gotten all mixed up . They hung heavy and thick like streaks in the still air , or like incense at a funeral . The sky overhead was the strange color that comes just before light , a faint green . There did n't seem to be any traffic moving , even over on the avenue . It was very quiet , only the steady gurgling of the little fountain in the front yard and one sleepy confusedsquaak from a mockingbird . Aurelie heard a sound she did not like  --  the stealthy p 89shifting of furniture upstairs . The last time she had heard that . . . No , she told herself firmly , that would not happen again . She wondered briefly if she should go investigate Herbert'sdoings . But the stairs seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed . She had just slipped off to sleep when she heard Doris come home : the slamming of doors and then Doris herselfstumbling along , singing at the top of her voice . Girls , she thought , all girls . At least the other three are n't home . And she went to sleep . Soundly , this time , black and dreamless . At seven o'clock her phone , the little ivory-colored one with its unlisted number , began to ring . She glared at it for a bit before answering . She listened patiently , said , " Yes , of course , " and hung up . Doris popped her head around the door . She was dressed in the inevitable white shorts and shirt and tennisshoes . " Who 's getting you up so early in the morning ? " Aurelie looked at her with a mixture of annoyance and interest . " Child , " she asked , " when do you sleep ? " " Do n't , " Doris giggled . Aurelie shook her head gently . " Only young once , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? " Aurelie sighed again . " Your sister . "  | " Which one ? " Doris said with a smirk , " I 've got quite a few . " " Celine . " " What 's the little bastard got into this time ? " " Honestly , child , that is no way to talk at all . She is a perfectly nice girl . . . . " " Okay . What happened to her ? " " She got into poison ivy . " " At Camp what-do-you-call-it ? " " Owahkishmewah . She has a bad case , in her ears and under her eyelids . " " Gee , " Doris said with her bright white grin , " what fun for the little monster . " " They called because they wanted to check before sending her in to the hospital at Willis Point . " " My , my , " Doris said cheerily , " she must be near crazy . " Aurelie closed her eyes and settled down against the pillows . " Do n't go to sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news for you . " Aurelie 's large yellow-brown eyes slipped open again . " You must have a remarkable liver , " she said quietly . " You were drunk last night . " " It 's about Papa Herbert . " Aurelie sat up abruptly , remembering the sounds ofmoving furniture she had heard hours earlier . " What ? " " When Clara came in for breakfast , about ten minutes ago , she found him sitting out in the back yard . "  |p91He  had been sitting very quietly in the far corner of the yard , where the high board fence was almost covered with fragrant panicles of the tiny-flowered star jasmine . He was sitting quietly on a little white-painted iron bench ; he was smoking cigarettes and he was naked . " Oh God , " Aurelie said . " Clara 's got a robe on him now . " " Oh , " Aurelie said . " Oh , oh , oh . " " Seems they 're after him . " " Who ? " " The feather merchants . " " Again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 've been talking to him , " Doris said , " and do you want to hear the whole story ? " " Again , " Aurelie repeated wearily . " I ought to have gone up there last night . " " He says he ca n't come in because his rooms are full of the feather merchants , but luckily he was able to trick them and slip on out and leave them locked in up there . " " Oh dear , " Aurelie said , " oh dear . " " As a matter of fact , " Doris lifted one eyebrow , " they 're locked in the bathroom , if you want to know where they are , and he 's piled all the furniture in front of the bathroom door to keep them in . " Aurelie rolled over and picked up the phone . " Tell Clara to stay there and I 'll call for them to come get him . "  | " Tell that nice handsome Dr. Paul hello for me , " Doris said . " Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looks just the way a psychiatrist should look . " Aurelie made the call quickly . There was nothing to arrange . It had all happened before . When she was finished , Aurelie stared into the phone she still held in her hand . " That does it , " she said softly . Doris started at the change of tone . The grin slipped off her face . Aurelie continued . " This is the last time . When he comes out of the hospital this time , he does not come back here . " The surprise passed . Doris was grinning again . " Well , farewell Papa Herbert . " " Hand me the note pad , child . " Aurelie wrote a quick line . " What 's that ? " " Cousin William . I must call him the very first thing Monday morning . " " Divorce ? " " My dear child , " Aurelie said , " I have put up with a great many years of this  --  far more than I have ever done with any man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doris said , " I thought he was permanent or something . " " Child , " Aurelie said , " go to the bathroom and get me three aspirins and a glass of water . " She swallowed them . " So many years ... " p 93 " He 's the helpless type , " Doris said , " brought out the mother in you . " " Go away , " Aurelie said . When she left , Aurelie got up and turned the key in her lock , made herself go back to bed , stretch out under the sheet and close her eyes , pretending , even to herself , that she was asleep . Aurelie was still in bed , Doris had gone , and Joan was n't awake when Dr. Paul and two orderlies came by and picked up Mr. Herbert . There was a little processionof them , the four of them , Indian-fashion , from the kitchen where Mr. Herbert had been waiting ( he had been having a beer with Clara ; he carried the glass carefully in his left hand ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , through the hall and out of the front door . The two orderlies were unnecessary . It was just somethingthe hospital insisted on sending . Mr. Herbert Norton went with them , meek as could be . After all , in his entire life he had never made a fuss , he was always such a perfect gentleman . And he even seemed rather glad to be leaving.  |p94JUNE  ground along . In its last weeks , the sun got hotter and the sky turned a pale blue . Tremendous domed thunderheads with black underbellies sailed over almost every afternoon , dropped their loads of water in drenching downpours . Cars caught in the worst of those rains simply pulled over and stopped and waited . There were almost no pedestrians out  --  there was no staying dry in that kind of rain . Drops ricocheted off pavements and soaked clothes under raincoats ; streets flooded knee deep in a few minutes . Most people simply stayed wherever they happened to be during the afternoons . After all , it never rained before noon or after four . When the clouds moved off and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses shone fiercely , almost as if they were washed in oil . The air itself glittered with the bright clear sharp odor of ozone , left briefly from the violent lightning barrage . In half an hour or so all the wet surfaces began to steam , and the air turned densep95and heavy , like the air in a greenhouse . And in the gardensthe paper plants and the ginger lilies and the crinumsalmost visibly unfolded their waxy flowers . The house on Coliseum Street drowsed behind its closed shutters ( to keep out the rain ) and its permanentlyopened windows . ( Its high ceilings and echoing halls and leaky windows made it impossible to air-condition . ) Aurelie got out her summer rugs of woven straw and her cotton slip covers . And she brought in her ferns and her potted violets . " Place not only looks like a funeral parlor , " Doris said , " it smells like one . " " A thankless child , " Aurelie said and went about her work . When she was done and the house was really ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to visit her cousins in Tennessee . As she stood waiting for the taxi that would take her to the train , she said with a kind of wistfulness , " I went to Europe in the summers , before I had so many children to support . " Joan and Doris , who had to attend the ritual of seeingAurelie off each year , stood on the porch too . " Gee , that 's tough , " Doris said . " Wait till your old age , " Joan said , " and we have to support you . " " That , " Aurelie said dryly , " is something I can wait for without any great impatience . " " Have a good time and give everybody our love . "  | " Be careful with the house , " Aurelie said . " If there should be a real storm , do n't forget to close the windows , and if the water comes through , mop it up right away . " The taxi arrived . Aurelie signaled to it . " It 'll probably be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all those rods sitting up on the roof , attracting it . " " I will thank you , " Aurelie said with dignity , " not to think evil . " " Yes ma'am , " Doris grinned . " And Clara will be in every day . . " Like last year , " Joan said . " And the year before , " Doris said . " And the one before that . " " Well , " Aurelie said , " keep out of trouble when I 'm gone . " " We 'll think about you , " Joan said , " up in those nice cool hills . " " With those nice yellow jacks , " Doris added . The driver had taken the suitcase . " I 'm jealous of anyone who can travel so light , " Joan said . " Comes of lots of practice , " Doris said , " before she had children . " They walked down to the cab and Aurelie kissed them both good bye . " Keep out of trouble and be good . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved off along Coliseum Street . They watched until it turned at the corner.  |p97Doris  scratched a fast rising lump on her thigh . " Anotherdamn mosquito . " " Let 's go in . " " Well , old duck , " Doris flashed her quick grin , " our four weeks of freedom has begun . " " I 'll kind of miss her , " Joan admitted . " Jesus , " Doris said . " Do n't tell me you mean that ? " " I do , kind of . " " You 're getting old , old duck . I can remember when you could n't wait . " " I know . " " Would have thought better of you , " Doris said . " What are you going to do ? " " Have n't got a date until six o'clock . " " Do n't you ever get tired ? " Joan asked wistfully . " Sometimes . " Briefly , for a few seconds , Doris 's handsome tanned face was serious . The crispness , the gayness slipped away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had seen her like this before , not often , not more than once or twice a year , and never for long . " The easiest way to get over being tired , " Doris said seriously , " is just keep going . " " I wish I could . " " There 's time enough for resting , " Doris said . " After-wards . " A flicker of something in the dark , heavily lashed eyes reminded Joan that her little sister had been deathhauntedall through her childhood.  |p98She  's afraid , Joan thought , but she can swagger her way out of it . Doris changed . The bright hard grin came back . She shrugged , " To hell with the whole business . " " Well , " Joan said , " what are you going to do right now ? " " Me ? " Doris said , " I 'm going right straight up to Aurelie'sbedroom and I 'm going to lie right down on her bed , right on that precious spread , and I 'm going to smoke cigarettes until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Without Aurelie the house seemed empty . Joan had never realized how much she had filled it . Because she felt vaguely lonely and upset , Joan went to the kitchen and  --  in spite of Clara 's threats  --  got out the recipe for angel food cake . It failed . While Clara chuckled delightedly , she dumped it into the garbage can , stalked out of the yard . She caught the St. Charles car and rode around the belt three times before she felt like coming home.  |p99TWO  days after Aurelie left , on a Wednesday morning , Joan walked through the campus gate , headed for her music class . She was thinking about nothing in particular , but she just happened to raise her eyes . She stopped so short that she nearly stumbled . Michael Kern was leaning on his elbows at a screenlesswindow on the second floor , grinning down at her . " For heaven 's sake ! " " Wait a minute . " He disappeared . She wondered if she should stay right where she was . That did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if she were glued there . So she moved over to the steps and leaned , as casually as she could , on the railing . A minuteor so passed and she wondered if she had misunderstood . She would look silly . . . . Maybe she just ought to go on . . . . Then he came pounding down the steps . " Met some people and had to say hello . " She smiled , while having the strange feeling thatp100came to her when she heard about people in a world she did n't know . It felt sort of like being dead , she had decidedonce . He was wearing a short-sleeved white shirt , and because it was early in the day the starched collar still stuck up crisply and the sleeves still kept their little peaks . " You look mighty happy , " she said . " You know this is the first morning you looked up . " " The what ? " " You come by every morning . " " Sure I do , " she said . " Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass every morning . " A little jolt , it was n't fear , but it was n't quite pleasanteither . " I guess I just never looked up before . " " You go right straight on ahead . . . . Do n't you ever look around or see who 's passing ? " " I 'm usually late in the mornings . " " Full of business . " " No , " she said , " not particularly , there 's just nothing to do around here in summer . " " The fun people are gone , huh ? " " Sort of . " " Why do n't you go ? " " Ca n't afford the places I want . " " Yes , " he said , " it always comes back to that . " She could feel the rough surface of the concrete pressingthrough her thin dress . She stood up . " What 's the hurry ? "  | " Just wanted to stand up . " " What 's your class ? " " You would n't be interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with little gold fillings . " That 's true . " " I 've got just five minutes to get all the way over to Crampton Hall . " " I tell you what , " he said , " I 'll dismiss my class if you 'll cut yours . " A large redbird was building an out-of-season nest in the sprawling gnarled crape myrtle . The tree itself was just coming into bloom . The fat green buds were beginning to burst open into ruffled white flowers . Joan stared up at it . " Do you know , " he said , " your eyes are bright blue in the sun . " " What have we got to do so urgent ? " " I 'll tell you , " he said , " and you wo n't believe me . " " Maybe not . " " I 've got an aunt , " he said , " or maybe she 's a greataunt , and she lives in Montgomery and she has a li-brary . " " A real library , a public library ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like her . Nice old gal . You should see her house , right up on top a hill looking out on some other pitched roofs and cupolas all the way down to the Alabama River . I used to wonder why they call it a river when it 's nothing more than a yellow creek full of garbage . You know , sometimes youp102can smell it clear up to the house when the wind 's right in summer . " Joan looked down from the redbird and over directly at him . She was pleased to notice that her hard stare made him shift his eyes to a farther building . " Anyhow , " after a very short almost imperceptible pause , " this old gal has a library , pardon me , a room that she calls a library because it 's full of books . . .. " " I got it , " she giggled . " The books were left by her husband who did n't read them either . But there 's one thing in there that she 's particular about and they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And that 's why she needs a set of new owls . " Of what ? " " Owls , honey child . There are stuffed owls sitting on the tops of the bookcases , one to each side of the room . " " And the moths got them . " " Some other bugs too . So she wants me to find her four new stuffed owls . " " Do n't ask me , " Joan said , " I would n't know where to tell you to go . " " I found one place . I think . It 's hard as if I was looking for dope or something illegal . " " I do n't think it is legal to shoot an owl . " " What 's so particular about owls ? " " I do n't know . I just thought I remembered seeing that somewhere . "  | " Oh God , " he said , " now I 've got to smuggle owls . " " But you found a place ? " He was staring out across the campus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  that his eyes were dark and that they had ridiculously long curly lashes like a girl . " That 's where I want to go this morning . There 's an old guy in Tangipahoa has some he 'll sell me . " " This morning ? " " Miss Question-box . . . . Might be fun , who knows ? " " Okay , " she said . " Let 's go . " " Just so you do n't get away , " he grabbed her wrist and raced up the steps , " while I 'm getting rid of my classes . " She was up the two flights almost before she knew it , and down a long dark hall , moving more rapidly than she had in months , conscious of the very tight pressure of his fingers . She wanted to say go slower , I ca n't keep up with you . But she was afraid he would n't hear or stop and people in the halls would turn around and wonder what was going on with him hauling her down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skirts flying and hair falling in her face . " Here , " he said and turned abruptly into a side office . He released her arm . " Look at the pretty books . " Obediently she turned and looked at the shelves oftextbooks , conscious all the while that the three peoplep104in the office were staring at her very hard , all without seeming to look . Two were young men , the third a middle-aged woman typing at a small desk . One of the men said very softly , " Been fishing ? " Michael did not answer him . She wondered if he glared or gave a sign . She could not turn . " Mrs. Wright , " Michael said very formally , " will you dismiss my classes today and tell them that I 'm very sick . " " Sick with what ? " Joan could almost hear him grinning . " I do n't know . Use your own imagination . " She gave a chuckle . " If the old man ever finds out about the rules that are broken around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He wo n't , " Michael said . " Not when you do such a good job . " " Get on out of here and let some other people work . " " Yes , ma'am ! " Joan could hear the chatter begin the very moment they stepped into the hall.  |p105THEY  found the car and started off . " Are n't you afraid somebody will see you riding around like this with the top down ? When you 're supposed to be working , I mean . " The old man , " Michael gave his quick grin over his shoulder , " is at a seminar in the library . And that alwaysruns two and a half hours . " Still , Joan noticed , he took the back way out of town , doubling and twisting along back streets through the narrow section of Carrollton . Finally he got on the old river road . " God , " he said , " I did n't think I could find it . " The road was very bad , and he had to drive slowly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burn her eyes . She began to wish she had brought sunglasses . The pitted bumpy road turned into a new highway . " That does it , old girl , " Michael said . Then they were on the causeway , the straight narrow concrete strip that ran for twenty miles across the lake.  |p106On  each side the water glinted sharp points of light . Up in the sky , the inevitable thunderheads were poised . " By the way , " Joan yelled over the wind , " does your top go up at all ? " " Sometimes . " Again that sharp animal grin . She decided that she liked it . She had n't been sure before , but now she decided that she liked it . With a little sigh she settled herself down on the hot leather cushions , felt the wind whistling by her ears , ruffling out her hair . And she stopped thinking . They swung off the causeway , and Michael slowed down . " God , it 's hot . " " It does n't seem to rain near as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . " It does n't look like they 've had a drop in weeks . " " Well , " Michael said , " I do n't know how long it 's been but it 's sure dusty right now . " He rubbed the side of his face and wiped the palm across his shirt . " Want to stop for a beer ? " She nodded . He turned down narrow winding roads , dirt paved , between rows of pine trees . " There 's a place back in here , " he said , " if I can find it . " " About half a mile more . " " You know it ? " " I used to come over here in the summers , " she said , " when my father was here . " " Have I got the right road ? " " I think so . "  |p107It  was a small bar with a corrugated iron roof and a Jax beer sign blinking in each window . In front was a parking lot of hard , swept white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trees were neatly whitewashed waist-high ; up in their branches were strings of colored lights , and in one of them there was a loudspeaker from the jukebox inside . Behind the building was another parking lot . The same white sand , only here the pine needles had been allowed to accumulate , and the trees grew closer together . There were no lights and there was just the soft muted leftover sound of the jukebox  --  she remembered that . It had been a favorite spot for high-school kids . She wondered if it still was . . . . The place was empty now , of course , with just one out-of-state license pulled up in front . But maybe at night it still was as crowded as it had been the times she 'd come here . It had been jammed then ; you 'd have to hunt for a spot among all the other dark cars parked in the back lot . It was funny , she thought , how little you remembered of those times , though they were so important then . And how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time her corsage had gotten loose and the pin stabbed into her shoulder , drawing blood . And she had not been able to get the boy to understand , and she had been so embarrassed , drawing herself out of hisp108arms and fumbling in her bag for a handkerchief to stop the blood . And she remembered other things : the smell of bad grease from the chicken frying in the bar , the urine smell of the ladies ' room that was n't really a ladies ' room , just a painted privy . The sour vinegar smell of the mustard on the sandwiches they always ordered and never wanted and never ate . The whispers from the other cars parked a couple of feet away . The feel of sweat-soaked shirts , sticky with starch , and skins that were hot and burning to the touch . And the smells insidethe car : of upholstery and gasoline and after-shave and the heavy musky odor of sex . She remembered pain too , fingers that were clumsy and hurt and bodies that were awkward and stiff . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that were more pain and uncertainty than anything else , but desperately longed for and pursued . Michael parked directly in front of the building . He did not ask her if she wanted to stay in the car , even though there were two drowsy carhops leaning against the side of the building . They went inside . " Would you like some lunch ? " " Too early for me . " The beer was cold , and the glasses heavy and frosty . She remembered those glasses , though back in the parkinglot the frost had melted long before they reached the little tray on the side of the car window . " Another ? "  |p109She  jumped . She had n't realized she 'd drunk it so fast . " Yes , " she said , " I would . " He laughed . " You 've got more moods than anybody . The first time I took you out you sulked and hardly said anything . " " I did ? " She could remember that evening . " You were something of a creep . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real fine time . " " I like it over here . " " Where 'd you live ? " " My father had a place on the Tickfaw , and I used to stay with him in the summers . " " Still have it ? " " It was sold when he died . " " Oh , " he said . " Well , drink up and let 's go find the owls . " As they walked to the car she said , " My father was a remarkable man . " He winked to soften the words . " Doris always said that sooner or later you always started talking about him . " To hell with Doris , she thought . Aloud she said : " He really was . Anybody will tell you that . " " Except your mother . " " She thought he was dull . " They got in the car . " She thought he was quiet and dull . Like me . " There was that wink again . " You 're not quiet , " he said. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to follow it . They turned along a series of rutted sand roads and bounced slowly along between crumblingfences , undermined by honeysuckle and yellow jasmine . Under the scorching sun the perfume rose in heavy waves . " There it is , " Michael said . It was a low house , with a porch on all four sides , a wire fence all around and chickens running loose inside the yard . " I 'll wait , " she said . He was gone a long time . The sun got unbearably hot . She left the car and walked over to the shade . She made herself comfortable , leaning against the rough bark of a big oak . Little lizards rustled up and down around her shoulders , but she did not move . She glanced at her watch , wondering what she would be doing if she were back at school . After a few minutes a couple of rice birds began to fight in the top of the tree and she leaned her head back to watch them . All around was the close , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michael came back , finally , carrying two stuffed owls . An elderly man followed , carrying one more . They put them in the trunk , after first wrapping them carefully in newspaper . Joan wandered over , scuffing her sandals in the loose dust of the road . " Only got three , " Michael said to her without turn/ing around , " but Aunt Lucy will have to be content with a lopsided library . " They finished putting the owls away and slammed down the lid . " Thank you , sir , " Michael said to the old man . " Good evening , " Joan said . The old man blinked his pale blue eyes rapidly . " You do n't remember me , " she said , " but I remember you . " " You was smaller , " he said accusingly , " last time I seen you . " " I was younger . " " Anthony Mitchell 's girl . " She grinned . " Remember how we used to live just a way over there ? " He rubbed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people named Voorhies these days . Been sold twice . " " I heard about that , " she said . " Changed hands lots of times , " he said , " not many people want that kind of place nowadays . " Michael was standing listening , looking puzzled . Joan turned to him . " It was a real big place , " she said , " with a boathouse on the bayou and an artificial waterfallin the front lawn . " The old man laughed softly . " Cutting grass all the time , two boys , never did seem to get caught up . " " It was fun in the summers , " she said.  | " They never did catch him , " the old man chuckled and turned back into the house . " Never did . " " No , " Joan said to the bent crooked old back , " he just died . " " Let 's go , " Michael said . And when they started off , he asked : " Who did n't get him ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard about that , " he said , " but I forgot . " " From Doris ? " " To hell with Doris . " " I do n't want lunch , " she said , " but I would like anotherbeer . " " Soon as I can find my way out of these damn roads . " They found a bar ( a new one this time ; she did not remember ever seeing it before , and she liked it better because she did not ) . This time she waited . He came back with a dozen cold cans dripping in two paper cartons . " I did n't think you 'd mind , " he said , " but I thought we 'd drive on up a little farther . That old guy back there told me about another owl that I could buy . " " Sure , " she said . " You drive and give me the opener . . . . Where is this place ? " " Leesville road , but a little off it . " " Sure thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be back any special time . Even Aurelie is n't home . " She settled down against the cracked leather seat and watched the bright sky and thought a little more about an idea that had occurred to her . It had appeared quietly , about half an hour before , while she had beenp113leaning on the big oak tree . She felt the car turn off the hard-surfaced road , but she did n't bother looking around . " Open me another can , old girl , " he said . She did , scarcely noticing . The dust was heavy in the air now , and she sneezed . " These fucking roads , " he said softly under his breath . She kept perfectly still , letting the idea drift in and out of her mind , playing with it , turning it round and about with a touch of her mental fingers , imagining it a wind harp . She lost track of time . It must have been quite awhile , because her throat was dry and nasty tasting from the dust . ( She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were five empty cans lined up on the top of the dash . ) The car braked to a stop . She saw Michael hunched over the wheel , too furious to curse . She sat up . They were at the end of a rutted weed-filled road that looked as if it had n't been traveled in months . Directly ahead of them was the house , a small peakedroofhouse , its windows boarded with broken planks , its door yanked off so that a small black hole showed on the front . It was abandoned , that was for sure , and it had been that way for some time , because the fast impatient creepers had already inched up the side of the house and pushed through the boards of the porch . " Things go to pieces so quick around here , " she said , as if that would explain.  | " For God 's sake . . . the old bastard had it all wrong . " " Maybe he did n't know . Or maybe he thought it was funny . " " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said , " and stop fretting . We just go back the way we came . " He managed a grin . " Might as well . " " Bring the can and we 'll go see what 's inside . " There was nothing inside , except a great many lizards that fled as they approached , and gigantic sleepy roaches , shiny black in the light . The empty house and the soft gloom was solemn , and a little frightening too . It was all the childhood tales of haunted houses . Vague horrors looked out from the bare , paint-streaked walls . They stood a little closer together , even when they stood in the sun of the weedgrownyard . " What do we do now ? " It was n't so much a question as an invitation . And her own idea that had been hovering about her eyes . . . . She laughed aloud , a delighted tinkle , which surprisedeven herself . She had never heard that sound before . " What 's so funny ? " " If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've got a blanket rolled up nice and neat in that trunk . " " I always carry a blanket , " he said.  | " And back up on the side there , " she pointed , " there 's a stand of lovely pines . And nothing grows under pines , no brambles , no bushes . Just needles , all soft . We could take a rest up there before we go on back . " He stared at her for a minute . " I 'll be damned . " " Unless you 'd rather go right back . " " No , " he said , " I just wanted to be sure I had it all straight . " He got the blanket . In the pines it was soft and clear . And fragrant smelling under the quiet hot day . The light was gentler too  --  not the purple light of the old closed house , but the soft filtered light of a bedroom with shades drawn . They must have slept because when they next noticed , the locusts had started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a raging hunger in their stomachs that told them plainly that they had not had lunch . Joan brushed back her dress and ran a quick comb through her hair . Michael folded the blanket and they walked back to the car , silently . The shadow of the house stretched across the weed-choked yard now and reached right to the parked convertible , flowing over it like water . And when they got in , Joan noticed that the leather was almost cool to her hand.  |p116THE  next morning she changed her route to school . Almost without thinking , she shifted her path . It meant an extra-block walk in the summer sun , but it also meant that she need not pass that one particular building . It seemed to her the only polite thing to do . She did not see him on the campus . And he did not call . She had not expected that he would . It had n't been that important . And that was June.  |p119WITH  the first sign she told herself severely , Do n't be silly . So she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still unbelieving , for another three . One morning , one still clear morning in early September , she woke up . Suddenly . It was quite early . Her clock had stopped but she could tell by the light that it could n't be much more than five o'clock . She lay looking at the papered ceiling , crisscrossed with little cracks and stained with faint beige mold . And the truth that she had forgotten passed slowly in front of her mind . Fred 's been careful , and I 've been careful . Except for once . Just once . How silly . She did not feel alarmed . She was merely curious . This is how you tell , she thought . It 's a feeling after all . Heavy and lazy and smug and full . And how big was the child , she wondered . It would look something like a shrimp , or a piece of seaweed . She did n't feel tired , or sick . Just content.  |p120God  , she thought , I must be the motherly type after all . She twisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to sleep . When she woke again , the feeling of well-being was gone . She felt very busy . She was not alarmed . There were certain things to be done and she was all impatient to get to them . She had a quick shower and dressed with more speed and decision than usual . She made up carefully and put on lipstick with a brush , the way she almost never did . When she was finished , she looked up Michael Kern in the phone book . He was listed . She was vaguely surprised . But of course there was no reason why he should n't be . She took a straight chair from its position against the wall and brought it over , so that she would n't muss the fresh starch of her cotton skirt . Sitting primly and straight , she dialed the number . He answered almost at once . She recognized his voice , muffled and angry . " I woke you up , " she said , " I 'm sorry . " " Who the hell is this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joan Mitchell . " A pause and a yawn . " Hi , honey bunch . " " Can you get dressed ? I 've got to see you . " " Oh God , " he groaned softly , " not now . " " Yes , now , " she said gently , " I think it had better be right now . "  | " I 've got to shave and I was up late . " " I wo n't come up , " she said , formally , " if you 're worrying about that . " " Nine o'clock on a Saturday morning  --  God ! " " Do you know the drugstore right on the corner of Carrollton ? It ca n't be more than three or four blocks away from you . " " Sure , " he said flatly , " I know it . " " It 'll take me half an hour to get there , " she said , " on the streetcar . " " I 've got to shave . " " That 's plenty of time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't if it was n't important . " She hung up then , before he should say more . She recombed her hair , shook a quick dash of cologneon her skin . And left.  |p122WHEN  she got off the streetcar she opened her umbrella : she had a block to walk in the sun . The silk protection felt safe and tight . The heat filtered through the pale beige and turned to a soft glow around her shoulders . I should wear more beige , she thought , it 's a good color for me . A beige silk would be nice . And what was the name of that . . . . Tussah silk , that would be it . It would be expensive , but it would be so flattering with a soft skirt and just a hint of petticoat underneath . In the drugstore the usual clutter of shelves and counters and paper pennants overhead . And an odor that was a mixture of camphor and disinfectant and toasting bread . The usual kids , aimless , school-less , perched on the stools at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She glanced down the line of tables . Michael was not there . So she selected one in the middle and sat down carefully . " Coke , " she ordered ; then , " No , iced tea . "  |p123The  shiny black table top was almost hidden by doodles : JBF 1 SWR and a phone number UP6784 and vague geometrical designs . She sugared her tea carefully and asked for extra pieces of lemon and ignored the waitress 's grimace . She was sipping away with methodicalslowness when Michael Kern arrived . " I did n't really expect you to be on time , " she said . He looked fresh and starched ; his hair was very wet and showed the marks of the comb . " Mysterious phone call , mysterious lady . ' What else could I do ? " He was in better humor , she thought ; but then nobodyfelt good when they had been yanked out of bed , not for the first minute . His face looked pink and freshly shaved . " You use a straight razor , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he corrected . " I meant not an electric . " He shook his head , looking puzzled . " You see , " she plunged along , " I could tell . You 've cut yourself . " He lifted a hand to his chin . " No , " she said , " way back on your cheek . By your ear . " He touched gently . The blood had dried . " It 's nothing , " she said hastily . His coffee came and he winked at her over the cup rim . " Now what 's going on , mysterious lady ? "  |p124She  looked down the straws into the lemon-cloudy tea . She felt that this was n't the way to go about it . " I 'm pregnant , " she said . She did not look up for a couple of seconds . His face when she saw it was completely expressionless . She went back to her tea , sipping slowly . I 've told him , she thought , now he has to say something . " Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how are you sure it 's me ? " " Because it 's the only time nobody was careful . " Now he was staring at the milky coffee in the purplish-blueplastic cup . " Good God , " he said slowly , " just once . " " We forgot to be careful . " " I thought you would be . " She smiled with one corner of her mouth . " I did n't expect anything that day , you remember , and it is n't the sort of stuff you carry in your purse to school . " Now that they had started talking about it , she felt better . There was no longer the problem of beginning . For better or worse , they had started . There was nothing to do but follow along . " It 's not anybody else , with me for the fall guy ? " " I keep telling you , " she said patiently . " And the timing is right . " " God , why did n't you think about that then ? " " I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever does . Then . Only after . " p 125Seaweed child , she thought , floating about , having iced tea at a Walgreen Drug Store with yellow and red paper advertisements waving overhead . . . . She looked up and read them off silently : Milk of Magnesia , Bayer Aspirin , Creo Mulsin for Colds . " You were smiling , " he said . " For God 's sake why ? " " It 's such a strange place to be talking about this sort of thing . " " Worse than under some pines ? " " No , " she said quietly , " I guess every place is strange . " The waitress was looking and he ordered another cup of coffee . " What do we do ? " She looked over the store , out at the lazy half-empty midmorning store . " I was asking you that . " He started to run his hand through his hair , then rememberedit had been freshly combed , and lit a cigaretteinstead . " Well , " he said , " if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess I am . " And he added bitterly , " Even if I 'm not , nobody would ever believe it . " " You are , " she insisted quietly . " You want to get married ? Girls always want to get married . " " I do n't know , " she said , " I had n't thought about it . " Her answer seemed to confuse him . He was quiet for a moment . But she could n't tell from his face what he was thinking . " Or , " he said , " you could go away and have it . Some-where. "  |p126Floating  child , she thought , do you feel the pull of the moon , do you feel tides ? Do you feel the sway of a walk down the hard pavements ? " Or , " he said , slowly , " you could get rid of it . " " Yes , " she said , " I know I could . " Some little kids were standing at the ice-cream counter . They were arguing over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Joan watched them in silence . One yelled for chocolate , her sister for coffee . They finally settled for strawberry . Michael seemed to feel that he should say something . Joan felt him shifting in his hard seat . " Look , " he said finally , " do n't get me wrong , or anything like that . " " Oh no , " she said hastily and politely . " Let me finish . . . . I 'm not running out on you , or anything like that . If you want to get married , God , we 'll get married . " " Yes , " she said slowly , " we could do that . " He shook his head . " I do n't know , " he said , " but it seems to me like you 're awfully calm . For this . I thought gals got upset . " " I 'm not upset , " she said , " I just do n't know what to do . " " Damn'dest thing . . . . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither , " he said with a sour smile . She just nodded.  | " We can get married , you know . Maybe it would n't be too bad . " " Do you know how big it is now ? " she asked abruptly . " What ? " " The child . " " No , " he said , " it ca n't be very big . " " No . " " Did you hear what I told you ? " " Yes , " she said , " let 's get out of here . " As he paid the bill , she said : " I 'll go now . I 'll let you know in a couple of days . " " Okay . " She touched his shoulder , gently , casually . Just the way you would tell a small boy good bye . And on her way out she stopped and bought a pack of chewing gum.  |p128AURELIE  was gardening . Not that she knew one plant from the other . But her yearly trip to the mountains of Tennessee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And it was lovely . They wore wide hats and puttered around the shady part of the gardens , by the rhododendrons . And every hour or so a white-coated butler brought them glasses of iced tea , sweetened with rum or bourbon , and they rested on the little benches and looked out across the valley to the nearest ridges of the Smokies . Aurelie was jealous . It was part of a lady 's life , this gardening ; and it was a part she was missing . When she got home she had promptly ordered a set of copper gardening tools from Hammacher Schlemmer . They arriveda week later and the box , unopened , had been lying on the top of the refrigerator in the kitchen . This morning , passing it , she knew she could no longer put off . So she got on her gardening outfit  --  whitep129shirt and full-skirted denim jumper . It smelled faintly musty because it had not been used since last year  --  but the air would soon take care of that . She looked over the garden . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surveyed the handkerchief-sized back yard , the narrow strips on each side of the house , wide enough only for a brick walk and ribbon-sized edging beds . She selected the east side finally , because it was shady . Settling herself on her little gardening stool , and giving her hair one final clean-handed pat , she began grubbing around the roots of the blue hydrangeas and the violets . Joan came back from the drugstore , walking slowly in the noon sun . Her starched dress was beginning to wilt and there were dark splotches of perspiration across her back . Her petticoat stuck to her legs and she yanked at it as she entered the house . She stopped in the kitchen , grunting good morning to Clara . She found an orange and ate it , sucking it through a hole in the skin with loud noises . Clara kept silent until she was almost finished . Then she said : " You mother hear you , and she go right through the roof . " " I 'm a grown woman , " she said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Okay , woman-grown . " Joan finished and tossed the skin into the garbagepail . " Where is my mother ? " Clara grinned secretly out the kitchen window . " Gar-dening. "  | " Where ? " " Outside . Where else you find mud ? " Joan slammed the screen door behind her . She heard the steady chink chink of the trowel and followed it to the east side of the house . Aurelie did not look up . She kept right on jabbing the trowel into the wet earth . " Such pretty tools , " Joan said finally , " seems a shame to get them dirty . " " Just hold them under the faucet , " Aurelie said in time with her jabs , " and they will be good as new . " " As a matter of fact , " Joan said , " they 'd look kind of pretty sitting alongside a window garden . You know  --  herbs or something like that . " " An herb garden . " Aurelie studied her own right hand , which kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've never thought of that . " " You just sliced up a worm . " Aurelie glanced down . " Nasty things . " " I 've got to talk to you , " Joan said . " Wo n't it wait until lunch ? " " No , " Joan said . " Oh child of my heart , everything will wait a few hours . " " I 've got to do something , " Joan said , " and I do n't know what to do . " " Nonsense , " Aurelie said , " young people always know what to do . " " There are a couple of things I could do , " Joan said , " and I want to know which one . "  | " There 's another worm , " Aurelie said , " dear me , the ground must be full of them . " " It 's the violets , " Joan said . " They 're always around violets . " She added : " I 'm pregnant . " The little trowel stopped jabbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've eloped ? " " No , " Joan said . A hummingbird swooped into the narrow passage , was frightened by their figures , and swooped out frantically . " You 're not secretly married ? " " No . " Aurelie got off her canvas stool , collected her tools , and carried everything into the back yard . She placed the stool neatly in a corner of the kitchen porch , then rinsed the one muddy trowel under the garden faucet . She put the tools carefully away in their rack on the wall , next to the barometer . She took off her gloves and hung them over the railing . She started inside , then abruptly turned back and wiped dry the one trowel , polishing it carefully on her skirt . She checked the other tools . They were clean ; their copper winked and glistened in the morning sun . " All right now , " she said quietly . Joan followed her inside , into the little room that served as a study . Aurelie closed the door , firmly . " Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would prefer not to know then , " Aurelie said . " Poor Fred , " Joan thought out loud , " if I told him ,  |p132he  'd probably marry me right away on the chance that it might be his . " " There will be none of that , " Aurelie said very firmly . " No , " Joan said , " I was n't planning that . " Aurelie walked over to stare out of the window , even though the shutters were drawn tightly against the hot morning sun . " How long has it been ? " " Two months , " Joan said , " nearer three , I guess . " Aurelie inspected the closed blinds carefully again . I ca n't tell from her back , Joan thought , what she 's thinkingor feeling . But at least there 's no scene . I knew she would n't make a scene . " If it 's that long , " Aurelie said to the window , " something'sgot to be done at once . " " Yes , " Joan said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to hear . " I 'll call Ethel tonight . You can stop there .... " Joan thought : she always says stop for stay . " You have n't had a vacation , " Aurelie turned around finally , " so you 're going to spend a little time with your aunt . " " Yes , " Joan said . " It can be done easier at the Pass . " Joan leaned one shoulder against the wall . It 's all decidedfor me , she thought , I knew it would be . " How big do you suppose it is ? " " I have no idea , " Aurelie said coldly . " Why do n't you go pack a suitcase for a week at the Pass ? " " Right now ? "  | " Tonight 's train , " Aurelie said , " or tomorrow 's . " Joan shrugged . " Sure . " Aurelie said , " You wo n't go trying any homemade remedies , child . " " I know , " Joan said , " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Aurelie said dryly , " you have a small amount of common sense left . " Back in her room , and alone , Joan thought : it should have been more dramatic , somebody should have yelled . It 's so casual , and easy . Aurelie stopped by an hour later . " The evening train will be fine . Ethel will meet you . " " Thanks , " Joan said . And then : " What will you tell Doris ? " Aurelie arranged her lips into a straight , patient line . " Why ? " " I just do n't want her to know . " Aurelie kept looking at her . How much could she guess , Joan wondered . But she could n't . She could n't possibly guess . Joan kept her face empty and calm . After a moment Aurelie said : " I do n't see why Doris should be told any-thing . " " She 'll find out . " " Oh honestly now , " Aurelie said , " do try to be a little bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for that sort of thing . "  | " She 'll find out , " Joan insisted . " Mon Dieu , " Aurelie said . And left . To her back and the closing door , Joan said again : " Thanks though . Thanks a lot . " She remembered the rest in a kind of daze . She felt curiously left out . Everyone else moved with such purpose . They all knew what they were doing and they did n't bother to tell her . Looking back , she saw that it reminded her of the school ballet when she had been perverse enough not to learn her steps . Then the stage was filled with people going about their business , whirlingabout . And she stood , one foot stepping on the other , nervous hands clasping and unclasping behind her back . It was rather like that now . She did nothing . People moved about because of her , but not including her . She did n't know what to do . At first it annoyed her and then she gave up and contented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was much happier that way , watching the plot unfold , like an observer . She took the three o'clock train . At six she was emergingfrom the embrace of her great-aunt Ethel  --  tall , thin , gaunt in her old age , but still striking and with a startling resemblance to Aurelie . " My dear , how well you look , " Ethel said . " You do n't change a bit , " echoed Joan . And in the car ( the same 1929 Rolls she had boughtp135fifteen years ago ) Ethel said the exact same thing to the chauffeur that she had been saying for years : " Do n't go fast , Peter . We have nothing important to do . " How many times had he heard that ? Joan wondered . But he probably did n't even listen any more . " It 's been such a long time since you 've come over , " Ethel said . " It 's been ages . " " I know , " Joan said , following her lead obediently . " I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew you were coming , " Ethel went on , " I had to call up Roger and tell him you 'd be here . " She had almost forgotten him  --  a tall thin man , who was in the lumber business somewhere along the coast . " And of course , " Ethel went on , " the moment he heard he just begged me to have you save him the Yacht Club Dance . He 's been perishing for a glimpse of you . " " Oh yes , " Joan said vaguely . " So he 'll pick you up around nine . " " Tonight ? " " Dear , dear , today is Saturday . " Joan hedged nervously . " I am sort of tired , though , and I 've got a slight headache and I really thought I would just curl up early tonight . " Ethel 's eyes flashed a warning at her . She had made a mistake . " Oh really , dear , you ca n't miss the most important thing of the summer . And I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope not . " So that was it , Joan thought . She was going to be indisposedfor a few days with a cold . . . . It would takep136only a few days , of course . She kept thinking of it as more of a problem than it really was . " I 'm just dying to go , " she lied aloud , " and I do n't suppose it could do any harm . " " As long as you do n't get chilled . " And there it is , Joan thought , all fixed for me . " I do like to see the young people have fun , " Ethel said . " It reminds me of my youth . You would n't believe it , you youngsters , but I was nineteen once too . " " You 're not old , " Joan said , properly . " Oh yes I am , " Ethel said piously , " but I love to see young people have fun . I really do , deep down in my heart I do . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climbed the stairs to her room she noticed that her legs ached . And they never had before . Her back bothered her too , as if she had been carrying something heavy and had almost strained it . And why did she feel that way , she wondered , groggily . There would n't be any weight to the child . Not yet . And there would n't ever be . She was sleeping heavily , snoring gently with her mouth half open , when there was a knock on the door . " Go away , " she muttered . Her aunt came into the room and shook her shoulder . She had to open her eyes . The curtains were still drawn and the room was dim . " What time is it ? " she asked stupidly. p 137 " Almost seven , " Ethel said . She was making it sound like a picnic . The undertones said so clearly : if you do n't hurry you 'll miss all the fun . " I have n't had any sleep , " Joan said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eyes slowly . Her aunt was walking around the room , busily , opening curtains . " Your clothes are all ready . Rise and shine ! " Joan stumbled out of bed , falling over her own feet , stretching endlessly as her joints snapped . " Oh dear , " Ethel said . " I do hope you 're not going to be arthritic . Those joints sound suspicious to me . " She handed Joan her clothes , keeping up a line of patter as she did . " We do n't want to keep them waiting . They 've been so very nice to do things on short notice . " Who ? Joan thought . For what ? Then she remembered and there was a little tremor like fear in her stomach . " But today 's Sunday , " she said , " I did n't think it would be Sunday . " " One day 's as good as another , " Ethel said cheerily , handing her a pair of stockings . " No , " Joan said , " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a pair of sandals from the closet herself . There was a little wicker basket , like a purse , standing on the dressing table . Joan did not remember seeing it before . " You can put a few things in here , " Ethel said . " Few what ? "  | " Mercy , child , " Ethel said , " brush your hair . " I 'm not a child , Joan thought fiercely , so stop calling me one . I 'm a woman and I 'm carrying another generationinside of me . A tiny point of life , a floating point of life . But she said nothing . And Ethel did not seem to noticeher rigid defensive stance as she went right on calmly packing the little wicker case . It was too full . She had to empty it and start over . Joan stared at her as she filled the bag ( more carefully this time ) with a bedjacketJoan had never seen before  --  she herself did n't own one  --  a bottle of make-up , a box of powder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cologne , unopened . " L'Heure Bleu , " she said , " how I love that myself . Even an old woman like me , I use it all the time . " Where did they come from , Joan thought : jacket and perfume . Does she have a special supply for relatives in trouble ? Ethel closed the basket . " Ready ? " It was on the tip of Joan 's tongue to say no , but insteadshe nodded her head . Things seemed more like a play than ever ; nothing was going to happen ; nothing was real . They went down the long halls and the stairway , steep and black and empty . Joan was surprised to see how dark the center of the house was . She had never noticed it before ; there had always been lights on before  --  nottoo many , just a few well-placed bulbs . Discreetwould be the word.  |p139That  thought made her chuckle silently . Ethel really was the soul of discretion . Like having all this arranged early on a Sunday when none of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car was parked outside , in the drive , where it always was . Joan giggled again silently when she saw her aunt slip behind the wheel . Ever , ever so discreet . Her aunt drove rapidly with a kind of grim concentration . They turned away from the Gulf and headed north . The roads were empty at this hour and Ethel drove very fast . I would n't have guessed it , Joan thought . I would n't have thought she 'd tear along . . . . And why does she keep Peter to drive for her ? The seat was hard . Joan shifted uneasily . Ethel noticedthat . " It is n't very comfortable , is it , child ? " She smiled a grim winter smile without taking her eyes off the road . She dodged a large grey rabbit that crouched in the right lane . " Only the chauffeur and the footmen were supposedto sit up here . " " Oh , " Joan said . They hit a particularly large rut . Joan caught herself with both hands against the dashboard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , apologizing to no one in particular , " there are some crossroads coming soon and somebody might just be out . " It was a foggy morning , warm and close . There were black streaks of mosquitoes too and lots of night bugsp140were still out : they spattered against the windshield with popping sounds like tiny rocks . It did not occur to Joan to ask questions . Not until she was tucked into the high hospital bed with the harsh sheets scratching her body and the unfamiliar bedjacket over her shoulders . It seemed kind of silly then to say to her aunt who was just leaving : how is it done ? and , does it hurt ? and , when will they do it ? It seemed so silly to ask that of her aunt whose thin voile-covered body stood patiently by the bed . She had just finished stacking a great pile of new magazines on the little table . Where had they come from ? Joan wondered . She had n't noticed them before . " Now , " her aunt said matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to have people for lunch . Did we forget anything ? " " No , " Joan said . " This is just fine . " Why did n't she ask ? Not even : how long ? But she did n't . And her aunt kissed her on the forehead and went out . Joan stared at the wall for awhile and jumped guiltily when a cheery little nurse popped in the door demanding : " How are we doing here ? " " Fine , " Joan said . " Must n't get blue , " the little nurse said , " after all there 's nothing to it , nothing to worry about . " " I was n't worried . " " Must n't just sit and stare , bad for the nerves and the disposition and it puts wrinkles in the pretty forehead . "  |p141The  nurse giggled , proud of her own joke . " Look at the pile of lovely magazines . " You can have them , Joan started to say . But the nurse only picked up one and opened it at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nose . Joan took it automatically . " That 's better , " the nurse chuckled . " That 's a whole lot better . " Joan held the magazine , not reading , but turning a page now and then , in case somebody else should pass through the door . Once  --  after a few minutes  --  she laughed out loud . That was when she remembered that she had forgotten to tell Michael . She had forgotten completely . And later , drifting off pleasantly enough , she thought of it again  --  forgot to tell him  --  and she giggled her way into unconsciousness.  |p142IT  was over then and done with . Joan came back to her aunt 's house at Pass Rigaud . The windows were open , and the same steady wind was blowing in from the Gulf and the same locusts were singing in the trees at the first sign of evening . The same sound that there had been at another house , a deserted house . ' With the thick stifling odor of pines in the hot hot sun . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And why do I do it , she thought , when it 's over and finished with ? And there was n't a breath of air that day ... . " I feel so tired , " she told her aunt . " I feel so terribly tired . " " A rest will be fine for you , " Ethel said . " Good pine air after that awful damp in New Orleans . " And she had the sleeping porch made up for Joan . Without asking her . Joan moved out there obediently . " This will be wonderful for you , " Ethel said . " In the 143old days they used to say it was good for consumptives , too . " So Joan slept on the porch and heard the soughing of the pines all night , and woke to the sharp stifling smell of their needles when the morning sun grew hot on them . " I 'm cold out there , " she complained after the first night . And she took two blankets and a quilt out with her the next time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bag for warmth . It seemed to her sometimes that the wind blew right through her , echoed right through her . And it was in those long quiet nights , looking up at the stars through the haze of the screen wire , that she became aware of her body 's emptiness . She had always thought of herself as solid . A solid lump . Like a piece of mud or even a roast in the oven . But now she knew she was n't . That she was just a tissue of skin stretched around a frame of bone . Like a canoe or a tent . She had seen wind or rocks break them up , and it bothered her to be stretched so fine and delicate . She lay at night listening to the echoing emptiness inside her , caverns and echoing passages of bones , empty rooms and cages one after the other . She did not go out . She turned down each subsequent invitation  --  tennis , a quick sail , a moonlight swim  --  with almost the same words : " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Her aunt added an explanation for her when it wasp144necessary : " The summer flu  --  it is so hard to get over , you know . " Her face was thinner . Each morning darker circles under her eyes stared at her ; and each morning resolutelyshe covered them with make-up . " Dear child , " her aunt said one morning at breakfast , " that particular stuff gives you an absolutely porcelain look . As if you might break . " " I might , " she said , " I 'm crispy and brittle . " " Honestly child , you 've been ill , but there 's no need to take on . " And so ( she had a feeling her aunt arranged it , but she had never been able to figure out just how ) she begangardening . Or rather she spent hours crouched in the sun , running the soft sandy dirt between her fingers . Occasionally too she would take an old slaughter pole that she found stored up on the rafters over the garage and go down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was very shallow and she would watch the big blue crabs scuttle by . She never caught any fish . Once she hooked an eel , but she snipped her line and let him go . She did n't particularly care . It was the heat she wanted . The white sun pouring in through the straw of her hat , the white sun glaring up from the surface of the water beneath her . It was only in the full sun that she felt warm and comfortable.  |p145JOAN  stayed on the coast longer than she had intended . The endless , unruffled hot days stretched along . The brilliant white summer color left the sky . The clouds were piled higher and more fiercely than ever and the hurricane season approached . She had no word from the house on Coliseum Street . Sometimes she got a strange feeling that it was n't there at all . Aurelie called occasionally , she knew . Because Ethel would say casually at dinner , " Your mother sends you her love . " So she had telephoned . But Joan did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggest it . Fred wrote her once or twice , short gossipy letters , that did n't sound like him at all . Joan wondered what Aurelie had told him . She asked Ethel once : " What did Aurelie tell Fred ? " " Now , dear , " Ethel said . " I want to know . " The old eyes twinkled with something that was eithermaliciousness or amusement ( Joan could n't decide  |p146which  ) . " She told him the truth , of course  --  that you were very tired and nervous and a bit overwrought . " " Oh , " Joan said . Again the unidentified gleam . " A common complaint of young females . " As Joan sat on the end of the pier with her pole a few minutes later she rehearsed her aunt 's words . She knew then what they were planning to do . They were all going to pretend that it had n't happened . Her heart jumped around her chest crazily , like a bird fluttering . She wondered if she was going to faint . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing had happened . But it had . Of course it had . They had to pretend . Always . She studied the smooth yellow surface of her pole , running her index finger up and down along it . The fluttering stopped , and she felt steadier . How strange , she told herself . It must have been the sun . She did not realize she had spoken aloud until she saw an old man , who was fishing some dozen yards away , turn and stare at her . A few days later , as she came into the house , she found her aunt waiting for her on the front porch . Joan was drenched . One of the fierce quick afternoon thunderstorms had caught her . Her blouse was plastered to her , transparent as veiling , so that the outline of her bra showed . Her hair dripped behind her ears.  | " It was a hard rain , " Ethel said . " It seems to get harder each day . " " Yes , " Joan said . She climbed the steps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You go right in and change . " Ethel was wearing a purple print dress with little white ruching around the neck . An old woman 's dress . " I 've got a message for you , though . " " What ? " Joan asked . " Aurelie is coming in the morning . " " Oh , " Joan said . " Fred is driving her over . " " Oh , " Joan said . " I 've always wanted to meet that young man , " Ethel said . " After all , I really should meet my nephew-in-law at least once before the wedding . " Pretend that nothing has happened . . . . " Okay , " Joan said . " I 'll toss my stuff into the suitcase . " She gave a quick bright smile that missed Ethel somehow and flashed on a window and a bit of shutter as she turned to go inside . She had to stop a minute , dazzled as she was from the glare . And as she waited for her eyes to adjust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cool dusky hall . And that was how she went back to New Orleans , back to the house on Coliseum Street.  |p151THEY  came back on a Saturday . On Sunday morning Doris banged into Joan 's room . Joan had not gotten up ; she was lying on her side , studying the shape of her hand against the sheets , studying the nails and the littlehalf-moons at their base . " Welcome home , old duck , " Doris said cheerily . Joan looked up . As she did , she realized that her eyes ached . Their lids were heavy and swollen . Have I been crying , she thought suddenly . Was I crying in my sleep ? She scrubbed at her eyes . " God , I sleep hard . " Doris dropped down on the foot of the bed . She was wearing a white nylon robe , a birthday present from Aurelie , and her hard tanned body showed clearly through the filmy gauze . Her short blond hair was flattenedon one side , where she had slept , and her cheek still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rumpledand half awake , and the enormous collar of her robe was bunched up like ruffled feathers . She slapped at it once or twice , irritably . " Trust Aurelie to pick something like this , " she said . " This just is n't my style . "  | " Yes it is , " Joan said . " You should have a bedroom all mirrors and gold sea shells . Venus rising and that sort of thing . " " I know , " Doris grinned . " High-class whore house . " Joan sat up , feeling the familiar dizziness begin to sing in her ears . Then quite suddenly it stopped ; her head was clear and empty . Doris bounced on the foot of the bed , the filmy nylon fluttering over her body like clouds over rock . " So tell me what went on . " Sitting up , Joan did not have to open her eyes so wide ; she could forget how puffy they were and how they ached . " You know the coast , " she said carefully . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doris stretched out across the foot of the bed , arching her back , curling her bare toes in the air . " You do look like the wrath of God . " " I ca n't help that , " Joan said . " Who 's over there ? " Doris leered . " You 've been knocking yourself out with somebody . " " How do you figure that ? " " Some things Aurelie said . " Aurelie , Aurelie , Joan thought , you are so clever . You take such wonderful care of your children . Even Doris wo n't know . You did it all so beautifully . . . . " You always did like secrets , " Doris was saying . " Pity you wo n't tell me . Might even be somebody I know . " " Little sister , " Joan said , " there are some people inp 153this world cleverer than you , some people who can run rings around you . " Doris got up , the robe falling in tangles around her feet . " Not you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said truthfully . " I was n't even thinking of me . " That afternoon she called Michael . " Hello , " she said quietly , casually . " I 'm glad I caught you at home . " A pause while he identified her voice . Then a quick breath . " For God 's sake , " he said , " what happened to you ? " " Did you try to call me here ? " " No , " he admitted , " but you said you 'd call . " " Look , " she said . " It 's all right . " " You mean you were wrong ? " " No , " she said , " but it 's all right now . " " For God 's sake . " The silence was so long she began to wonder . " You are n't angry ? " " Me ? " he said , " I think it 's terrific . " It seemed to her that she ought to say good bye and hang up . There did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if she 'd used the wrong fork . " It was the sensible thing to do , " she said finally . " You 're damn right it was , " he said . " But I did n't think gals had that much sense . " What he said was true . Most gals would have wantedp154to get married . Maybe she should have gotten married . Then Michael was saying something else . " I did n't hear you , " she apologized . He laughed and she recognized the old sound , crisp and open and jolly . And free . She realized suddenly that he had been afraid . He had . And that struck her as funny . " You were afraid . " " No , " he said huffily , " I would n't say that . But I was n't very happy about things . " " Silly , " she giggled , " silly , silly . " " Yea , " he said , " I guess so . " For the very first time a conversation with him was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt she was in control . And she was . All because of a tiny speck of a child . " Tell you what , " he said finally , " this deserves some sort of a celebration , do n't you think ? " A celebration . Or a funeral . " Be fun , " she said aloud . " What about tomorrow ? " " It 's a good day . " " We 'll go have dinner at the Blue Room . " " Swell , " she said , " a proper celebration . " The next day a corsage came for her  --  white orchids . She was very dressed up : a new dress that she had bought the previous year on vacation in Jamaica  --  all heavy tropical greens and blues . She felt a little light-p 155headed , a little dizzy . She wondered if she was n't catchingsomething ; she took her temperature and then swalloweda couple of aspirins for good measure . In the club 's dimness , he looked even more handsome than she remembered . Narrow head , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and deep shadowsunder them . She felt lovely ; she wondered if she was . He had n't said ; he never said a word . He had never given her a compliment . The tips of the white orchids brushed her cheek  --  it did n't matter . This was Now , she thought , and have fun . " Thank you for the celebration , " she said . He took her hand across the table . " You were great , " he said , " so we ought to have a party . " " A birthday party , " she said . He looked startled . " Sure if you like . " A bottle of sparkling Burgundy came . And quite suddenlyshe thought of Aurelie 's decision : sparkling Burgundyis vulgar . " Poor Aurelie , " she said aloud . " I guess she knew all about it . " " Oh sure , " Joan said , " she did n't mind . Not really . " " For God 's sake . " He lifted his glass . " Here 's . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Later still they went down to Pat O'Brien 's , to a gay noisy airless room where two pianists belted out a sue/cession of indistinguishable songs . She ordered a gin and tonic . " Hell , " Michael said , " you want a Hurricane . " She shrugged . " I 'll get drunk . " " So you get drunk . So what ? " She nodded . Right again . If she got drunk  --  what could happen ? Nothing more can happen . Not to me . Joan could feel the man at the next table staring at her , admiringly . The dress was good , the flowers were good , and she had done her hair properly for once . . . . It was very thrilling . That 's what came of not being born pretty , she thought . You worked on it hard , and you were a lot more grateful . A lot more . More than Doris , for one . But Doris was n't exactly pretty , either , she had something else . It must be fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And without wanting to , Joan thought : but I had life too , right in my belly ; after a while it would have begun to move and stir ; and now I 'm empty and quiet .... Michael was tapping her arm . " Hi , honey bunch . " She smiled . " I was a million miles off . " " I know . " " Sorry . " " I hope you 're not going to be one of those sad-type drinkers . " " I do n't know . " A red-faced drunk staggered by their table , changed his mind and sat down . They both giggled at him . Andp157he began a long rambling account of his oil wells in Texas . Finally , in the middle of a sentence , he lurched away . Michael was chuckling , deep in his throat , quietly . " Do you suppose he was telling the truth ? " Joan asked . " God knows . " " If this is a party , " Joan said , " I would like another drink . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " God , you were terrific . If it had come out , I 'd be fired so fast I would n't even see the door slamming . " " Oh , " she said , " oh . " " Well sure . . . . Things like that just do n't happen in the academic world . " " Well , " Joan said , " it 's all right . " " I 'll drink on that , " Michael said . " I 'll get us a drink . " The room got more crowded . There was more noise , but it actually seemed quieter to Joan . The din had all subsided to an even low level roar . Far off and steady like a waterfall . She recognized the signs ; she was gettingvery drunk . When , several hours later , they left , she noticed that her heels were n't too steady on the broken flagstone that formed the sidewalk . She found herself staring down , selecting each stone carefully . Michael did not take her arm . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off.  |p158In  the car he said : " Let 's go one more place . " " Sure , " she said . " Where ? " " Fairy joint . Out at the lake . " I do n't want to go to the lake , she thought . I 've been to the lake with you . And it was a terrible time . Aloud she said : " Sure , let 's try . " It was a long drive to the lake , and the top stayed up . Just as well , she thought , the set would stay in her hair . The other bar was small and dark and not very crowded . They had a couple of beers and watched the show . Maybe it was the mixture of drinks , and maybe it was the mixture of sexes , but Joan began to feel very confused . She could n't tell men from women any more . A short slender dark-haired woman , with beautifully kept hair , and a very revealing beige dress , slipped past them on clopping heels . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an arm into Michael 's , hugged him . Then slipped away . Michael grinned . " Now what was that ? " " I do n't know . " " Man or woman , guess ! " " I ca n't , " Joan said . " No opinion at all ? " " Do you ? " " I know . " " Tell me ? " He shook his head. p 159 " That 's not fair . " The quick alcoholic tears were very near the surface . " What was it ? " It would be silly to cry , she told herself . And she stared determinedly down into the brown bottom of her beer bottle . " I could n't care less . " She yawned elaborately . " I 'm getting awfully sleepy and tomorrow is awfullyclose and I ca n't sleep all morning . " " If it makes you feel better , I 've got an eight o'clock class scheduled for the coming term . " " Eight o'clock , " she said . " God ! " " Nobody would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Have fun . " The road was very unsteady under her feet . The crunch of gravel seemed fantastically loud , seemed to boom out in the dark . She wondered if Michael could drive , all the stories of drunks at the wheel coming back to her with a rush . She took one quick look  --  he seemed to be driving with more concentration than usual , but he seemed to be doing all right . So she leaned her head back and fell to following her own thoughts around and around . They were n't makingmuch sense  --  even she could tell that . But very slowly one fact detached itself and stood out clearly . It was strange , in a way , that it had n't appeared earlier . She wanted him . Badly . She could feel her body twistingand lifting to that imaginary shape . Damn , she thought , oh God damn . Then they were home , and she walked up the frontp160walk with her legs burning and the familiar trembling on the back of her tongue . She fumbled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Automatically she stepped inside . He patted her cheek , roughly . Then he was walking back down toward the car . She could tell by his walk that he was very drunk . She called out after him : " Happy birthday . "  |p161SHE  climbed the stairs . She was a little surprised to find her legs working so smoothly . She stared down at her knees rising and falling under the cloth of her skirt as they pumped her steadily up . Without a sign from her they stopped working . She was startled and looked around . At the top , of course . How silly not to notice . She moved down the dark hall and it seemed to her that she walked several inches above the floor . She seemed to be drifting or sailing before a silent wind . If I took off my clothes , she thought , I 'd be light as paper and I 'd blow about . She felt her waist to be sure her clothes were firmly anchored there . Once safely inside her room she dragged a chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the sky . Horizon rise , she thought . And she turned her head sideways on her bent arms and rested on the sill.  |p162She  was very drunk and things did n't keep still . The soft muted colors of the earth and sky blended and shifted . Once she felt her stocking run , felt the little tickling down her leg . I ought to undress , she told herself . But she was very comfortable , so she did n't move . In the quiet , even at this distance , she could hear the trickling of the water on the tiles of the fountain in the front yard . I ought to be worried about my dress , she thought , and my girdle ought to be pinching me . But it was n't , so she kept very still and watched . After a couple of hours the alcoholic whirling stopped and she could make out the trees and their leaves as individualshapes and not just blobs of color . And the sky changed from a soft deep blue to the brilliant color of the coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor Mr. Norton , living upstairs , opening his windows each morning on the whisky-streaked world . Poor funny man . She had scarcely bothered saying hello to him . She found herself listening for the familiar sounds , knowing that she would n't hear them , knowing that the upstairs attic rooms were empty . She was going to have a terrible hang-over . That was for sure . The sun was up strong and clear and falling into her eyes so that she had to blink and rouse herself . She got up then , very slowly . And looked at the white orchidsp163in the hard light  --  they were limp and brown . She tucked them over her dressing-table mirror . Now the room would smell faintly of dead flowers , faintly like a funeral . A funeral , she thought and said aloud , " Happy birth-day . " She undressed slowly , standing in a patch of sunlight . Both her legs had gone to sleep , from the long hours in the chair . And they hurt . She moved about , slowly and deliberately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was left standing in the same patch of sun ( stronger and whiter now ) . She finished undressing and stood watching her body in the mirror , watching the shape and the color of the skin and the deep red marks that bra and girdle had left . She crinkled her nose at herself . It takes so long to grow back , she thought ; I did n't know they were going to have to shave there . But I did n't know anything about it . And anyway as soon as the hair grows back , there wo n't be a mark to show that it ever happened . Not a mark . And nobody will know . And nobody will be able to tell . But it does n't look nice now . It looks dirty and sick somehow , as if there were a disease . Or it looks a little like a mangy dog . And it 's no wonder Michael did n't want to come to bed with me , and me looking like this . He must know how I would look . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is so silly.  |p164I  wonder if he knew I wanted him as much as I did . I would n't like him to know . And it 's so silly . Body running away with you like this . Running you so fast you ca n't sleep . And all you can think of is the mark of a man . The stupid silly mark of a man . I 'm not making sense , she told herself , I 'm really not making sense . The sun was high now . There were stirring sounds in the street and a far-off rumble of traffic on St. Charles Avenue , punctuated by the sharp clank of streetcar bells . Clara came in , letting the screen slam behind her , and began rattling dishes in the kitchen . Familiar sounds . She had heard them a thousand times before . Now she could walk over to the bed . She stretched out on top of the spread . Her body was sore all over , no , not sore exactly , but tender , sensitive , and she seemed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its usual way , with sharp gusts of wind and grey sheets of rain . On the porches , leaves were jammed through screens like vegetables through a sieve . There were the usual hurricanes in the Gulf , hurricanes heading for the Texas coast . Once one passed so close that the gigantic neon clock advertising Jax beer ( on lower St. Charles Avenue ) got ripped off like a top-heavy flower . Coming down , it squashed two or three people , happy drunks who had come out of a nearby bar and were watching to see it fall . Between the storms were periods of brilliant Caribbeansunlight . Where everything shone with a desperatehard brightness , and the frenzied autumn growth shot forward . The golden-rain trees shook their hideous pink seed pods over the walks , and camphor trees dropped their greasy black berries . Some few superstitiouspeople still sneaked out when the moon was right and picked up the camphor berries and sewed them in a little plain cotton bag ; they wore them pinned onp166their slips and undershirts as a sure cure against fevers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her room and left them spread out in a little wrinkling black line on the back of her dressing table , the scent mingling with the soft fragrance of the perfumesAurelie gave her every Christmas and every birthday . She liked the way the scents clashed . It made the nights more comfortable somehow , when she woke and in the dark could almost feel the struggle of the camphorand the perfumes . Mr. Norton left the hospital . He came to the front and rang the doorbell , as if he had never been in the house before . Aurelie was not home ; Joan answered . " Good afternoon , my dear . " He looked very well . His skin , which was always very fair , had a healthy pink cast to it . His eyes behind the gold-rimmed glasses were very bright blue . He had gained weight and his cheeks were round and full ; one had a dimple . " I 've come to pack a few things , " he said . " Just a bag or two this time . I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steep stairs , patiently , stopping halfwayup to catch his breath . Not more than half an hour later he and the cab , driver were carrying down three large suitcases . They had been hastily and carelessly packed . Bits of material stuck out ; a plaid shirt sleeve dangled loosely and dragged along the floor . " Good bye , my dear , " Mr. Nor/ton said as they passed Joan . The suitcases made slight clinking sounds . Mr. Norton was taking his liquor supplywith him . That week too , Doris fell madly in love with a handsome Australian painter , whose name was Troy , who had wavy red hair , sun-browned skin , a thick red mustache , and an Oxford accent . He had a French Quarter apartment where the walls were painted black and the floor yellow and all the furniture was covered with a thick soft stuff like the skins of black lambs . He was also forbidden . Aurelie had ruled him unacceptable after their first meeting . Her objection was simple . She announced it very quietly to Doris : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they go with a man , not a fairy . " " I know all about that , " Doris said . " Anyhow he 's a bisexual . " " You are not to see him again . " " They 're the best kind in bed , " Doris teased . " Oh Mother ... " Aurelie 's eyebrows lifted and she held up a single finger . She did not say anything . Even Doris was silenced by the angry look in her eyes . Aurelie , who knew everybody and spent long hours on the phone , heard within a week that Doris and Troy were dating secretly . Aurelie never made scenes . Joan noticed nothing wrong until Doris banged into her room . It was thep168middle of the afternoon . Joan was by the window , paintingin the brilliant afternoon light . She had given up her sketching pad in favor of an easel and small bits of canvas . Joan sighed , put her palette on the window sill , and took off the tennis cap she wore as an eyeshade . " God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " It 's not , " Joan said . " What 's chasing you ? " " That son of a bitch ! " " Who ? " " Aurelie . " " In that case just plain bitch 'll do . " Doris threw herself down into the armchair , shaking a little side table as she did . A pack of cigarettes spilled to the floor . " What happened to you ? " " God damn . " All of a sudden Joan remembered . " Somebody told her , huh ? " " I 'd kill them , " Doris said softly , " if I knew who . " " It was n't me , " Joan shrugged . " What 'd she do ? " " No allowance . " " None ? " Doris nodded . Under the deep sunburn her fair skin flushed in spots , like damp blotches on a plaster wall . So that 's what she 's going to look like when she gets old , Joan thought suddenly . She 's going to be one of those ruddy-faced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she asked , " For how long ? " p 169 " Indefinite . " Joan nodded her head thoughtfully . " That 's tough . " " You 're god-damn right . " " Charge accounts ? " " I did n't ask , " Doris said , " but I 'd be willing to bet she fixed those too . " " She 's going to pay for college , is n't she ? " " A check for tuition made out to the college . " " This one really did it , huh ? " " Look , " Doris said , " you do n't know the half of it . I 'm supposed to play at Atlanta this coming week end . " " A tournament or something ? " Doris tossed herself about in the chair , so hard that the wood squeaked . " I can take it without any trouble . I 'm bound to . " " Why 'd you go with him ? " " Who ? " " The guy . What's-his-name ? " Doris shrugged . " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've got to go . I 'll die if I do n't go . " " Sounds to me like Aurelie really means this one . " " You 're telling me . " Doris pulled her knees up to her chin and examined them carefully . " And today I stumbledand skinned myself good on the courts . You would n't like to lend me some money ? " " If I had any money , " Joan said , " I 'd have taken a vacation . " " God damn it , " Doris said , " you 've got to have money . "  | " Do n't take it out on me , " Joan said , " you 're supposedto be fighting with Aurelie . " " I picked my father wrong , " Doris said quietly to the chandelier . " What I need is a nice rich crook like my sister 's old man . " " He was n't a crook . " " That is n't what the tax people said . " Joan knew she would give her the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know what was going to happen now . She gave up with a little sigh . " A house full of bitches . " " And that , " Doris said triumphantly , " is just exactly what I 've been saying . " " How much ? " Doris was rummaging around the top drawer of the desk . " Here it is . " She pulled out a checkbook . " How much ? " " A couple hundred . " She was turning the pages studyingthe stubs . " Say , " she said , " does n't tell how much you 've got . " " I 'll have to call Robert D'Antoni and ask him . " " Call him right now . " He had been her father 's lawyer , a short pudgy man with great rolls of wrist fat showing under his cuffs and swollen fingers that could scarcely hold a pen . He , hated Aurelie with a quiet determination and had no use for her children , excepting always Joan . He enforced the provisions of Mitchell 's will with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face-to-face , thenp171on the phone , and finally , when they could no longer bear each other , by letter . He and Joan had lunch once a month , a quiet ritual , a memorial to her father . " No , " Joan said , " I do n't have to call him . I 'm sure I 've got that much . " " I can hardly wait to see Aurelie 's face when she finds out I 'm going . " Joan wrote the check . " I wonder how much you owe me by now . " " Ask D'Antoni . . . . God he hates us . " " I suppose he does . " " Hell , old duck , " Doris said , " we 're all living off your old man . " " I know . " Doris folded the check and put it in the pocket of her shirt . " It really is a house full of bitches . " " I know , " Joan said . For the brief period between the closing of summer camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came home . Joan met two of them in the hall  --  Phyllis and Celine . They were twelve and fourteen and had grown so over the summer she scarcely recognized them . " When did you all get in ? " " Last night . " They had been at camp together and they had got in the habit of giggling and talking together , like the twins in Alice 's Adventures in Wonderland . " We did n't see you at dinner last night . " " I was n't there , " Joan said.  |p172It  was one of her new habits . She no longer ate dinnerat home . Or if she did , she ate very early or very late  --  after even Clara had gone and the kitchen was empty . All the sisters were home for a week ; the house rattled and banged with their presence . Then they were gone . Only the two oldest , Doris and Joan , remained , and the house settled down . " All these girls , " Aurelie said aloud to the quiet house , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weddings ? " Because she was lonesome and feeling the subtle tugs of age , Aurelie made peace with Doris . It had come upon her so suddenly . One morning she was looking in the mirror applying make-up  --  and there it was , her face staring back at her . The lines that had always been there but she had not noticed them , not really . And the eyelids that were beginning to be just a bit puffy and a little too dark . And the beaked French nose that was a bit narrower and already a good bit like a corpse 's sharp bill  --  she shuddered and told herself firmly to stop . She went on with her make-up , methodically , because she never allowed anything to stop her routine . But she felt slightly nauseated and quite afraid . To cheer her- , self up , she made a series of appointments at the very best beauty salon . She also forgave Doris and restored her tiny allow/ance when she started back to college . Joan registered too , though she had n't really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came , she found herself walking over , studying the catalogue and filling out the forms . She did n't take a regular degree course . She picked her courses at random , and kept choosing them until her schedule was filled . She was n't interested . It was just something to do . While waiting . She thought of that sometimes . Waiting for what ? And she did n't have an answer . Even for herself . Sometimes it seemed that she was waiting for the telephone to ring . She would find herself awake at night , listening hard . And sometimes she would pick up the instrument and listen to the steady buzz on the other end . She got asked to resign from her sorority . She had forgotten to go to three meetings . Aurelie was distressed . " That 's ridiculous , " she said . " I belonged to that sororityand you 're not going to resign . " Joan shrugged . " I was a founding member , " Aurelie said heatedly . " They ca n't do this . " Aurelie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proper people . Joan watched her go , with a tiny smile on her lips . Then she went up to her room , got out her typewriter and pounded out with two fingers her resignation :  |p174Having  learned in your organization the virtues and merits of the capitalist system , I now resign . Since I have only a certain sum of money for membershipdues , I must resign from your club and use that money to join the Communist Party . It is slightly more expensive , but will I feel be well worth it as an investment in the future . She signed the letter , and glanced at it again . It sounds crazy , she thought , and it is crazy . And what in God 's name am I talking about . There must be something wrong with me . I 've never heard of anybody in my family who was crazy before . But that is n't the sort of thing they 'd be likely to tell you . And I wonder . And the funniest thing of all is that I liked belonging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was fun . And I do n't want to stop just because I forgot some meetings . But Aurelie can fix it up . Aurelie always knows the right people . Aurelie can fix it . Daughters of founding members do n't get thrown out , no matter what they do . Aurelie will have it all fixed by tomorrow . And everybodywill forget it . Aurelie knows so many people . Fix up anything . And what do they do with the little shrimp child ? Red and stringy . What do they do ? Do they bury it ? But you could n't do that . It is n't a person . The grave of a shrimp , the grave of a seaweed . What to put on the marker ? And that would be silly . So down the toilet . And this stupid letter , this stupid silly letter. p 175Aurelie could fix it . Could fix it all . She read the letter again , carefully . Then sealed it , and made a special trip to the corner to mail it . A couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I do n't really know what to think . Why did n't you tell me you wanted to resign ? " " You found out , " Joan said , sadly . " You always find out . " While I 'm working hard as I can , you ruin the entirething . " " I do n't know why I wrote that . " " Why ? " Aurelie clutched the front of her green housecoat closer over her bosom . " My dear child , I am beginning to think there must be insanity somewhere in your father 's family . " " I thought of that , " Joan said . " I wash my hands of it , " Aurelie said , " the whole horrible thing . " " That 's all right , " Joan said , " I do n't mind really . Not much . Not really . " " Mon Dieu ! " Aurelie said . " Do n't feel bad about it . " From the startled look on Aurelie 's face Joan saw that she had profoundly surprised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p176THE  last days of September passed . Joan went to classes occasionally . She could see the way the other students looked at her now  --  a mixture of amusement and annoyance . A nut : they thought clearly . She shrugged and paid no attention . She scarcely talked to anyone , even people she had known long before . She still had her job in the library and she spent long hours on the top level of the stacks , alone , painfully reading book after book , not knowing a day later just what she had read . She had not seen Fred Aleman for several weeks . She had been out with him only once since her return from the coast . He called , regularly three times a week , but she still found excuses not to go out . " My telephone friend , " he called her , and she knew that he was not joking . Still , she put off the inevitable . And she really did enjoy the long bantering conversations . She just did not want to see him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Face to face she was afraid.  |p177She  did not think about the future . She did not allow herself to . Late one afternoon she was leaving the library  --  earlierthan usual because she was hungry . She had forgotten to have lunch . As she was halfway out of the Gothic door , she stopped , blinking into the light . She could see only the silhouette for a moment . But she knew that ; she would recognize that anywhere . " Fred , " she said , " I thought you 'd be working . " " I came up to catch you , if that 's the only way I can do it . " He took her arm and steered or pulled her into his car that was double-parked just outside . " I was going over to get a hamburger or something . " " No lunch ? " She shook her head . " I 'll take you over to the Azalea Grill . " They drove silently . Still silently they slipped into the bright red lacquered booth . Finally Joan said : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busy working . " She had a second 's private panic as she realized that she could not recall the title of the book she had just been reading . He did n't question her . And she relaxed , smiled a little and felt better . " It 's a real pleasant surprise , though , " she said . The hamburger came ; she doused hers with onions and relish and bit into it eagerly . " You really were hungry . "  | " Sure , " she said . He had only coffee ; he sugared it carefully and stirred it slowly . " Finish up your food , little animal , then I want to talk to you . " In less than five minutes she was done . " I was n't hungry , I was starving . " " Okay , " he said , " now listen to me . " " Before or after dessert ? " she grinned . " Be serious now . " He was staring right at her and she felt the same squirming sensation she always felt when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I think I 've been an idiot , " he said levelly , his eyes unblinking . His eyes fascinated her the way dark eyes always did : they were mirrors , they were surfaces , they were deep cones that went back to a tiny point that was where he lived . A tiny point way back in the middle of his head . " A god-damn idiot not to put some things together . " " How ? " she asked because she felt she had to say something . " When you went to the coast , " he asked steadily , " were you pregnant ? " Why does he have to be so direct , she thought . Why ask ? If he knows . " That was a long time ago , " she dodged . " So you were . "  | " This is silly . " " Do n't you think you could have asked me something about it ? " He thinks it 's his . . . and maybe it is . Maybe . Just maybe . Stranger things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was . Because it 's gone . It was n't anybody'sbut mine , and it 's gone . " I went off for a little vacation , " she said , " just because I was tired . It was n't anything so dramatic . " " It fits , " he said , " it all fits . You were kind of strange before you left , and you 've been very strange since you came back . " " How strange ? " " Withdrawn . . . . Like you were waiting for some-thing . " So he 'd noticed it too . . . . And what was she expecting ? What was it ? " I do n't mean to be strange or anything . " " You little idiot , why did n't you ask me ? " " There was n't anything to ask . " He went back to his coffee , stirring the weak brown liquid slowly about . " Looks like you 're about to poach an egg in that , " she said irrelevantly . " Well , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courage for one thing . " " No , " she said , " I 'm an awful coward . " " But you did n't have to . "  | " There was n't anything to do . " " But you would n't have done it if you had n't wanted to , I guess . . .. " " I did n't do anything . Anything at all , " she repeated patiently . He was n't listening to her . He was thinking out loud . Thinking old thoughts . Thoughts he had run through the projector of his mind so often they were fraying at the edges and the words were memorized and familiar . " I guess that was n't any way to start . . . . So I guess you were right . " She drank her water slowly , only half listening to him . " You gave yourself a pretty awful beating , you know . You look tired . And older . " " It 's the weather , " she said . " I hate this weather . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together , when it should n't have . But I am sorry . " " Look , " she said , " everything 's fine . Nothing 's wrong . Nothing at all . " " Sure , " he said . " Do you want to go home ? " " No , " she said , " just drop me off at the library . "  |p181THE  following week Joan bought herself a car , a secondhandblack Pontiac . " My dear , " Aurelie said with horror when she saw it , " you 're not going to leave it parked out front ? " " Where else ? when we have n't got a garage . " " Could n't you park it farther down the street ? " " Okay , okay , I 'll move it . " Doris looked at it carefully . " And I had to pull teeth to get two hundred , " she said softly . " Rich bitch . " After that first day Joan kept the car parked around the corner . And in a way she preferred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she drove away . Not that it mattered whether they knew or not . They would never have thought of stopping her . But they might have asked idly , to make conversation , " What are you doing , where are you going ? " And questions would spoil things . Joan floated  --  not happily , but not unhappily either  --  suspended in space ,  |p182unham|pered  , able to move at will . Like water , she liked to think . The secrecy was necessary to her . She wanted to move without anyone knowing she was moving . She wanted to slip like a ghost through walls . That was one of her recurring fantasies  --  that she was a ghost and slid through doors and slid through trees and crept into houses and watched what happened there . ( For with this new urge of hers went a great curiosity  --  a curiosity about little things , about details of living . ) She had taken to leaving by the back steps , the narrowtwisting flight that not even Clara used any more . The single overhead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replace it . She had to feel her way , carefully , her arms stretched out on both sides of her , palms resting on the walls to guide her down . One day she was absolutely startled to meet Aurelie with Doris , flashlight in hand , coming up . " Mercy sakes , " Aurelie said , " you 'll break your neck , child , without a light . " Joan backed up again without a word and let them come up . The stair was far too narrow to pass . " Were you going through in the dark ? " Aurelie asked . Joan just nodded . " Cat 's eyes , " Doris giggled . Aurelie shrugged . " Do n't break your neck . And by the way it will be about half an hour before the steps are dry . "  | " Sure , " Joan said , " sure thing . " It was not until she was groping her way down that she realized what had happened . They had waxed the regular stairs . Of course . She could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been smelling it all along without noticing . And they thought she had noticed . So they did not know . She was so relieved that she stopped in the middle of her groping and grinned triumphantly to herself . They still did not know that she used this way regularly . They still did not know . . . . She felt like laughing . She felt like sitting right down and laughing . She still had her way out . She had slipped it by their very noses . She was still free . To come and go unnoticed . In secret . Not that she knew why . . . . She did n't bother to ask herself that . It just was and that was all . She kept her job in the library , asking for the late hours that none of the staff wanted . She liked the quiet still emptiness , where each step , however carefully rubber-cushioned , echoed right through the building . She liked the way  --  at closing  --  the lights went out , tier after tier , first the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all the corridors . She found she could move just ahead of them , as she would have done before a coming tide . She would stand at the door of the stacks until those lights blinked and disappeared . She would move to thep184door of the reading rooms and wait the five minutes there . Then , moving slowly , she would time herself to be just at the front door when the hall lights blinked out . She rarely missed . When she did , she corrected the timing by a few seconds ' conversation with the watchmanwho stood waiting to lock up . She would find herself going down the wide outside steps , in the soft warm fall night . She would go down them without any hesitation , because she knew them so well . And she would turn down the sidewalk , walkingslowly to her car . She always parked several blocks away , deliberately . She walked slowly , purse swinging idly in her left hand , her heels making tiny sounds on the cement . She followed the paths through the dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She made her walk as long as possible : she liked the feel of the dark , of the little night wind , of the smell of the earth , the leaf mold cooling after a day 's heat , of all these things around her . And her alone . She rather liked being alone , it gave her a sharp clear feeling . This is me , she could say to herself in the dark , and for the first time she would know exactly what she meant . She did not have to figure herself in relation to other people now . And in the dark  --  on the shadowy benches , in the doorways of the Gothic buildings  --  she could hear the quick shuffling and shifting of the couples as she passed . Sometimes , because her ears were sharp , shep185could hear their whispers off in the distance , sharp hushed little whispers  --  before they heard her steps and fell silent for her to pass . Sometimes , hidden by a tree , she would stand stockstilland listen . As if she were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night came back . And it seemed to her then that the whole dark was full of couples , the building , the bushes , the shrubs , the trees , even the leaves overhead . Soft wet sounds . That stopped when she moved again . When she finally got to her car she would snap on the radio and see her hand outlined in the little light from the dash . And she would feel clear and hard and definite . It was a very comfortable feeling . Though it would then be a few minutes past eleven , she rarely went directly home . Instead she went driving . The car had given her a feeling of new mobility and looseness . She did not care particularly where she went . She chose streets because she liked the way they looked . One night she turned down only the widest avenues , palm-fringed and littered by the falling seeds of tremendousgolden-rain trees . Another night she drove along the narrowest and darkest back streets , dirt rutted , littered with cans , where Negro faces peered at her and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got home before three . Usually too she stopped off at the Azalea Grill for a hamburger . Withoutthinking she would find that her circling ended inp186front of its chromium counters , and she would come blinking from the dark into the brilliant blue fluorescentglare . One afternoon , in the very first weeks of October , she had just wakened and was stretching idly in bed , when Fred called her . They chattered a bit . Though she was aware of something else in his voice , she was too sleepy to isolate it . Finally he asked directly , " Should I call you again ? " She was startled . " What ? " " Would you be happier if I did n't call you again ? " " I do n't know , " she said , imitating a yawn , and stallingfor time . " I just woke up . " He was not going to be put off . " Would you miss it if I did n't call you again ? " And she very deliberately said something that was n't true . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I guess I would n't . " " That 's what I wanted to know , " he said quietly . And hung up . She put the receiver back carefully and sat on the edge of the bed for quite some time , wondering : why did I say that ? When I know it is n't true . Why did I ? Why did I want to hurt myself ? She was learning to look upon herself as a separate person . She found herself observing her activities , beinga little surprised with each discovery . She regarded herself with interest and detachment , as if she were ap187strange zoo specimen of whose behavior she did not entirelyapprove . She found herself watching for Michael Kern . She had already done it several times before she realized what she was doing . Often during her night prowls she would pull to the curb , leaving the motor running , and listen to the empty streets or the sound of the lake . It was just one of the things she did . It did not particularly matter to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But this one time , a wet gusty night , she looked out of the window and read the number of the yellow stucco apartment building she had stopped by . She had never seen it before . It was on a side street facing a little park . The number was familiar ; she stared at it : 4608 . Done in flowing curving iron letters over the iron-barred door . She remembered . She had called Michael Kern just twice . She had looked him up in the phone book . Both times . 4608 Villere Street . That was it . She had rememberedwithout knowing it . She went over and glanced at the names over the long line of bells . She found his without any trouble . There was still mail jammed in the box . Which meant he was not home yet . She scurried off hastily , and back in the dark safety of the car realized that her hair was dripping cold streams of water down her neck . She had forgotten to use an umbrella.  |p188She  sat very quietly for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into place at the side of the building . And a hunched figure dash for the door . She was not sure who it was , until he stopped and fumbled for his mail , holding a cigarette lighter as he unlocked the box . Then he was gone into the depths of the building . She waited patiently to see what light went on . The third floor on the left side . It was n't a very deep building . All the apartments must run from front to back , so their rooms would be strung out in a long straight line . Like a shotgun house , she thought , only an apartment instead . And what was it like inside ? She wished she had seen it . Now she wished she had . What were the rooms like ? How many were there ? Were they furnished with the usual wicker and chintz , or did he bring his own stuff ? And were the owls still there ? Or had he sent them on to his aunt ? The owls , the stuffed owls . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly . A couple of nights later she was back at the same place , knowing now how she had come there . The lights inside were on this time ; the curtains were n't drawn , though it was too high to see . She studied the two bars of light , blurred in the drizzle . Yellow radiance in the mist , little glow like yellow smoke , drifting out . After about ten minutes she saw him come out . This time he was n't alone . There was somebody with him ,  |p189somebody  tall , wearing a bright green raincoat . Whose high heels clattered as they ran across the rain-soaked sidewalk . When they were gone , she stared into the splattered windshield . Drops , dribbles , drops , dribbles , she thought nonsensically . Dribble dribble toil and tribble . And she laughed out loud at herself . She sat very still , letting her eyes see the patterns of dark and light , not thinking of anything at all . Drifting . Like seaweed . She would n't go to the beach any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleek green fish in shallowstony streams . . . . She did n't notice until the flashlight touched her face . She saw the shiny black raincoat first , then the shiny visor and the shiny badge . " You in trouble , lady ? " Then she saw the prowl car pulled in right behind her . " Goodness , " she said , " you startled me . " " You in trouble ? " " No , " she said , " mercy no . " " Look , " he said , " it 's not exactly the safest place , alone in a car . Things happen . " She smiled her best finishing-school smile . " That 's why I leave my motor running . " The officer shook his head . " Sounds kind of crazy to me. "  |p190She  chuckled softly . " It is . " " Why this block and this same spot ? " " I guess you noticed me here before . " He nodded . " Before I get myself shot for a suspicious character . .. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words to use . The man was waiting patiently . She could n't see his face . " Look , " she said , " it 's like this . I had a boyfriend and we broke up , not much more than a couple of months ago . Not that much . I 've been waiting to see if there was a chance for me . Until tonight he 's come home alone . Only tonight there was a girl up there . So I know he 's got a girl . And that 's what I wanted to find out . " The harsh rough words she had used made her feel better . Things cleared and shifted back into a sharper focus . Being tough and cheap made her feel happier . She lived for the moment in a world where such things happened all the time , were a part of life and nobody noticed . Nobody thought anything of it . " Look , " the policeman said , " go on home . " " I will , " she said , " but I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So you 'll know . " " Lady , " he said patiently , " take it easy . " " No guns . . . . Anyhow , he ought to be nibbled to death by ducks . " She giggled . " But I want to find out who she is . " " Okay , " the man said , " okay . " " Nothing wrong in that . Perfectly legal . "  | " Sure , " he said . " Do n't let it get out of hand . " " I 'm not exactly the type who goes wading around in blood up to my knees . " " You never know , " he said and went back to the patrolcar . That struck her as so very funny she chuckled all the way home . She had found a way out now . Whenever she felt the quivering shaking uncertainty coming near her , she would go off by herself , where there was no one to hear . And she would say her little story out loud , using the crudest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the images , graphic ones that struck her imagination . She told the whole thing aloud to herself . The quivering would stop and she would feel better . She would feel fine . A week or so later , Joan saw the raincoat , the green raincoat , tossed over a chair in the ladies ' room at the library . Beside it were two books . Joan recognized them as freshman English and math . She flipped one open , glanced at the name written across the flyleaf in crisp bright green ink . Then she sat down in the next chair , rummaged in her bag for a lipstick , and began methodicallyredoing her make-up , waiting for the owner to emerge . She came finally , a tall thin girl , with shingled black hair and pale lipstick and heavy eyes . She slipped into the green raincoat , belted it , picked up the books . Shep192hesitated , turned back to the mirror , snapped open her purse and ran a tiny comb through her unruffled hair . Then she checked her teeth for lipstick and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " I could n't help noticing that raincoat . I think it 's the loveliest I 've ever seen . " The girl looked surprised , then smiled . " I 'm sure there is n't another one like it in town . " " As a matter of fact , " the dark-haired girl said , " I got a dressmaker to run it up from a coat pattern . " " Do you mind . . . " Joan touched one finger to a sleeve , brushing lightly . Smooth and curiously warm . As if it held body heat . " It 's Japanese silk , " the girl said . " Good heavens , " Joan persisted , " it is lovely . " " Well actually , " the girl gathered up her books and purse again , " it is n't too practical ; it is n't very waterproofand I have to race between buildings to keep from getting soaked . " And from buildings to car , Joan said silently to the closing door . Joan went back to classes . And under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about catching up . I 'm not stupid , she told herself . I can do it . Working so hard kept her on campus most of the time and she could see the green raincoat pass back and forth . She kept track of it . The way you 'd keep track of a timber in the surf . Loosing it for long periods , seeingp193it finally bob to the surface again . But you keep trackingit because you want to avoid it . And you always know most about the things you have to avoid . It drizzled for weeks . Grey days streaked by the passingof a bright green raincoat . Without knowing it , without willing it , Joan got to know more and more about the girl . She knew which dormitory she lived in , that her classes ran from nine until one , that she had a psychology lab on Wednesdayafternoon . That Michael picked her up after the lab ended at five o'clock ; that they went out to supper . That they had three dates a week , which was all freshmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cool clear days of late October began . The green silk raincoat disappeared . It was harder to keep track now . Without the coat she blended in with the other girls . So Joan took to waiting for them . She knew the freshmancurfew hours ; she parked her black Pontiac at the corner of the dormitory and waited . Whenever a watchman passed , she slipped down in her seat and the Pontiac was just another parked car along a public street . Anyway , the watchmen never looked closely at the cars : they were nearly always full of necking couples . Afterward , she followed Michael back , saw him in his door . She felt very protective toward him ; she could sleep better knowing that he was safely at home . She did not bother to think about it , she did not :  |p194analyze  . She only knew that after she had seen him home she was quite peaceful and curiously happy in a quiet way . It was Aurelie who suggested the psychiatrist . She did it one morning  --  as things always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakfast . She popped her black-framed reading glasses over the edge of the morning paper and stared straight at Joan . " Why do n't you see Cousin Oliver , if you 're not feeling well ? " Joan was idly squirting the juice from half-peeled sections of an orange . She was trying to outline the flower pattern on her plate . " Me ? " " If you are not feeling well , " Aurelie said , " I think it would be a very good idea . " " I feel fine . " Aurelie folded the paper carefully and laid it beside her own plate . " You have n't had a date in months . You come and go all hours of the day and night . " " I happen to want to study , " Joan said self-consciously . " I 'm just tired of wasting my time around here . " " You come and go all hours of the night . Alone . " Aurelie shook her head . " For a young girl . . . Somethingis wrong . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Now that is rude . " " I 'm not crazy . " " Something is bothering you . " p 195 " Just because I do n't want to be a featherbrain and an idiot like all the people you know . . . . " Aurelie shrugged . " For your sake . " " You try to lift yourself , just a little bit , and everybodyaround here thinks you 're crazy . " " A young woman without an escort late at night , " Aurelie made a face of horror . " No escort , " Joan said furiously , " and you do n't have to keep fighting him off to defend your virtue . " Doris chuckled softly . " That is quite enough , " Aurelie said to her . " I would rather not go out with the slobs around here . " " Mercy mercy , " Doris said . " Leave the table , " Aurelie said . But she was looking at Joan , and Doris went on quietly finishing her breakfast . With her finger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ center of the plate . " Oliver is crazy . " " He is a very brilliant man . " " Oh shit . " " That , " Doris said , " is my line . " Aurelie glared at her younger daughter . " It must be my blood , " she said to no one in particular . " You all had different fathers and you all came out the same way . The exact same way . " " Not like her , " Doris giggled , " do n't tell me I 'm like her . I could n't stand it . "  |p196Joan  did n't bother answering . " I think you should , " Aurelie repeated to Joan . " If my habits bother you , " Joan said formally , " I can always leave . " Aurelie sighed . " Back to that . If your idiot of a fatherhad had any sense he would never have left you that money outright . " " But he did , " Joan said , quietly triumphant . " He was an idiot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aurelie sighed . " Dramatics , " she said , " I hate dramatics . Go away and let me finish my coffee in peace . "  |p197AFTER  a few days Joan no longer waited for Michael at curfew time by the dormitory . She joined their eveningsearlier , followed them more closely : when they met , on the walk outside Tilton Hall , she was watching . She followed them clumsily at first , then with practicemore and more easily . For the next few weeks she trailed them about the city , silently , patiently , matter-of-factly . She did not feel upset , or angry . She felt patient ; as if in a way she were only doing her duty . It seemed to her sometimes , as they formed an unknowntrio , that they should leave marks in the night , like jet trails . Telltale marks . That would repeat aloud that the couple was not a couple after all . That there was a watcher . When she thought about it , it struck her as funny that she should be so happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think about it very often . She had trouble only once . When she was waiting for  |p198them  outside the Sahara Club , parked quietly a half block away , a man in a light suit had tried to open the sidewalk-side door . It was locked ; she always kept them locked . He stood rattling the handle , while she hesitated . In a sudden anger , he began kicking the door , hard . She shifted quickly , and drove off . For a few yards the man held on to the door , lifted his feet and coasted along , stuck to the side like a monkey . But as she gatheredspeed , he dropped off . She saw him in her mirror , standing at the side of the highway , brushing off the front of his light suit . She drove down a bit , circled and came back . She made one quick trip through , checking to be sure that the convertible was still there . Then parked again , this time among the necking couples in the back lot . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door , she was waiting and followed them back . That Saturday they went on a sailing party . Joan recognized the boat . She had been on it several times , some two years past . It was an old Biloxi lugger , rigged as a party boat . Its hull was unpainted and scuffed by years of hard use . But its deck was screened , and all the cabin partitions had been pulled out to make one large room . It was n't seaworthy any more , but it had a very large ice chest , a very fine radio , and a more or less reliableengine . They chugged out past the yacht club with the radio going full blast. p 199Joan watched them over the horizon , then , as she stared out at the thin line of lake and sky , broken now and then with the little peaks of sailboats , she realized something . She had noticed , of course she had noticed , she just had n't understood . Until now . During the last few days they had begun sleeping together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had watched them too long and too carefully not to noticethe slight difference now . A certain ease . Their figureswere no longer wire tense . As they moved , they swayed gently , ever so slightly , tending together , delicatelytouching but not really touching . She knew it now . By five that afternoon it was clear that they were not coming back for supper . Joan went home . She showered and changed into a bright yellow dress and tossed a bright yellow sweater around her shoulders , because the evenings now were cool . She had a slow supper  --  alone , for the house seemed to be empty . How funny , she thought , I do n't even know what they 're doing any more . She finished , piled the dishes in the sink and drove back to the lake . Freshmen , she knew , on Saturdays had the same curfew hour as everyone else in the dormitories. . . two o'clock . So the boat would be coming back around midnight . She got to the harbor at eleven . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blaring of the radio and she wondered if they had bothered to turn it off at all during the long day . Then shep200heard the groan and rattle and thump of the engine . Finallyshe saw the chipped white hull swing into the circle of light from the clubhouse . And she heard the noisy mixture of voices from the deck . When the convertible pulled away she was in no hurry to follow . She knew where they would have to be going . She got to the dorm a few minutes behind them ; the parking places were filled . She felt a sudden panic . There was the convertible . She thought she could see heads in it , but she was n't sure . And passing so close , she did n't dare stop . She drove past , letting the tail of her eye catch a dark hump that might have been a coupleor might have been a steering wheel , or a coat thrown over the back of the seat . She turned at the corner , into the campus , and found a parking place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and slippery walks . As she came around the corner of the building , at the top of the little rise , where the lawn sloped off down to the street , she saw the convertible move off , with a brisk impatient gunningof the motor . She was out of breath ; she turned back into the shadow of the trees and sat down on one of the benches . It was a cool night , clear and crisp . At the street entrance to the dormitory there was a flurry of cars and flashing lights and muffled voices  --  as girls and their dates rushed to make the deadline . She did not know how long she had been sittingp 201there  --  she no longer wore a watch  --  but her breathing was regular now and calm . In the dormitory the lights were off too , except for the little ones burning in the lobby and along the halls . A watchman sauntered past her , humming under his breath . In spite of her light dress , he did not see her , for the bench she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She sat there very quietly , thinking about nothing , listening to the night birds and the sounds of little animalsmoving . It was nice to be outside , and alone , when everything else was dark and sleeping . Gave you the feeling of being the only one alive in the world . Your breathing was so loud . And you held your breath to see what it was like when you were n't there . After a bit , when she got cold , she stood up and began to walk to her car . She left the paths and cut along in the shadow of the bushes , moving noiselessly . It was a trick she had learned when she was a child , spending summers with her father . It was part of a game of Indiansthen , and the chauffeur , who was a redbone , half Indian and half Negro , had played patiently with her . . . . She could do it perfectly now . She left the night silence like water unruffled behind her.  |p202THAT  same night she wrote the letter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small machineand typed it out . She did know that she sat very still over it for a long while , staring at the typewriter keys , scratching with her fingernails at the smear of bright red nail polish along the top of the machine . The keys had polish on them too ; she had always tried to type just when her polish was new and wet ... . She had carried the letter around with her for a whole day . A long white envelope in the bottom of her purse . Gathering lint and bits of tobacco and the scents of different perfumes . A faint smell of leather . Edges beginning to grey just a bit . Then , quite suddenly , she passed a mailbox and almostwithout thinking , she opened her purse and dropped in the letter . And that was that . The letter said , in two lines : Do you think your parentswould be interested in hearing that you are having an affair with M.K. ?  |p203As  she had expected , there were no more dates . She watched for a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dark streets and parked alongside the dorms . In the early days of November , steady heavy rains beganas they always did , bringing in the first of the winter weather . She wore boots now and a raincoat and carried an umbrella and when she stepped through the library door , that door was snatched out of her hand . When she walked , she walked leaning against a wind . She still parked her car at the far edge of the campus and as she went along , leaves and bits of branches would be tossed down at her , pasted against her oilcloths by the force of the rain . And where were the couples now , she wondered . Where would they go ? The rain made her feel terribly old . Old enough to be their mother . Old enough to be through with the hot drive of mating . Old as the wet earth under her bootsoles . She felt herself get stronger and stronger . Felt each muscle along her skeleton stretch and flex and tighten . Firmer , harder , impenetrable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she reached her car . How could I ? Her mood changed . She was no longer impenetrable ; she was light . Easy and drifting.  |p204I  can remember , she thought , when I was born . A lot of swirling waters and a beat like surf pounding . And do you remember dying afterward ? Like that . A circle . Slipping in and out of life . And did an embryo remember dying ? Did my seaweed child remember ? Drifting and surf pounding . . . . Empty inside and lonesome . Caverns and caves , echoing . The Holy Ghost now . Or the Shower of Gold . . . . Being one is so lonesome . With another heart ticking away inside . A different beat . A ragged pattern . The littleticking heart . The soft floating seaweed bones ... .  |p207A  SUNDAY in November . The bleak bare desolate look of a southern winter . Joan had been up early , had looked out , and come back to bed . She spent the day there , not bothering to eat , listening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Muted , not quite real sounds . At five o'clock , when she was sure he 'd be home , she called Fred Aleman . " I just wanted to apologize . " She did not bother saying hello . " I 've been being a monster and I 'm sorry . " She hung up quickly , before he could say anything . The flowers came , as she had known they would , about an hour later . Aurelie herself brought them up . " You make up with somebody ? " " Yes , " Joan said , " Fred . " " That 's nice , " Aurelie said vaguely . " Do you feel all right ? "  |p208Joan  almost giggled at the sly eyes darting around the room , looking for some sign of disorder . " Some sort of bug , " she said , " kept me still all morning . " " Oh dear , " Aurelie said , " I just know it was left over from that Jamaica trip last year . " " I suppose so , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rocky . " " Some tea ? " " No , " Joan said , " nothing . " There seemed to be peoplecoming and going in the downstairs hall . " What 's going on ? " " Friends of Doris . " " Should n't you be down ? " " That , " Aurelie said , " is not polite . " " My stomach hurts , " Joan said . Aurelie left , closing the door firmly behind her . Joan opened the long white box across the foot of her bed . Yellow roses . She called Fred back . " Was there a card ? " he asked . For a moment she panicked ; there had not been a card . " No , " she said , and told the absolute truth , " but I do n't know anybody else who would . " " I 'm teasing you , " he said . " I knew you liked yellow so I sent them . " " Can I ask you to supper , " she said , " tonight ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said , " sure thing . " And she knew something else . That he had had anotherdate which he was going to cancel . She felt trium/phant . " Doris has the house full of screaming people , " she said , " but I think it 's just for cocktails . You want to make it about seven thirty so I 'll have time to cook ? " " Why do n't we go out instead ? " " Because . " " Because what ? " " Because , " she said firmly , " I 'm doing penance for being so nasty . " He chuckled . " Well , " he said , " you 're direct . I 'll be there . " No , I'mn not , she thought as she hung up . I 'm devious . All sorts of things , but not direct . She dressed carefully in a full-skirted wool print and went downstairs . She headed straight for the freezer and dug through the packages . She pulled out a pint of crawfishbisque , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a carton of green peas . She brought them back to the stove . Then because she felt suddenly hungry she fixed herself a cup of fresh coffee . There was a platter of small cocktail sandwiches on the table . She took two and ate them . She was leaning on the window sill looking out into the tiny back yard when the door swung open and Doris bounced into the room with a clatter of high heels and a swirl of bourbon . " For God 's sake , " Doris said , " the dead have arisen . " " Hi , " Joan said , " is it a nice party ? " " Fine party . . . . What are you doing ? " " Cooking . " Doris inspected the packages . " My God , Aurelie'sp210bisque . She 'll kill you for using that when she 's been saving it for a year in there . " Joan shrugged . " I needed it . " " You better hope Aurelie does n't need it . " " Did she go out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all dressed up . " " Bet anything she 's met somebody . " " Could be . " " Here we go again , " Doris said . " Another wedding . Why does n't she just sleep with them ? " Joan asked : " Is that crowd here for cocktails , or the evening ? " " Aurelie asked that too , " Doris made a delighted face . " We 're going before very long . " " Okay . " She clattered off with the platter of sandwiches . Joan got up and put the frozen bisque on to heat . She stood watching the flame and wishing the lump in her own stomach would go away . Fred came promptly , as he always did . The cocktail party was gone then and the house was still and empty . It was a charming house , Joan thought as the bell rang . Even the worn boards of the floor looked lovely to her , and the tall thin narrow windows looked dignified . She felt her grandparents and her great-grandparents lurking behind her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had Martinis . " The house looks so nice to me today , " she said . " It 's a beautiful house . " " I do n't always think so . " " Joan and her house on Coliseum Street , " he teased . " Anyhow , " she said finally , feeling that there was more said than they were actually saying and wanting to figure it out , " come talk to me while I finish dinner . " They ate in the dining room , properly , at a carefully set lace-covered table . " You 've been to a great deal of trouble , " Fred said . " I told you why . " " Damned if you did n't . " " Anyhow I want to talk to you . " " You 're so serious . " " I 'm not a good cook , " she said , choosing her words carefully , trying to feel out just the right approach for him , " and I do n't know the first thing about housekeeping . " She could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew what was coming . " But I guess I could learn and not be too bad about it . " " I guess so . " He was n't going to help her . He was n't going to help her at all . So she tried directly . " You used to want to get married . A while ago . Do you still ? " " I do n't get it , " he said . That persistent cold feeling . " Because I would like to get married . "  |p212He  still did not say anything . He was studying the epergne in the center of the table . " Maybe I waited too long , " she said lamely , " maybe you do n't want to . " He smiled at her across the table , suddenly . " It is kind of peculiar , you 'll admit that . " " Do n't laugh at me . " " I was n't . . . but I always thought that women wanted more moonlight and roses in the approach . " " We 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd been married four times from the way you talk , so that the whole thing was very business-like . " " I did n't mean it to sound that way . " " Poor baby , " he said , " let 's go get a bottle of champagne and celebrate properly . " She nodded , biting her lower lip . For some absurd reason she said , " I feel like crying . " That was true . " Now that , " Fred said , " is the only real true female reaction I have had from you all evening . " She sniffled , struggling for control . " I guess I wo n't ever know what happened to you , " he said evenly , " what changed your mind . But it does n't matter . At least to me . " Then because he had come so very close to the truth and because she did n't know what else to do she broke down and cried long comforting sobs.  |p213THE  winter slipped along . Aurelie watched the weather reports carefully and at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camellias with quilts and blankets and pieces of plastic . In the wider lawns the grass turned brown with a frost , grew green in a week , turned brown with the next . The last cluttery seed pods of the goldenraintrees got blown along the gutters and the sidewalks by the steady east wind . Children straggling along the streets on their way to school were beginning raggedly to sing Christmas carols . As Joan lay in bed in the mornings she could hear their monotonous chanting : " Jingle bells , jingle bells , jingle bells . . . . " Why , she thought , did they never learn any more of the words ? Each morning they sang the same thing . Each morning she thought the same thing . She dozed pleasantly , leaning on time like a cushion . Feeling it flow like water . It was an illusion she had sometimes , particularly inp214the morning . That she floated in a current , effortlessly . Time , the everlasting river . Things happened as she slipped along . But not to her . She could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned her head and looked to see what they were . The news of Mr. Norton was like that . The phone call came in the middle of a cold rainy afternoon . Joan answered . It was a woman 's voice , gentle , apologetic , asking for Mrs. Norton . " I do n't think she 's here , " Joan said . " Can I take a message ? " The voice coughed , very lightly . " Would you tell her that her husband just died ? " That was how they found out . Thin grey Mr. Norton had collapsed and died of a stroke while sitting on a bench in Jackson Square , feeding the pigeons . He went every day , rain or clear . On this day the square was empty  --  it was cold and drizzling . So it was quite awhile before anyone saw the raincoated figure that had fallen from the bench to the pavement . The park patrolman noticed him finally , noticed the great swarm of pigeons that circled and squabbled . Falling , Mr. Norton had broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bread crumbs , one of peanuts . And the pigeons were fighting over him.  |p215Aurelie  sighed and dabbed at her eyes when they told her , and went off to arrange for the funeral . " Dear dear , " she said , " I 'm afraid that comes of giving up whisky . " She also bought herself a black dress . " My very worst color . I look horribly sallow in black . " Joan refused to go to the funeral . " Do him up without me . " " I do n't think I 'll go either , " Doris said . And there was a flash of something that could have been fear in her face . " Honestly , " Aurelie said , " you girls have such bad manners . " " I 'm sure you can manage without us . " " Sure , " Doris said . " You wo n't need us to beat off the banshees . " Joan said , " Did you decide where you 're going to put him ? " That had been the other problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Tennessee , did not have a burialplot . " Put him in with Grandmama , " Joan suggested . Aurelie looked horrified . " That is my family tomb . " Doris chuckled . " Honey baby , he is your family . " But finally they found a separate little plot for Mr. Norton . Way in back of the cemetery , bordering along the L &N; tracks . Several days later Aurelie , Doris , and Joan went up to the attic apartment and gathered up clothes andp216linens and cleared out the closets , which were packed with empty whisky bottles . Drew the curtains and coveredthe furniture with old sheets . Books and charts and instruments and dress swords and uniforms went into trunks whose lids were slammed down and locked . Finally . " Well , " Aurelie said at the end of the day , " a sad , sad job . " Doris 's face gleamed with sweat . " If I 'd had to carry one more basket of empty bottles down those stairs I 'd have dropped in my tracks . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's really empty now , " Joan said . The traces of Herbert Norton were gone . There were just two large rooms , dusky with their shutters drawn , humped with sheeted furniture . They had been emptied . Finally and completely . When Aurelie and her daughters left , they locked the door behind them . The spiders and the mice could take over.  |p217JOAN  thought : the hurt will stop when I 'm pregnant . When all that empty space is filled up . For one flash second she thought : it 's a pity you have to have a man for it . It would be so much nicer if it just happened . If each time the little ovum burst out it carried a full child , instead of just half a one . If you could just say this is my child , and not just half mine . . . . She laughed at herself and stopped thinking that . I want to be great and round , she thought . And rest my hands on my belly . Folded hands resting and waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fill the world . Filling the world with your seed . Sending children out one after the other . Like meteorsflying off a sun . Children one after the other . Followingin the steps of that first ghost child . . . . Ghost child , lost child . Would they always follow it , she thought . Would they always be following that little piece of seaweed , red seaweed.  |p218She  dreamt about it sometimes . Could see it so plain : big-eyed and red , drifting in its ocean . And she always woke up , her insides churning with fright . She would have to put the light on and sit and stare at the bulb until the dry white light reassured her . Even so , after one of those dreams she felt vaguely frightened and upset all day long . She took a couple of Dexedrines to make herself feel better . And in the evenings there was Fred . They had dinner each night now . Sometimes he picked her up . Sometimesshe met him at his office . Her father had had an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the elevators , in the halls , she and Fred met people who would remember : " Anthony Mitchell 's daughter . . . . My dear , he had pictures of you all over his office . Not just one on the desk . Not for Mitchell . All over the walls . Named his boat for you too , or was it a horse . . . . " " I wish I had n't been so young when he died , " she told Fred . He just nodded . " You think that 's silly ? " " Well , " Fred said evenly , " it 's better to remember things than really see them . " " No , " she said , " it would n't have been that way . " She liked meeting Fred at his office , liked opening the frosted glass door that had his name on it , liked havingp 219the secretaries watch her , liked leaving with him , liked walking down the white corridors with him , the streaked marble corridors that looked cracked and dirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He skipped the handball he had alwaysplayed on Wednesday . He said nothing , and she did not ask . But she was quietly grateful . One evening she said simply : " I 'm tired of cars . Makes it seem so awful somehow and sordid . " So after dinner , each evening , they went directly back to his apartment . She had never been there before alone . She had always been ashamed . Now she did not care . Not any longer . They walked boldly in the yard and she felt her backbone stiff and proud . A couple of days later she stopped using her diaphragm . Fred said , " I think we ought to celebrate whatever makes you so happy . " She considered telling him , then decided against it . " I do n't know , " she said , " I just feel good . " It seemed to her sometimes that they went rushing straight from dinner to bed . Sometimes the speed botheredher . And she would make up little excuses : " Let 's go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they were there it was always she who was first ready to leave . Not Fred . I 'm like a bitch in heat , she thought . Shameless groveling bitch.  |p220She  nodded her head emphatically . Fred chuckled . She glanced up at him suddenly , her skin jumping with alarm . She had forgotten him . She blinked rapidly and looked around , remembering back along the evening . Trying to set herself securely on this tiny spot of time that she was occupying . Trying for balance , delicately like a dancer . They were in Galatoire 's , having dinner . The small noisy room , the mirrored walls , the dragonfly forms of the overhead fans , the cash register clicking in back ... She took a deep breath and was secure again . She had come here since she was a child . " Where were you ? " Fred asked . " I do kind of drift in and out , I guess . " " Anywhere I 'd be interested in ? " " No , " she said . They did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they were already married . Seemed that they had been together so close so constantlyfor a very long time . And sometimes she was surprised to find how happy she was with him . Surprised because she knew he was n't the right man at all.  |p221JOAN  told the passage of time by the marks of the short cold winter . She noticed the frosts and marked their brown lines on the banana trees , each wave cutting lower . Like a brown tide , but reversed . Each one cutting down the tree until there was only a bare staff jutting up . By summer they would be eight feet high again , with their drooping purple flowers and hanging clusters of bananas . She noticed the crisp deep blue of the sky  --  a sky that was never seen except for the short months of winter . She floated under it , and as she did , she studied it carefully . The way she studied all the things about her . She studied its brilliant deep unbroken color . Like bright blue china . Like the inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big teacup . For days after that she felt positivelyfriendly toward the sky . Familiar . The way you would feel toward a piece of china you had seen sincep222you were a child . The whole world was very peaceful and very quiet . And quite suddenly , it ended . Ended with the few seconds it took her to recognize the car.  |p223THE  street light showed it plainly . There was a convertibleparked in front of the house on Coliseum Street . A yellow Ford convertible , several years old . It was washed and polished . She had been in that car once . It was clean and washed when they began too . But the roads they had driven had left their dust on the hood and fenders , had left their sting in their eyes and their taste on lips . . . . It was so simple . She felt herself go deathly cold . All of a sudden . Like the last seconds of an anesthetic . She got out of Fred 's car steadily , easily . She heard her heels clicking on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard herself saying , " Doris seems to have a date . " Fred took her to the heavy lead-glass door . " A big Saturday night . " " Wo n't you come in ? " " Now that , " he laughed , " is a formal invitation.  |p224Maybe  they do n't want company . Ever think of that ? " The words might have hurt once . But not now . The anesthetic had taken effect . She was n't there any more . She put her purse and gloves on the hall table , under the lamp with the beaded fringe . She took off her coat and dropped it on the fragile Louis XIV chair that had been Aurelie 's wedding present from her third husband . She looked around for Fred , saw that he was not there . She wondered . ... Thinking hard , she rememberedkissing him good night at the door . The door to the little living room , the one that Aureliecalled the second parlor , was closed . There were voices behind it . Clinking glass and two voices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door . She did not quite know what she had expected . But she was surprised to see only a couple facing each other , shoeless feet propped on a coffee table between the two chairs . " For God 's sake , " Doris said . Michael wiggled his toes under their black socks . " Hi . " His hair was rumpled , standing straight up on top , itshair oil glistening . As if a hand had run through it . Hisvery fair skin had taken on a deep flush and his darkbeardline stood out stronger than ever against the pink . If I got close to him , Joan found herself thinking , I'dfind out that there 'd be a batch of little red veins ap/pearing around his nose . And spreading out across his cheeks . Like cobwebs . The radio was playing very softly in one corner . Joan turned her eyes to it slowly . Masses of strings were slithering slowly up and down . " It sounds like Frere Jacques , " she said irrelevantly . " Old duck , " Doris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Joan thought , I 've never seen her so drunk before . And her eyes focused on the tray right beside Michael'sfeet . A little round tray , two bottles and a pitcher of water . And an ice bucket . A silver ice bucket . . . . " That 's mine , " Joan said . " It is not , " Doris said . " You gave it to Aurelie . " She had , of course . Only last Christmas , with a burst of feeling , she had gone into a jewelers and asked to see the Danish silver . She had bought an ice bucket with ivory handles . When Aurelie said , " You should n't have , " she answered simply , " But I felt like it . " She had . Afterward though she wondered why . She did n't really like her mother very much . " Go away , old duck , " Doris repeated . And fluttered her hands , as if she was chasing chickens . Michael waved at her , mockingly , a child 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Doris said , " out . " Joan turned then and left . Only it was n't so much leaving as it was fleeing . She could feel panic shaking her body like a chill.  |p226She  got to the hall and sat down on top of her coat on the little Louis XIV chair . Somebody got up and slammed the door shut . Even through it she could hear them laughing . She sat perfectly still . After a few minutes she tipped her head back and rested it against the wall . She did not move again . She did not know exactly how long she sat there , not thinking , not listening really . Just waiting . And she did not know what she was waiting for . She did not move when she heard the steps on the front porch , and she scarcely turned her head when Aurelie opened the door and stepped into the hall , her deep laugh swirling around her like a flip of a scarf , carelessly . Somebody was with her , somebody stood just outside the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to annoyance . I ruined an entrance for her , she thought dully . " Child , child , " Aurelie said , " whatever are you do-ing ? " " Something wrong ? " a man stepped through the door . Even in the little half-light of the hall Joan could see him clearly . Short , stocky , balding , with the remains of blond hair cut close to his head . " You 're ruining your coat , " Aurelie said . Joan stood up , shook the coat and hung it across herp227arm . She nodded toward the closed door of the little parlor . Aurelie marched over to it , with her most determined step . The man followed her , more softly . He gave Joan a quick glance as he passed . " I 'm Joan , " she said quietly , automatically . " The old-est . " She had been identifying herself to Aurelie 's friends that way for years . She looked at the man more curiously as he passed close by her . He was very blond ; his skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little crisscrossing lines in it . He looks all right , Joan found herself thinking . I bet anything she marries him . . . . Aurelie pulled open the door . " For heaven 's sake ! " They were n't sitting apart any longer . They were together in one armchair . Joan turned away . " For heaven 's sake , " Aurelie said again . " I seem to have come home just in time ! " Joan went over and sat down on the lowest of the steps leading upstairs . She patted the carpet with one hand , slowly . That 's what she 's going to be , she thought , the highly outraged mama . Aurelie had been saying something else . Joan listened . " Leave this house right now . " A pause . " Shall I ask Mr. Bryan to help you out ? " Mr. Bryan pulled himself up , taking a deep breath , like a fighter.  |p228Joan  thought : strutting like a rooster . And Bryan is an Irish name . He looks like the sort of man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shame Aurelie ca n't have any more children .. . . Aurelie was saying : " I 'm just shocked . Just absolutely shocked . " Joan saw Mr. Bryan move over closer to Aurelie , protectively , so that his shoulder was almost touching hers . " Oh God , " Joan said softly under her breath . Michael got his coat on and walked to the door , with the exaggerated steadiness of the very drunk . " It has been a most pleasant evening , Miss Doris , " he mocked formally . Doris followed him . Aurelie stood perfectly still in the parlor door . Mr. Bryan stood beside her like a watchful poodle . Joan looked down at the outline of her knees through the thin silk of her dress . At the door Doris caught Michael 's arm and whisperedsomething to him . He gave a quick heel-clicking bow . Doris turned and leaned against the closed door . " Boy oh boy , " she said , very quietly . " Remind me to stick needles into you sometime . " Joan did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stairs . As she passed Joan caught a whiff of perfume . Mitsouko . It was her scent . The bottle was on her dresser ; she could see the round flat shape . Or maybe it was n't any more.  |p229She  turned and said to the climbing legs above her : " Did you take the bottle or did you just use it ? " Without stopping Doris turned her head , symbolicallyspitting to one side . Joan felt very tired . She put her head down on her knees and began to listen to her breathing . " Child , child , " Aurelie said , " you must be exhausted . Go on up to bed . " " Are you all right ? " Mr. Bryan said . Joan got to her feet very slowly . She brushed down her skirt , picked up her coat and gloves and purse . " We 've always had very bad luck with the men in this house , " she said calmly . " You have just seen the last example . " Mr. Bryan looked startled . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shell of a pecan , blinked once . Aurelie laughed . A true chuckle . Mr. Bryan 's eyes lighted up again . " I hope you do n't have many like that , " he said . " We all have bad luck , " Joan said , and went upstairs . " Even I have bad luck . And I do n't get many to have it with . " " You see , " Aurelie said to her departing back , " my daughters are all individualists . " " Yes , " Mr. Bryan said . But he sounded doubtful . The pecan-colored eyes might be just a bit darker . " Would you like a nightcap ? " Aurelie asked . Joan went into her room and closed the door.  |p230She  had been lying in bed quite awhile , lying across the bed , muscles rigid . She heard Mr. Bryan leave . Heard him whistle his way across the sidewalk and start up his car with a cheery roar . She heard him spin around the corner with a screech of rubber . I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Papa . And I wonder what he would say if I did . She heard Aurelie come up to bed . Heard the old pipes rattle with quick running water . Then the thick early morning silence . At a quarter past the hour a streetcarrattled past over on the avenue , rattled off into the distance with a hollow metallic jangle . There would be nothing more for an hour . An occasional car went by too , a light brushing sound of tires . But it was all very far away from the house on Coliseum Street . She got up and opened her windows , letting the clear cold air slip into the musty room . The house had a definite smell , she thought . And all the cleaning in the world would never get it out . Because it was n't a smell of dirt . It was n't a smell of cooking . Or of anything in particular . It was the smell of everything . Of everything that had gone on in the house for the past hundred and twenty years . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living that had gone on between the walls . The smell of the generations being born . Dying . And being laid out in the front parlor with a sprig of sweet olive from the door in their clenched hand.  |p231Peo|ple  left their smells behind them . It was almost like the paper you 'd cut dolls out of  --  the dolls were gone but you could see their shape and size and form . You could see just the way they had been . It seemed to her sometimes that she could hear them too . That they left little sounds behind them , echoing around the walls . Like faint rustly mice . Seemed she could hear the sounds of all their breathing . Left-behind breathing . Echoing . Gently , like leaves . Still dressed , she reached down and pulled the quilt over her . She lay and listened to the rustling of time past . Her musty grandfathers , echoing from the St. Louis Cemetery . And heard the rustling of the future time . And tried to understand it . And gave up finally , sadly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she thought . None of the things that have happened . They just came along . I did n't intend them . Time and things like a river , passing . Before me , she thought , and after me . Things will go on happening when I am dead . Pass around me and over me and go on . And instead of being frightened , she felt comforted . She had lain there she did n't know how long when she heard the footsteps . She heard them first on the cementof the sidewalk , then on the brick of the path . And in between she heard the slight rusty squeak of the front gate . She slipped out of bed , moving gently inside herp232clothes so that they did n't rustle and spoil her hearing . She got to the window and looked down . She saw nothing . She was too high and the space between the houses was too narrow . She would have had to lift the screen and look straight down into the deep dark of the pathway . She crouched by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over her . Like a river . Nonsensically she found herself singing , silently : we shall gather at the river , the beautiful , beautiful river . . . . That was all she knew . That was all she had learned . Aurelie did n't approve of her girls learning and singing Protestant hymns . The sound of uncertain steps on old slippery mossy brick : hollow sound of bricks set in cinder . Then a quick flurry , a rush , a grunt . Her ears pinpointed the noise in the night . She could n't see but she did n't have to . Somebody had leaped for the lowest rung of the fire escape , the iron fire escape that led to the empty attic rooms where HerbertNorton had once lived . And somebody caught hold of the iron bars , caught hold with a little hissing grunt and swung up . The ladder was a dozen feet from her window . Holdingher breath , she leaned against the screen and stared at the figure that emerged from the dark , climbing quickly , outlined against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still air . And she recognized it : Aphrodisia . He has good taste , she thought . He had not worn it the day they went across the lake.  |p233But  then , she thought , he had n't been dressed up then . It had n't been anything special . The fire escape passed close by the bathroom window , which Aurelie had always kept nervously locked . It was open now . Joan listened . And followed the little sounds through the bathroom , into the hall and back again into Doris 's room . Once she heard a muffled giggle . The wind ruffled the hair at the nape of her neck . It was very cold and she shivered . She held her hands straight out in front of her and studied the nails . But in the dark she could see nothing . All of a sudden she knew what she had been waiting for . She knew what she was going to do . Joan opened her own door , moved out in the hall . She hesitated , noticing for the first time in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hung about the house . Then she was moving down the hall , silently , with only the light rustle of her silk dress . ( I 'm still dressed , she thought . I forgot . The same dress I was wearing for dinner with Fred . And that was such a long time ago . A very , very long time ago . And Fred , now , I will miss him . ) She closed the front door behind her , and moved off down the street . Michael 's voice was echoing in her head : " If it had come out , honey bunch , I 'd be fired so fast I would n't even see the door slamming . " She found herself running , on tiptoe , silently , quickly.  |p234SHE  knew the house she wanted  --  a square box of yellowingstucco , set on a foot-high terrace . In the dark ( the entrance light was turned off ) she stumbled on the steps . She climbed them wearily , and it seemed that she would never get to the top , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door until she found the bell . She rang , timidly at first , then with more and more insistence . A light came on upstairs . A window opened and someone called : " Who is it ? " She did not answer . She stood under a little portico , hidden from sight . She kept ringing . While she waited , she fingered the scraggly tendrils of the Confederate jasmine that twisted around the entrance . A hall light . A clatter as the door unlocked . A not very friendly mutter : " What is this about ? " " Dean Lattimore ? " A grunted yes . " Would you mind asking me in ? " Joan said . " It'sp235quite cold out here and I seem to have forgotten my coat . " Afterward , looking back , and trying very hard , she found she could not remember parts of that morning . She could not remember going into the house . But she did remember being in a room , a living room that was half dark . There were only two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tidy . There were newspapers on the floor in a little heap , and butts in the ash trays . A couple of glasses still stood on the table , one with the froth marks of beer . It was all so familiar . As if she 'd been here before , saying the same things . As if it had all been done so long ago . She remembered being very quiet , very assured . She remembered smoothing out her skirt carefully before she sat down . She remembered crossing her ankles , properly . And she stepped out of herself . She stepped back , far back , and watched . It was like watching a movie screen . She was not involved at all . Sometimes she did n't even hear the words . Sometimes she could see her own lips moving and she knew that she was talking but she did not seem to hear the words . And then the sound would come back . . . . " A horrible time , I know . But if I did n't come now I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up for this . . . . "  |p236As  she went along she knew that she was not telling the truth , not the whole truth . That she was changing it slightly , very slightly . That she was deliberately destroyinga man . She knew it and it did not matter to her . She had no control any more . She did not feel vicious . She was not afraid . She did not feel anything at all . Except not part of herself any more . " He drove me across the lake . We were just going for a spin across the causeway , but we did n't stop once we got on the other side . . . . He brought beer out to the car and we drank can after can . . . . He told his class he was sick . . . . " Michael was so very handsome . White skin , dark eyes . Delicate face for a man . " I did n't believe it at first . ... " There was a cigar butt in the room somewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigars smelled terrible . Aurelie would never have left a cigar butt in her living room . .. . She saw herself lean back in her chair and rub her fingers against her temples . There was a question . She shook her head . " I 'm sorry , " she said , " I did n't hear you . " And who arranged this  --  this thing for you ? " She shrugged and lied deliberately . " He did . It was his . " She used to believe that the earth would open and swallow you if you told a lie ... . p 237There was a woman in the room , Joan noticed . A grey-haired woman in a dark red dressing gown . Deans were always married , of course . " He told me not to say anything , that it would ruin his career . " The dean snorted . " If this is true , young lady , it certainlyhas . " Joan stared at the windows . They had shades instead of Venetian blinds , and one of the shades was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she found herself saying , " you might wonder why I came now . . . . " They always liked to know the why of things . They always liked to have reasons . Neat and nice . She could give them a reason ; it would n't be true but it would be neat . " He 's started on my sister , my little sister . . . . " She heard a sharp breath from the dean 's wife . It does sound good , she thought . " Only tonight my mother had to ask him to leave the house . . . . " Aurelie , Aurelie , you 'll have to say that it 's true , because you wo n't dare not to . It 's still pitch black outside , because I can see our reflectionsas sharp as in a mirror . " If this is true . .. " " You can check . " Of course they could . There was just enough truth about it . They would find that out at once . And they would think that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words echoing around in her head : " I 'd be fired so fast ... . "  |p238Michael  , Michael where are you right now ? You do n't know what 's happened . And when you do it will be all over . . . . By then I wo n't be in love with you any more . I 'm almost not now . " I 'm going to leave , of course . I 'll have to leave . " And where would she go ? There had to be somewhere . It did n't seem to matter . Not that much . Shecould always go somewhere . She put her hands on her knees and pushed herselfupright . " Thank you for your time . " She was finished . She had done what she had to do . Now she could start to forget . The stand of pine and the soft needles . The early morning trip on the coast , with the bugs splattering on the windshield . It was ended now , the whole thing . " You 're not going to walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Now really . " " I have to walk . It 's the only way I can go . " " Where is your coat ? " " I left it at home . I forgot to take anything . " " You simply must have a sweater . I 'll get one in a second . " When she left it was with a sweater around her shoulders . A sweater that smelt foreign and strange and musty with old bureau drawers and perfume that had gone stale and harsh . When she stepped into the clear cold air she realized that that house too had the sweet sick odor of rats in it.  |p239Does  it get more intense at night or do we just not notice it during the day ? She walked on steadily . . . . Look once more , then start to forget . . . . Down the paths , among the trees , the trees that had no smell this cold night , the hotweathertrees . . . . Past the library , dark and closed ; and who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't really , way upstairs where no one ever went , only I did . . .. Along the brick walks , through the lines of azaleas , shoulder high , spotted with an occasional early flower . They liked the cold ; they would flame out in a month or so . And where did the couples go , the mating couples that huddled behind these azaleas on the hot nights of spring and summer and fall ? And where did they go ? I used to park my car over there , and I would walk this way . Before . A long time before . And I would see the little light on the gas dial glow up the inside of the car and I would close the door and be secure and safe inside my steel shell . She passed a watchman 's station . He was sitting in the tiny room , warming something on a little electric plate . He heard her heels and he came to the door and stood to watch her pass . " Good evening , " she said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he looked after her until she went around the line of bushes and was out of sight . She passed through the gates , the imitation Spanish gates that had the plaque of the class of 1905.  |p240I  came this way that morning and I saw him in the window and he came down and we went hunting for owls . Her heels clattered on the iron bridge over the deepestgutter . And it 's here that there was ice once . Years ago . Real ice that lasted a long time into the day , even after the sun came up . And that 's where the hibiscus bush is , the yellow one I used to pick every day last summer , every single day on the way to class . Only it 's frozendown now so there 're only some hollow brown stalks standing up ; it will have to grow back right from the roots when it gets warm again . The pavement was uneven now ; tree roots had thrown it up . She went more slowly , being careful of her footing . And then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'll own it some day , she thought , because I 'm the oldest and Aurelie will leave it to the oldest , whether she likes me or not . A tall narrow house , with an iron fence in front and a balcony across the second floor . There were no lights showing , only a glow deep inside . Maybe I can come back to it . And maybe I wo n't even want to . Maybe . But I 'll have to go away now . She stood directly in front of the gate and looked up at the house . I 'm standing right where that tramp stood . Right where he stood that day . Last summer . The day Michaelcalled for the first time . . . . And he stood out here and he must have been sick because he couldn'tp241seem to stay on his feet . And the police came for him . . . . She looked down the uneven pavement , smeared with grease by the falling camphor berries , rising in little chunks with the pressure of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fallen and lain there , muttering something . And there was n't anything left of it . . . . There was n't anything left of the child either , that had lived in the world and walked about and nobody had seen it and nobody knew it was there , listening . Ghost child . She had disturbed a mockingbird . Directly overhead he shifted and fluttered and sent down a half line of song , sleepily . I could stand anything , she thought , if it was n't so lonely . If I could get pregnant again , I would n't be so lonely . At least not for that time . There 'd be two everywhere I went then , for a while . In the center of the tiny yard the tile fountain gurgledgently . The bronze dolphins leered and squirted obscenely . It was the one mark her father had made on the house on Coliseum Street . Joan thought : Except for me . And I 'll have to go away now . Once they know what I 've done , I could n't stay in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a question of where . My father knew I would have to leave some day . And he fixed it so I can go . . . . And she bowed slightly to the crisp busy figure on the other side of the grave.  |p242She  opened the gate  --  the iron was icy cold under her hand  --  and went up to the door , the heavy door with its thick pane of cut crystal . The brass knob was colder than the iron . She turned and nothing happened . It was locked . Of course . It would have locked after her . She did not have a key . She had not thought to bring one with her . She stared for a bit at the knob that turned uselessly in her hand . Then she took one of the porch chairs and sat down in it and waited . It was quite cold in the early morning , and occasionally she shivered . Once she moved her chair to the spot the sun would strike first . Then she curled up , huddled inside her borrowedsweater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead-colored in the first light . The sun was beginning to come up.
