txt The United States termed unacceptable today the latest proposal by the European Economic Community for achieving tariff reductions in the major negotiations due to begin in May . United States officials let it be known for the first time that unless the community , or Common Market , softened its position , the United States might be forced to call off the talks . But the officials stressed that . they were " optimistic . " They said they believed that the Common Market would move from its present stand . At issue are the rules for ! cutting tariffs , which are crucial to the negotiations . The United States and practically all the other major trading nations in the West favor a cut of 50 per cent in virtually all tariffs , with a minimum of exceptions . Issue of Tariff Disparities The six-nation Common Market , led by France , has insisted that its own reduction should be much less than 50 per cent on a long list of items on which its duty is lower than the United States or British duty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cause of the current crisis in the negotiations . The talks have been labeled " the Kennedy round " because they are an outgrowth of the United States ' Trade Expansion Act of 1962 , passed by Congress at President Kennedy 's behest . While the negotiations have been on seemingly technical matters and have not yet captured much public attention , a failure could have grave political consequences . United States trade interests are directly at stake . So are those of the Western European nations outside the Common Market , to an even greater extent . The question shapes up as a // potentially major new clash between the United States and President de Gaulle of France . The issue of the tariff-cutting rules , on which the negotiations may succeed or fail . is supposed to be settled by May 4 , when the formal negotiations begin . United States officials were unusually blunt today on two points . First , they said that a new Common Market " compromise " formula on this issue , discussed in Geneva last week , was " substantially worse " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backward rather than a forward step . " Second , they contended that the Common Market 's insistence on what they termed " a disguised exceptions list " was just a device by which the Common Market could escape a 50 per cent cut on items involving trade " in the billions " of dollars . Well over a thousand items are involved . The United States negotiators , will return to Geneva later this month with counterproposals . These , according to officials , are aimed at " accepting as much of their proposal as possible " and " making suggestions that would be as easy as possible for them to accept . " Change Hard to Achieve However , with six countries involved and unanimous de-1 cisions required , a change in al Common Market position is al-1 ways extremely difficult tol achieve . France 's five partners ? West Germany , Belgium , the Netherlands , Luxembourg and , Italy  --  are , in varying degrees , in favor of moving toward th view of the United States , Britain and the other nations of Western Europe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corn mon Market proposal unacceptable , United States officials said , today that this country " would never go into a negotiation in which the benefits are not fully reciprocal . " They made plain their belief ) that a formula under which the Common Market would reduce ' hundreds of important duties by less than 50 per cent would not be reciprocal . The aim of the United States , it was said , will be to cut the number of items affected by the disparities formula and , even more important , to elimi-1 nate from the formula those ! items in which important trade flows are involved . The United States , batted by ! Britain and other Western ' European countries outside the Common Market , insists on a full 50 per cent on those items where the Common Market isl an actual or potential major importer . The original Common Market formula would identify as a dis- , parity ease all those items in which the duty of one country was 30 per cent or higher , as well as 10 percentage points above that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , almost always the , Common Market , would cut its ! duty by 25 per cent . The Cornmon Market acts as one country in regard to tariffs on other , nations ' goods . The new Common Market ! formula would identify as a disparity those cases where one country 's duty is double that of the other country , as well asi 10 percentage points higher. ! This , as it turns out , would of-1 feet more items , and more important items . Ironically , in the great ma- jority of disparities cases.1 where the United States has a high tariff , the United States is not an exporter of the product concerned and is not directly interested in how much the Common Market cuts its duty . Those mainly affected are Britain and other members of the European Free Trade Association , and Japan . At least 32 nations intend to participate in the negotiations . They include all the major non- . Communist trading nations .                   @ @
