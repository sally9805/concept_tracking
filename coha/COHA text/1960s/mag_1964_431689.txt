 | Our Only Native Stork , the Wood Ibis Q N WINGS THAT SPANNED a full five feet , the great birds flew in and out of the swamp , just clearing the treetops . Outward bound , they emerged with determined strokes from the gray cypresses , long necks and heavy bills pointing directly toward their goal ? a shallow pond a few miles away . Returning , they headed for their bulky nests in the tree crowns 40 and 50 feet above us . These were wood storks ? better known as wood ibises ? the only storks native to the United States . Chest-deep in swamp water , Fred Truslow and I peered up at the impressive birds , admiring their easy flight and filled with a sense of wonder at their obvious dedication and purpose . It was late spring , and the young birds were almost grown here at Bear Island Rookery in the Big Cypress country of southern Florida . Every wood stork in the area , male and female alike , was working at the serious business of feeding its young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't take pictures of these storks from down here , " he grumbled , shading his eyes with his hands as he peered skyward . " I 've got to get up in the air somehow . " I knew he meant what he said , for the indomitable Fred and I had teamed up before ? to study and photograph whooping  | cranes in Texas and spoonbills in Florida and Texas . This time our objective was another endangered species , one of North America 's largest waders . A striking and conspicuous bird , the wood ibis ( Mycteria americana ) has a scaly , bareskinned head , stiltlike legs , and brilliant white body plumage set off by greenish-black flight feathers . Its tail feathers are also black , with a purplish sheen ; in fact , it is the only North American wader with a black tail . It has an average height of 31/2 feet , a foot less than the whooping crane . The 18th-century naturalist Mark Catesbv called the bird a " wood pelican , " and " wood ibis " has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really a stork , not an ibis . Colloquial names ? often highly descriptive ? include ironhead , flinthead , gourdhead , preacher , and Spanish buzzard . Gannet , which is the correct name of an entirely different bird , is used in the Carolinas . Storks ' Decline Spurs Audubon Study During the breeding season , usually November through April , the wood storks , as I prefer to call them , converge on certain swampy areas in Florida to lay their eggs and rear their young ( map , following page ) . When the nesting season ends , the concentrations scatter throughout the southern states . Elsewhere these spectacular birds are found only in Mexico and Central and South America , but there are close relatives in Europe , Africa , and Asia . Our wood storks have had a rough time in recent years . Once , in Florida alone , there were well over 100,000 . By 1957 there were no more than 8,000 in the entire country . The wood stork 's future looked bleak indeed . Before that year was out , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Society ? studies that we hoped would  | give us the knowledge to help safeguard this threatened bird . Good photographs would be a valuable part of such a study . Back at camp , Fred and I talked things over with Peter Isleib , the Audubon warden guarding the rookery . Plainly , the only possible way to photograph these birds was from a tower . But how were we to build one without disturbing them ? possibly even causing them to abandon their nests ? " We will have to make the tower here , " Fred said , " then carry it into the swamp . " And that is just what we did . With lumber and nails from the nearby town of Immokalee we whacked together an 18-foot tower with a three-foot-square platform on top for Fred 's blind . Then Peter and another Audubon warden , Hank Bennett . helped us lug it into the swamp . From our camp we carried the monster three quarters of a mile to the Bear Island Rookery ? at times through water that reached our belts ? and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The platform loomed 14 feet above water level ( page 296 ) . Though the nests were still far above Fred 's head , two weeks of work on the shaky tower gave him the nesting pictures we wanted . Since then he his photographed hundreds of other wood storks ? from blinds , boats , and airplanes , as well as afoot , if " afoot " is the right term for standing knee-deep or worse in treacherous mud and water . At the pond where these Bear Island birds were gathering food for their insatiable young . we watched the long-legged fishermen at work . They were so absorbed in catching fish ? plus aquatic insects and an occasional small snake or frog ? that they paid not the slightest attention to us . Mickey Reveals an Enormous Appetite A wood stork needs a lot of food ? a f ; L I came to appreciate after an injured fern , was found floundering in the mud and water near the Bear Island colony . My family and fed her for a year and a half before turnir her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unused chicken per . and named her Mickey ? short for MycteriLi. the generic name . Greek for " snout , " it refers to the bird 's unique bill ? thick and heavy at the base , tapering to a decurved tip . At first Mickey was so weak and frightened that we had to resort to force feeding . But after a few days of quiet care she began to display an enormous appetite that kept the entire family busy . In fact , I soon discovered that Mickey 's  | tastes were too expensive for us . She disdained frozen shrimp , preferring live ones . But even in our area ? which is close to the source ? we had to pay a dollar for three dozen live shrimp . Mickey would dispose of the 36 in short order , then rummage in the water pan for more . Obviously , this could not continue . We finally persuaded our voracious guest that we might serve live shrimp as a special treat ? say on off Sundays and Izaak Walton 's birthday ? but that frozen mullet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fare . If the fish were small , Mickey would swallow them whole , headfirst , and a few inches at a time . But I had to split the large ones into sections . She took these readily enough if I tossed them into a pan of water with a hose running into one end ; this stirred things up and simulated the movement of live fish . Eats Nearly One-third Its Weight a Day Mickey weighed approximately six pound . and consumed nearly two pounds of fish dai i . A bird in the wild , living a more active lift-. would require an even larger amount ; and a male , slightly bigger than the female , ma. weigh 8 to 10 pounds or more . Plainly , preservation of large natural feeding areas is vital to the future of the wood stork . In past years storks were often killed for food , although never enough to reduce their population seriously . Alexander Sprunt IV , present Research Director for the National Audubon Society , tells a story that shows the high regard in which wood storks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South Carolina . On Wadmalaw Island , 11 miles south of Charleston , an inveterate old hunter named January appeared one day with a rusty shot-  | . gun in one hand and a dead stork in the other . " January , what in the world have you been doing ? " Sprunt asked . " Got me a gannet , suh , " said the old man . " What you going to do with it ? " " Gon na cawn it an ' eat it , suh ! " " Corn it ? How do you do that ? " " Well , suh , " said January , " yuh clean ' em , pick ' em , rub salt een ' em an ' out ' em , wrop ' em een a crocus sack an ' bury ' em een de groun ' . Dig ' em up ' bout a week fum Sunday , an ' ' e better'n a Christmas turkey , suh ! " Storks ' Chief Enemies : Man and Drought Until about ten or twelve years ago there seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stork , however edible . It was a common bird , with plenty of feeding grounds , except during drought , and after drought years the birds always seemed to build up their numbers again . Today the situation is more serious . Droughts still come . In addition , drainage and development projects have destroyed feeding grounds . Breeding sites have been ruined by lumbering and other clearing operations . I know of more than 30 nesting areas ? most of them in Florida ? that have been abandoned since 1900 . But we did not begin to feel real concern about the species until the early 1950 's , when a widespread drought began . By 1953 it had become severe ; in Florida there was no relief until September , 1956 . For the first time in ornithological history , wood storks in large numbers left their usual haunts and wandered across the United States as far north and west as New England and Wyoming , looking for enough water to provide food . Habitat failure was dispossessing the entire stork population . Abnormally low temperatures and winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few stork colonies . As a result , the country 's wood stork population sank to a critical low in 1957 . Then , just in time , the normal pattern of rainfall began to restore conditions on the feeding grounds . After many lean years , the storks started a definite upswing . In mid-January , 1959 , Fred Truslow and I visited Cuthbert Lake Rookery in Everglades National Park and found that 800 to 900 pairs of storks were well established on the is-303  | land in the middle of the lake ( pages 300-301 ) . Here , where the big trees have been swept away by hurricanes , the birds nest in young mangroves only about 10 feet high . All morning , as we inspected and photographed the colony from our boat , adult storks were flying in with nesting material . The nests were so low we could observe the family life of birds in detail . The newly hatched nestlings are grotesque , naked little creatures with strange dome-shaped skulls and yellow bills . At hatching the two or three young in each nest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this gives way to a white woolly coat . The first signs of flight feathers appear at three weeks , and the chicks hobble around on bent legs , stretching their stubby wings . At two months they are fully grown . In flight , wood storks are a sight to remember . There is power and dash in the way they take off , and the conspicuous black-and-white pattern is accentuated by the impressive breadth and spread of the wings . They are also expert gliders . Phil Kahl , or . of the Audubon research men , has well described their use of thermal air currents for transportation to and from their distant feeding grounds . The birds spiral slowly upwards in the rising column of warm air . At the " effective top , " where the pull of gravity and the push of the rising air on the birds are equal . they may be 1,000 to 2,500 feet above the ground . Here they set their wings for gliding . and off they go , without moving a feather . until they reach feeding ponds as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordinary flapping flight , Phil estimates that wood storks may do close to 35 miles per hour , top speed , which is very good for so heavy a bird . As we noted at Cuthbert , by 1959 the wood stork rookeries were finally shifting back into full gear , following the lean years of drought and severe winters . All previous records were broken in 1960. when there were 14 successful breeding colonies ? all in Florida . Alexander Sprunt 's con-@# 304  | servative figures showed an estimated 8,760 breeding pairs in Florida that year , more than half of them in the Corkscrew Swamp Sanctuary* ( map , page 298 ) . But early in September , 1960 , hurricane Donna ? one of the worst in a generation ? swept through Corkscrew Swamp . Luckily , most of the birds were scattered in small offseason flocks at the time , some of them still loitering as far away as Arkansas and South Carolina . Most of them , we decided , had probably been spared . Nest Building Hinges on Water Level Many of Corkscrew 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Columbus came to America , were uprooted or snapped like matches by winds as high as 160 miles an hour . But enough big trees survived to provide the towering nest sites preferred by the wood stork . As the 1961 nesting season approached , the big question was whether the birds would return and take up normal life in the trees left standing . Phil Kahl had a theory that the start of nest building is related to water levels on adjacent feeding grounds . Between 9 and 11 inches of water provides a great concentration of fish and also easy wading . At Corkscrew it had been near 11 inches when the birds began nesting in each of the three previous years ? twice in November , once in December . But now south Florida was deep under water , with serious flood problems caused by Donna . Would the nesting schedule be further upset by such conditions ? By December 1 the water had lowered . Storks were in the area , but there was no special activity . Two days later , Sprunt and Charles Hutchinson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gauge , they found the water level at 11 inches . " We 'd better go in and see what 's doing , " Sprunt suggested , half jokingly . They went deeper into the swamp , and be-@#  | fore ten minutes had passed they found rks coming and going in all directions . As Sprunt expressed it , they were " carrying on like crazy ! " They were also carrying sticks , raw material for building nests . With the rattle of bills sounding in their ears , the two delighted men retreated . The 61 nesting season was off to a good start . In March , 1961 , three months later , an estimated 6,000 pairs were busy raising a new generation of young at Corkscrew . The banner nesting season of 1960 was already being topped ! But our lordly stork lives in a delicate balance with nature . Our high hopes were dashed again the next year , when extreme drought struck . And , as far as we know , not one wood stork nest was built in Florida in the season of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corkscrew Sanctuary : Wood fires almost encircled it , and were moving in until a providential rainstorm on June 15 , 1962 , put them out . With near-normal rainfall thereafter , the birds renested , and by January 16. 1963 , the sanctuary held 3,000 nests . Disaster struck again last February , when a devastating storm killed some 60 percent of the young . But the storks renested and successfully raised at least 2,500 birds . Clearly the wood stork had made another comeback . There are now between 8,000 and 10,000 breeding pairs in Florida . Three Sanctuaries Hold Species ' Future As far as the United States is concerned . the fate of this magnificent wading bird is tied to Florida . We may never again see the vast assemblages of the past , but the vigor with which these birds have multiplied in recent years demonstrates an encouraging ability to recover . The present problem is to preserve a sufficient number of breeding sites and feeding areas . Only three of the regularly used breeding sites ? Corkscrew Swamp and two nesting colonies in Everglades National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All the others are on private property , and their future is not secure . The preservation of feeding grounds , such as Devil 's Garden , Okaloacoochee Slough , and portions of the Fakahatchee Strand , is also vital . The huge , unspoiled wilderness of the Florida of a century ago is gone forever . Still . many large areas remain reasonably intact . A few of these have already been preserved as monuments to the state 's natural beauty and exciting wildlife . The wood stork is a part of this heritage , and it will be well worthwhile to make special arrangements on its behalf . Once you have seen a flock o these great birds soaring against the brilliant blue of the warm winter sky , you will agree that our only stork should not be allowed to pass forever from the American scene . @#
