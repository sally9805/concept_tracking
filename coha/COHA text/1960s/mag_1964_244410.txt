Determined to defend her son 's name , Marguerite Oswald last week delivered a monologue before the Warren Commission in Washington . She carried with her a shoulder bag containing letters that Lee Harvey Oswald had written to her from the Soviet Union , as well as several undisclosed " documents . " Pre cisely what she told the commission was not made public , but it was evident that the patient investigators learned little that was new or pertinent . Mrs. Oswald , said Chief Justice Earl Warren , " produced nothing that would change the picture . " <P> A Positive Person . Away from the commission 's hearing room , she held court for reporters . " I can talk for hours , " she said . She insisted that Lee Oswald had been an agent for the Central Intelligence Agency , and that he " had been set up to take the blame " for the Kennedy assassination . He was the scapegoat , she said , mispronouncing it as " scrapgoat . " Frequently referring to him in the present tense , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CIA agent ? He is n't going to say he 's a CIA agent , and the Government is n't going to say he is . Lee , being an agent , would not say so to anyone . " If he was , he did n't tell CIA Chief John McCone , who hastily announced that Oswald had never worked for his outfit . <P> <P> Undaunted , Mrs. Oswald vowed to reporters that , " I 'm a positive person . You know , I have a philosophy . I have a deep sense of justice . I even think a Communist is a human being . Even if my son is a Marxist , he is a human being . Even Buddhists are human beings-Catholics , Jews and Negroes , or whatever our religion , we are all human beings . We live and breathe the same free air . I do n't think a name means anything . Just because you 're a high official , it does n't mean anything . It 's the man behind the name . Suppose you are a high official , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have wonderful views . " <P> " I 'm Indignant . " Mrs. Oswald is not very high on one official in particular-Lyndon Johnson . She was offended because the President did not invite her to the White House during her Washington visit . She was also miffed because Jackie Kennedy had neglected to send condolences when Lee Oswald was shot . " After all , " Mrs. Oswald said , " we loved Lee just as much as she loved her husband . We 're human beings , too . I 'm indignant at her , and I resent her thinking we 're not as good as she is . " <P> Marguerite Oswald claims that she has plenty more to tell , but she is saving it . " I have to have something left to write about , do n't I ? " she said to a reporter . " I ca n't tell you everything . " She plans to visit some New York publishers , hopes to get an advance of $25,000 or $50,000 for a book she intends to write . " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my book , " she muses . " No , I do n't want one . I believe I can write the book by just dictating. "
