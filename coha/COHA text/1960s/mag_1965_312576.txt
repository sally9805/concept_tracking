Venereal disease does not attract many medical researchers . There never have been great numbers of syphilologists , and their numbers and efforts have been sharply reduced since the 1945 discovery that penicillin is a fast and almost certain cure for early syphilis . But last week , as the most prominent U.S. syphilologists met in Denver for a VD seminar , it became clear that the cutback in research is premature . What is urgently needed is a vaccine against the disease . <P> The Contacts . Before a cure can be effected , the victims must be identified and their contacts traced . Of about $10 million appropriated by Congress for syphilis control , nine-tenths goes for finding cases and contacts and less than $1,000,000 for research into methods of prevention . <P> Baylor University 's Dr. John Knox is convinced that if as much money were put into syphilis research as went into research on polio - which did not kill or cripple as many people - a vaccine could be found in a few years . But the spirochete of human syphilis is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or in most animals . And syphilis research is under way at only four or five U.S. medical centers . <P> At the University of Michigan , Dr. Albert H. Wheeler is working with rabbits , but he lost federal support of his 1964-65 work because he did not seem to be getting results . <P> At the U.S. Public Health Service 's Communicable Disease Center outside Atlanta , Dr. Wilbur Deacon is working with monkeys . Next year , if Congress approves an appropriation of $175,000 covering his work , Dr. Deacon hopes to test human and other spirochetes in chimpanzees . These animals are expensive , but they will bring Dr. Deacon closer to man than any other syphilis vaccine researcher yet . <P> Untreated Million . Lest anyone doubt the severity of the syphilis problem , the PHS 's Dr. William J. Brown declared that it is , in fact , a raging epidemic , especially among teenagers , and most noticeable among recorded cases in city slums . His statistics : <P> &gt; Some 120,000 new cases each year in the U.S. ; up to 12,000 deaths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> &gt; No less than 25% of untreated cases end with syphilitic heart disease . <P> &gt; Among Americans under 20 , an estimated 650,000 venereal cases ( syphilis or gonorrhea ) each year .
