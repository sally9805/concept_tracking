 | I Remember " Papa " Hemingway I sAT IN MY room at the beautiful was in my mid-20s . As the new Hotel Nacional in Havana , articles editor of Cosmopolitan magbrooding about the fool 's errand azine I had been dispatched to Cuba that had brought me there . It was a to ask Ernest Hemingway to write a hot spring morning in 1948 and I piece on " The Future of Literature . "  | The more I thought about asking the world-renowned author to undertake such an assignment , the more ridiculous I felt . Finally , I took t he coward 's way out and wrote him a note . In it I explained the mission that had brought me there , and added that if he could simply send me a few words of refusal I would save face with my employers . Early the next morning the phone rang : " Dr. Hemingway here . Got your note . Ca n't let you abort your mission . You want to have a drink around five ? There 's a bar called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was seated at the bar when Hemingway arrived . He was wearing khaki pants , held up by an old leather belt with a huge buckle inscribed Gott Mit Uns ( God With Us ) , and a loose white-linen sport shirt . His hair was dark with gray highlights , and he had a heavy mustache . He was massive . Not so much in size ? although he stood over six feet and weighed more than 200 pounds ? as in impact . He was intense , electrokinetic , but in control ? a racehorse reined-in . He stopped to talk in fluent Spanish to one of the strolling musicians , and something about him hit me : enjoyment . How he 's enjoying himself , I thought . I had never seen anyone with such an aura of fun and well-being . And everyone in the place responded . " Hotchner , " he said , shaking hands , " welcome to the Cub Room . " Quail , Proust and Pilar . As we sipped daiquiris , he talked warmly about his farm outside Havana . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cool mornings with the only sound the crowing of the fighting cocks , and of quail coming to drink at the swimming pool before the sun came up . The hours passed unnoticed as we discussed films , Ted Williams , Lena Horne , Proust , television , swordfish recipes and Indians . The magazine assignment was never mentioned . He invited me fishing the next day aboard Pilar , his 4o-foot cabin cruiser . Not long after he guided the boat out past Morro Castle , we spotted the purple pectoral fins of marlin , and hooked one . " Cut your teeth on this , " he said , handing me the rod . My first reaction was panic . Here was one of the world 's great fishermen , a huge marlin and a complicated rod and reel ? and I knew nothing of fishing . But Hemingway was a superb teacher . In a quiet , patient voice he guided me every step of the way until I boated the beautiful big marlin . " We might just have a new firm ? Hotchner &; Hemingway , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had tentatively invited me into the select circle of his friends . After that exhilarating day , he abruptly announced that he would write the article I had been ashamed even to mention . He never  | did get around to writing it , but the visit to Havana evolved into something of far greater value : a lasting friendship which broadened my life immeasurably . For 13 years , ours was to be an invigorating , entertaining , uplifting , exhausting partnership . An Original Man . Ernest , or " Papa , " as his friends called him , was 49 when I met him . He had been married four times , been under fire in three wars and had restlessly roamed the world ? fishing for marlin in the Caribbean , hunting big game in Africa , following the bulls in Spain . He had incorporated these experiences into short stories and such novels as The Sun Also Rise. - and A Farewell to Arms , w tch had brought to American literature a new style of writing ? lyrically simple , direct , realistic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I found , two deep currents that ran simultaneously through Ernest 's tumultuous life : one was the urge to participate fully in and experience deeply the joys and sorrows of existence ; the other was the ability to assess these experiences and record them accurately on the printed page . Ernest was an original man . No one else 's word was good enough . He had to taste , smell , see , hear for himself . And what he saw and heard and experienced he wrote about in a way that made the reader feel himself a part of it . " All good books have one thing in common , " he once said . " After you 've read one of them you will feel that it all happened , happened to you , and that it belongs to you forever : the happiness and unhappiness , good and evil , ecstasy and sorrow . If you can give that to the reader , then you 're a writer . " Ernest asked me to adapt some of his work for television , a challenge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visiting the scenes of his youth and the settings of his stories . We shot birds at his ranch in Idaho , swam at his place in Key West , Fla. , played the races in Paris and fished for trout in Spain . With him I toured the windswept slopes of the Escorial where as a correspondent he had lived in caves with the Loyalist soldiers during the Spanish war , drove along the lovely French roads he had once cycled with Scott Fitzgerald , and walked through the Paris park where as a starving young writer he had caught pigeons for food . Ernest worked hard when he was writing , and when he was not writing he practiced the art of relaxation with equal dedication . He was never in too much of a hurry to savor the pleasures around him . He had been almost everywhere and had absorbed almost all there was to know about the places he had visited . His knowledge of local terrain , weather , customs , history , orchards , birds , wines , dishes , wild flowers , architecture and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ topics frequently and cheerfully . His intense interest in the passing countryside tended to make travel-  | ing with him slow , though pleasurable . A stretch which could be covered in one day 's normal driving would take us five . He liked to stop for leisurely picnics or to tarry at street fairs in little towns along the ay , mingling with people , testing is skill at the shooting booths , soaking up the impressions that would ter appear in his writing . Once at the races at Auteuil , the gemlike track in Paris 's Bois de Boulgone , Ernest stood raptly watching he people crowding to the betting Windows . " Listen to their heels on he wet pavement , " he said . " It 's all i beautiful in this misty light . Mr. egas could have painted it and gotten the light so that it would be uer on canvas than what we see . hat is what an artist must do . On canvas or on printed page he must capture the thing so truly that its Magnification will endure . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing was a side of Ernest the public never saw , was the most important aspect of is character . " You need the devoion to your work that a priest of od has for his , " he once said . Writng was an arduous ordeal for him , exhilarating , but demanding all of what he called his " juices . " When he had a book in progress , he was totally consumed by it , and at the end of each day he would count the number of words he had written and enter them carefully in a log . " I 've seen every sunrise of my life , " he told me . " I rise at first light , end I start by reading and editing everything I have written to the point where I left off . That way I go through a book several hundred times , honing it until it gets an edge like the bullfighter 's sword . I rewrote the ending of A Farewell to Arms 39 times in - manuscript and worked it over 30 times in proof , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summed up his feelings about writing in accepting the Nobel Prize . " For a true writer , " he said , " each book should be a new beginning , where he tries for something that is beyond attainment . He should always try for something that has never been done or that others have tried and failed . It is because we have had such great writers in the past that a writer is driven far out past where he can go , out to where no one can help him . " Grace Under Pressure . To go far past where one can go , to face eternity every day , to try for something that is beyond attainment ? these things require courage of the highest order . Ernest 's was that . ( He once described courage as " grace under pressure . " By that he meant all the pressures of existence : battle , writing , sickness , hard times . ) He seemed to court danger . As an 18-year-old Red Cross volunteer on the Italian front in World War I , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minenwerfer scored a direct hit on them , killing two of the Italians and mangling his own right leg . Badly wounded as he was , Ernest managed to hoist the Italian who was still alive onto his  | back and carry him across a field that was being raked by machinegun fire . The soldier was dead by the time he got him to safety , but for the exploit Ernest was awarded two of Italy 's highest medals . A surgeon later removed 28 pieces of metal from his leg . He had similar close calls in the Spanish Civil War . During World War II , he went to France as a war correspondent , but quickly abandoned that role for active combat . Artist John Groth recalls coming upon a French farmhouse being used by Ernest and the band of irregular troops he was leading . They were at dinner when German 88s opened up on them , spraying plaster and shattered glass all over the room . Everyone at the table made a dive for the potato cellar ? except Ernest . He continued calmly sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How can you just sit there ? " the amazed Groth asked . " Groth , " Ernest replied , " if you hit the deck every time you hear a pop , you 'll wind up with chronic indigestion . " The Courage of Conviction . But there was a different kind of courage that accounted for most of what Ernest did , believed in and respected in others ? the courage of conviction . I recall asking him once if I should follow my growing desire to quit my secure editorial job and try to make it on my own as a writer . " Well , it 's tough advice to give , " Ernest said . " Nobody knows what 's in him until he tries to pull it out . If there 's nothing or very little , the shock can kill a man . Those first years in Paris ? when I made my run , as you say you now want to make yours ? I quit my foreigncorrespondent job with the Toronto Star to put myself on the line . I suffered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to my room over the Montparnasse sawmill . There were times when I 'd sit at that old wooden table and read one of those cold , printed rejection slips that had been attached to a story I had loved and worked on very hard and believed in , and I could n't help crying . " The courage of his conviction that he was a writer , despite those rejection slips , carried Ernest through lean and difficult years to fame and the Pulitzer and Nobel prizes . But , for all his courageous exploits , and his formidable outward appearance , Ernest was a shy and a gentle man . His voice became strained and tense just talking on the telephone . He refused to speak publicly because of his intense shyness ; when he won the Nobel Prize for literature his graceful acceptance speech was read at Stockholm by the U.S. ambassador to Sweden . This shy , sensitive side of Ernest was seen only by his friends , toward whom he was boundlessly generous with his money , his possessions and his time ? which to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were a half-dozen old pals , down on their luck , who received regular remittances from Ernest . And he re- sponded with dispatch to any cry of emergency from any friend . Ernest had his own test of friendship . " The way to learn whether a person is trustworthy is to trust him , " he said . The Bell Tolls . I had always thought of Ernest as indestructible , but in 196o his health began to deteriorate . He had suffered innumerable injuries in his reckless desire to live life to the fullest , and they began to extract their toll . He became periodically moody and irrational , and was hospitalized at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester , Minn . It was there that I saw him last . I was shocked by his appearance . His once-burly figure had shrunk to 173 pounds , and his hair and beard were white . Yet he talked cheerfully of the good times we had had together . When it came time to go , he walked me to the elevator . " Good old Hotch , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't I , boy ? " " Through the best times I ever had , " I said . I was hurrying through a Madrid hotel lobby to catch a plane for Rome when a friend told me that Ernest had taken his life at his ranch in Idaho . I did not go to the funeral . I could not say good-by to Ernest in a public group . Instead , I went to a Catholic church in Rome ? his church , not mine . I found a deserted side altar , and sat there for a long while . When time came to go , all I could think of to say was , " Good luck , Papa . " I figured he knew how much I loved him , so there was no point in mentioning that . I lit a candle and put some money in the poor box and spent the rest of the night alone , wandering through Rome 's old streets . I thought of something that editor Ernest Walsh had written of Hemingway back in the ' 20s , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an obscure little Paris magazine . " His rewards will be rich , " Walsh said . " But thank God he will never be satisfied . He is of the elect . " I thought , too , of something Ernest had once written . " There are some things which can not be learned quickly , and time ? which is all we have ? must be paid heavily for their acquiring . They are the very simplest things , and because it takes a man 's life to know them , the little new that each man gets from life is very costly and the only heritage he has to leave . " Ernest left his heritage between the covers of a few books . We are all richer for his having paid so heavy a price to acquire those simple but new things which he bequeathed us. @#
