Marijuana ought to be legalized , argues a writer in Insight , published by students at Los Angeles ' Hamilton High . The " kill , kill , kill " spirit at North Hollywood High football games suggests a Nazi youth rally , claims the student-edited Participator . Such opinions are not precisely what most principals expect to see in their high school newspaper . In these cases , the authorities were in no position to object , since the articles appeared in off-campus publications . Catching the rebellious fervor of their college elders , high school students are turning out a rash of unsupervised and unauthorized " underground " newspapers to express what they claim are their real convictions . <P> No one knows how many such papers exist , since they appear sporadically , frequently flounder and die for lack of financial support or reader interest . Most of them are started by bright , active youngsters who are fed up with the blandness of official school papers . In Middletown , Conn. , for example , High School Senior John Beatman began editing the Omelette- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " - because students have " no outlet to express any controversy .

" When adults contend that sexy movies might " corrupt the minds of our youth , " they imply " either that the adults have corrupt minds already or that it 's O.K. to corrupt them . " <P> Obscenities &; Attacks . Unfettered by faculty advisers , a few underground papers sometimes contain childish obscenities and sophomoric attacks on school officials . Principals and teachers tend to deplore the underground journals , frequently ban them from school grounds or suspend the editors . Sometimes , however , the journalistic excellence of the papers wins out . In Needham , Mass. , for example , after students at the town 's high school founded the Razir , it quickly proved so worthy that officials let it circulate freely on campus .
