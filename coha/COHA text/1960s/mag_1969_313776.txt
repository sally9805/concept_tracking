In a rare award last week , a Parisian judge returned not only damages but the damaged property-a valuable piece of the plaintiff 's anatomy-to a French girl named Claudine Perot . During filming of the movie Secret Paris in 1964 , Claudine , who was then only 17 , allowed a tattoo artist to decorate her buttock with a full-color rendering of the Eiffel Tower . Under the contract , the tattoo belonged to the moviemaker-Ulysee Productions-which probably wanted it for publicity purposes . Accordingly , Claudine had it removed by surgery and gave it to Ulysee . This year , older and a little wiser , Claudine brought suit against the company . Ruling that the studio had taken advantage of a minor , the judge ordered Ulysee Productions to return the skin , to cut the scene from the movie , and to pay for plastic surgery to repair Claudine 's scar . He also awarded her $6,000 that should help soothe her wounded pride .                    @
