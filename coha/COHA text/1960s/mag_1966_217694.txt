In October , for the first time since early 1965 , the French failed to make their regular monthly conversion of $34 million into gold . Reason for the shift : rising imports of goods and outflows of capital are cutting into France 's once hefty balance of payments surplus . The country has few dollars to spare , and its bankers and businessmen want to hold onto them because they can earn higher interest rates on dollars than on French francs .
