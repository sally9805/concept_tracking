A high place along the banks of the Wabash . A young Negro has got a rope around his neck . The rope is held by a Man , whose Wife holds a very large revolver , pointed at the Negro . MAN ( Waves end of rope , and looks upward to an unseen branch of a tree . To the Wife ) Looked at you , did he ? WIFE Spoke to me . MAN Looked at you and spoke to you , both . We 've got all the rope we need . What we do n't have is a low branch . How did they used to get those ropes up over those high branches ? WIFE Threw ' em , I guess . MAN Looked at you and spoke to you while my back was turned . WIFE You were asleep . MAN Back turned and fast asleep , both . ( Makes a poor throw of the rope . ) Do n't tell me what he said . There 's a limit to what a husband has got to hear about a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , and probably a lot of other things too . WIFE A lot of what kind of other things ? MAN I 'm not saying he did any of them . What I 'm saying is he thought of doing them . He had them in mind . They were in the back of his head . What 's The Bible say ? p. 3 WIFE About what ? MAN A man looks at a woman , he 's done it . Now , that is n't me talking , that 's the Bible itself . That 's the word of God . The scriptures . A man looks at a woman , he has done it . John three sixteen . WIFE John who ? MAN Three sixteen . That 's the passage I quoted . WIFE It is ? MAN Give or take a word or two here and there . WIFE What about a woman looks at a man ? MAN John did n't say . What 's goose for the gander is gander for the goose , though , I guess . WIFE I 've never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not every day my wife  --  ( Shakes his head in disbelief ) This is n't going to be easy to explain to your mother . WIFE I do n't intend to explain it to her . MAN It is n't going to be easy for me to explain it to her . WIFE Why should you explain it to my mother ? Explain it to your mother . MAN A thing like this is always explained to the mother of the bride . p. 4 WIFE How long is the bride supposed to stay the bride ? Is n't a year long enough ? I expected to be a mother by the end of a year . MAN Has it been a year already ? WIFE It was a year eleven months ago . It 's almost two years now . MAN ( He means to ask if his wife is pregnant ) Are you saying you 're  --  WIFE I 'm saying I am not . MAN There is no need to conceal anything . If you are , just say so . I will put two and two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two together to that . MAN Oh . Now . Let me see if I can get this rope up over that branch up there . ( He makes another poor throw . To the Negro . ) Do you think you can throw this rope up over that branch up there ? NEGRO No , I do n't . MAN Maybe I can do it without the branch . Just stand firm while I pull on this rope . ( Man pulls at rope as Negro yanks his head and Man stumbles forward . ) Well , then , how are we going to do this ? NEGRO I do n't believe the knot you 've made around my neck would hold , anyway . p. 5 MAN What 's the matter with it ? NEGRO It 's loose . I 'd slip right out . MAN ( To wife ) Suppose he slips out ? What 's the law on that ? WIFE One try , and if the man gets away , you do n't get another try . MAN Let me hold the gun , then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how to tie a knot . MAN O.K. I 'll tighten the knot . ( He does so . To Negro ) That ought to hold , do n't you think ? NEGRO It 's too tight now . I can hardly breathe . MAN O.K. , loosen it , but just enough , not too much . ( Negro loosens the knot . ) Now , let 's get the rope up over that branch , shall we ? NEGRO What do you want me to do ? MAN Throw it . ( Negro throws the rope . ) You can throw better than that . Try it again , now . ( Again the rope is thrown . ) You 're not really trying . You 're not putting your heart into it . NEGRO I do n't believe anybody could throw the rope over that branch . p. 6 MAN Well , now , look , I want you to understand one thing . If you 're deliberately sabotaging the proceedings , you 're only making trouble for yourself . NEGRO Well , I certainly do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gun work ? WIFE It has for a hundred years . MAN Do n't speak directly to my wife . Ever . Do n't ever do that again . And do n't look at her , either . ( To Wife ) And do n't you ever speak directly to him again . And do n't look at him , either . WIFE I 've got to look at him if I 'm going to point the gun at him . MAN Keep your eyes half shut . WIFE Why ? MAN A woman looks at a man , she 's done it , too . WIFE Who says so ? MAN First Thessalonians three twenty-two . WIFE Well , First Thessalonians three twenty-two was n't thinking of me , because you ca n't hold a gun on a prisoner without looking at him . NEGRO Where did you get that old gun ? MAN Gettysburg . On our honeymoon . Two months ago . p. 7 WIFE Two years ago , not two months . I wish you 'd have a talk with your mother about that . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is . MAN Breakfast in bed , is n't it ? In another city ? WIFE I thought you did n't know . MAN Let me have the gun , while you climb up the tree and get this rope over that branch up there . You were always good at climbing . WIFE My answer to that is a loud clear no . MAN I 'm your husband . Please do n't forget that . WIFE O.K. MAN When a husband asks his wife to do something , she does it . ( Pause ) Second Thessalonians , three thirty-three . WIFE How about quoting a couple of decisions of the Supreme Court for a change ? MAN A good wife is a blessing . A bad wife is not a blessing . WIFE Is that a recent decision ? MAN That is another quote from the Good Book . WIFE Well , forget the Good Book for a minute , and let 's get this thing over with , or let 's forget it . p. 8 MAN And go home disgraced ? WIFE Well , a little disgraced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at you . He spoke to you . I ca n't go home with that on my conscience . NEGRO I think I 'm entitled to a fair trial . MAN You 're entitled to no such thing . NEGRO According to the Constitution , I am . MAN The Constitution has got nothing to do with it . This is a private matter . NEGRO I think I 'd rather not be dragged into it . MAN You should have thought of that when you spoke to my wife and looked at her , and all those other things . Now . Let 's get this straight once and for all . A job has got to be done . It is going to be done . NEGRO I did n't look straight at her . I looked kind of on the side , like this . MAN I was asleep , and you took advantage of me . You came to my wife like a snake in the grass . WIFE Is that from the Good Book , too ? MAN It most certainly is . Deuteronomy seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Guilty or not guilty ? p. 9 NEGRO Those are not the facts . MAN Guilty or not guilty ? NEGRO Of what ? MAN Your question is out of order , irrelevant , and immaterial . Guilty or not guilty ? NEGRO Not guilty . MAN That proves it . Only a guilty man would say not guilty . ( To Wife ) Are you sure all he did was look speak ? I 'm beginning to suspect other things . WIFE All he did was look and speak . MAN No need to conceal the truth , out of a sense of embarrassment , shame , and mortification . WIFE The truth is not being concealed . NEGRO If anything , it 's being over-exposed , enlarged , magnified , and distorted . MAN You 've been to school . That 's what comes of education for all . WIFE We came here for a picnic , and I 'm getting tired of not having it . I 'm hungry . I 'd like to sit down and eat the sandwiches and drink the soda pop . MAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly slept through the picnic time . Did you or did you not on the afternoon of Sunday September the twenty-first sleep through the picnic time ? p. 10 MAN You should have woke me up . You were alone with him for quite some time while I slept . ( To Wife ) You did n't tell me that . Why ? WIFE I was not alone with him for quite some time . I was never alone with him at all . You were here all the time , fast asleep . I do n't know about you but I 'm going to sit down and eat . ( She hands the Man the gun . ) MAN At a time like this ? WIFE Yes , at a time like this . I came here to have a picnic , and I 'm going to have it . MAN What about me ? WIFE You can have a picnic or not , as you please . MAN What about him ? WIFE Well , there 's enough for him , too . MAN I mean , what are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , opens basket , sets out stuff to eat . ) I do n't believe we have the makings here of some kind of wild hysterical orgy of righteousness with inept quotations from The Bible , so I suggest you find some other use for that rope . MAN Are you asking me to let him go ? p. 11 WIFE Is there something else you believe you can do ? The branch of the tree is too high , the knot around his neck is too loose . Even if the branch were not too high , you would never be able to lift him off his feet , so why do n't you just forget the whole thing and enjoy one of these sandwiches ? MAN Just because I happen to be able to control myself does n't mean I 'm not enraged . If I could get the rope over that branch , I could lift him off his feet all right . When a husband is enraged , he has the strength of six men . WIFE O.K. , I think I 've got enough sandwiches for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've got a job to do . WIFE Do it after the picnic . All six of you do it after the picnic . You 'll need the extra strength . MAN Who 's going to hold the gun ? WIFE Forget the gun . Tie the rope around the rock . MAN ( Does so . To Negro ) This is only a suspension of the event , a slight postponement . The case is not closed . Alabama versus Pettigrew , 1821 . NEGRO What 's that ? MAN In the year 1821 the state of Alabama permitted one Ellwood Pettigrew to attend his daughter 's graduation from high school , after which his trial was continued , he was found guilty , sentenced to life imprisonment , which displeased the citizens of Outer Montgomery , who broke into the jail , captured him , and I believe you can guess the rest . Face away from my wife while we have our picnic . p. 12 WIFE Hand him a sandwich . MAN That is permissible . Arkansas versus Boone . ( Hands Negro sandwich . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Peanut butter . NEGRO I do n't like Peanut butter . MAN What other kinds do we have ? WIFE Tuna fish , baloney , tomato , cucumber , cheese . NEGRO You got a cheese on rye ? WIFE Yes . MAN You are not to speak to him . That 's for me to do . WIFE O.K. , tell him yes , we 've got a cheese on rye . MAN Yes , we 've got a cheese on rye . NEGRO With mustard ? WIFE Tell him yes , with mustard . MAN Yes , with mustard . NEGRO I do n't want it . MAN Why not ? NEGRO I 'm entitled to a full course dinner , from soup to nuts , with all the trimmings . Sing Sing , Leavenworth , Alcatraz. p. 13 MAN Those were legal cases . NEGRO Legal or illegal , I want my last supper to be unforgettable . Caviar , champagne , lobster , sirloin steak , apple pie a la mode , brandy , cigar , bicarbonate of soda . MAN They did n't give that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much . NEGRO Then , this whole thing is a mockery of justice . MAN It is no such thing . If you refuse to eat the peanut butter or the ham on rye with mustard , that 's your look-out . I 'm having my picnic  --  uninterrupted . ( Wife sings , " Rock of Ages " ) Just stand faced away from my wife , that 's all . ( He chews a sandwich . ) Good . It 's nice out here by the river . A perfect place for a picnic , and an afternoon nap . ( He stretches out on his back . ) Man , look at those leaves up there . Must be thousand of them . They say every leaf is like a child to a tree . Exodus ten thirty-two . WIFE Here . Have another sandwich . ( She looks down at his face . ) Well , he 's asleep again . ( Pause . ) I said , he 's asleep again . NEGRO Are you speaking to me , Ma'am ? WIFE Well , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 14 NEGRO Yes , Ma'am . WIFE I think you better take that rope off and go along . NEGRO Yes , Ma'am . ( Does so . ) He wo n't come after me with that gun , will he ? WIFE No , I do n't think so . NEGRO I mean , I 've got a wife who 'd be awfully surprised about a thing like this . Not to mention three growing daughters . What did I do wrong ? WIFE When ? NEGRO Now . WIFE Oh , now , you did n't do anything wrong . NEGRO Did I do something wrong some other time ? WIFE Well , I do n't know whether you did it , or whether it was done to you . NEGRO I do n't remember anything like that . I 've always gotten along pretty well  --  until just a little while ago . What are you thinking of ? WIFE A little matter of color , of course . NEGRO I have never liked or disliked anybody on account of color . Although I am a little vain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind ? NEGRO On the contrary , I would n't think of being any other color . p. 15 WIFE You can turn around now . And I think you 'd better go along while he 's still asleep . NEGRO ( Turns ) Goodbye , then , and good luck . WIFE Goodbye . MAN ( Sits up suddenly , thrusts out revolver ) Oh , no you do n't . I heard every word both of you said . Now . Put that rope around your neck again . NEGRO Some other time perhaps . I 've got to go now . MAN Stop ! ( Negro walks away while the Man presses the trigger quickly three or four times . ) They do n't make these things the way they used to . Hand me another sandwich , will you ? ( He lies back . The Wife hands him a sandwich . He bites into it . ) It certainly is a nice day for a picnic . WIFE Quote some more from the Good Book . MAN What part ? WIFE Where it says about begatting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of names . WIFE But they were begat . MAN Sure they were begat . WIFE I always believed we might do some of that . p. 16 MAN Say a lot of names to each other ? John , Mary , Joseph , Esther ? Like that ? WIFE Yes , something like that . MAN O.K. , I said four , now you say four . WIFE Edward , Helen , George , Elizabeth . MAN Daniel , Rebecca , Arthur , Gertrude . WIFE Archibald , Margaret , Charles , Genevieve . MAN ( Sleepily ) Henry , Eleanor . It 's nice out here . WIFE But that 's only two names . ( Looks at him ) Oh , well . We 've got a good assortment of names , anyway . ( Sings Rock of Ages ) Negro comes back . NEGRO What I was going to ask before the trouble starter was could I buy that rope ? I 've got three kids who want to do some rope jumping . WIFE Oh , you do n't have to buy it . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes , dragging the rope behind him . Man and Woman watch the rope disappear .
