txt John J. Williams R. , Del. said today he was concerned by a I. report that President Johnson ! persuaded the National Associa ; lion of Broadcasters to pay LeRoy Collins $60,000 in severance pay , Collins was president of the association and resigned to accept appointment as director of the conciliation service established by the civil rights act at $22,500 a year . Williams told the Senate that the trade magazine Broadcasting said that because Collins resigned from his $75,000 a year job the N. A. B. was under no obligation to pay him severance , " but settlement was negotiated after personal intervention of President Johnson , who called members of the executive committee of Ethel N. A. B. board to his office to request Mr. Collins ' release , " Vote Ills Release The magazine said it was in response to Johnson 's assurance that Collins ' services were needed that the executive com mittee voted to release Collins " and give him severance to offset the salary sacrifice he will make in taking fa government job . " " I question the propriety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future is so dependent upon decisions of regulatory bodies and confronting them with a demand that they underwrite or compensate this official for his loss in income as a result of taking a government job , " Williams said . Under this formula , Williams asked , what would stop the Ford Motor company from . underwriting Secretary of Defense Robert S. 's government service to offset the difference in his salary as president of Ford , or General Motors from having underwritten the salary of the late Charles E. Wilson when he was secretary of defense . Feels It 's Overlooked " I am sure that President Johnson would have been the first to criticize either of these procedures , and I can not but feel that he has overlooked the significance of this precedent wherein he personally is encouraging private industry to supplement the salary of a public official , " the senator said . Williams said there can not be a dual standard for government service and the fact that the President negotiated ' such pay- ' ments does not minimize the danger because , " certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommendation of the President . " The senator said he respects Collins and will support his confirmation when it comes before the Senate .
