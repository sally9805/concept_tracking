txt James Wise could n't accept the fact that Nancy , his common-law wife , had found another man . When he caught them together one day last year he drew his pistol . Ralph Hill , the rival , ran for his car , but Wise fired four shots into the middle of his back . Wise walked over to the fallen man , shot him a fifth time , and flicked his cigaret into the pool of blood next to Mr. Hill . The charge was murder . But a jury found Wise guilty on the lesser charge of " murder without malice , " and he now is serving a maximum five-year jail term that could allow parole within one year and seven months . Such light punishments for homicide are common in Texas . Wise 's defense centered on the other man 's efforts to steal the affections of his wife . Tom Curtis , the district attorney in this west Texas community , says the jury was sympathetic to this line of reasoning . " You ca n't change the basic facts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shooting another over a woman . " Free and Easy The permissive attitude towards some kinds of violence that characterized the Texas of frontier days lives on in this state . Gun laws are fairly strict by comparison with other states , but enforcement is lax and sporadic . The prevailing mood of the public discourages prosecutors from seeking long jail terms for homicides that seem to involve self-defense or defense of one 's honor . " Murder in Texas often involves the frontier type of spirit in which a person has a right to kill under certain circumstances , whether or not there 's a legal defense , " says Henry Wade , Dallas district attorney . " People believe that if a man calls you a liar you have a right to kill him . " Texas has a special and perhaps undeserved notoriety stemming from the assassination of President Kennedy in Dallas and the killing spree of Charles Whitman , the student who slew 14 passersby and wounded 31 others from a University of Texas tower in Austin in 1966 . But , observers say , the situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national debate over law and order . Concern about continuing violence tends to focus on the riot-prone cities of the North . But violence by gun  --  and less frequently , knife  --  takes a proportionately greater toll of life in Texas and some other Southern states than it does in the North . Tallying Up Number Two Texas last year was the number two American state in murders , with 1,159 killings . New York state , the leader with 1,181 , has almost double the population of the Lone Star state . Texas recorded 10.6 slayings for each 100,000 inhabitants last year , far above the national average of 6.8 per 100,000 , and more than all but four other states  --  Georgia , South Carolina , Florida and Alabama . As in the North , most of Texas ' killings take place in the cities . Houston led the state in 1968 with 273 murders , according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation . In the number of murders per 100,000 inhabitants , Fort Worth was third nationally , behind Atlanta and Texarkana , which straddles Texas and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was 10 above the national average . The Dallas Times Herald publishes a periodic murder tally on its front page , keeping readers posted on the count for the city . The 1969 tally stood at 213 in the most recent tabulation . Interns at the emergency room of Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas  --  where 706 persons were treated for gunshot wounds in the first seven months of 1969 ? call their facility " the Dallas knife and gun society . " A number of observers subscribe to the theory that the apparent readiness of Texans to settle disputes with weapons reflects the frontier heritage . Percy Foreman , the colorful and successful criminal attorney from Houston , says : " There was a time , not far distant in the history of Texas , when every man was a law unto himself . The Colt .45 was the law of the West , and your ability to use it determined how much law you were able to enjoy . " Facing Down Rattlesnakes There still are hardships of the frontier variety in many parts of Texas that make guns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Safety says , " There are certain sparsely populated areas in west Texas where there might not be 100 people to 200 square miles . When a man gets away from the ranch and his truck breaks down  --  well , you 've got rattlesnakes . You 've got everything elle out there . It 's a matter of preservation . " Texas has a fairly strict pistol law that , with minor exceptions , prohibits all but peace officers from carrying sidearms . Violations are punishable by up to a year in jail and a $500 fine . However , Texans are allowed to keep sidearms in their homes . The pistol law , in practice , simply is n't enforced strictly . Citizens often carry pistols in their automobiles . Women frequently pack pistols in their purses . Rifles and shotguns , on which there are no restrictions , often are carried in special racks in pickup trucks .. The new Federal law that bans interstate sale of guns by mail has n't had any discernible effect here , law enforcement people say . Lawyers assert that there never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enact really stringent gun-control legislation . Mr. Curtis , the district attorney here in Amarillo , says , that " basically the Texas pistol law is a good - law , " but he deplores lax enforcement , which he blames for much needless violence . " Pistols can turn an ordinary fistfight into a murder situation , " he says . The district attorney believes that the tolerance of gun law violations extends into the jury box . " It 's difficult to get juries to convict a person under the law unless there are aggravated circumstances involved , " he says . Many observers trace much of the violence here to the state 's homicide laws . A legislative committee is studying the laws with a mind to possible revisions , but the laws have n't been changed essentially since they were enacted in 1856 . The permissible grounds for shooting to kill are broader in Texas than in most other states . For instance , a man does n't have to retreat before killing in self-defense , a requirement in the penal codes of most states . Texas law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theft by night . " Under Texas law , if it 's at night and property is involved , you can pretty much shoot with impunity , " says Seth S. Searcy III , a lawyer involved in the project to revise the state 's penal code . George Wilfred Stumberg , late professor of law at the University of Texas , penned a thought that lawyers say still applies in Texas : " One may kill not merely to protect one 's bodily safety , but also to maintain possession of property of even only slight value or to protect a privilege which could ordinarily be given up momentarily with only little , if any , loss of face . " Texas is one of a handful . of states that still have a paramour law . Such statutes allow a husband to kill his wife 's lover if he catches the two in the act of sexual intercourse . In 1965 , one state legislator introduced an " equal shooting rights bill " that would have extended to wives the same privilege . The bill was defeated . Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyers say that juries often invoke its spirit to be lenient in homicides involving love triangles . " Any time you have one man shooting another man over a woman ? I do n't care too much what the rest of the circumstances are ? it 's rare to get anything more than a conviction of murder without malice , " says Mr. Curtis . Until two years ago , there was some effort to keep track of gun sales in Texas . A state law required dealers to send carbons of their sales slips to a state agency . But Fred R. Rymer , supervisor of the firearms section of the Department of Public Safety , says : " As best we could figure , only about 13% of the dealers were reporting each year . We just did n't have the personnel to handle it . So we just disregarded the statute and told the ( state ) attorney general we could n't fool with it any more . " The statute was amended to drop the reporting requirement . Dealers still are required to keep their records for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to authorities on request , however . Since there is no gun licensing law in Texas , authorities have difficulty estimating the number of guns in circulation . A spokesman at the Department of Public Safety estimates that between 150,000 and 200,000 are sold legitimately each year . C. B. Wiley , owner of a medium-sized gun shop in Dallas , says he sells about 300 guns a month , mostly to persons aged 50 to 60 . , The gun business is proving so profitable that Mr. Wiley has given up an appliance center that he used to run on the side . However , one of his competitors has n't been so fortunate ; despite a catchy name , Ketchum &; Killum Sporting Goods went out of business .
