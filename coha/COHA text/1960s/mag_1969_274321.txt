THE RISE AND FALL OF THE MAN OF LETTERS by John Gross . 322 pages . Macmillan . $8.95 . <P> " Pigsbrook " was the way Victorian Critic F. J. Furnivall referred to Algernon Charles Swinburne . The poet wrote of Furnivall as " Brothelsdyke . " Vituperation , however , has gone out of style in literary controversy , and it is the thesis of British Critic John Gross that this is a pity . If men do n't lose their tempers over literature ( as once they did over theology ) , it means that literature does n't matter much any more . <P> Gross has had the excellent idea of passing in review a long file of " men of letters " from Francis Jeffrey and Thomas Carlyle to T. S. Eliot and F. R. Leavis who agreed on nothing but shared a belief that their literary squabbles were deadly serious engagements in a battle for the keys to the kingdom of the mind . Scientists , today 's high priests , may regard their theories as the most important thing on earth ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . But once Carlyle could say , and be believed , that the man of letters is " our most important modern person . " Since then , something has happened to reduce the bookman to a mere bookworm . The man of letters , according to Evelyn Waugh , belongs to an extinct species-like maiden aunts . <P> Literary Thunderheads . For Gross 's purposes , " men of letters " are critics and journalists-as distinguished from novelists , poets , playwrights and other creative persons , though countless creators served as men of letters too . His well-read line of English literary men should really be traced back to Dr. Samuel Johnson , whose Lives of the Poets began the great industry of literary criticism and gossip . But what began with a bang ( Johnson was capable of no lesser noise ) is clearly ending in a whisper . Between Johnson and Eliot lay the great age of the literary thunderheads , roughly dated between the end of the Napoleonic Wars and the onset of World War I. Then boomed and flashed the resounding literary quarterlies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carlyle , Walter Bagehot and Arnold . Such cloud-capped , towering judges of culture and anarchy have dissolved in today 's bland intellectual climate . But in their heyday , English men of letters could claim , in Gross 's phrase , to have " written a collective biography of the national mind . "
