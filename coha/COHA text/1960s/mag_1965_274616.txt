Even more than the automakers , whose 1966 sales are off to a roaring start , U.S. truck manufacturers thrive on good times . As the economy grows , demand for trucks to haul everything from flowers to forge castings grows even faster . In 1965 , for the fourth consecutive year , the U.S. 's 14 truck manufacturers expect to shatter records by turning out 1,500,000 vehicles and running up a 10% sales increase . Last week International Harvester , the industry 's third largest company , announced that its truck sales have surpassed $1 billion for the first time , thus making Harvester the first company outside the passenger-car field to exceed that mark . Most truck companies are running as much as four months behind on deliveries . <P> No Harm from Piggybacking . With 37% of the truck market , Chevrolet easily leads other truckmakers in sales , is followed by Ford and Harvester . The two hottest sellers are the Mutt and Jeff of the industry : the small delivery truck and the huge tractor-trailer . Chevrolet 's 61 models have cornered 78% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now accounts for 76% of all truck sales . The light trucks have even inspired some leisure-time cousins : small , rugged vehicles that are designed for camping , recreation and family hauling . To satisfy this market , Chevrolet has introduced the Chevelle El Camino , Ford has brought out a Ranchero on a Falcon chassis and a rugged , all-purpose Bronco roadster . Harvester is pushing its Scout , and Kaiser has a strong-selling civilian model of the Jeep . <P> The market is equally strong in the big-truck field-dominated by Harvester , White Truck and Mack-in which volume is lower but individual price tags vastly higher . Most orders come from interstate freight lines and are for huge tractor-trailers . Railroad piggybacking has not harmed this market as truck makers feared it would . Railroads still need trucks to haul trailers off freight cars and on to destinations ; besides , trucks are still the most economical carriers for runs under 500 miles . <P> The heavy-truck companies are developing increasingly sophisticated new equipment . Chevrolet showed off a turbine engine last week at the Manhattan convention of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of turbines may delay their widespread introduction for some time . Trucks are now equipped with air conditioning , pushbutton windows , transistor radios , bucket seats and adjustable steering wheels . Most big trucks carry beds with innerspring mattresses for the alternate driver ; companies are planning to add bathrooms , pantries and even TV before long . <P> No Kicking Tires . Unlike the auto industry , in which buyers crowd into showrooms to kick tires and slam doors , the truckmakers rely on aggressive bell-ringing salesmanship . The fleet owners , the largest of which are A.T . &; T. , Hertz and REA Express , account for 30% of all sales . They care less about chrome than about axle ratios and operating costs , unlike auto buyers insist on vehicles that will easily run 400,000 miles without major overhaul . All the salesmen 's calls and painstaking demonstrations for show-me truckers are worth the effort , however . Depending on optional equipment , truck sales run as high as $130,000 per vehicle , with commissions to match .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
