Among the world 's fledgling nations , the U.S. has had no better friends than Tunisia and its anti-Communist President Habib Bourguiba . But as the U.S. pondered for two years whether to build a sorely needed dam in Tunisia , Tunisians grumbled that neutralist nations were getting plenty of money . <P> Few areas in the world could profit more from water than Tunisia 's Sahel region , where some 4,000 farmers scratch out a living . But U.S. Development Loan Fund technicians argued that there was not enough water in the Nebana River to warrant building a dam . " It might be no more than a beautiful white elephant , " said an observer . <P> Tunisians insisted that there was enough water underground which could be tapped by wells to supplement the river supply . DLF officials mulled it over . Finally , when President Eisenhower paid his brief visit to Tunisia last December , Bourguiba told him that a Soviet trade mission had suggested that Russia would be only too willing to help build the dam if the U.S. did not . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported tnat the Tunisians were right : there was enough underground water . Last week DLF announced that it would lend Tunisia $18 million , enough to assure the building of the dam and the drilling of 15 ground wells . <P> The dam , to be completed in 1965 , will irrigate 11,000 acres , is expected to yield an extra $4,000,000 worth of crops each year . Above all , it promises to help insure social stability in a land whose poverty works against stability .
