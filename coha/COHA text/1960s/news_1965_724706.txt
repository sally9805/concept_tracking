txt Washington Quietly , behind the scenes , one of the best political technicians in the country is trying to put a national party together again . Unassuming Ray C. Bliss of Ohio , newly installed chairman of the Republican National Committee , is generally agreed to have one of the toughest jobs in the country . On the other hand his past record inspires confidence . Mr. Bliss sees himself as a technician , not an ideologist . He is leaving the doctrines to the elected spokesmen . His job , as he sees it , is to unify the party , to get the type of candidates who will be elected , and to put GOP doctrines into effect . He must try to do that  --  and raise the money , too . Staff takes shape Mr. Bliss 's skill at organization is legendary . It was spectaCularly illustrated in 1960 . Under his direction Ohio was about the only big industrial state that went for Richard M. Nixon , and it did so by a thumping majority . California slid into the Nixon lineup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bliss has rolled up his sleeves . He is bringing his Ohio methods  --  and some of his Ohio team  --  to Washington . He took office formally April 1 . Mr. Bliss is a short man with a round face and a droll smile . It is very hard to dislike him . He also is hard driving , intense , and a perfectionist . With a minimum of fanfare he is building up an organization that has the same dedication to work that he does . Unanimous choice There is a vast amount of work to do . Barry Goldwater got 7,000,000 votes less than Mr. Nixon four years before , saw the percentage of the Negro vote drop from 32 percent to 6 percent , and read opinion polls that said only 25 percent of the voters consider themselves Republicans while 52 percent are Democrats . These figures are from a professional survey taken for the Republican National Committee . Riven by dissension , diminishing in popularity , lacking an acknowledged leader , overwhelmed in Congress , and stunned by the worst election defeat of modern times , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Bliss is goh.g to try . Everybody who knows him thinks it is something to watch . Some think that if the Whig Party had had somebody like Mr. Bliss it would not have disappeared a century ago . Mr. Bliss has one great advantage . He is the almost unanimous choice of his party for his " relief " job . Mr. Goldwater backed him , and so did the anti-Goldwater Republican governors . Peterson heads research The GOP does n't have much money , but that probably is n't Mr. Bliss 's worst problem . The basic problem is fragmentation ; the tendency of a deeply divided party to run off in all directions . Mr. Bliss 's unifying tool is the new Republican coordinating committee , composed of congressional leaders , governors , and national figures . Mr. Bliss has brought in Dr. Arthur Peterson of Ohio Wesleyan University to head the national research staff , plus two assistants . He is slowly and carefully filling out his team . It costs about $1.5 million a year to run the national committee , let alone carry on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the till , but that problem does n't seem to worry him . Unite the party and the funds will come , he believes . Scranton urges opposition - role for GOP : Page 6.
