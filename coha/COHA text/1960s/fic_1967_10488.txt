okay . But business is still business . And this one is going down the drain . " Is the company that badly off ? Diddy had n't noticed . Nor ever imagined Jim to be so disaffected . The question is , can anything be done about it . " Honestly , " Jim went on , " I do n't think Watkins or Reager has any idea what the company is up against . When they see sales drop off , they always assume there 's something guys like you and me can do , like selling louder , to make the figures go up again .

They came over to the table and joined Diddy and Jim for coffee . Diddy excused himself for a minute . Hurried upstairs to get his briefcase . At nine fortyfive , all four men were in front of the Rushland , where a black limousine driven by an elderly Oriental wearing a dark blue uniformwaited for us . The front door on the driver 's side has a small dome-shaped insignia , painted blue and gold . Otherwise , all black . Like a hearse , Diddy thought . But it did n't bother him.  | " What 's your name , son ? " said Jim , putting his hand on the chauffeur 's shoulder . " Chang , " said the man . Jim winked at the others , then settled back in his seat . Diddy claimed the jump seat . Not altogether comfortable . Becauseof an ache in his spine , it took time to search out the good position . Turning sideways , to face the rear door of the limousine . He could n't cross his long legs . But because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt himself to be under a different dispensation than the others . Exempted from tacking on to those indigestible strips of words being exchanged by the three men seated in a row to his left more strips of words ; his words , which were bound to be sticky as taffy or tough like overchewed bubble gum . Allen , Katz , and What's-his-name , sitting side by side , sunk deep in the gray felt upholstery . Jim not perceptibly different from and no more human than the rest of the trio ; and Diddy no fonder of him than of the others . Nothing remained . Mr. Dalton Harronin the jump seat maintains , always has maintained , exacting standards for personal relations , though life has promised him nothing . Knows that idle conversation of one with three can not be , fully , the word- and paper-clogged plenum of business , unswallowablebut at least necessary or anyway justifiable . But is already too many for real talk . One with three is a middle condition , serving nobody . The number precludes genuine nourishment , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only one other . On time . We left the city by the northwest . In a few minutes the car had cleared the disheveled downtown area , the streets scarred with trolley tracks and bloated with traffic ; the views disfigured by clashing buildings and punctured with construction sites . Monday has bloomed into a sunny soft late October morning . ( Now ) we were cruising along the expensive smooth asphalt of quiet residential streets ; no irregularities in the surface or unreasonablegaps in the views . Streets lined with long sloping lawns and widely spaced houses sixty to eighty years old , all well cared for and in pretty much the same pleasing style , but whose original symmetry had been violated with the addition to each house of a garage in which two cars were tucked away.  | " Here 's where the local Four Hundred hold the fort , " sneered Katz . " Wonder where the local Chinatown is , " said Jim in a stage whisper . Diddy , rendered almost nerveless by contradictory feelings , does n't mind Jim 's abrasive coarseness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whom he made a point of having little to do with in the New York office . By sneering , Katz exposed himself , made himself understandable . But why did Katz move about restlessly in his third of the comfortable seat ? Could all that fidgeting be provoked by the spectacle of such commonplace , modest luxury ? Katz probably grew up in a Bronx slum apartment with nowhere to play except P. S. Number Something 's cement recreation yard , shut in by a high Cyclone fence . Or on the sidewalk of his dingy block where he 'd had to worry about the ball shattering a window , calling down the curses of screaming tenement housewives , among them his own mother . Do n't be too hard on the envious . Be glad you have , or had in the past , something enviable . Diddy will be generous . He had been lucky , sheltered . Enough space , green space , in which to play . For Diddy had grown up in just such a spacious house , entrammeled with ivy , as those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mild tree-lined street , and in a smallish city not unlike this one . Before the war . Before all such prosperous old neighborhoods concealed , beneath their complacent regard , an anxious insecure look which came from learning what was to be their eventual destiny : demolition . And faceless apartment buildingsand housing projects , filing cabinets for living away one 's life , put up in their stead . But maybe they would n't be torn down . To Diddy today the bastions of the small-city bourgeois family looked virtually impregnable . The car glided along the wide , sparsely traveled asphalt that separated the facing houses . Houses that are quiet ( now ) , emptied of father-breadwinner and school-age children . Being cared for and stocked with provisions by mother-wife and her domestics . It was five minutes to ten . In two hours , the children would rush , trudge , and dawdle home . Someone like Mary would have the table set and lunch ready . Some of the fathers probably came home , too.  | " Mind if I open the window , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Diddy was accepting the ride , able to gaze out of the car window at the complacent houses and the livid red and brown foliage of autumn 's trees . He did not refuse these houses . How could he ? That would be to refuse himself . Nor did Diddy feel ironic about their inhabitants . The businessman and the businessman 's wife . The lawyer and his wife . The minister and his wife . The doctor , who was like his father , and the doctor 's wife , who was like his mother . The principalof the local high school , like Uncle John , and his wife , like Aunt Alice . Nor did he , even in imagination , condescend to their pampered well-fed children ; equipped with shiny English bicycles that moved on thin hard tires , tended by garrulous devoted Irish nursemaids , packed off for their weekly piano lessons . Why should Diddy mock himself ? We paused at a railroad junction , then crossed over with a rude bump into the less prosperous belt of two- and three-story frame houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lots , and warehouses that girded the edge of the city . The surface of the streets became rutted and uneven ; all the available curb space for parking was occupied . Diddy catches a glimpse of blue and gold profile , which vanishes after a moment . No vistas here . Besidescars , the street was crowded with slow-moving trucks ; some , double parked in order to make deliveries , nearly blocked our passage through the street . The black limousine moves slower ( now ) , but there 's less for Diddy to look at . The long low-lying factory was just ahead . Jim gave a mock groan . " Here we go ! Ready or not . " The car went through the gate ; without needing to stop , or anyway not stopping , to be cleared by the guard , who stands still as an effigy in his tiny booth . We go by too fast for Diddy to see his face . But time enough to notice that he wore a uniform different from our chauffeur 's . Wrinkled , less smart . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Rushland on his last trip worn a tan uniform similar to the guard 's , rather than the navy blue worn by today 's chauffeur ? Diddy would concedethat about this his memory might be mistaken . But he 's positivethe other chauffeur was n't an Oriental.  |p75U|p  the long landscaped driveway . We halted before the main door of the plant . No farther to go . " Thanks , Chang , " said Jim , still insisting on finding a joke in the man 's name or simply in his own effort to be familiar with him . No jokes for Diddy . There are n't many Orientals who drive hearses , are there ? But the man would be good at that job , too . An alert careful driver . One could n't imagine him running anyone over ; or even , through no fault of his own , being involved in an accident . And stepped out of the limousine . Before a building that had not been a harmonious whole for three decades . Once there was one structure built of brick . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by high , narrow , deeply recessed windows with heavy wood frames . And surmounted by a sloping , gray-slate roof . In the late 1940 's , two long wings or annexes were added , over whose basic building material , reinforced concrete , a thin skin of stucco had been applied ; and on that a relentless decoration of crescent lines had been incised . The stucco once white ; a stained , coarse offwhite(now) , the color of a vanilla ice deified by mud and urine . Three stories . A thin continuous belt of window glass on each floor . Flat-roofed . Diddy winced . The original edifice had been enclosed by two huge parentheses of ugliness . The building spoiled . But perhaps not entirely . All depends on the viewer . To see beauty under most circumstances , one had to look discreetly . Was n't it like that always ? Narrowing the aperture of vision , bestowing the fraction of a look . The better to discriminate between beauty and ugliness , life and death . Diddy could narrow his look and see just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example of Victorian factory architecture , where the firm 's offices , laboratories , and demonstrationrooms were located ( now ) . The factory proper having been moved into the wings . The ugliest construction of all , a building dating from the 1950 's which served as warehouse and shipping office , is located in the rear and mercifully hidden from Diddy 's present view.  |p76Jim  was greeting some men who were getting out of the limousinewhich had pulled up behind us . Diddy standing apart . Waitingfor Jim , looking up . And not simply at the cloudless azure sky . The blue and gold dome which topped the old brick structure had been the founder 's pet idea . After the architect brought from Boston had drawn up his plans , Amos Watkins ( 1834  --  1909 ) had insisted on his redoingthem in order to work in a chapel . At noon and in the late afternoon , all factory employees from the lowliestjanitor to the heads of the firm were convoked for prayer meetings . His son Hubert ( d. 1931 ) had dismantled the chapel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pews and the altar , but leaving the stained-glass windows depicting an allegory of the Triumph of Industry , Amos ' son installed desks and files and personnel , mostly women , of the expanding firm 's bookkeeping department . In 1928 , someone convinced Hubert that the huge vaulted space could be used still more wisely . Bookkeepingcleared out , the main laboratory of the company'sdepartment of research and technological developmentmoved in . But the dome remained , forever hinting at , while quite properly lacking , a cross . Presidingover the chapel that ( now ) no longer existed . The present Watkins , Hubert 's son ( 1914  --  ) , knew only the laboratory . His grandfather 's chapel was a quaint ancestral folly . Not real at all . The old flooring still exposed in the narrow aisles , between the squarish bulky machines and the long worktables of the technicians , was worn quite smooth ; holes made by the bolts that fastened down the pews had long been filled in . The stained-glass windows were taped on the inside and then covered by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reliable , uniform , artificial light . Diddy , alongside his three New York colleagues , crossing the carpeted lobby of the old building . Waving to some men he knows from the Los Angeles office , nodding to the resident personnel . Thep77four men identify themselves to the receptionist , receive a smile in return , and head for the elevators . To the left of the elevators are the high wide wooden doors that once admitted all employees to the old chapel . More restricted ( now ) . " Research and Development . " Later , Diddy will step in , as usual , for a look . We are standing in front of the elevator , which Diddy thinks of as a vertical bore through the center of the building . A bore which might exit into the dome itself . Could one go up there ( now ) ? In all these years Diddy had never inquired about that . It 's about time . Here 's a tiny idea , a pretext . Diddy will propose that a visit to the dome be added to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wednesday at eleven o'clock . Entirely suitable . For this is what the dome had become : an asset for public relations . This third-generation Watkins , noting that the dome was ( now ) just a head missing a body , an idle , spiritually pretentious ornament atop a busy profane building , was unwilling to leave it at that . The wrong head for this body . Hubert 's son considered decapitating the building , then decided upon a reprieve . Invested the useless dome with a new function , one that was strictly secular . The dome , regildedfor the first time in forty years , was designated as the company'semblem . Henceforth , a colored image of the dome was stamped on all microscopes turned out by Watkins &; Company , inscribed at the top of the company 's stationery and business forms , painted on the side of all vehicles owned by the company , stenciled on retail packaging and on the crates in which the instrumentswere shipped to dealers , and featured prominently in advertising . Look , the woman elevator operator has the outline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Oriental chauffeur 's uniform ? Diddy had n't noticed . The elevator doors close . Moving up . The conference room is on the third floor . But maybe it was an insult to revive the dome on these terms ? Let the dead rest , leave what is superseded to its natural repose . The adoption of the dome as the firm 's insignia took place in the mid-1940 's , when wartime government contracts had tripled the company 's profits . Just before a portion of these soaring profits was allocated for constructing the outsized wings that ( now ) flankedp78the old building ; whose bulk and ugliness had the effect of making the dome seem so much smaller and less imposing than it had been . A miniature dome ( now ) , shrunken vestige of its former glory . A kind of toy . Even though its colors were , by constant repainting , kept brilliant . Visible at a considerable distance . But for Diddy , the tiny figure on the letterhead , on the microscopes , and on full-page ads was one thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite another . During the ten years he 'd been with the company , Diddy , a chronic if erratic connoisseur of spiritual independence , had developed his own view of the dome . It was the fantasy expressed in Amos Watkins ' addition to the architect 's original plan that Diddy appreciated . Like the fantasy that produced the original sketchof what became the Micro-Recorderscope . To think of uniting two such different devices in onecompact , high-powered , easily manipulable tool . A boldthought when Amos Watkins had it , around 1900 . Camerasthen were large , cumbersome , bulky , relatively newcontraptions : hoisted and precariously maintained alofton tripods . While microscopes , in existence since thelate sixteenth century , were , had always been , small anddelicate : ready for use as soon as they were set down , secure on their horse-shoe base , upon any table , oreven a window ledge . Watkins had insisted that it wasfeasible to combine the aristocrat and the upstart . Thebig and the small . A bizarre marriage was being planned . That sparkling playful dome that incongruously topped the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Morethan the compulsive godliness of a typical old-style Protestant . InDiddy 's imagination , Watkins was a truly pious man . Not the pietythat 's illustrated by his having been a pillar of the church whonever defaulted on his tithes , who contributed generously to themission in China , who wanted all his employees to pray as well aswork . Not even the inane but convenient piety which persuadesgreedy men that becoming rich is a duty , gratifying to the deity ; for which God must be thanked , on the very site of one 's labor.  |p79Pious  in a larger sense . Old Amos must have been pious about himself . Must have felt lucky , fortunate , blessed . That 's what the dome proclaimed . Obstinate , shameless pleasure in making useful machines and in raking in profits . Pleasure in being himself : not only shrewd Yankee businessman , ardent Methodist and Republican , but also successful eccentric . One who had had his way . It was that energy of self-approval commemorated in the sturdy dome which had always charmed Diddy . Who did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater admiration than for those who could . Those who could affirm their lives . Diddy , not pious toward himself , revered the relics and clues of innocent well-being . The vision of a man who does not inhabit , but simply is , his life . Amos Watkins the Pious had his acolyte . In this mediated sense : Diddy the Pious . There are six people in the crowded elevator , ( now ) passing the second floor . For someone from the Chicago office has gotten on with Harron and Allen and Katz and What's-his-name . We 're chatting loudly , but Diddy is silent . Reassuring and yet also numbingto Diddy 's mind : to be cooped up in a small space . Without alternatives . Focused mainly on the task of maintaining himself in an upright position , without getting in the way of the other bodies or allowing them to get in the way of his . Diddy wishes the elevator could go straight up , into the dome . And nestle there . He could get out first , then rudely close the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the elevator down to the third floor , without him . Another possibility : the elevator might stall between floors . The lights go out , and there 's no explanation . Some of his fellow passengers are bound to panic , but Diddy will remain calm . Offering to go for help , he will get a boost from Jim and force open the trap door in the roof of the elevator cage . Climbingup the cable , hand over hand , is messy work ; cables in elevator shafts are covered with thick grease . But , if necessary , Diddy the Clean would do it . Until he reaches the top . Leaving below him in the shaft the small dark cube of the elevator , immobile , filled with nervous passengers . . . Any of these situations would do , as long as he can gain the dome by himself . Once left to explore the dome alone , who knows what Diddyp80might find ? Is it a great cool place , heavily timbered and sheathed with planks ? Or claustrophobically hot , humid , soaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Diddy will find he is not alone . Perhaps he 'll come across a workman repairing the inner face of the dome ; removing broken planks and decaying timbers , nailing up fresh supports . Or the workman may not be visible at first . Diddy will think he has the whole dome to himself . Until he notices a small exit , hardly big enough for a large man to squeeze through ; and , peering out of the dome , sees the workman precariously stationed on a flimsy scaffold , buckets and brushes at his feet , applying to the outer face the necessary fresh coats of blue and gold . Diddy just wants to see what he 's doing , to watch him work . He would n't intrude , or ask questions , or make any sudden movement that might startle the workman and cause him to lose his balance and fall . A long fall , the equivalent of six stories . Certain death . The body of the workmansprawled on the grass below . Limp , broken , bleeding . Diddy knows what 's possessing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him to be entertaining while on the job . While sharing this small space with four other delegates to the conference ; in an elevator that 's stopping ( now ) at the third floor . Diddy has promised himself not to dwell on the gory anecdote about the railroad worker . Not here . Time for us to get out . " Here we are . " But suppose Diddy ca n't keep his mind reined in tightly ? Suppose , having vowed not to resurrect Incardona in his mind , he does do just that ? Diddy knows a remedy . There 's something else , rather someone else , to think about . When the spectre looms up before his retrograde vision , she comes to caress his face and to kiss his eyes . To banish the workman , to heal Diddy . She never fails to come . But always after . The workman arrives first . Diddy driven and counter-driven . Upon leaving the elevator on the third floor , meeting and greeting . Considering what heals . Who heals . But Diddy was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colleagues first clambered into the black limousine , it instantly occurred to Diddy that , onp81the way to the factory , we might have to pass the WarrenInstitute . Impatient . Looking out of the car window ; insisting that the window be rolled down . About to ask . Then , within minutes after so-called Chang drove the car away from the Rushland , Diddy figured out it was n't going to happen . Diddy , since childhood , gifted with an excellentsense of direction . On the overnight hikes in the woods his brother and he took , during the summers spent at their grandfather Edward Dalton 's farm in Ohio , Paul was always getting lost ; but Diddy 's gift for spatialorientation brought them safely home . Dad had acknowledgedDiddy 's talent , too . Before starting first grade , he 'd sometimes been allowed to come along when his father went out on house calls in the afternoon . His father would start the motor of the Buick , recite the patient 's address while backing out of the driveway ; then let the child tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even places visited just once , allowed Diddy the Navigator to figure out rapidly that the factory lay in the same general direction as the hospital . But that to reach the factory we ought to take a slightly different route out of the center of town . Becoming patient . Diddy could dispense with that quick scanning look at the hospital building he would have managed , had we been carried past it in the black limousine . Could forgo the satisfaction of being able for a brief moment to throw his gaze , let it adhere to the wall : an instantaneous , motorized replica of the gaze of a bashful suitor prowling for hours before his beloved 's darkened house . No matter . Diddy intended to phone Hester during the day and tell her he would come by during the evening visiting hours.  |p82The  first day 's session at the plant . On time . We 're in a spacious , high-ceilinged , wood-paneled room . High windows with maroon drapes . Portraits of past presidentsof the company . Nineteen men seated around the long oval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a pad of paper , and two finely sharpened pencils . A stenographer at the far wall , taking the minutes . Diddy in harness , eager to prove that he can function on the surface of life without slipping into a dark hole . A pompous speech of welcome by Reager . A longer speech by Watkins extolling the company 's democratic structure of decision-making , and not so subtly reminding those present of the profit-sharing scheme enjoyed by all employees in managerial posts . Coffee and sandwiches served ; everyone settled down to work . Memoranda and charts passed around the long table , figures scrawled on the blackboard . Whispering and exchanging of notes . Factions were being grouped and battle lines were drawn up . We were jovial . But there is a tacit signal known to everyone that starts the arguing . Bad feelingsspill from people 's mouths , like cold greasy coffee . When little is at stake , Diddy likes to argue . And what can be at stake when the room is so clean , the space so generously conceived ? When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how much simpler it is for all of us that theconference was divided into exactly two factions . Just two . On one side , those who insisted that the new competitioncould be beaten back by , one , more advertising and , two , a drastic reorganization of distribution and selling procedures . Inefficient personnel had to be weeded out ; dealers made to work harder to retain their franchises ; and salesmen 's territories reapportioned to conformto shifts in population and buying power , for instance , by doubling the sales force in California . Diddy guessed this was the line that the top brass was backing . On the other side , a group of younger executives , advised by some of the scientists and technicians , argued that the basic model of Scope 21 had to be overhauled , to compete favorably with the comparable prod/uct being offered at a lower price by the Yugoslays , and perhaps by the Japanese . Had the Japanese really produced something to rival the company'sinstrument ? Diddy would wait to see it before he fully believed in it . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perched in the center of the oval table . Its caretaker , a balding young scientist , explains that what we 're looking at may be only a provisional versionof their photomicrographic outfit . The apparatus , still undergoingtests , has n't yet been released by the factory , even for sale in Japan . But , already , a superb instrument . Bound to be available in the States soon . Diddy wondered how , if they were as inept as Jim claimed , the company officials had gotten hold of it . Perhaps through orthodox means . Perhaps not . Spirited out of the factory in Nagasaki by a defecting employee or disgruntled junior executive . Someone like Jim , only with yellow skin and slant eyes and straight black hair . Maybe that person was " Chang , " who was then paid off with American citizenship , a handsome uniform , and a sinecure which requires him to act occasionally as a chauffeur for the company . Chang , whose real name was something like Mayamoto . Let 's not kid ourselves , someone three chairs away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new Japanese instrument to ours . Not what the bosses wanted to hear . " Draw those curtains , Goldberg , will you ? The light 's in my eyes , " said Reager irritably . ( Now ) Reager took the floor . Saying that the problem could and ought to be solved in Washington . What about the government 's obligation to use the tariff to protect domestic industries , which could n't possibly compete with the prices set by foreign manufacturerssupplied with endless cheap labor ? Yugoslays and Japs , indeed ! And as for improvements , you gentlemen know that no expense in that sphere has ever been spared . Eighty years of pioneering research stands behind this company . It is unstinting researchthat made the Micro-Recorderscope the outstanding instrument of its type in the world today . Diddy tired of boasting and lies . Tired of having his faith tested . If Reager made the realistic challenge to the company 's positionp84into a crisis of faith among his employees , he was a fool . No one wanted to believe what could n't be believed . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted the conference at all . His idea : to have as little as possible happen . Business was good . Who can imagine things to be different from the way they are today ? But times are changing . The junior men leap back with their arguments as soon as the old man stops . Who is right ? Everybody . Diddy found the arguments of both sides sound . Which policy , then , should be adopted ? Both . But that 's not likely to happen , is it ? Most unlikely that in a single week of meetings the company would embark on two major and mutuallyexclusive programs of development . We 'll be able to choose only one . Which will Diddy choose ? His own recommendations , which he 's to present this afternoon and which took most of his evenings in the last two weeks to prepare , were the outline of a new advertising campaign . Quite properly . Diddy minds his own business . Wishes other people would mind theirs . And he knows that , in the larger dispute , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An easily assembled majority  --  even though Watkins , sucking on his pipe at the far end of the oval table , had said nothingyet . But of the other eighteen , Diddy estimated , five would line up with Comensky and Goldberg of R &D.; Leaving ten behind Reager , if Diddy counted himself . But should n't count himself in yet . Today he feels like doing the unexpected . He 'd been impressed by the minority faction , who came equipped with elaborate diagrams drawn with India ink and models , twice the actual size , of the revamped Micro-Recorderscope , and with long opaque words that spilled from their mouths . Still had n't decided which faction to support . But suspected ( now ) it would be that of the scientists and technicians . Let Reager blow his top . I 'm tired of humoring him . When the meeting broke for lunch , it was already one-thirty . Today we were eating here ; uniformed waitresses were already wheeling in carts with food . Diddy went out to the phone booth in the hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have a phone in her room yet , he left his message with the floor nurse.  |p85When  he returned to the conference room , the work materials had already been cleared from the table and nineteen place settings laid out over a mammoth white plastic tablecloth . Diddy had n't realized how the room stank of tobacco . Before sitting down to his meal , got the pole and pulled the top half of one of the high windowshalfway down . Maybe he was n't just oppressed by the smoke but stalling , too . Not believing he could manage another meal after that heroic breakfast . Certainly not overdone slices of roast beef with lumpy succotash . But Diddy did eat . More than he thought he could . The rest of the afternoon dragged by , painfully . Diddy got up to make his presentation of the new advertising campaign , then concluded by expressing doubts that this tactic would indeed reversethe tide of competition running against the company . Supposea choice has to be made  --  between allocating funds for more advertising or putting more money into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case , I 'd advocate pouring every last cent into research . " When Diddy sat down , Jim gave him a toy salute from across the table . It may very well be that this speech has n't pleased either faction . But at this point , Diddy could n't care less . Is Diddy pleased with himself ? That 's what 's important . Does the old anodyne of work still deaden the pain , still take him out of himself ? Transform him into nothing more than a function of his situation ? Perhaps too much has happened in the last twenty-four hours . Ca n't be as opaque as he 'd like . Not any more . Diddy becoming vitrified , like paper soaked in grease . Diddy tuned out of most of the ensuing discussion . Words are starting to thicken again , and acquire that curious muffled edge , something like an echo , that renders them almost material and makes their meaning easier to ignore . Diddy wants to ignore whatever he can . Does n't notice that , by four o'clock , his back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roomy chair that 's mainly wood , with only a token skin of leather on the seat . For better or for worse , Diddy not very observant this afternoon . Diddy , inside himself . Which , for Diddy , does n't necessarily mean being in his body . In his mind , then ?  |p86Pass  over the failure of words , their hypermaterialization . Other ways that Diddy has of understanding the world are failing , too . A lapse in sensation itself . Except for registering changes in the temperature and amount of tobacco pollution in the high-ceilinged room . Except for being annoyed by the fidgeting and chainsmokingof Ambergate , the company 's treasurer , sitting to Diddy 's left . Except for watching Pete La Salle , head of Export , Watkins ' nephew , skillfully dozing without the others noticing . Except for noticing with mild revulsion that Buchananof the Production Department , sitting to his right , chews his cuticles savagely . Except for following the subtle waning of the afternoonlight streaming through the high windows of the conference room . A random suite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly present . Being somewhere inside himself , anticipating this evening . Repeatedly , Diddy the Romantic cautioned himself to have sensible thoughts about Hester . Making love with a girl once often means nothing these days : no more to her than to you . And even if their encounter was truly audacious and sexually stirring , do n't expect its special quality to live on in this evening 's meeting . With another room , another demon of place . Expect nothing . Yesterday was unique . Diddy transfixed with bewilderment , guilt , fear , and the longing for a healing touch . Hester in her endless darkness , frightened by the train 's unexplained stop in the tunnel . Their encounter on the Privateer was too charged and urgent . Its searing flavor bound to be diluted in the milky atmosphere of ordinary circumstances . A good thing that he has thus prepared himself . For the hospital visit , both rich and empty , was a strain . It starts badly . With Hester thanking Diddy for the flowers , in words that sound lifeless andp87dutiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Now ) a medium-sized room on the seventh floor of the principal building of the Warren Institute . Generous dimensions for a private room . And with a handsome view of Monroe Park . Diddy wishes she could see out the window . Unnerved by the blind girl 's infinite enclosure in herself . As he had n't been , really , yesterday . But Hesterseems diminished , less absolute in this room than in the train compartment , or in the corridor , or in the washroom , or in the club car . Or even when she materialized sporadically in Diddy 's head during last night 's excoriating vigil . Wait . Probably , it 's not some change in Hester herself . Not her fault , any more than his . Her aunt 's ? For Hester and Diddy were n't alone . Mrs. Nayburn was in the room when Diddy arrived ; and she stayed , she stayed . From the beginning , heaping attention on him ; virtually ignoring her niece . As the woman becomes more flattering , loquacious , overbearing , Hester @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was frustrated by , in the early part of the train journey . Consider the only other time the three of them were alone in the same space : when they rode out to the hospital in a taxi last night . Had they been as uncomfortable as ( now ) ? Diddy tried to recall . Blank , at least about this . All he remembers is wanting to break away from them for a second in the waiting room . To buy a newspaper . In case , by some miracle of printing technology , a late afternoon 's violent death can be processed so swiftly into words , afterwards into type face , that the story appears in the evening paper . Then realizing that was absurd . . . Except for continuing sporadically to wish he had gone for a newspaper before getting into the taxi and feeling more of the same indigestible anxiety and numbness he 'd been enduring for hours , he could remember nothing of the taxi ride . In the hospital room . The aunt is firing questions at Diddy about his family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his apartment and its location . " Oh , how nice ! From what I read in the papers , you ca n't be too careful about getting into a good neighborhoodin New York these days . It 's getting to be that a white person is hardly safe anywhere now . . . . " Since Diddy 's apartment is n't inp88a " good neighborhood , " he ca n't decide whether Mrs. Nayburn , besides being compulsively ugly-hearted , is ignorant about New York , devious , or merely inattentive . More questions . When Diddy said she might have heard of his brother , who was a concert pianist , she went up an octave , shrilling : " My goodness ! Do n't tell me your brother is Paul Harron . Really ? How exciting ! " Not only has she heard of Paul , she owns his recording of the Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto . Was she going to ask Diddy to get an autograph for her ? This was n't the first time Diddy regretted mentioning Paul to a new friend or acquaintance . Paul 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , light ; it falls to the floor with a thump . To mention his brother ca n't help but sound weighted , like bragging . Diddy worried that 's what the girl may think : her silence distresses him . But knew better than to suspect her aunt may also decide he was boasting . Modesty or reticence was n't within Mrs. Nayburn 's range . The only delicacy with such a woman : to be absolutely mute . Since everything he discloses seems to please her . The all too predictable climax arrives when she nervously venturesto inquire whether Diddy is married . Diddy , angry , tries to expel the word " Divorced " from his mouth in a casual tone . Damn the woman 's prying ! She must have fixed on him as a prospective husband for her handicapped niece not later than the very moment that extravagant batch of flowers was delivered this morning to Hester 's room . Maybe she 's not counting on the success of the forthcoming operation . And the immoderate warmth of Mrs. Nayburn'sattentions to Diddy suggests that Hester has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approves of  --  or knows about . Diddy unused to having what he wants , or might want , handed to him without heavy effort . Though women liked him , Diddy never altogether trusted their approval . A precarious sense of his own manhood . The self-contempt that began to infect his will when Paul overtook , then outstripped him in vitality and achievement . A shameful envy of the blind , uncompassionate vitality of men who looked like Incardona ; men of the sort Diddy 's always disapproved of and disliked , been disliked by , feared . It follows then that should Diddy want Hester , he should have to overcome almost insur/mountable barriers . And just this normal state of affairs , her aunt was suggesting , was n't true ( now ) ; as if Hester was hers to dispose of . Mrs. Nayburn was promising wordlessly that the girl might be his without a struggle . No competition ? Despite the girl 's beauty ? Long fine blond hair , hidden eyes , delicate hooked nose , wide mouth , slim neck , fleshy shoulders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hester is beautiful , is n't she ? Diddy trying to be fair , to see the girl ( now ) as extraordinary and compelling as she appeared to him yesterday . But her aunt 's indiscriminate chatter and his necessarilymechanical responses have muted Diddy 's energies for perceiving , silenced his feelings , frozen the nerves that animate his flesh . Diddy the Stupefied . About to stand up , say good night to both of them . When Mrs. Nayburn , sensing perhaps that she was n't furthering what she took to be her niece 's interests by staying around , gets up quicker . " Lovey , I just remembered I have to buy some things . " To him : " You 'll keep Hester company for the rest of the hour , wo n't you . . . Dalton ? May I call you Dalton ? " " Of course , " Diddy says . Laden with one parcel and a bulging shopping bag like those of yesterday , Mrs. Nayburn leaves the room . Almost immediately , the air lightens . Breathing itself less oppressive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood starts to flow , his nerves begin to pulse , his vision clears . Can ( now ) really look at the girl . Smothered in nightgown , sheets , and a blanket ; theshapeless body extending the length of the bed giveslittle hint of what Diddy knows to be its subtle contours . What 's unchanged is Hester 's face , a fourth of which ismasked by the dark glasses . Hester seems to be looking at him . As she did yesterday , she can direct toward him an intelligent facsimile-look with movements of her head . But never real looking : an exiting from the head by means of sight , an exchange of looks , complicity with the eyes . The faces of the blind are not in dialogue with other faces as faces . Only with other faces as flesh . Touch , the sole complicity.  |p90Her  expression not perceptibly altered since Mrs. Nayburn 's departure . Had Hester 's face been equally inexpressive yesterday ? With Diddy hardly noticing , so profound and urgentwas the need he 'd felt for union with the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " a face " atop " the body , " one only sighted people can entertain of themselves and of other people ? Among blind people , the face is just another part of the body . The independent life of faces depends on sight . If sight goes , the face largely dies . Or becomes tentative , provisional . A representation  --  maybe skillful  --  of a face ; not a real face . An object-face . The faces of the blind are set above their bodies like lanterns that have been turned down , or extinguished . A face with dead eyes , lacking the visual clues for learningexpressiveness from other faces , will never invent that whole vocabulary by itself . Haphazard or approximatesignals of feeling may be attempted , out of the longing to conform to an imaginary uniform ideal . But were it true to its own condition , the face without sight has neither reason nor means to become any more expressivethan a hand or a foot or a breast . How does an inexpressive face age ? More slowly , one would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned to be consistently expressive by watching other faces , probably remains unlined many years after the exertions of expression have creased and wrinkled seeing faces of the same chronological age . Maybe Hester is n't as young as she looks . With another rhythm of use , another rhythm of aging . Is Diddy looking too intently ? The wrong power microscope . Step back to get the unassisted view . Perhaps Hester is just being quiet , waiting for him to speak first . Something stirs in her face . Around the mouth , that 's where he must look . If for ordinary people the eyes rule the face , with blind people it must be the mouth . Therep91was the complicity he sought . Not of eyes and looks . But of mouths and touch . Yet Diddy does n't feel like kissing Hester at this moment . Somethingtoo passive about her , too willful in him . The hospital room is inert , dead . How different from the compartment on yesterday 's train , a space that was buoyant , that became an independent vehicle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close , droning space of the washroom in which they both stood ; clinging and mingling with each other . Diddy slouched in the chair near the foot of the bed , faintly reviving the hurt in his spine that had begun in the conference room about four o'clock . " Already started your tests ? " he says stiffly . " They took some blood this morning . An ECG . A urine sample . That 's all . " " Those are just routine pre-operative tests . Has anyone been around to look at your eyes ? " " Not yet . " Diddy does n't know what words to bring up next . He 's far away . Looking out the window , enjoying what Hester can not  --  a view . Colors . Moving shapes . The recurring distribution and thinning out of things into " near " and " far . " " Want some chocolates ? Aunt Jessie brought me a box , but I do n't like them . " Where are the chocolates ? On the night table . " No thanks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might serve as a mnemonicdevice . A memory room , a series of places to which Diddy might return in imagination at some future time ; as he moves through the room , extracting from the memorized places the images he had stored in them . But the featureless room seems to resist such a use . All the hospital has supplied converges on a single color . The walls are off-white , and so are the muslin curtains . The wooden chest of drawers is painted a flat white , as is the iron bed , which has a white blanket over the usual white sheets . The white metal table beside the bed has a white Formica top ; the shiny white porce/lain base of the table lamp offers the faintest contrast with the dull sheen of the white plastic shade . And the two chairs  --  indicating an official maximum of two visitors ?  --  arecovered in grainy white Leatherette . Had he not known better , Diddy might have surmised that ophthalmologists find white to be easier than any other color on ailing eyes . The maroon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bathrobe across the foot of Hester 's bed , the tan leather sandals on the floor beside her bed , and Diddy 's flowers are the only things in the room that are n't white . " I like your flowers , " Hester says . As if she could read his mind . " You did n't believe me , did you , when I thanked you before ? And I know why . My aunt was in the way . But you should have , you know . I 'm not polite . If I say something , I mean it . " She smiles radiantly . And Diddy is there to see what he partly longs to see . A new face , delicate and alive . Diddy pulled back from the wide space into which he has wandered : cold , harshly lit , stony . Drawn back , gladly , to the smaller space of tenderness surrounding the girl . Melting . A sudden rush of sensual , weary happiness . He springs from his chair to the one nearer Hester that her aunt had vacated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the girl 's arm . But not to bare flesh or to any texture that felt naked . She 's wearing a long-sleeved flannel nightgown whose rough texture denies yesterday 's memory of flesh . Withholds any further knowledge Diddy 's left cheek might gain of the shape of Hester 's smooth firm arm . She , too , must dislike the feel of such material on her skin . Would n't it be depressing if the nightgown were n't even hospital issue , but some bargain-basement treasure imposed on the girl by Mrs. Nayburn ? He sighs . " Well . . . How are you ? Really ? " " Sad . " As if startled , Diddy looks up . She begins stroking his closecroppedhair , and he bends his head again . " Why ? " " I 'm not hopeful about the operation . And I 've been worryingp93about you , remembering what you wanted to do to yourself yesterday . I was afraid that today you 'd regret not having gone through with it . " What effort of will for Diddy not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Hester , listen ! Once more , that was n't what happened yesterday on the train . I committed that folly a month ago . " An effort to remain stilled , huddled under her caress . To continue accepting her touch : placid , but imperious . " Please believe me ! Can you forgive me for have lied to you at first ? Because what really happened yesterday was something else , something completely different . It 's what I told you about . . . after . The fight with the workman .... " Diddy wondering if he should go further . He has no intention of producing the newspaper clipping and reading it aloud to Hester . After summoning a nurse on the floor to stand by , someone who can look over his shoulder and verify for Hester 's benefit that he 's reading what 's actually printed there . Since that 's Diddy decision , should he have gone even this far ? Remember that Hester is the deluded one , not he ; that it 's her faculties which , at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so easy to do ( now ) , would be a dangerous triumph . More prudent for Diddy to let the girl continue thinking he 's had a hallucination . " Hell , I know you do n't believe any of this , " he adds . " Do you ? You do n't believe I was ever out of the compartment , much less off the train . " Diddy hoping he 's covered his tracks ( now ) . Not that it matters much what he says at this moment . However long he goes on urgingHester to believe in yesterday 's murder , she wo n't be convinced  --  if Diddy does n't display the irrefutable printed evidence in his possession since this morning . Why should she be ? But even if Hester does n't credit his confession , does n't become the sharer of his secret , she still may have reactions that spell heartacheor trouble . Believing in Diddy the Innocent , she may become afraid of Diddy the Deluded . A natural , self-protective reaction : for the relatively sane to fear the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if she is n't afraid , worried . Then , when worryp94becomes too painful , she may relay his tale to someone else ; maybe one of her doctors . Not to betray Diddy , since Hester believes he has n't done anything , but just to get professional advice on how best to answer a lunatic friend whenever he starts insisting again on the literal truth of his fantasy . And that third person might connect Daddy 's so-called delusion with the item in today 's CourierGazette . And call the police . Hester has been silent for a long time . " What are you thinking ? " Diddy asks . All right to move his head ( now ) . Not angry , not running away . Sits up straight , then leans over to rub his lips on Hester 's warm cheek . A kiss she does n't overtly welcome . " What 's the matter , Hester ? " " I 'm thinking . You know , this is something we should n't talk about . At least not now . About what happened in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , Dalton . I may even be doing you some harm . " " Harm ? " echoes Diddy , astonished . " Yes . Believe me , it 's not that I want to injure you . But I have the feeling , it 's hard to put into words , that something bad for you might come from me . Do n't ask me what . I 've only a very dim idea . But you 'll have to trust my judgment anyway . I may know very little , but you do n't know anything about it at all . " Diddy is mystified , balked . How could Hester determine anythingimportant about the two of them so soon ? Should n't he insist ( now ) that she explain ? Then frustrated , because he ca n't . Further questions seemed like bullying . And also relieved . Yet if they have made a pact to steer clear of that inexhaustible topic , the world of the tunnel , not much is left to discuss . Hester is n't easy to talk to . But he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his revulsion at wasting words , once more condemned to flabby conversation . To the volley of insensate questions , gathering useless information . Well , he might as well plunge in . Are you comfortable ? Are the nurses pleasant ? Do you like your doctor ? How 's the food ? How soon is the operation ?  | " Do n't , " she says sharply , shaking her head . " You know you do n't want to talk to me that way . And I do n't want you to . Please ! " Diddy astonished . Does she know this , too ? But unable just to be grateful for Hester 's intervention , passing on without comment to better words . " God knows , I do n't want to ask you a lot of empty questions . " Diddy has to explain . " But I feel awkward . I do n't know what to say , or what to do here . " She touches his hair . " What you should do is get up and go . Without saying anything . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a long time without replying . She 's right , of course . Clearer and braver than he . But there 's one questionhe has to ask , foolish as it may seem . " If I go . . . I mean , when I go , you will hear me , wo n't you ? You wo n't think this time I 'm still in the room with you ? " Hester sits up a little higher in the bed , propped against the pillows ; folds her hands in her lap ; turned in Diddy 's direction . She nods . But does n't say anything . Diddy does n't want to get up . The silence between them has become very thick  --  full of magical , distressing , electric , paralyzed feelings . Diddy feels magnetized , then dizzy . A kind of metallic vertigo . With a thin narrow lining of panic . The footsteps of nurses and visitors in the corridor seem especially loud . Perhaps Diddy will sit here , enthralled forever . Despite the vertigo , a part of his feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand for the first time what it 's like to be blind , " he says . " Do you ? " " I know how imprisoning it must be , do n't misunderstand . And what a cruel deprivation of ordinary freedom it is . But still , I imagine , there 's something good in it . It makes easy  --  necessary-a certain experience that 's rare and enviable . It 's the experience of paying attention all the time , with that attention never slackening , so that everything is at once very distinct and very complicated . " " That 's part of it . " She seems to be smiling . " And I 've thought of something else , that 's harder to describe . " Diddy closed his eyes . " The world of blind people . . . I mean thep96world you see , the world I sometimes inhabit in my imagination , too . . . it 's terribly unstable . There 's always a hole just in front of your feet . You know about the hole , yet you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time . . . And very free , too . It does n't really matter , matter in the old way , I mean , if you . . . if you fall . " " Yes . That , too . " Diddy wrenched his eyes open . Ashamed . Insensitive , self-absorbedDiddy . " I wish I could stop talking , " he says wistfully . Hester did n't answer . Perhaps she was going to help him . A breeze had come up and was ruffling the curtains . Although already night , it seemed to get darker . Diddy sat a while longer , sometimes looking at the girl , sometimes comparing shades of whiteness , sometimes gazing at nothing in particular . After a time he stood up , threw his coat over his arm , and went out the door without saying a word . Diddy took a taxi straight back to the Rushland , and found Jim disconsolately hanging about the lobby , pretending to be waiting for someone . Almost eight-thirty . Meeting Jim ( now ) not what Diddy would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of the evening . Feared to feel himself , by ordinary contact with people , repudiating or blunting the subtle connection with Hester . Still , he was n't too sorry . Perhaps running into Jim was for the best , since Diddy did n't altogether trust himself to be alone . Judged that he did n't yet merit that noble condition . Once safe upstairs in Room 414 , is n't he likely to give way to renewed brooding and to morbid indecision ? His resolve to stay away from the police , at least not to go ( now ) , was shaky ; too new to be truly binding . This resolve was no mere whim  --  but it was as boneless , feathery , and contingent as a whim . It lacked the weight that a genuine decisionought to have , and does eventually put on . With time . Like a premature baby that must be stored in the incubator until itp97reaches a normal bulk . Diddy 's newly fledged hankering for life needed coddling . A special diet . Only the fit survive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the hotel with Jim . He would nourish his decision , he would feed himself . Proper self-feeding apparently requires the company of another person . Diddy has discovered something about his habits of the last four weeks . Particularly why and how he has virtually stopped eating . Until this time he 'd allowed two hypotheses about his not eating . An unconscious penance imposed by his body for the fiasco of a month ago ; or a dismal sequel to his humiliating regimen in the hospital . Both true enough , perhaps . But he 's neglected a crucial detail . It was after Diddy came out of the hospital that he 'd begun to take all his meals alone . Refusing any dinner invitations . And , as an excuse to get out of business lunches , inventing a daily appointment at noon with a doctor who was giving Diddy shots to prevent a recurrenceof his illness . Call it queasiness , call it a fast . It was something of both . Whateverit was , Diddy resolved , it must stop . Diddy who has already put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jim eaten dinner yet ? No . Fine . Jim seemed relieved by the invitation . Diddy flushed with good intentions . Using words , he will go along with what interests Jim ; and he will just breathe . Breathing in , breathingout . He must n't be alone . Diddy found that the appetite for food that he 'd prayerfully ordered with the lobster dinner arrived . But what about fattening up the soul ? Putting muscle into the weightless bald will ? Growing a skin around the rickety frame of the feelings that wo n't bruise at the mildest touch ? Ah , these are harder tasks . It was n't so easy : breathing in , breathing out . Jim 's banter , an asylum of inane , cranky wholesomeness at breakfast this morning , was driving a nail into Diddy 's brain tonight . Could barely listen to Jim , and his own share of the conversation was humorless , forced . Even Jim notices , and several times inquired if he were ill . Diddy kept saying no , he felt fine . But then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  |p98you  really have been looking pretty run down lately , Dalton . " And advise him to ski this winter , or take up tennis , or work out several times a week at a gym . Diddy did n't understand what had misfired . Kept trying to make the meal work . Which is why he dawdled over his hearty portion ; not because he had trouble finishing everything on his plate . And why he ordered extra cups of coffee , and then a brandy he did n't want . Diddy stalling , hoping to find out how it 's done . Later Diddy gave up . Ashamed to be exploiting this decent enough guy whom he did n't like but did n't not like either . He was bad company for Jim , who 'd been perking up as the sulky units of clock-time slid by . Diddy aware that ( now ) Jim has gotten his second wind , is feeling full-blooded enough to go out and , as he 'd say , paint the town red ; is lingering out of considerateness , aware that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , and reluctant to leave him in the almost deserted hotel restaurant . " The Pine Room . " Clearly Diddy 's responsibility : to dissolve the bond of politeness , throw open the doors for Jim . Which he did , first yawningand then mock-confessing to a revived Jim that he was tired and heading for bed . " I guess you have n't really kicked that virus you came down with last month , " Jim said , scarcely concealing his delight at being released from Diddy 's company . The two men stood in the lobby . Jim slapped Diddy awkwardly on the shoulder . " Good night , Dalt , " he said . " Get some shut-eye , you hear . I mean , do n't do anything I would n't do , huh ? " At the revolving door , he waved . Diddy at the elevator waved back ; went upstairs . Staring resentfully in the bathroom mirror at his morose face . Trying , by sheer will , to thaw himself out . What a burden Diddy the Disaffected is to himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he immediately got into bed . Although Diddy hardly expects to sleep before first enduring the usual lengthy ordeal , there 's no place comfortable enough to settle in besides bed in this small , meagerly furnished room . But Diddy does n't know himself as well as he thinks . Had n't even time to start devoting attention to the flashing yellow sign outside his window . Diddy thep99Done-In was indeed terribly tired , and fell into sleep with all the lights on before realizing what he was doing . Diddy dreamed that night . Not as unpleasant a drama as he might have invented . No stark images of the slain workman or of the ambiguous sexual catharsis with Hester . It was a verbose dream , the dream of an exhausted man . Two persons from the train on Sunday , the stamp dealer in the tweed suit and the priest , are discussing the hobby they have in common . But it is n't stamp collecting . In opposite seats of the compartment , leaning intently toward each other , they were passing a handsome shell back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a shell that Diddy recognizes : Conus gloriamaris , the Glory of the Sea . The two men are lavishing praise upon the shell , calling each other 's attention to its intricate whorls and markings . Not clear to Diddy who owns the Glory of the Sea . If it belongs to only one of the men , the other shows no signs of envy or covetousness . And if the precious object is their joint possession , it does n't seem to cause any dispute or friction between them . Diddy , both a spectator within the dream , sitting in the compartmentnext to the man in the tweed suit , and outside , somewhere , nowhere . Electrified with envy . He wants the shell for himself , though aware that he 's succumbed to an ugly feeling . For Diddy neither admires the shell nor finds it beautiful . Were he , while strolling alone along some empty beach , to come upon the Glory of the Sea resting on top of the damp brown bubble-studded sand , he would n't honor it with a glance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which case he 'd kick it or , better yet , grind it under his heel . Diddy the Bad covets the shell ( now ) solely because he observes the value set on it by the man in the tweed suit and the priest . But he has no qualifications for ownership . Unlikely that these men would consider surrendering their prize to Diddy , who collects stamps . Thus permanently excluded from the indefinitely renewable joy that passes back and forth between the two collectors , Diddy grows more and more frustrated . Must do something . He does n't wrench the shell from their hands . For some unclarified reason knows hep100ca n't take physical possession of the shell ; at least not ( now ) . But he can diminish their pleasure in it . Taking moral possession of it , so to speak . In an instant , act . Before the claims of conscience begin to whimper ; materializing their rusty , familiar fetters . Diddy intervenesbrutally . Merely by giving a lecture , one which distills all the rage and disappointment choking him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his seat up to the baggage rack . Sits leaning forward , for there 's not enough room to straighten his back ; with his feet dangling . Looks down at the two men and begins to harangue them . First point : the great era of conchology is definitely over . There 's no point in trying to return to the past , is there ? He looks below to check the impact his words are having on the two men . Already , they seem less elated . This hobby , Diddy continues , flourished in the nineteenth century , when there were still genuine discoveries to be made . ( Now ) everything is known and has been catalogued , these objects are no longer worthy of attracting the fancy of a truly serious person . Shell collecting , as one might expect , has passed into the hands of sentimental amateurs , who are content with arbitrary samplings and arrangements . And amateurs are notoriouslycredulous , easily taken in by fakes , forgeries , and misattributions . With no one to uphold the old standards of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glazed , and tinted objects claiming to be shells . Which are really the beautified corpses of shells . One result of their being too numerous was that shells ceased to be treated with the respect properly owing to a wholly natural object , and taste in shells was irrevocably corrupted . In fact , Diddy raises his voice , eager to drive his point home , good taste in all domains fell into decline . An esoteric bit of information : the ruinous desire to improve on nature began with the first man who set about to convert a shell into a work of art . That , said Diddy the Capricious , spitting at the priest , is the true account of original sin . The priest is quietly wiping saliva off the front of his jacket , as Diddy goes on . If Mrs. Nayburn were here , she 'd be thrusting her handkerchief at him before he 'd time to reach for his own.  |p101Second  point : the poor shells themselves , defenseless as the soft molluscs they once housed , could do nothing to halt this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few struggled , in vain . How could they resist , much less hope to prevail , having no eyes ? So not only their quantity but their very substance altered . Shells became coarse , brutish . Look closely , Diddy says , at that shell you 've been fondling . It 's true that once the Glory of the Sea was the rarest , costliest , the most coveted of shells . In the early 1800 's , there were only two known specimens in the entire world ; both found in the waters east of New Guinea . But by the end of the centurythe shell was being found in indecently profuse numbers . The price plummeted . ( Now ) anyone can send away for one of the debased , modern specimens . Not to mention the carefully crafted imitations being turned out by several factories in Japan . " Now , let 's have a look at this particular specimen . . . " Diddy snaps his fingers brusquely . The man in the tweed suit clambers to his feet and reverently passes the shell up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bother with the stethoscope or the reflex hammer . What 's wrong with this shell , he declares , is plain enough to the unaided senses . With a negligent thrust of his right index finger , Diddy calls attention to the fact that the body whorl is tilted in the reverse direction of the true Glory of the Sea , and that the reticulations of the whorl run transversely to those of authentic specimens . Shows the abashed connoisseurs below him that the shell has a badly chipped lip , too , and a thickened margin in exactlythe wrong place . They react to this denunciation of their prize with appropriate dismay . Diddy , unpitying , persisting . " You 've been cheated . A worthless trinket ! " Callously tosses it down for them to catch , if they can . " In short , gentlemen , " Diddy concludes triumphantly , " what you are holding in your hands is a murdered and broken shell . " Diddy stares down at the two men contemptuously , as they frantically handle the shell and peer into it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Diddy has sized up what kind of people he 's up against . The priest and the dealer are large , fat men ; and therefore partial to small things . Stamps , shells , dolls , key rings , matchboxes , little magazines , recorders , small cars ,  |p102miniature  dogs , minor paintings , little virtues . Diddy likes big virtues ; and large , strong things . Nothing exquisite or fragile suits his tastes . A slug of gin any day for him , in preference to a bowl of jasmine tea from Peking . Still , he can feel protective toward what is delicate or vulnerable . Right ( now ) , for instance , Diddy worries that the fat priest is taking up far too much room , more than his third of the seat ; squeezing Mrs. Nayburn and Hester . Diddy 's concern is needed to rectify the priest 's gross conduct . They 're probably too polite to complain . But the blond girl and her aunt are n't in the compartment any more . Probably disturbed by so much arguing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Diddy , having boldly taken an unpopularposition , will have to stand his ground . The silken-voiced priest asks Diddy , who has admitted to not being a conchologist , the source of his information . Diddy knowing that his whole lecture is a pack of lies . And delivered with such a clear conscience . Diddy the Dauntless or Diddy the Depraved ? But wait , maybe what he 's been saying is true . Without his knowing it . A lucky break , that perhaps he once saved a newspaperarticle on the Glory of the Sea which set forth everything one might want to know about it . Triumphant Diddy replies to the priest , citing that definitive unchallengeablearticle . Adding that , needless to say , he always carries the clipping in his wallet . For just such emergencies of credibility as this . The two men ask to be allowed to examine the clipping . Is n't that suspicious ? Clever Diddy smells danger in their reasonable request . Suppose they intend to confiscate his clipping  --  either tear it up or pocket it themselves . Should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has lost the only hard evidencehe possesses for his fraudulent case against the shell . So Diddy tells them he 'll bring out the clipping some other time ; they 'll have to take his word for it right ( now ) . Then begins his whole speech over again . As he is hectoring the two men from above their heads , Diddy fears he 's overdoing it . A thesis utterly remote from the truth does n't , in the end , convince or deceive anyone . So his destructive intention wo n't appear too blatant , clever Diddy decides that it'sp103time to call attention to some of the shell 's virtues . The fine granulationson the outer valve , the delicate tones with which the shell is ringed or banded . But just as he 's getting his eulogy underway , Diddy observes that these good features no longer exist . The shell is ( now ) as unequivocally ugly as he had maliciously pronounced it to be . The two collectors see that just as clearly as Diddy does . In disgust , they hurl the shell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throw anything from the train window . " Suddenly Diddy feels contrite . Reviles himself for having been mean-spirited , dishonest . Has slandered something beautiful . Thereby , ignorant that he had such powers , turning it into somethingugly . At this point in the dream , Diddy is reminded of blackenedAndy twitching on his funeral pyre while the neighborhood kids stand by , jeering . He wants to retrieve the shell , hoping that he can restore it , resurrect something of its former beauty and reawakenthe esteem of its disgruntled , gullible ex-owners . " Wait , " he shouts to the two men , " I 'll be right back . " What Diddy does is to jump from his high perch , eyes tightly closed , off the rapidly moving train . Do not throw oneself from the train window ? Falling is simple , if you do n't think about it . Landing , Diddy has scraped some skin off his knees and palms ; like a kid , Diddy himself when a kid , sliding into first base . Pain flickers , subsides . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sees he 's in a dark tunnel . Although the train , maintaining its high speed , has already flashed out of Diddy 's sight , he is n't worried about being able to catch up with it eventually , far ahead ( now ) along the track , and climb aboard again . After he 's found the shell . If there were light , Diddy could use a microscope . Purpose : seeing the unseen . Method : enlarging small objects . But without proper external light , optical microscopes are useless . Diddy must n't underestimate the difficulty of what he aims to do . It 's no easy task to locate so small an object as a conical shell about five inches long , unassisted , in the dark . Diddy 's task almost as hard as these fiendishly difficult assignments passed out to ingenuous young princes in fairy tales , as a test of their courage and innocence . But the young prince , long before he collapses in despair , is invariably accosted by a benevolent old crone with untidy grayp104hair and small sharp eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his cause , or by some helpful little animal gifted with human speech , who volunteers a secret password or gives some necessary directions . No one is helping Diddy . Diddy wanders through the damp tunnel , and doubles back . Then makes the same round trip again . Always fearful , because he ca n't see well , that he may inadvertently tread on the shell and shatter it . Would the light , bony , inanimate structure bleed ? Could a tiny , frightened mollusc still be hiding inside ? What seems like hours limp by , without Diddy having any success . Diddy the Discouraged . But then something changes in the topography of his quest that wipes out failure ; makes everything come out right . Anothervictory for Diddy 's unshowy , methodical mind . Good mind . Abruptly though unclearly , Diddy understands the reason why , despite all his hard thorough scanning of the dark tunnel ground as he marches back and forth , he 's been unable to find the pink and white Glory of the Sea . It 's because he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no longer small , is as vast and capaciousas the tunnel . Tunnel and shell can substitute for each other , so Diddy can wander in either as he sees fit . That for this moment he half walks and half climbs along the slippery , whorled inner face of the shell relieves some of the alarm Diddy felt over a fact noted early in his fruitless walking , when in the tunnel . What was alarming was how much sharper the curve of the track seemed ( now ) than it did before . Diddy leaves that " before " unexamined , feeling himself excused by the well-known rule that there 's no time in dreams , only space . But rules of thought are made to be thought through , surpassed . If that has n't occured to Diddy , is it because he 's lazy ? or evasive ? or merely not very bright ? Does n't he know there is not only time but times ; many times ; some continuous , others intermittent , running simultaneouslyor concurrently or disjunctively ? Somewhere he does know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the other time he was in the tunnel . As instructed , the desk clerk phoned Room 414 Tuesday morningat six-fifty . Diddy , already awake , requested the Courier/Gazette to be brought to his room immediately . Today he will be able to take a better sounding of this deep business . First , by whether there 's a follow-up on yesterday 's story on page 16 . Second , for he assumes there is , by the length and position of the new story . Is it longer or shorter than yesterday 's four chunky paragraphs ? Has it been moved further front or to the back of the paper ? And what 's the second article 's theme ? More about Incardona ? Or developments in the inquiry the police are making into possible negligence on the part of the railroad ? Diddy in suspense , let down . Today 's paper , just as scrupulously read as the two yesterday , contained nothing about the workman 's death . Not even a paragraph on the obituary page . Nor so much as a line about investigating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so that the furor is really over ? Reducing an arbitrary and violent death to something just as slight and unrecurringas a half-column of newsprint ? Of course , Diddy had n't forgotten Incardona 's funeral , which , according to yesterday 's " Final , " takes place this afternoon at two o'clock . If he goes , it wo n't be in order to view Incardona 's mangled corpse . Diddy the Ghoul has not yet been dreamed of . A corpse which it 's unlikely Diddy could see even if he wanted to ; usually , when the body is mutilated , the coffin is sealed immediately . Nor , if he attends , will it be to mourn Incardona . Does n't honestly feel grief over the workman 's death . Horror still , though more remotely . Little apart from that . What mainly prompted Diddy to consider attending the services at the funeral home  --  at the cemetery he 'd be too conspicuous  --  is the wish to set eyes on Incardona 's widow and son . Their reality had to become welded to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay to rest forever his cramping residual doubt , despite the incontrovertible evidence of the Courier-Gazette story , whether he 'd ever had the encounter with the swarthy workman . Especially wanted to see Thomas Francis , age 11 . In whom , if this is the son of the man Diddy killed , he 'd surely see at least a trace of resemblance to his father . Then Diddy would be certain that he 'd gotten off the Privateer when it stalled in the tunnel . Hadp106assaulted someone . And that the someone was Angelo Incardona , who was dead . The other decision awaiting Diddy 's attention : whether or not to visit Hester today . He 'd awakened feeling he does n't want to go . Yesterday Hester virtually sent him away . Faulty in knowledge ; awkward in conduct . He should n't return until he understands more about the barriers that separate them . Further , Diddy does n't want to suggest to either of the women , by paying two consecutive visits , that Hester could count on a visit every night during the week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not a hard decision to make . Just a postponement , since he could see Hester any time this week ; tomorrow night , if he likes . But Incardona 's funeral would take place only once . All Diddy has to come up with is a plain Yes or No . Should he go this afternoon ? No answer . Diddy repeats the question . Should he ? Still no answer . How complicated everything seems . And is . Something morbid in this plan . Diddy the Peeping Tom . Spying on people 's grief for his own splintered motives . Not to mention the bad taste : a murderer piously , rather than gloatingly , in attendance at his victim 's funeral . Something merely self-destructive in it , too . Perhaps Diddy just wants to put himself in a situation where he could suddenly find himself at the feet of the widow and orphan , sobbing out his confession . Maybe the desire for a quick confessionis drawing Diddy , balked by the thought of the complex mediations of police and judiciary , to the Floral Gardens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The phone rings . A telegram from Duva saying he wo n't be up for the conference at all . Special delivery letter follows . What was Diddy thinking before the phone rang ? Well , he could n't decide ( now ) . And meanwhile he was neglecting the noncontroversialorder of the day . Let 's get in step with that for a time . Make his appearance downstairs , breakfast with Jim and the others , go out to the plant , take part in the morning meetings . One foot in front of the other . The decision could be made just before lunch . Diddy put on his jacket , checked his briefcase to see he had everything he needed . Went downstairs.  |p107In  the elevator , Jim saying in a low voice to Katz , " Hey , this town is wide open . Things have sure changed around here in the last couple a months . You could have knocked me over with a feather . Plenty of after-hour clubs . And all those places on Parker Street . " " Where ? " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jim always grinned at his own jokes . Reager reaching the door of the conference room at the same time as Diddy . A chilly " Good morning , Harron , " as he passes into the room first . I 'm going to be spared an evening with the family this trip , Diddy thought ; perhaps dinner at the club as well . Reager 's disfavor acted like a tonic on Diddy , crystallizing the muddle inside his head . Unlike yesterday , when sitting at the oval table was a continual eerie struggle . Today Diddy able to keep his mind on his work . So much so that after a heated argument on discount policies in which Diddy eloquently championed the unpopular position and finally brought a majority around to his view , he passed on to lunch in the cafeteria on the second floor without looking at his watch . Not until he was spooning out a second helping of creamed chicken did Diddy notice the time . Already ten minutes to two . So there had n't been a real decision . Instead Diddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Before Diddy can get from here to the funeral home , Mrs. Incardona and son will be on their way to the cemetery ; or already there , flinging earth on the coffin . Diddy horrifiedreviles himself for his absence of mind . ( Now ) he ca n't eat another mouthful . The chicken looks like boiled mucus . The morning'sperformance of bright , hard-headed , friendly , energetic , slightly priggish Dalton Harron before his colleagues seems grotesque(now) ; inexcusable even as a performance , even as the skillful play-acting of a man with better concerns to occupy his mind . Who is he to be detached at this moment ? Immediately hep108thinks of Hester . Diddy wo n't alter his decision not to visit her tonight . That , added to his failure even to remember the funeral , would complete the exhibit of his enfeebled will . But before the coffee comes , he will phone the hospital to inquire how she is . That evening , he sets himself a small penance . An evening alone . No distracting dinner with Jim or any of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , and use his mind for a change . Make unadulterated contact with the inner man . A task he 's been neglecting ; for which he 's ( now ) paying the price . Nothingseems to have the right weight any more . He 's being lightheartedabout the serious , solemn about the casual . Diddy the Dunce . He must try to think . Not worry , fret , or castigate himself . But think . Even though it 's not easy to be alone . He worries that Hester may be expecting him although he 'd spoken with her at two o'clock  --  they 've installed the phone in her room  --  and told her he was n't coming this evening . Without making any excuses . But it pains him to imagine her there , swathed in her homely nightgown , sightless and unable to move , pinned down under the barrage of her aunt 's endless chatter . He 'd call her ( now ) if he had n't found it hard to talk on the phone this afternoon . Better wait until they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him . Why had n't he thought of it earlier ? Though he failed to attend the funeral , he can still find out about it . If he calls the Floral Gardens claiming to be on the magazine of the incredibly named Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way , he can inquire about Incardona 's funeral without arousing any suspicions . And if he still wants to , it should n't be difficult to see the widow and the boy on some similar pretext . Hello . Floral Gardens . Diddy gives a fictitious name , identifies himself as a reporter for the union 's magazine . " Got almost the whole Incardona story written , " Diddy says cautiously , " but I need a little more information . " The man on the other end said he 'd help if he could . " Let 's see . Oh , yes , I 've got to know "  --  Diddy trying to ask something innocuous  --  " what cemetery the guy was buried in. "  | " You got it all wrong . He was n't buried at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And where are . . . where have the ashes been de-posited ? " " They were sent to his mother , who lives , let me see , in Texas . Yeah , that 's it . Request of the deceased . It 's all in the will . " Diddy so shocked at this news that he could n't utter another word , let alone ask another question . Remaining silent , trying to force his sluggish mind to absorb what he 's heard . " Anything else you want to know , Mr. Douglas ? " " Oh , yes . . . yes , " said Diddy . " I mean , no , I do n't think so . No . . . . Yes , I just wondered if the . . . ashes had already been sent off . " " Shipped late this afternoon , first-class airmail , special delivery , registered and insured . I do n't mind telling you Uncle Sam 's post office collects a pretty penny on freight like this . Floral Gardens do n't make nothing on it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's not too expensive , though . " Diddy finds he simply can not go on talking or listening , thanks the man . Hangs up . Why does the fact that Incardona was cremated rather than buried so appall and alarm Diddy ? Because it seems to throw the workman back again into the realm of phantoms . A corpse lowered into the earth and left to rot is a real thing . Still resembling what it once was : a dense , bulky animal body . That remains intact for a considerable time . Even a body as mutilated as Incardona 's presumablywas would be worth digging up for many months , even years to come ; could still be submitted to an autopsy that would establish the fact of the murder . But cremation ! Ashes are nothing at all . No body , no weight . Nothing to exhume . Nothing that can be linked to the living person , nothing to examine . Diddy has let matters get out of hand . Something mysterious going on . Why should Incardona have wanted to be cremated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a will , but maybe he was misinformed . Would n't someone named Incardonabe a Catholic , whose church prohibits cremation ? Maybe the man at the funeral home  --  the undertaker 's assistant ?  --  was lying.  |p110Or  in ignorance of the truth . Perhaps it was the New York , Boston &; Standard that wished the body disposed of in this irrevocable way . Or even Incardona 's wife . Something they or she wanted to hide , which an extant corpse might reveal ? Suppose the telephone voice was n't lying or misinformed . Still peculiar for a youngish laborer with only a high-school education to have drawn up a will . Unless Incardona had some presentiment of an early death . And cremation seems particularly implausible . Where would a lout like Incardona have gotten such an affected notion about the disposal of his body after death ? No doubt any longer in Diddy 's baffled mind that he ca n't leave things as they stand , trusting telephone voices and misleadingly headlined newspaper stories . Diddy the Gullible will have to do some investigating of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the crew of the train , as many fellow passengers as can be traced . A number of interviews will be needed just to straighten out what happened , leaving Diddy still nowhere near the precise reckoning of guilt and innocence . But it 's a beginning . Diddy 's agitation starting to subside ( now ) . A glimpse of the sense of mastery . Is it frustration that 's making him feel more active , less inert ? What 's sure is that Diddy does feel intensely frustrated by this latest news . For all his waverings about going to the police , he 'd always expected that , eventually , an inquiry into Incardona 's death would take place ; for such an inquiry an intact body , or semblance thereof , is required . So assumed that Incardona 's funeral would be the usual interment . Must be . The workman 's body being stored away . Kept against future use , some use . Some day , if not ( now ) or soon , they were bound to hold an autopsy . He 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fecal smell of the autopsy room . A long steel table . Metal cabinets with glass shelves filled with rows of stoppered bottles , labeled in purple ink , containing remnants and trophies of tissue adrift in Forrnalin . The bullet-riddled organs of several notorious criminals cut down in gang wars . Body fragments from famous airplane crashes of the last decade . Rows of larynxes , cross-sectioned to revealthe gimmicks of death : a shrimp , a thumbtack , a piece of steak , a half dollar . Rows of embryos in every stage of develop/ment . Poisoned brains , narcotized nervous systems , tranquilized hearts , gassed lungs , ground-glass ruptured linings of stomachs . Diddy is waiting . A Negro in white jacket and pants , reeking of vomit , brings in a body on a wheeled stretcher and pulls off the blanket . Four men are waiting , the Chief Medical Examiner and three deputies . The chief slips on his tight translucent brown rubbergloves , takes up a bright metal tool , makes one incision the length of Incardona 's torso , from clavicle to pubis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Now ) he has put down the tool and stands with hands plunged in the cadaver 's innards , gaze politely averted . The others watch attentively . Any death which is sudden , unattended by a doctor or medicallyunsupervised ; any death which is traumatic ; any death which is at all suspicious , must be investigated by the coroner 's office . Is n't that the law ? Please continue the examination . Please look . Why do n't you look ? Do n't rush to designate " no case . " In New York City , Diddy knows , the coroner 's office is also required to certify all requests for cremation . Had an autopsy already been performed on Incardona ? But perhaps there 's no such rule in this city . Just as in many cities a coroner does n't even have to be an M.D.An experienced public coroner , it 's said , works intuitively . He can smell a homicide . Also a question of reasoning , correct reasoning . A coroner ought to be a skilled pathologist , backed up by six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ X ray , microphysics , and toxicology . But there 's so much evidence , more than one can handle . An autopsy may uncover several possible causes of death . Besides the damage done by Diddy 's cowardly blow , besidesbeing trampled by the Privateer , Incardona may have had a bad heart , cirrhosis of the liver , an undiagnosed ulcer , syphilis . Which one is responsible ? Maybe the death looks like foul play , and was n't . Or maybe it does n't , and was . If someone is hit by a train , whose fault is it ? Everyone agrees that one ca n't bring charges against the iron monster , which has only done its job , behaved exactly as it was designed to behave , speeding forward along the tracks on its lethal wheels . But then people often talk about themselves in a similar way , as if they were designed orp112made to order ; their line of self-exoneration the same , too . Is the chief engineer in some remote way culpable ? Or any member of the train 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then apprehending the murderer , if indeed the death is a murder , other issues are at stake . The amount of the insurance and the money from workmen 's compensation going to the widow and fatherless boy will vary according to the manner of Incardona 's death . Not to speak of a more general matter : the detection of any failure in the safety procedures set up by the railroad to protect its workers . Murder stinks . That 's the clue . Out of what inappropriate delicacydoes the coroner avert his gaze ? Is n't he thoroughly hardened to the horrors of his profession ? If anyone is capable of fearless vision , it would be such a man . But it hurts to look . Incardona lies with his head thrown back . His body is split open , and all his organs carefully scooped out . The flesh of his torso hangs over the sides of the metal table in two brownish flaps , exposing his spinal column from neck to pelvis . The coroner wields his flashing knives ... . Late Wednesday afternoon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A brief visit before embarking upon his evening 's sleuthing . He comes empty-handed . Being too impatient to buy anything but an unconsidered hasty bouquet at the florist 's in the hospital lobby ; not knowing what , other than flowers , to bring . Happily , Mrs. Nayburn 's not there . As he comes in , Hester raises her head . Can she see anything from behind the dark glasses ? And what manner of distasteful , impersonal tests have the doctors been subjecting her to ? She seems all patience , but surely that 's deceptive . Like him , she must be either vibrating with hope or stilled with despair . He tosses his coat over the chair at the foot of the bed . " Do n't say . I know it 's you , " says Hester . She smiles . Diddyp113happy ( now ) . Quickly comes over to embrace her ; then sits close in the other chair , moving it against the frame of the bed . Clasps her left hand in his ; with his right hand , reaches up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her mouth , kisses his fingers . He bends over to kiss her hair and mouth . The dialogue of intimacy sustained , even when they begin to talk . Hester seems less guarded and enigmatic . Sitting upright ( now ) ; knees bent and drawn together , her spine curved like a bow . They are holding something like an ordinary conversation , the kind Diddy often finds insufferable , but which he finds soothing , reassuring ( now ) . He sketches the history of Watkins &; Company ; outlines the company 's present situation , borrowing from Jim 's view as well as giving his own ; describes the physical plant ; conjures up the first three days of this week 's conference , both text and sub-text , tedious round-table discussions and barely audible politicking . What could Hester find engrossing in the fumbling fortunesof the firm , in the genteel drudgery of Diddy 's job ? In a controversial memorandum on standards ofcraftsmanship drawn up by industry spokesmen and circulatedat this morning 's meeting ? In the third-quarter statement ? In the antics of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new government contract jubilantly disclosed by Reager yesterday  --  the thought of which is haunting Diddy  --  for special instruments to be used in the Army 's biological warfare laboratories ? In Watkins ' latest feud with Reager ? In the mishandling of the sale of thirty Scope 21 's to the University of Lima ? But even if Hester is only humoring him by listening so well , by acting interested , he 's warmed by her graciousness . By her desire to please . Diddy wishes that what 's scheduled for tonight after he leaves the hospital were n't happening tonight ; because it 's preventinghim from being wholly present with Hester this afternoon . Open to her , nourished by her . Diddy trying to be in this room only , but he ca n't . He 's already rehearsing in some remote bastion of his mind how he will enter the next space.  |p114It  's almost six . " Did you come earlier because you have an appointment this evening ? " Diddy , found out . It seems impossible ever to conceal from Hester the diluting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " Business ? " " No . A personal matter . It 's someone I 've never met before . " By giving such an answer , mysterious yet informative , does n't Diddy invite Hester to question him further ? Is that what he wants ? Yes . Then is he disappointed when , quite firmly and noticeably , no more questions are asked ? Diddy starting to feel uncomfortable . The redundant white of the hospital room is imprisoning ; stillness and immobility reside here , while Diddy knows himself to be free . He has permission to leave , does n't he ? A body suitably clothed to appear on the street , eyes to see where he is going . Whereas this room is static , a private cell , the arsenal of mortality . Monday 's flowers know : they 're beginning to languish . Can Hester sense his flowers ' drooping , minuscule crawl toward death ? When does death become perceptible ? How far along toward death do flowers have to travel before their odor fades , their flesh stiffens and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o'clock . Hester must feel Diddy stirring restlessly in the white Leatherette chair , must understand the token plaint of his sweating palm in hers . But does she know exactly how edgy and upset he is ? In all respects ? Because she ca n't see him , she ca n't observe that his uncertainty about how to conduct himself later this evening is mirrored in an untypical confusion in his clothes . Diddy is wearing the wrong tie for that shirt , the wrong shirt for that jacket , the wrong shoes for those trousers . Except for mismatched socks , a sample of almost every conceivable sartorial error . Nothingfelt right today . Lonely as well as evidently attached to him ( now ) , Hester wants him to stay on . Diddy does n't mean to arouse further marks of affection on her part by his uncontrollable detachment tonight . Not the kind of man who 'd try manipulating a woman he desires by playing cool . The attraction Diddy feels to Hester is something he'dp115like to show . But this is n't the right time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's one that circumstances require deferring . Better to leave the hospital . Get on with it . Diddy is walking along a narrow mean street , holding a slip of paper with the address he 's copied from the newspaper clipping in his wallet ; past rows of nearly identical two-story frame houses . Like the houses seen out of train windows that one rejects , interiorsunseen , without ever inhabiting them . Stops before one of the houses , number 1836 . The right house ( now ) . A stocky buxom woman answers the doorbell . Wearing gold sandals , bell-bottom Op Art slacks , and a yellow sateen blouse ; cigarette in hand . " Mrs. Incardona ? " " Whatcha want ? " The woman plainly on her guard . From the hallway visible behind her , a gust of stale smoke and the smells of frying . " Myra Incardona ? " " What 's it to ya ? " " I 'm from the railroad . " Diddy removes the wrong hat . " I 'm sorry to bother you with more questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh . . . " The woman 's flabby cheeks swelled into a smile , flaunted a mouthful of bad teeth . " Come in . " She seems pleased . How many investigators have preceded him ? " Tommy ! " she shouts in another , raucous voice . " Shut off the goddamn TV . A man from the railroad is here . " Turning to Diddy : " Here , doncha want to take off your coat ? " Diddy surrenders coat and hat , which she drapes over the bannister of the uncarpeted staircase leading up to a second floor ; follows her into the overfurnished parlor . Clouded with smoke . The stench , identifiable as cigarettes , fish , and cooking oil , seems to trisect the air in layers . Across the room , down in the lower layer , fish , Diddy sees the boy kneeling before the dying image . If it 's true , as the Courier-Gazette reported , that he 's eleven , he seems small for his age . Certainly undersized , considering his parentage . " This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Say hello , Tommy . " The boy looks up briefly , then lowers his head without acknowledging Diddy , perhaps awaiting a sturdyp116phantam image that will miraculously reappear on the small-screen TV . " He should be in bed by now or doin ' his homework . You hear , Tommy ? " " Is the railroad going to give us some money , Mom ? " " My boy is very upset , Mr. Dalton . What with the funeral only yesterday . Do n't pay no attention . " " No . . . please , " says Diddy , flustered . The child does n't resemblehis father , at least not the man Diddy remembers . He 's puny , fair-skinned , freckled , with a long V-face and glittering lightbrowneyes . Incardona 's build was thick ; he had dark skin , a heavy squarish jaw , and black eyes and hair . His wife looks typically Scots-Irish and her eyes are light , though her hair , a garish copper hue , must be dyed ; one ca n't determine its true color . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhere a photograph of the dead husband and father . Covering a patch of the flowered wallpaper ? No . On the mantelpiece , with the souvenirs from the World 's Fair ? No . Not even on top of the TV , alongside the little plaster Child of Prague . " You can stay if you keep your mouth shut , " said the woman . She smiles at Diddy . " Sit down . " She points , with a **25;8136;TOOLONG , at the low table in front of Diddy . " Hey , how about some strawberry ice cream ? I got some out in the icebox . " Diddy shook his head . " Sure ? All right . Now what can I do forya ? " The woman 's amiability is unnerving Diddy . He wants to turn and run . But there are questions to be asked . And Diddy , cautious Diddy , must be tactful . " Well , " he began . " As you know , we 're completing our investigation . I 'm afraid I have to ask you a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy . The gross light of understanding widens the woman 's face . " Tommy , go to bed . " " Aw , Mom ... " " You heard me . Get . " The boy slouches out of the room , scuffling his feet and punchingone of the chairs he passes.  | " That boy ! " Mrs. Incardona sits down heavily . " He 'll be the death of me yet . " Diddy finding it hard to continue . Something in the woman 's tone , voice , language is unpleasantly familiar . Could he have met her before ? " Mrs. Incardona , I know your husband had irregular hours and worked a good deal out of town . Did you see him often ? I mean , when he was n't working ? " Why was Diddy asking this ? To see if Incardona had really existed ? A last absurd hope . Maybe this redhead only imagined she was married to a railroad worker named Incardona ; in fact had n't seen him in years . " Well , Joe was n't exactly what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frantically . " Wait a minute ! What did you call your husband ? " Instant rebirth of hope . There 's been a mistake . He 's at the wrong house . " What ? " " Your husband 's name ! You called him Joe . But I . . . our recordshave him listed as Angelo . " A mistake . A mistake in Diddy 's favor ? No . " Oh , he never used that Eyetalian name . Only his ma calls him that . He said the boys razzed him bad enough as it was , ' cause it was on his punch card and his paycheck . We never called him nothin ' but Joe . Kinda short for Angelo , I guess . " " I see , " said Diddy , leaning back again , exhausted by his instant round trip of hope . " Excuse me for interrupting you . You were saying something before . " " What was I sayin ' , Mr. Dillon ? I ca n't keep nothin ' straight in my poor head these days . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were saying that your late husband was n't , you said , much of a homebody . " " Oh , yeah . That 's sure the truth . I guess no railroad man is . Else they would n't be workin ' for the railroad . Right ? Mr. uh ... " " Dalton . " Diddy scowled . It was true . The woman was terribly muddled . Could one believe anything she said ? Mrs. Incardona was insisting . " Am I right ? You tell me . " " I understand what you 're saying . " Diddy would not be bullied . " You asked me if he come home always when he was n't work/in ' . I guess you know he did n't . Sure , I knew what was goin ' on . Used to raise hell about it , too . But what can you do ? A man 's not like a woman . Know what I mean ? No two ways about that . " Diddy sighed . Incardona was real , even under another name . " Thanks for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why should n't I be ? Tell me that , Mr. Dillon . Where would it get me ? Joe 's gone , there 's no helpin ' that . Oh , I cried . Lemme tell you . You shouldda seen me at the funeral yesterday . But then I dried my eyes , and I said , Myra , you just pull yourself together . There 's no bringin ' Joe back , I says to myself . And that 's all there is to it . " Each time the woman said " Joe , " Diddy flinched . Knew well enough that many people use a name other than what 's on their birth certificate . Could the switch in this case be just that innocent , trite ? And what about the eerie familiarity of the woman 's voice and mannerisms , scarcely less of a shock than learning a new first name for Incardona ? " I cried , " repeated the woman . She was scrounging for a compliment . Weary Diddy would give it to her . " You have a great deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what Father McGuire said to me . He 's down at ImmaculateHeart . Myra , he said to me , Myra , you 're a brave woman . " " I 'm glad , " murmured Diddy , lost in something like thought . There was some very large woman far away or way back like Myra Incardona . But ( now ) very small . " Well , what was I supposed to do , Mr. Dillon ? I mean Dalton . Kill myself ? Not me ! I got a boy to raise . . . and , just between you and me and the lamppost , maybe it 's a bit of a blessing , Joe 's being taken from us like that . Though I hate to say it . " She leaned toward Diddy confidentially . Diddy took out a cigarette , stuck it between his lips , and lit a match ; his hand shook . Hoped the woman had failed to detect any trembling of the flame as it approachedhis jaw . " You know what I 'm tryin ' to say ? He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me dead if I 'm not tellin ' the truth . Just did n't seem to care about his family . Used to wallop the boy somethin ' awful with one of them wooden hangers . It just broke my heart . But I could n't stop him . Even when I tried . "  |p119Weary  Diddy realized that he had n't been listening to a word the woman uttered . His mind gone blank as a TV screen after the end of the broadcasting day : a flickering glassy gray-white wall , exuding a faint hum . He must force himself to replay the woman 's last words inside his head , to use his mind , to make a connection . Think of what she 's just said . Her admission that she 'd disliked her husband . A motive perhaps ; explaining why the workman had been cremated . Nobody hiding or concealing anything . A simple act of revenge . By the embittered wife . Just being dead is n't enough . To get rid of him really , once and for all . But Diddy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know how to go about determining the truth of his newest supposition . She 'd been staring at him . It could n't be at his clothes , could it ? Why is Diddy finding it so hard ( now ) to talk ? " Sure you do n't want some ice cream ? It 's awful good . " Is she trying to put him at his ease ? Make him feel more at home ? " No thanks . " Diddy taking a deep drag on the cigarette . He 'll fight this lethargy . " Mrs. Incardona "  --  Diddy has decided to move boldly  --  " I was wondering why your husband was cremated . That 's a little unusual , is n't it ? " " Oh , Blessed Saint Peter and Paul ! " The woman threw up her hands . " Mr. Dillon , do n't remind me of that ! Joe put it in his will , that 's why . I did n't have nothin ' to do with it . Can you see me gettin ' mixed up with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' out good money for nothin ' ? I mean , where does all that fuss and fancy stuff get ya ? Just showin ' off , that 's all . But when it 's over you 're still just as dead . Now I know when I go , I do n't care what they do with me . Put me out on the street with the garbage , for all I care . Am I right ? " Is she telling the truth ? Then what happens to Diddy 's latest theory ? " But your husband did have a preference , " he said , trying to steer Myra Incardona back to the main line of thought . " He wanted to be cremated . " " Who knows what he wanted . You never could get a straight word out of Joe . Say one thing one minute , somethin ' else the next . He 'd do it just to get my goat . Then he 'd laugh . " Diddy exasperated . " But cremation was mentioned in his will ? "  | " Sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to myself , it 's just like Joe , I says . The man always was a damn fool , him and his brother . Why , he could of been buried real cheap in the Arlington National Cemetery , with a flag on his coffin and all . Joe had that comin ' to him , you know . Bein ' as he was a veteran . " What 's this about a brother ? Another railroad worker named Incardona ? Dead or alive ? But Diddy must resist getting sidetracked . If he 's not careful , his mind will spill all over the place , like Myra Incardona 's ; seduced by every passing phrase and its associations . What was it she 'd said ( now ) ? Oh , yes . " Then why do you suppose your husband preferred to be cremated ? " Diddy asked . " It seems odd . " " Are you tellin ' me ? Odd ai n't the word for it . Plain crazy I call it . Why , when I heard what was in Joe 's will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get ' em to change it , but they would n't . Said I could n't go against the will , like it was sacred or somethin ' . I think he put that in just to upset me . Spite , that 's all it was . He knew it 'd upset me because crematin ' is against the Church . " Looking at Diddy , as if she expected some answer ( now ) . " But maybe you do n't know about the faith . You ai n't a Catholic , are ya , Mr. Dalton ? " " No , " said Diddy , " Protestant . " " Well , that 's all right , " the woman said . " There 's good and bad in all races , and I do n't hold with lotsa people I know who think Catholics are the only good people and everybody else is goin ' straight to hell . I wancha to know that . " " I 'm glad , " said Diddy . Loosened his tie , unbuttoning his collar . " Say , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " How 's about adrink ? I sure could use one . " " Please go ahead , " said Diddy . " But nothing for me . " The woman got up from the chair , and left the room . Returning in a minute with two cans of Rheingold , two glasses with naked mermaids on them , and an opener . Setting them down on the low , lacquered table . Diddy the Gentleman took over ; opened one can . " What I was sayin ' before , " the woman spoke slowly , watching him pour half the can into a glass , " about un-Catholics goin ' to hell . Seems kinda mean to say that , do n't it ? But I guess I do be/lieve in it . I ca n't help it . That 's the teaching of the Church . I learned it in school from the sisters forgot nothin ' they taught me . They were strict , all right ! But whatever they learned you , you learned good . And if you were a smart aleck and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' notes in class , then you really learned somethin ' . Somethin ' you never forgot . Why , I used to come home from school with my rear end red as fire ! " She laughed . " Excuse me for talkin ' this way , Mr. Dillon  --  " For a moment , chuckling too hard to go on . " Yeah , they could of used me for a bed warmer , that 's how red and hot my little fanny was . " More laughing . Then a sullen look . " But , you know , it ai n't like that any more . Kids have it easy nowadays . Right ? My Tommy goes to a school run by the sisters , but they never hit him and they do n't give him half the homework they gave me . Last week he  --  " " Mrs. Incardona , you were telling me about your husband 's will and the cremation . " " Oh , sure , I 'm getting ' to it . " Pouring the rest of the can into her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took him to a place down near the train depot , but they told me I hadda make some other arrangement Monday morning . I went down there , but they would n't lemme see the body and I did n't wan na , see ? " She paused . Diddy nodded . " It 's my nerves , see . My nerves ai n't so good some-times . " Diddy waiting for her to go on . Is that the end of the story ? " Sure you do n't wan na beer ? " Diddy shook his head . " Well , I guess I ca n't let it go to waste . " She grinned . Diddy opened the other can , poured it . " What happened after they would n't let you see the body ? " " Well then I came back home and by this time , it was late Sundaynight , there was a lotta people here , relatives of Joe and me and friends , drinkin ' and cryin ' , mostly drinkin ' , and we opened the will . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was wrong , so right away I hightailed it to the phone upstairs and called Father McGuire . That 's what I did , even though it was past midnight and I had a bit of a load on myself , ya know , fromp122cryin ' and feelin ' so bad . Anyway , when I told Father McGuire about it he said I oughtta ignore the will and just get Joe to a proper Catholic funeral home like Donoghue 's across from the church and he 'd take care of the rest . But then Joe 's brother Charlie , he 's got one of those Eyetalian names but we call him Charlie , come bustin ' in here about three in the morning . They just got a new Pontiac . And he drove all the way from Waltham Massachusetts which is where he lives . I 'd called him around nine to tell him about Joe 's accident , I mean I had to do that , but he never told me he was gon na come right away . But he has this big new car , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he has a real big thing against the Church , how the sisters hit him with a ruler all the time when he was a kid in school because he was a lefty and how the priests was always after him and upsettin ' him and givin ' him nightmares and what a lousy childhood he and Joe had . " The woman leaned back . Drinking up the beer ; some of it dribblesdown one corner of her mouth . Is this the end of the story ? It 's getting harder for Diddy to tell . " Cigarette ? " he said , extending the pack across the table . " Thanks . Do n't mind if I do . " She leaned way across the table to get a light from Diddy ; who 'd also taken out a cigarette for himself . A good thing he had n't drunk the beer , feeling as tired as he does . " Where was I ? " So there is more . " About the awful childhood your husband and his brother had . " " Aw , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . He 's just a big talker . Got a chip on his shoulder . Now take Joe , for instance . Joe was different . He did n't hold a grudge like that about the Church and he did n't go mopin ' about what a miserable kid he was , and I bet he got hit just as much as Charlie . But Joe liked to always look on the bright side of things . " She smiled broadly at Diddy ; briefly , she looked graceful and almost generous . Twirling the long string of purple beads she wore over the yellow blouse , her eyes periodically resting on his . Diddy felt the room getting smaller and smaller , and Myra Incardonacommensurately larger . Despite a separation between themp123of some four feet , staked out by the low , oval table between the pair of identical high-backed easy chairs , he 's as aware of her flesh as if she 'd been sitting in his lap . Loose , thick , pungent flesh . For at least several minutes ( now ) , parts of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her breasts , her pudgy hands , the gold fillings that showed every time she laughed , the dark brown roots of her copper hair . Diddy the Disconcerted . Assaulted by disconnected sensations . As if there 's something wrong with his eyes , his skin . He needs a buffer  --  a slab of hard , featureless , impersonal material to hold between himself and this oozing , prattling woman . Well , he does n't have to look at her when he 's talking . Only Diddy 's losing the thread again . Must painstakingly reconstruct where they are ( now ) in this conversation . Myra Incardona may get lost , and not care . But Diddy cares . Imperative to stick to facts . A fact : Angelo  --  Joe  --  Incardona did n't mind having had an unhappy childhood . " But your husband 's brother felt differently , is that right ? " Diddy continued aloud . " Charlie ? I 'll say ! You should hear him , Mr. Dillon . He 's got a wicked tongue . People sure think twice before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right in understanding , Mrs. Incardona , that you let your brother-in-law make the arrangements for the funeral ? That after he arrived , he took care of everything ? " " Well , when Charlie come right out Sunday night and offers to pay for everythin ' I could n't argue , could I ? I mean about the cremation . It was his money , see . Though I got ta admit I never thought he 'd come through and offer . He and Joe was n't all that close . I mean , seem ' they was brothers . When he first said he 'd do it , I razzed him for bein ' an old souse . I guess I 'd had a few myself . It was an awful long evenin ' . " " You said your brother-in-law lives in Massachusetts . What kindof work does he do ? " Diddy , suddenly aware that he sounds likeprying , fatuous Mrs. Nayburn on the train ; but it ca n't be helped . This is an emergency , and no time to be fastidious about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Myra Incardonalooked less mammoth in size . Empty words have their use after all . " He 's a bricklayer . They make good money , bricklayers , didp124ya know that , Mr. Dillon ? See , their union fixes it so that in cold weather they  --  " Diddy intervened faster this time . " Then if it had been up to you , Mrs. Incardona , you would have had your husband buried in a casket , in consecrated ground , with all the rites of the Church . Is that right ? " Diddy had to interrupt , because he is feeling faint . Did n't speak in order to know anything . To this question  --  and by ( now ) , to many more  --  Diddy already knew what answer the woman would make . No solutions to his enigmas here . Each promisinglead destined to be quickly overthrown . " Say , what are you gettin ' at ? " said the woman . In an unpleasant tone that startles Diddy , who had been getting used to the inexhaustibleflaccid genial one . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been buried proper , if he wanted to ? I know what you 're trying ' to do . Put words in my mouth . It 's because of that goddam newspaperstory , where it says that somebody from your fuckin ' railroad said that Joe mightta killed himself . Of all the nerve ! There 's a law against sayin ' things like that , you know ? I bet I could sue that paper for a hundred thousand bucks for slandering my poor dead Joe . And the railroad , too . My Joe was a good Catholic , so how the hell could he of done somethin ' like that ? " Diddy had tried to interrupt this tirade several times , without success . The woman had stopped ( now ) , set in her indignant look . " Mrs. Incardona , you 're just wasting your anger . I can understandyour feelings about what was in the newspaper story , but that was n't at all the point of my question . Honestly . All I 'm trying to get straight is how your husband came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , straight question . I asked whether , if it had been up to you , you would have preferred to have your husband buried , in the way Catholics ordinarily are . " But she still does n't like that question . " Listen , Mr. Dillon ! " The woman crossed her arms and looked peeved . " I got a feelin ' you do n't understand somethin ' . Now I was educated by the sisters , God bless ' em , and I been a Catholic all my life and I 'm gon na die a Catholic . And if my Tommy ever comes home and tells me he wants to marry an un-Catholic girl , I 'll whale that kid within an inch of his life . He wo n't know what hit him when I  --  "  | " Look , " Diddy interrupted again , " I just need to know about the circumstances of your husband 's funeral . " " Well , what d' you think I 'm telling you , " she exclaimed sourly . " Do n't be in such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Incardona , I appreciate your hospitality and your honesty . But I do have a job to do . " " I know , I know , " she sighed . " You work for the railroad . Just wait a minute , I wan na get another beer . Sure you wo n't have one with me ? Okay . " Diddy leaned back in his chair while she was out of the room , closed his eyes . Myra Incardona 's returning footsteps . " Listen , " she said , settling in the chair again , " I wan na get somethingstraight . You come in here and ask me a lotta questions and I do n't act formal or anythin ' , and seein ' as I got nothin ' better to do I 'm talkin ' to you . But one thing I wancha t'know is that every word outa my mouth , every last word , is the God 's honest truth , so help me God . Are you with me ? " Diddy nodded sleepily . " About this whole goddamn cremation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , though why the railroad should care what happened to what was left of poor Joe I 'll be damned if I can figure out . You wan na know if I was for or against it . Or maybe why I did n't stop it . But I 'm not tellin ' you , though you 're a perfectstranger to me , any different from what I told Father McGuire down at Immaculate Heart today . You know that man had the nerve to start bawlin ' the daylights out of me , just this afternoon ? And what for ? I 'll tell ya . For lettin ' Joe be cremated . He told me that Joe 's soul would rot in Purgatory forever and that he would n't be able to rise up at the Last Judgment and lotsa spooky stuff like that . Trying to make me feel bad . Like I done somethin ' awful to Joe . " " I 'm sorry , " Diddy said . He really was . Myra did n't even seem to hear Diddy 's words , but sailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I says , beggin ' your pardon , Father , but you 've got no right to talk to me like that . I did n't have no control over that funeral , I told him . Charlie 's the one , and if you want to tell somebody off and make ' em feel bad , you get ahold of Charlie . Boy , " she laughed , " would I like to see that ! Charlie 'd make mincemeat out of him . But Charlie 's gone back top126Massachusetts already . So I had to handle him all by my lonesome . And I did . Father McGuire is a young priest , see , and when they have n't been long out of the seminary they get ideas . He 's sort of serious , takes everything very hard , know what I mean ? A little wet behind the ears . But I set him straight . He understands now . " Diddy sighed . Talking with this woman was like drowning . Just a bit more , then he 'd leave and maybe go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight in his mind about Incardona and his family . For example , the situation between the brothers . Diddy sent up a probe . " How would you describe your husband 's attitude toward the Church ? " " Say , can I have another cig ? The brand I smoke is lousy . Thanks . . . Now what was that you said ? . . . Oh , about Joe .. . Well , he had his gripes , you know . Like Charlie . Joe could go on somethin ' awful when he wanted to . He was always talkin ' against the Church , makin ' fun of me and Tommy goin ' to mass every Sunday regular as rain , while he lay around the house in his underwearswilling beer or gin , yellin ' , cursin ' , carryin ' on . " There 's the Incardona Diddy met . Things beginning to fall into place . " Was he . . . Mr. Incardona ... a very violent man ? " " Not what you call violent . But sort of mean , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' about what he did to me . I can take care of myself if I have to . But Tommy is somethin ' else . I told you that . Joe never did fancy kids much , though you 'd think he 'd like his own boy , would n't you ? But he and Tommy never hit it off . " " Was Tommy afraid of him ? " " That little fellow ? Not on your life . Stand right up to him , he did , big as life . How many times I seen it  --  Joe talon ' off his belt to wallop the daylights out of Tommy for somethin '  --  the kid 's got a lot of the devil in him , but he does n't mean no harm . And Tommy , full of spunk , sayin ' , Go ahead , Pop . You dish it out and I can take it . " " Did he really say that ? " said Diddy enviously . " Well , not just those words . Tommy 's got a temper , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd call Joe some pretty dirty names . Theyp127made me laugh , but Joe did n't like ' em . " She laughed , brought the beer can to her lips . " Oh . . . " More vividly than before , Diddy envisaged the family in its squalid smoky nest . Grouped in a snapshot pose : the big brutal father , the sexy slob of a mother , the harum-scarum kid . All changed , because of him . But he 's getting lost ( now ) in sentiment , in subjective guilt . That is n't why he came . It was to affix objective guilt and innocence if he could ; and incidentally to find out what had prompted the cremation . Forget about that . The conversion of Angelo Incardona into ashes had , apparently , no more than a trivial significance for his family . Though , to Diddy , it seemed a terrible , frustrating judgment . Among other things , an invitation to amnesia . Diddy must not allow Incardona 's reality to become flimsy , dubious . The workman existed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body had been miniaturized and dissipated . " Hey ! " It was Myra Incardona waving her hand in Diddy 's face . " Boy , you were really off on Cloud Nine that time . I thought you was in such a terrible hurry . Remember ? When you could n't wait to ask me questions ? " Is the woman starting to have doubts about who he is ? " I am in sort of a hurry , " Diddy said . " It 's my job . I have to make one more call this evening , and then go home and write some reports before I can get to sleep . " Myra Incardona did n't seem to be listening to much of what Diddy was saying , either . Probably catches about one word in three , and makes up the rest in her own head . All she seemed to have heard of his generous florid lie was the bare word : job . " I know you got a job , " she began , with a slack half-smile . " You work for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'll tell ya one thing . You sure do n't look like anybodyI ever seen who held down a job with the railroad . The clothes you got on are too smart . Your pants ai n't cut wide , like the way railroad men wear ' em . And I never saw a railroad man wear a nifty tie like that . Now that I take a good look at you , you look to me like somethin ' in an ad or somethin ' . And your face . Ip128can see you never had acne when you was a kid . Why , I can tell a lot just from the way a man shaves himself . " She paused . " You 're a real good-lookin ' guy . Here 's to you . " The woman saluted Diddy with her beer can . " Good lookin ' . D' you know that ? " Diddy shrugged his shoulders . Suddenly realizing what was going on : all that beer she 's washed down beginning to take effect . He 'd better clear out fast before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Myra can tell . " Her speech was becoming slurred , her head looked unsteady on her shoulders . " I 'll bet lotsa girls have told you that . So it probably do n't mean nothin ' to you when an old bag that 's pushin ' forty tells you . Is n't that right ? " Diddy has decided not to answer . Concentrated on summoning the energy to rise from the chair , and get from there to the front door . Out of this house . But meanwhile Myra Incardona 's wanderinglibido has settled , who knows for how long  --  a matter of seconds ? months ?  --  into friendlier , less pointedly seductive behavior . Endowed with more energy than Diddy . He 's only thinking of gettingup ; she has already darted out of the room again . Getting still more to drink ? Probably from the kitchen , calling , " Say , what 's your name ? Your first name , I mean . I keep gettin ' mixed up on your last one . " " Paul . " " Whad'ya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice name . " The voice ( now ) is further away , though Diddy can just make out the words . " I used t'know a Paul . Paul Follet , his name was . Big fella , real strong . Lived near here . Ever know him ? " " No . " " Too bad . " Myra , with two more cans of beer , at the threshold of the parlor . " He was a swell guy . You might of liked him . " She sat down . " No , come to think of it , you would n't . " This time Diddy the Gentleman did n't take over . Myra using the opener herself ; drinking straight from the can . " How old are you , Paul ? " " Thirty-three . " " Thirty-three ? " She slapped her thigh . " You 're kiddin ' me ! Gee , you do n't look that old . You 're gettin ' gray , I can see that . But it 's comin ' in pretty even , and I always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face ai n't lined at all . You look , well , about twentyeight . " A rapid glance . " Yeah , I 'd say twenty-eight . " Putting the can of beer down ; looked Diddy over slowly . " Hey , " she grinned , " I got just the job for you . With them clothes and the way you talk and your face , you should n't be workin ' for the railroad . They 're a bunch of slobs . You should be in an insurance office or a bank . That 's the best idea , a bank . Or maybe , if you wanted to earn more dough , you could go to school nights and study for a CPA . " Diddy puzzled . Is the woman becoming suspicious of him , or is this part of a seduction ? Though his instincts tell him it 's probably the former , he ca n't decide . Why ca n't he decide ? Why does he just smile , inanely , affably ; as if nothing 's going on . Wait , something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had toppled from the rim of the ashtray onto the coffee table . " Well , to tell the truth , Mrs. Incardona , I do n't really work for the railroad  --  " " You do n't ? " she yelled and was on her feet without Diddy having seen her stand up . Diddy alarmed and mystified . " Then what the hell are you doin ' in my house ? Is this a gag or somethin ' ? If it is , mister , you 're gon na be right out on your ear before you can turn around ! " " Hey , hey , hey , " said Diddy . " Calm down , Mrs. Incardona , you did n't let me finish my sentence . I was about to explain that I actuallywork for an insurance company that investigates accident claims for the New York , Boston &; Standard . I was telling you , " he smiled feebly , " because you said I did n't look like a railroad man . That 's why . I 'm not . " " Whew , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair . " It 's a good thing I do n't have a bad heart . You sure had me scared for a moment . . . Paul ? Is that your name ? I thought you was some creep , gettin ' into my place under false pretenses . Like a burglar or what 's his name , you know who I mean ... the Boston Strangler . " Diddy laughed . For the first moment , enjoying himself in Incardona'shouse . All the lies he was telling had become so absurd and ironical they seemed on their way to becoming true . If only he were n't so uncontrollably sleepy.  |p130At  this moment , Myra Incardona is saying something about how she 'd spotted him right away , just by his clothes . " It 's that kooky tie , " she said . Diddy involuntarily glanced down at his tie . Something unusual about it ? Looks to Diddy quite ordinary and conservative . The woman was watching him . " Sure you do n't want some strawberry ice cream ? It 's still sittin ' out there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Or I could fix you a whisky and soda . There 's gin , too . And there 's a couple of bottles of Dago red stashed in the broom closet . Joe liked that stuff , but I know I 'm never gon na drink it up myself . " " No thanks . It 's nice of you , but I 'm just fine . I 'll be going in a few minutes . " " Well I du n no , " she said archly , leaning back in the chair and crossing her legs . " I never met a man yet who did n't like somethin ' nice . And there 's a lotta nice things around here . " She looked at Diddy quizzically . " But I can see you 're a very particular fella who ai n't satisfied by the first thing that comes along . Am I right ? " Diddy suddenly very tired . A prodigious wave of fatigue that seems to have knocked him down ; was pulling him under . " Right ? " she asked again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice . Feeling faint , overpowered . As if he 'd been drugged . Would it be a mistake , he was wondering , to ask Mrs. Incardona to let him lie down for a few minutes ? " You know , " Diddy said , " I do n't feel well all of a sudden . Would you mind if I took off my shoes and lay down over there on the sofa for a minute ? " She got to her feet . " Why sure , go right ahead . Maybe you ate somethin ' . " Diddy shook his head ; still did n't get up himself . " Want me to get you an Alka-Seltzer ? " Again Diddy said no . " I just have to lie down for a minute . I do n't want to put you to any trouble . Please do n't let it worry you , because I 'm sure it 's nothing . " The woman alongside him as Diddy reached the couch . " I 'm not worried . And you ai n't puttin ' me to no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ springs in that couch are shot and it ai n't really comfortable . Why doncha go upstairs to my room ' n lie down on thep131bed ? " She put her hand on Diddy 's sleeve as he sat on the edge of the couch ; unlacing his shoes . " It 's a whole lot quieter up there . You can rest for a while , long as you like . I 'll see that Tommy gets to bed . Then I 'll come see how you are and if there 's anythin ' I can do for you . " Diddy sitting ; looked up at her enormous face . As with a magnifyingglass saw the large pores in her nose , the badly applied rouge on her cheeks , the folds of flesh along her jaw , the creases on her neck . And the scary dead expression on her face  --  not at all the look of someone who wants to make love . Although he 's about to lie down ( now ) , perhaps that 's not what he wants . The feeling of faintness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) was nausea . Afraid he is going to throw up . And embarrassed that she would understand why . Perfectly true that the woman was atrocious . But she was also a human being ; probably , like most people , perishing from lack of being touched and being able to touch . Diddy wished he did n't find her so unattractive and oppressive . " I do n't think I want to lie down after all , " Diddy said firmly , and started lacing up his shoes again . " Hey , what 's the matter ? " " Nothing , " said Diddy . " It 's passed , that 's all . I told you it was n't anything . What I need now is fresh air . " Did n't have the kind of metallic resolve that would permit him to look Myra Incardonain the face at this moment ; a moment he knew she took to be one of rejection . Nor the hardness of heart to walk straight to the front door ( now ) and leave . " Are you goin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have one more cigarette . Let 's sit over there again . " Diddy suddenly angry with himself . For the last half hour he has almost forgotten why he 's here . Why ? Because Diddy has killed this woman 's husband . And because Diddy has to know how and in what sense he , Diddy , is guilty . Seated again in the pair of identical high-backed easy chairs . " I suppose there 's still some information you want , " said the womanp132sullenly . " But I do n't know if I feel like answering any more questions . Maybe you better come back another time . " Was there really anything more to ask ? Had n't Myra Incardona told Diddy all that could be of use to him ? True , she has n't resolvedDiddy 's contradictory view of himself  --  as guilty and as innocent , as the aggressor and as the victim . But at least the informationshe 's supplied has kept the possibility of choice alive ; prevented it from being closed down for lack of evidence on the other side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Diddy . In the light of the man 's consistently brutal character as revealed by his widow , Diddy can spare himself in the future the thought that Incardona could n't have meant him any real harm . Is an even more weighty exoneration possible ? Until this evening , Diddy had scarcely dared to think that possible . But perhaps he 's been too quick at self-condemning . Given the right kind of reliable information about Incardona 's character and habits , it 's possible that Diddy 's act could be construed as self-defense . Even without any witnesses to the act . With a start , Diddy realizes he has been staring at his trousered knees , but without seeing a thing ; has neither heard nor spoken a word . Looks up to find the woman 's eyes upon him , an opaque gaze that he ca n't decipher . " Say , do you want to ask me any more questions or not ? It 's gettin ' late and I ai n't got all evening to waste . " Diddy knows she 's bitter ( now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't make matters worse . His plan : to get Mr. Paul Dalton out of this smelly shabby house , reeking of staleness and brutality and self-deception , as quickly as he can . But , as long as he 's still here , has to play out his role of sleuth and impersonator , to build a dossier for the attorney who will defend Mr. Dalton Harron at his trial . " I believe there 's only one more question I was supposed to ask you . I saved it for last , I guess , because I thought you might take it the wrong way . Did your husband drink ? " The woman 's face changed , darkened . " Whad'ya mean ? " " I do n't mean just a beer now and then . Did he get drunk ? "  | " Are you tryin ' to prove that Joe was drunk on the job ? That that 's how he got killed ? Of all the low-down  --  " " Wait a minute , Mrs. Incardona . " It was vital to stave off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wo n't be able to come back another time , if he thinks of any more questions . Diddy held out his hand . " I 'm not trying to prove anything . I 'm just asking you some routine questions . " " And I 'm answerin ' them , ai n't I ? I 'm being cooperative , right ? You said so yourself . You know , I could sue you people . I could probably collect a million dollars for Joe 's death . I seen cases like this in the papers . Tommy and I would be sittin ' pretty for the rest of our lives . I 'd get the law on my side , and that crooked railroad of yours would just have to shell out , Mr. High and Mighty  --  " " Mrs. Incardona , please ! " The woman stood up , marched over to the TV set and turned it on . A glare of hate . " What time is it ? " " Mrs. Incardona , no one is criticizing your husband . All I wanted  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doorway . Could he have been just out of sight all along ? " Yeah , Mom ? " " Come back in here and watch your TV . I know it 's late . But Mr. Dillon do n't have nothin ' to say that you ca n't hear . Your dad was a fine man . I wancha to know that . I do n't care who knows it , I 'll stand up and tell the whole world . " The boy made a face at Diddy and strutted triumphantly across the creaking floorboards to his chair . When something that looked like Superman sprang to black-and-white life , biddy 's eyes kept wandering to the TV screen . It was hopeless with the woman . Diddy has n't meant to offend her . But he had . And she , believing in this Mr. Dalton from the railroad with his unspecified investigator 's powers , was probably regretting her indiscretions . Feeling rejected , anxious , and annoyed with herself ; she 'd then charged Diddy with saying something he should not have said . Understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to attack . Well , just because she wanted to be angry , Diddy does n't have to get angry in return . Widow Incardona was coarse and stupid , like her loutish husband . But Diddy 's sense of justice informs him that he is the stronger ,  |p134even  if he did n't feel strong ; and she the underdog , irate and potent as she was . She had been injured by Diddy , though she did n't know it . And if , as seemed likely , she had reason to worry over her future , her husband 's assassin had an obligation to assist her . " Mrs. Incardona , one last question . Did your husband carry life insurance ? Did he have any savings ? What I want to know is whether you have funds for the future , besides what you 'll get from the union . " " I know what you 're up to , you son of a bitch , " screamed the woman , flailing out with her hands and knocking the ashtray full of cigarette butts off the low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make out as we do n't need the rotten money we 're goin ' to collect from the railroad . Well , you listen , mister . My cousin 's a lawyer , and a pretty good one , too . And he told me yesterdaythat it do n't matter at all . Joe was killed in the line of duty , run over by one of your fuckin ' trains . You people are gon na pay and pay plenny . You 're gon na pay through the nose . " " We 'd better stop . I 've had enough of this , " said Diddy , feeling claustrophobic and nauseated . How could he ever have been attracted . . . He stood up to go , stepping over the tiny gray dump of butts , used matches , and ashes . The woman had already bolted out of the parlor ahead of him . Diddy turned to the boy , longing to voice ( now ) some of the things he would have liked to have said to him . Such as : Are you the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I 'm sorry . Such as : I want to give you and your mother some money . Diddy the Silent , looking . The boy stared back coolly , then reached to one of the dials of the TV and turned the volume way up . Diddy joined the red-faced woman in the hallway . She pushed his coat and hat at him , pulled open the door . " You may be sorry you 've acted this way , Mrs. Incardona . " " You 'll be sorry , mister , before I 'm through ! " Diddy was prepared for the slamming of the door behind him , but not for the emptiness in his gut when he reached the sidewalk . Dismayed that he had botched the meeting . He would have liked to have found a plausible pretext for offering the woman some money . Yet , from a purely selfish point of view , he 'd done all right . Prob/ably Diddy had learned all he could from the woman  --  assuming that she was as artless as she seemed ; and was telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that Incardona 's widow seemed to attachno special significance to the cremation . Yesterday evening , when he 'd learned about it by phoning Floral Gardens , Diddy had instantly figured that this provision could n't have been in the man 's will . Someone , the railroad or the police or the widow , must be covering up something . ( Now ) all that may be , seems likely to be , just fancy . Though such a wish on the part of a workman of Incardona 's background is eccentric , its authenticity ca n't be dismissedfor that reason . Confused Diddy must beware of seeing demons everywhere . That 's almost as bad as not seeing anything . Maybe worse . If he'snot careful , his brain will be fit for concocting only lurid hypotheses . Remembering that there is a world of lucid , explainable , calmly proceeding events . Just as there is a world of the tunnel . A world of opaque , blind , high-speed events shrinking and distending , withering and swelling without any apparent logic . But no , remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about ( now ) , the clear one : furnished with low voltages and ordinary lighting ; in which one can take at face value newspaper prose and shopping lists and sales figures ; in which people speak , if not politely , at least when they 're spoken to ; in which one may expect apartments and houses to be either clean and orderly or dirty and messy . Sure , there is some kind of portentous commentary on Diddy 's deed expressed in the workman 's cremation . But it 's he , Diddy , who finds it there ; having himself brought about Incardona 's death and therefore the premature fulfillment of Incardona 's whim . More generally . As a result of the violently oppressive hour just spent with Incardona 's widow , a sense of the reality of the entire situation has decidedly gained on Diddy . There seemed no cause , within the boundaries of reason , for Diddy to doubt the existence of the workman ; and his role in the man 's death . Nor hesitate to identify his workman with Incardona , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impression made by his wife and child . So Diddy 's visit has been a success after all . Unless he insists on learning something so unexpected that it confounds all his previous theories , throws his seasoned memories into disarray . Was that what Diddy wanted ? A surprise ? Confusion ? But if some objective had been achieved this evening , why is n't Diddy willing to return to his hotel ? It 's already eleven o'clock . And he has nowhere better to go . On Wednesday night in a smallishcity at this hour , the movies are about to let out , restaurants are closed , and the bars will be shutting down soon . He could stroll in the park , but that 's located on the other side of town , near the Museum of Science and Industry and the college . And maybe the park closes at midnight . Diddy might just walk back to the Rushland . It 's several miles to the center of town from where he is ( now ) ; which ought to satisfyhis desire to stay out longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find his way without asking help from anyone ; relying on his excellent sense of direction . Having walked about ten blocks ( now ) . Hardly anyone is out on the street  --  a few teenagers , some old men . The houses end , and Maplewood Boulevard becomes a shopping district , whose facilities indicate the low average income of the neighborhood residents : clothing stores and grocery stores , pawnshops , candy stores , liquor stores , appliance outlets whose windows are papered with signs . " No credit . " " No money down . " Most of the stores are protected by heavy iron grilles . Practically everything is closed , and what remains open is almost deserted . Except for one place at the end of the block ; red-and-green neon spells out SMALL 'S PLACE in vertical lettering , with a neon drawing of a cocktail glass superimposed over the " S " and the " P. " People going in and out . Diddy looks in the window , sees a bar that seems crowded for this neighborhood on a weekday evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now ) . Orders a double rye on the rocks . A thin blonde around thirty-five , wearing an earth-red sheath and matching shoes , is sitting on the stool next to him , chin cupped in the palm of her hand . She smiles at him over the polished tips of her nails , he smiles back mechanically . A few minutes later ,  |p139staring  into his drink , Diddy recalls her smile . Looks up to see if she 's still there , wanting to play his smile over again , with more conviction . She moves her hand farther up her face , cradling her forehead . " Anything wrong ? " She does n't seem surprised that Diddy has spoken . " No , I 'm tired . Maybe it 's the jukebox . It gets on my nerves after a while . " " Have you been here long ? " She looks at Diddy differently ( now ) . " What kind of question is that ? " " I do n't know . Forget it . Let me buy you a drink . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a second rye . They are n't talking . Diddy because he can think of only one thing to say next . So sure is he of what the woman 's response will be that he wants to think carefully , making sure he really wants to go off with her . Diddy silent , too , because the jukebox was playingsomething by the Beatles that he particularly likes . " Now what ? " said the woman , when he turned again to look at her . " You 're not a customer , are you ? You work here , right ? " " You expect me to say yes to that ? " she asked . " Do I look like a cop ? " " Maybe . How do I know what a cop looks like ? " " Tell the truth . " He offered her a cigarette . " You could be a cop . Though , I do n't know , you 're dressed funny for a cop . " She looked at all the wrong clothes . " You stick out in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misunderstood husband . " " I 'm not that , either . . . . Well , actually , I 'm an ex-husband . I was fired three years ago . " " Am I supposed to say I 'm sorry ? " " No , " said Diddy , putting his hand on her thigh . " Listen , are you free now ? " " Right now ? " " Yes , right now . " " I suppose you want to know if I have somewhere for us to go , right ? "  | " Do you ? " " I do n't know . " She took a compact from her bag  --  red satin , a lighter shade of red than the dress and shoes  --  and began powderingher nose . " Listen , " said Diddy , " I do n't want you to do anything you do n't feel like doing . Understand ? I 'm not drunk . You can say no , and I wo n't go away mad . " The woman closed her bag , swiveled on the stool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you 're on the level , I 'll cut the comedy . There 's a reason I 've been sitting here so long tonight . The drinks are cheap , but I 'm not . " " I figured that . Do n't worry . " " Okay , lover . It 's a deal . " " Sure you do n't want another martini ? " " No thanks . " Diddy paid for their drinks , and when he slid off the bar stool and first felt the wooden floor under his feet became somewhat unsteady . Though he could n't be drunk . What 's your name ? " Doris . " Mine 's Dalton . " Oh . " " Coat ? " said Diddy . " Over there . The suede . " Diddy retrieved the coat , helped her on with it . " So long , Angelo , " she called to the bartender . Diddy 's head felt swiftly unhinged at the jaw . Here was another Angelo , one who used his right name . No , better not look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't observed before . Once in the street , Diddy 's head clears a little . The woman slips her arm in his , and leads them four blocks down a side street to a three-story brownstone with a " Furnished Rooms " sign nailed to the door . " This what you expected ? " Diddy shrugged . " Come on , baby . Stop treating me like some kind of hick in reverse . " " You do n't like being kidded , huh ? " They were climbing the stairs ( now ) . " What do you mean ? " said Diddy . " I love it . I 'm just crazy about it . " Puts his hand on Doris ' behind and keeps it there the rest of the way up the stairs . " Sure , sure . I can see what you 're crazy about , lover . "  | " I 'm crazy about a lot of things , " said Diddy , grinning . Giving her ass a hearty squeeze . Standing still . She was unlocking the door of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shades down on the two windows , minimal furniture , walls of an indeterminate color . Years since they were last painted . " Well , here we are . What do you think of it ? Some dump , huh ? " " I do n't get you , baby , " said Diddy . " Why are you always asking me what I think of things ? What do you care what I think ? I 'm here , are n't I ? " The woman , taking off her coat . " Who says I care anything about what you think ? You must be off your rocker . " " But you do , baby . Do n't try to cover it up . " Diddy knowing he should n't pursue this line of talk . Doris is n't supposed to be a person . Get on with it . But he ca n't resist . " I do n't mean you care about me as me , " Diddy says . " You do n't know me . And maybe everything works better if you pretend not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think he 's not really looking at you . But I do see you , I ca n't help it . In the bar I noticedhow depressed you looked . And I noticed you seemed anxious as we were walking here , and that it got worse as we came up the stairs . And that 's why you asked me a couple of dopey questions . Is n't that so ? " The woman looked at him . Incredulity . The softness in her face , the light in her eyes . A flash of genuine contact . Diddy smiled , without touching her . Could that have been a mistake ? A misreading . Because , right after , her face tightened again . And when she smiles back , it was a professional smile ( now ) that did n't address Diddy at all . " Where do you come from ? " said the woman . Diddy saw what happened . Saw it born , live , and die . In less than a minute . Back in the dead world ( now ) . Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I know you 're not from around here . Are you from New York City ? " " Yes . " " I thought so . " She was straightening the bed . " You 're the quietp140type . That 's how I knew . There are a lot of quiet people in New York City . " Diddy laughed softly . Poor Doris , poor people . " Have you ever been to New York City ? " " A couple of visits . With an old boyfriend of mine . I never lived there . " " And you 'd like to ? " " Like to ? You bet ! Jesus , would I ever like to get out of this dump ! You would n't believe what comes into this room . A lot of pimply college boys begging you to make a man of them , and wop railroad workers who are so plastered they forget why they ever came up here . " " Then clear out of here . Why do n't you move ? " " Maybe I 'm scared of how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Diddy , leaning against the chest of drawers , watching this Doris begin to undress , reached out and took her in his arms . " You 'd do all right , Doris . " The woman turned out of his embrace . " Can we , uh ... " " Oh , settle about the money ? " " Yeah . You know how it is . I can trust you , lover , I can tell that . But I meet all kinds of men . . . " Diddy covered her mouth with his hand . " Do n't explain . Is thirty all right ? " " Is that all you have ? " " I could give you forty . " " Deal . " Takes the money out of his wallet and gives it to her . They moved onto the large bed , and Diddy set about peacefully making love to her . " Hey , you 're really ready , are n't you ? " are the last words she said , and those right at the beginning . From then on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Diddy wanted to ask if there were something which particularly gave her pleasure that she 'd like him to do . But his experience with prostitutes had been slight , mostly in Europe on his vacations , and he did n't know whether she might take his insistence on pleasing her , as well as himself , as an impertinence or an imposition . Well then , Diddy willp143please himself . It 's not that this Doris appears to mind , or even that she 's unappreciative . Only that she seems very far away . Diddy must draw her as close as possible , making her the right size . He must be here , and not in his head . Doris is here . As long as Diddy does n't let his mind stray to Hester 's full body and eager way of taking her pleasure , it 's enough . Even a kind of blessing . After making love , Diddy has no intention of falling asleep . He was lying on his back . The woman on her left side , her head resting on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If stillness and even breathing mean sleep , Doris is asleep . To move would be to wake her up . The room is dark : no flashing sulphuryellowlight , and the bed fully as comfortable as the one in the Rushland . Diddy can take a quick nap . No hurry . Only a synthetic home awaits him , a room inimical to his true comfort . Since there 's nowhere else he has to be , he might as well be here . A little longer . Diddy hugs the damp , sleeping woman closer to him . Mumbling something . He tries to catch the words . " In the door , " she says . " Do n't wait . " " Doris ? " An odd noise , a kind of groan . Diddy waits to hear more . Black silence ( now ) in the room . Feels something cool and wet on his chest , and realizes she must be drooling slightly between parted lips . As some people do when sleeping lightly . Joan and he often fell asleep like this after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chest . " Doris ? " Diddy closes his eyes . Soon after , he slept , deeper than he 'd intended , and fell into a poorly lit , claustrophobic dream . One of those dreams in which scenes are n't clearly articulated . Not staged . At least , what the dreamer is left with upon awakening is not an adequate scenario which indicates movement in space and supplies dialogue ; more a kind of summary . An unproduced dream . The theme is Diddy making decisions , in dim light and in indistinctsurroundings . It started with feelings , wishes , resolutions , all the fruits of the will . Then , in order to give Diddy 's feelings the necessary lifelikeness , the background was hastily assembled or sketched in.  |p142Decision  first . Diddy had decided he would marry Myra Incardonaand become Tommy 's stepfather . Where had he proposed to the widow ? In the front hallway of her small home , it seemed . But that was n't clear . Maybe an afterthought . Next came the wedding , which took place in a Catholic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the train Sunday afternoon . Standing with the buxom woman at the altar , head bowed , Diddy wonders if this is necessary . But before he has time to back out , the reconstituted family is installed in their house . In what follows , the dream rapidly condenses a whole lifetime into a series of revulsions . A life of shouting and screaming and whining : Myra 's and the boy 's . A life of broken dishes and the stench of fried fish . A life of ceramic ashtrays spilling over with cigarette butts , dirty laundry piling up by the foot of the uncarpeted staircase , TV that 's never turned off , a thousand filaments of copper hair embedded in the parlor carpet , battered comic books wedged under the cushions of every chair in the parlor , empty beer bottles in the back porch , cockroaches in the coverless sugar bowl , sour milk in the icebox , ants in the cornflakes , tubes of toothpaste squeezed askew and their caps misplaced , corsets and brassieres and stained underpants heaped on the closet floor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Naked , thrashing about in bed with the bovine Myra , Diddy worries that someone hostile is watching . Even so , he ca n't stop . Brave Diddy , sturdier than he thought . The woman cries withp143pleasure , digs her fingernails into Diddy 's lean shoulders . ( Now ) Diddy is on his back . The woman lying to his right on her side , her head , right arm , and right leg thrown across his body . How heavy she is . Diddy pushes her off , then rolls over on his left side , drenched in sweat . Who is watching ? Does he dare to try to fill Incardona 's place as husband and father , compounding the criminal annulment of a life with the theft of an identity ? Tommy does n't seem to object . Diddy makes sure the scrawny boy has a plateful of strawberry ice cream at dinner most evenings , and tries to work up a stepfatherly interest in the Cub Scouts . But what about the murdered workman ? Havinglost his heavy body through the imprudent rite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make even a ghost . Yet the man is also too recently dead to be as faint , faded , and impotent as a ghost . Even boiled down into a little puddle of ashes , Incardona remains something more substantial . Still powerful . And pitiful . Like some sailor husband , given up as lost at sea , who steals back years later , unrecognized by his fellow townspeople because he 's grown a beard and his hair has turned white , to stand shivering in the snow outside his shabby old house . Then to creep forward , to peer in through the icy window in order to witness his beloved wife , still youthful and unlined , contentedly embracing her new husband and their baby . Yet , even as a heartbroken or embitteredEnoch Arden haunting this house , Incardona must appreciatethat Diddy gains nothing by his new life . Nothing . Diddy only means to make restitution . But dreams are never content to expound a single thought . Which is how dreams become entangled with conscious fantasy and accurate memory . Also , how dreams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now ) proceeds to explain something he 'd puzzled over , without success , during his interview that evening with Mrs. Incardona . For the woman in the dream is n't only Incardona 's wife , at present Diddy 's inheritance and lawful burden . She 's also Mary , his nurse and Paul 's . Oxlike , demented , vaguely pious , reliableMary who had fed the brothers , bathed them , dressed them , spanked them , and installed them for sleep and turned off the lights in their common bedroom since they were born . Myra Incardonap144(now) has Mary 's straight short hair , a natural faded brown , instead of her bright copper curls . And ( now ) the widow 's talk was identifiable as the same endless stream of inane wordy drivel that fell from the nurse 's mouth . Talk as physical and inexpressive as the mashed potatoes on Thursday night or the oatmeal for Monday , Wednesday , and Friday breakfasts that Mary spooned into their mouths . Talk as unvarying as her wide waist or the funny smell that lived under her arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Each evening Mary read aloud to the boys whatever gruesome accident , rape , or murder , preferably multiple , the newspaper had to offer . While vacuuming or dusting or cooking or canning or sewing on buttons , she retold the dozen stories about her eight sisters , all living , who were nuns and nurses and housewives , and her one brother , who had died falling down the kitchen stairs , an unmarried alcoholic cab driver . The same deck of reminiscences led to her late father and mother , formerly cook and coachman on a big estate in Pennsylvania . And to one superstory , consecrated by countless retellings : of the kindness of their lady and gentleman , who once summoned Mary , when she was eight , to come up to the Big House and play with their daughter for the afternoon . Unforgettable afternoon . " She was dressed so pretty . And they gave me dinner . And you should of seen my sisters ' faces when I come home that evenin ' . They did n't see why I was picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the prettiest . Oh , were they burned up ! " That talk ! There were enigmatic battles with the milkman and the butcher and the grocer , apparently over whether they had the right to cheat Mary . Battles she always claimed to have won . " Told ' em where to get off , I did . " And her faith , of which Paul and Diddy heard no end . The Church , or at least the idea of it , was nurse 's solace . Father So-and-so said it was all right that she missed mass the last three Sundays , seeing as she had two boys to bring up practically by herself . Upon rising , there were the painstakingrecitals of what they were going to eat that day for breakfast , lunch , and dinner . To Diddy and Paul , who took all their meals with Mary , the schedule of menus was all too well known . Without Mary 's daily bulletin , all they had to know was the day ,  |p145since  long ago Mary had admitted the existence of exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triad was nailed forever to a particular , unvarying day of the week . And occasionally , Mary would have an unintelligible anecdote to relate about a date she 'd had on her Wednesday off . One of the anonymousboyfriends , Diddy remembered , was a sailor . But nothing ever lasted long enough for Diddy and Paul to meet one of Mary 's suitors at some street corner , unknown to their parents . When each new one came along , Mary 's hopes rose fast , then waned even more rapidly . Disillusioned , she 'd explain that this one had gotten fresh while walking her home . Or that the other one had tried to do dirty things to her in the balcony of a movie theatre , things that had something to do with the signals that old man in Moors Park was making behind the tree one Sunday morning when Mary hurriedthem away . " Of course , I know my boys wo n't be like that when they grow up . " For many years Paul and Diddy did n't understand a word of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Mary was talking she never waited for an answer , never seemed to expect a response . Their mere physical presence sufficed . As long as Paul and Diddy could recall , they had n't actually been listening to anythingMary said . Paul was six years old and almost done with first grade when he bravely sought an audience with their mother to appeal for some independence from Mary 's suffocating ministrations and inflexible routines . Diddy , finishing second grade , gained one more reason for admiring Paul and wishing to emulate him . Is Diddy the Bold about to be born ? Not yet . Not done so easily . Usually , whatever Paul accomplished first became that much harder for Diddy to do . " Well , I lost one baby , " said Mary , ostentatiously detouring around Paul 's bed to come over to Diddy and tuck him in . " But I still got my other baby , do n't I ? " Leaning over , she hugged Diddy , partly pinned down by the sheets , to her huge bosom . Seven-year-old Diddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary was . An irrepressible sympathy for her , like a sound to which one ca n't close one 's ears . The sound meant he could n't join Paul in his independence right away . Diddy was all that remained to Mary , the sole object of her already much/confined lust to care . What a responsibility , to be someone 's Last Pleasure ! Mary would have to be very tactfully and patiently weaned , like a greedy oversized baby . The same project ( now ) with Myra Incardona . In the dream , Diddy knows he does n't intend to remain married to her forever . It 's just for a little while . Until she recovers from the shock of her husband 's death . Then Diddy would be free . Yet in the dream , Diddy thinks that it ca n't be right to have married his nurse . Mary must be so much older than he . Paul should be helping him , instead of lightheartedly claiming his liberty and then running off to enjoy it , leaving Diddy to mend the broken hearts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul to marry Incardona 's widow , the recuperative process might go much faster . Paul neither as patient nor as sentimental as Diddy . With Paul , Myra Incardona would have to do her share of the job . Has enough happened ? Diddy watches Myra Incardona , who has kicked the top sheet to the foot of their double bed and sprawls , sleeping , with her nightgown rolled above her breasts . She seems happier ( now ) . Diddy keeps to the edge of the bed . If he is to leave , he might do it best while she sleeps . Before she wakes and starts up that stream of whining babble that , surely , she ca n't expect him to listen to or take seriously . Language is sacred . As sacred as the body . Myra Incardona is one of the profaners of language , Mary 's true disciple . With Mary , it had been a wonder that Diddy had n't gone deaf . Beware of Myra . Diddy , although not as strong as he once was , does n't intend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very soft . Diddy slips over the side to his knees , hoping that Myra is n't awakened by the creaking springs . If he can find his shoes ... . " Where you goin ' , doll ? " says the woman sleepily . Diddy realizes he 's awake ( now ) . Not dreaming . The space has changed again , and this woman is blond , small-breasted , and has a large black mole on her left shoulder . " I ca n't stay the night . But I dozed off , and now , " looking at his watch , " it 's four o'clock . "  | " Suit yourself , lover , " says the woman . Without switching on the light , Biddy gathers his clothes from the floor and dresses . " Doris , I 'm going now , " he says softly . " Sure thing . Maybe I 'll see you again . " She seems almost asleep . Four-thirty . In the lobby of the Rushland , Diddy buys the " City " edition of the Courier-Gazette and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely glances through the paper before turning off the light . Before going up , Diddy has instructed the night clerk to wake him at nine o'clock . Does n't even seem a victoryof sorts not to rise at seven , as he 's done every other morning this week , for the " Late Final . " Why should Thursday 's paper have something in it for him , if there 's been nothing on Tuesday and Wednesday ? Anyway , Diddy utterly exhausted . Even four hours more of sleep wo n't be enough . Skip breakfast , take a long hot bath . Then come down in time to get the car . Just barely . Biddy is almost too late . Hurrying through the front door of the Rushland a minute after ten o'clock . Jim and the two others are already in our car , the Oriental chauffeur is softly revvingthe motor . " You just made it , Dalt , " said Jim . " We were going to leave without you . " " That would have been all right . I could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I slept later than usual . " " I bet you did . I dropped by your room about 2 a.m. to borrow your copy of the Butler memorandum , and you were n't in yet . " Biddy in the jump seat again ; did n't answer . We are moving out of the central part of the city . A brilliant sunny morning . His eyes hurt him , after so little sleep . Passing through the sedate residential streets . The three men are discussing a persistent rumor that the company may , at last , allow itself to be bought out by one of the giant firms that has made repeated offers in recent years.  | " Reager will try to pass it off as something great , " said Jim . " A merger . But you know what that means , do n't you ? Kaput . " " What do you think , Dalton ? " Fred asks . " Do n't ask him anything , " said Jim . " He 's still asleep . " Diddy , who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , quickly obscured  --  is not pondering the company 's affairs . He wishes he could . Work would be an antidote to his obscure anxieties . But Diddy is without work . Only mysterious projects . The company 's future , his own carefully tended job , are receding . Becoming intangible . Already the fourth morning , leaving only one more day . Through the gate , up the driveway . The dome shining with peculiarlyvigorous brilliance . Our car had stopped . Diddy thinks of the blue and gold dome . Once again recalls its origins , dismisses its recent use . Diddy appreciated the fantasy the dome embodies ; felt renewed , sometimes , by contemplating the eccentric energies of the man who 'd insisted on this gaudy crown to his enterprise . Diddy , going into the building . Up the elevator . Along the crowded hallway of the third floor . Into the long rectangular conferenceroom . Most of us were already seated at the oval table . Diddy opening his briefcase , taking out his notes . He admired people who loved their labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extravagances , such as Amos Watkins ' dome . Diddy 's misfortune was to lack a vocation , some activity he could perform with love . Not to have gone into a profession , such as law or medicine or teaching , or into one of the arts . Instead , Diddy had only a job , which thus far he had valiantly aspired to like better than he actually did . Sad destructive choice . For which Diddy pays dearly . After the exasperating boredom of elementary school and high school , he 'd enjoyed his pre-med studies at Dartmouth . Had been accepted at two high-ranking medical schools . What had prevented him ? Meeting Joan in July , a month after graduation ; getting married in August ; by September acceding to her insistence on moving right away to New York ? Only that ? As simple , as merely erroneous as that ? No . He refused to blame everything on Joan . If he 'd truly wanted medical school , Diddy would have found an eloquence sufficient to persuade Joan to ac/company him to Ithaca or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do what he really wanted to do . Not to do what he really did n't want to do . Diddy the Irresolute . Everyone gets the life he truly wants . One of the scientists is presenting the budget for the proposed research on revamping the Micro-Recorderscope . So he 'd never had a vocation to love . And after a long , difficult time  --  eight years  --  he did n't have Joan either . That deficit must also be charged to his account . When she left she had said that he did n't love her . Though his feelings cried calumny , maybe she 'd been right . Had he ever had anything beyond need and sexual attachment ? Where was love ? There was nothing stirring his energy to generate it . Genuine work would have fired his energy . Anything , from the most delicate problem-solving to gross labor . To love one 's work is a way of loving oneself , and leaves one freer to love other people . But beware the difference between loving one 's work and being merely engrossed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , totally absorbed in his work , had been anything but amiable . The workman had violently resented Diddy 's intruding on the scene of his labor , distracting him . Became irascible , menacing . Had moved to destroy him . Whereas if Incardona were ( now ) to burst into this conference room , no chance of Diddy being too engrossed in his work to welcome him . Diddy would go over to him , grab his arm and then , apologizing for the interruption , introduce him to Reager , Watkins , and the others . To hell with their surprise at discoveringHarron , who 's " one of us , " acquainted with a dirty , lowerclassslob . If Diddy condescended to explain to those stuffed shirts , he could say the workman was a long-lost brother of his . Or perhapssomeone brotherlike , such as the son of his old nurse . Incardonamight be disarmed by such a reception . He could observe that Diddy entertained friendly feelings toward him , and most likely meant him no harm . But Incardona is n't going to arrive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor cursing with outrage , battering open the door . Diddy tries to listen to what the others are saying . Time to vote on the new budget for the laboratory ? Or has the vote alreadyp150taken place ? Perhaps a few minutes ago Diddy raised his hand quite automatically , without knowing what he did . Diddy catches Jim gazing his way . Is it possible that that little friendly mind has some deeply buried clue to what 's preoccuping Diddy ? Unlikely . Not the same wave length . Still , Jim is looking . Diddy tears off a sheet from his pad , scribbles a sentence on it , folds the paper ; then asks Ayres , the head PR man , Diddy 's neighborto his right , to pass the note on to Allen . Jim spots the paper traveling toward him , reaches out for it , coughs . Unfolds it and reads . A perplexed look at Diddy . Then Jim , bowing his head , writes briefly on the same sheet , refolds it , has it passed back to Diddy . Furtively , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Jim , do you happen to know if there is a state law that makes an autopsy mandatory before someone is cremated ? " And Jim had scrawled below . " Yes , I believe there is . Almost positive . Why ? " Diddy looks up ; tries to fabricate an astute , friendly nod . Jim is probably right . Still , what was performed Monday or Tuesdaymorning upon Incardona was n't the autopsy Diddy wanted . The important thing for Diddy to remember is that if he wanted to check further , it was easy to find out for sure . Since Diddy tends to find any reliable piece of information soothing , why has n't he alreadyresolved this question ? Could have called the CourierGazetteor City Hall days ago to inquire about the existence of such a regulation . He can do that later . ( Now ) must try to concentrate on what 's at hand , Watkins &; Company , the present . Diddy trying to behave as if the sole reason he is upstate , living for a week in this city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assignment  --  to attend the company conference . Trying to convince himself inwardly , while he lets the rote behavior of the competent junior executive persuadethe others . Diddy the Good was taking a business trip . Banish all private projects . Especially those two . Pursuing his investigation into the workman 's death and his feelings about it . Visiting Hester in the hospital , and exploring his sentiments toward her . . . . Neither project is going well , a fact that 's making him not so much uneasyp151as somewhat giddy and lightheaded . Does this lack of success make his projects more pure ? Watkins is delivering some evasive remarks about the merger . Reassuring everyone that the executive board merely has the matterunder consideration . No final decisions have been made . Finally , the vote . The scientists , leaders of the faction Diddy has supported , carry the day . One last go at improving Scope 21 , pushing it back into first place , once more ahead of all competing models . Their motto : Do n't give up ! Diddy agrees . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both factions plausible . ( Now ) , by Thursday , Diddy is amazed these policy issues are even a subject for general debate . Does n't everyone here realize that some people just know more than other people . Do n't the scientists know far more than Reager and Watkins do about Scope 21 ? Managementjust has to trust them . And as for the merger , maybe it 's a good idea . Eating in the cafeteria on the second floor . But not cafeteria style . Due to the presence of a guest speaker , lunch was more formalthan it had been on the preceding two days . A director of the local television station outlined the projected half-hour panel discussionand interview program on which Watkins &; Company will be featured as " Business of the Month . " " We need three volunteers for the panel discussion , " said Reager after the speaker  --  his name began with H  --  sat down . " If you do n't mind , I 'll suggest a few candidates . Anyone named is of course perfectly free to refuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're not chosen . I 'm not "  --  he laughed hoarsely  --  " making a serious rating of my colleagues . " Pause . " Cornensky . " A blackhairedyoung biochemist at the end of the head table took a spoonfulof fruit salad out of his mouth and nodded without expression . " Michaelson . " Head of sales , West Coast . Another expressionless nod . " Harron . " Though Diddy surely knew his own last name , he did wait a few seconds ; then realized with embarrassment that he 'd been wandering again . Waiting for someone else to say the yes for him ? He nodded , too . " Good , " said Reager . " Now this wo n't take up too much of your time . We 'll need you for a briefing tonight at the Channel 10p152studio at nine-fifteen . Mr. Watkins and I will be there , of course . " " Just a quick run-through , " said the TV producer , trying to be helpful . Reager pretended to ignore the interruption . " And then we meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , live , at 11 a.m . Saturdaymorning . " " That 's right , " chimed in the man from the television station , again without having been invited to speak . Reager frowned . Coffee was being brought in . The head table , where Reager and Watkins sat , no longer solicited the attention of everyone else in the room . The noise level steadily rising . Having downed one cup of coffee , Diddy was already on his second when he felt a hand on his shoulder . Jim leaning over ; hushed voice . " Why did you say yes to Reager , you dope ? You could leave for New York Friday night . Now you 're stuck here through Saturday . " " I do n't mind , " whispered Diddy . " I 'd planned to hang around for the weekend anyway . A friend of mine has just checked into the Warren Institute here for an operation . " " Oh , sorry , " said Jim . " But hey , before I forget , what the hell was that goofy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to know . I was thinking about something . " Ernst Wildhaber , one of the scientists , who was seated on biddy'sleft , got up ; Jim slid into his seat . Smiled . " Sure is a strange thing to want to know in the middle of all  --  this . " Jim waved his arm eloquently . " Unless there is a connection somewhere . Like you 're all pissed off about the merger and planning to bump Reager off . Query . Will autopsy detect arsenic in the creamed chicken and peas , or wo n't it ? " " Something like that , " said Diddy . " Well , when you 've got all your plans set up and your poisons operational , let me know . I might come in on it with you . Okay ? " " Promise , " said Diddy . " But what I 'm really hoping for is to make you my accomplice . From now on , I wo n't commit a murder without your advice . " " Just come up with something that leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can count me in . That is , unless I beat you to it andp153just shove one of those creeps out the window by tomorrow . I 'm a pretty impulsive guy , you know . " Diddy , light in the head , aerated almost , wondering where this conversation was going to lead . What was the next sentence ? The one after that ? Was it possible that he 's about to tell Jim about the undetected crime he 's already committed ? And after telling , to have yet one more incredulous auditor ? Sitting on the edge of his chair , Diddy sips his coffee . Waiting for the sticky strip of words to spurt from his mouth . Jim has turned away to talk to Denton of R &D,; the man on his left . Anythingmight happen . The urgent blood in his head is spiraling down into his chest . Something hard , cubelike , rising in the back of his throat . He leans toward Jim . But just then Wildhaber returned to claim his seat ; signaling the waitress for a fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't drink it . And Jim went back to his own table . On the agenda for Thursday afternoon : a special tour of the plant , whose theme is the recently installed manufacturing equipmentof which Watkins is so proud . For the benefit , mainly , of the representatives of the company 's sales force present at the conference . One of Diddy 's tasks in New York , before coming up for the week , had been to prepare and oversee the printing of a brochure explaining the new automated machines for the salesmen to take away with them . A mailing of this material was going out to the rest of the salesmen across the country . Diddy decided he could skip the tour without anyone caring . At first , was going to phone Hester to say he was coming over immediately ; instead of this evening . Then decides to arrive without giving prior notice , hoping that her aunt might wander out or have to leave early . But as Diddy comes down the corridor on Hester 's floor , sees Mrs. Nayburn pacing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expecting him . She does n't waste a minute before beginning to fawn . Hester 's pimp . He sees the woman gazing triumphantlyat the flower 's he 's carrying.  | " Any news from the doctor ? " Diddy said mechanically . Mrs. Nayburn announces that the tests have been completed . Assuming a suitable cornea is available from the Eye Bank , Hester'soperation will take place tomorrow . " And what does the doctor say ? " Diddy feeling somehow that what he 's heard must be bad news . " Only that we should n't expect too much . My poor darling . She 's being so brave . " " I 'm going in now . " " You go right ahead and do that , Dalton dear . She 'll be tickled pink to see you . And I think I 'll just leave you two alone . " An unexpected gift . Entering the room , Diddy was shocked at the pallor of Hester 's face behind the black glasses . She looked up . " It 's me , " he says . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filling an empty vase with water and setting the flowers in it . Which he places on Hester 's night table before he sits close beside her . " Oh , roses . Thank you . " Pleased , Diddy takes her hand and kisses the palm . " How are you today ? " " Sad . " " Are you worried about tomorrow ? Nervous ? " " Not really . " She laughs gloomily . " I know the operation is n't going to be successful . " " Why are you so sure of that ? Is it something the doctors said ? " " No . They try to keep up my morale . But I know . " Diddy gazes at Hester 's face , which he has never seen register such misery . How could he have found that innocent , vulnerable face inexpressive ? Her bed is disorderly , and the sheets crumpled . She must have slept badly last night . " Look , Hester , it 's true many corneal transplants are n't successful . But many are . Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin graft from someone else or acquiring someone else 's kidney . A graft in the eye will take , in a fairly large number of cases . The eye is special , not so adept as the rest of the body at rejecting foreign substances . You know , there are n't any blood vessels in the cornea.  |p155And  the eye in general has fewer antibodies than other organs ... . But I 'm sure your doctors have told you all that . " " How do you know so much ? " " My father was a doctor . And I was pre-med in college . " Diddy , hearing a replay of his last words inside his head , felt anew the grotesque intersection of their situations . Hester , unable to see with the naked watery eyes God had given her . Himself , engaged in publicizing the machine-eye that assumes the normal skills of unaided sight , and seeks to move beyond them . To a man wielding a microscope , his own seeing eyes are blind . The girl seemed to be weighing what Diddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself in her face . Could she be so naive as to imagine that all she would need to be happy , always happy , is to recover her eyesight ? If that 's what she imagines , then think what Hester suffers , sure as she is that she 's not going to see . Either not ever or never again ? . . . Not only does the imagination dupe us , so we 're always hankering after what we do n't have , and in particular what we 've lost ; as if its possession or repossession would be our salvation . Diddy also thinks how the imagination localizes suffering . Creates and re-creates imaginary anatomies : exoticcavities , magic cartilage , organs of the secret life . Yes , eyes are special . But besides the eyes of the flesh , which are mostly water , there are the secret eyes . That either see or do not see . This is the only consolation Diddy dares to offer Hester , since he must take seriously her premonition that the surgery will fail . Do n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? In a way most people with sight ca n't . And that most of what people are looking at with their eyes is just debris . Gertrude , the nurse , comes through the door with the bare thermometerin hand to stick in Hester 's mouth , and bustles about the room with a vaguely censorious air while waiting for the necessary time to elapse before taking it out . Leaves , after giving Hester a large white pill to swallow . " How disagreeable that woman is , " exclaims Diddy . They have n't spoken while she was in the room . " Very . "  |p156Damn  them all ! But no , we were talking about something . " About what I said before , Hester . What do you say ? " The girl shifted in her bed ; readjusting her pillows . Diddy hastenedto assist her . " What do you say , Hester ? " " That you overestimate me . " " Not at all . " " Yes . You think I have some special wisdom because I 'm blind . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was making that connection . Only rediscovering the paradox of the wise person who happens to be blind as well . Diddy about to apologize for his tactless presumption , when the girl , in a timorous tone , went on . " Maybe you 're right . Being blind does make one see better in a way . Nothing is either ugly or beautiful . When that 's not of concern , an awful lot of scum is blown off the mind and the feelings . " Diddy , in his chair , feels her words as an immense blow . Though they take a few moments to traverse some unidentified distance . A good blow , like the harsh stroke of an osteopath knocking a dislocated shoulder into place . Not painful at first . The blow is moving out , in ever widening circles . ( Now ) Diddy feels  --  there 's no other word for it  --  exact . Exactly where he is ; being exactly where and how he wants to be . Can a few quiet words do that ? Strip something away to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his life ? Not ever . Like being in the very center of somethingdense , surging , and resilient . In the center , but with no sense of being pressed in on all sides . A feeling of plenitude , instead . And of harrowing lucidity . ( Now ) the blow , having rushed past him , already light years away , begins to ache . Tears rinse his eyes . Falling toward the mattress , the crown of his head against Hester 's left thigh , Diddy comes undone . His shoulders bulge with sobs , which he can not , dares not , try to control . But Hester does n't lean forward to embracehim . Without sitting up , she extends one arm and rests her palm between his shuddering shoulder blades . Diddy waits for her touch to become healing , to stanch the warm grief . It does n't . " Tell me , " says the girl.  | " I ca n't . " But he can . Words have dropped the temperature , chilled his grief , begun to still its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many things . For you . For me . And over what you said just now . If you only knew how I suffer from my kind of seeing . How it hurts to see everything . . . almost everything as ugly . " " You mean yourself . " " Me , too . Sure . " More words . Surely Hester knows what they 're doing to him . She must want it to happen . Diddy dry-eyed ( now ) . Dry withered grief . " That 's why you accuse yourself of crimes . " If only it were so ! Diddy sighed . Hester knew so much , yet she knew nothing . " I 'm sorry . I said it would n't be good for us to talk about that , and now I 'm breaking the rule . Dalton , tell me something else . Tell me who you like or love . " " I loved my wife . At least I thought I did . I guess I love my brother , too , in a way . But I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love him ; I 'd just like to be him . . . . I think I do n't really like anybody except you . " The girl was silent . " I wish I could embrace you right now . " Then realizing that , being only inches away from her , he could do exactly that ; if he wanted . But it is n't a simple embrace Diddy wants , so he does n't reach out at all . " I want to make love to you . " Since they 're not touching , Diddy has to look up . Discovers it 's come back , no trick of memory : that same inexpressive face that he had seen yesterday . A face like a dead animal , or an internal organ never meant to be seen . Throbbing , opaque , not addressed to him or to anyone else . Disconnected . Suddenly Diddy feels horriblyrestless . Has to stand up and pace about the room . Glancing intermittently at Hester as he stalked , pivoted , and stalked . Her head was tilted downward . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A kind of vertigo , which he 's walking off . Diddy alarmed . What 's he been getting into ? There 's some kind of strong positive feeling for her , yes . But maybe it 's mainly pity ; what he 'd felt once for a maimed stray cat he took in and nursed . Not love.  |p158Looks  at his watch . Only four-thirty . Diddy ends the silence , starts making excuses to leave . Still striding up and down , tearing apart . Though he senses how disappointed she is at his early departure , the need to leave is beyond his control . " Do n't go , Dalton . The visiting hour is n't over yet . " But Diddy wo n't stay only because she wants him to . To be a shade kinder , he produces a lie . " I have a business meeting at five . You know , it was hard finding any time today to visit you . " Not the first lie he 's told Hester . Of course , Hester is n't fully acquainted with Diddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lying , and decides anyway that the lie is to count as the truth . She 'll accede to his need to be outside , to breathe . Ungraciously , resentfully even , she agrees to his going . " But wait . " She pulls his arm as he stands by the bed to kiss her goodbye . " This will only take a moment . Please comb me . My aunt usually does it , but she pulls my hair . I want you to do it . " " I 'll be late . " " It 'll just take a minute . Please ! " " All right . " Diddy , anxious , distracted , takes the comb from the night-table drawer and sits on the edge of Hester 's bed . His coat already on , buttoned . With his right hand , he pushes the comb into the thick center of the girl 's long silky blond hair ; with his left hand he holds the upper portion of the hair he 's combing downward so that if the comb has to plow its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a higher place and prevent it from being strained at its roots in the scalp . " I knew you could do it like that , without hurting . It 's nice . " Diddy , pleased that he can please her , instantly becomes one of the other Diddys again . He leans over for a moment to smell her hair and brush it with his lips . " Do n't you want to stay ? " Hester has seized his hands . Diddy 's panic returns . His old panic , that of not understanding . His lips go dry ; his head , the back of his neck , his armpits wet with sweat . Putting down the comb , his job unfinished . " I have to go , " he says obstinately . " I 'm sorry because it 's the day before your operation . . . . "  | " That 's all right . Please stop . " And Diddy flees . Of course , he has nowhere to go ( now ) . Since he 's not due at the television studio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return to the Rushland . Once there , try to nap for a few hours . But not yet . Not so quickly closed within another synthetic small space . Diddy wants to remain outdoors in the yellowish twilight . And , tired as he is , to stroll . Walking down routine streets , vaguely headed for the center of town . Diddy is probably going to walk all the way , though it 's not necessary to decide that in advance . The heavy emotions are what animate him ( now ) . Which is why it 's some help to keep moving his legs . As soon as he 'd left the hospital building , his panic was replaced by shame . Diddy feels ashamed of himself . A heavy vitreous emotion , two-thirds of the way from water to something dense and viscous . Shame floods his body with phlegm . And in the yellowish twilight , sullen violet thoughts . Diddy has at his disposal only the shadows of energy with which to struggle up , hauling himself hand over hand , into a clear light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Scraping his palms and knees . Unwilling to admit defeat , or the presence of an insurmountable wall . What 's the matter with him ? You 'd think Diddy was trapped back there in the hospital in the same fashion that he was trapped , or thought he was , in the darkened train compartment Sunday afternoon . No one had him in a corner ( now ) . A beautiful woman who was offering him love had aroused in him an unprecedented tenderness and longing . What could be more different from a trap ? A liberation , rather . A blessing . A miracle . Diddy is heading toward the center of town . As he walks , his bony nervous arms within the tweed jacket and the Chesterfield coat punching at the air below his waist . Diddy is enraged at himself for having fled his good . For having pained his new love . Ordinarily , Diddy was not indecisive . Rarely shy with women . Ifp160he 'd behaved so erratically and self-indulgently with Hester , it must be connected with other matters that have become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : that absence of clarity or outright confusion in one , just one specific , local matter will end by infecting the whole of one 's judgment . Diddy , like any animal , has two eyes . Let 's suppose that one eye is diseased , or has been traumatized . That stands for Incardona'sdeath , and its attendant enigmas . The other eye is a perfectlyhealthy organ . That one stands for his tie with Hester , and their deepening connection with each other . With this condition , how could he have been such a fool ? Foolish enough to expect one 's clear-sighted eye can remain uncontaminated by the diseased one . Man , a creature of binocular vision , uses both eyes to see ; with both eyes moving conjointly , can perceive depth . But it is well known that if one eye has a severe inflammation or a serious infection , or even so grave a flaw as a detached retina , which comes about through a physical injury to that eye alone , the same conditioneventually tends to appear in the other eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That sympathy for the damaged part of him was what was blurringhis relations with Hester . If he does n't take care , he will ruineverything . As he 's always known : the two , Hester and Incardona , go together . In him their destinies are linked . Good eye and badeye , beautiful vision and recurrent nightmare . To feel properlyabout one he must decide , once and for all , how he feels about both . About the workman 's death . Does Diddy feel guilty or does n't he ? Since he called on Myra Incardona last night  --  was it only last night ? it seems ages behind him  --  he feels less . Less guilty . That 's as it should be . Those people are really animals . One should n't waste emotion on their fate . It 's people like the Incardonas who make life a nightmare . Diddy wo n't feel guilty . He ca n't . No room in his life for guilt . For if Diddy so much as admitsguilt through the door , front door or back door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dwellings , the puffingswelling monster will end by dispossessing him entirely.  |p161About  the girl . What does he feel toward this delicate , troubled creature ? Who 's strong , perhaps , where he is weak , but surely weak in some ways in which he 's strong . Here , his feelings are clearer . The stupidity of running away ! ( Now ) Diddy believes he really loves her . And he longs for Hester to know of his love , if it will give her pleasure . To know before she 's wheeled into the operating room tomorrow morning . Footsore Diddy , his heart beating faster than usual , is nearing the downtown section of the city . ( Now ) is the time to acknowledgethat he does n't want a taxi . Noticing that the clock on a bank facade says it 's already a quarter to six , he goes into a drugstore and asks the soda jerk if there 's a post office nearby . Yes . Arriving at five minutes to six , stands at the sloping counter carpeted with tan blotting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to his left : an elderly Negro woman , wearingthe clothes of the self-respecting poor , has crumpled up one yellow form with a sigh and started another . Probably a request for money . Or the announcement of a relative 's death . Diddy 's telegram should be delivered to the Warren Institute in less than an hour . Who will read it to Hester ? Hopefully , Mrs. Nayburnwo n't have returned yet . Then it would be the disagreeable Gertrude who brings the telegram to Hester 's room . But if it should be the crass meddling aunt who recites his declaration , so what ? Diddy has nothing to hide . The woman on his left is still struggling to print the letters . That make up the words . That make up the news , probably bad ; or the plea for assistance . Diddy , who always got A 's in Penmanship , has his own reasons for printing on his telegram form almost as slowly as she . For bearing down as hard as he can on the fatigued ballpointpen , one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing counter . Diddy digs the blunt point into the paper , as if he thought it was this piece of paper that would be delivered to Hester . And wanted to make something Braille-like that she could decipher herself , by moving her fingertips along the indentations . Of course , he knows perfectly well that this is n't so . Telegrams come typed . And must be read aloud to the blind . Perhaps Diddyp162is writing in this heavy fashion because he wants to engrave the words on himself . I LOVE YOU . I AM WITH YOU TOMORROW MORNING . DALTON . Diddy has n't returned to the Rushland . Leaving the post office , he continued on foot toward the center of town . After sending the telegram , easier to walk . Except for being hungry , feels he could walk forever . Stopped off at a small Chinese restaurant and ordered a cup of wonton soup and a plate of barbecued spareribs , but the soup was water and the ribs burnt meatless . Diddy plays with the inedible food a few moments , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be so fastidious . Second stop : a pizzeria , where he downs without complain a doughy triangle smeared with tastelesscheese and tomato sauce , then another , then a third , then a fourth . Since eight o'clock he 's been wandering up and down a brightly lit street about fifteen blocks from the Rushland . Diddy is looking . " Science has proved that 90% of all knowledge is acquired visually . " What about the other ten percent ? Do those who have to make do on that small fraction discover the ninety percent to be a distraction ? Seeing an adulteration of genuine knowledge ? Or is seeing necessary ? Is it like " Ninety percent of the eye is water " ? The viscous medium needed to support and shelter the miniature organs , the bland sea needed to float the precious intricate devices of sight ? Diddy looking . Is that necessary ? On a brightly lit street on which are congregated a burlesque house , a movie theatre showing skin flicks , two penny arcades jammed with leather-jacketed motorcyclists and girls in miniskirts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back-number magazines , devices for practical jokers , and sex books . Diddy is looking . Comparing the sizes of breasts in the stills displayed outside thep163Casino Burlesque with those outside the Victory Theatre . Browsing in old issues of National Geographic and Silver Screen in one bookstore ; the latest issues of The Justice Weekly , The Spanker 's Monthly , and The Ladder in another . Diddy the Voyeur . What does he feel ? Amused ? Disgusted ? Curious ? Something , but not very much , of all three . Yet Diddy is trying to feel . Feels more in one of the novelty stores , examining rubber monster masks . When he tries on a limp cool mask of Frankenstein 's monster ; and sees his rectangular , stitched , pathetic Boris Karloff face in the mirror . The harsh , sad joke of Diddy the Monster . Dreamed by Diddy the Good . . . . All the looking has made him vaguely restless in a sexual way . As he 's leaving the novelty store , Diddy stops before another mirror . Admired his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his biceps , then approvingly feels the muscle he 's made in his left arm with his right hand . Diddy touring one of the arcades . ( Now ) dispensing quarters for the shooting gallery at the back . He 's already weighed himself : eighteen pounds underweight . And read the fortune which the machineejected . " You are about to take an important trip . " Diddy laughs and sticks the white card into his wallet . Has already tested the strength of his handgrip . " Above average , " if the machine is to be believed . Which is not bad for a man who 's pale as the inmate of a maximum-security penitentiary , and lean as a mandrake root . He has also played six games on a pinball machine . And on another machine , tested his skill as a driver . " Good Insurance Risk . " ( Now ) Diddy has been sufficiently expert with the breech-lock rifle , scoring with every one of the last ten ducks that bobbed across the target area , to have won a prize . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set of six wine glasses , mister ? " Diddy chooses the stuffed panda , a foot-tall thick creature with big round ears and festoons of red ribbon about its neck ; carries his prize onto the street . Into a taxi , and gives the driver the address of the television studio . Which turns out to be quite near , so Diddy finds he 's the first to have arrived . Quarter to nine . The Channel 10 executive who 'd been at the company lunch today greets him , asking Diddy if he'dp164prefer to wait in the reception area and watch TV , or come in and observe what 's happening in the studios at this very moment . " I 'll come in , " says Diddy . " Where can I put this ? " The panda . No explanation . " On the receptionist 's desk ? " replies the producer doubtfully . " Okay ? She 's gone home for the night . " Diddy wonders if he 's about to be asked where he got the panda , or why he 's carrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man through a pair of swinging doors . " Silence . " Down a corridor , to what Diddy 's guide refers to as " our Studio A. " At one end of a very large room , whose ceiling is two floors high and crisscrossed with lighting equipment , the local community theatre is taping their biggest success last spring , Long Day 's Journey into Night , for NET ; to be shown locally next month , says the man . Diddy peers through the huge window . Hard to get a good view of the actors or even of the set , because the cameramen are continually rolling their black machines in and out for close-ups . And since he 's on the other side of a glass wall , Diddy is experiencing the play only as a soundless pantomime . Nevertheless , having seen the play on Broadway as well as the movie , he recognizes the passage the actors are performing . Remembering not only the sense of the scene , but even some of the lines . The play had moved Diddy greatly ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a portrait of the playwright himself , finally indicts his debauched older brother ; confronts him with the failure of his life . With love , with compassion , with loathing . But that 's almost simple , compared to the impasse between Diddy and his brother . Is it Diddy who should reproach Paul ? Or Paul , Diddy ? On to our Studio B. A much smaller room . " We 're taping part of the eleven o'clock news . Most of that goes out live , except for where we use some newsreel footage . They 're timing that now . " Is it the same man ? Yes . There in the spacious soundproofed cube , seated behind his desk , a map of the world at his left , a screen on his right , is the bland creature whose every word Diddy had strained to hear only four evenings ago . Last Sunday night that face was a blurred image on the glassy surface of the picture tube , its features built up out ofp165tiny lines . ( Now ) it is the man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Glass does intervene . As a large rectangular wall that separatesthem , keeping Diddy outside and the newscaster inside ; but at least it is n't the glass itself which renders the face . " Is it possible to hear what he 's saying ? " Diddy whispers to the producer at his side . Certainly . The man presses a red button next to the entrance to the studio . Yes , there 's the unctuous , denatured voice . For all the naturalnessof the sound , Diddy might as well be watching the televisionin his room at the Rushland , lying on his bed . But maybe the quality of the sound reproduction in the corridor is n't to blame . Remember , this is the voice belonging to the man who reads the news who had no news , no information . Did he tonight ? Not tonight , either . Just more about the unspeakable war , the one in which territory does n't change hands and the sole measure of each victory is how many small-boned yellow bodies , with flesh charred by napalm or shattered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the battle . Waiting to be counted . The newscaster deploys the usual senseless numbers ; repeats the well-worn gruesome tautologiesof self-righteousness . With a broadly serious set to his face . Lies , but terrible smiling lies . The producer has excused himself , and left Diddy lingering alone outside the viewing window of Studio B. Diddy presses his face against the glass ; listening . If Diddy were given to tirades , he could deliver one ( now ) . The words burning his throat . But against whom would it be aimed ? There are so many targets for his revulsion , not least of which is himself . Diddy the Self-Denouncer . But he is scarcely the only thing that 's wrong in this world . The newscaster has stood up , and is jabbing a pointer against the map behind his desk . There 's no end to Diddy 's rage ; little economy in it , either . How can one slake the rage for self-correction ? Provoked by the lies and inanities being disseminated by the newscaster , Diddy will once more try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The newscaster has some words to add to a still photograph ,  |p166|projected  on a screen to his left , which shows an American soldier interrogating a kneeling , blindfolded , teenage enemy prisoner of war . But Diddy is n't listening any more . Reminded of the behavior of his own country , currently engaged in the cumbersome , drawn-out murder of a small defenseless nation  --  this being only the latest of the century 's roll call of historical atrocities , of crimes that baffle the imagination  --  Diddy 's own agonizingduring the last four days over the death of merely one person shrank ( now ) to humiliating size . Considered as an action performedon this planet and in this decade , what Diddy has done is barely visible . Set Daddy 's deed against the scale of reality , and it seems petty and amateurish . And his lacerating remorse little more than presumption , a kind of boastfulness ; at best , the foolish endearingweakness of the overcivilized . Diddy the Demonic must learn the diminutive proportions of his misdeeds . By this , Diddy does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Incardona . Murder remains murder , a sluggish and putrid stain upon the feelings . As a death is still a death . Dalton Harron is no longer Diddy the Good , if indeed he ever was . That may be conceded . Still , it 's right to consider those far more vicious and ample murders being committed , ceaselessly , all over the world . With the assassins scarcely ever suffering the slightest ache of guilt . Why would they ? When it 's done for one 's country , one is cheered for slaying a hundred Incardonas every hour : not only bashing in the skulls of the husbands , who may in some cases be able to defend themselves , but disemboweling the wives and throwing the children out of the window , too . It 's the rare spirit , the exceptional murderer , who knows enough to feel guilty anyway  --  even though he 's praised for his deed , and congratulatedfor doing his job . And the others , like Diddy , who have n't been licensed , who 've stayed out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , have their corresponding , equally gullible role to enact . Diddy , too . Though he should know better . For the questionable reward of being at peace with his neighbors , Diddy has swallowed the rotten bait.  |p167Taken  for his own truth the old lies about what makes an act good or bad . It 's not for an act of violence , resulting in a death , that Diddy flogs himself ; and would , if he were caught by the law , be executed or at least shut away in prison . It 's for not having the relevant job or identity , that of a hero or a professional killer . For not having a cause . For lacking a sanctifying public goal . For only killing , not overkilling . Diddy , looking through the window at the bland newscaster , is glad to be reminded of the world . His own crime last Sunday appears in a saner perspective . And , which is more important , so does his ordeal of guilt . Had n't Diddy the Educated known all this for years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like himself serves no one but the mighty , consecrated killers of entire peoples . Confirming their authority . Making them more secure , more inviolate . Today no one has the right to be innocent about these matters , and Diddy is ashamed of his innocence . Over Incardona , what a waste of agony . Over Hester , what a risk of love . A squeak of door hinges ; enter heavy feet in a parody of tiptoeingacross the carpet . James Watkins , Hubert 's burly son , approaches . " Hello , Harron . See you got here early . " Diddy shifted his legs mechanically , turned away from the smiling herald of absent-minded genocide on the far side of the large glass pane . Holding out his hand . " Hello , Mr. Watkins . " Out into the reception area . Comensky had arrived , too , and was sprawled on a couch ; thumbing through a tattered issue of Life . " The others will be along any moment , I guess , " said Watkins , rubbing his dry reddish hands together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sat down . " Can I have one , too ? " said Comensky . " I 'm trying to stop , so I do n't buy them any more . " Diddy nodded , held out the pack . " Say , Harron , did you see my latest thing in the Transactions of the American MicroscopicalSociety ? " Diddy said he had n't . " Hell , I 'm glad I thought to bring a few offprints along with me tonight . " Holding the unlit cigarette in his left hand and matches in his right . Comensky stuckp168the cigarette in his mouth ; began to dig one-handed into his inside jacket pocket . The wrong hand . Did n't Comensky remember he was , as he evidently was , right-handed ? Eventually he has to put the matches somewhere , too , before he could pull out an offprint and shove it into Diddy 's hand . " Thanks , " said Diddy . A few minutes later , Reager and Michaelson came through the door . ( Now ) we were ready , the group complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they had both come from Reager 's house ; to which Michaelson had been invited for dinner , where he had put away one of those lavish meals with too many sauces , and himself been served up as the evening 's morsel for Reager 's ever less attractive , still unmarried daughter . They seemed to be talking about Evie as they entered . " Hey , Alex , " Comensky called to Michaelson , " you did n't happen to see my piece in the summer issue of Transactions , did you ? " Michaelson shook his head . " Wait , I brought you one . Just a minute . Do n't go away . I have it here in my pocket . " Without giving the least encouragement to this gift , Michaelson slumped down on the left side of the long couch . Diddy ( now ) in the middle . Trying to keep clear of Comensky 's elbow flailing out to his right . For again , Comensky has to dismiss , temporarily , the useful objects that seem naturally to encumber his hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the hallway must be balancedon the narrow armrest of the couch , a copy of the CourierGazetteset down on one knee , a barely smoked cigarette stubbed out in the free-standing metal ashtray next to the couch . Comensky plunges one hand inside his jacket , pulling at something . Almost as if he were , very awkwardly , trying to undress himself . Like a man with an urgent need to piss who discovers his pants have an unfamiliarbutton fly instead of the usual zipper . Diddy is amused by Comensky 's awkward zeal on his own behalf . The persistence of the born collector . Comensky , yet one more collector to have recently passed before Diddy 's view , does n't collect little objects or trophies . Like postage stamps , or seashells . This time , someone who collects his own ideas ; then eagerly gives away , even to those who are n't interested , printed transcriptions of them . The items he purveys are n't the true prize , the original ar/tide of value , as is the case with stamp collectors trading real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like souvenirs . We were all sitting ( now ) . The two senior men , Watkins and Reager , have commandeered the comfortable lounge chairs stationedin opposite corners , facing the long couch . On the couch , the three junior men . Michaelson had been handed his offprint and pocketed it . Comensky was looking at the paper again . Diddy , just being . Trying to be . A very brief wait . Then the producer of " Your Community " entersthe reception area through the swinging doors , his arm around the shoulder of the newscaster . " So try to work that in too , will you ? " " Roger , " the newscaster said . " See you in an hour . " And opened the front door . " See you , Bud . " The door closed behind the newscaster . The producer turns to the five men . " All here ? " Beaming . " Good ! Let 's go into one of the rehearsal rooms , so we can start right away .... " " I 'd rather we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spacing out his phrases to allow for several puffs on his cigar . " There 's someone joining us in a moment . Then we can move inside . " He puffed some more on the cigar , as if to underscore how comfortable he found his chair and to demonstrate his body 's unwillingness to move . Diddy immediately guessed what mood Reager 's in . He was goingto give the producer a hard time and see how he responded . How did the man respond ? " Certainly , Mr. Reager . " Well , that 's that . The producer has lost . Reager , who was full of whims , scorned anyone who yielded to them without at least a token struggle . Which is what the producer had done . Changing his schedule to suit Reager , without so much as a question . Reager must want to fight . Does n't he know he 's already won ? But the producer has an ally . Watkins , who was n't afraid of bickering and liked giving Reager a run for his money . " Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming ? " Watkins held an unlit pipe in his hand . Reager turned on him coolly . " It 's a surprise . " Who is coming , Diddy wondered ? Has Reager added someonep170to the program without telling anyone else ? Some new young man , a rising star of the company , whom he wants to flatter ? Or will it just be Reager 's beloved Evie , carted along in the unquenchable hope that some day some young man will find her attractive ? Of course , the producer did n't know what was going on . Or how far matters had advanced . Still optimistic or merely insensitive , he was busily organizing our temporary work space . Intending by this shaping of space to assert his own authority . He 'd gone out for a moment , then returned with a metal folding chair which he places in the center of the reception area . Then straddled the chair , with both arms hugging the back of the chair to his chest . " Now . " Looking from face to face . " As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be as informal as possible . Your Community ' is a monthly public affairs show , sponsored by the Downtown MerchantsAssociation , and designed to give people in the area served by Channel 10 a better understanding of the free enterprise system , and the problems and responsibilities of American businessmen . Your firm , being one of the oldest and most respected industries in this neck of the woods , is a natural for the show . In fact , I ca n't understand why we have n't had you folks on before . " Diddy knew . Until recently , the company 's directors had simply not seen any benefit for sales in public relations addressed to the general public . That Watkins and Reager had ( now ) consented to " Your Community " doing a show on the company was more evidenceof how much , in the last year , the serenity of the managementhad been shaken . " Anyway , now we 've got you , " continued the producer . " And we 're real pleased . But this show we 're going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Department Store , our last **30;8163;TOOLONG . Everybody knows about department stores . Or they think they do . But microscopes are pretty technical stuff . Am I right ? " " Go on , " said Reager . He looked at Diddy , who looked away . " Do you mean that you do n't know much about microscopes ? " " Well , when it comes to science , all us laymen are pretty muchin the same boat . My point is this , Mr. Reager , I 'm afraid thisis n't educational television . Though Lord knows , I wish it were . "  | " Listen , Harvey , why do n't you tell me exactly what you 're drivingat ? " said Reager , grimacing . A first name or the man 's last name ? The producer , who was either First Name Harvey or Harvey Last Name , Diddy could n't remember ( now ) , shifted in his fiat metal saddle . " It 's really very simple , nothing to worry about . All I mean is that we are a sponsoredshow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You know . " He smiled , as if demonstrating the exact quantity of viewers ' pleasure he had in mind . " It 's fine if people watching the show learn something . But they should be able to enjoy themselves watching us , too . " " Us ? " " Well , naturally , Mr. Reager , I have to include myself , since I 'm privileged to act as your host on the show . And speaking of yours truly , this is as good a time as any for me to explain what I 'm going to do . You gentlemen can get an idea of what you 'll be doing . " " Fire away , " said Watkins genially . Diddy had noticed that the old man usually made a point of being amiable whenever he noticed that Reager was annoyed at something . And Reager was annoyed , unmistakably . Is n't it odd , thought Diddy , what irritates people ? This Mr. Harvey or Harvey Somethinghad given Reager no particular offense . Sure , he was an effusivefool . But so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contact . Why had this man been singled out ? And what accounts for the instant unprovoked antipathy that sometimes arises between people ? And does a person always know when  --  by his sheer existenceor quality or smell or look , and not by anything particular he 's done  --  he has unwittingly created that sort of feeling in someone ? If one 's instincts are in order , one should know . Something wrong with Diddy 's instincts : that he had n't recognized he had aroused such a feeling in Incardona , from the moment he 'd broken in on the scene of his labor on the track . Likely , though , that Incardona'ssensory apparatus was in good order . Likely that he knew he 'd aroused the same kind of instant antipathy in Diddy . And , knowing it , started to react to it with anger and hostility  --  long be/fore Diddy knew what he himself felt . Known it , how ? Felt it ? Smelled it ? Mr. Harvey or Harvey Something seemed to be receiving some of the vibrations of hostility from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He paused , gazed from face to face . Diddy watched from behind his wall , observes him reflecting . Has Reager already made him lose his balance ? Maybe . The producer seemed to realize that the time had arrived to make a stand . Now or never . If it was n't too late . Without acknowledging the last words spoken , perhaps because Watkins seemed to be on his side without being asked , and without looking at Reager , he turned to the three junior men on the couch . " Mr. Michaelson , Mr. Barron , and Mr. Comensky , we have n't heard from you . Have any questions you 'd like to ask ? " Diddy , knowing that this was a rebuke to Reager 's cantankerousness . But doubting that this move to bring them into the conversationcould work . For one thing , the two men on either side of Diddy had n't been listening . Some minutes ago , Comensky had taken still another reprint of his article from the supply stashed in the inside of his jacket , placed it on top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had been , all this while , surreptitiouslyrereading it . Michaelson had a pad and pencil in his lap , ostensibly , to take notes ; already has covered several pages with doodles of naked women and airplanes . That leaves Diddy , who had been listening . But , though listening , reluctant to say anything(now) . Why should he bait this fool , since Reager seemed to have become , in a brief time , so devoted to that task ? And why should he appease or mollify him , which was the role that had fallen to Watkins ? What could Diddy say ? " Well . . . It 's Mr. Harvey , is n't it ? " A lucky guess . The producer nodded , affably . " How long have you been doing this show , Mr. Harvey ? " Diddy meant his words to be neutral . But they 'd come outsounding like sarcasm , and Mr. Harvey flinched perceptibly atwhat he took to be a fresh rebuke from so unexpected a quarter . From across the room , Reager waved one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to the team of baiters.  |p173Diddy  the Depressed . How hard it is to say anything , just for itself . With the best will in the world , you find that you are saying it for someone . Someone , not you , whom you have no conscious desire to serve . Diddy wishing he could reroute his words . Comensky went on reading his own article ; Michaelson was still doodling . Diddy , who thought he might be blushing , imagines he is somewhere else . " Okay , here goes , " said the producer , flinging out his cheerful tone as if it were a net in which he might entrap the others . " We 're all busy executives , right ? So I 'll make this as brief as I can . " Reager yawned . Watkins finally lit his pipe . " Here 's the format of the show . First , I 'll give a little introductory material on microscopes . You know , background . Then I 'll be commenting on some stills we 'll project that show activities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to the present day . Then the panel discussion in which Huron , Comensky , and Michaelson are participating , that I 'll moderate . Then I 'll introduce Mr. Watkins , who 'll tell us , I hope , a little about his grandfather , his father , and himself . You know , the human interest aspect . After that , some remarks by Mr. Reager , your managing director . We 'll follow with footage of the factory and offices as they look today , and close with some shots of the company picnic at Lake Canandaigua last May . All the visuals have been supplied by Mr. Wurst ; and we 've made a selection from what he gave us which I 'll run off for you tonight . " Diddy looked over at Reager to see how he was taking it . Not too well , Diddy suspected . The producer apparently thought otherwise . So confident was Harvey that his adversary had at last calmed down that he thought he could afford to say something just to please Reager . " Some of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us courtesy of Miss Evie Reager . " " A Bolex was what she used . " " Yes , indeed , Mr. Reager . They certainly are fine pictures . " " They should be ! She 's got an eye , that girl of mine . I 've asked her to watch this evening and give us the benefit of her criticism . I 'm sure we can all use it , Harvey . She should have been here by now . I do n't know what 's keeping her . "  |p174Diddy  leaned back in the center of the couch , stretched his legs , lit another cigarette . It was going to be a hard evening . After the run-through of Saturday 's program , Reager and his daughter invited everyone back to their house for a nightcap . None of us really wanted to go . Watkins said no with the practiced brusque delivery of a man who 's always been rather sparing with his yes . The junior men , for whom the invitation was in fact intended , hesitated a moment . Diddy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep his voice casual but decisive . Pleading fatigue , he begged off . We left the television studio . Harvey 's car was parked behind the station , so he left us immediately . Watkins ' chauffeured Lincoln Continental was waiting at the curb to carry him away . Evie , explainingthat she 'd had to park two blocks down the street , led the way for what was left of the group . Comensky and Michaelson flanked her father . Diddy , intending to see them as far as the car , brought up the rear . Carrying his panda doll again . " We 'll drop you at your hotel , Harron , " said Reager . To accept the ride would have been prudent : then they would have seen him going into the hotel , headed for rest . Whereas , if he took a cab , the suspicion was bound to cross at least Reager 's wary mind that Diddy was n't tired at all , but just had other , gayer plans for the evening . But Diddy did n't want to ride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or should be , after all he 's gone through . " Thanks , Mr. Reager . I 'll get a cab . " To hell with the old buzzard . Let him think what he likes . " Evie , would you like to have this ? " The stuffed panda . He put the large black and white creature in her arms . Succeeded in finding a taxi almost immediately . When he returned to the Rushland , it was already midnight . Passing the industrious student night clerk with a nod . And with not a thought of staying up until the " City Edition " of the CourierGazettewas dumped at the hotel at two o'clock  |p175Diddy  took another hot bath , gratefully pulled back the freshly changed sheets , and crawled into bed . Tired . But not , he thought , sleepy : assuming that his anxiety over Hester 's operation tomorrow would keep him awake most of the night . He was wrong . Falling asleep turned out to be easy , since in his sleep Diddy could dream of Hester . And think thoughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most anxious sleepless hours . In Diddy 's dream , he 's visiting Hester at the hospital on the eve of her operation . Diddy enters the familiar white room , which in the dream is just as it really is . But Hester is n't wearing the same dark glasses . These frames are square , not oval . And hold lenses of a blacker hue than the ones she always wore ; made of thick celluloidrather than glass . There 's a tiny hole in the center of each lens . Diddy sitting stiffly in the chair near the end of the bed . " New glasses ? " he says stiffly . " New treatment , " Hester replies . " The doctors say I should have been wearing them ever since my condition was diagnosed . " There 's some good news in these odd glasses , Diddy thinks . What is it ? Of course ! The tiny hole in each lens signifies that Hester retains some power of sight . She 's not totally blind . But that 's not the same as being able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along ? Then why did n't she see him leave the compartment last Sunday ? But then Diddy feels apprehensive . Because the new glasses also signify something wrong with Hester that he has n't understood . He 's heard of these glasses before . They 're the kind prescribed for a detached retina . How did that happen to Hester ? Through an injury ? Or an infection ? The similarity of the two lenses indicates that both retinas are detached . But that 's serious . The element of time is crucial if she 's not to become completely blind . As soon as this condition is diagnosed , the patient should be put in a hospital , kept in bed , not allowed to move . Any move might detach the retina further . Until the operation , Hester should be treated like a crate of raw eggs . But if that 's the care she needs , Hester has already undergone great and unnecessary risks . The train ride itself , its high-speed velocity , its rocking and swaying motion . The abrupt stop in thep176tunnel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , Hester had cried out . Then he 'd thought that , being unable to see , she was afraid ; he knew ( now ) it was because her eyes pained her , were coming further unstuck . And worst , and least necessary among all the risks , making love in the lavatory . Why did n't she tell Diddy she was so fragile ? Had he known then what he ( now ) knows , he would never have gone with her to that small room . In her condition , that was nothing less than committing an act of assault . Is that what Hester had been trying to make him do ? As Incardona had provoked him , until Diddy struck him with the crowbar . The two of them , accomplices ? Hester trying to lead Diddy to injure her , or be the agent of her physical injury ? To commit , involuntarily , still another crime ? Diddy cries out in his sleep with despair . Almost flings open his eyes , then falls back into the dream . The scene changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright light flows down , drenching the covered figure on the table , the doctors and nurses in white , the instrument trays on their trolleys , the anaesthetist 's equipment . Diddy above , in the gallery with many other spectators . But not just sitting and watching . He 's standing in an aisle , holding something : a Bolex camera . Taking pictures of the operation . Diddy has some reason to be here among the medical students , though he 's not one himself . And the reason is n't his personal relation with Hester . It 's his job ; he 's a professional photographer . In the dream , Diddy is working for a studio that does legal and medical photography . Footage of operations , to be shown in medical schools for the instruction of students , and in hospitals for interns learning their art ; still photographs of accidents and homicides , to be used as evidence in law suits and in murder trials . ( Now ) , very carefully , he 's photographingHester 's operation . The operation is delicate . Until recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cryo-surgery . A very slender tube containing extremely cold gas is carefully aimed , and the gas fired through the tube . If the surgeon 's aim is accurate , the spike of high-speed gas pierces the front of the eyeball , passes through the water , and strikes thep177rear wall of the eye at the exact spot where the retina is unhinged . The velocity and force of the gas are such that in seconds the loose ends of the retina are glued or welded together . But Hester 's doctor is trained in the newer technique , in which a laser beam is used . The same target , however . And the same principle : assault and puncture at a distance , without hard metal tools , but with gas and light instead . There 's a murder weapon to confound the experts ! The doctor holds the miniature laser in his hands , pointing it like a toy machine gun at Hester 's head . The gun gets closer . Her eyelids held widely apart with clamps . He fires . But there 's no smell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tiny light burning through her eye ? How can the surgeon be sure the light is n't traveling right past the eye , into the brain ? She must be in pain . See how she 's turning restlessly on the table . The doctors continue . Diddy would like to do something , but he 's too far away . So he goes on photographing , his camera clicking . ( Now ) Diddy is back in Hester 's room , sitting by her bed , waiting for her to regain consciousness . Her whole face is swathed in bandages . Diddy wonders if this is necessary . How , when she wakes , will she be able to speak ? To call his name , to ask for a glass of water ? How can she breathe ? And if Diddy ca n't see her face , not only ca n't he have a dialogue with her ; he ca n't even be sure it 's Hester . Already growing on Diddy that it 's not she . That long form under the blankets does n't look like Hester @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , broad in the shoulders and narrow in the hips . Diddy suddenly has a horrible premonition that he 's at the wrong bedside , keeping vigil over the wrong body . He knows whose body it is , too . But just for the moment , the name of the person eludes him . Someone he knows . Rather : knew . For this person is not breathing at all . But then the dream changes , and the body beside whom Diddy sits is clearly Hester 's . She has awakened and cries , " I ca n't see . " Tries to claw the bandages off her face . Doctors and nurses come rushing through the door of her little room , crowd around the nar/row iron bedstead , bend over her solicitously . Diddy is pushed aside . The medical personnel seem to be conferring . Diddy , squashed against the wall near the lavatory , wants to hear . But he 's not allowed . Somehow , though , he knows anyway what the doctors and nurses are saying , without hearing . They 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But I told you so , you idiots ! I told you that before . " Paying no attention to Diddy , the doctors and nurses lift Hester 's limp body on to a wheeled stretcher and take her out of the room . Diddy races after them , down long identicalcorridors . Sometimes the stretcher , with its precious burden and its white attendants , gets out of sight . This is when Diddy panics . He 'll never be able to find Hester 's operating room on his own . There are so many . Where are they ? He 's lost them . Down one more empty corridor , Diddy again catches sight of the ghostly party . Tall wooden doors , like those to Watkins ' chapel at the factory , open to admit the medical team with their patient . Diddy wants to follow , but someone who resembles Comensky bars the way . " You ca n't go in , Harron , " he shouts . " They 're working on Top Secret Classified material in that laboratory . " Diddy pleads , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room ! " Frantically trying to convince Comensky . The man is adamant . But after a while relents somewhat . Though Diddy still ca n't enter , he can peek through the keyhole . Kneeling , presses his left eye against the rectangular metal plate . Like looking through a microscope . On the metal plate there areeven some microscope-like devices that Diddy can adjust . A large knurled wheel which supplies a coarse adjustment : the pinion head . This operates by a rack-andpiniongear and changes the elevation of the tube . Two smaller knobs , one on the right and one on the left , which supply the fine adjustment : the micrometer heads . On the right one a micrometer scale is inscribed so that the exact amount of vertical motion may be determined . This fine adjustment has definite upper and lower limits , and reaching either of which refuses to be turned farther . Movement ceases as soon as the objec/tive touches the cover glass over the specimen , thus preventingdamage to either object or lens . Hester is the specimen beneath Diddy 's eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tube up and down gradually , seeking the most accurate focus . There it is , clear as glass . The view Diddy wants . Hester lying again on the operating table , like a slide on the stage . But there are no students in this amphitheatre , as there were during the other operation . Has entry been barred to them as well ? Apparently , Diddy thinks , these high-and-mighty doctors do n't want their studentsto know when they 've made a mistake . The doctor is doing something with a scalpel to Hester 's eyes . Diddy tries to see , because this must be the important part . But how small Hester looks ! The rest are tiny figures , too . Diddy 's view is slipping out of focus . He turns the pinion head , then the double micrometer head . Moves the knobs slowly at first , then rapidly . But ca n't seem to clear up the trouble . The image is shrinking , becoming indecipherable . " I think I have a defective instrument here , " he says to no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that a microscope , any microscope , is inappropriatefor this kind of scrutiny . And there is n't anyone to say that to . This is a world that loves the small . From his kneeling position , Diddy looks up at Comensky , who is slouching to one side of the door , his arms loosely folded like a bored guard in some rarely visited museum . " Ca n't you tell me anything , you bastard ? " Diddy snarls . " At least tell me what the doctors think it is . " " Corneal opacities , I think , " replies Comensky in a lazy voice . Scratching his scalp . Diddy scrambles to his feet , knocking over the microscope . " But I told them that ! Those doctors had that diagnosis all along . " " Maybe they forgot , " drawls Comensky . " They 've got no right to forget ! " Diddy yells angrily . " It 's sheer cruelty . Why do they make her suffer so ? " Comensky shrugs his shoulders . Now he , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair , features , complexion , build . Looks like that Harvid , Harvid or something , from the televisionp180studio . A new resource . Diddy 's microscope is broken , but other ways of seeing exist . Less diminutive in outlook . " Can I watch the operation on TV ? " Harvid nods , points down the hall . Diddy runs to the room Harvid had indicated , throws open the door , and finds himself in his own room at the Rushland . He switches on his set . All the channels are off . Blank . ( Now ) Diddy knows he 's been tricked . But when he opens the door to leave , it 's the corridor of the hotel he sees . Not the hospital . Really tricked ! How will he ever get back to the Warren Institute , which is miles away ? For suddenly Diddy knows Hester 's in terrible danger . The anaesthetic already administered , her eyeballs slit open with a scalpel , the doctors must operate immediately . But a telegram has just been received in the operating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transplants available today . Wait ! There 's a possible solution . By a great stroke of luck , Diddy happens to know a suitable corpse . Someone recently dead ; someone who was strong and healthy while alive , and is likely to possess a full complement of vigorous organs . If he could obtain Incardona 's eyes and bring them in time to the hospital , Hester 's sight could be saved . A lovely justice in this scheme ; not just necessity . For them the workman 's death would n't have been a completewaste . Diddy the Criminal not wholly culpable . Equipped with Incardona 's eyes , Hester will see again . And through Hester , Incardona will go on living . Diddy will have them both . Diddy rushes to the elevator on the fourth floor of the Rushlandbut it is n't in its right place . No time to look ! Runs to the door marked " Exit , " and hurtles down a long flight of stairs , takingtwo and three steps at a time . It 's so dark . Diddy reminded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself to venture alone into the cook 's closet , the damp cellar , the dark pantry . But no , he must n't go back there ( now ) , to the house in Allentown . That 's even farther from the hospital . The bottom of the stairs . Light ; a door ; Diddy pushes it open . He 's on the street level . But not the street scarred with trolley tracks in front of the Rushland . Is Diddy lost ? Why does n't he have a map ? Diddy remembers how Paul , everyone , had alwaysp181praised his sense of direction . He ca n't have lost that skill , which permits him to figure out fairly easily where he is , wherever he is , including situations where most people get lost . He just has to relax , breathe deeply , not fret or feel sorry for himself . It will come . It does come . This street looks like Manhattan . Oh , Christ ! Broadway and Forty-fourth Street . There 's what 's left of the Astor ; and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then opened and then closed and then opened and ( now ) closed for the last time . Its white , letterless marquee . An ignoble tombstone . Diddy is stranded among drunks and honking cars and whores and tourists . How will Diddy get back upstate , to the funeral parlor to find Incardona and rip the eyes out of the cadaver ? Then to the hospital , to press the bleeding balls of flesh into the surgeon 's waiting hands ? A trip of many hours away . By the time Diddy arrives , the operation will have been called off . Hester dismissed . Returned , sightless forever , to her white room . But the surgeons must n't give up . And Diddy urges himself not to lose heart either . If he just keeps moving , then he 's getting closer . No motion without the abridgment of distance , some distance . He 'll have to catch a train . Perhaps if he runs to the station , the Privateer will be just about to leave . Diddy runs . His chest hurts . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who won a medal in track at college , used to be able to run without tiring . Paul seems to be somewhere in this part of the dream . Maybe telling Diddy to run faster . But that 's easy advice for sedentary Paul , who spends eight hours a day at the piano . On time . The train , but not Diddy . Diddy is late . No time to purchase a ticket . Racing to find a helpful sign , something indicating the right gate or track number . Down a flight of stairs , like flying . The starting signal has been given . An official at the end of the long dirty platform waving a yellow signal light above his head . Diddy kneels down , gets into position , counts One-Two-Three under his breath , then leaps up and sprints down the platform . Past shouting conductors and train officials who want to intercept him , to detain him , to question him . How long it is . Diddy wo n't stop . They 'll have to catch him . The train at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darting back and forth from the platform to the trembling chain of coaches just starting up , Diddy runs down the endless platform toward the last car . Sweating Diddy awoke with all his bedclothes fallen on the floor . His wristwatch curled up on the night table beside the bed : fourthirty . He could hardly catch his breath . Diddy still tired . But apprehensive about falling back to sleep . Maybe the ugly dream would be resumed , like the second act of a play after a brief smoke in the lobby . Wiser , perhaps , to get up , take a shower to wipe the sweat and grime of his ordeal off his body , and do some work . Duva wanted a detailed report on the conference from him . Quite properly , Diddy had planned to write this after the conference had adjourned . Say , this Sunday . But what were the chances that anything of note was going to happen today , the last day ? Slight . Diddy can just as well write it ( now ) . The first draft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll dare to use his Olivetti . Which is what Diddy did . Finishing only a few moments before it was time to go down for the limousine . Puts stamps on the envelope , leaves it at the reception desk to be mailed to New York . Diddy finding it particularly hard to sit through Friday 's meeting . Not only because it was the last ; apparently set aside for redundant summings-up of what had already been decided , and for the usual tributes to leading participants and displays of company chauvinism . Also because Diddy has decided to be utterly silent . Having already written his report of the conference and formulated his recommendations , he had no intention of saying a word ( now ) that might provoke someone into making a new suggestion . Which might mean writing a postscript to his report . Nothing must happen at the plant . Everyone must be quite lifeless and speak only cardboardwords , so that Diddy may escape intact to Hester . He left the meeting as early as he could , arriving at the hospital at four-thirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to last for at least two hours . But as he approached the head nurse 's office to inquire if the operation had started on time , he caught sight of the loathsome aunt hurrying down the hall toward him , her arms waving stiffly . Diddy knew instantly that things were already over , and had gone badly . " Oh , Dalton dear ! How glad I am to see you ! Our poor darling is already back in her room , resting . She 's still under the anaesthetic , and we wo n't be able to see her until this evening . Dr. Collins says there 's nothing to worry about . She 's a mighty healthy girl , he says . Only  --  " the woman faltered . " I understand , " said Diddy grimly . " Do you ? " " Of course I do ! You 're telling me the operation was unsuc-cessful . " Mrs. Nayburn simply stared , opened her mouth as if to speak , then closed it again . She was taking a handkerchief from her purse to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doctors always were a little pessimistic . Still , I was so sure they 'd find a way . And then , after only an hour , Dr. Collins gave up . Only an hour ! " " What did he say ? " said Diddy roughly . " That there 's nothing medical science knows at this time that can help her , and that she never had more than a fifty-fifty chance . Oh , why did we ever bother ? Raising our hopes like that ! It is n't fair . " Diddy refused to console the woman , who seemed far sorrier for herself than for Hester . Would save his sympathy for the person who deserved it . " And the bills ! Dalton , you have no idea how much this is costingher grandfather and me . And to think it was all for nothing ! " Diddy was heading for the elevator , speechless with sorrow and rage . The woman scurrying along to keep up with his long strides . " The bills .... " Well , it was easier to speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone wall . At the elevator , Diddy turned on the aunt and looked at her sternly . " Mrs. Nayburn , I intend to help with Hester 's hospital expenses . So please stop fretting about that . "  | " You do ? " said the woman in an incredulous tone that was partly feigned , partly genuine . The small sharp eyes that Diddy hated , widening . " May I ask why ? " " You know perfectly well . Because I want to marry Hester , if she 'll have me . " Diddy paused to let the woman play with her face and try on several different reactions . She started with " Why , Dalton ! " Then quickly realized surprise was the wrong tack . Without transition , she switched to reassurance . " What do you mean , will she have you ? Of course she will ! " Diddy making his face as stern as he could , so Mrs. Nayburn would understand that approach was wrong , too . She settled , finally , for affectionate sagacity . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Well , then , it was for a good purpose that the good Lord brought us here . He did n't choose to restore my baby 's sight . But he did find her a wonderful husband . " The elevator opened . " I hope Hester thinks so . Please excuse me , I have to return to work . Tell her I 'll be back . " The woman 's jaw dropped . Two desires . One , to follow Diddy into the elevator , to continue this extraordinary conversation . The other , to hurry to her niece 's room , drag her by the hair out of her anaesthetized sleep , and pour out the news of Diddy 's intentions . The result of Mrs. Nayburn 's being torn between the two impulses was that she did nothing . Stilled ligaments , a bleached will . Could n't take a step . Just stared at Diddy open-mouthed , as the elevator door closed . Stood , gaping , even after the car had started down the shaft . Diddy , observing the spell he 'd cast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily . The outsized elevator car descended smoothly . The doors parted with a faint whirring of rubber . No familiar faces waiting for him in the lobby of the hospital . Diddy was free . It was raining . Diddy began to feel chilled after walking several blocks . He was n't free , he was just outside . And sorry ( now ) he 'd spoken so bluntly and then left , since that meant Hester would first hear from her aunt of his impending proposal . Having let him get away , the woman would have no other thought but to return to Nester'sbedside . Stationing herself there until the first vague stirring of the girl 's body indicates that her mind was surfacing . Comingp185awake , awake enough to hear the news . If only Hester were deaf , like a snake . So she could n't hear her aunt 's raspy voice . Instead of blind , like those primitive species of fish that inhabit underground lakes in dark caves . Would n't Mrs. Nayburn 's crass enthusiasm contaminate his proposalin Hester 's eyes ? Bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . He had faith in the girl 's independence of spirit . Hester was aware of her aunt 's crassness and insincerity . Certainly , she must have known for some time how shamelessly eager Mrs. Nayburnwas to get her off her hands . Diddy refused to consider that Hester might imagine that he , Diddy , was made of equally coarse cloth . That his proposal might be fired by emotions of the same venal quality , though different in aim and method than her aunt 's . What he thought most likely was that Hester would simply mistrusthis intelligence . Thinking that he could n't distinguish between pity or benevolence and love , she would try to save him from herself . He would try to save her for himself , more vehemently . Diddy has faith in the adequacy of his powers of persuasion , believed that he could n't fail to convince Hester . Because ( now ) it was different . He had already convinced himself . Still raining . Diddy , bareheaded , walking along a street near the Warren Institute . He could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour to run . Should have gone back . The prudent thing to do . His abrupt departure , though covered by a plausible excuse , obviously had not sat well with his superiors . Diddy had always been a poor liar . Hated lying . When he attempted it , a combination of cowardice and pride always made him , somehow , transparent . They must have seen he was n't really ill . Does n't matter . What his bosses think of him was unimportant . The important thing was that , if only Hester will turn to him , a new life might begin . Diddy the Daring will take the risk of the unknown . He clasps the idea of Hester to him . Having no doubt that he loved her . And anything that might lead Hester to love him he would welcome . No scruples of pride there . If her knowing herself ( now ) to be permanently condemned to blindness enhanced his suit , so much the better . How lucky he isp186that she had so few choices . For if the choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he had little doubt what she would choose . But if Diddy had n't been thinking at this moment how Hester 's blindness and her consequent need for a reliable and loving protectorfavored his courtship , would he then have regretted her being blind ? On her behalf , yes . The truth is , Diddy does n't really think of Hester as being blind . In the sense that the world is divided into two camps : the fortunate majority with normal eyesight , and the tiny minority of the blind . The world is not so simple . Diddy saw eyes everywhere . Everyone has some kind of eyes . There are the squinty-eyed , the fish-eyed , the dragon-eyed , the piercing-eyed , the wolf-eyed . And the no-eyed and the all-eyed . The no-eyed not to be confused with the blind . And besides their number and qualitiesand uses , eyes may be distinguished by their composition . Some people 's eyes are made of water ; others of vapor ; and others of crystalline splinters . Diddy thought his own eyes might be made of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hester 's eyes were made of the same soft flesh as her sex . For him , she had seeing eyes , and always had . All over her body . Like those animals such as the frog and the guinea pig and the rat , whose skin is rich in the pigment melanin ; making the entire surface of their bodies responsiveto light . Like that Russian girl with extra-ocular vision recentlydiscovered by scientists , who can read  --  slowly  --  with her elbow . Were it within Diddy 's powers to make Hester see , he would . But he could also be grateful that the operation this afternoon changed nothing . Leaving her sight and the rest of her health exactly as they were before . Leave everything as it is . Just walk in the rain . So Diddy will not go back to the conference . He will stroll and daydream for an hour . Afterwards , get some coffee . And then return to the hospital . As soon as she gets out of the hospital , they would return to New York . After that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and casual  --  at least Diddy hoped Hester would agree to that , hoped she wanted to be free of her aunt 's supervision . When would they marry ? So deep wasp187Diddy 's feeling for Hester ( now ) , and so powerful his wish to secure the tie between the girl and himself as strongly as possible , that he would like nothing better than to have the ceremony performed in the hospital . This week . Or downtown , at City Hall , the day she was discharged . For that speed , he 'd even put up with having Mrs. Nayburn as godmother and witness . But perhaps Hester would n't want to be rushed . Do n't ! Diddy would count himselfblessed if she consented to live with him on a trial basis . So Mrs. Nayburn would be packed off , and Diddy and Hester would live together , marry legally whenever Hester was willing . But where would they live in New York ? His apartment was too small . Not an apartment . Diddy would try to borrow money for the down payment on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or perhaps , even cheaper , an old frame house on the fringe of Chinatownsuch as one he 'd once gotten a rental agent to show him . Hester would know every inch of that house . Without having to extend her arms to keep from colliding with doors and walls and furniture . She would never bruise herself . More rain . Diddy is getting drenched . There 's hardly anyone on the street ( now ) . Does Hester like to walk in the rain ? Diddy does n't know yet . He stops in a phone booth to call the hospital . Gertrude , the head nurse on the floor , who knows Diddy by ( now ) , tells him Miss Nayburn is still unconscious . She should be awake by eight . He can come for just a few minutes ' visit then . It 's only six o'clock now . Time for more walking , and cups of coffee , two cheeseburgers , a slice of pie , another cheeseburger . By seven-thirty , Diddy is almost lost somewhere in the neighborhood . The sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seven-thirty already . Perhaps she 's regained consciousness already . He hurries back to the hospital . No one stops him at the nurse 's desk . Diddy races down the hall , then stops before the room . His heart is thumping loudly . And softly opens the door . Hester is awake , though lying flat on her back without any pillows . Mrs. Nayburn is by the bedside whispering . As Diddy comes in , he 's aghast at the pallor of that half of her face not masked by the thick white bandages . He rushes top188the far side of the bed , leans over , and touches her cheek with his lips . " How do you feel ? " She smiles wistfully . " Does it hurt ? " She motions no with her hand . " Can you talk ? " " Yes . " Diddy , burning , leans across the bed . " Mrs. Nayburn , would you please leave us alone for a few minutes ? " " Why ? " the girl whispers . " Hester ! " Diddy pleads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'll do whatever you say , lovey . I certainly never meant to be in anyone 's way . " Diddy 's no longer to be humored . His proposal blurted out , he 's already to be taken for granted . " Hester ! " The girl strokes her aunt 's hand . " Yes . For just a few minutes . " Mrs. Nayburn rises with a sigh . " Do n't get her overexcited , Dalton , " she says as she leaves the room . Diddy waits to hear the footsteps growing fainter as she moves down the corridor . Hears nothing . So she 's just outside . Still , there 's a door between . " Hester , am I being very selfish ? Was I cruel just now ? It 's just that I had to be with you alone . " She reaches up to touch his hand . " It 's raining , and you 've been walking . For a long time ? " " Hours . Ever since I came at four-thirty , and they would n't let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and seen me earlier . When I woke up about a half hour ago , Aunt Jessie was right outside the door . " " Hester , do n't reproach me . You 're right . But the thought of spending several hours in that woman 's company , while I was waiting for you , was intolerable . I had to go out . " " I feel sorry for her , " the girl says in a strange weak voice Diddy has never heard before . " For God 's sake , Hester , stop thinking about her for a moment . Tell me how you feel . Are you in physical pain ? " " I ache all over , I guess from the anaesthetic . Otherwise , I do n't know . No , I do n't think I 'm in pain . " " What about your . . . face . Your eyes . "  | " No . I feel nothing there . " " And how do you feel inside ? " " I do n't know . " " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sad all along . You know that I knew the operation would n't work . " " One more thing . Very important . Did your aunt tell you anything about what I said to her when I came this afternoon ? " " Yes , she told me you want to marry me . " Diddy straightened up slightly from the uncomfortable position he 'd adopted , in which he is leaning over Hester , his head above hers , his elbows and forearms resting on the mattress on either side of her head , the upper half of his body close but careful not to press on hers . She 'd spoken ( now ) of what was most important to him , their future together ; but in such an odd , remote way . Maybe he should never have brought the matter up . Saved it for tomorrow , when she would be stronger . Still , he could n't bear to pull away altogether . Without knowing more of what she felt or , at least , could feel ( now ) . " Were you surprised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No . " Well , your telegram last night . . . . " Hester 's voice faded out . Diddy should stop asking questions . Oh , please ! Only one more . " Are you glad ? " " I 'm not sure . " Diddy 's limbs stiffen . " Not sure of what ? Not sure you can be happy with me ? " " Oh , " the girl says wearily . " I can be happy with almost anyone , I think . It depends on me , whether I 'm happy within myself . " " But you were n't happy living with your aunt ? Yes or no ? " " No , I was n't happy . " " Will you leave her and live with me ? " " I 'll try . " Diddy , speechless with joy , lowers his face and kisses Hester 's cheek . Is that all , really all ? Is there no special eloquence needed ? Nothing more he has to say ? Not really . But Diddy about to say something anyway . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her voice so low he has to strain to hear it . " What , my love ? "  | " Can we call Aunt Jessie back now ? She must be waiting out-side . " Are those the words that follow ? Diddy ca n't help feeling hurt . " Do n't you want to be alone with me , Hester ? For just a few minutes ? " " I ca n't be alone with anyone right now . I 'm too tired , and I feel as if I 've been sliced into a thousand pieces . Do n't you see , Dalton , there is n't one person here for you to be alone with ? So you must n't be jealous of my aunt . " " I 'll try not to be . " He 's been clumsy , overbearing with his tenderness . Who is Diddy to insist that he 's better for Hester than her aunt ? He held the door open for Mrs. Nayburn . The woman walked stiffly to her niece 's bedside ; began whispering to the girl . Diddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women to ignore him . The door opens again , to admit just the head of one of the nurses . " Visiting hours are over . Come back tomorrow . " Diddy stepped over to the bed , brought Hester 's right hand to his lips , said a husky good night to Mrs. Nayburn , and stepped rapidly into the hallway corridor . Once out in the street , Diddy looks at his watch . Five minutes after eight . He 's missed most of the cocktail party from seven to nine o'clock at the Green Room of the Congress Hotel : biggest hotel in the city and four blocks from the Rushland . But has ( now ) really no excuse for not turning up at the company 's banquet to celebrate the end of the conference . Nine o'clock in the Terrace Room of the Congress . No point in offending Reager and Watkins , with whom he 'll have to spend tomorrow morning doing the televisionprogram . Diddy gets in a cab , returns to the Rushland , shaves again and changes his suit , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pretending not to notice Jim , signaling him from one of the long tables that he 's saved Diddy a seat . Diddy finds a seat near some men in the production department whom he scarcely knows , and managed to eat most of his dinner without speaking either to his neighbor on the right or to his neighbor on the left . Diddy , hungry ,  |p191entertains  the fantasy that he 's eating for Hester , who 's probably on liquid nourishment ; as well as for himself . He 'll be strong for both of them tonight . Saturday noon , after " Your Community , " Diddy is outside the two-story building that houses Channel 10 . Shaking hands with Watkins , Reager , and the others . Receiving their compliments on his performance at the conference , particularly his contributions during the early sessions . And their wishes for a pleasant trip back to New York . Diddy forces himself to be silent . " Taking the plane or a train , Harron ? " asks Watkins . " Train . " " Take the Privateer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train betweenhere and New York . No train does that trip as fast . It leaves here at two-forty , so you should have plenty of time to make it . " " I know the train , " said Diddy . Feeling bold . " I came up on it . " The temptation to talk about the events at the beginning of the week has subsided . It 's not the story of Incardona which swells up in Diddy 's throat , rises , then thrusts itself behind his teeth . Pushing to come out . The words that want to spill through Diddy 's mouth ( now ) concern the future . We all look rather genial this morning . Diddy feels his soul is lacquered with milk . It would be a pleasure to tell his bosses and colleagues what he really intends . Do n't . What use would that be ? Diddy returns to the Rushland , and first stops off at the desk . Instructs the clerk to prepare his bill . Then he goes up to his room , and packs his suitcase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ station to catch the Privateer . Is he insane ? No . Diddy carries his suitcase downstairs , pays his bill , goes outside the hotel , and has a cab hailed . Once inside , he tells the driver to drive to the Warren Institute . " What I really mean is around the Institute . " Asks if he can recommend a decent hotel in that neighborhood.  | " I 'd try the Canada , " says the driver . " Unless you 're looking for something real cheap . " Fine , says Diddy . Let 's go . Passing Monroe Park , high afternoon , Saturday , November ( now ) , the day after a rain . Yesterday 's rain and wind have practically swept the remaining autumn leaves from the trees . Single with shower and bath ? In less than an hour Diddy unpacked and installed . One bed , and a larger room than he had at the Rushland . Pleasanter , too , than the other hotel , because ( now ) he 's out of the center of town . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And beyond the park , Diddy can see two towers of cream-colored stone , the principal buildings of the Warren Institute . Two-thirty . Diddy calls the hospital , is told he can visit Hester briefly around six o'clock . Time for a two-hour nap . Leaving time enough to accomplish one more piece of business . At five-fifteen Diddy sits at the small glass-topped desk opposite the foot of his bed ; writes another letter to Duva , requesting a sick leave . During the week of the conference , Diddy explains , he has undergone a series of tests at the Warren Institute to try to learn more about his old virus infection which had laid him low again just a month ago . This morning has gotten the reports on the tests ; and the doctors have prescribed a course of treatment to effect a permanent cure of the recurring infection , for which approximately ten days ' hospitalizationis required . Diddy will need to remain upstate for at least another two weeks . Downstairs . Diddy buys a stamp from a machine and puts the letter in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drugstore on the corner . Walks across the park . The sun has already set , and the park is practically empty . Notices two little girls , about eight and ten , on the swings . Bright , strong , fleshy , seeing children such as he and Hester will have one day . As he enters Hester 's room , Mrs. Nayburn starts up awkwardly . " Be back in a few minutes , lovey . " And darts out of the room . Diddy standing near Hester 's bed , ill at ease . " How are you ? " " Stronger . " She 's propped up again on the pillows . Good.  |p193He  sits next to the bed , in the chair which the aunt has just hastily vacated ; still warm from her body . Hester does n't say anything more . Nor , when Diddy takes her hand , does her flesh seem very alive . He fears she 's angry with him for Mrs. Nayburn 's departure . " Darling , I 'm sorry for what happened now . Sorry , I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've made your aunt unhappy . " Hester turns toward Diddy . The thick white bandages cover so much more of her face than the dark glasses did . He 's vaguely alarmed that ( now ) he ca n't read her expression at all . " But you do understand how I feel , do n't you ? " Diddy continues . " I 'm so eager for us to be alone . " " I 'm afraid we 'll be too much alone when we live together . You may hate that . " " Never , " Diddy says ardently . " Try me . " " I will , " said the girl , " try . " " That 's all I ask . " " But you must remember that I warned you . " " I promise to remember . " Diddy wanted to hold her , but she looked so thin and fragile . He senses something wrong . A different sadness from yesterday . " What 's the matter , darling ? " " Did you come to say goodbye ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you talking about ? " " Are n't you going back to New York now ? Is n't the conference over ? " " Sure , the conference is over . The last thing I had to do was this morning . But that does n't mean I 'm going . You do n't know me , Hester . I 'm staying right here . So I can see you every day . In fact , I 've moved out of my hotel downtown this afternoon and taken a room nearby . I can even see the hospital buildings from my win-dow . " " How long can you stay on ? " " I 'm staying until you leave . Until you leave this room and go down that elevator , and we walk out of here together . Which reminds me . After they kick me out of here this afternoon , I want to go and find your doctor and see how long he wants you to remain in the hospital . Has anyone given you a date yet ? " " Two or three weeks , Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after you 're discharged , whenever you feel strong enough to travel , we 'll go back to New York . " " But how can you stay up here ? " Hester exclaims plaintively . It sounded like tears , filling those poor wounded eyes behind the thick bandages . " You 'll lose your job , Dalton . " " Leave it to me , " said Diddy soothingly . " I 've thought of a good excuse already . After eleven years , I 'm not going to be fired for taking a couple of weeks ' leave of absence . " " But then , when we get to New York , you 'll go back to your job ? Right ? " " Honestly , I do n't know . " Which is the truth . Already , Diddy not sure he ever intends to return to Watkins &; Company . The prospect of leaving Hester alone in the apartment each day while he goes to an office seems unthinkable . Her physical safety , for one thing . And Diddy 's sheer possessiveness , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't underestimate that . Not having any private income , he will need to work to support them both . There must be some job he could do at home . But all that can be settled later . No need to rush to a decision . While he and Hester get settled in New York , he may need his old job . Hence , his letter of this afternoon . This decision is the decision to stall . " You 've never lived in New York , have you ? " The girl shook her head . " You might not like it . The air is filthy , strangers are rude , even nasty , there 's a lot of noise . But the city may please you or interest you anyway . And if it does n't , we 'll move elsewhere . To another city , or to a small town . Or out of the country altogether . " " Can you do that ? Are you rich ? " " No , " said Diddy . " But I can always manage . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guy . " Knocking on the door . And the aunt 's voice , asking querulously if she should come in ( now ) . " One more minute , Mrs. Nayburn . " " Dalton , you should n't do that . Let her in . " But this time Hester was smiling slightly . Diddy took heart . " Darling , I will . But you must promise to urge your aunt to go home within a few days . I want to be the onep195to take care of you , understand . I 've already told Mrs. Nayburn that I would contribute as much as I could to your hospital bills . I wish I could pay for the whole thing . So , please tell her soon to go . Promise me that . " " I promise . " Hester lifts her mouth for Diddy 's kiss . Then Diddy went to the door , and opened it . Mrs. Nayburn , red-eyed , weeping , her gray hair untidier than ever , was swaying on the other side of the threshold . Suddenly , Diddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the woman , and how petty he 'd been in himself . She was never a person to him , just a creature . Something looked at under a microscope . Not seeing that she really loved Hester , truly suffered over her . Why had he been so spiteful ? So possessive since the first moment he saw Hester ? Already on the train , from the beginning , he 'd aimed to take complete possession of the girl . Which required caricaturing the aunt , and trying to discredither with Hester . " Forgive me ! " The tears he should have wept yesterday , after the failure of Hester 's operation , flooded Diddy 's eyes . Opening his arms to the elderly woman , he embraced her . " Forgive me . " The relief and exaltation of tears wept in concert . Like the joys of common interests . Diddy wishes Hester could see them next to her bed , he with his arm around Mrs. Nayburn 's shoulder . But drowsy as she is , she must know what 's happening . Minutes later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announcement that our patient 's too weak to have any more visiting that evening . Diddy , leaning over Hester 's bed to kiss her goodbye , whispers that he will take Mrs. Nayburn out to dinner and devote the rest of the evening to her . Hester nods . Suddenly she does seem too tired even to speak . When they leave the hospital , Diddy is busy looking for a cab . Does n't notice that the aunt is crying again . When he does , the words sound wrong . " Please do n't . We must n't be any less brave than Hester is. "  | " I know , " wailed the woman . " I just ca n't help myself . " In the cab , Diddy gives the address of a steak house downtown . " You have n't really seen the city yet , have you , Mrs. Nayburn ? " " No , " she whimpers . " I just go back and forth from the hospital to the rooming house . " Diddy accepted the reproach graciously . " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Putting his arm around her shoulder . " You know , I 'd like to call you Jessie . It would help me feel closer to you . " " That 's nice , Dalton . Or you could call me Aunt Jessie . " " Maybe I will some day . I do n't have any living aunts . I had one once , though , whom I liked very much . She was my father 's sister , Anne , but I did n't even know her name until I was grown up . From the way I heard the adults pronounce it , I 'd always thought her name was Aunt Dan . " Mrs. Nayburn 's face was clearer ( now ) . " What happened to her ? " " Ran away to California with a married high-school teacher in our town when I was nine . My father and mother never mentioned her again , and later I heard that she 'd died . " " Families are a wonderful thing , " sighed Mrs. Nayburn . " Well , " said Diddy almost laughing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that . " When Mrs. Nayburn did n't make the conventional protest , and even smiled faintly at what he 'd said , Diddy felt immenselyrelieved . If he had n't actually misjudged her , she was n't as simple and predictable as he 'd thought . In front of Cavanaugh 's . " I think you 'll like this place , Jessie . " " I 'm not very hungry . " " You will be , you 'll see . " Appetite comes with eating , does n't it ? Diddy will set the good example . Clam chowder , a sirloin done medium for Mrs. Nayburn and rare for Diddy , salad with Roquefort dressing , hot apple pie , and coffee . That 's not exactly not being hungry . Mrs. Nayburn is a greedy eater . But if the woman 's mouth is busy with food most of the time , Diddy , habitually slow and fastidious at the table , has the advantage . Can do most of the talking himself this meal . " Goodness , I did n't know I was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gray hair from the corner of her mouth . " I told you so . Now you 'll start feeling better . " Diddy , remem/bering Mrs. Nayburn 's bulging bags of food on the train , senses something unpleasant in his stomach . Which he strives to fight down . " Are n't you hungry , Dalton ? It 's a shame to waste such a good meal . " " Do n't worry about me . I always dawdle over my food . " He took a forkful of salad . " My mother used to say I was the slowest eater she 'd ever seen . " Why this impulse to bring up his family at the slightest pretext ? " Your mother is dead , is n't she , Dalton dear ? " Another mouthful . " Yes . She died when I was in college . But we were never very close . I really liked my father much better . " He must stop talking about himself . Idle chatter : a facile way of putting this woman , with whom he was about to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mrs. Nayburn is cutting up large chunks of steak two at a time , each demanding a good deal of earnest chewing . Here 's Diddy 's opportunity to ask his questions , not just volunteer random information or answer Mrs. Nayburn'squeries . Serious questions , about Hester . Engrossed by the excellent meal , wearied by her recent expenditure of emotion , the naturally talkative woman is quieter . Subdued , stripped of some of her exasperating mannerisms . Even when she speaks , it 's with more gravity . Seems ( now ) almost capable of the truth . What Diddy is most eager to know about is Hester 's parents . All he 's been told is that Mrs. Nayburn is the widow of her father 's brother , and that Hester 's father left his family when she was twelve . Became a uranium prospector in New Mexico , disappeared from sight years ago . But what about her mother ? Whom neither Hester nor her aunt had ever mentioned . Diddy asked . Then saw that he 'd trespassed on something painful . Mrs. Nayburn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a strange , imploring way . Was the mother dead ? " No , not dead . " Began chewing again , more slowly . " Where is she ? Does Hester ever see her ? " How impossible to drop that word . Mrs. Nayburn took up her fork and knife to cut into the steak ,  |p198then  set them down . " Hester has n't seen her mother in many years . " " Where does she live ? " " Dalton , I do n't think I want any more . Would you like to finishthis piece ? " Diddy stopped eating , too . " Jessie , where is Hester 's mother ? " " This steak is tough . " " Jessie , where is Hester 's mother ? " In his sternest voice . Reluctantpeople must sometimes be forced to divulge their secrets . Mrs. Nayburn lowered her eyes . " In a hospital . " " A mental hospital , you mean . " The woman nodded . " For how long ? " " I think I want my coffee now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Signaling the waiter . " When was Hester 's mother put away ? " " A long time ago . " Diddy told the waiter to bring them their coffee ( now ) . " Wait , " said the woman fretfully , as soon as he 'd left . " Change the order . Coffee will keep me awake . " " Tea ? " Diddy trying to catch the waiter 's eye again , without slackening the heavy stare he was imposing on Mrs. Nayburn . " Oh , I do n't know . Maybe I wo n't have anything . " " The lady is changing her order to tea . I 'm still having coffee . " Now , his full gaze upon her again . " Jessie , I wo n't let you put me off . I have a right to know about what concerns Hester . Now , stop stalling and tell me how long she 's been in an asylum ? " " Since Hester was fourteen . " The woman looked away , apprehensively . Something dark surged forth in Diddy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fourteen , is n't that right ? You told me that the other day . " " Yes . . . . Dalton , let 's change the subject . " " Then there 's a connection . " Diddy the Persistent . " Between her mother and Hester 's blindness . You 've just admitted it . " " That 's something I do n't want to talk about . " The woman 's face took on a hostile , childish look . As much as declaring , in the words of childhood 's chant , That 's for me to know and you to find out ? Or registering something truly serious ? " But I must know ! If you do n't tell me , I 'm afraid I wo n't bep199able to keep from questioning Hester . And if it 's painful for you to speak of the past , imagine how much more painful it will be for her . Tell me now , and I promise never to bring it up again . " The woman was spooning four lumps of sugar into her tea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " For God 's sake , Jessie ! " cried Diddy , in anguish . " Do n't play games at a moment like this . How do I know ? " " Well , think ! " Bitterly . " What 's the most horrible thing you can think of ? " Diddy ca n't help realizing how ironic is that command to put his imagination to work . Does n't he do little else these days but summonup the most horrible things he can think of ? What could the awful story be ? One possibility : when the mother had become insane , Hester had succumbed to a fit of mad adolescent guilt ; either deliberately or inadvertently , had blinded herself . He said it very slowly . Mrs. Nayburn shook her head . " No , not that . Something even worse . " Then Diddy knew . The mother had blinded her . " How horrible . " Was there anything else to say ? " But why did she do such a thing ? " Diddy feeling very remote from his words . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his thought . Mrs. Nayburn shook her head . " I suppose we all should have seen it coming . She was so unhappy after Hester 's father left her . Then everybody was saying that Stella was crazy . But we did n't mean it . And the idea of her harming the child never crossed anyone'smind . She seemed to adore Hester . Always kissing and huggingher , calling the child her beautiful angel . That was the main reason we were sure things would stay on an even keel with Stella . She acted so devoted to Hester , and seemed so responsible . Overdidit , actually . Worrying about her all the time . About the littlest scratch or cut . Or when Hester would be a few minutes late from school . And then , it was when my husband and I had left for a week to visit relatives in Denver , one day . . . she did it . Just like that . With lye . And she seemed to know afterwards just what she did , mentioned it often , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about a trial , but finally they just put her away . " Diddy had hardly touched his coffee . He could hear Mrs. Nayburntalking . He could even decode the words , and encode some of his own . For instance : " Where was Hester all this time ? " But all the while there is this terrible iron pain speeding toward him . " Oh , Dalton , that was heartbreaking , too . Hester was in the Children'sHospital for a whole month . With those awful bandages on her eyes . Being so brave . Just like now . . . . And every day , when my husband and I would visit her , she 'd plead with us to go to the police and tell them she did n't mind what her mother had done . Just so they would n't keep Stella locked up . Worrying and worrying about her mother , not herself . " Diddy was silent for several moments . Submerged , grappling with a curious absence of mind . Seeing a smaller version of the Hester he knows ( now ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the dreadful Gothic scenario projecting itself inside his head . The woman with disheveled clothes , hair streaming about her face , the light of madness in her eyes . Advancing toward her daughter , bottle of vile chemical in her hand . Hester , asleep in her bed . Or , with her back to her mother , at the kitchen table doing her homework . The Advance . The Assault . The Screams . The Police . The Jail . The Hospital . Whenever he thinks he 's understood and registered all the crueltyof living , all the horrors of which people are capable , there are more . Too much to digest . Diddy , still silent , struggling to say something . " You said it happenedwhen you and your husband were on a trip . Do you mean that Hester and her mother were living with you then ? " " That 's right . In the same house , for about two years . After George left for New Mexico , my husband and I had taken them both in . " She began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tea  | " Oh , Dalton , I should n't say my husband and I. " Took a handkerchieffrom her bag , and blew her reddened nose . " I do n't deserveany of the credit , not one bit . It was my husband 's idea , God rest his soul . He . . . he never liked George very much , always disapproved of the way he lived . Maybe he just wanted to show his brother up to the world for the kind of man he really was . And that 's why he took on the responsibility for the wife and child George had abandoned . " " You do n't really think that 's all there was to your husband 's decision , Mrs. Nayburn , " said Diddy gently . " I can hear in your voice that you think of your husband as a good , generous man . " " He was , " said the woman , sighing . " I guess it 's awful of me to say he helped them out for that reason . But I did think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole scheme . Fought and begged and cried . I suppose I was a little jealous of Stella , too , because she was so . . . beautiful . Yes , I was jealous . I used to imagine my husband was interested in her , and maybe had always been waiting for George to clear out so he could make a play for George 's wife . ... Then there was little Hester , too . I had lots of bad feelings inside me because of not having any children of my own . Maybe I would have welcomed a baby , a little thing that I could mother . But Hester was already twelve when she came to us , and so stuck on her mother she did n't have any use for me . Though maybe that was my fault , too . She really was a very loving child . Exceptionallyso . But I 'd hardened my heart against children . When the two of them came to live with us , I did n't see anything special in Hesterat first . I used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't even think she was pretty . But my husband was crazy about her . So was Stella , of course . At least we thought so . So was everybody . Everybodyloved that child . So after a while I came to love her just as much as the others . " Diddy did n't know what to say . " And she 's lived with you ever since ? " " Except for when she was in a special school for the blind in Chicago . That was , let 's see , just the last two years of high school . She graduated at eighteen and then came home to me . " Diddy wondering if in that boarding school Hester first madep202love . With other students or with her teachers ? Or with some of both ? And what pleasures did she provide for herself after returning to live with her aunt ? A blind girl could n't stroll on the streets late at night , when her aunt was in bed . But that was n't necessary . Mrs. Nayburn , who worked at the Public Library @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hester could make assignations by phone , and receive her paramours in her own house . Certainly , the girl was experienced sexually . Suggesting not only promiscuity , which Diddy would n't mind if it were exclusively a thing of the past . Suggesting , too , that Hester might have a very detached temperament , affectionate but not loyal . Because of her blindness incapable of settling down with one man : renouncing chance adventuresand the touch of others . Because she was blind , Diddy felt awkward even speculating to himself about her erotic life . Would be tongue-tied if it came to questioning her directly about it . Blindness a kind of coercion of others ; obliging Diddy to be blind , too . For all Diddy knew , she could have been carrying on this week with Dr. Collins or one of the interns . Diddy , not usually a morbidlysuspicious lover , imagining himself ringed by invisible rivals . But different ( now ) . A girl as willful and spontaneous as Hester , who had made love with him only minutes after they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something like that . The attentive touch of a physician during an examination could easily become a prelude to bed . Hester need only sigh , or make one brief voluptuousmovement . What healthy man , even if engaged in his professionalduties , could resist such an invitation ? He would hardly need the extra stimulus of panic and guilt , and the anguished need to reach out for another person , as Diddy had last Sunday afternoonon the Privateer . Diddy wanted to become Hester 's protector , not her jailer . And not , God knows , her dupe . Diddy sipped his cold coffee , signaled the waiter to refill their glasses of water . Really because he still did n't know how to continue the conversation . Something about a school in Chicago . Nothing to add to that . But he could n't keep silent , because of thep203danger that his face was betraying him to Mrs. Nayburn 's anxious gaze . That he looked ( now ) as unhappy as he felt . " I wonder if Hester can be happy with me . " As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Delivered in what he rated a casual , musing tone . But immediately Diddy saw he 'd made a tactical error . His remark did n't reassure , though it was n't honest either . Mrs. Nayburn looking anxious , as if she feared Diddy was backing off from his marriage proposal . " Oh , but she 's the sweetest-tempered girl in the world , Dalton . Everyone says that , and how pretty she is . But you  --  " she paused . " What ? " " You are n't getting any silly ideas about what I told you before ? You remember that I did n't want to tell you , but you made me . Of course , I do n't believe in lying , either . Heavens , not to someone who 's about to become a member of the family . That was my problem . But about Hester 's mother .... I mean , Dalton , no one else in Hester 's family , either on her mother or her father 's side , has ever been crazy . I swear it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking of that . " Patting the woman'shand reassuringly . " I spoke awkwardly just now . It 's only that Hester is a very complicated person , as I 'm sure you know . She keeps a great deal within herself  --  " The waiter brought the glasses of water . Diddy ordered another coffee , another tea . The woman impatient to get Diddy 's attention again . " Heavens , that 's true enough . Why , sometimes the child hardly says a word to me for days . But she 's not sulking or cross then , believe me . Just quiet . " " Sugar , Jessie ? " " Thank you , dear ... Dalton , tell me what you 're thinking . " " Jessie , nobody could think better of Hester than I do . Do n't defend her  --  as if I were criticizing her , or about to . I 'm not . I 'm just trying to understand her . " What particularly preoccupied Diddy was Hester 's mistrust . Easy to understand , in the light of the hideous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A child is supposed to trust his parents ,
