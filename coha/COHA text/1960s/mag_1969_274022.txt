After a year marked by turmoil and siege on campus , it is little wonder that Columbia University - without a president for much of that time - has been unable to find a willing candidate for the post . John Gardner , former Secretary of Health , Education and Welfare , showed no interest when overtures were made . Martin Meyerson , president of the State University of New York at Buffalo , demurred publicly after word of negotiations was leaked . Now the Columbia trustees have turned to Alexander Heard , 52 , the able chancellor of Vanderbilt University and one of the small number of their preferred choices . At week 's end Columbia had reason to be encouraged . Heard had not accepted the job , but he flew to New York and was put up at the president 's residence , where he held a series of meetings with Columbia trustees and faculty and student groups . <P> Heard , born in Savannah , received his doctorate in political science from Columbia ( 1951 ) and learned administration as dean of the graduate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move on taking over as chancellor of Vanderbilt in 1963 was to call in student leaders to discuss campus affairs , a move that got him off to a good start with the student body . He then requested a written self-appraisal from each department , getting response from 285 faculty and staff members . This netted him a 4,400-page report 16.3 inches high , all of which he read and used to good effect . <P> During his six years at Vanderbilt , Heard has sought greater student and faculty involvement in governing the university , and this year added recent graduates to the board of trustees . He has strengthened the teaching of sciences and created the rank of " distinguished professor , " a device that allows the university to exceed authorized salaries to attract better teachers . Taking a strong stand against segregation , he has worked to increase black enrollment ( 103 out of 6,000 ) . He shows a thoughtful understanding of student dissent and told a group of Memphis businessmen this year that sending in police is bad because it drives uncommitted students to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be rectified and that the nation " get on with solving the problems our children are so sensitive to . " <P> At Columbia ( enrollment : 18,000 ) , Heard would find troubles that dwarf any he encountered in Nashville . The university faces the possibility of more disruptions by radical students this fall . Its newly established student-faculty governing committee , set up to make the university administration more democratic , is still untested . Several of the professional schools have encroached upon the power of the presidency , and the university expects a crushing $11 million budget deficit next year . <P> Thus many of the tactics Heard has used at Vanderbilt could be applied to Columbia with good effect . There is one exception : if the 7,062-man Columbia faculty and staff were to produce written job appraisals as detailed as those submitted to him at Vanderbilt , the assembled report might well be 109,027 pages long and 33 feet high .
