They called him " Tawl Tawm . " His flamboyant Senate oratory could drown an opponent in sweet molasses or hog-tie him in barbed wire . He smoked ten 15 cigars every day and wore his white hair so long that it crested in curls at the nape of his neck . He dressed in modified swallowtail suits-a dignified black from October to May , a delicate grey from May to September . He was Texas ' longtime Senator Tom Connally . He died last week in Washington at 86 , and , recollecting his career , many a Washingtonian shed a tear for what he thought was a more pungent era . <P> " It Is Murder . " Raised on an east-central Texas cotton farm , Connally went off to college in 1891 , heard a speech by the Democratic idol of the day , William Jennings Bryan , and was so smitten that he copied the great man 's bow-tie-and-frock-coat dress , his stentorian manner of speech and his shaggy haircut . Connally got his law degree at the University of Texas , practiced in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state legislature . In 1916 he won the congressional seat from Texas ' 11th district . <P> His first vote in Congress was in favor of the U.S. declaration of war against Germany , and even though he was then 41 , Connally figured he could not just sit by and send other men to war . He vacated his congressional seat , joined the Army as a captain , sat out the war in the U.S. , and went back to the House after the Armistice . <P> Connally was regularly re-elected to the House until 1928 , when he decided to try for the Senate . He mounted a campaign that put him foursquare against the Ku Klux Klan and in favor of Al Smith for President . Neither position was popular in Texas , but he won anyway . In the Senate , Connally backed most of Franklin Roosevelt 's New Deal legislation , but he refused to vote for the National Industrial Recovery Act , battled fiercely against FDR 's 1937 effort to pack the Supreme Court . In 1938 Connally led a filibuster to defeat an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I am against the lynching of any man , " he said . " It is murder . But I am also against lynching the Constitution of the United States . " <P> Blood on the Wall . Much of Connally 's bluster was for show , and rarely was he deeply , genuinely angry . One such occasion was on Pearl Harbor day . Riding home from a White House meeting on the night of Dec. 7 , he was in tears of rage as he told a newsman : " That goddamned Frank Knox , that idiot , that fool . He told us only a week ago that the Navy was ready for anything . Now it 's lying at the bottom of Pearl Harbor . " As chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , and as an admirer of Woodrow Wilson and the League of Nations concept , Connally began working with Michigan 's Republican Senator Arthur Vandenberg to line up Senate support for the United Nations . He helped draw up the U.N . Charter in San Francisco in 1945 , made speech after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> At one point he arose to speak against Senators who proposed changes in the Charter . Cried he : " They know that the League of Nations was slaughtered in this chamber . " Then he turned , pointed his glasses to the rear of the Senate and roared , " Ca n't you see the blood ? There it is on the wall . "
