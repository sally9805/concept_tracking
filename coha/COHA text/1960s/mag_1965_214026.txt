In his effort to promote negotiations over Viet Nam , U.N . Secretary-General U Thant last week pointed with pride to his native Burma . His homeland , he told newsmen , had been faced with Communist insurrection after independence in 1948 , but by themselves , the Burmese contained the Reds . <P> U Thant added that Burma has a 1,000-mile border with Red China , " but let me tell you , there has not been a single instance of outside help to the Communists inside Burma in the last 17 years . " Had Burma accepted outside aid against the Reds , one of two things would have happened : " Either the country would be divided into two parts , or the whole country would have become Communist long ago . " Finally , U Thant contended that Burma had held off Communism without the loss " of one American life " or the " expenditure of one American dollar in military assistance . " <P> Americans , said U Thant redundantly , should know the true facts about Southeast Asia-but which facts are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is difficult to tell is that Burma 's dictator , General Ne Win , is allergic to visitors ; all transit visas are limited to 24 hours . Burma is indubitably a sovereign state , has outlawed the Communist movement , and has signed a border agreement with Peking . Its high-stepping military , duly cheered each year on Armed Forces Day , is relatively stable and competent . With some success Burma has managed to steer a perilous neutral course between the West and China , having been helped greatly by the fact that the British withdrew in relatively good order rather than at the end of a disastrous war as the French did in Indo-China . <P> But Burma 's countryside has been racked by 17 years of warfare anyway . Besides the Communists , the Burmese army is battling such dissident tribal groups as the predominantly Protestant Karens and the hill-dwelling , opium-smoking Shans . While the fighting has nowhere come close to the proportions of the Vietnamese war , any week 's reading of Burmese newspapers makes the land seem less than idyllic . Recent examples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Lashio . Five armed rebels " who seemed to be Communists " carried off a village chief and shot him . A band of police escorting seven provision-laden elephants was ambushed only seventy miles from Rangoon . <P> About 1,300 political prisoners ( including former Premier U Nu ) are held in jail or under house arrest . <P> Unholy Mess . Happily for Burma , its Communists spend as much time fighting against one another as against the army . The insurgent White Flag Communists , after some inner dissension , came out for Peking , while the above-ground United Workers ' Party backed Moscow . The Red Flag Communists are a Trotskyite rebel group that seem moribund . Peking may not supply arms to the White Flag Communists , but it gives asylum to their leaders . When General Ne Win held 1963 peace talks with the rebel Reds , several of their chiefs arrived in Rangoon via a Red Chinese plane from Peking .
