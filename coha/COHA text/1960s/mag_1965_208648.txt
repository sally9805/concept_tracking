Among the dozen men who serve as Special Assistants to the President , none rates higher in loyalty and devotion than ex-Houston Advertising Man Jack Valenti . If there was ever any doubt about that , Valenti surely dispelled it last week in an extraordinary 3,000-word speech on " The President and the Presidency " before the Advertising Federation of America in Boston . Excerpts : <P> <P> In the shock and disbelief of what is still an incredulous minute in American history , he became President . I shall never forget that day . He sat in the cabin of Air Force One , a scant few minutes after the assassination , solemn , grim , his face an unyielding mask . All around him everyone was in various states of shock , nearing collapse . But the new President sat there , like a large grey stone mountain , untouched by fear or frenzy , from whom everyone began to draw strength . And suddenly , as though the darkness of the cave confided its fears to the trail of light growing larger as it banished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its breast , began to ease , and across the land the people began to move again . <P> The President , thank the good Lord , has extra glands , I am persuaded , that give him energy that ordinary men simply do n't have . He goes to bed late and rises early , and the words I have never heard him say are " I 'm tired . " <P> In his mind is an alarm clock that silently nudges him about 4 in the morning whenever there is air action in Viet Nam . In the darkness , he turns and lifts the phone to call the Situation Room deep in the basement of the White House and then , hopefully , goes back to sleep . Once an admirer wrote a passage about the great lady of Greek letters Edith Hamilton , and it applies so accurately to Lyndon Johnson it is worth repeating now : " She feels like a personal experience the giant agony of the world ; there are not many in this aristocracy of humanity . " <P> Contrary to popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continually say yes to him . He thrives on new ideas , new initiatives , innovations , fresh thinking . If a man consistently agrees and offers no new counter arguments , that man is soon not asked for advice . <P> Like Antaeus , whose mother was Earth , each President goes back to the land and the people for his strength and the renewal of his spirit . President Johnson , like every President before him , sought this renewal and found it during the 1964 campaign in the outpouring of love and affection , in the outstretched arms of mothers holding up their babies to see the President , in the tears and the laughter of the people . <P> I sleep each night a little better , a little more confidently because Lyndon Johnson is my President . For I know he lives and thinks and works to make sure that for all America , and indeed the growing body of the free world , the morning shall always come. * <P> <P> *A concluding comment that inspired this headline in the Washington Daily News : <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DARE TO DISOBEY
