txt Gen. Ne Win Burma 's chief of state leads a hermit land of socialism that seems to wear blinders to keep it from looking East or West . Burmans shy away from world Rangoon , Burma The road to Mandalay may be romantic but few foreigners get the chance to see it these days . In the past several years Burma has become one of the most withdrawn and isolated countries in Asia . The town of Mandalay , along with the rest of the country , is inaccessible to outsiders . Burma 's military regime apparently has decided to shut the world out while the country works away at its internal problems . Thus , foreign investment is unwanted and foreign businessmen nonexistent . Foreign embassies are limited in size . Communications with them are kept to the correct mini . mum . Burma 's channel to the outside world lies through the United Nations whose Sec. retary-General , U Thant , is a national of Burma . Burmans restricted No resident foreign correspondents are allowed and visiting correspondents ? who are rare  --  say visas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than Rangoon . Travel abroad by Burmans is limited . Foreign visitors to Burma are discouraged . The strict earlier rules permitting travelers stopovers of up to 72 hours have been abolished . Now a transit visa for only 24 hours is the most a visitor can obtain and this is hedged with conditions . In this short time a visitor can catch no more than a glimpse of this land of 24 million people . But it is long enough to confirm that Burma is confronted by a string of unenviable probilems . The major one is the state of the economy . Under General Ne Win , chairman of the ruling Revolutionary Council , Burma is pursuing a drastic experiment in socialization . Socialism had long been promised in Burma . But when the general seized power in 1962 the council sent the country hurtling at breath-taking pace down the " Burmese way to socialism " as the official policy is called . System breaks down The country was swept by a high-speed nationalization campaign . The government took over trade , commerce , and industry . Foreigners went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Chinese traders were frozen out , many of them forced to depart the country , leaving their assets behind . Even small shopkeepers were absorbed by the " Peoples Stores Corporation . " The result seems to have been disastrous . The distribution system has broken down . There are shortages . There is austerity . The expanding machinery of government seems enmeshed in monumental bureaucracy . Whether this is because the socialism prescribed is too extreme and too swift , or whether it is because the military simply do not have the expertise and skilled personnel to administer the program , nobody seems sure . All this is being done under the aegis of the " Burma Socialist . Program Party " founded by General Ne Win . It claims to be the " party of the working people . " But the // * Burma bars world to work out woes // people have little alternative choice for politicali opposition has virtually been ground out of existence . Political detainees are believed to number around 5,000 . The government controls the press and other communications media . Trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military dictatorship has silenced orthodox political opposition , a major problem still lingers in the threat from Communist underground guerrillas and dissident ethnic groups in the minority border states which help make up the Union of Burma . Fatalities in this running war total around 50 a month  --  an indication that clashes are fairly frequent and extensive . Regime challenged The Rangoon regime is challenged bty two Communist groupings . There are the Red Flag Communists , generally labeled Trotskyites , and the White Flag Radical Communists , whose allegiance seems to be to Peking . In addition there are the rebel Kachins , Karens , and Shans seeking autonomy from Rangoon . Their interests sometimes coincide with and sometimes diverge from the Communist groups . But General Ne Win 's problems are not confined to an economy in trouble and rebellion in the minority states . Ever looming In the north is the presence of Communist China . Burma 's relations with Peking are correct . But many observers say that beneath this fagade there is a mixture of fear and resentment toward China . - The Burmans are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Communists . Last year Peking broadcast over its radio and published in its newspapers a long White Flag anniversary tirade branding the Rangoon government " imperialist " and " revisionist . " Defense design Some observers who watch the Burma scene from afar are convinced that Burma 's isolation policy is designed partly in defense against this powerful Communist neighbor to the north . They point out that in eliminating foreign influence , the Burmans have moved against Communists and the West alike . The plan seems to be that no foreigners of any kind shall be given the chance to work from within against the present regime . The other reason for Burma 's withdrawal is that the country 's leadership does not want visitors to see the country while it is in its present sad state . Says a Burman diplomat outside his country : " We are in the midst of a great experiment . We want to get it finished before we open the country to visitors . " Meanwhile , some observers point out that although Burma has closed itself to visitors , it has supported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's attacks upon the United Nations and to Indonesia 's departure from it . Burma signed the nuclear-test-ban treaty against Peking 's persuasiveness and , according to observers , has chalked up a ? constructive record on the disarmament question .
