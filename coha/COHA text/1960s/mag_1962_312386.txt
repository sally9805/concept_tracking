PIGEON FEATHERS AND OTHER STORIES ( 278 pp. ) - John Updike-Knopf ( $4 ) . <P> John Updike is a brilliant writer who has so far failed to write a brilliant book . Admiring readers who have watched him warm up for the last several years , exhibiting his perfect half volleys and cableknit sweater , soon may begin to wonder when he is going to get on with the match . The warmup continues in the present collection , as the author jogs his beautifully developed style through a not very demanding series of mood studies , stories and sketches . <P> All of the glittering words are on view ; on page after page the reader 's eye is caught by a lambent phrase that subtly calibrates a mood , or a rasping epithet that tears through surface felicity at exactly the point where the author wants granite to show . But before long , although Updike 's gifts of language have no trace of falsity , the repeated realization of cleverness begins to be annoying . Unwillingly the reader commences to play put-and-take , acknowledging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , taking a point away when a mannerism becomes obvious or the author 's pride of word shows through . <P> Plastic Twin . Updike is a delver into himself , much in the manner of Proust . Most of his protagonists in this collection are really the same thin , brooding young man . although they are given different names . Clearly they are different ages of a fabricated Updike , the kind of plastic twin brother that Proustians invent when they want to probe their own insides without disturbing the machinery . The trouble is that Author Updike does not really seem interested in exploring time and soul , but merely in finding some minimal core to be crusted with his magnificent words . This dedicated 29-year-old man of letters says very little , and says it very well . <P> An instance is a brief story called The Crow in the Woods . In lacelike prose , with just enough homely obtrusions to prevent his art from seeming precious , Updike tells of a young man 's epiphany . The hero wakes up on a winter morning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in awe at trees transformed by snow . He rises , fondly changes his baby daughter 's diaper , and carries her downstairs , warmly conscious of the absent-minded pat of her hands on his neck . His wife bustles down and prepares breakfast . While he is eating it , he sees , through a window , a great crow settle on a snowy branch . It seems to him the most wonderful thing he has ever seen , and he calls his wife excitedly . " The woman 's pragmatic blue eyes flicked from his face to the window where she saw only snow and rested on the forgotten food steaming between his hands . Her lips moved : ' Eat your egg . ' " <P> Words Fondly Tasted . It is beautifully said . But what it says is just not enough . <P> So it goes throughout the collection . Even the book 's best story-a young A. &; P. food checker watches three girls in bathing suits pad through the store , and quits his job impulsively when his boss reproaches them for their immodesty-is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
