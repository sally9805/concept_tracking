U.S. golf fans may never even have heard of him-but that 's fine as far as Peter Thomson is concerned . A stocky ( 5 ft. 9 in. , 170 lb. ) , stolid Aussie who 16 years ago gave up a promising career as a chemist to play pro golf , Thomson is frankly anti-American . " I 've always been one to keep the Yanks at their distance , " he says , and he diligently keeps his own-by refusing to compete on the big-money U.S. tour . But by one standard , at least , Thomson at 35 ranks as one of the game 's top stars : he has probably won more national championships than any other golfer in the world . Last week , to a collection that already includes seven New Zealand Opens , two Hong Kong Opens , the Philippines Open , the Australian Open and the Spanish Open , he added the British Open-for the fifth time . <P> Thomson did it on familiar ground : England 's Royal Birkdale golf course , 7,037 yds. of sand , gorse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bleak coast of Liverpool Bay . It was at Royal Birkdale that Thomson won his first British Open in 1954-when Arnold Palmer was still an amateur and Jack Nicklaus was in junior high school . Palmer was there last week , gunning for his third British Open with a brand-new putter and the happy air of a man who has given up trying to give up smoking . So was Nicklaus , grimly " desperate " he said , to win the only one of pro golf 's four top titles ( others : the U.S. Open , the Masters , the P.G.A. ) that had eluded him so far . Also on hand was Gary Player , who completed a sweep of his own by winning last month 's U.S. Open . In practice , Nicklaus shot a 65 , wowed spectators by reaching Royal Birkdale 's par-five , 510-yd. 17th hole with a drive and a sand wedge . Tony Lema , the 1964 winner , went Nicklaus one better ; he turned his silver trophy over to officials and said cockily : " Put this in safekeeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't kidding . As the match got under way , he shot a first-round 68 , **26;15092;TOOLONG seven greens , coolly curling in twisting putts of 20 ft. and 30 ft. for birdies . But by the end of the second day , the field was still so tightly bunched that only six strokes separated the top 22 golfers . <P> Slip in the Tub . Nerves began to show . Lema moaned about his driving ( " I know where to hit the ball , but I ca n't hit it there " ) and Nicklaus griped about the greens : " Bumpy , too slow , the worst I 've ever seen for a British Open . " Player 's complaint was a stiff neck , the consequence of trying to do calisthenics in his bathtub . " I can only manage half a backswing , " he groaned . Peter Thomson kept quiet-mostly because he had never felt better in his life . For four years , he had been plagued by chronic hay fever , but Royal Birkdale 's sea breeze was just the thing for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
