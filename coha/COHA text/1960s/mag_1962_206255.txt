' Young , Virulent &; Alive ' <P> Sir : <P> I attended the Young Americans for Freedom rally at Madison Square Garden March 16 and was duly impressed with the rousing example of patriotism . I was a Republican , but am now a confirmed conservative . Perhaps a new political party is what this country needs . <P> WILLIAM H. WISDOM Cherry Hill , N.J. <P> Sir : <P> In your report on Senator Goldwater 's speech at the rally , you did not mention his description of conservatism as " young , virulent and alive . " Yes , virulent . Perhaps this should be accepted as the definitive characterization . <P> LOUIS BALDWIN Albuquerque <P> Sir : <P> Why it should surprise anyone that the bulk of ultraconservatives are under 30 puzzles me . Why not ? They missed the Depression , so ca n't understand the desperation that led to social-welfare bills . Never having been hungry and without work , they ca n't understand why they should have to pay to help those who are . They missed World War II and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grand chess game . <P> They 've lived so long in the soothing syrup of security of job and home that they ca n't tolerate the insecurity of the cold war . I 'd rather be dead than Red , too , but first I 'd like a chance to fight the battle without bombs . <P> ( MRS . ) SHIRLEY PUDAS Charlotte , N.C. <P> Sir : <P> Your March 16 issue stated that I did not take part in the Madison Square Garden Young Americans for Freedom rally because General Walker 's invitation was withdrawn . This is the complete reverse of the actual situation . <P> In a public statement dated Feb. 14 , I stated that I would not participate in the affair because it had developed into an essentially partisan Republican rally , which included a well-known political extremist . I urged that the program be broadened to include anti-Communists who were liberals and Democrats , for the anti-Communist cause can succeed only as a broadly based bipartisan movement . <P> THOMAS J. DODD U.S. Senate Washington , D.C. <P> Ex-First Lady <P> Sir : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State 's ex-first lady March 16 could fail to be touched deeply by her poignant statement to newsmen inquiring about her : " Just tell them I 'm a homely old lady . " <P> To those of us who know her only through the news columns , she is a lovely lady who played her role as wife of the Governor with great dignity and graciousness . <P> A devoted mother of five children whose youngest was lost off New Guinea at the same time that her 31-year marriage was going down the drain , Mary Rockefeller has borne her tremendous personal tragedies with heroic silence and fortitude . She is a towering figure of strength and stability beside whom the Governor is a pygmy . <P> VIRGINIA TAYLOR KLOSE Red Hook , N.Y . <P> Sir : <P> Get with it . Your story says Mrs. Rockefeller is a " fantastic horseback rider despite her English saddle . " Yet in the accompanying photo , Mrs. Rockefeller is shown riding the West 's favorite horse , the Appaloosa , with Western gear . <P> MRS . ROBERT M.
