All week long Havana rang with feverish alarms against " U.S. aggression " and " invasion . " Not a day passed without stories that an anti-Castro invasion fleet had sailed from Guatemala , that D-day was coming , that advance forces had already landed in Oriente province . <P> As newspapers , radio and TV commentators beat the drums , the country went on a virtual war footing . The government recalled troops to barracks , ordered militiamen to assembly points , and deployed thousands of men along the fortified beaches on the south coast between the provinces of Pinar del Rio and Camagey . Using the " threat to Cuba " as a whiplash to complete the country 's Communization , Castro 's government warned workers to get into the militia or be classified as " traitors or cowards . " <P> Pennies , Not Pesos . The effect was somewhat different from what Castro in tended . Instead of rallying . Cubans jittered . Coins virtually disappeared from circulation , as citizens put their reliance on metal money rather than on National Bank Chief " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sell 3 cups of coffee until customers produced exact change , and bus conductors had trouble providing change for riders . As many as 2,000 people waited outside the U.S. embassy all night to line up for visas in the morning ; appointments were scheduled ahead to February 1962 . <P> At night , Cubans listened to the anti-Castro broadcasts from U.S.-operated Radio Swan in the Caribbean and whispered among themselves that Castro militiamen had been found hanging from trees in the suburbs of Havana and Santi ago . Grocery stores reported a run on vinegar , as word spread that breathing through a vinegar-soaked cloth would counteract the effects of tear gas and other gases expected to be used when invasion starts . <P> Incident at Guantanamo ? The most interesting word in the Castro vocabulary last week was " auto-provocation . " To the U.S .. it sounded as if he might be getting ready to stage an incident , possibly at the U.S. Navy base at Guantanamo . Time and again he has raged against the base , said he would not attack it , then added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planning an auto-provocation ? " <P> The U.S. State Department does not expect a serious attack on Guantanamo . But last week it called in reporters to make it clear all around that if Castro strikes , the U.S. will repulse him . Though Guantnamo itself is no longer vital to defense , its possession is important to U.S. treaty rights around the world . The Navy has plans to deal with every contingency , from an assault in force to sniping from the hills . If there is a march on the gates by women and children , the Navy will disperse them without guns ; if Castro cuts off the water supply , the Navy has water tankers available .
