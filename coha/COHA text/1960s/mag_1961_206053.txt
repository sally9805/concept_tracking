- With Chrysler Corp . ' s share of the U.S. auto market once again declining ( to 10% in early November ) , Detroiters were unsurprised when Chief Chrysler Stylist Virgil ( Forward Look ) Exner , 52 , resigned to make room for Elwood Paul Engel , 44 , who was netted in a raid on Ford 's styling staff . A disciple of flamboyant ex-Ford Stylist George Walker ( TIME cover , Nov. 4 , 1957 ) , New Jersey-born Designer Engel was largely responsible for the clean , squared-off 1961 Lincoln . Chrysler President Lynn Townsend , who desperately wants the same golden touch for his cars , has ordered Engel to report directly to him to make sure that no corporate roadblocks are thrown up against the new stylist . <P> - After ruling Minneapolis-Honeywell Regulator Co. for 34 years and transforming it from a one-horse manufacturer of furnace damper controls into a $426 million producer of computers and automatic controls for everything from ice cream plants to missiles , Harold W.

Six years ago , invoking a state law that bars a life company from selling casualty insurance , New York State officials blocked Wilde 's efforts to broaden Conn Gen 's business still more by buying a casualty company . Defiantly , Wilde hired Attorney Thomas E. Dewey , and in a five-year legal battle won the right to control a casualty company if it is operated separately . Last week , victory in hand , Wilde submitted to New York officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Co. , a fire and casualty company unrelated to the big Aetna Life insurance complex . j
