To the Finish Line <P> Sir : This election is merely a choice between moral decay and radioactive decay . <P> JAMES POLLOCK Calumet , Mich . <P> Sir : There is an old saying among lawyers that if the facts favor your client , stress the facts in your argument ; if the law favors your client , stress the law in your argument ; if neither fact nor law supports your client 's position , attack opposing counsel or even the judge himself . It is clear that Senator Goldwater 's entourage has been unable to develop rational arguments to support his positions , and this accounts for his constant personal attacks on the President . <P> ARNOLD SCHLOSSBERG Roanoke , Va . <P> Sir : The Soviet launching of a three-person spaceship emphasizes our need to re-elect Johnson , who has already worked long and hard for a better U.S. space program as a Senator and later as Vice President and President . Senator Goldwater is a man who wants to enter the space age wearing a railroad man 's hat . <P> KARL W. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : It seems to me that instead of the continual stress on whether the American people want a " trigger-happy " President , it is high time that people start asking themselves whether they want a " wheeler-dealer " President , who wants to get his way by any nefarious or unscrupulous means and build up his personal fortune into the bargain . Other countries of the world would have far more respect for a President of high moral principles , firmness and unquestionable character . <P> D. WEST Alexandria , Va . <P> Sir : You stated that Johnson wants to feel himself beloved by everybody . I have written letters to his office twice and his staff did not even bother to answer . Apparently he does not care whether I love him or not . <P> JAMES GABBARD Round Hill , Ky . <P> Sir : Protestants , Jews , Catholics , rich , poor , old , young , businessmen , laborers . Northerners , Westerners , Southerners , Negroes , whites , Democrats , Republicans , minority groups and majority groups , allies , neutralists , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against Senator Barry Goldwater . If for nothing else , Senator Goldwater should be commended for his ability to firmly bring the world to an agreement on something . <P> BETTY HENDERSON Pittsburgh <P> The Jenkins Scandal <P> Sir : If , as Mr. Johnson says , he knew nothing of the activities of Bobby Baker . Billie Sol Estes or Mr. Jenkins , he must be extremely naive . If people whom he has known well over many years can hoodwink him this easily , think how our enemies may deceive him . If , on the other hand , he was aware of these things but did nothing about them , it can only be concluded that he condoned the actions of these men . <P> F. L. GOUDY Cleveland <P> Sir : If Dean Burch really had the interest of the country at heart , he could have informed the proper authorities to " phase out " Jenkins without publicity . By making it known , he has not only destroyed a life , but he has made Jenkins the possible prey of any plot to extort information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To use the Jenkins story as Dean Burch does is just a poor sample of charity and intelligence . Let us have peace on earth by wishing a happy Christmas to Mr. Goldwater in Arizona instead of in the White House . <P> N. J. A. SMITH San Rafael , Calif.
