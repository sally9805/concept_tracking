While the world was wondering whether the U.S. or Russia could blast a man into space with rockets and bring him back alive , a California test pilot proved last week that the mundane manned airplane is still a fairly handy get-up-and-go device . Above the shimmering mirages of California 's Mojave Desert , Veteran Test Pilot Joseph Albert Walker rode the nation 's most advanced research craft-the North American X-15-to a height of 169,600 ft. ( 32.12 miles ) . Walker 's flight lifted him farther from earth than man has gone before and provided a strong hint that the winged aircraft may provide a very feasible way of getting to the top edges of the atmosphere . <P> The black , 50-ft. long , stub-winged plane left Edwards Air Force Base tucked under the right wing of a B-52 . Somewhere over the just-awakening revelry of Las Vegas , at 45,000 ft. , Walker and - 55 Pilot Fitzhugh Fulton began their countdown prior to dropping the X-15 for its flight . Midway in the countdown , Walker interrupted by radio : " We 've lost our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cooler both his special flight suit and his cockpit would turn into bake ovens in the searing , supersonic flight to come . As the mother plane circled slowly , Walker jiggled the mixer handle . " I 've worn out my fingers , " he complained . Then : " That was touch and go . I 've got it on again . " <P> Major Fulton finally pulled a pin to release the X-15 . Walker hit the throttle . The rocket engine fired briefly , then died . " I do n't have a start , " he radioed . He tried again . Fourteen seconds passed ( " It felt like five hours " ) . Then , thankfully , the 57,000-lb. thrust engine reignited with a roar . <P> The X-15 shot upward at 35 degrees , its throttle only open to 75% of full power . Walker cut the engine after 93 sec. , but already he was above 100,000 ft. and going 2,756 miles an hour . Coasting higher , he tested eight small rockets in the nose and two in each wing-a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system that will be vital at higher altitudes , where conventional controls turn mushy in the thin atmosphere . They worked fine . Descending , he looked out of his tiny window at most of California , part of Oregon and Baja California in Mexico , noting that the horizon wore a white halo and the sky was " a nice , dark blue . " <P> At 80,000 ft . Walker 's voice came calmly , almost in a bemused tone , over the radio : " Good heavens , we 're shaking to pieces here . " The plane was racked by vibrations , the most violent he had ever felt . " I and the airplane window were going in opposite directions . " Then , as mysteriously as they had started , the vibrations stopped , and Joe Walker headed down to a 180-knot landing in the tan clay of Rogers Dry Lake . Came a voice over the radio : " Wonderful show , Joe . " And another : " Whoopee ! " Said Walker , as he climbed out the cockpit : " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someday you 'll see both sides of this old ball . "
