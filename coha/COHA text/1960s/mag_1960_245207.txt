Amid the pop of champagne corks and the hiss of sulfurous fire , the world 's most highly automated aluminum plant was officially opened last week near Lacq in southwestern France . Nestled at the foot of the Pyrenees on once-sleepy pasture land , the $40 million plant is the showpiece of one of France 's most aggressive and fastest-growing companies : the aluminum and chemical firm of Pechiney , Europe 's biggest aluminum producer . While the plant increases France 's aluminum capacity by one-third , it can be run by only 350 employees . <P> Pechiney moved in among the cows and centuries-old stone farmhouses of Lacq to take advantage of a huge natural-gas deposit which has attracted a whole complex of industry since it was discovered eight years ago . The company has grown so fast since the war that the amount of hydroelectric power available in Metropolitan France , of which it uses 6% , is no longer enough . Its search for additional sources of cheap power ( and cheap raw materials ) has also led it to Africa , where it joined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aluminum plant in Cameroon , helped build an ore-processing plant in Guinea ( with a housing development and community swimming pool ) , is planning still other plants in Guinea and the Republic of the Congo . Its Lacq plant will raise the company 's aluminum capacity to 200,000 tons , about four times its 1949 capacity , but only half the company 's 1965 goal . <P> <P> Only Two Words . Pechiney was founded as a small chemical firm in 1855 , named after an early director , A. R. Pechiney . Later it switched from chemicals , became one of the first manufacturers of aluminum , rapidly expanded . It was hard hit during World War II ; its technology fell behind U.S. companies , and retreating German soldiers sabotaged its factories . But Pechiney poured all its money and effort into rebuilding , expansion , modernization , last year did $300 million worth of business through its French complex and 50 affiliates and subsidiaries around the world . <P> The corporate pieces are skillfully manipulated by an expert chess player named Count Raoul Joseph-Marie de Vitry d'Avaucourt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World War II and the antithesis of the tradition-bound European businessman . De Vitry ( he does not use his title ) began at the bottom at Pechiney , was decorated for fighting in the Resistance during the war , has made Pechiney 's headquarters at 23 Rue Balzac in Paris as modern as his views about industry . " My motto , " he says , " consists of two words : audacity and measure . " <P> Out with Tradition . De Vitry has been audacious in research , now spends more than 5% of Pechiney 's gross on research , higher than other European companies . The company has done so well that it sells many of its processes abroad to Alcoa and other U.S. firms , has sent engineers to five continents to help construct aluminum and chemical plants . Raoul de Vitry has led Pechiney back into chemicals in force ; the firm has built up a whole new range of products-plastics , fertilizers , petrochemicals , synthetic fibers . Last year it raised its exports 50% , to 33% of total sales .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
