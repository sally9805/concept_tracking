txt Raw weather signals are flying for the New England economy . They do n't necessarily indicate economic storms because of possible defense cutbacks , or even bad weather . But ... If nothing is clone about learning where the northeast 's economy really stands in relation to defense and consumer production : It wise planning is not engaged in now for the 60 's and 70 's by business , and by state , and federal governments : If there is nut a harmonious coordination of regional : impact : Defense Ciabacks- in New Englcmd private initiatives with the general United States economy ; Then ... There could be regional economic squalls that in turn could degenerate into the specter of unemployment and some industrial stagnation . It is agreed that an area that has undergone the tragic gyrations that accompanied the decline and fall of the New England textile industry certainly would not want to face that again in the 60 's and 70 's . This is the somber sense and thrust of a study made by a team of reporters of The Christian Science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , weapons conversions , or disarmament might possibly have on the New England economy . Here and there , economic weather flags waft limply and flicker , indicating some of the problems : ? The fact that New England as a region is characterized by persistent unemployment pockets , at a rate of 7.1 percent , considerably higher than the national average of 5.7 percent . ? Pentagon conve , : sions to more complicated weaponry which , generally , should benefit New England 's sophisticated electronics industry . But the unemployment gaps that appear between , or in the process of , conversions do often hurt , in the form of plant layoffs . ? The fact that in fiscal 1963. while California obtained some 50 percent of defense research contracts , Massachusetts received on the order of 5.5 percent of these research and development projects . Tips of Worsening ; Weather ? The fact that in fiscal 1963 , New England obtained some $2.276,000.000. or 9.1 percent of all prime contracts let out by the Department of Defense , a hefty bite , to be sure ; but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for California . or $2.5 billion , or 9.9 precent of the national total for New York state . There are other human indications of why the area needs to take stock of itself . Here are some of the telling hints . tips . indic:Aors , of possibly brewing raw weather : ? The laying off of about 100 workers at the Burlington , Vt. , General Electric Company plant because of an Army contract cancellation . The plant manager denies the company will close down , but employment , which stood at 2.500 two years ago , is expected to reach a mid-year low of 900 . ? The scheduled closing down of a Bomarc missile site at Bangor , Maine . and the entrance onto the scene of men from the Pentagon 's Office of Economic Readjustment to help local municipvl authorities and businesses to case the local economic strains that may result from such a move . // Hawk Missile Nose Cones Travel Down Assembly Line at a Raytheon Plant Although most New England defense production plants are currently booming , economists are calling for a huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of weapons conversions , defense cutbacks , an international climate of gradual peace and possible disarmament , automation , retraining , and regional unemployment patterns . New England Area Runs Up // ? The threatened closing down of the Boston Navy Yard which some economic observers , looking at the question objectively and without any regional " nationalisms " involved , believe will either have to adapt to overall military strategy needs or eventually close . Polaris Contract Incidentally , the entrance of General Dynamics Company on to the shipbuilding scene at Quincy , Mass. , at Bethlehem 's Fore River Shipyards , to work , at least partly , on Polaris submarines , is an indication of the private enterprise trend of keeping up with , or ahead , of Pentagon requirements ? first , by intensive research and secondly , by moving into the Quincy area to make use of the shipbuilding skills already there . ? And , the cutback March 4 , at the Springfield . Mass. , Armory of 500 production employees ordered by the Defense Department . Another 300 employees were lowered in grade , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the cuts , which will decrease the armory 's S25 million annual payroll by . S3 million , were the result of government policy that private firms should be given contracts for production of weapons developed at facilities such as the armory . Solutions Sought Where do sane of the solutions lie ? Most business thinkers and economists say it is in the planning area , that is. in adding some wise regional forethought to business acumen . A sample survey by the Monitor team of reporters shows that though many business firms have planning and research divisions , they are not necessarily making maximum use of them , in looking ahead , say , to converting research applied to military products into peacetime consumer usages . Economist Rudolph W. Hardy of the New England Council says that until recent years there were few defense industries or communities that paid much attention to ' disarmament or arms control problems . " Now . " says Mr. Hardy , " with disarmament even a remote possibility , lack of preparation becomes a luxury we can not afford . " Dr , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harvard University , opined at a recent New England Council meeting that : " Defense cutbacks can be of great and serious importance to a region : if New England does let things go their course in the future . things could be very different . . Completion Phase Professor Smithies notes that " major strategic weapons are reaching their completion phase . Minuteman missiles come off the assembly lines about one a day . and Polaris submarines out of the yards at about one a month . " These major weapon systems arc likely to reach completion in the next two years unless there are great changes in the goals set by the Department of Defense . " There are no successors to these weapons in sight . . . nothing on the drawing hoards , so far as we clearly know , to succeed these two weapons , " he says , that would make much for an increase in defense manufactures . " Furthermore , " the Harvard political economist says , " missiles and submarines do not need the constant repairs that manned bombers do , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Thus , there seem to be indications of a falling procurement level on the New England horizon , from a defense point of view . " Another View Then , again , there is the view that some economists and military strategists hold , that should disarmament , or even gradual peace , come about , the costs of maintaining worldwide surveillance and inspection of weapons systems might even be more expensive than that of simply maintaining sufficient but expensive military strength . ? But the costs and total economics of this view have not yet been fully measured , nor what effect it might have , say , on how the electronics industry would be affected in New England or elsewhere . Presumably , surveillance that makes greater use of spacecraft or detection devices should benefit the sophisticated elements of the electronics industries . Dr. Smithies says that in both relative and real terms there have been few universal or recent consumer breakthroughs from technological research . Though some manufacturers may differ , in degree , with Professor Smithies , he says : " We are using roughly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telephones , and household appliances . Television has been the only big consumer breakthrough on the horizon . E1101 ? 1/10l1A Potential - This suggests there may be enormous potential for development in this field .. .. And a highly diversified outer space program might be almost limitless , but much would depend on the extent and nature of such a program in the next few years . " Reinforcement for a full-scale economic survey of New England , for both short-range defense procurement questions and long-range industry projections , comes from Wassily NV . Leontief , Henry Lee professor of economics at Harvard . Professor Leontief strongly recommends that New England engage immediately in a huge economic survey costing $1 million or even $2 million , the costs to be borne by New England business , the state and federal governments , in order that the area should know clearly where it stands , and in what direction it should project itself . " Research of this kind is , like any good research , expensive , " he says . " But I might mention that if a corporation located @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its products , some food product , let us say frozen fish , or possibly writing paper , it may easily spend one , two , or three hundred thousand dollars on such a survey . Situation Complicated " Now , considering the magnitude of the problem which New England is facing in the case of military expenditures possibly being reduced , and the amount of markets it has to survey , it certainly is many times larger than my- corporation example . The total New England situation is far more complicated . " Which means it would be fully justified in spending correspondingly larger amounts of resources to analyze the problems . " We in New England need to plan , " says Professor Leontief . " Planning may be a dirty word in some circles . " the Harvard economist admits . " but planning is essentially a realistic anticipation of future opportunities , which excludes Spanish castles , and does not miss sonic opportunity which one can not see with the naked eye , but which one discovers if one uses . . . I do n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uses a guide , such as one can obtain from research , and , then , planning . . . . Recommendations Made " As I have said , every corporation , practically every self-respecting corporation today has a planning department , " says Dr. Leontief , implying " why does n't New England itself ? " As for the scope and nature of the survey , Dr. Leontief recommends : ? That it should be a joint affair , in which business , labor , educational institutions , state and federal governments should participate , both as to costs and supplying personnel and information . ? That it should be recognized that disarmament , or gradual peace , is only one of the many factors that will affect the future of New England . One study in the disarmament area is that issued by the Ford Foundation titled " Research in Arms Control and Disarmament . 1960-1063 , " by Eric Stevenson and John Teeple . ? That other factors to be examined carefully are the effects of : Automation ? recognizing that automated machines do not usually affect the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So you must take into account , in studying automation , that New England has a reservoir of high skills .... " 2 . Unemployment ? and factors such as that California can " solve " its labor in-migration problems simply by announcing there are no more jobs , but that in New England the problem is one of workers rooted in the area . 3 . The factors of retraining problems , slowdown in steel , the apparent stabilization and revival of the coal industry . and the relative prosperity of the rest of the country . ? That it is important to look upon New England not as an " isolated regional problem . A huge part of the electronics industry is here , it is true , but the market is not necessarily here . The customers are all over the country .... As a matter of fact , New England is really an exporter to the rest of the nation . " He recommended market studies that would project more than a few years into the future .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
