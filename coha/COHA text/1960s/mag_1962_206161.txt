&gt; For the housewife who feels like the Sorcerer 's Apprentice every time she mops the floor , there is SiphO Products ' Aqua-Vac-an automatic , nonelectric floor washer and dryer . Hook one end of Aqua-Vac 's 20-ft. vinyl tube to a special adapter on the faucet in the kitchen sink , turn on the water , and the cellulose sponge at the business end spreads water over the floor to make a lather with previously sprinkled scouring powder . When the swabbing is done , a twist of the faucet adapter turns Aqua-Vac into a siphon that slurps up the dirty water , empties it in the sink , leaving the floor clean and dry . Says Family Circle Magazine : " The greatest thing since sliced bread . " Price : $14.95 . <P> &gt;For the housebound housewife , trapped in Outer Suburbia without a car and still desperately in need of a bobby pin or a bottle of shampoo , the Shopmobile will soon be rolling to the rescue .
