OCCASIONALLY a book appears that seems to have little or nothing to do with the other literature of its time and place . Such a book is The Leopard by Giuseppe di Lampedusa ( Pantheon , $4.50 ) , a novel about an aristocratic Sicilian family in the nineteenth century . The author , a descendant of the house whose story he tells , had no reputation as a novelist before his death in 1957 , but his posthumously published book has had a great success in Europe and should attract a large audience here . ( It is a selection of the Book-of-the-Month Club . ) Di Lampedusa gives no evidence of having read the modern Italian novelists , or any other modern novelist for that matter . If he brings to mind another writer it is Tolstoy ? not the Tolstoy of vast scenes or all-embracing ideas , but the Tolstoy who excelled in the portrayal of family life in a great household , like the Rostovs in War and Peace . At the same time di Lampedusa has something in his tone that is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that human folly is both more amusing and less reprehensible than Tolstoy could bring himself to see it . The main character in The , Leopard is the Prince of Salina , a great Sicilian aristocrat and landowner , a man of distinguished intellectual gifts ( he has an international reputation as an astronomer ) , but essentially , like the leopard on his coat of arms , a proud and passionate creature . He is a man whose life runs against the grain of his own nature ; he lives in an age of accommodation and knows that for his family to survive he must learn to accommodate himself to new ways , but he hates the necessity of embracing mediocrity . In part the Prince simply faces the need to accommodate himself to the conditions of life , as everyone does : He is no longer young and will soon be older ; his wife is a charming woman but more limited in mind and passion than he might have hoped ; his children are an unremarkable lot with narrow expectations of themselves . But the Prince lives on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role of gracefully acceptingchange that he is powerless to halt . He must walk the tightrope that leads to survival during the period of the unification of Italy ( most of the story takes place in the early 1860s when Garibaldi 's redshirts were uniting Italy under the King of Sardinia ) , although he knows that in a united Italy there will he less and less place for a great feudal lord like himself . In his own household he faces a similar problem . His nephew , Tancredi , a devoted follower of Garibaldi and a special favorite of the old Prince because of his bold , ambitious , and life-loving nature , has been left penniless by a spendthrift father , and in order to make his mark in the world he must marry money . Although the Prince had hoped that his own daughter would be Tancredi 's bride , he recognizes that the lubricious daughter of a newly-rich man of no distinction is a better catch , and tactfully encourages his nephew 's alliance with a family he despises . The main story , the account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two other episodes , the Prince 's death years later and then an incident set in 1910 , when the unmarried daughters of the Prince are in turn grown old . They have become ignorantly pious old women , unaware that the splendor of their noble house is departed , living with distorted memories of the past . The Leopard is a rather wonderful book . It is written with an unblinking eye on the human fact , and yet it has a kind of emotional spaciousness that makes the human fact moving , however shoddy or noble it may be , because its paltriness or farce is seen across the years . The following lines describing Tancredi dancing at a ball with the girl he is to marry make di Larnpedusa 's point of view more obvious than it generally is , but reveal something of his quality as a writer : The black of his tail coat , the pink of her dress , formed a kind of strange jewel . They were the most moving sight there , two young people in love dancing together , blind to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fate , deluding themselves that the whole course of their lives would be as smooth as the ballroom floor , unknowing actors made to play the parts of Juliet and Romeo by a director who had concealed the fact that tomb and poison were already in the script . Neither of them was good . each full of self-interest , swollen with secret aims ; yet there was something sweet and touching about them both : those unlimpid but ingenuous ambitions of theirs were obliterated by the words of jesting tenderness he was murmuring in her ear . by the scent of her hair , by the mutual clasp of those bodies of theirs destined to die . RETURN TO THE . SCENE The Man of Blood by Jose Luis de Vilallonga ( Simon and Schuster , 53 ) and The Disinherited by Michel del Castillo ( Knopf , 53.95 ) are both novels about the Spanish Civil War , and both are by writers of Spanish birth who live in France and write in French . De Vilallonga is old enough to have served in the war ; as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that turned out to be Franco 's , but later he became disillusioned with Franco , wrote a book unfavorable to the regime , and has been sentenced in absentia to long-term imprisonment in Spain . The main character in de Vilallonga 's novel ? the " man of blood " of the title ? is General Pizarro , a peasant boy who because of his great courage and natural military genius rose to command in the Republican armies . After the defeat he fled to Russia , where for a time he studied military science but later was reduced to menial labor . When the novel begins he is returning to Paris on foot after twenty years in Russia . looking for his sister and her husband , who run a Parisian bar that is a meeting place for Spanish exiles . But he finds more in Paris than his sister and her circle of dispirited refugees . He finds the woman , the daughter of the rich landowner on whose estate he had been a peasant as a boy , who had been his wife for a few passionate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he learns enough about her to discover that , in- cad of loving him as he had thought , she had used him to buy her own way to safety , and her power is still sufficient to destroy him . The Man of Blood is tersely written , a little in the manner of Hemingway , and de Vilallonga recreates with brilliant economs both the remembered scenes in Spain and the life of the aging expatriates in Paris . The general plan of the novel is rather diagrammatic , at least if it is read as : 1 political allegory ( and it is not easily read otherwise ) ; the General 's long residence in Russia has completely killed Isis hopes for Communism as a solution to his country 's problems , but the revelation of his wife 's treachery reminds him that the ruling class in Spain has nothing but its own narrow interests at heart . The author 's final judgment of contemporary Spain is probably summarized in the words of the General 's sister : " They 've become small . Bothsides " ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a reminder of the heroic possibilities in the Spanish character . MICHEL DEL CASTILLO is thirteen years younger than de Vilallonga ; as he says in a prefatory note to The Disinherited , his eyes first opened on scenes of blood , and the Spanish Civil War made him homeless . ( The story of his boyhood as an international refugee he has already published in a remarkable book called Child of Our Time . ) But it seems likely that The Disinherited owes less to del Castillo 's actual childhood memories of the war than to his more recent exposure to the debate among French intellectuals on the subject of rebellion and revolution ? significantly . each section of his book hears an epigraph from the work of the late Albert Camus . Each of the main characters represents an attitude toward revolution : Olny , the son of a miserable couple living in a jerrybuilt slum on the edge of Madrid , simply wants a better chance in life , primarily a job , so that he can help his younger brother and marry the girl he loves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is more bitter , class-conscious , and doctrinaire : Santiago de Leyes , for a time Olny 's hero and later his patron , is the scion of a great family and has become a Communist partly out of guilt and loneliness and partly out of desire to reach and serve the people . There is nothing dry or arid about the debate among these men as del Castillo develops it , for it is a debate of actions even more than of words ; by the end of the war all the participants are dead or ruined for their beliefs . Del Castillo 's own sympathies seem to lie closest to those characters who take a religious view of life 's responsibilities ; although in his prefatory note he denies that he has " undergone any spectacular conversion , " the most moving section of his book portrays the last days of an old aristocrat ( Santiago de Leyes ' father ) who has been an unusually good landlord and a just and generous man , but who realizes as death approaches that he has served himself rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite specifically concerned with the problems of Spain , The Disinherited is more generally concerned with the problems of contemporary man as they dramatically emerged a quarter of a century ago in the context of the Spanish Civil AVar . It is not , I think , a great book , but it is intelligent and passionate and continuously absorbing . FROM ENGLAND Eating People Is Wrong ( Knopf , $4 ) , a first novel by a young English writer named Malcolm Bradbury , is an amalgamation of just about everything that is fashionable in intellectual THE NEW BOOKS and literary circles . The main character is a rather ineffectual professor of English in a dreary provincial university , and so the book recalls Lucky Jim , but it also recalls The Groves of Academe , Pictures from an Institution , The Liberal Imagination , the books of various stylish sociologists , the novels of the angry young men , and so much else that a bibliography really should have been provided . In addition to being remarkably well-read , Bradbury is also remarkably witty , so that the surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surface his real concern is with a kind of man who is a little out of place in such a novel . In the first part of the book the professor is put through so many hoops to illustrate the author 's learning or wit that his character has little coherence ; only at the end , when Bradbury writes much more simply and directly and sympathetically , does he emerge as the lonely , suffering figure he is , with no firm affiliations to other people and no passionate commitments to ideas beyond a genuine but not very inspiriting notion that he ought to behave decently . Yet Bradbury is obviously a talented writer , and a good deal of his book is undeniably entertaining . He seems scarcely to have found his own voice in Eating People Is Wrong , but he is certainly an accomplished ventriloquist , and in time he should be an excellent novelist . Evidence of Love ( Atlantic-Little , Brown , $4 ) by Dan Jacobson , the South African writer who now lives and works in England , is an uneven sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective in its conclusion , but it contains some fine scenes and characters , and nothing about the book is trivial or superficial . Kenneth Makcer , the main character , is a " Cape Colored , " light enough to pass as white outside South Africa , and through the intervention of a rich and unconventional old woman in his native town he gets a chance to go to London to study law . There he meets and falls in love with a white girl from the same town , another protegee of his benefactress . He knows who the girl is perfectly well but she does not recog- 97 THE NEW BOOKS nine him ( she had seen him and even spoken to him back in South Africa , but the difference between their social positions there was such that she was hardly aware of his existence ) , and he succeeds in hiding his background from her . When his identity is finally revealed to the girl by another South African the consequences are not pleasant . Jacobson 's characters are all very well drawn ? the rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and partly out of the will to power ; the gentle , idealistic girl and her air-minded , passionate father ; the girl 's London employer , hiding a filthy mind under a censorious manner . But Jacobson is at his best in presenting the " Cape Coloreds " ? Kenneth Makeer and his father and brother , especially Kenneth 's growing awareness that the opportunity to become educated necessarily estranges him from his own family , and that he has personal emotional needs in conflict with his public mission of serving his people . SOME AMERICAN NOVELS THERE are some rather interesting differences between the novels by foreign writers so far discussed and the novels by Americans to he reviewed next . All the imported books deal in some sense with the adjustment between private and public life , between the claims or ideals or repressions of society and the individual 's emotional development . The American novels , on the other hand , are almost entirely concerned with private life . But it would be easy to make too much of this point on the basis of a handful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designated as American arc actually of European bit ( Hans Koningsberger and Ernst Pawel ) , and one of them ( Pawel ) has written a hook that may strike a reader as less American than European in its outlook . An American Romance by Hans Koningsberger ( Simon and Schuster , $3.50 ) is an excellent book within its very limited scope . There are only two characters of any importance , a couple in their twenties : Philip , a rootless young man who has worked in various parts of the country before coming to New York , and Ann , a girl from suburban Boston who has come to New York to work for a philanthropic foundation . They meet at a cocktail party , soon he moves into her apartment , and shortly thereafter they arc married . For a time sexuality holds them together , but differences in their interests , in what they want out of marriage , in their attitudes toward money and the future , increasingly separate them , and by the end of the book Philip has drifted into a casual affair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The book is a little like one of Francoise Sagan 's in its delicate tracing of the arc of passion ; each scene precisely indicates a point on the upward or downward curve of the relationship . The only trouble is that Philip and Ann are a rather dull pair to read about , and it is not easy to attach much importance to what happens to them , especially since , given the kind of people they arc , what happens to them is highly predictable . The Keener Love by Sally Thompson ( McDowell , Obolenskv , $3.95 ) is a story told in reverse . At the beginning of the book a young woman named Sara Wilson returns from New England to the Maryland estate of her mother and stepfather , May and Sam Barnes , with the news that her husband is divorcing her . Then , after a large party , she proceeds to commit suicide in circumstances that make her parents feel guilty for her death . The mother has a breakdown and goes into a sanatorium , but Sam Barnes , who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him as an interloper in the family , attempts to expiate his guilt by undertaking to discover what made Sara 's life such a failure . Sam turns up a good deal of nasty information : Sara had been wildly promiscuous , a heavy drinker , and in other ways no model of rectitude ; and in the course of his investigations Sam begins to drift into much the same pattern of behavior . But by tracing some obscure clues he finally discovers what was really wrong with the girl : her father , his predecessor as May 's husband , never loved her . Consequently Sara went to bed with any man who resembled THE NEW BOOKS her father in an effort to win the love she had not had in childhood , and so ruined her life . Having dislodged this secret , Sam is ready to return home to a recuperating May . Somehow all this does not make a very satisfactory book . The reader feels cheated to have read through a rather elaborate novel simply to find the disassembled pieces of a small and pat case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have been put in a few pages , pages that might have been of more clinical than fictional interest . Yet Miss Thompson reveals considerable native talent as a writer in The Keener Love . In this book she has chosen a rather unrewarding subject , and by telling her story backwards she probably has put it in its most unfavorable tight , but with a better subject presented in a more straightforward way she should produce a novel of real distinction . In the Absence of Magic by Ernst Pawel ( Macmillan , $3.75 ) is another novel concerned with " psychology , " though in a rather more sophisticated way than The Keener Love . Here the main characters are both men , Burt and Peter . Burt is a very successful writer and rich by inheritance ; in his forties he is still youthful in appearance and a great charmer , but he suffers from a crippling neurotic disorder . Peter is a double refugee , first from Europe , where he had a great reputation as a psychiatrist , and second from New York , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him . For some time he has lived on a remote island on the Atlantic coast with two adopted children , a girl of sixteen and a younger boy . The two men have known each other for many years , ever since Burt was a student in Europe in the late ' twenties and a patient of Peter 's . He has betrayed Peter at various times and in various ways , including a seduction of his wife ; but now he finds himself so seriously disturbed that he must have the psychiatric help that only Peter seems to he able to give him . So he seeks Peter out on his remote island , but once in the presence of the man he is driven to re-enact his old competition with him . Since Peter 's wife is dead the competition now centers on the adopted children , especially the girl , whom Burt undertakes to seduce away from her foster father . It is a curious and puzzling story , and I am nut at all sure that I understand what Pawel is trying to do in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good deal more strongly about certain side issues in the book , issues that are only hinted at , than he does about the central events of the story . He speaks with strong conviction , for instance , wherever he refers to the differences between European and American psychiatry , but these differences arc not explored and are of only the most tangential interest in the novel . And the character of Burt is far from clear . Part of this is simply a failure of writing ; Pawel is unable to convey the reality of Burt 's neurotic suffering , and so his motive for going in search of Peter and the consequent events lack power . But once Burt locates Peter he hardly acts like a man desperate for help ; he behaves a good deal more like a man on vacation . At bottom , Pawc 's problem probably lies in the difficulty that the modern novelist faces in trying to reconcile psychiatric and moral interpretations of human behavior . For Miss Thompson , in The Keener Love , this seems not to be a problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too sick to be morally responsible . and it is for this reason that Sara is not a good character to put at the center of a novel . But Pawel obviously sees Burt as morally reprehensible , though It the same time mentally sick , and it is not easy to sec how these two attitudes are reconciled . A Garden of Cucumbers by Poyntz Tyler ( Random House , $3.95 ) is a novel happily without the slightest trace of psychological interest . It is a light-hearted fantasy about a devoted and ingenious butler , Mr. Buckmaster , whose beloved employer , Miss Victoria Woodhull , was left an estate of $243.12 by her father in 1934 instead of the thirty-odd millions she was expected to inherit , and has not yet found out the difference . Miss Woodhull 's merciful ignorance of her true financial state hasbeen maintained these many years only by Mr. Buckmaster 's skillful maneuvering of her elaborate household . He has staffed it with more than twenty servants who are as accomplished and varied a bunch of crooks as ever assembled outside a prison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buckmaster 's foolproof system of shoplifting ; still others work in shipping rooms where they mislabel an occasional valuable package so that it ends up in Mr. Buckmaster 's hands . His brother runs a retail outlet in Philadelphia to get rid of the stolen goods . But these are only the run-of-the-mill of Mr. Buckmaster 's operations , the prose of his elegant criminal imagination . He gets Miss Woodhull to give her house to a foundation dedicated to the comfort of the grieving ? an organization of which he happens to be head ? and thereby makes the house tax-exempt . He is a master forger of letters of recommendations , an impostor who is never caught , a man of most refined manners and most distinguished tastes . Mr. Buckmaster 's greatest scheme is to take the clay 's receipts from Macy 's a few days before Christmas . It would be unfair to reveal the masterly plan he works out for doing the job , or its amazing consequences , but it may be fair to say that disaster is averted from a most unlikely source when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , a dictionary for people who can not spell , has economic value that no one had foreseen . A Garden of Cucumbers is certainly not a story that will please everyone . The joke is very elaborate and wears thin in a few places , but the book has a great deal of wit and style and inventiveness . It is to be hoped that it will not fall into the hands of the criminal classes , because some of the schemes for separating possessions from their lawful possessors look remarkably promising . NON-FICTION The End of Ideology ( Free Press , $7.50 ) , a big fat collection of essays by Daniel Bell , is probably the best collection of sociological essays addressed to the general reader that has appeared since Riesman 's Individualism Reconsidered , and it will almost certainly interest anyone who regards himself as seriously concerned with the present state of American society . The essays deal with a great - ariety of subjects , but almost all of diem attack some received opinion about American society . The source of the received opinions ranges from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in each instance Bell takes the opinion and examines it against the facts . A typical example , and a good place to start for the reader who has no previous acquaintance with Bell 's work , is the essay The Myth of Crime Waves , " in which Bell argues that in recent years there has actually been a decline in crime in this country , contrary to popular opinion . But wherever one turns in the book there is the mark of a vigorous , alert , and well-informed mind at work .
