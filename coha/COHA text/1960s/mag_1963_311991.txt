AT its simplest , the Russian-Chinese quarrel is over what strategy to follow toward the ultimate victory of Communism-and over who shall be in charge of operations . But beneath this there lies a far deeper split : the split between Communist theory and human reality . <P> Ever since Karl Marx predicted that the Revolution would break out in industrially advanced Western Europe , while it actually came in backward , agricultural Russia , such contradictions have haunted Communism . Today , according to Marxist theory , capitalism should be in its death throes , the working class in utter misery , and the former colonial peoples well on the road to Communism . Instead , capitalism is thriving , Western workers are going middleclass , and the ex-colonies tend toward Socialism but hardly toward Communism . Nikita Khrushchev favors changing the theory to fit these facts more closely ; he is , as Peking accurately charges , a revisionist . Mao Tse-tung favors changing the facts to fit the theory ; he is , as Moscow says , a dogmatist . <P> But both are also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and different histories . Khrushchev , the ruler of a nation that has at last begun to gain some material rewards , argues that people are not interested in war or revolution but in peaceful prosperity , and that rocket-rattling will only drive millions away from Communism . Mao , ruler of a country with a lot less to lose , master of a peasantry whose appetites demand a bowl of rice , not a TV set or a car , replies in effect that he is not running a popularity contest with the West . Power can not be won by wooing adherents but by fighting for it-otherwise Communism will atrophy . <P> From the Golden Horde to Yenan <P> Marxism pretends that it raises people above race and nation , but Moscow and Peking are divided by racial hostility and memories of conflict , which would persist even if ideological differences could be ironed out . Russia has never forgotten the Golden Horde of Genghis Khan , which swept west from Mongolia in the 13th century , conscripting Volga boatmen into the Khan 's army and forcing local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mongol Empire collapsed , the newly united Russians lost no time in getting even . <P> " Where is China ? " asked Czar Mikhail Romanov . " Is it rich ? What can we lay claim to ? " Russian claims ( Manchuria , Outer Mongolia , Sinkiang ) caused friction for centuries , down to the present . <P> As late as 1949 , when the Chinese Reds had virtually conquered the mainland . from the Nationalists , Moscow was still dickering for territorial concessions . <P> The Chinese still sneer at the Russians as " Big Noses " and consider them as alien as other Westerners . Moreover , the population pressure along the Sino-Soviet border is a constant menace to Moscow ; by 1980 there will be 1 billion Chinese . When a British visitor suggested to Khrushchev not long ago that the Chinese masses would eventually explode north into Siberia or south to Australia , Nikita replied grimly : " I 'm in favor of Australia .
