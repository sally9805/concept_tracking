" With all the hell I get , " avers Lieut . General Lewis Blaine Hershey , " I have less power than most anybody else . " A lot of draft-age Americans would be happier if that were so . In fact , the crusty Selective Service director in recent weeks has fought the U.S. Justice Department , the White House , and a large segment of Congress , the press , the academic world and the public to a standstill . For a man of 74 who is functionally blind , *Hershey seems as invulnerable as he is intractable . <P> Draconian Draftsmanship . The casus belli was posed by Hershey 's celebrated letter of Oct. 26 , advising the nation 's 4,081 draft boards to induct any draftdeferred protester whose actions were not in the " national interest . " The Justice Department , all too aware in 20th century terms of the legal trouble " delinquents " and their families could make , held that so clearly punitive a process seemed to be indefensible under the First Amendment . Hershey , however , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ totally committed to what used to be called Americanism . <P> After a three-week series of negotiating sessions between Hershey and the Justice Department , mediated by the White House , Hershey agreed to exclude " lawful " protesters from his Draconian draftsmanship . Then , though it had been understood that in the interests of discretion no one would publicly elaborate on the compromise , Hershey told newsmen that he had won the fight . Justice , undone , now feels it must let the courts decide the legality of Hershey 's decision . <P> Members of Congress immediately joined the fray . Seven liberal Senators from both sides of the aisle introduced a bill that would make it illegal to reclassify anyone as " delinquent " unless he destroyed or turned in his draft card , thus removing the threat to mere demonstrators . House members planned similar bills , including one already offered that would bring Selective Service under White House supervision . None of the measures , of course , can be acted upon until 1968 , when the next session of Congress convenes . Eight Representatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be drafted-into retirement . <P> Boon for the Buzzards . That , too , is highly unlikely . After 56 years in the Army and a quarter of a century as head of the draft , Hershey is-like FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover-a Washington monument . <P> <P> One of his most powerful supporters , House Armed Services Committee Chairman L. Mendel Rivers , came out in favor of Hershey 's harshness . " When , " he asked , " did it become a disservice to serve in the armed forces ? <P> It 's the best thing General Hershey could do for these buzzards . " <P>
