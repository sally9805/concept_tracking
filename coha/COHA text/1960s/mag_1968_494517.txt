Successful Failure Walter Benjamin was a literary mind for whom very little in our specifically American culture has prepared us , although there is a good deal in European tradition to account for him . We are not even prepared for his name , more than a generation after his death . Benjamin , to give a swift summary of the essential facts , was a German Jew , born in 1892 , who lived marginally and without basic employment , published several small volumes of essays and reflections , was admired by a few important German writers such as Hugo von Hoffmansthal and Bertolt Brecht ( the latter becoming his close friend ) , never attained any position in German letters during his lifetime , committed suicide when apprehended by the Vichy French while he was attempting to cross into Spain in 194o , was rediscovered ? or seen fully and truly for the first time ? in Germany a decade or so ago . With this book , he makes his first appearance in English . He comes to us accompanied by Hannah Arendt , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long , detailed , useful if somewhat opaque introduction ( which , surprisingly , has appeared as a separate article in the New Yorker ) to Benjamin 's life , work , qualities of mind and special position in the contemporary literary firmament . The position is real and unlikely to be eroded , but it is very difficult to locate and assess . Posthumous fame , Miss Arendt says , is " the lot of the unclassifiable ; " and Benjamin is among the most unclassifiable of writers , a particularly troublesome consciousness to get across to American intellectual ity , with its dogged , helpless need to sort , rate , label and so possess . A literary critic ? Miss Arendt says no , even though Benjamin wrote on literary subjects ? four of the main pieces in this book are on Baudelaire , Proust and Kafka ; another is on the problem of translation , another on the decline of narrative in fiction . A belles-lettrist ? The word speaks of superficiality , the amateur and uninvolved . An essayist ? That tells us nothing . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writers should be thought of as complicated , fascinating situations ) is to regard him as someone who wrote on literature and culture as they would like to be written about if they could choose . He had absolutely no axes to grind , neither policy ( though he was some sort of very original Marxist ) nor social utility nor his own possible fame , and so was free to fashion new thoughts . We 're left with writing that cuts deeply beneath interpretation , exegesis , parallel-hunting , mystery-dispelling and value-mongering : the chief occupations of most of our own writers about literature and culture . As Miss Arendt writes , " what is so hard to understand about Benjamin is that without being a poet he thought poetically . " I do n't believe it possible or desirable to offer in this review any sort of systematic guide to Benjamin 's poetic thought . Illuminations is a book one does n't get on top of , or even know intimately without a good many re-readings . But there are some things to indicate what not to look for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the critic , which is what Benjamin , in despair of any other term , ultimately calls himself , works , he says , like an alchemist ; the commentator , by which he means most critics , like a chemist . The critic therefore studies " the enigma of the flame , of being alive , " studies , ponders , lays himself open to and courts the mystery of the actuality of what exists aesthetically . And that art exists at all is a great mystery , despite what we 've been accustomed to believe : " What seems paradoxical about everything that is justly called beautiful is the fact that it appears . " Benjamin 's whole impulse is toward a primal appreciation of works in themselves . A remark of his that is likely to be most unsettling to our own habit of looking at works for anything they might say outside themselves is this from " The Task of the Translator : " " No poem is intended for the reader , no picture for the beholder , no symphony for the listener . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climax of a paragraph I think essential to getting in the right frame of mind for Benjamin : " In the appreciation of a work of art or an art form , consideration of the receiver never proves fruitful . Not only is any reference to a certain public or its representatives misleading , but even the concept of an ' ideal ' receiver is detrimental in the theoretical consideration of art , since all it posits is the existence and nature of man as such . Art , in the same way , posits man 's physical and spiritual existence , but in none of its works is it concerned with his response . " The essay from which that paragraph is taken is , similarly , crucial to an appreciation of Benjamin 's quests and procedures . In talking about translation more saliently than I have ever seen it done , Benjamin talks also about the nature of language as literature . Translation first comes upon the work of literature when it has begun to live its " afterlife , " so that the " life of the original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowering . " The original can attain this because what is essential in it ? its way of going about language , its " mode of signification " ? is what is passed on in a successful translation ; a bad translation , on the other hand , passes on what is precisely inessential : THE NEW REPUBLIC information of one kind or another , " meaning , " something of use . " It is the task of the translator , " Benjamin writes , " to release in his own language that pure language which is under the spell of another , to liberate the language imprisoned in a work in his re-creation of that work . " What this means for translation as a special literary activity is quite clear : literalness is nothing , fidelity has to be given to the spirit , but not the idea , of a poem or novel . By this standard Robert Lowell 's " Imitations , " so often attacked for being his own new creations , are engaged in the right work . But Benjamin 's thoughts on translation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A translation , " he writes , " instead of resembling the meaning of the original , must lovingly and in detail incorporate the original 's mode of significance , thus making both the original and the translation recognizable as fragments of a greater language . . . " A pure language , a greater language ; by these expressions , which he uses many times , Benjamin indicates his belief in the phenomenon of language itself as primary and as giving rise to its various manifestations , its " fragments " in the literatures of nations . What is most important about literature is not what it says but that it is , that it testifies over and over again to the human capacity for making beauty out of nothing ; and the critic contemplates the enigma of its " being alive , " This central belief that literature communicates its own being means , of course , that Benjamin had no interest in any psychological or sociological or moral approach to written works or , for that matter , any art . It also makes comprehensible his almost obsessive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of formal literary inheritances , and with time , the medium of tradition and also the medium of existence against which art struggles and out of which it plucks its saving increments . He writes of Kafka that " in the stories he left us narrative art regains the significance it had in the mouth of Scheherazade : to postpone the future . " And of reading Proust : " . . . we are guests who enter through a door underneath a suspended sign that sways in the breeze , a door behind which eternity and rapture await us . " Time and tradition . Nothing is more important than that we understand newly and in the teeth of our present destructions of traditions and insouciance toward time as a destroyer , the ways in which literature , far from being the discrete , isolated , independent , freshly sprung series of phenomena we treat is as , is our lifeline to the past . Writers are those who bring the past , with all its losses and depredations as well as its preserved possibilities , into touch with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that runs through , and also against , time in its movement . Everything else in the relations between present and past is history , and art , s , avingly and mysteriously , is what is not history , what is not the mere deadening accumulation of time , against which we rightly rebel . Benjamin 's work is full of quotations from other writers , explicit testimony to his sense of the continuity of all literary and intellectual effort . But it is also his way of breaking up the present , disturbing its settled-upon ideas , making room in it for the past . " Quotations in my works , " he writes , " are like robbers by the roadside who make an armed attack and relieve an idler of his convictions . " Miss Arendt tells us that he had boxes of card-files with quotations gleaned from his wide reading , and that it was one of his crucial possessions . I do n't think I can offer a better sense of how his mind worked and what its results were than by putting down here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Writers are really people who write books not because they are poor , but because they are dissatisfied with the books which they could buy but do not like . " The purpose oi : newspapers is " to isolate what happens from the realm in which it could affect the experience of the reader . " " To perceive the aura of an object we look at means to invest it with the ability to look at us in return . " " The attitude of the snob is nothing but the consistent , organized , steely view of life from the chemically pure standpoint of the consumer . " " Proust 's method is actualization , not reflection . He is filled with the insight that none of us has time to live the true dreams of the life that we are destined for . This is what ages us ? this and nothing else . The wrinkles and creases on our faces are the registration of the great passions , vices , insights that called on us ; but we , the masters , were not home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rage of someone fighting the wind or the rain . This is the nature of something lived through . . . to which Baudelaire has given the weight of an experience . . He indicated the price for which the sensations of the modern age may be had the disintegration of the aura in the experience of shock . He paid dearly for consenting to this disintegration ? but it is the law of his poetry which shines in the sky of the Second Empire as a ' sta r without atmosphere . ' When Benjamin speaks of Baudelaire paying dearly for his poetry , it reflects a theme that runs through all his writing . Baudelaire 's price may have been higher than anyone had yet paid ? he is the beginning of the modern literary era , when writing is fought by society as it had scarcely been before ? but writers , Benjamin believed , are always asked to pay . Writing , he says , does n't come out of an abundance of life but a deprivation ; it is one of the chief ways we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significant that the three writers Benjamin felt the closest affinities with were those ? Baudelaire , Proust , Kafka ? in whom the cost of making up for the world is so clearly to be seen . Art is a recognition of a strange failure in experience , in life itself , a kind of filling in of the crack of original existential sin ; to work at that task is to pay by not being permitted the illusion of solid ground . He speaks of Kafka 's " purity and peculiar beauty " and says that it is the purity and beauty of a " failure . " And then he goes on most beautifully to say : " once he was certain of eventual failure , everything worked out for him en route as in a dream . " Miss Arendt applies the remark to Benjamin himself , when she discusses that life which showed no signs of the accomplishments which lead to eminence and which , even more than that , showed a fatal propensity to do the " useless " and even the fatal thing . Offering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , refusing to diminish what he felt had been entrusted to him by referring it something else , seeing literature as a miracle , this alchemist did his quiet , marvelous , difficult work and left it to the future to determine , as it always does , what " success " is and where it may be found .
