Why do swift and agile fish get caught in slow-moving nets ? They simply get tired . This seaborne secret was documented recently when skindivers of the U.S. Bureau of Commercial Fisheries hung on the mouth of a big submerged trawl and took movies of fish as they were caught . The net moved through the water as slowly as 2 m.p.h. , a pace that most fish can exceed with ease . But the skindivers learned that , fast as fish are , most of them are too lazy to take evasive measures . They swim languidly for a while to keep ahead of the net , but eventually they tire and drift back into its maw . After that , they are stuffed into its trailing " cod end , " from which there is no escape . <P> Encouraged by these observations , the bureau 's Seattle base designed a monster , bag-shaped trawl . The mouth , 117 ft. square , is kept open by floats and kitelike " otter boards " ; it can be submerged at any depth . The great net @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A few fish , including salmon , are smart enough to recognize danger and dart to safety , but most types do not take alarm until too late . <P> Armed with their slow , enormous net , the fisheries men have found an unexploited treasure in the North Pacific . <P> <P> The midwaters between the surface and the bottom , a region usually neglected by commercial fishermen , swarm with great schools of hake . Often the giant net has caught them at the rate of a ton a minute . Pacific hake bring a low price because they are used to make fish meal , but the net has also caught ocean perch and other food fish . The bureau is looking forward to a time when fleets of supernets will comb the neglected mid-waters of the North Pacific , gulping shiploads of fish that are now almost untroubled by fishermen .
