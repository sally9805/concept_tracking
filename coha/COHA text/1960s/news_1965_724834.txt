txt on sports What 's ahead .. . Wimbledon , the most celebrated fortnight in tennis , dawns June 21 . No other single tournament , summer or winter , can begin to match this festive world showpiece . Again this year it would be perilous to pick against the two Australians , Roy Emerson and Margaret Smith , the king and queen of amateur tennis . They rate as favorites , despite Miss Smith 's quirky vulnerability against Brazil 's Maria Bueno . But when the prize is the most cherished in all racketdom , that special drive called desire has a way of fouling the form charts . Dennis Ralston , the ranking No. 1 American amateur , has  --  said he will win Wimbledon this year at all costs . This means he is ready to plow 150 percent of all his energies and concentration into it . Such drive is not unique . It is what Wimbledon is all about . Bellerive Country Club in suburban St. Louis has been stretched to 7,191 yards , the longest in the history of the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starts at Bellerive June 17 . It may sound like a power hitter 's paradise , tailor-made to ? the talents of Jack Nicklaus or Arnold Palmer . But Bellerive is deceptive and devious . It has pinched-in fairways and hair-raising roughs where the grass grows thick and long . Its greens are large , but disaster-laden . Beautiful in name and aspect , Bellerive is a test of golfing severity , perhaps more to the liking of the finesse players of golf ? Julius Boros or Billy Casper or Tony Lema . Jack Nicklaus put it well when he gazed down one of Bellerive 's long , tricky par 5 's and said : " I suspect it 's a question of hitting and praying . " June is the month of sleek , spidery shells and the soft slap of long paddles on pond-like water . It is the time for top-drawer crew racing . The 100th meeting of those ancient rivals , Harvard and Yale , comes June 19 to New London , Conn . Harvard , the current " super-crew " of American racing , is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best collegiate shells in the country will slide across Syracuse 's Lake Onondaga in the 63d intercollegiate rowing regatta . Powerful western invaders from Washington and California will challenge Cornell for top honors . Later in June , England 's celebrated Royal Henley Regatta will embroil the world 's top scullers on the historic Thames . Harvard will be there to test its mettle against strong German and Soviet crews . Trends .. . Englishmen are fast turning their county cricket into something akin to their stately homes  --  a thing outmoded , but worthy of support . They still flock to Test matches that pit England 's best against international touring competition . They still turn out to see vital championship issues or Gillette Cup ( knockout ) matches . But few come anymore to see ordinary county play , that staple sport of English summers for almost a century . Cricket becomes a compulsory subject for conversation now only at Test times . Last year 8.2 million calls flooded UMP ( a cricket phone service called Umpire ) seeking the latest score . But only 1,534,000 turned out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The trend continues this summer . County membership is standing at record highs , but attendance is scraping along at record lows . When Middlesex played a nine  --  day round of matches recently at Lord 's , it drew a sparse crowd averaging only 450 per game . How and why .. . When baseball 's annual all-star game slides into Minnesota this summer  --  on July 13 ? it wo n't be just a question of who plays , but who manages . Who plays is settled by the players . They pick the teams of each league . But the managers  --  that 's another matter . The rule says that he who piloted last year 's pennant winner will manage this year 's all-star team in each league . But wait . Both of last year 's winning managers , Johnny Keane of the Cardinals and Yogi Berra of the Yankees , not only have switched teams . They have switched leagues . Does that mean that Keane , now pilot of the American League Yankees , will manage the National League All-Stars ? And will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a manager anymore  --  lead the American League team ? Who 's on first  --  or is it second ?
