Madame Ngo Dinh Nhu , presently residing in Paris , had been invited to the U.S. to address a " Truth Rally " sponsored by the Conservative Party club of Flushing , N.Y . In due course , she applied for a visa , and last week , in due course , the U.S. State Department turned her down on grounds that her presence would be " prejudicial to the public interest . " <P> The lady was furious , issued broadsides from behind the closed doors of her fashionable Left Bank apartment , fired off letters of protest to President Johnson . But she was not so furious as to lose her head completely . An American correspondent , trying to get Madame Nhu 's firsthand version of the whole affair , knocked on the apartment door , was met by her daughter Le Thuy , and the following conversation took place : Le Thuy : Surely you know that Madame will not see journalists without payment in advance ? Reporter : How much , if we just talk about the visa ? Le Thuy : For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thuy ( after a brief consultation with her mother behind the door ) : Madame will not depart from her fee of $1,000 . There was no interview .
