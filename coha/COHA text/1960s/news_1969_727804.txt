txt " I have a blind faith in del Gaulle , " said Mrs. Blot , " but It do n't know why he had to have a referendum . Politics , I suppose , " If there is such a thing as a. typical Gaullist , it is this wispy widow in black , keeper of a boarding house . Her worry reflects a wide belief that President de Gaulle faces a difficult test tomorrow , even in Gaullist Orleans . A curbstone survey of this prosperous commercial city on the Loire found that the issue on the ballot  --  regional reorganization and Senate reform ? was virtually the least among the preoccupations of voters . For those leaning toward a " no " vote , the overriding concerns were taxes , the cost of living and the survival of small business , On the side of a " yes " vote , stability and the stature of the President  --  who has made the referendum a confidence vote on his continued tenure ? outweighed the possible merits of greater regional autonomy . The poll also found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , except that a general feeling of dissatisfaction cut across all lines . " De Gaulle is right , " said an antiGaullist intellectual , " when he talks about a social malaise . " At the depot , a young railroad worker said : " I 've no con- fidence in anybody . I vote my pocketbook , and it says ' no . ' " , He and his friends , leaning on his sedan during their lunch break , all agreed that the pay raises won in the general strike of last May had been consumed by higher prices and taxes , notably on cars and gasoline . " An unmarried man , " said one youth , " has to work two months a year just to pay his taxes . " " Well , maybe the thing is to get married , " a girl replied with an offhanded smile . At the Camping Bar in suburban St.-Jean de la Ruelle , a stocky , middle-aged worker from the Renault plant handed around Communist leaflets calling for a " no " vote , then joined several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how much wages had gone up since last May , but all were sure that prices had risen more . Deficit Spending Cited One said with a smile : " We always pull the devil by the tail "  --  a Gallicism for deficit spending . More grimly , an auto worker growled : " De Gaulle is always in the arms of the Pope . How can you be farther to the right than that ? After all , he 's an aristocrat ? ' de ' Gaulle . How can he represent the Republic ? " The leaflet distributor acknowledged that if the regime was turned out , the next one might not be any better . " Not now , " he said , " but in the future , perhaps yes . " Down the bar , a worker from another plant winked and said , " Just because we vote ' no ' does n't mean he 'll leave . " This man offered one of the few direct comments on the referendum issue . " Me , I 'm against the region , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and there 'll be a superprefect who 'll command . " A foreman agreed . " Why should people 60 miles away decide whether we build a swimming pool here ? " he demanded . He confided that he had voted for the Gaullists last June , but would not tomorrow , because of taxes and prices . ' The Taxes on His Car " We did n't strike , " he said . " Why should we pay the taxes ? Let those who broke the windows pay for them . " Warming up , the foreman demanded to know why he had to pay taxes on his car while his company maintained four cars as " business " vehicles , for the owners , who thus avoided paying the taxes themselves . Ironically , however , few factory owners are known as stanch Gaullists . In the Rue Ste.-Catherine in old Orldans , a young couple talked in tones of despair as they tended a little open-front butcher shop . " Whatever the Government ' is , " the woman said , " we 're just the odd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said her husband , tying a roast " I 'm 28 , " he said , " and I 've got to pay $350 a year for my retirement tax . " " We break our necks for a customer , " his wife said . " And suddenly we do n't see him any more . " She nodded toward the big new supermarket-department store on the corner . " They 're exempt from five years of taxes , " she went on . " It 's the cars , too . People spend all their money on cars , and the food business suffers . They tell us things will be better in 10 years , but in 10 years we 'll have spent the best years of our life . " The random survey suggested that blue-collar workers and intellectuals would tend as usual to vote against General de Gaulle , merchants would be divided with a strong antiGaullist shift , and young whitecollar employes , technicians and women would tend to vote " yes . " Boarder Changes Stand The three young boarders who remained over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clerk , a surveyor and a real estate salesman ? all had voted Gaullist in the past . This time , however , the salesman , Patrice Mutelle , 24 , was defecting . In the television room last night , all listened silently as the President made his final appeal . On the closing words ? " Vive la France ! " ? Mrs. Blot exclaimed : " He 's sincere when he says that ! " Marc Laize , the surveyor , agreed : " He 's a Frenchman . Of all politicians , he 's the straightest . " " Well , " retorted Mr. Mutelle , " he said ' Algerie frangaise : " " My son was in the army in Algeria , " Mrs. Blot said . " What else could de Gaulle do ? " " Oh , he gained votes all right , " Mr. Mutelle acknowledged . " But not mine . I 'm for the regional reform , but not for changing the Senate .
