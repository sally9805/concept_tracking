The lawyers who will be defending him and the military judge who will preside at his court-martial seem to agree on one vital issue : Army Lieut . William Galley Jr. , who is charged with the murder of 109 Vietnamese civilians , may be unable to get a fair trial . According to the judge , Lieut . Colonel Reid Kennedy , potential witnesses have been violating his orders against talking to the press . Powerless to enforce the ban , Kennedy called on the Attorney General of the U.S. last week to look into ways of prosecuting five news organizations* and certain individuals-though just what the charges might be was unclear . <P> The defense joined in protesting the news reports , but it also offered another argument . By holding Calley in the military beyond his discharge date , said his lawyers , the Army is keeping him in " involuntary servitude . " Arguing that a court-martial does not adequately protect a defendant 's rights , they made a motion to dismiss the charges . Even Calley 's career-Army lawyer , Major Kenneth Raby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criticizes military trials as " marked by the age-old manifest destiny of retributive justice . " <P> Minimum Constraints . Many observers go even further . They question whether Calley can get a fair trial in any court of law-military or civilian . Where , they ask , is the potential juror who has not heard or read some account of events in My Lai on March 16 , 1968 , that would affect his verdict ? President Nixon himself may have influenced the trial when he asserted at his press conference this month that civilians were killed in the village . " There is not anybody in this country , " insists Calley 's civilian attorney , George Latimer , " who does not think that the My Lai incident is abhorrent , because the President said it was . " <P> Others raise doubts whether the autocratic military structure can ever permit a fair trial for Calley or anyone else who may be charged in the case . They suspect that the Army may well try to blame low-echelon officers in order to absolve the top brass-and to avoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Conversely , a number of lawyers contend that a military court may be biased in favor of Calley . The ten members of the court-martial , five or more of whom will ultimately decide Calley 's fate , have already been chosen by Major General Orwin C. Talbott , commanding general at Fort Benning , Ga . All career officers at Fort Benning , they range in rank from captain to lieutenant colonel ; five are in the infantry , two in the Signal Corps and three in other branches of the Army . <P> A career officer who has seen combat is in fact much more likely than a civilian juror to understand the strain on the G.I.s at My Lai . Professor Paul Liacos of Boston University Law School believes that Galley 's fellow officers may well resist pressures from above to make him a scapegoat . Moreover , says Lia-cos , such men are " usually sophisticated compared with most juries , and it is harder to sway them by emotionalism. "               @ @ @ @ @ @
