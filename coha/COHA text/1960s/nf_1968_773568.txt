txt wherever two workers are together. * In a word , the Party is the very movement which unites the workers by carrying them along towards the taking of power . How then can you expect the working class to repudiate the C.P. ? It is true that the C.P. is nothing outside of the class ; but let it disappear and the working class falls back into dust particles . Is it to be understood that the worker is passive ? Quite the contrary . He transforms himself into action when he enters the class , and can assert his freedom only in action . But this freedom is a concrete and positive power : the power to invent , to go further , to take the initiative , to propose solutions . It is only by outrunning the situation and catching up with the movement that this freedom can enrich him . Freedom of criticism , on the other hand , makes not only the cell leader or the union representative frown : everyone is afraid of it in others ; it recalls the earlier isolation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case , that criticisms , even if they were tolerated , could not emanate from any spontaneity or from some revolutionary " instinct " : the worker , transformed by the organization into a moving force , finds his practical reality beginning with his metamorphosis ; whatever he thinks or does , it begins with his transformation ; and the latter , in its turn , takes place in the actual framework of the Party 's policy . His freedom , which is simply his power to transcend the given situation ? in short , to act ? manifests itself then within this given reality which is the organization ; he forms his opinions on the problems which the Party submits to him and does so within the context of the principles which the Party gives to him . In short , he does n't judge the Party in the name of a policy whose principles are engraved in his unconscious , produced by his spontaneous reaction or by the contradiction of bourgeois society .

In a word , the Party is his freedom . Today , a worker in France can express and fulfill himself only in a class action directed by the C.P. ; he is molded by the arguments of the C.P. , by its ideology and its principles ; if he tried to turn them against the Communist policy , they would of themselves proceed to justify it . If a serious error is committed or a defeat sustained , he does not have the tools by which to understand the meaning , nor the presentiment to guess at it ; he simply lets go , his effort is broken , he falls back into the field of bourgeois attraction ; the class goes to pieces . But when he has fallen back , it is to rediscover , under the agency of hostile forces , his despair , his ignorance and his feeling of powerlessness . The Party has regrouped far away from him . It is inaccessible , like an imperative which one does not judge , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that one could say that Kant 's ethic is inhuman . Which amounts to declaring that all class action has become impossible . " In sum , " says the anti-communist , " we said that the working class repudiated the Party ; you say that it has reduced the workers to despair . We do n't feel like pursuing these idle discussions any further and we say you are granting us all we asked . " I grant nothing . I note , like everybody else , the discouragement of the masses ; but I still do not know whether the policy of the C.P. bears the responsibility for it . And then , between our two interpretations , I see a chasm ; if you have found only a verbal difference , it is because you do n't give a damn about the working class . Imagine a proletariat , clear-eyed , completely fresh , which would repudiate the C.P. and immediately form a new party ( you know , that famous very French Communist Party which would distinguish itself from the French Communist Party by its independence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internationalism . ) If such a proletariat existed , one would have to deal with its wishes : who else could decide ? If the proletariat returned to the natural stage of atomism , but were still seething and always ready to regroup , to take up the struggle again , you could , in a pinch , hope to palm off your trash on it , and even offer it a substitute Party . But you know very well that 131 the working class is collapsing , that it is taking the measure ' of its powerlessness , and that it risks turning its millions of defenseless men over to the steam hammers of the bourgeoisie ; you know that in the coming months everything will conspire to increase the isolation and the resignation , the distances between men , to make the proletariat an archipelago . When the workers have touched the bottom of bitterness and disgust , do you really believe that you will be able to sell them your clap-trap ? I have already told you : if they lose confidence in the C.P. , they will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the universe will be bourgeois . And if you hope that they will climb up the slope again , you must know that only the C.P. can help them do so ; if they rediscover their unity , it will be in order to gather around the C.P. ; if they realize their combativeness , it will be in order to obey Party orders . Already people are whispering : " You 're crazy ! To desire an independent Left and in league with the Party ! Do you want it to regain its influence on the masses ? Keep discreetly out of it ; let the disintegration go on ; one day the Party will blow up . " Things are n't at that point , fortunately : but even if they were at the worst possible point and you were the irreconcilable adversary of the Party , I can not help considering contemptible those who are awaiting Communist discomfiture from the worker 's despair . I am told that the worker will pull himself together , that I fail to recognize the intestinal fortitude of the French proletariat ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a psychological profile , to be known for its hibernations followed by sudden awakenings . Just look at 1848 , 1870 , 1936 , 1948 . I am looking : but rather than violent acts of an explosive temperament , I discover in these battles the action of precise factors ; and in the " sleep " which followed , I see the effect of defeat and Terror ; the workers ' strength was annihilated each time and it took long years for it to reconstitute itself . If we believed you , there would be little need to worry . In twenty years , in fifty years , we would see a fine , brand-new proletariat reappear . In short , one would cultivate patience : after all , life is not so bad and anticommunism pays off . 132 Good . We will wait . Twenty years , if necessary . Unless in six months the Third World War breaks out . In which case we run the risk that there will be no one at the rendezvous : not you , nor I , nor the liberated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have shown that the discouragement of the workers could not be considered even implicitly as a condemnation of Communist policy . The reason for it , then , remains to be found . That is the goal I assign to myself today. * One can duck the question in two ways , both of which proceed from the same sophism . The anti-communist " of the Left " will not even hear mention of the workers ' lassitude : he shows us a proletariat of steel plunged to the hilt in the decaying bourgeois carcass . The anti-communist " of the Right " shows us the bourgeoisie in the guise of a young giant who is carrying a dying proletariat in his arms . In both cases , it is a matter of quietly ignoring everything that might resemble a reciprocal conditioning ; in short , of denying the class struggle . The anti-communist " of the Left " knows the French bourgeois from close up ; he willingly admits that their national characteristics have been produced by circumstances . On the other hand , he simply denies the existence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself simultaneously within all capitalist nations . How could this proletariat be tired out ? And what relationship ought this hypothetical product of capitalismin-itself to have with our so regrettably empirical bourgeoisie ? The latter was formed little by little through the agency of accidental ( hence negligible ) factors . ( Let us cite , for example , the Revolution of 1789 . ) Determined exclusively by the contradictions of capitalism , the history of the former is limited to reflecting the successive transformations of large-scale industry . Our bourgeoisie becomes frightened and plucks up its courage , makes mistakes and repairs its errors , directs its affairs poorly or well ; the proletariat never loses a battle nor wins one , never makes errors and never discloses any particular truth . Irresistible , incompressible , everlasting , it matures . Relentlessly . It is the most terrible enemy of capitalism-in-itself . One does n't see what harm it could do to the French bourgeoisie : this proletariat will never encounter it . This conception would relieve one of making a historical explanation ? and perhaps any explanation ? if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to denounce the crimes of the C.P. Without the C.P. , the French proletariat would not have an empirical history : the Party lodged itself in the working class like a grain of sand in Cromwell 's bladder . What is it then ? A disease of the proletariat-in-itself ? You will be informed that the proletariat-in-itself does n't have a disease : it can neither slow down nor accelerate the movement-in-itself which animates it . Its misfortunes come to it from a very historical failing of its leaders . If Stalin 's heart had been tenderer , the face of the world might have been changed . And do not ask how it happens that the empirical militants of the C.P. can throw the wheels of the hypothetical proletariat out of gear : for having begun by eliminating history , the anti-communist is constrained to reintroduce it at the end in its most absurd form , as a series of accidents , in order to account for the distance which separates reality from his calculations . For my part , I maintain that the development of capital , taken in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worker 's movements . But these in-principle considerations will never of themselves explain the particular traits of the class struggle in 134 France or England between two given dates . A concrete fact is the singular expression of universal relations ; but it can be explained in its singularity only by singular reasons : to try to deduce it from an absolute but empty knowledge or from a formal principle of development is a waste of time and trouble . In truth , there are dialectics and they reside in facts ; it is for us to discover them there , not put them there . I have spoken of discouragement : if one wants to prove that I am mistaken , one must establish by evidence that the workers have kept their " combativeness . " And even if one established it , this preserved courage would remain a specific emotion and would call for a specific explanation , just like discouragement . The French proletariat is a historical reality whose singularity was made manifest in recent years by a certain attitude : I do not go looking for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but in the movement of French society ; that is to say , in the history of France . The anti-communists " of the Right " arrive at the same conclusions by the opposite reasoning . To the workers of flesh and blood , they oppose eternal France , you know , a France of splendid upheavals , a France which a providential man always saves at the last moment ; trim , lively , and alert , always busy , always running , this France resembles the Madelon of the song . Knights and captains of industry , merchants , bureaucrats and country folk ? everyone sings , everyone works , everyone participates in the bustle . There is only one dead weight : the proletariat . France looks around , worried : " Who then prevents my workers from following me ? " And whom do you expect it to be if not the Communist Party ? Since it contemplates our destruction , do n't be surprised at the fact that it has undertaken to stupefy the French worker . The latter , of course , is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of his fathers and understands that his interests are one with the employers ' interests : at heart he would ask only to work to take out his fair share of the national income . But the Communists have befuddled him : if they fail to set him against his good masters , they retain enough strength to keep him from joining them . Divided between the distrust that the C.P. inspires in 135 him and that which his boss inspires in him , he freezes in a kind of tetanus . How far would n't we go , to what could n't we aspire , if the filterable virus of Stalinism had not infected our proletariat ! Dear slippery friends , are we to believe France is immortal ? How long do you think you can hide from us the fact that she is dying ? The sickness which paralyzes the proletariat began by hitting the entire society . You who are talking , are you so alive ? Your tail still quivers when you hear the word " communism " but your body is flaccid and limp ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? All the others ? Where are our great hopes , our great ambitions , our great undertakings ? The peasant scratches the soil with his hands , the industrialist wallows , the banks are moulting into savings institutions . We live poorly , very poorly : the salaries of half the population of France do not exceed the subsistence minimum ; the youth suffocate or become expatriates , saying that there is no longer anything to do in France . And the government ? Does it govern ? Maintaining discord by lies , rigging the electoral law , imprisoning opponents , forbidding their sons to enter the best graduate schools , establishing over our divisions the sly and hypocritical dictatorship of weakness , putting off indefinitely the vote on social laws , making promises to the State workers and civil servants and then refusing to keep them , crushing the country under the weight of an absurd tax system ? can all this pass for a domestic policy ? Kidnapping the Madagascan chiefs in planes in order to drop them from the sky onto the roofs of their villages , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tunisians on bottles , firing point blank on the Moroccan workers ? can this pass for a colonial policy ? Sinking billions in a war which is already lost , which we pursue for lack of the courage to end it , and which spreads from one ministry to another like the clap ; horse trading French sovereignty , accepting the domination of the United States over half the world and German hegemony in Europe , can that pass for a foreign policy ? Are they statesmen , these weak-nerved Catholics who faint at the rostrum , roll under banquet tables , and think they are Richelieu because they have blood on their hands ? These socialists who fire on striking miners ? These great patriots who traffic in dollars ? These ignorant and puffed-up 136 lackeys , always ready to lick boots or to show their asses , so long as the price is right ? If they remain in power , it 's because no one in bourgeois France cares about politics any more . Remember , in 1952 , the newspapers were shouting victory because at the elections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apathy when the workers hold aloof from a demonstration : what will you say when the voters hold aloof from the voting booths ? In today 's France , the working class is the only one with a doctrine at its disposal , it is the only one whose " particularism " is in full harmony with the interests of the nation ; a great party represents it and it is the only one whose program includes the safeguarding of democratic institutions , the reestablishment of national sovereignty and the defense of peace ; the only one which preoccupies itself with economic rebirth and the increase of buying power ; the only one that lives , that swarms with life while the others swarm with maggots . And you ask by what miracle the workers follow most of its assignments ? I pose the opposite question , and I ask what prevents them from always following them . There can be no doubt about the answer : if the proletariat gives signs of exhaustion , it is because it is affected by the anemia of the nation . In order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eating away at all of us ? it is not enough to line up alongside the working class : the disease must be known by its causes . Leaving eternal France at grips with the proletariat-in-itself , I am undertaking to explain events rigorously defined in time and space by the peculiar structure of our economy , and the latter in turn by certain events of our local history . We live poorly because we produce too little and at prices too high . You ask who is responsible ? It 's the German who declared two ruinous wars on us ; the Russian who , from Moscow , slows down reconstruction ; those who have resigned from the birth rate , who , by refusing to be born , deprive us of future customers ; the backward peasants who wo n't make up their minds to consume ; the subsoil , finally , which betrayed France by giving way under her feet . In short , everyone is guilty except the ruling class . That is just what bothers me : too many traitors . So many 137 causes so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is France dying by chance ? We will come back to the Muscovite and the worker at our leisure . But as for the two World Wars , how can one imagine that they are responsible for our stagnation ? From 1913 to 1929 , in spite of fifty-two months of devastation , French production increased by thirty percent ; after which it has remained stationary until today ; that is to say , for a quarter of a century : in the same period England was increasing its production by half . And then what ? We are told that we have been marking time since 1929 : whatever the ills that overwhelm us , would n't it be absurd to seek the reason for them in a disaster occurring ten years after their first manifestations ? At the origin of so continuous a deterioration , there must be a structural fault , a defect . The subsoil then ? Let 's leave that to the spelunkers and the cavernicoles . Blame the coal , blame the oil , blame the nonferrous metals for hiding abroad like vulgar capital , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under our feet : you will not be any further ahead for it . Has nature betrayed us ? That 's too bad ; only it betrays all of Europe at the same time , and look : equally betrayed , the Belgians , the Swiss , the Scandinavians live better than we . As for the British , at the end of World War I they had a fine occasion to cry " traitor ! " While their backs were turned , their ungrateful clientele left them flat : it bought American coal , Japanese cotton , German steel . If England had had to do then what we are doing today , she would have let herself fall on the dungheap to attend her own ruin , prophesying the while but without lifting a finger to stave it off . England had all the excuses : her glorious old industry seemed the bone structure of the nation ; can one change one 's bones ? England broke them : since the ancient foundations of her industrial preponderance had been undermined , she decided to change in order to remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her production . Within twenty years , she has transformed her anatomy and her physiology , She has reversed her population currents , reclassified and redistributed her manpower , abandoned her mine pits and mining cities , and has oriented herself deliberately towards the manufacture of highly specialized products . Is our problem so different ? For us also , it has been a question of getting around a difficulty which could n't be attacked head on and of intensifying production by a reorganization of our economy . But an inspired propaganda persuades us that our constitution is immutable in order to prevent us from modifying it : France has soft bones , Pott 's disease ; let her stay in bed : at the least effort of the patient , the vertebrae would break . In short , we are supposed to believe that the moon is made of green cheese and mistake Nature for Destiny . Do n't believe any of it : Nature shuffles the cards and deals ; each gets his hand from her , but not directions on how to play the game : Nature asks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she orients the economy without governing it . Better yet : the economy makes Nature quite as much as Nature makes the economy . Industrialization can take many forms and the scarcity of natural resources does not exclude them all a priori : it was known from the beginning that France , unlike Victorian England , could not even attempt to make her entire production dependent on extractive industries : was she forbidden to favor her manufacturing industry ? Could n't she specialize , develop together and one by the other the importation of raw materials and the exportation of finished products ? The problem was declared insoluble very quickly , but what can be known about it since , until recent years , they were careful not to state it ? We can acquit the mineral kingdom : it is men who have made the French economy , who make it each day . Our present decline , just like our former grandeur , is a human adventure , and we are both its victims and its artisans . Suppose the burden of responsibility is put on the back of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep production this side of a certain threshold beyond which the flow of products could no longer be assured . Great idea ! Its principal merit is to bring us back to the human kingdom . And then the peasant consumes little , that 's a fact : at least , in the southern half 139 of the country . Only here 's the problem : short of believing in eternal France and in the unchangeability of the French " character , " I do n't see that one can seriously offer the shrinking of our markets as a primary cause . Are we supposed to be nationally tightfisted ? You 're joking . If the farmers do n't fulfill their " social duty as buyers " is n't it more likely that it 's because they live on the products of their land ? What forces them to do so ? Damn it , the constant diminution of their buying power . Do you want to know where this progressive impoverishment comes from ? From the fact that working the fields no longer pays , quite simply . Thus we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that it is their fault and that they stick stubbornly to their old routines instead of buying tractors ? It 's true . But in societies as in feedback machines , the conditionings are reciprocal . In stagnation of consumption , one must see an effect as much as a cause , or rather a cause which is at the same time the effect of its own effects . Let us reason clockwise : few tractors are bought ; therefore few are produced ; and , since the markets are too small to amortize the expenses of retooling , the agricultural machine factories have no interest in modernizing . Conclusion : tractors are expensive because the peasants hold back from mechanization . The reasoning is precise and , moreover , marvelously suited to encouraging inertia : if you choose the farmer right off as an independent variable , you deprive yourself , by hypothesis , of any means of acting on him . Let us salute in passing this fine example of reactionary pessimism : greed and habit are in the peasant nature ; therefore our economy will not change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the index of industrial prices remains higher than the index of agricultural prices , the small rural farmers will not have the means to modernize their farms ; they hold aloof from mechanization , because mechanization holds off from them , and their habits will not be overcome until machines are put within their reach . This second conclusion , as legitimate as the first , has the additional advantage of being practical : it opens the exit which the other had shut . But is n't the peasant himself bothered by the strangling of the agricultural market ? Yes , of course . But we find again , on this new ground , the same cir-140 cularity of effects and causes . Clockwise : the harvest can not be absorbed ; therefore , France produces too much wheat . Counterclockwise : the French are underfed ; therefore , France does n't produce enough wheat . Since it is necessary to turn , let us turn . But from where do we start ? Is there primacy of supply or primacy of demand ? That depends on what one understands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yesterday 's customer or tomorrow 's ? And who are these irritating buyers who run from their duty : the rich who are stingy or the poor who ca n't pay ? In the last century , the manufacturer boasted of creating needs in order to satisfy them : " In a competitive system , " he said , " production is increased in order to reduce costs . The narrowness of markets is only a temporary accident : a market is either conquered or invented . Since there are forty million Frenchmen , we have forty million customers . True , most of them are consumers unbeknownst to themselves . That need be no obstacle , we 'll discover them as buyers . If necessary , we will seek them out in their homes and no matter how little they can pay , we will ask them still less . " In short , according to the manufacturer , production depended on machinery and conditioned consumption ; demand varied as a function of supply . And it was on the continued enrichment of the nation that capitalism based its sole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries , the movement of the competitive economy was to find its logical outcome in mass production which aims at a mass clientele and for which , in theory , the market is inseparable from the entire nation. * Good . But what are they telling us today ? In the France of 1954 , would demand condition supply ? This was true at the time of the crusades : a stratified society whose economy was dominated by agriculture furnished a fixed and customary clientele to artisans , who worked according to inherited recipes . Do they mean that we have come back to that ? And could it be that our em- 141 ployers no longer believe in progress ? In that case , how do they manage to justify their privileges in their own eyes ? Each year , for the last twenty-five years , they have been deploring the fact that consumption remains stationary . A fine excuse : we live on what there is . Even if we should all die of starvation , how could we eat more , since we are not given more to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave the slums that their fathers lived in . But where would they go , since people refuse to build ? Neither destiny nor human nature is responsible for the constriction of the market ; and production , whatever one says about it , has not ceased to regulate consumption . But here , production , instead of pushing consumption , slows it down . Everyone has heard of those night clubs where champagne costs a fortune because the management seeks to " select its clientele . " France has come to resemble such night clubs . It is the elite who consume , and prices are quite deliberately set to exclude the rabble ; housing is refused to the shelterless , food to the starving , shoes to the barefooted . The time is near when on the windows of bakeries will be posted the notice : " To buy bread , proper dress is required . " That 's what seems clear : even if consumption , half-strangled , turns on production to strangle it in turn , it is production which moved first ; in it resides the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , provided one looks for it where it is : it is called dispersion . In the United States , as early as 1930 , manufacturing plants employing more than 260 wage earners represented four percent of all enterprises and absorbed more than half of the man power . In France , in 1953 , the plants which provide employment to more than 100 wage earners absorb only forty-six percent of the man power and represent only one one-hundredth of French industry . Around a few giants , the micro-organisms multiply rapidly : in Paris , for metalworking alone , 18,000 enterprises have 400,000 workers . In commerce the dispersion is accentuated : the establishments which employ more than 100 wage earners possess twelve percent of the personnel and represent one tenth percent of the total . These facts are known to everyone ; people con-142 elude from them that France is a museum piece contemporary with the Moral Order and gas-lighting : this piece of machinery with innumerable wheels apparently survives through a caprice of history and apparently continues to obey the laws of the last century . Which convinces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and others that God is French . They are all mistaken . Our economy is of its time and the nineteenth century would not have been capable of producing it ; to give it its wrinkles and its little old-fashioned air , nothing less is necessary than the powerful means at our disposal today . Of course , at first glance , the 500,000 odd French enterprises with their eight to ten million wage earners evoke the fine days of liberalism ; but it is only an illusion . Much more than by its dispersion , the liberal economy was defined by the competitive system that leads normally to concentration . In order to preserve the archaic dispersion of our stores and factories , competition had then to be suppressed : minor businesses can exist only if large-scale industry and high commerce refuse to absorb them . In short , the big have agreed to sell as dear as the small . Thereupon , the small are prohibited from being competitive : a truce sine die is imposed on them , and peaceful cohabitation . From Dunkirk to Menton , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gather a multitude of two-bit tradesmen and of shopkeepers around a few large concerns . To drive its tiny rivals to ruin , the big employers would only need to push production a little . They are careful not to do so and , if they agree sometimes to refurbish their equipment , it is not in order to produce more and to sell more cheaply but to increase their profits by reducing costs . But whatever care they take to spare their neighbors , they have done nothing if they do n't effectively protect them against crises : at the least puff they will be blown away . They will feed them a mouthful at a time ? at the consumer 's expense : at Lyon there is no doubt that the Fabrique could noticeably reduce its costs by entrusting the work of weaving and spinning to its own workshops : it prefers to have it done by dispersed enterprises which live on it alone . That is still not enough : the State must participate in 143 this charity , multiply the tax reductions and bonuses , strengthen customs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxpayer and , to get to the point , all of France . The principal function of the tax system is to redistribute revenues : but this redistribution , in France , profits the enterprises which the normal play of competition would have eliminated . The Frenchman pays taxes in order to be able to buy his national products at high prices . As for the money which is left over ? admitting that there is any left after these various deductions ? a special providence keeps watch over it . Like Claudel 's angel who tirelessly turns the young Prouheze away from young Rodrigue in order to put her back in the bed of an old man , the angel of Malthusianism does not tire of deflecting the flow of new investments towards the most decrepit enterprises . Just try to finance a new company in the making : they will make you repent your stubborness : " What are you trying to do ? Cooperate in the development of productive forces ? Who asked you to ? Is production going to be developed at the very moment when large-scale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry ? Fortunately , capital goods are very expensive : this is normal , since they are produced at great cost . It 's better to patch up the old machines : they were around when we were born and can still be of use . " If you insist upon going ahead , the banks will get into the act : take your savings to them and they will give them to the State , which will swallow them up in the Public Debt . In short , people are not content with stealing the money of the poor , they sterilize that of the rich . From there on , everything is in order : outdated equipment , high costs of production ; industrial prices rise rapidly , the agricultural customers desert the market . The farmers , in turn , using decrepit instruments , produce at great expense , and the rise of agricultural prices deprives agriculture of urban customers . Look at this splendid circle and see how the effects reinforce the causes : a branch of industry restricts its productive activity , it deprives certain enterprises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the market ; the affected enterprises will in turn restrict themselves in order to survive , which will cause new pullbacks ; this revolving depression will finally come back to its 144 point of departure , giving rise to new restrictions on the part of the manufacturing concerns which were its origin . Thus consumption adapts to production and production , in return , adjusts to consumption . The motor turns over ; only one problem : it slows down with each turn and will finally stop . When a social system is the object of so many cares and calls for so many sacrifices , can one maintain that it is the product of chance ? The heavy mechanism would have broken down long ago if someone had not kept close watch over it ; the cumbersome multiplicity of its wheels would have been simplified through use without the interference of an invisible hand . In other words , the " directed " dispersion of our enterprises presupposes the unity of an intention and the unity of a policy , hence the secret unification of our economy . In France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the sectors of national life . The difference is that the Americans killed off their little employers , while we keep ours in chains . They live , but just barely , and their docility has been assured by persuading them that they were already dead and that they would crumble to dust if their permits to live were not extended periodically . For this reason our economic regime presents a certain resemblance to feudalism . Against competition , which daily grows more severe , against the ferocity of the barons , an increasingly dense crowd of two-bit tradesmen and shopkeepers sought protection . They finally offered their property to the big employers who gave it back to them immediately in the form of vassal-type fiefdoms and not without having , in passing , stamped them with their seal . At present , they have no more than the usufruct of their stores and factories .

However , these reprieved dead cover up for the great lords of industry : in exchange for a protection which keeps them from sinking into the proletariat , they are obliged to render services of a very particular 145 nature : their function is to save the appearances of competitive capitalism by hiding the monopolies . Is our economy an anachronism ? Say rather that it is aberrant : This system , artificially created and maintained by the efforts of our big capital , aims at the integration of productive forces : but it substitutes for technical concentration the concealed centralization of the directing organs . It is difficult to understand why our great feudal lords are bent on ruining France . Note that they have a ready-made answer : " It is , " they say , " in order to limit the damage .

If , tomorrow , demand increases , the small enterprises will be incapable of satisfying it : and it is to them that big industry has tied its fate . On a steep slope , the prudent automobile driver puts his motor in low gear . Likewise , our sagacious producers , fearing that production will bolt , put brakes on it with its own machines .

We know how Marxism explains overproduction and periodical crises : in a competitive regime , invested profits become increased means of production and the consumption of the wage earners declines . Could our great capitalists have read Das Kapital ? In order to avoid crises , they have strangled competition , organized underproduction and reinvested their profits abroad . 146 Thus they have made us a depressive economy by their terror of depression . The operation owes its success to the cooperation of the small employers . They mask from the consumer the Malthusianisrn of the higher-ups . Forced to pay their wage earners very poorly and to sell their products at high cost , they must either fold or determine prices and wages . If the Government decided to regulate the market , a bureaucrat 's stroke of the pen could condemn 500,000 enterprises . Besides , these two-bit tradesmen have powerful lungs : let a minister dare to tax them , and they scream blue murder ; let their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figures in hand , that they do not have the means to grant it . And that is not entirely untrue , since they are always on the brink of bankruptcy . They alone are seen , they alone are heard ; it would seem that the sole business of the nation is to be concerned about them : these frantic , dying men give us daily proof that nothing can be changed in France without bringing everything down . Meanwhile , sheltered behind them , the big employer proceeds with the scientific organization of his factories : if he wanted to push his machines to full capacity , prices would cave in on the spot : but he finds greater advantage in assuring himself a profit without risks by augmenting to the furthest extreme the gap between his costs and market prices. * Since that necessitates maintaining an important fraction of French industry at its lowest potential , he solemnly recognizes for the small proprietors their nominal ownership of their enterprises , i.e. , he perpetuates their powerlessness and the frittering away of our resources . In return , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce little at great cost : this unjustified surplus profit has the character of an annuity paid to big industry by small industry . Thus our bourgeoisie is becoming bourgeois : it prefers comfort and stability to the indefinite growth of profits ; our great feudal lords are quite simply rentiers . Nevertheless , this conservatism 147 must be explained . Is it possible that our distrust of the future boils down to a fear of future crises ? Naturally , our evolution must be seen within the European framework : the period of expansion has ended . Europe is losing its markets one after the other , everywhere one notes the tendency to exchange profit for dividends . But why has this general retraction been accentuated to such a point in France ? How explain this Malthusian mania that we seem to be dying of ? I think that our history will furnish the answer . History advances in disguise : when it takes off its mask , it marks the actors and the witnesses for all time . We have never recovered from the two " moments of truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our bourgeoisie is playing a losing game today because it saw its own true face in 1848 and in 1871 . Under the July Monarchy , the French population was composed of bourgeois and animals . The king was bourgeois and the bourgeois was king ; the bourgeois was man and man was bourgeois . The animal was an animal ; they harnessed him to machines . Often enough , hunger drove him through the streets : they calmed him down by setting dogs loose on him . And then , one day , everything changed ? that was in June of 1848 . The government had heard rumors and had glued its nose to the windowpane : instead of ordinary livestock , it saw an army ; the proletariat was bursting into official history and waging its first pitched battle . What a shock : these beasts fought like men ; everyone was struck by the obvious logic of their maneuvers . In short , the " haves " discovered man confronting them in a species that was still foreign to them . This was the origin of their great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all Humankind became Other and the Bourgeois recognized himself in the eyes of the Other as other than Man . If the wretches belonged to the human species , the bourgeois was distinguished from them only by the violence he inflicted on them . Suddenly , the bourgeois was defining himself by his refusals : in arrogating the right to prescribe limits to his species , he had set his own limits ; if the excluded were to make themselves the measure of man , the bourgeois would perceive his humanity in others as an 148 enemy force . Rarely has the question been better posed : submen had infiltrated mankind , they had to be dislodged from it . How ? By hanging the ringleaders ? That could not suffice : the bourgeoisie had lost its calm certitudes and would not regain them short of finding itself all alone in the world . And then , if the massacre had begun , it would have been dangerous not to carry it through to the very end : the massacrers would be acquitted only if they had taken care to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the working class had to be exterminated . The affair looked promising : mad with rage and shame , the bourgeoisie , stripped naked , wanted to put out the eyes of all the proletariat ; the National Guard made it a point to shoot the wounded . Unfortunately , the repression was stopped prematurely . The elite was dismayed : ten million dead would have cleared it ; 1,500 shot transformed it into a pack of murderers . When everything was over , the elite so strongly feared to see itself and to be seen that it abandoned its political rights to a mop-up team who in return guaranteed it its ownership rights . Atrocious crimes which clearly showed their bestiality were attributed to the dead ; the survivors were kept in their animal condition . All the " haves " had developed a hatred for Paris : to make it healthier , it was cut into pieces ; the hike in rents finished off the job by forcing the poor back outside the walls . The workers disappeared from official history . Nevertheless , they continued to live , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From time to time their eyes glittered ; then quickly , the heap was fired into . It was not enough to have deprived them of speech : the bourgeoisie tried to take away their memories . In vain ; the workers jealously guarded their memories , preventing the bourgeoisie from freeing itself of its own : it did not for an instant forget its terror , nor the horrible visions it had had , nor the blood with which it had covered itself . This was quite clear at the fall of the Empire , when the representatives of the bourgeoisie , letting their jitters and their resentment burst out , refused to meet in Paris . The insurrection exasperted the bourgeoisie without surprising them ; they were expecting it . One minute wiped out a twenty-year interlude . People returned to the fundamental question : they or we ? In the eyes of their prisoners ? those fixed eyes which 149 pretty Versailles ladies practiced putting out with the tips of their parasols ? the sons discovered the intolerable truth which had enraged the fathers ; they resumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of whom 3,000 died in jail , the French bourgeoisie let the world know that it had improved its techniques of extermination . It had cause to regret it : in spite of its performance , it had started the error of 1848 all over again and , for the second time its arm had stopped too soon . Having failed to annihilate the opponent , it had won only a battle and risked losing the war of attrition . Meanwhile , Europe looked on with amazement : when it came to exploitation , foreign employers could have given us a handicap . Only ? was this cleverness or clemency ? ? they had , in general , spared themselves recourse to weapons . Never would the English capitalists have agreed to kill the worker with their own hands ; they were satisfied with bestializing him and , for the rest , they let natural laws " operate freely ; " they left to God the bother of eliminating surplus workers . The British capitalists did not forgive France for revealing the nature of capitalism and changing the class struggle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt quite alone : it would have boasted willingly of having carried out in twenty-five years the two prettiest massacres in contemporary history , but the German and British puritans treated the French bourgeoisie like a black sheep . When it cried out to them : " Let us make common cause , " they backed away , holding their noses . To top all the misfortune , the French bourgeoisie had to live from day to day cheek by jowl with the victims : and the victims were curiously emancipating themselves thanks to the good offices of the Cavaignacs and the Galliffets . Fifty years earlier , the workers had begged the employer to look down on their misery , certain that it would suffice for him to see their misfortunes to want to cure them ; in 1848 , they still believed Lamartine when he spoke to them of " the tragic misunderstanding which separates the classes . " After 1871 , they understood ; so much the worse for the bourgeois . Elsewhere the masters succeeded in remaining invisible , in effacing themselves before what they call 150 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For this reason , the worker does not really hate them ? can one hate abstractions except with an abstract hatred ? And besides , even if he should hate them , his hatred would carry with it his own transcendence : he knows that they consider him a beast that aspires to humanity and that must be continuously held back , but he considers them men who do n't know themselves or who insist on not knowing themselves . Whatever the violence of the Revolution he hopes for , he has never proposed exterminating his class enemies : the liquidation of the bourgeoisie is to free the bourgeois from his ignorance and from the bourgeois abstraction in order to restore to him his humanity . It is not the man he detests in the bourgeois , it is the idea of suppression , the negation of man : as long as the struggle is carried out on economic terrain , the worker 's hatred stays within the realm of generality . * In 1848 and in 1871 , the French bourgeoisie came out of the clouds ; its arm was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oppression , maintains itself by violence . But it did not require that violence or that ferocity of repression . In 1848 , the insurrection of misery did not really endanger the employers . In 1871 , negotiations had been initiated , a conciliation remained possible : the men of Versailles rejected everything ; they were the first to pass to the attack because they wanted to kill . In a word , they played the zealot . Our bourgeoisie let itself get characterized by the insolence and cruelty of its officers , by the timorous cruelty of its politicians , by the hardness of the owners and manufacturers , by the abject terror which it showed at first , then , after victory , the ignoble jubilation of its respectable press and its respectable women ; its acts have sculptured its face : it incarnates them . The workers ' hatred immediately becomes incarnate in turn : its object is no longer the capitalist abstraction ; the workers detest the man in the French bourgeois , the man of flesh and blood , who was made real by his historical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the bourgeois is the product of capital ; for our workers he is also the son of his works , a killer ? and he will remain so for a long time . The young working-class generation grew up in the stifling silence of the Second Empire , it witnessed , powerless , the slayings of the Commune . When it finished its apprenticeship , the class struggle had been transported onto economic terrain . But these newcomers will never forget what they saw : when they want to anticipate the reactions of their bosses , they will remember Thiers , Galliffet and Schneider and on the basis of ineffaceable memories they will judge the boss capable of anything ; they will expect to see the beginning social conflict degenerate into civil war at any moment , or rather civil war seems to them the truth of the class struggle ; these young men are going to be irreconcilable enemies of the bourgeois : because they have learned , at a price , that each class pursues the death of the other , and above all because wrong was done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; in France alone , it has been bled . The proletarian of 1886 sold his labor power to the men who killed his father or his older brother ; hence his attitude towards them , a very special mixture of twice-fired hatred , of cold hardness , of scorn , of fear and of explosive violence . Everywhere else , the workers ' leaders more or less openly renounce revolutionary action in order to exploit thoroughly the advantages of universal suffrage : the laboring classes will have their representation in parliament . This means choosing integration : one accepts the fact of capitalism and one defends the interests of the national community in order to obtain as counterpart the improvement of social laws . Reassured , the employers develop their enterprises ; people will not worry about the concentration of labor when they have the good fortune to possess an integrated proletariat . Social democracy served as hostage and intermediary ; its very ambiguity* enabled it to assure the permanent linking of Capital and Labor ; by simply existing , it prevented the workers ' secession . When the oppressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order , communication is established , national unity is preserved ; and then , since they use language , language can be used to mystify them . It is when the oppressed are silent that they frighten people . In France they were silent ; the proletariat had seceded . After 1871 , this class that had been decimated and wronged cut itself off from the nation and formed a society within society . What did universal suffrage matter to it ! This class believed it had learned at its own cost that electoral friends are most often class enemies . After all , universal suffrage gave power to the butcherers of the proletariat . The state ? be it democratic or not ? is " the concentration of employers , carried to the highest power . " For this single reason , even if it had a chance to influence the debates , the proletariat could not agree to take part in public affairs . Send representatives to the Chamber of Deputies ? Who could represent the proletariat which despises both the Right and the Left ; in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a bourgeois , whatever his label , can defend the interests of the workers against those of the other bourgeois ? France , at the end of the nineteenth century , was the only country where social democracy was deprived of a working-class base . The worker did vote , it is true , but listlessly , to satisfy his conscience , without making a tie between his functions as a voter and his activity in support of his demands . He fulfilled the former as a non-integrated individual , as an abstract citizen lost in the abstract crowd of other citizens ; he supported the second as an organic member of a closed community . As a result , the working class , walled up in its savage isolation , now relies only on itself : it rejects Millerandism and condemns social laws when the members of parliament take the initiative to get them passed . Its leaders lose no chance to assert the autonomy of the workers ' movement nor to point out the antagonism between the unions and the Party . The S.F.I.O. multiplies its advances in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independence . " In the face of these " powwows " and these " routines , " the proletariat , without any other experience than its own , blazes its own trail ; it keeps the struggle on the only ground it can call its 153 own : that of labor . Revolutionary syndicalism is the proletariat itself , exalted by its isolation and proud of its abandonment : betrayed by the peasants , twice betrayed by the petty bourgeois , it decides to draw everything ? even its ethical values ? from its own resources . The workers are living a very special moment of their history : the moment of separation . In 1871 , the national community threw them out : they accepted their exile and turned the negative into the positive ; what is sometimes called trade union imperialism or working class totalitarianism is only the admirable about-face of a caste of pariahs : they wished only to be something ; they are condemned to be nothing , so they will demand to be everything. * Our bourgeois were dirtying their drawers from terror . Since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a no-man 's land peopled by corpses separated the workers from the employers . The bourgeoisie could no longer even resort to considering this silent crowd a herd of animals : since they had held the regular troops in check , the proletarians were men . Not entirely , however : if the bourgeoisie did not want them to become judges , it was quite necessary that they remain animals . A combination of man and ant , the proletarian appeared at once transparent and opaque : he put intelligence , energy and courage at the service of a mysterious animal nature and of incomprehensible instincts . The employers became fascinated by this obscure mass and discovered in it only the reflection of their own violence . They were not mistaken either : the secret of the working class is that it regards the French bourgeoisie as a gang of criminals . By seeking to challenge their silent judges , our elite confirmed their sentence : 154 these good people , having prolonged the massacres for a long time after the victory , could not invoke self-defense : so they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They went to work on it : the proletarian , they said , is neither man nor beast . If he were a man , we would have respected him ; if he were a beast , we would have caged him up without hurting him . But he is a human beast , that is to say a beast that attacks man with human means ; or , if you prefer , a man whom irresistible forces drag along always towards the worst ; he is sufficiently free for one to have the right to punish him , sufficiently slave by nature for one to be able to despair of his redemption ; in short , you have to keep your eye on him and be ready to slaughter him at a moment 's notice . Thus , in order to cleanse itself of a crime , the bourgeoisie gave itself the right to repeat the crime at will . Perhaps it should have pleaded with some appearance of reason that rage and fear had driven it insane and that it was only guilty on occasion . But no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justifying it , the bourgeoisie changed and became criminal by vocation . As for the young employer who , around 1890 , assured the succession of the generations , it seemed at first that he could be reproached for nothing : he was , doubtless , a murderer 's son , but he was too young to have taken part in the summary executions , and the blood spilled by the parents could not be allowed to fall back on the heads of the children . So he had the choice and could , at will , repudiate his father or become obdurate . He chose , as we know , obduracy . The fact is he was brought up in hatred : he was taught to detest the victim so that he might not judge the executioners . He took everything , credits and debits , the factory and the parental crimes . Then he was forced to go one better : " On entering the factory , " he said , " I found hatred and I had n't done anything to provoke it . What do they reproach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet ; as far as I know , none of the young workers has as yet been killed . " The proof is given : since the young bourgeois has not yet slit the worker 's throat , the worker 's hatred is unjustified , it is an a priori , the fundamental relation between the worker and his boss ; the proletarian is hateful by nature ; 155 the bourgeois is the innocent object of his detestation . The poor bourgeois ! Whatever he does , it will always be the other who began it . I tell you , the workers seek our death ! Today this argument is still the delight of the reactionary columnists : it is more than sixty years old and there 's not a wrinkle in it . From 1890 on , there was n't a small employer who did n't identify with bourgeois society . Why was a raise demanded of him ? Because they wanted to destroy the national community . Why did a trade union congress question capitalism ? Because they wanted to slit his throat and rape his daughters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of the last century , granted itself a supplementary right which could be called the right of perpetual self-defense . This select class uses as a pretext the blood it spilled in order to imagine that it is in a state of siege , beleaguered by the human beast , and that each of its members , from the cradle to the grave , is in permanent danger of death . In a word , the children of Versailles detest the French workers wholeheartedly , just as the German barons , thirty years after the peasants ' war , still hated the sons and grandsons of the serfs whom their fathers had tortured . Killers will kill . A third generation of massacrers enters the race course , finds in it the dust of its elders and the track of their virtues . These younger massacrers do what they can to give the class struggle a slight appearance of vendetta ; they show their hatred so that the workers will make their own apparent . Thus , each enmity is reinforced by the other ; they try to maintain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the least incident can set off riot and bloody repression. * The weapons are polished up and 156 the justifications are right at hand : these fine young people are getting ready for " tomorrows that sing . " One can well wonder what miracle saved the proletariat from a new Saint Bartholomew 's Day . What miracle ? Why quite simply the " second industrial revolution " : it originates in the United States , and arrives in Europe and France . Our great bourgeoisie is on the threshold of twentyfive years of plenty which will double our cast-iron production and triple our steel production . There is good cause for rejoicing , naturally , but not without some reservations : the trouble with capitalism is that it engenders its own gravediggers ; and it just so happened that the gravediggers began to multiply rapidly . Not only does the working class grow continuously from the rural influx but , on top of it , it is the working class ? in the urban centers ? which is having the most children . The statistics of 1906 reveal the frightening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for 100 employers 358 ; for 100 workers 395 . And it must be added that the neo-Malthusian propaganda of the anarcho-syndicalists penetrated the " upper strata " of the proletariat : it is the unskilled workers who are the most prolific . As early as 1869 , LeroyBeaulieu gloomily noted : " The workers on the bottom rungs , those who have the crudest and and most poorly paid jobs , continue to have large families , due to lack of understanding their own interest or because of the impossibility of continence . " The result : the working class represents twenty-eight percent of the population at the beginning of the Second Empire and thirty-five percent at the beginning of the twentieth century . If a name had to be given to the miracle which safeguards the proletariat , I would call it the multiplication of gravediggers . The employers get frightened : the traditional physiognomy of France is changing ; in 1850 , one Frenchman out of seven lived in a city of 5,000 inhabitants or more ; in 1900 , 157 one Frenchman out of seven lived in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " country people " who aided the men of Versailles in 1871 , in their great work of purification ; supported by the countryside , the bourgeoisie was sure of crushing the workingclass minority at the least outburst : after all a soldier is a peasant . But what would happen if the relationship were reversed ? Whose turn would it be to massacre ? Hatred is very contagious . Whether or not they were born in the working class , the new arrivals appropriated its memory and assumed the sufferings of the Federes . During this time , of course , Paris was purified : people lived there in a bourgeois manner , people voted well there , people tolerated only the nicer poor . But when the people of Passy raised their heads , it seemed to these bourgeois that their favorite obsession had materialized : an enormous crowd was massed at the gates of the city and grew larger and larger ; the capital was in a state of siege . Our gentlemen mounted the fortifications : there was the proletariat as far as eye could see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trampling down the harvests . Meanwhile , from the four corners of France , the poor wretches were setting out to join the army of gravediggers . The men of Versailles had assassinated only a handful of persons ; their children suddenly discovered that these dead had innumerable descendants . This must be stopped . How ? People were already talking of integrating the working class : more easily said than done ; integration means paternalism and the 1871 fusillades shattered paternalism . In the North , the Company integrated with all its might : but that was because it was operating in isolation . In these locked and bolted departments which no one entered and no one left , the question of population never arose , everything was under control ; the inhabitants changed trades almost without changing residence ; they left their villages only to settle in the workers ' housing development nearby . There they found cadres and customs , a feudal hierarchy in which their places were already marked out . In a word , the company manufactured proletarians by imposing controlled levies on the native population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? How could capitalism direct the metamorphosis of the peasant into a worker ? Factories 158 rose up ceaselessly from the land and others closed their doors ; ceaselessly , the requirements of the market forced a modification in the techniques of production . These upheavals have been expressed by a permanent instability of jobs ; the workers no longer have any geographical link with their place of work . In LevalloisPerret , in Charenton , the active population explodes and scatters every evening ; another replaces it which returns from all over . Should one run after these semi-nomads ? Where can one look for them ? Competition pits itself against paternalism : the former continuously recasts the physiognomy of the working-class suburbs ; as a result , these heaps of men have been perpetually stirred up by pendular movements which mechanically accomplish the transformation of the rural people into proletarians . Well then ? Decentralize ? Break up this enormous mass in which the least rumor is amplified to the point of becoming thunder ? This dream is not new , and the employers indulged in it well before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peasants outside the walls in order to escape the regulations of the guilds . Deconcentrate , decentralize , decongest : substitute for the great uncontrollable mass " little masses " spread throughout the country and therefore easier to keep well in hand ! Unfortunately , the moment was not propitious ; and to achieve an understanding , a master plan would have been necessary : it was again competition which interfered by sowing discord among the employers . Well ? How could capitalists prevent the terrifying rise of the proletariat ? They can not , after all , fire into the heap . The policy of extermination suits periods of unemployment . In 1848 , it was the obvious thing to do ; they were right to bump off men who were costly without bringing anything in . Anyway , the liberal economy ? that admirable machine ? would have taken on the responsibility of reestablishing equilibrium by itself ; it had only been given a mere push , and no one could find fault with the good faith of those who shoot the workers to prevent them from dying of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forbid fettering the free development of economic forces . Whatever the growth of the working-class population , man power supply remains lower 159 than demand . To fire on a man when he is worth so much is wasteful . From time to time , government can take the liberty , as it did at Fourmies , of a local rectification of the working-class forces . But even then it must act with prudence : if the working class should get angry , millions would be lost . Taine and Renan advise having recourse to the gentle forces of social Malthusianism , its effects being sufficiently slow to pass by unnoticed at first . Since ? as Leroy-Beaulieu showed ? the unskilled worker does n't know his true interests ( which evidently demand that he die as soon as possible and without descendants ) , one could try to open his eyes for him . Our Government should assign itself two tasks : to root the peasant to the soil and to facilitate the continence of the poor . A campaign of speeches is undertaken ; in the Chamber of Deputies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Academy , there is only one cry : " The land is dying , the land is dead , long live the land ! " It is shown with what artistry France has , until now , balanced her agriculture and her industry , the one by the other : it is in this harmonious balancing of the productive forces that the secret of our happiness and our virtues must be sought . Let 's not touch it , let 's not deprive the Good Lord of the desire to be French . Which means , of course : let 's maintain the numerical superiority of the country people over the workers . " When the ruling class exercises absolute power , " writes Mr. Sauvy , " it is populationist . . . When , for one reason or another , the ruled acquire rights and , as a result , the rulers acquire duties , the question changes its aspect . . . The rule being no longer absolute , the limitation of the number of births becomes , if not necessary , at least advantageous . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persuaded to prevent them from being born . Excellent advice , except that he has to carry it out : in a period of industrial boom , the multiplication of workers serves the interests of production . At the beginning of this century , the proletarians were frightening at a glance because they were too numerous ; but the true source of their new power is that they are not yet numerous enough ; the call for man power places value on them , provokes the raising of wages , limits the practical rights of the employers . Between 1871 and 1910 the 160 annual number of strikes went from 267 to 1,073 , and the percentage of successes wavers between fifty-five and sixty percent . The oppressed enjoy the advantages of both number and scarcity . And the anarchists join the employers in the field of birth-control propaganda , only because they are making Malthusianism a weapon of the class struggle . The French capitalists are betrayed by their own capitalism : this slave-type regime forces them to exercise a discriminatory power on the mass ; but at the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man power needs . Caught between the contradictory requirements of rule and gain , the employer tears his hair : how can he maintain profits without increasing production ? How can he sterilize the proletariat without provoking a rise in wages ? How can he make France a great industrial nation while conserving for it the population aspect of an agricultural country ? The answers are implicit in the questions , but our capitalists , caught between fear and the lure of gain , hesitate to look for them there : which is why one still finds two currents in the France of 1914 , one " populationist " and the other Malthusian , each of which corresponds to one of the terms of the contradiction . To all appearances , populationism was bound to win : the Government made it an official doctrine ; but this was hardly more than a hoax . Really to combat the fall in the birth rate , it would have been necessary to begin by obtaining a lower cost of living ; and since the bourgeoisie was firmly resolved to do everything possible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ministers was reduced to a declamatory hubbub and to ineffectual measures. * Meanwhile , everything indi- 161 cates that the bourgeoisie had secretly chosen the other solution . Surprisingly enough , it chose it for itself . The sudden proliferation of the outskirts of the city seemed to provoke a collapse of the urban birth rate . As if , having failed to castrate the poor , the rich had castrated themselves : bourgeois sterility strongly resembled selfsuppression , * Paris became the tomb of the race . About the same time , the Comite des Forges , while boasting of continuing " the magnificent progress of the preceding years , " made its first trials of economic Malthusianism . Everything was set : in 1914 , nothing remained but to construct the infernal machine which was to bind by a reciprocal conditioning the abortive schemes of industry to those of the bourgeois family . In order to persuade the employers , nothing less was necessary than the great shocks of the war and the postwar period . The elite perceived that civilizations are mortal : " Poor France , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ? " The universe did n't give a damn , as we all know , but these academic lamentations hid a real terror : and it was n't because of the war or of coal ; between 1917 and 1921 the employers had arrived at the certainty that the final victory would go to the proletariat . Not today , nor tomorrow , perhaps , but slowly , surely . . . it was an atrocious patent fact : yes , yes indeed ! Those bastards were going to win . In seventy years , the bourgeoisie had learned nothing and forgotten nothing and all the perfumes of Arabia could not wash the blood from its hands : it suddenly found itself the same as in 162 1848 , the same as in 1871 , with the same men confronting it , the ones who were massacred in the Commune , who were going to have to be killed in vain for the third time . This time they would win : and no one would pity the bourgeoisie , since it had not , in its hour of glory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bourgeois France began to speak about itself in deeply emotional terms . About itself , that is to say , about the human race ; for the bourgeoisie , to predict the end of capitalism is to predict the end of the world : since the worker is only a beast , the fate of man is in the hands of ants : when these prodigious hymenoptera take power , we will lose our worldly goods , our lives , our honor and all these delights which , only yesterday , were worth dying for ; the new lords will feed us to the lions , the kingdom of man will sink into the past . And let 's not count on history to do justice to us , even after the event : the ants will rewrite it . Our future is cancelled by this appalling catastrophe which will continue to destroy us after our death and which makes us in advance , in our own eyes , living dead or , rather , errors which have been explained and corrected . At the same period , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : it was , if I may speak in this way , the " healthy " reaction . If the Italians and the Germans , a century late , began the Saint Bartholomew massacres all over again , it was proof that they counted on winning and that they believed in capital . In the midst of these madmen , the old French bourgeoisie , burdened with years and crimes , looked defeatist . Napoleon III , the attempted coup of General Boulanger , the killings , the slow-death camps : the bourgeoisie experienced it all and , finally , it could say that none of it led anywhere . Capitalism produces its own death ; the proletariat resembles the Lerne hydra : cut off a head and ten new ones will sprout . You might as well not bother to cut off these swarming heads : it is better to try to find the way to make them , all of them , half-die . When the bourgeois of the South and East yelled : " To arms ! " the French bourgeois answered : " Temporize ; " when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " ours answered : " Undernourish ! " Yes , it is about time in our country for them to build the machine that will go around in circles : since the 163 progress of capitalism leads it to its own destruction , progress will be stopped ; since worldly goods must sooner or later pass into other hands , they will arrange to produce only the necessary and to consume all that is produced ; since the twilight of man has been announced to us , we will prolong his decline by manufacturing a twilight economy . Since competition drives towards producing more , competition will be strangled ; since , on days of riots , people from the working-class suburbs invade the streets of Paris , brakes will be put on technical concentration to slow down social concentration . We must , in short , stop history . For a moment . A very small moment . Our bosses intend to retard the cataclysm by a few decades in order to have time to die in peace . That does n't present any difficulty so long as one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a matter of acquiring new strengths , but of knowing how to use our weaknesses and of reinforcing each one by all the others . Does the market tend to shrink ? Perfect : its strangulation will be completed by raising prices . Do prices tend to rise ? The tendency will be accentuated by restraining production . Are raw materials lacking ? An excellent reason for the foreigner to take control . Are children scarce ? They will be made scarcer still if parents are reduced to despair ; economic Malthusianism bases itself on social Malthusianism and accelerates it : a child costs money before it brings in returns ; it is a new enterprise and necessitates new investments ; when the whole of France has an aversion to modernizing equipment , people are not going to amuse themselves by needlessly renewing the human material . And then what ? Frequently , economic revivals are accompanied by population upheavals : people wanted children because they were participating in a collective undertaking whose outcome the children would see . But we are waiting only for the deluge : why have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persuade the worker that France is going to die , that the fate of the son will be worse than that of the father : it is the best way of opening his eyes to his own interests . Thus , in the midst of the fascist uproar , our bourgeoisie organizes a slow suicide which will spread out over perhaps a half-century . When threatened , it first reacted by failure-behavior ; then it took hold of its 164 behavior and transformed it into defensive strategy . It was playing a losing game , it will therefore play " loser wins . " Our revolving economy will revolve more and more slowly and , one fine day , it will cease to turn altogether . But we will be dead ; if the Russians take it into their heads then to lay their hands on our beautiful France , they will find only carrion and will be properly cheated . French Malthusianism is to fascism , its Italian-German brother , what defense is to offense , passive resistance to action , feminine to masculine , pessimism to optimism ? in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the leaders must reestablish absolute domination over the led : but the Nazis sought to establish their power on the strength of their repressive apparatus ; the French bourgeoisie draws its power from a depressive ultraconservatism which reduces its class enemy to impotence . We have seen the disarray of the employers in the face of the numerical growth of the proletariat : " If it gets any bigger , it will eat us ; if it becomes smaller , industry might lack hands . " Malthusianism renders these fears needless : production stagnates when productivity tends to augment ; the conditions for technological unemployment are present ; the containment of the working class then seems desirable from every point of view . It is Malthusianism again , moreover , that furnishes the means of achieving this containment . The proletariat increases in an exaggerated manner because the workers have too many children and because rural inhabitants leave the land in too great numbers . Economic ultraconservatism will permit the regulation of both factors . First of all , births : from 1935 on , the employers won all down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those crude peasants obstinately kept the fecundity of beasts . But a few years of depressive economy sufficed to provoke the collapse of the workingclass birth rate : this time they understood ; they abstained , just like the bourgeois . People have sought to find the cause for this sudden recourse to Malthusian practices in the internal evolution of the proletariat . This is not false : the productive class has become more homogeneous and the workers ' sons are more numerous in it 165 than farmers ' sons . But the former have fewer children than the latter only because they have endured longer the ordeal of citybred misery and despair . It will be granted , of course , that they become more and more the product of this technological universe which they are producing and that little by little they are learning the techniques of life and death : the fathers were subject to the fatalities of the body , the sons know how to control it . But the control of births is only a means and one which can serve very different ends ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the new generations . It does not suffice to know about Malthusian practices ; it is still necessary to want to use them . Shall we seek the reason for this " abstentionism " in the inhuman requirements of mass production ? If you wish . But , in this form , the explanation remains insufficient since the same falling off of the birth rate is not registered in the advanced capitalist countries . The work of the semiskilled worker is always arduous ; for it to become entirely unbearable , new norms must be applied within the framework of a depressive economy . Instead , ask the workingclass couples why they do n't have more children : the answer is obvious : " We know our own sufferings too well to want to inflict them on others . " Condemned to live in the universe of repetition , they imagine no other future for their sons than their own past . Our criminal bourgeoisie becomes an abortionist ; it pursues with its tidy methods the work of its fathers : instead of massacring , it forces the adversary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rural exodus : it must be slowed down or compensated for or both . Nothing could be easier today : it is well-known that the peasant is not lured by the deadly candle flames of the city , but pushed and driven towards them by the excess of his misery ; let us guarantee him a misery without excess . The great emigrations of the nineteenth century are rich in lessons . The first , around 1860 , was due to the concentration of lands and to the consequent transformations of farming methods . Industrialists invented the peasants ' market ; they manufactured and sold plows and chemical fertilizers : the yield and the price of land increased , the demand for man power decreased , innumerable day-laborers were thrown 166 out on the highways ; others followed them , less badly off but with no more hope of one day becoming landowners . The lesson was understood : Malthusianism puts a brake on the mechanization of agricultural techniques in order to preserve small land holdings . It is known that transport takes up more than half of the time devoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very special solicitude by putting tractors beyond their reach and by keeping for them a good 800,000 kilometers of broken-down roads . Let them go on foot , let them scratch the earth 's crust with their old tools , let them plant with their bare hands : it is the best guarantee of social stability . It is true that social phenomena are circular ; and that it is just as much the smallness of the land holdings which retards the mechanization of techniques : the small farms are too tiny to profit much individually from motorization . Thus , the Malthusianism of industry finds its justification in the scarcity of demand . * But what if the peasants nevertheless banded together ? If they took it into their heads to buy tractors in common ? " In this domain , " say the specialists , " nothing will be done without their banding together . " But the point is that they do nothing : the regime has everything to fear from the social transformations that machines would introduce into rural areas . Fortunately , there is habit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their particularism is deplored , but it is protected undercover . The State does all that it can to save the precious peasant ignorance : in 1949 , the Minister of Agriculture received 471 million francs for agricultural education as against 14 billion to the Minister of National Education for technical education and craft apprenticeships . As a result , we lack 10,000 teachers . Thanks to this carefully maintained deficit , in France , two to three percent of the people in agriculture receive a technical education ; in Denmark , ninety-five percent . So there we are , completely at ease : the hoodwinking system becomes the goal of the hoodwinked . The machine revolves . The other great exodus of the last century ? that of 1880 ? was 167 the consequence of foreign competition . Our agricultural economy remained half closed down ; the development of communications put America at our doors and the New World dumped its food products on our markets . Prices collapsed : Our farmers took to the roads once again . Nearly a million men abandoned the soil . In order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measures were very hastily resorted to . But afterwards ? How could the recurrence of the disaster be prevented ? By increasing the yield ? It would be necessary to mechanize : progress would be exiled by one hand only to be reintroduced by the other ; in order to prevent the exodus of 1880 , they would be preparing for us that of 1860 . And then ? Take advantage of the climate to specialize in luxury farming as England specialized in high-quality industry ? Impossible : to specialize farming is to educate the farmer . And then you would be sure to get what you want to avoid : an exodus . In order to approach foreign markets , it would be necessary to mechanize , motorize , increase the yield , reduce man power , and the peasants would leave their village . Damned peasants : at the least progress , they hit the highway again ! Fortunately , Malthusianism provides the means to tie them to the land : since progress drives them off , they must be protected against progress . Let them produce wheat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price , by the most thankless labor , with the most backward technique : the call for man power will be all the greater the weaker the productivity of each worker. * An Atlantic wall is raised against outside competition , France is isolated from the world markets ; as to internal competition , it is easier still ; destroy it ; since the big farmers of the North and West can not put a brake on production as conveniently as the industrialists , the Government will help them : it buys their excess products only to distil them . In short , France makes a bonfire of its harvests and each Frenchman , 168 his stomach empty , pays to see the smoke . The State swallows up billions in the scheme , but the goal is attained : it is in France that bread costs the most* and that the farmer is the most ill-remunerated.f For this was the goal , no doubt about it : by maintaining our agricultural prices above world prices and our industrial prices above our agricultural prices , Malthusianism engenders and preserves through a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the French peasant , whom a self-serving propaganda tries to pass off as wise , who kills himself working in order to earn nothing , thinks he possesses a plot of land of which he does not even have the usufruct , defends the interests of the large landholders and votes every five years for his misery through fear of becoming even more miserable . This man of nature does not know that he is an artificial product and that his destiny , like that of the workers , is manufactured in the cities . But he is pitted against the cities by being reminded that his creditors live there , and above all he is pitted against the workers by being shown that their demands provoke the rise in industrial prices . If the peasant began to produce more and more cheaply , if he called for an increasing number of tractors at decreasing prices , he might come to realize one day that he and the industrial workers have common interests : which is precisely what is not wanted ; stability requires that the laboring classes be separated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary to divide to rule , the big employers support in the countryside at our expense a horde of noble savages whose votes back up their policies . One must not ask too much : Malthusianism restrains the chronic exodus of the rural inhabitants , it does not suppress it . Of 1,000 workers , in 1905 , about 480 were in agriculture ; only 370 were still so in 1930 ; in 1953 only 329 . Emigration still exists ; but its nature changes and it becomes oriented towards the minor administrative jobs . This is another effect of the depressive economy : in 169 debt up to his neck , dying of hunger on a mortgaged piece of land , the peasant wants security for his son ; he will make a civil servant of him . And then above all , technological progress gives rise to or develops a new class , whose rapid growth will counterbalance , then check , stop , and surpass that of the proletariat : the salaried middle class . It is well known that Colin Clark established , for most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national income and the proportion of unproductive ( or indirectly productive ) wage earners in the active population . To adopt his terminology , the secondary group and the tertiary group* increased together and in the same proportions up to the First World War ; this was the period in which capitalist industry was constituting both its cadres and the bulk of its man power . After 1918 , the growth of the tertiary accelerated , while that of the secondary slowed down . The universal development of offices and of administration corresponded to the effort of enterprises to reorganize themselves according to changes in technological progress and in industrial concentration ; they centralized services , " integrated " the different sectors of the business , eliminated bottlenecks , charged specialized teams with preparing and distributing tasks , with interpreting the confluence of factors and forecasting market fluctuations , and regulating distribution : the goal was to increase productivity by assuring control of production . Now , Clark 's plan is turning up again in France . Except that it has become a caricature ; in our country , production has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proletariat received its cutoff signal about 1931 , while the swelling of the tertiary kept becoming more pronounced. - This is the direct effect of Malthusianism : the manufacturer does not worry about increasing his 170 working personnel , since he is not thinking of producing more ; he increases his administrative personnel because he wants to rationalize the enterprise in order to produce at less cost . Result : an excess of 800,000 active persons in the tertiary and actual underemployment . If , in contrast , we want to satisfy the overall needs of the nation today , it would be necessary to raise production by forty-six percent : this is clearly impossible , but primarily because of the shortage of man power . Where are we to find the workers to construct the millions of lodgings needed ? And if we give ourselves a leeway of ten years , of twenty years , how are we to fill the gaps of the secondary sector short of drawing off man power from the primary and tertiary ? But the employers are very careful not to do so : they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France in a state of chronic anemia in order to put a brake on the development of the working class forces . Malthusianism did not miss its mark : a backward agriculture , an excess tertiary and a deficit proletariat are enough to assure social stability . And , naturally , the employers are in the clear : underproduction provokes underconsumption , i.e. , the shrinking of the market , which in turn justifies underproduction . All is for the best on the condition that we let part of the population freeze to death in the winter and starve to death all year long . A government which sought to increase the annual rate of productivity ? we have seen ? would have to relieve the congestion in the tertiary ; but the employers are completely at ease : it will not be accomplished tomorrow , and this draining off from the tertiary , although theoretically possible , is practically forbidden because of the social resistances it would arouse . Yet , the tertiary has its underpaid people whose salary is at best equal to that of a manual laborer : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any difficulty about passing from one sector to another if necessary . Well , it does n't work that way : the job makes the employee just as the frock makes the monk . By his buying power , the white-collar worker is allied to the productive wage earner ; he is 171 distinguished from him by the fact that he does not produce . The typist 's work is an integral part of management activities : in this way , she considers herself integrated with the ruling classes . In all truth , her functions do not separate her from the worker as much as she thinks ; of course , she does not produce , but after all it is she who gives materiality to instructions worked out in the offices . Thus , she seems to me very close to the typographer , who is a manual laborer . Conceptualization is the momentum of bureaucratic thought : thought denies the reality of things and its own reality , language denies the existence of the designated object : the bureaucrat keeps himself at the level of statistics , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which do not contain the germ of further ideas . Thought will rediscover its depth only by rediscovering materiality ; since it never transcends anything but objects , it will transcend itself only by receiving from the outside the objective character of an object . When she types a memorandum , the typist transforms the idea into thing , she brings about the reciprocal transcendence of the meaning by its materiality and of the material by the meaning . There is then in her work , as in that of the shipping clerk , or the postman , etc. , a productive character . But it is precisely this character which the white-collar workers want to deny : they believe they are participating in the elaboration of orders and tasks and pass over in silence their real function , which is to transform them by inscribing them in reality . By their behavior and by their aspirations , these " economic weaklings " of the tertiary mean to show their membership in the upper classes which oppress them . But they only ape their employers , and their attitudes clothe a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They have only a totally negative social reality , since they are not what they claim to be and since they reject all solidarity with those who resemble them most . It sufficed to effect a few deductions from the primary and secondary sectors to pit misery against itself by creating this whitecollar proletariat which detests the true proletarians because the working-class condition horrifies it . In the framework of an expanding economy , the harm would be less great : even if , as a whole , 172 the " services " continued to grow , the working masses would increase also ; the augmentation of national income and the demand for man power would help revalue the productive sector and encourage changeovers , as in the United States , where vast floating reserves of man power are massed on both sides of the borderline and are always ready to invade the tertiary or to flow back into the secondary , according to the combination of circumstances . But economic ultraconservatism implies social ultraconservatism : of 100 sons of workers born a quarter of a century ago , 55 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the land and work as agricultural laborers ; 35 crossed the line , of which 21 went to increase the ranks of the white-collar proletariat . In other words , a young son of a worker in 1930 had 65 chances out of 100 to remain a worker ; 86 chances out of 100 to stay within the less-favored classes . If we add to this the fact that the rural exodus has slowed down , that it is almost impossible for the lesser white-collar workers to raise themselves to bourgeois jobs , that the small employers are protected and kept at their post by the State and big industry , the inevitable conclusion is that our abortive economy has partitioned off social groups and made of France , if not entirely a caste system , at least a society in the process of stratification . The advantage is clear : Malthusianism is not satisfied with reducing the proletariat ? it succeeds in isolating it . Of course , people still enter the proletariat ; it still happens that people leave it : but , more and more , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not enough to hold this dangerous class off at a distance : it is necessary to hem it in . In the last century , the bourgeoisie lived in a state of siege ; today it contrives to besiege the working class group . Each clings to his position , to what he believes to be his privilege : the peasant his mortgaged land , the small employer his poor business , the minor white-collar worker his starvation job . The big boys direct everything ; they would need only to make a sign in order to ruin these little people , but they will be careful not to do so ; the little people are their allies , their soldiers . These men who differ from each other in every respect have a common hatred for the proletariat . Without that hatred , the small em-173 ployer would realize that he is the victim and accomplice of the captains of industry , the peasant that his land flees from him and flows away like water , the white-collar worker that he is being exploited by his employer . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers , which make industrial prices rise and augment the peasant 's debt , and which put the two-bit tradesman on the brink of ruin ; they see nothing but the sombre abyss which attracts and repels them . French employers weigh down two thirds of the nation in order to reduce the other third to impotence . They no longer seek to intimidate by massacres , but to weaken the combativeness of the workers from within ; they do not hesitate to shut the proletariat into a no-exit situation so well devised that the proletariat strangles itself or tears itself apart if it tries to get out . The encirclement of which I was just speaking is so far only a totally external success . There is more : since production produces the worker and since Malthusianism is the dominant characteristic of our production , the French proletariat is its victim and its product : we will see how the proletariat is conditioned in its very struggle by the evil it must struggle against . 1 . Our fathers tell us that France had its shock-proletariat between 1890 and 1911 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be recognized that the working class conducted more than 18,000 strikes during those twenty-one years . Counting them by year , one would immediately distinguish high and low points . But both are in constant progression : the ranges pass from 261 to 1,025 , and from 267 to 1,525 . Nor does the percentage of successful strikes cease to increase : it was fifty-three percent at the end of the century , and sixty-two percent in 1910 . This blessed epoch ended with the First World War : on an average , the post-war strikes have been more numerous . But until 1926 , the annual minimums and maximums are in constant regression and , above all , the success percentage falls from seventy percent in the year 1919 to thirtyfive percent in the years 1930-1935 . After the 1936 tidal wave , the number of strikes remained very high , but the tendency towards regression picked up again and became more pronounced : it still persists today and the success percentages are below average . Are 174 we really to believe that the workers were more courageous at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more devoted ? And what would be , in this case , the cause of the change ? The bourgeois commentators fidget at this question : " The cause , 0 my soul , the cause ? " There is only one : observe the triumphal rise of the proletariat up to 1919 , the blessed year when the worker had only to make a wish in order for it to be carried out , and consider what happened afterwards : the multiplication of failures , the recrudescence of misery , the collapse . 1920 was the crucial year . And why 1920 ? Because it was the year of the Congress of Tours and of the working class split ; from then on the proletariat has had its cancer . To say that the worker is losing his courage because the communist ulcer is eating away at him , is after all just too stupid . And yet it is true that a certain weakening of his action could be observed . Let us return to the facts and see what they reveal . First of all , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percentage increase with industrialization up to 1912 . We have noted , on the other hand , that this ascending curve included a few drops : there were times when strikes became less frequent , and each individually had less chance of success . The general curve of prices presents the same picture : a period of expansion does not proceed without minor crises . If we compare the two curves , it is obvious that the low points of both correspond exactly . From 1919 to 1935 , the tendency is reversed but the relationship does not change : * strikes increase with the rise in prices and decrease with their fall . The meaning is clear : in periods of rise , the worker is differently situated in society ; he is the object of a demand . This signifies that the national income is in full upswing and that the call for manpower would suffice to provoke the wage rise . If the working class tries to add to this rise through social agitation , it is because it demands a share of the collective enrichment . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draws its combativeness from the confluence of circumstances . Moreover , the competitive system 175 allows the workers to consolidate their victories : the concessions which the workers wrested from the employer could not be taken back ; if the employer had sought to compensate for the wage rise by manipulating a rise in prices , he would have been lost : he had either to renounce his profits or produce more : the praxis was adumbrated by the movement of the economy : snatched up by currents which threw him into full battle , the worker found himself acting again without having decided to act , and the efficacy of his acts was directly proportional to the expansive force of our industry . The proletariat carved out a future for itself in the future of capitalism . We know now that this happy period was to end with the 1918 Armistice . But praxis creates its own image of itself by projecting into infinity the immediate future which has engendered it : workers and employers , by simply moving to the extreme , had projected in front of them the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the proletariat pursue its conquest : it would constrain capitalism to produce ever more , and the proletariat would draw ever nearer to the point of taking power . This is what Jaures expressed around 1902 in terms which seem shocking to us today , but which expressed the common hope : It is impossible for the trade unions to organize , to spread , to become systematized without soon intervening in the functioning of capitalist society ... And the day when the workers ' unions , even by inspection , even by overseeing , intervene also in the setting up of mechanization , the day they advise , the day they impose on the employers such and such a machine , such and such a technical apparatus , they are collaborating with the employers in the management of the capitalist machine , whether they wish to or not . And indeed , I am not angry at the proletariat for this collaboration which is a beginning of the takeover . Thus the real but finite future of liberal capitalism was prolonged by an illusion of reality all the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own future . This false perspective stirred up the workers ' combativeness , while at the same time disposing the exploited , through the mirage of reformism , towards collaborat-176 ing with his exploiter . The workers had not forgotten the former Saint Bartholomews , but to the extent that the bourgeois world yielded to their action , the slogan of revolutionary syndicalism became a dead letter . Revolutionaries and reformists scarcely differed from each other any more except in language : when the Revolution appears at the end of continuous progress , what distinguishes it from simple evolution ? The proletariat remained hostile to politicians and to platforms , but it was inclined to come out of its voluntary exile , to infiltrate the enemy , to " make itself felt . " It had learned that the social phenomenon is , as Mauss says , a total phenomenon . But the objective truth of its struggle is that the struggle integrated the proletariat more each day into capitalist society and that it was to entail , finally , the subordination of the union organizations to the State . During @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its back to the wall . Could its courage have been taken away from it ? Certainly not . But if its combativeness is measured by the number of battles waged , it must be admitted that its combativeness decreases . This is because the strike has lost its efficacy . The unemployed constitute reserves on which the employer does not hesitate to draw ; and then , if his business is going poorly , he will use the existence of social conflicts as a pretext for closing it . Yesterday , the worker had his say on everything ; today , if he protests , he is thrown out in the street ; blessed if he at least spoke up before being fired . Yesterday , he was an integral part of the factory ; today , he feels that he is being tolerated there . It is not he , of course , who undergoes this devaluation , it is his labor power . This does n't prevent his feeling assailed in his human reality . He thought himself indispensable : they repeat to him now that only chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that there is , in a word , a kind of injustice in giving him work when so many others are refused any . By dint of hearing repeatedly that he is lucky not to be unemployed , the worker tends to consider himself an unemployed person who was in luck : in short , in times of crisis it is unemployment which gives work its meaning . Now , the unemployed person is a product of disintegra-177 tion , a passive citizen who has been driven back to the borderline of society and who is stingily supported in doing nothing in order that people will not say that he was left to die of starvation . Whether potentially or actually an unemployed person , the worker feels superfluous : the crisis strips him both of his powers and of his responsibilities . He had the illusion of " collaborating " with capitalism : he now realizes his impotence ; it no longer suffices to fulfill properly the work contract : if he wants to keep his place , he has to deserve it , to become what the foremen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moreover , the employers take advantage of the situation in order to select the personnel : they will fire the " hotheads , " the union members , the militants ; they will keep the others , those who are kept from protesting by resignation , fatigue and family responsibilities . Thus a kind of leavening process of the working class goes on : the best militants disappear , exiled into the no man 's land of unemployment . They lose both their means of action and their contact with the masses : among those who , in spite of their relative powerlessness , remain capable of exerting pressure on the employers , the proportion of those who are resigned tends to increase . The worker has lost the illusion of collaborating with capital : only yesterday , through his action in support of his demands , he was contributing to the expansion of industry ; at present , he undergoes the effects of the depression without being able to stay it : his progressive integration has brought him to share the responsibilities of his exploiters ; exile frees him but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which excludes him : that is what makes him particularly hostile to political demonstrations . " The consciousness of the working class , " writes Lenin , " can not be true political consciousness if the workers are not habituated to reacting against all abuses , all manifestations of arbitrariness whatever the classes which are victims of it , and to reacting properly from the social-democratic point of view . " 14 He is right no doubt , but it is infinitely easier " to inspire political revelations in the masses " in a period of industrial boom than in a time of crisis : between the masses and the ruling classes all ties are loosened , especially that of social struggle ; antagonism tends to give way to a relationship of pure juxtaposition. * Let us not go concluding that the proletariat has lost the memory of its infinite task : the truth of the matter is that the confluence of circumstances deprives it of any future by forcing it to stick to its immediate interests : it was fighting to conquer ; it is fighting to preserve . Never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the death of the other ; if capitalism intends to safeguard its interests , it must keep the proletariat below the subsistence minimum . Far from pushing industry to produce , the humblest demands risk driving it to ruin . And , in point of fact , if the crisis gets worse , it can lead to the Revolution , that is to the blow-up of an economy sapped by its internal contradictions . But this perspective itself often restrains trade union action : when the circumstances are not favorable to large-scale movements , a local strike risks being repressed by force or ruining the enterprise . The lesson will not be lost : the employers use the preceding observations as a basis for artificially achieving the objective conditions of workers ' discouragement . Does the number of strikes increase with production ? Then they will prevent production from increasing . If it falls below a certain level , are insurrectional disturbances to be feared ? They will make sure that production does n't decrease either . It will suffice to maintain the national economy in a state of latent crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law of wages is that the classes reflect each other : progressive employers , a shock-proletariat ; stagnating employers , a fatigued proletariat . In order to darken the workers ' consciousness , our industrialists have chosen to dim themselves ; they hope the atrophy of production will be lived internally by the 179 proletariat in the form of generalized anemia . Thanks to their practices , in fact , there is both too little and too much of the French proletariat . For an economy which would propose to fulfill all the needs of the nation by mass production , the proletariat is not large enough : Malthusianism thus keeps it in a state of underdevelopment . But for an economy which claims to have made itself depressive through fear of depression , the working class is liable at any moment to be too well supplied . In point of fact , crisis is our unique perspective , and the fear of crisis conditions everything . By surrounding itself with small business concerns as a safety device , large-scale industry suggests that catastrophe is at our doors ; the State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : it is not a question of making this catastrophe disappear entirely , but it can be deferred by an incessant vigilance . Our sole hope is apparently in the perpetuation of ultra-conservatism . Certainly , there is work for everyone but that is because the nation imposes cruel sacrifices on itself in order to prevent unemployment . The worker would be the first victim of an unfavorable combination of circumstances ; he is therefore the first beneficiary of governmental concern ; if it ceases to bar foreign products , he will find himself on the street again ; and if food products alone were let in , it would be the ruin of our farmers , the peasants would move to the cities again , and would swell the proletariat at the very moment when the industrial markets would be bearing the consequences of the collapse of agricultural prices . That is not all : take the employer himself ; his wage earners derive their employment from his benevolence . If he were to use foreign or colonial man power recklessly , discord and competition would be likely to divide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without increasing production , the proletariat would be hit by technological unemployment . De jure the French worker is an unemployed person ; he is not such de facto thanks to protection by the public powers and big business . He is therefore given to understand that our economy can collapse at the least puff . Let him strike if he wants : he has been warned that he has everything to lose . 180 He must also be convinced that he has nothing to gain by it . On this point , Malthusianism has done wonders ; the method was perfected around 1936 and still serves today . According to the Matignon agreement , " real wages should be readjusted according to a decreasing scale beginning at fifteen percent for the lowest wages and going down to seven percent for the highest wages . " As a matter of fact , it is not impossible that the total increase , under mass pressure , rose to twenty percent . The Government and the unions suggested to the manufacturers that they compensate for the increase in expenses by a production increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two-bit tradesmen who claimed they were poverty-stricken , they deliberately raised prices . From May to November 1936 , for industrial products alone , the index of gross prices indicates a rise of 35 percent . This rise continued throughout the Blum experiment ; it always remained higher than the rise of wages . In February 1937 , Leon Blum himself declared in a speech to the civil servants that : " The rise of the cost of living in the last eight months makes a wage earner 's household bear greater expenses than the advantages which all the measures taken in their favor have been able to procure for them . " From there on , they played loop the loop and the famous " infernal cycle of prices and wages " was set up . It goes without saying that it has been presented to us as an inexorable economic law . But this is a pure lie , and there is neither law , nor cycle , nor hell . The truth is that the " mass of consumable incomes " can not increase if production does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Readjusting wages achieves only a displacement of wages : the question is at whose expense this redistribution will be made . In a liberal system the employer must put up with the new expenses ; in a system of monopolies , he will have them borne by the consumer . The advantage is double : they pit the middle classes against the proletariat ; they divide and rule . And then they hoodwink the worker : whatever the rise in the nominal wage is in fact , buying power does not vary . Everything changes and nothing changes ; what they grant with one hand to the wage earners , the other hand takes back for their own pockets . After the popular 181 victory of 1936 , it did n't take the employers two years to bring the buying power of an hour 's work back to its 1929 level . Under the occupation , it fell lower still , and today , ten years after the liberation , it has not regained its 1938 level : for a quarter of a century , in spite of diverse fluctuations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has not budged : it ceased to increase at the same time as the national income and will begin again only when national income increases . That 's the conjuring trick which disconcerts the workers , and I do n't think I am insulting them in comparing them to those courageous bulls that charge the cape ten times and suddenly stop , disappointed at having met only a come-on . The worker does everything he can , he imposes hardships on himself in order to win the strike , he achieves victory exhausted , and all this just to witness a general price rise which puts everything back in place . Everything is done to convince him that it was n't worth his trouble : some manufacturers push impudence to the point of hastily raising prices in the cafeteria in order to be able to post the new prices the very day when the wage earners have got their increase . No more than an instant was needed to reverse the situation . Without a crisis and without massacres , the employers have worn out the workers ' combativeness : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on wages if he wants to , he has n't done anything if he does n't block prices ; but he knows very well that he will block prices only if he takes power , and the other classes seem totally deteniined not to let him take it . Must it be said that the proletariat , as in periods of crisis , is cut off from its future ? No : but we have seen that this future is first of all that of capitalism. * Now , the depressive ultraconservatism in our country gives to our temporality its two contradictory characteristics : repetition and involution . Repetition is the immediate appearance : the days follow each other and resemble each other . For three centuries , the sons were better nourished and better housed than the fathers , but during the last twenty-five years , 182 nothing has changed and the mass of goods to divide up has not increased . If there are people who live better , it is because there are others who live worse . All Europe calls us misers : and , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not even have the wherewithal to be miserly ; but neither does it apply to the middle classes . The meanness is in the system ; one must not see a national characteristic in it , but the collective situation which our lords have made for us . In the advanced capitalist countries , avarice is an individual chance-factor which the movement of exchanges upsets . But our Malthusianism discourages investments , and in our country money plays an eminently conservative role : since it is diverted from new enterprises , it drags us toward the older ones ; we are afraid of risks because we are prevented from taking them and we end up detesting what is new . It is true that we hang on to everything ; but that is because a future is being made for us which is an exact duplicate of our past . Americans throw things away before having worn them out : tomorrow products will be better and cheaper . In our country , the quality of merchandise will not change ; it will cost more , that 's all . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a magpie 's nest ? Wedding gowns , worn suits , outmoded hats , empty flasks , crumpled ribbons , bashed-in boxes , pieces of string : there are in our closets enough vestiges and monuments to retrace the history of half a century. * It seems that we insist on holding on at any price to a past which is falling apart : but the fact is we are afraid of tomorrow . This eternal recurrence hides a continual degradation : everything is being worn out ; people replace things parsimoniously and above all patch them up . The country is mildewing underneath : old houses in old cities , worn out machinery in old factories , old land and old habits , populations growing old , oldish children , children of old people . Meanwhile , the other countries , launched of an immense adventure , raise their steel walls around us. 183 It is they who are rising , of course : but it all looks as though we were descending . When everything is changing , it is necessary to change in order to remain the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , our economy engenders its own death , and it is this death which becomes our future : they repeat to us every day that our grandeur is behind us and that we are getting further and further away from it ; they praise to us some kind of a pleasant mode of life which we have n't known , which our fathers knew , perhaps , when the equipment was new . Ours is the time of recrimination and regrets ; France is Jeanne the Madwoman in bed with her putrefying husband . Bourgeois thought has fallen into prophetism : people are pleased to speak of Europe in " terms of destiny ; " they predict the deluge , but it is only a way of covering up the desire to die in peace : the deluge , yes , but after us . They tap on the walls , they sound out the floorings : it will all hold up until the final moving day . The workers labor and fight in this debilitating climate . They are not in despair ; and they are not contaminated by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even allowed to live in peace . But in this leaden future which is being fixed up for France , how would they not see their own future ? The world of manual labor has always been more or less one of repetition . At least the worker preserved , in a period of expansion , the hope of improving his lot ; at least misery and fury drove him , in a period of sharp crisis , to throw off the burden that was crushing him and to attempt revolution . But everything conspires today to convince him that his lot will not change , regardless of what he does . Benevolence is pushed to the point of explaining the situation to him several times a day : what does he expect ? Does n't he know that the national income is stagnant ? Of course , a more just distribution of wealth would be desirable ; the big employers would be willing to grant him certain satisfactions : unfortunately nothing can be done without ruining the small employers . And do n't they also have the right to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why should the proletariat be revolutionary ? It has something to lose . And why 184 reformist ? It has nothing to gain . The worker does not fall into these traps ; but , all the same , he can not help recognizing the degree of his powerlessness . True , he still believes in the Revolution ; but he only believes in it ; it is no longer his daily task ; he has lost the proud certitude of bringing it closer by his own efforts . He used to see in the ever increasing number of his local victories a proof of his power over the universe ; but Malthusianism , by blunting his weapons , has stripped him of his hold on the world ; he proved that he was n't afraid of the employers ? even the toughest ? or the State , or the C.R.S. ; but his principal enemy is a faceless , bodiless being that he ca n't manage to get hold of : price . In the course of these last twenty years , the unions have elaborated little by little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of the " sliding scale . " People have sought to see in these new ideas progress for the working class movement . But they were , quite to the contrary , born of Malthusianism : the ultraconservatism of our economy forces the worker to fight in order to maintain the status quo . That is what makes possible a better understanding of his present aversion to political demonstrations . For the political and social goals of the proletariat are progressive by definition : when the proletariat is in a position to impose its will on economic terrain , political action arises of itself : it is the meaning of the advances achieved in the day-to-day struggle . But when union action drags its feet , when the worker is reduced to the defensive , political ends set themselves apart in relation to economic ends ; they are likely to remain up in the air : precisely because they are advanced positions , the worker considers them from afar as hopes or desires , but he remains entirely cut off from them and he no longer finds the paths which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shown the repetition of his jobs and of his efforts ; if he persists in putting the Revolution last , how can he imagine that he is preparing it ? The world changes and France does not budge . The French proletariat wonders if it has fallen outside of history . In China , a new society is being organized ; in the U.S.S.R. , the standard of living is rising . The worker in our country hears this 185 news with mixed feelings ; it exalts his courage because it proves to him that social progress is possible , it depresses him because it seems to indicate that he is standing still , separated from his Russian and Chinese comrades by a continuously increasing distance and that salvation , if it ever comes , must come to him from outside . I will come back to this : but , at the moment , if we are to understand the worker , let us recall what we experienced under the occupation , when we were waiting for the Allies to win for us a war which we did not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Malthusian strategy permits the employers to keep the initiative : the depressive economy has command , from the outside , of the workers ' praxis , it roughs out the possible operations , it determines their characteristics , it delimits their range and meaning ; it determines the ends and the chances of victory . As soon as the worker gets involved in this prefabricated action , it clamps down on him : he discovers himself imprisoned in a contrived space which imposes on him its paths , its curvature , and its perspectives ; the discouragement of the proletariat is a product of industrial underproduction ; it subjectively expresses the objective limits which the structure of the economy imposes on praxis. 2 . Malthusianism , then , seeks to dishearten the worker . But that is not yet enough : one must divide in order to rule . Marchal has shown that between 1890 and 1936 the number of strikes increased and decreased at the same time as production . But he was the first to reveal a remarkable exception : from 1920 on , both the frequency of strikes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , until 1929 , our economy remained in a 186 state of expansion . The fact is explained by working-class dissensions , and this is not wrong . But where do these dissensions come from ? Ah ! I am told , from the war , from the socialist betrayal , from the Russian Revolution , from everything except from the Malthusianism which was not yet in practice when they appeared . Granted : union pluralism precedes industrial stagnation , and our Malthusians found the proletariat cut in half . But who says that they did not exploit this opportunity to the hilt and perpetuate a temporary state by reducing production ? The pre-World War I hierarchical proletariat was the product of the steam engine . The latter replaced muscle , but not skill ; it remained dependent : it had to be kept up , regulated , directed , watched over . The lathe relieved the worker from moving his tool and from applying it to the piece to be cut out : someone still had to prepare the job , fix the position of the piece , the angles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its very imperfections , the lathe defined the lathe operator : there are special profiles which the machine could not give and which had to be obtained by hand work and effected by means of auxiliary tools . The operation , and consequently , the operator , preserved in part an artisan character . Society trained the man the machine required : it conferred professional knowledge and technical experience on him through an apprenticeship of many years ; competition selected the best afterwards : those who showed proof of tact , or an ability " to size up , " of bodily dexterity , of initiative . But it was expensive to make a skilled worker : in a liberal capitalist system , it is the parents who must assume the major part of the costs . The peasants who have just left the land and the sons of unskilled workers do not have , for the most part , either the means or the will to do their apprenticeship. * Thus the requirements of the machine go so far as to prescribe the manner of recruitment . The skilled workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this aristocracy includes a few newcomers but most of its members have access to it primarily by birthright . To be sure , the elite worker is exploited right along with his comrades : but he differs from them because his competence singles him out to run a machine , he is the producer par excellence . As the principal agent and principal witness of the transformation of raw material into a manufactured product , he becomes self-aware in the fashioning of the inert thing . For him , apprenticeship represents much more than technical training : he sees in it a revolutionary initiation and a rite de passage which grants him access to his caste and to the working world . The machine , too , assures the unity of the work group , or rather it is assured by the complex and synthetic operation that the skilled worker carried out by means of the machine and with the assistance of the other workers . In a mechanized enterprise , at the beginning of the century , out of one hundred workers there were about twenty " machinists " who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves to installation and adjustment ; there were about 60 drillers or punchers , lathe , stamping and milling machine operators , skillful and competent workers but who were far from having the former 's training , finally about 20 unskilled workers who lived apart from the machines and who took no part in the manufacturing . The machinist directed both his machine and his men ; the semiskilled workers who surrounded him he called his " accessories , " whom he had " do odd jobs " for him ; the unskilled workers , too , obeyed him : they spared him the dirty jobs . This technical hierarchy was underscored by the hierarchy of wages : the skilled worker earned seven francs when the " work horse " earned four . During this period , people began to speak of " the masses " to designate the working class , and they were wrong : the masses are amorphous and homogeneous , the proletariat of 1900 was profoundly differentiated , the hierarchy of labor and wages was met again intact on the social and political terrain . The simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to constitute " the masses " : it is by abstraction that one could separate them 188 from the other workers , and each of them is more narrowly tied to his shop comrades than to the other unskilled workers of the factory and the city ; the working class is constituted by a multitude of solar systems , small structured groups that gravitate around a machine . These work teams communicate via the top : the form of the trade-union apparatus is determined by the composition of the working class : in 1912 , France had more than six million manual workers and the C.G.T . only 400,000 members . Nonetheless , strikes were tough , expeditious , and disciplined , and they succeeded most of the time . That means that one militant was in general enough to pull along about fifteen nonunionists . In the struggle for their demands , the skilled workers kept the authority they enjoyed during work . Not all of them , however , since only one out of three joined the union : the best among them , those who had had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their revolutionary will the clearest consciousness of the workers ' condition . To the steam engine corresponded a hierarchical proletariat which in turn produced a skeletal unionism with the shop as its base , the enterprise for its battlefield and the elite worker as its militant . It seems that those were the good old days : a quarter of a century after its demise , our fine friends discovered revolutionary syndicalism and never cease to hold it up to us as an example : in the golden age of the Congress of Amiens , the bureaucracy did not exist ; the union apparatus emanated directly from the proletariat and resided in it as a simple internal principal of organization ; the defense of the workers ' interests was assured by the workers themselves ; one was militant without leaving the shop , hence without losing contact with the concrete problems of the enterprise . In point of fact , the Bergsonian general staff of the C.G.T . made itself the champion of spontaneity : it was Pelloutier who evoked a " mysterious bond " uniting the workers ' organizations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action " of French unionism ; the union Self ( Moi ) , in sum , plunged its roots into the inner Self ( Moi ) of the proletariat . 189 Before the First World War , the class struggle had a certain something . Of course , this is stuff and nonsense : the elan vital of the working classes concealed the dictatorship of the skilled elite . The " active minority " scorns what it already calls " the mass " and detests democracy . " It is not , " says Lagardelle , " the heavy and backward mass which must express itself here , as in a democracy , before undertaking the struggle ; numbers no longer make the law . But there is formed an active elite which , by its quality , carries the mass along and orients it in the paths of combat . " Let us translate : the " upper " stratum of the proletariat takes the responsibility of setting forth both its own demands and those of the " less favored " ; this elite aspires to be sole judge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular resistance than to break it . I will not do the injustice of claiming that these admirable fighters have betrayed their class ; if they distrust their comrades it is because they suspect them of being more sheeplike than revolutionary . They have maintained constant concern for reconciling their interests with those of the unskilled workers , and , at the beginning at least , in a prosperous country in the process of industrialization , these reconciliations were not too difficult . They became more and more infrequent in the last pre-war years . The workers ' struggle has two sides to it : for the active minority , it is a concrete experience and an instrument of liberation ; for the majority which follows the active minority , it often remains an abstract imperative . And when the militants involve the unskilled workers in an action for their demands , one can well say , with our fine friends , that the working class united in action and that its unity remains immanent . In fact , more and more frequently the militants struggle on two fronts : against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the top , however , one finds a handful of militants whose views are broader and who proudly call themselves " active minority " : against the particularism of the elite , they aim at defending the general interests of the class . But when it tries to convert the skilled workers to industrial unionism and to centralization , this minority 190 goes against the current . The working-class aristocracy remains favorable to " anarchistic administration " and to craft unionism , The Pelloutiers , Pougets , Merrheims , Monattes would have lost the game without the sudden conversion of industry . 1884 : the first practical transformers made their appearance . Ten years later the electric motor competed everywhere with the internal combustion engine , and encouraged mechanization : technological progress gradually reduced the part of the worker in manufacturing , which led to the progressive downgrading of skilled manual labor . The new lathe produced new lathe operators : it needed only a flick which was transmitted by itself to the executing mechanisms . Suddenly , between the unskilled workers and the near-skilled , that unknown person , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machines like a skilled worker and fulfilled his function without serving an apprenticeship , * like an unskilled worker . He had already been around , of course , but no one had noticed him . Where had he come from ? From everywhere : he might be a country lad who had just arrived in the city , but most often he was an unskilled worker from another industry . As out of 250 workers ; all the others are former miners or former weavers ; * they have in their hands improved machines which render professional knowledge useless . " 15 These newcomers were still timid : they had neither the time , nor the will , nor the strength to organize by themselves ; they called for the help of the skilled and militant elite . In 1912 , Merrheim , at the national C.G.T . Congress at Le Havre , attributed this speech to a metalworker from the East : " How can you expect us poor metalworkers , who are tired in the evening when we get home , to concern ourselves with the union ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers , have created craft unions . " 191
