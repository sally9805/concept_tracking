txt Letters to The Times To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I believe that the editorial position taken by The Times on Jan. 17 , that we withhold aid from governments committed irrevocably to dictatorship but assist those striving to build democracy , though their governments be initially dictatorial in character , is essentially sound . Many persons committed ideologically to democracy overlook the fact that the practice of democracy within a nation requires a level of socioeconomic development and political sophistication not usually found in under-developed nations . It calls for literacy , good channels of communication ( including no  --  or low  --  language barriers ) , dependence on a legal system for the enforcement and protection of rights , a trained administration and the existence of national political parties . Such institutions are not usually found among peoples organized along tribal lines , with different languages and cultures , living in an economically under-developed area . Use of Nationalism In the present state of the new and under-developed nations it should not surprise us to see a strong , blatant and sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and direct their loyalties and energies toward common goals . The new states will have to centralize political authority , develop a single language , or relatively few languages , control economic activity on a national basis , and gradually cut through custom and cultural barriers . Progress toward democracy is apt to be slow , and not always direct . In the beginning the strong ruler appears likely to emerge as the symbol of national aspirations and the coordinator of national effort . Ghana 's Nkrumah is typical : in a country where there are 100 different tribes he has made himself the center of national ideals and tolerates or encourages pictures and statues of himself throughout Ghana . At this point , while he professes democratic aims , he shares neither adulation nor authority with other leaders . President Sukarno of Indonesia , where 137 different cultural and racial groups are said to exist , has likewise made himself a strong man and has utilized the issue of " West Irian " against the Dutch to foster national feeling among his peoples on their scattered islands , Other nationalistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nasser of Egypt and Gursel of Turkey . India 's Difficulties At first glance India , with its British-trained civil service , its inherited democratic institutions , its tradition of nonviolence , appears to be a likely exception among new nations , Yet even here the fourteen languages , fourteen states and six territories of the country provide difficulties to national unity and achievement , and the recent actions of Nehru with respect to Goa indicate that this disciple of Gandhi is not above using aggression and territorial acquisition to spark national feelings and obtain internal support . The United States will have to exercise patience with respect to these new nations and their authoritarian rulers basking in the " cult of personality . " Aid must not be withheld , but must be extended judiciously to assist them to make the transition from Stone Age to industrialism , and from tribalism to broad-based democracy . To do otherwise would lead them in seeking aid to turn to the Communist world , and to risk losing whatever chance they have to develop in an atmosphere of freedom and independence .

Redistricting in the Bronx TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : With reference to your Jan. 25 editorial comment on Paul Fino 's newly created and ostensibly gerrymandered district in the Bronx , I wish to disagree with your overt manifestations of condemnation and your more subtle innuendoes . I feel that the only possible , plausible attack on the lines of the district as they newly stand has reference to the long , narrow strip cut out of the district which comes close to dividing it in two . For certainly if this thin strip had been included within the district , there could be little cause for objection . As for the elimination of most of the municipal housing projects , these were located on the old borders of the district . Their tenants did not Services of Agency for Voluntary Sterilization Offered To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YoRx TIMES : We read with interest in your news columns of Jan. 24 of Welfare Commissioner James R. Dumpson 's justifiable concern for " the perpetual crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he requests increased budget , staff and services to care for the 20,000 neglected and dependent children now " vegetating " in hospitals , shelters and foster homes . Truly , the needs of both city and private agencies are immense . But while Commissioner Dumpson seeks increased staff and budget which will merely " hold the line , " he has neglected the cause of the problem  --  the mothers and fathers of these hapless children . The Human Betterment Association , an effective twenty-year-old organization with a program of education , research and direct aid in the field of voluntary sterilization , recommended only when other methods of birth control have proved ineffective , has informed the Commissioner of its availability as a " recognized community resource , willing to assist at the very heart of the problem * * * . We stand ready to help , but this fact is withheld from those who need us the most . We feel that there is a deprivation of human rights in this area . " To which the Commissioner replied " 8 * * I do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ department is depriving a client of a ' human right ' * " . There is nothing that prevents an individual from using any resource or service in the community he wishes to use . " We question whether the Commissioner relies on his welfare clients to find these resources and make their own appointments for other health problems . It is unlikely that his clients would know where to turn or have any idea how to proceed . How will they be able to find and use the Human Betterment Association without being told of its existence ? All that we ask of Commissioner Dumpson is that he help hundreds of welfare cases wishing to terminate their fertility , to help themselves , by informing them of the Human Betterment Association and its medical and education services . All cases are carefully screened by our Medical Committee before a sterilization is performed . FRANCES HARD FERGUSON , Chairman , Human Betterment Association of America , Inc . New York , Jan. 30 , 1962 . Reservists Charge Inequities To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YoRx . TIMES : As members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protest . While we mark time in an Army camp , our prom . ised replacements await the draft . Draft calls , however , have been reduced to pre-crisis levels . In addition , fully trained personnel currently are being released after only six months of active duty . Thdusands of fathers are now serving for the second time while fathers with no prior service are automatically exempted from the draft . We have been separated from our wives and children , our careers have been disrupted , and we are incurring severe financial hardships . We are not " freeloaders , " we are not " cry-baby Reservists , " we are not serving in the Reserve forces for the money . We are average young Americans who want to return to a normal life as soon as possible . When will we be able to do so ? We ask that the Administration give us a definite date for release . We ask that the abovelisted inequities be corrected . We ask that the burdens of military service be shared more equally . 100 MEMBERS OF 431ST ORDNANCE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1962 . Aid for New Nations Attainment of Democracy Called Slow and in Need of Assistance by any means have a community of interest with most of the other residents of the district . I think it worthy of note that the district does contain one very large development ? Metropolitan Life 's Parkchester ? . which was the first and continues to he the largest of New York City 's apartment house developments . Lastly , you might in passing note that New York State 's Republican gerrymandering is hardly a unique example of partisan tactics . The Democrats are doing a sterling job here in Massachusetts , where some of the new districts resemble tortured centipedes ; in California , where they have more curves than a Hollywood starlet , and in North Carolina , where they have been doing the twist far longer than the people in New York .
