In the shipyards of Queens Island , Belfast last week , joiners , painters , decorators and electricians were swarming over the newly launched , most luxurious superliner of Britain 's maritime fleet . It is the Peninsular &; Oriental Steam Navigation Co. ' s 45,000-ton , $42 million superliner , Canberra . Sailing for P. &; O. , which coined the word " posh , " - the 740-ft . Canberra will be one of the poshest ships afloat , with a cruising speed of 27 knots , air conditioning throughout , and closed-circuit television for passengers while the ship is at sea . Designed with an aluminum superstructure to save weight , and engines aft to give passengers more deck space , the liner will carry as many passengers as Cunard 's Queen Elizabeth . It will have almost three times as many tourist as first-class passengers ( 1,650 to 600 ) to entice budget-conscious travelers . <P> The Canberra joins the largest merchant and passenger fleet in the world , controlled by the 27-company P. &; 0 . group , with 370 ships ( 2,342,028 g.r.t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Suez Canal to Australia , then across the Pacific to Vancouver and San Francisco , finally home via the same route . With her sister ship , the still-building , 40,000-ton Oriana , the Canberra will give P. &; O. a commanding lead in Pacific passenger travel . Since it first sailed in these waters in 1954 , P. &; 0 . has undercut the luxury-minded Matson and American President lines by emphasizing low-cost tourist-class rates ; next year alone , the company will boost its berth facilities for Pacific travel by 60% . <P> <P> War 's Toll . P. &; O. began operations in 1837 with two small paddle steamers and an Admiralty charter to carry the rhails to Spain and Portugal , soon extended its routes beyond the Iberian Peninsula to India and the Orient . When World War I began , the company laid plans for expansion to meet the expected shipping shortage at war 's end . Though the Admiralty took over P. &; O. 's fleet , the company bought up seven of its competitors , by 1919 controlled half a million more tons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its own ships had been sent to the bottom . <P> P. &; O. managed to weather the squalls of the Depression , but in World War II the company was almost swamped when 1.187,548 tons of its shipping was sunk . It began a 70-ship rebuilding program at the end of the war , branched into other areas of transport , laid the keels for 14 new oil tankers costing some $112 million , bought an aviation subsidiary , British Aviation Services , that last year ferried more than 67,000 cars and 193,000 passengers across-the English Channel . <P> Profits Down . With lots of ships , P. &; 0 . also has lots of problems . This week it got a new man at the helm to cope with them . Sir Donald Anderson , 53 , who started with P. &; O. in 1934 , took over from Sir William Currie , 75 , as P. &; O. chairman .
