As his State of the Union message clearly demonstrated , no one more intuitively senses the mood of Congress than Lyndon Johnson . And , unlike the obedient Democratic 89th , which acquiesced in almost every Administration whim , the 90th Congress will offer far more contention than consensus when it comes to the President 's legislative proposals . Johnson recognized as much in conceding before the new Congress : " The genius of the American political system has always been best expressed through creative debate that offers choices and reason able alternatives . " <P> The 90th could well become the Debating Congress , skeptical of Administration policies both domestic and foreign . Most of its members are well into their middle years ( average age 52 ) ; over half are lawyers ; 88% have served in a public capacity before coming to Congress ; 69 are eager first-term freshmen . Not since the Eisenhower landslide of 1956 have Republicans held such congressional strength . There are five new G.O.P. Senators and 47 new Republican Representatives . The Democrats ' Senate margin is still a comfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from last session 's 154-vote majority to a 246-187 advantage . Thus the House G.O.P. delegation needs to woo only 30 Democrats to win a majority on any issue . <P> Another reason for optimism among <P> Republicans is the dwindling effectiveness of the Democratic leadership , particularly in the House , which holds the ultimate key to the legislative record of the 90th Congress . Restive Democrats ignored the party line laid down by 75-year-old Speaker John McCormack and Majority Leader Carl Albert ( under doctor 's orders to ease up after last year 's heart attack ) , in refusing to seat Adam Clayton Powell ( see following story ) . Earlier , a Democratic caucus had flouted McCormack 's wishes and voted to kick out the Clerk of the House , Ralph Roberts , a widely disliked 16-year veteran in that post . <P> McCormack and Albert suffered an other defeat on the House floor when Republicans , led by Gerald Ford , mustered a 224-196 vote against a Democratic move to adopt the same procedural rules that had governed the 89th Congress . It was a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear portent of the ambuscades ahead . <P> <P> President Johnson has also divined the latent obstacles , and in his State of the Union address he pointedly avoided several prickly proposals that could stir up the membership . These included repeal of the Taft-Hartley Law 's famed 14-B ( right-to-work ) section , rent subsidies and tough new civil rights proposals .
