Last February , New York Mayor John Lindsay trudged through the unplowed streets of snowbound Queens absorbing the taunts of angry householders . " Just try to get elected again ! " yelled one woman . Trying to do just that , Lindsay last week returned to the same territory in a strange , triumphal procession . Surrounded by an honor guard of garbagemen aboard new snowplows , Lindsay soothed housewives with promises that they would never be snowbound again . The natives , while still skeptical , were nevertheless far friendlier than they had been last winter - and even friendlier than only a few weeks ago . <P> The incident was no isolated phenomenon , and illustrated what is shaping up as a comeback of Trumanesque proportions . Just two months ago , Lindsay 's re-election chances were being written off as almost hopeless . Reviled in much of his own city , the target of a middle-class revolt that had anti-Negro undertones , rejected in the Republican Party primary , the ambitious , activist mayor seemed almost destined to lose . Waiting to restore Democratic rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself the champion of the " average man " ( TIME cover , Oct. 3 ) . <P> Big Bloc . By September , it was clear that Lindsay 's free-spending , fully professional campaign was picking up speed . Few politicians were aware of just how much . Last week they were shocked when the respected New York Daily News poll showed Lindsay leading Procaccino by 47% to 31% , with 19% for Republican-Conservative John Marchi and 3% undecided . As everyone expected , Lindsay scored heavily among blacks , Puerto Ricans and well-educated , upper-income groups concentrated in Manhattan . The surprise was the mayor 's strength in the populous outer boroughs , with their heavy concentrations of middle-income whites . <P> The key factor in the impressive showing was the Jewish vote-of which Lindsay received 54% . From the beginning of the campaign , politicians have agreed that the outcome would hinge on Lindsay 's ability to win back Jewish voters , who constitute the largest single bloc in the electorate . Jews were alienated by Lindsay 's backing of a school-decentralization plan that led to last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jewish teachers union . And , like other middle-class whites , they felt neglected by city hall . In a major fence-mending effort , Lindsay stepped up city services , particularly in the police and sanitation fields . <P> He visited synagogues and Jewish neighborhoods to reassure residents of his concern for their problems . Lindsay 's lean , 6 ft. 3 in. frame , topped by the inevitable yarmulke , became a familiar sight in the outlying boroughs . The grand reception given to Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir led to the appellation " Meir " Lindsay .
