To the casual tourist on an afternoon outing , Bermuda seemed the same old happy , fun place . Old folks milled through the gleaming pastel shops on Hamilton 's Front Street ; honeymooners buzzed about the island on rented motorbikes and lounged on beaches or around hotel pools . But after dark , Bermuda took on a new atmosphere . Everyone was ordered off the streets , and soldiers threw up barbed-wire barricades . Extra police patrolled the downtown area . Lights blinked late on the newly arrived British troop frigate , H.M.S. Leopard , which bobbed at anchor in a Front Street berth normally reserved for cruise ships . Thus last week Britain 's oldest colony uneasily approached its May 22 elections , the first in the island 's 284-year history in which everyone over 21-both Negro and white-will be allowed to vote . <P> Notable Strides . The reason for the tension was an attempt by the island 's six-year-old , predominantly Negro Progressive Labor Party to turn the elections into a bitter racial contest with the ruling United Bermuda Party . The United Bermuda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ businessmen and white Establishment . Like their distant neighbors in the Bahamas , Bermuda 's Negroes constitute a majority ( 63% ) of the island 's 50,000 people ; yet , unlike the Bahamas , Bermuda under the United Bermudians has made notable strides in integrating the island 's life . <P> Led by Sir Henry Tucker , a Hamilton banker , the United Bermudians took power in 1963 , and since then have banned all segregation , expanded educational spending 250% and broadly integrated their own party . Last year they presided over a Constituent Assembly that drew up a new constitution , lowered the voting age from 25 to 21 and put far more power in the hands of the elected government . At the same time , they have also expanded the tourist industry and brought prosperity to black and white alike . There is now one telephone for every two persons . Some 90% of the island 's 12,000 families have a car and a television set . <P> State of Emergency . The Progressive Laborites , however , claim that progress has not come fast enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in government and that there is still de facto social segregation , want to limit the number of white immigrant workers from Britain . " It is going to really get hot this summer , " Parliamentary Candidate Austin Thomas warned a rally in Hamilton two weeks ago , " and it is going to be P.L.P. heat . " A few hours later , a band of teen-age Negro hoodlums began throwing bottles and rocks at some police on Front Street . When more police reinforcements arrived , a full-scale riot erupted . <P> Over the next two days , rioting and looting spread over a ten-block area of Hamilton , causing $1,000,000 in damage and leaving seventeen persons injured . Bermuda 's British Governor , Lord Martonmere , declared a state of emergency , imposed a curfew and asked for-and received-365 additional troops from Britain . All seemed quiet again by last week , but , like the scent of hibiscus , tension hung heavy in Bermuda 's balmy air .                   @ @
