Although his government is broke , young King Hassan II has managed-with French and U.S. aid-to start a sugar refinery at Sidi Slimane , a dam on the Moulouya River , a terraced agricultural complex in the rough Rif country , and new tourist hotels along the coast . More important , Hassan has pushed his country toward democracy , with free elections and a freewheeling legislature . Is all this really enough ? No , suggested the mobs that swept down the labyrinthine alleys of Casablanca with the violence of the harmattan , Morocco 's fierce desert wind . <P> The uproar moved through the steep hills of Fez and the souks of Marrakesh , where angry mobs cursed the government , burned police stations and sacked shops . Police and troops hit back in panic with machine guns and rifles , cracking skulls with clubs the size of baseball bats . In the rebellious cities , at least 100 rioters died ; 844 more were arrested and given speedy prison sentences . Fourteen Moroccan leftists sentenced to death last year for fomenting revolution were hastily sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissuading the rioters from further action . It seemed to work . Last week an unsteady truce hung over the country as King Hassan tried to figure out what had happened . <P> Urban Impatience . The riots were triggered by a government edict that would have shunted failing students over 17 into technical curriculums . Only 300 of Morocco 's 62,000 high school students were affected , but the innocuous announcement was enough to touch off a powder keg of underlying discontent . Unfortunately , Moroccans have plenty to be discontented about . <P> With the population only 20% literate , a per-capita annual income of $160 and an average life expectancy of 40 years , Morocco is scarcely more advanced than many parts of black Africa . French , U.S. , West German and Italian money is providing Morocco with everything from dyeing and shoemaking plants to Caravelle jetliners to chemical , electrical and arms factories . Despite outside help , a sharp economic decline over the past eight months has cost 100,000 Casablancans their jobs , bringing the city 's total unemployment up to 400,000 . That brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarter of the population . <P> More than half the population is under 20 and eager for schooling . But Morocco 's $85 million annual education budget is not nearly enough to bring scholarship to so vast and desperate a student body . As a result , students and labor leaders , intellectuals and urban workers have grown increasingly impatient with Hassan 's reluctant moderation and economies-and increasingly sympathetic with the instant socialism of such Arab leaders as Algeria 's Ahmed ben Bella . <P> Regal Candor . Fortunately for Hassan , neither of the nation 's two major leftist opposition groups has yet taken overt advantage of the riots . The Union Marocaine du Travail , Morocco 's socialist , urban-intellectual labor union , staged an 18-hour sympathy strike for the rioters . But discipline was poor-largely because the U.M.T. did not know what the riots were all about . And the Union Nationale des Forces Populaires , which holds nearly a fifth of the seats in the National Assembly , was equally befuddled . Had the two combined forces , Hassan might have been in real trouble .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
