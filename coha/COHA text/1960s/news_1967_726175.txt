txt Every morning at 5:30 the people of Hanoi march out of their homes for their daily exercises . Men and women  --  young and old alike  --  file onto the streets and sidewalks where enthusiastic block leaders urge them through the regular workout . Thus dawns another day in the austere and highly disciplined state of North Vietnam . Such is the picture of the North which emerges from interviews with recent visitors and scores of official and unofficial reports on the Communist half of Vietnam . Just as other new Communist states have done , North Vietnam drives its people hard , demands self-sacrifice , and offers little in return except a hope of eventually " building socialism "  --  and a pride in fighting the most powerful Western nation in the world to a draw . Western observers of Communist nations over many years say that North Vietnam certainly ranks as one of the most severe , tightly knit Communist regimes in history . Hanoi 's official newspapers and radio broadcasts continually call for sacrifices from the country 's 17.9 million people . One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been the program of the " three postponements . " Youths are urged to " postpone falling in love . " If that is not possible , they should at least " postpone getting married . " Or fail* // *Discipline tight in North Vietnam // ing both of these , they should " postpone having children . " Since women have become crucial to fill manpower gaps in factories and in the rice paddies-70 percent of agricultural labor consists of women  --  childbirth is seen as a big obstacle to output . In addition , the population growth rate of 3 percent per year has called for increased civilian production which the war-strained economy can ill afford . Besides the three postponements , the government has launched a new program of sterilization and is also distributing birth-control pills . Young women have recently been requested to sign papers promising to delay marriage for a few years . Humans pulls plows The pressing need for workers has led the government to give almost everyone some sort of task . Recent reports indicate that the farms have not yet been able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tractor . As a result , in many cases human labor has been substituted for an- . imal power for heavy jobs like plowing . The shortcomings in agricultural production are so serious ' that experts now estimate North Vietnam may need to import up to one million tons of rice this year from China , as well as grains from other Communist countries , to provide proper diets for its population . To counteract food shortages , rationing was instituted several years ago , and although it has become tighter , it has apparently been accepted with good spirit by the people . Ration cards are needed to buy rice , sugar , cloth , meat when available , condensed milk , cigartttes , cakes , fish , sauce , clear noodles , spaghetti , and tea . Residents report the rationing is carried out quite fairly by the government .

Fish , ducks , and vegetables are reportedly in good supply , but rice is scarce and expensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equals only a substandard 1,700 to 1,900 calories . The widespread shortage of food adds to the general austerity , which extends from the countryside right into Hanoi . Visitors to Hanoi note that shops are very short of goods , and much of what is on display is shoddy . Household goods , for the most part , are either of local manufacture or from mainland China . Other bloc products are rarely seen . While the streets of Saigon buzz with thousands of shiny , newly imported motorcycles , the streets of Hanoi have few motorized vehicles . The only cars belong to the government , the International Control Commission , or embassies . In contrast , the streets of Hanoi swarm with bicycles in a density resembling the Netherlands or Denmark . One-station radios Even these bicycles are expensive by North Vietnamese standards . About $180 , or four months ' wages for a skilled worker , is the cost of a locally manufactured bicycle . Radios with a choice of station are also expensive .

Trash is rarely seen in the streets there  --  in sharp contract to Saigon . Families separated Nevertheless , Hanoi has a down-at-heel appearance . Falling plaster and peeling paint are everywhere . One recent visitor said he could not remember a single construction project under way within the city , and under war conditions it is unlikely that any new building is planned . Visitors report that the people of Hanoi are somewhat dispirited because of the evacuation of many dependants as a protection against possible bombing attacks . This separation from their children and families remains one of the greatest hardships for city residents . Many of the children were returned to the city for the lunar new year 's holidays , observers report , and the government has encountered some opposition to moving the children out of the city again . Despite all the hardships of everyday life , however , the Hanoi leadership appears to be maintaining a strong control over its citizens .
