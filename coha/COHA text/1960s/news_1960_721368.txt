txt " I think this is something like teaching the young to use narcotics  --  I think it is very bad , very bad Indeed . " The subject of this dire pronouncement , made before a Congressional subcommittee by Earl B. Schwulst , president of the Bowery Savings Bank here , is a controversial new wrinkle in retailing : Charge accounts for teen-age customers . Ringing rebuttals of Mr. Schwulst 's stand are hurled by proponents of on-the-cuff buying by the younger set . " We 're in a credit economy now , and the sooner these kids know how to handle credit , the better off they 'll be , " declares A. Leonidas Trotta of the National Retail Merchants Association . Charge Accounts Spread While the dispute boils , use of charge accounts to snare the patronage of youngsters in their teens continues to spread . A recent ' levonteen Magazine survey of 217 department and specialty stores found 63% had some form of credit plan for teen-agers , up from 32% in a similar study in 1959 . Merchants have a double-barrelled purpose in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : They seek to steer youthful customers into the habit of shopping at their stores , with the hope the habit will stick in the years ahead when today 's teenagers have grown up and are spending on a bigger scale . The other aim is simply to grab a larger share of the growing teen-age market . Market researchers figure this market now comprises more than 19 million youths between the ages of 13 and 19 . Having grown up in generally prosperous times , these young people tend to be a free-spending lot . This year , for example , they 're expected to pay out close to $10 billion for items ranging from cashmere sweaters and banana splits to hot rod accessories and Elvis Presley records . The biggest single outlay in this 1960 spending  --  something over $3 billion  --  will go for girls ' apparel . In the next 60 days alone , teen-age girls are expected to engage in a back-to-school spending spree that will cost them and their parents nearly $1 billion . Usual Minimum Age : 15 It 's primarily this lush market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in offering teen charge accounts . The charge plans , bearing enticing names such as " Starlet Circle Charge Account " or " Campus Deb Account , " generally require customers to be at least 15 . A few , however , permit even younger folks to charge purchases . Accounts for teen-agers usually limit credit to a maximum of $50 , though a handful of stores allow young customers to run charges up to as much as $100 . The bulk of stores require parents to approve charge accounts for their offspring , but few require parents to guarantee payment of their children 's bills . Despite critics ' attacks , retailers maintain teen-ager credit plans are proving successful . In most cases , merchants play down the immediate gains in sales , preferring to stress the plans ' " educational " and good will values . Stores report few delinquencies among teenagers ' accounts . Most young charge customers " are very conscientious about doing right , " says J. L. Turner , credit manager of J. P. Ivey &; Co. , a Charlotte , N.C. , department store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and girls over 15 . Though he concedes on occasion a youngster has gone " wild , " evaded the charge limit and piled up as much as $150 in hills , Mr. Turner indicates his general satisfaction with the plan by noting he intends to expand its coverage this fall , probably by paying high school and college students 25 and 50 cents for each new account they sign up . A 17-year-old Ivey customer , blue-eyed Marsha Ezell , agrees the system has worked " wonderfully . " Marsha , who was prompted to open an account last year when she lacked cash for a brown cashmere sweater and a matching skirt set which had caught her fancy says she likes being able to buy things " right quick " when she wants them . And , she adds , having a charge account has taught her how to manage her part-time job money . A few stores go after junior high school students as young as 12 or 13 . For example , Dunaway 's , a Kilmarnock , Va. , apparel store , offers credit to 12-year-olds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and insists $1 must be paid each week . The idea , explains owner Howard E. Dunaway , is to increase traffic by having children troop in once a week to pay their bills .
