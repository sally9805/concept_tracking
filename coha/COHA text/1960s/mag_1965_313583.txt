PRO FOOTBALL <P> Some people collect rare stamps or coins . Ian Fleming 's Goldfinger preferred bullion bars at $14,000 per . But nobody tops Sonny Werblin , president of the American Football League 's New York Jets . Werblin collects quarterbacks . He had three last season , and they cost him $48,000 . Now he has six . He picked up Virginia Tech 's Bob Schweickert for a song , but he had to shell out $200,000 for Notre Dame 's Heisman Trophy winner , John Huarte . And to land Alabama 's Joe Namath , he went all the way to $400,000-the highest price ever paid for a rookie in the history of pro football . <P> Pink ? No , Green . Exclusive of benefits , of course . Like the retirement plan that guarantees Namath $5,000 a year for life after his playing career ends-if it ever begins . Namath has a bad knee ; he reinjured it practicing for the Orange Bowl , and it will take an operation to correct it . Werblin is springing for that too . And just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bank , Sonny threw in a Lincoln Continental . Reporters naturally inquired about the color . " Pink ? " they asked . Uh , uh . " Jet green , " said Namath smartly , and went charging on down to Mobile for the Senior Bowl game . He was slightly less than sensational-passing for one TD but three interceptions as the North and South played to a 7-7 tie . <P> The way the pros are throwing the loot around this year , Santa Claus will have to fight to keep his franchise . " There are n't 40 players in college ball worth fighting over , " insisted one pro scout , but Florida State End Fred Biletnikoff pried enough ( $150,000 ) out of the Oakland Raiders to rent his school 's football stadium to get married in . Sometimes the green left grass stains . Georgia Tackle Jim Wilson signed an $8,000 contract with the A.F.L. 's Boston Patriots last August , another for $75,000 with the N.F.L. 's San Francisco 49ers last month . In between he some how forgot to tell his coach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of college ball . <P> Rebels in the Ranks . Then there were the four Oklahoma players who signed pro contracts before the Jan. 2 Gator Bowl game . That made them ineligible for the game ; Coach Gomer Jones cut them from the squad , and the Sooners got clobbered 36-19 . " I was always nice to the pros , " said Jones , " but I assure you that those guys will never get on my practice field again . " <P> The pro bosses laughed that one off . <P> After all , Oklahoma 's own reputation is not exactly lily-white : Oklahoma was twice put on probation by the N.C.A.A. for maintaining a " slush fund " for athletes . But there were hints of a rebellion brewing in the ranks . San Francisco 's John Brodie insisted that " any regular is silly if he does n't demand more than some rookie behind him is getting . " Quarterback Frank Ryan , who led the Cleveland Browns to the N.F.L. title , was already bucking for a raise-of " about $980,000 . " Said Ryan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his cleats in pro ball is worth $400,000 , then I must be worth a million . "
