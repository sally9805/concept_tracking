txt Roy M. Cohn reported yesterday that he was being investigated by the Internal Revenue Service . The ' New York lawyer said the tax-collecting agency was using information gained in a 1963 watch on his mail to ! carry out the investigation . Senator Edward V. Long , ' chairman of the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on Administrative Practices and Procedures , vdto had been notified by Mr. Cohn of the investigation , said that he had ordered his staff to look into it . Senator Long , Democrat of Missouri , said that if Mr. Cohn 's accusations were borne out , " it will prove what I have charged the I.R.S. with ? an abuse of raw naked power . " " This is the type of harassment people have been complaining about to our committee , " he added . The mail watch , which was ordered in 1963 by Federal tax agents , was ended after a . Federal Court hearing , and subsequently , Mr. Long 's committee conducted hearings . Senator Long , reached by telephone at his country home in Pike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearings as soon as his Staff completed its investigation . John O'Hara , regional coordinator of intelligence activi- , ties for the tax agency , con- ! firmed that Mr. Cohn was under investigation . " But he refused to discuss the case or to // say whether tax forms had been sent to persons on the list gathered during the mail watch . United States Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau said it was the practice of his office not to discuss any matter under investigation . Mr. Cohn said that many per . sons who had received the Federal tax forms had only corresponded with him during the mail watch , and that at least 60 had written him concernina matters other than legal business . These included his rabbi , . some persons interested in charity work and a Fifth Avenue department store . Under law , an investigative Federal agency may request the Post Office to intercept mail and to keep a record of mail received and sent by the person under investigation . This practice has been assailed by President Johnson , Senator Long and others . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bacon &; Bolan , has frequently been in the public eye since he was chief aide to the late Senator Joseph R. McCarthy , who conducted a hunt - for Communists in Government more than a decade ago . " One indignant call was from a lawyer with whom I never got along very well , " Mr. Cohn said . " We 've had our differences of opinion in the co ) lrtroom but I never heard a man so incensed after he had received the form . He wrote me one letter and that was during the mail interception . It concerned a case we were interested in . " In 1962 he was indicted on charges of conspiring to obtruct justice during an investigation of the united Dye &; Chemical Corporation stock fraud case . A jury acquitted him . Law Firm Also Checked The interception of his mail came to light just before his trial . During a hearing-before the late Federal Judge Archie 0 . Dawson , tax agents testified that they had requested the Post Office Department to screen the mail of Mr. Cohn and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In a covering letter dated last Friday asking the recipient o fill out an enclosed form , James J. Corcoran , special Federal tax agent who was in charge of the 1963 Cohn mail watch , wrote : " In connection with an official investigation of the above named attorney it is necessary to obtain detailed information pertaining to fees and disbursements made to him or the law firm of Saxe , Bacon . O'Shea and Saxe , Bacon &; Bolan by you during the years 1959 to 1964 . " In addition to asking for financial data , the form asked who had recommended the recipient to Mr. Cohn or his firm and whether he knew of other clients . Mr. Cohn said in a telephone interview that he was bewildered and concerned . He said his first reaction was that " this must be some kind of a mistake or a joke because I could not conceive of even Internal ? Revenue asking why clients had come to me and asking people to list all clients of my firm . " Mr. Cohn said he felt the tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed out that clients would leave any lawyer quickly rather than get involved with the tax agency . One of those who received the tax form was the Rev. Dr. David 3 . Seligson , senior rabbi of the Central Synagogue , Lexington Avenue and 55th Street . Mr. Cohn said that he had often conversed with Dr. Seligson by telephone , but that the only letter he had received from the rabbi was written Oot. 16 , 1963 . It was an appeal for a contribution . Mr. Cohn said his office had been deluged with telephone calls from " indignant " persons who had received the forms .
