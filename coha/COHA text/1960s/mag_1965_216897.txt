Commander Scott Carpenter is a man of extremes . He has orbited the earth three times as an astronaut , and last week he returned from living a record 30 days beneath the sea as an aquanaut . After surfacing from the Navy 's Sealab II off the coast of Southern California , the versatile Carpenter made the inevitable comparison . " The sea " he said , " is a more hostile environment than space . " He could also proudly report that the men of Sealab II stood up surprisingly well under the unusual stresses of the deep ; they proved that man can live and work in safety as he seeks out the sea 's riches . <P> The aquanauts ' first steps into the inky black 205 ft. down were terrifying . They found that they could get lost only 20 ft. from the capsule . At 50 F. , the water felt breathtakingly cold despite their special rubber suits . Gradually , Sealab crews grew more confident ; they were soon taking only 30 minutes to perform tasks that had taken them three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Aul . " Now as a third and final team finishes the 45-day exercise in underwater living , the aquanauts are busy with the last of 47 scheduled experiments . They are setting up mining equipment and collecting biological samples , examining the gas in fish bladders , and squirting clam juice into the water to see what species of marine life it attracts . As one of their most spectacular tasks , they are trying to salvage a submerged fighter plane by filling it with polyurethane foam and floating it to the surface . <P> The problems of living beneath the sea were varied and puzzling . All the men suffered frequent headaches , occasional absentmindedness , and the strange experience of waking at night perspiring even while feeling bone-chilling cold . Often they noticed a cloudy inability to reason quickly that became known as " the Sealab effect . " In the helium-filled atmosphere of the capsule , sounds took some weird twists , and it was often hard to tell which direction a voice was coming from . Consonants got lost in the thin air . Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Every time someone opened his mouth , " said Carpenter , " the rest of us were in hysterics . " <P> Families in the Future . As a result of their experience , the aquanauts brought back recommendations for changes in future Sealab equipment . They found that the staging area , a 4-ft. by 6-ft. section where the divers change their suits , was too small . The ladder was not designed with flipper-feet in mind . And the refrigerator was too small . Otherwise , the aquanauts are ready and anxious to return to the depths . " It 's in the state of the art now to build an underwater home for a family , " says Carpenter . And the Carpenter family , he allows , would n't mind moving in for a while .
