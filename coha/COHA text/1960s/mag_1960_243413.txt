Antarctica may be a frozen , windswept wasteland , but last week it became the first piece of territory which the U.S. and Russia agreed to make a military and nuclear no man 's land . <P> <P> Not much in the public eye until Admiral Richard E. Byrd 's expeditions in the 1930s , Antarctica soon aroused that old flag-planting urge among several nations . The 1957-58 International Geophysical Year brought a temporary thaw in Antarctic rivalries . Scientists from twelve na tions-the U.S. , Russia , Britain , France , Belgium , Norway , Japan , Australia , New Zealand , South Africa , Argentina , Chile-worked together in a broad and coordinated program of Antarctic research . In May 1958 , President Eisenhower invited them all to Washington to discuss a continuing joint policy for Antarctica . This , he argued , " could have the additional advantage of preventing unnecessary and undesirable political rivalries in that continent , the uneconomic expenditure of funds to defend individual national inter ests , and the recurrent possibility of international misunderstanding . ' ' After an amicable seven-week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and last week the U.S. Senate ratified it . <P> <P> " Dismal Conclusion ? " Recognizing that " it is in the interest of all mankind that Antarctica shall continue forever to be used exclusively for peaceful purposes and shall not become the scene or object of international discord , " the 34-year treaty forbids any military use of Antarctica or any nuclear explosions there . To make sure no nation cheats , each signatory has the right of unlimited inspection . Each nation may establish bases for research or exploration wherever it pleases in Antarctica , but it must suspend its territorial claims for the duration of the treaty . In the meantime , no other claims will be recognized . The nations agree to pool their facilities for the research that has continued in Antarctica ever since IGY : scientists at 33 stations study geology , weather , plant and animal life , and problems of human living under conditions of extreme cold . <P> <P> Though the treaty was the U.S. 's idea , the Senate ratified it only after a prickly debate , and even then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a two-thirds majority with only eight votes to spare . Some Senators grumbled that the U.S. should not have allowed Russia , an Ivan-come-lately with no valid claim in Antarctica , to be a partner in the treaty . " It amounts to putting the free world and the slave world on the same footing , " complained Connecticut 's Thomas Dodd . Thundered Georgia 's Richard Russell , recalling the exploits of the late Explorer Byrd ( brother of Virginia 's Senator Harry F. Byrd ) : " This treaty would certainly be a dismal conclusion to one of the brightest and proudest chapters of American history . " <P> Zone of Peace . Despite such rumblings , the U.S. gave up very little . The U.S. has never formally claimed any part of Antarctica , nor has it formally recognized any other nation 's claim . The treaty presumably removes Antarctica from the cold war , creates a zone of peace in the world . Pleased with Russia 's cooperation in drafting the treaty , the State Department hopes to set a precedent for inspected arms control in less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well .
