 | A burglary is committed somewhere in America every twenty-three seconds . These are some important steps you should take now to protect yourself against housebreakers They struck the palatial home about two o'clock in the morning . Nobody had heard them enter . Suddenly the family ? husband , wife , young son ? was awakened and herded together in the master bedroom . The maids were brought in from their rooms . " Where 's your jewelry ? " one of the robbers demanded of the homeowner . The three men wore red-knit face masks and brown gloves . They carried pencilsize flashlights . At no time did they turn on any of the lights in the house . They knew there was a safe in the basement , and they wanted the combination . The father of the family said that he did n't have it ? that his son , away at college , had it . The burglars beat and kicked him and broke two of his ribs . Still the man stuck to his story . Enraged , the bandits stripped and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the room by her hair , then was burned with lighted cigarettes . So were the German-born maids . The bandits threatened to rape the women in front of the eleven-yearold boy and to turn on the kitchen 's gas jets and blow up the house . Still the man insisted that he did n't have the combination . The torture went on for two and a half hours . Twice a squad car from a private patrol service passed the house . The lights were out , so the security guards saw nothing unusual to investigate . Finally the bandits left . They 'd already stayed long beyond their planned rendezvous with a getaway car . They took with them whatever they could find outside the safe ? $7,635 in jewelry and cash . A " small score , " as they would view it . It sounds like something out of Mickey Spillane . It is n't . Housebreaking is the most common ? and frequently the most brutal ? crime in America . Intruders have filled the annals of crime with the bizarre murders they 've committed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Kansas ; Valerie Percy of Kenilworth , Illinois ; the seven nurses who were bound , gagged and killed in their apartment on Chicago 's South Side . These murders signal not only an increasing appetite for violence on the part of thieves but also a change in their motives and techniques . Until recently , the motive for housebreaking was pretty much burglary : there is still a burglary taking place somewhere in the United States every twentythree seconds . But increasingly , burglary attempts have come to include the abuse , sometimes the torture and even the murder of the occupants of the home : in one recent two-and-one-half-month period , I read about a dozen such cases ? all of them short of murder ? reported in Illinois alone . The victims were not all visibly rich . Some of them lived in quiet neighborhoods in middle-class homes ( although in some of these cases , the felons apparently knew the householders had a hoard of cash on hand ) . Even the underprivileged are being hit hard : just this spring , bars were installed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Robert Taylor Homes in Chicago ? in an effort to cut down on the number of burglaries and assaults being inflicted on the tenants . In sifting through the various methods and types of housebreaking , it becomes clear that one or both of two factors are common to almost every case : ( 1 ) the intruders were attracted by an unusual display or discussion of wealth ? even hidden wealth ; ( 2 ) the intruders found it absurdly easy to get into the home . Take the series of intrusions that struck the North Side and North Shore of Chicago a few years ago . As many as thirteen people were involved in the gang and their techniques varied . Sometimes the crime was only burglary . Sometimes it involved torture . Sometimes both . On one occasion , the bandits entered a home , looked it over carefully ( " beautiful ? the basement is all fixed up " ) and left without taking anything but a firm notion of the opportunities and dangers ( " the son 's got his own phone in his bedroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awakened the family , slugged the man of the  | house with their guns , threatened to torture his wife and children , and made off with $5,000 in valuables . In every case , the intruders entered with utmost ease : they had keys to the doors . This , it turned out , was due to something the women victims had in common ? something so subtle it long escaped the notice of the police : their cars had been parked by the same man when they went to the hairdresser . The ladies would drive to the beauty parlor , in a congested area of Chicago 's swank North Side , get out and leave the keys in the car so that the " car-hiker "  - -  a self-appointed attendant who performs the service for busy shoppers ? could drive it away and find a parking place . After doing so he 'd take the keys ? all the keys ? and have them duplicated . He had plenty of time : a visit to the beauty parlor can take two or three hours . So he not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her home ; if he did n't know her name or address , he had a license number which could be checked against a published list of owners . He also had a partner on the inside : a leading member of the gang ? the one who most enjoyed torturing women ? was a hairdresser . His job gave him access to important information about the women : as they chatted he learned how many furs and jewels they had , and when they were going to be away on vacation . So the men combined their resources ? the information and the keys to the homes ? and formed a gang that terrorized Chicago homeowners for months . The pattern is clear not only in Chicago but also in certain other swank areas ? such as Miami Beach : jewel theft has become the specialty of burglars who like to encounter , and occasionally to frighten or abuse , their victims . Gone are the days when jewel theft was pretty much confined to forays into empty homes by professional burglars . These hope never to be confronted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " one burglary detective told me . " He 'll do anything to keep from being seen . " They sometimes labor strenuously to make certain that a home is unoccupied . One burglar was so anxious to get a stay-at-home Manhattan couple out of their apartment that he sent them , anonymously , tickets to a hit musical . When they left for a wonderful night at the theater , precisely on his schedule , he arrived for a leisurely night of thievery . On another occasion , a burglar unexpectedly found a victim at home and in her bed . He became so flustered that he blurted , " If you make a move , lady , I 'll scream . " She did n't and he did n't . He merely fled . Traditionally , the professional burglar ? unlike many other kinds of criminals ? has liked to think that he 's making his living with his mind , not his muscle . He is constantly seeking new techniques . " It finally dawned on me that they 're watching Mission : Impossible on TV for tips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safes , " a burglary-detail policeman told me , " and that means I have to watch it , too . " The burglar is also constantly on the watch for victims . He does not select them at random . He 's after the " big score " because he knows that if caught -- laws being what they are ? he 'll spend about as much time in prison for a $100 burglary as for a $100,000 one . So he watches the fashion and society pages of various periodicals as well as TV guest-shows to find out who 's wearing what and where . Burglars also exchange a great deal of information among themselves . In the Midwest , the thieves are so well organized that they occasionally circulate a list of automobile license numbers of jewelry salesmen traveling with the best and most coveted samples . Today , however , the old-time " elegant " thief is gradually disappearing . Housebreaking and burglary now involve thugs from almost every level of society . Among them are people who do n't have enough money or who think they do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and young people from a cross section of society who are supporting a narcotics habit . Such a habit can cost $10 , $50 , $100 or more a day . These elements have given birth to a new and more dangerous breed of home-intruder who is regarded by police as less a professional than an opportunist . As it happens , there have been such dramatic changes in the mode of American life that the " opportunists " are given endless opportunity . The flowering of the high-speed expressway , for example , has given them a great deal of mobility . " We find a lot of ' opportunists ' working near the expressways , " says a Chicago police detective , " so they can be back on it and be twenty miles away before anybody even discovers there 's been a burglary . " A " changing neighborhood " is another frequent target if only because the older inhabitants ? genuinely trusting the neighbors they 've been among for decades ? never bothered to mount good locks on their doors or windows , or to get into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's like turning a kid loose in an ice-cream shop , " says one burglary detective in a changing neighborhood . Perhaps the most popular new targets for the " opportunists " are the high-rise apartment buildings springing up all over urban America . Not only do they concentrate a great many potential " marks " in a small area ? a vital factor to an " opportunist " ? but they also are filled with a " new breed " of tenant , the kind who is away at work all day , leaving the apartment unoccupied . " It used to be the wife was home during the day and that made it tougher for the burglar , " says a California police officer . " But now sometimes whole apartment buildings will be deserted from nine o'clock in the morning until after five o'clock in the afternoon . " Thus burglary ? once a nighttime crime ? has become largely a daytime activity . Many burglars work the nine-to-five shift , wandering the corridors of nearempty high-rises all day , looking for easy " scores . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try each knob in the hope of finding an open door . Some of them are " punch-andgrab " men ; they use a pipe wrench or pliers or sometimes even their bare hands to twist off the doorknobs and break the locks on the doors . Some of them are " loid " men : they slip a piece of celluloid down the crack between the door and the jamb and work it against the tongue of the lock in an effort to force it open . More forward-looking burglars go to the site of a new high-rise while the building is under construction and steal a few locks before they 've been mounted on the doors ? the " samples " will allow the burglar to develop a master key . Then , after the burglar has his loot , all he has to do is walk out with it . To keep costs down , individual elevator operators have been replaced by automatic systems in many cases . The burglar merely gets into such an elevator and descends to the basement where there is usually an exit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that the burglar can drive right in , then leave with his load of loot . " We 've known them to strip an entire apartment , " one burglary detective told me . Why ca n't the police do something about all this ? Because they only know where an intruder 's been , not where he 's going to be . " That 's what makes you sweat on burglary ? you 're dealing with a phantom , " says a Chicago detective . Sometimes the victims themselves ? for reasons beyond comprehension ? destroy even the tiniest hopes for clues . Last summer , a seventy-two-year-old woman , who lived alone in an expensive hotel-apartment building on Chicago 's Gold Coast , was bound and gagged by intruders who made off with $51,000 in valuables . Burglary detectives could n't find a fingerprint or , in fact , much evidence that anything was out of place . " Oh , " the charming lady said finally , " I took about forty-five minutes and tidied things up before I called the police . I would n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " ( " My own mother , " groaned one cop , " would probably have done the same thing ! " ) On a few occasions , an intruder becomes the victim of his own success and police do have a chance to catch him in the act . Earlier this year , for instance , there was an outbreak of thirty burglaries in a middle-class neighborhood on Chicago 's northwest side . The victims had one thing in common : they were all out at the wake or funeral of a loved one when the intruders entered their empty homes . ( The way the burglar thinks is this : At a funeral , the folks leave all the " flash " ?  | the jewels and furs ? at home . At a wedding , they take the " flash " with them ? but they leave the wedding gifts at home . ) Funerals or memorial services for young men killed in Vietnam have increased this type of intruder 's attention . " When it 's that kind of wake or funeral , " says a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honor the boy . So the burglar knows it 's not just one house that 's empty but probably the whole block . " Such a case of " too much success , " permitting the police to anticipate burglars ' movements , occurred in midFebruary , when the body of Lance Corporal James McCann , who had died on a hospital ship after being wounded in Vietnam , was returned for burial in Chicago . His family was related by marriage to Joseph Ahrens , a Chicago police officer , who asked permission to stay in the darkened house , with another police officer , while the family was at the wake . The pattern of the " death notice " burglaries made him think the intruder might try the McCann residence . Sure enough , while the family was at the wake , the phone in the McCann residence rang . The police officers did n't answer it . ( Phoning ahead of time , to make sure the residence is empty , is a common tactic of burglars . ) About ten minutes later , a man in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he walked around to the back where he was joined by another man . The other police officer snapped his fingers twice to signal to Ahrens that there were now two men outside the house . The intruders broke the glass in a rear door , turned the key in the lock , and walked in . From the shadows , Officer Ahrens suddenly called out , " We 're police officers ! Throw up your hands ! " One of the intruders cursed and screamed , " Shoot him ! Shoot him ! " Ahrens saw a violent movement in the dark and fired one shot . It hit one of the burglars in the head and killed him instantly . The other fled out the door and got away in the darkness . On the dead man 's body , police found a long list of addresses taken from death notices . The McCann address topped the list . That these burglars were ready to shoot it out with the police reflects the increasing trend toward violence on the part of housebreakers . Added to this is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even seek out , face-to-face encounters with their victims ? the factor that has greatly increased the danger to the victims . To be sure , most intruders do not set out , deliberately , to murder a home 's occupants , even though they might plan to abuse or torture them . But there is a very great danger that they will become hysterical in the excitement or fear generated by the crime and that this will lead to murder . There is no pattern or predictability in this ; the " junkie " burglar ? the dope addict seeking only to be a sneak thief ? may turn out to be even more dangerous than a bandit gang that invades a home and stays for hours . " Usually , when they 're under the influence of drugs , they tend to be nonviolent ? they have no feeling for violence , " one police officer told me . " But if they 're not on it at the moment ? and if faced with the possibility of being cut off from their next fix ? there 's no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private citizen do about the frightening problem of home-inva-sion ? If an intruder really wants to get into a home ? any home ? he can do it . Almost nothing can keep him out . In Chicago , a woman who 'd been burglarized twice put three " sure-security " locks on her door . She came home early from a New Year 's Eve party and found that she 'd surprised burglars working to get into her apartment . They 'd started taking the door off its hinges . In Manhattan , an oft-burgled couple mounted a complex system of eight locks on their apartment door . One night they came home and found their apartment had been entered and looted of some $1,300 in valuables . The determined thieves had picked the eight locks . On a remote estate near Plano , Illinois , a bandit gang decided not to waste time on subtleties . When they found they could n't get into the house through any of the customary routes , they sim-  | ply picked up a redwood table from a patio and rammed it through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass , rounded up an heiress and her maid , bound and gagged them , and escaped with $40,000 in valuables . However , there are certain steps that everyone can take to discourage an intruder . These fall into two broad categories . One is to eliminate his incentive . Do n't give him a motive for robbing you . Do n't display the " flash . " Do n't gossip or brag about all the furs and jewels you own . Do n't talk about all the cash you and your husband have saved and how much you hate banks . Most of all , do n't suggest that the greatest problem you face in life is where to hide your valuables ? and how cleverly you solved the problem . One opera star who 'd been burglarized twice mentioned publicly that she now stores her jewels in the refrigerator , carefully wrapped in silver foil or waxed paper . What she does n't realize is that most practiced burglars look into refrigerators and freezers ? and particularly into ice-cube trays ? pretty much as a matter of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stored in and recovered from an ice cube ? and burglars know it . An important corollary to this is always to make your apartment or home look occupied . This might discourage the " opportunist " intruder . To the classic advice ? do n't let the mail and milk pile up , keep the lights on at night ? there are now added some technical aids that help create the impression that a home is occupied . The most useful are timers that turn wall-plug lights and appliances on and off when you choose , no matter how long you 're away . One Chicago police lieutenant has a timer that switches out the light in his family room , while another timer then promptly switches on the lights in his bedroom until two or three o'clock in the morning . That , he says , will discourage the " opportunist " no matter how long the police officer himself is away . In a Manhattan high-rise , a bachelor recorded the sounds of a cocktail party ? giggling girls , clinking glasses , much noise , loud music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tape recorder when he 's out at night . The timer simply switches it on about eight o'clock at night and lets it play for four hours or more on a thin-wound tape , thus thoroughly discouraging any intruder who approaches the apartment . A less elaborate procedure , especially in apartments , is simply to leave a radio or TV set on with the sound volume turned up . The second way to deal with potential intruders is to make it as difficult and frightening for them to get in , and to stay in , as possible . There are two ways to do this ? through a good lock system and through a good alarm system . In both cases , you have to be realistic . If you have a good lock system , your door can still be jimmied . Or taken off its hinges . Or a window can be broken . But you can reduce the odds by seeking out the best locks possible . The easiest lock to get past is the " snap " lock used on vast numbers of house and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incline on one side ; it " snaps " into place when the door is closed . A skilled " loid " man can open a snap lock in a second or two , even faster than a resident using a key . For an additional $1.50 or $2 per door , you can get a much safer lock , one with a " dead bolt " feature . The most familiar dead-bolt lock has a square-edged rectangular tongue that fits snugly into a rectangular opening in the doorjamb ; it is the kind of tongue you usually see on systems that can be " double-locked . " Another type of dead-bolt lock has a mechanism whose movement is vertical ; the cylindrical locking " pins " move up and down through hasps on the doorjamb . The " cosmetic " value of this lock is low but its efficiency is high . The lock can not be " loided " ; the door is difficult to jimmy . Any dead-bolt lock can be picked , but this is a timeconsuming operation . And intruders  | become quite tense when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few years , there have been many attempts to design more formidable home locks . They range from combination locks that ca n't be picked ( because they have no keyhole ) , to a lock that uses a steel bar to brace the door shut and that ca n't be forced ( because it has no tongue ) , to a lock-and-key system that uses almost three-score " dimples " on three sides of a key 's shaft ( it is considered fifty times as complicated as the more familiar lock-andkey system using ridges and valleys on one surface of a key ) . Though all such systems have their drawbacks ( if you ca n't remember numbers , then you 'd do better with a key lock than a combination lock ) one step can be taken to contribute immensely to the safety of almost any lock system : make sure it must be operated by the same key on the inside as well as the outside . Then , if an intruder ca n't get past the outside lock and breaks a window to reach in and open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way barred by the inside lock ? which ca n't be picked ? and not by an easy-to-open door latch . One warning : in this case , all occupants of the house must have their key handy so they can open the inside lock and get out if there 's a fire or other emergency . As far as alarms are concerned , there is no limit to the imagination of spaceage devices . You can get alarm systems that work on sonics , radar , photoelectric cells and radio waves . You can get alarm systems that detect sound , motion , or the slightest vibration of a doorknob , drawer , or jewel box . You can get alarm systems that will suddenly turn on every light in the house , or will shriek a warning to the neighborhood , or send a quiet signal for help to the local police station . You can get alarm systems that will not only frighten off an intruder but also may scare him half to death . You can get an alarm that costs anywhere from $10 up to many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system has its limitations . Some intruders know how to use wires to nullify certain kinds of systems ; others use CO2 , the foam from a modern fire extinguisher , to spray and , thereby , smother a control box , horn-alarm or siren . Still other alarm systems can be set off accidentally by children going to the bathroom at night , or by pets prowling through the house , or even by the motion of a curtain moving in the breeze . But you can get an alarm system suitable to your own needs ? and you can be assured that the people who have the most to protect are most likely to use an alarm system . In Lake Forest , Illinois , a small though well-to-do community north of Chicago , at least sixty-nine homes use alarm systems that automatically notify police or security forces by phone lines whenever an intruder approaches . How useful is a dog in discouraging intruders ? Very useful in driving off the " opportunist " intruder , particularly if you can keep the dog mean enough . But that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doberman pinscher ? considered the best type of guard dog ? admits that he has n't been able to keep up the discipline of having only two people , himself and his wife , feed the dog ( on the theory that the dog will attack anybody else who tries to feed him ) . " We 've got too many kids and friends who give him affection and food , " says the detective . Still , he is sure that this dog will frighten off an " opportunist " who happens to approach his home . But a more professional intruder ? or a housebreaking gang ? will find a way to get around the dog . One way is to smear the arms and legs of the intruder with beef bones ? anything that will leave the smell of meat ? in the conviction that the odor will win a friendly approach from the dog . Then the intruder will feed him poisoned meat . Perhaps the most helpful protection against a thief 's invasion of your home is an alert neighbor-friend . " They 're the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savvy police officer . " We gave our neighbors a key to the house so they can come in and help us if something goes wrong when we 're home . Or so they can come in and take a look around ? maybe change the timers ? when we 're gone on vacation . " What are police departments doing to keep pace with the changes in housebreaking techniques and the rise in violence ? There is , in fact , a good deal of thought and energy going into the " new technology " of police work . In Lakewood , California , a community of some 87,000 people near Los Angeles , the sheriff 's police have been using helicopters in a special patrol operation since May 24 , 1966 . In " hush helicopters " ? with special equipment to muffle the sound ? these " sky knights " travel at speeds of sixty to eighty-five mph and are able to patrol , in one helicopter , as much area as fifteen squad cars . Moreover , a new alarm system was developed to aid the heli-cops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are 26,000 candle-power hooded reflector lights that turn at thirty revolutions per minute . They can not be seen from ground level by burglars but they can be seen from the air as far away as five miles in daylight and twelve miles at night . In a matter of seconds the helicops can swoop down to help catch the criminal and save the property of his victim , and , perhaps , his life . " Many people would be dead if it were n't for our helicopters , " says Sheriff Peter J. Pitchess . The statistical success of the system is indisputable : after the first year , burglaries were down ten percent in Lakewood ? though they were up six percent in California as a whole . One result of Lakewood 's success is that in March , 1968 , Kansas City moved to install the same system of air patrol . Another system , called Electronic Police Surveillance , was proposed for Newport Beach , California , a research-and-resort community near Los Angeles . The city 's population of 40,000 surges to close to 200,000 on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area 's almost six and a half miles of public beaches and a fine harbor . These attract the added thousands ? some of whom prey upon and abuse the permanent residents . To handle the situation , Police Chief B. J. Glavas felt it was time " to put more faith in the deterrent effect of technology . " He wanted to apply a proposed Federal grant toward the installation of " EPS , " a closed-circuit television system using long-range " zoom " lenses on TV cameras scattered at key points around town . Immediately , there was an objection that this would constitute an invasion of privacy . Chief Glavas growled , " The public streets are not for privacy . " His opponents thought it likely that police-TV would not only scan downtown streets but would also go into residential neighborhoods , peering through picture windows into the living rooms , and possibly the bedrooms , to observe ? and perhaps videotape ? everything that went on there . Certainly , it seemed that this was the only way the police would know if intruders were entering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to be under more intense surveillance than the criminals . The project was shelved last spring when it became apparent that the Federal money might not be quickly forthcoming . But the proposal reflects one community 's attempt ? and perhaps a future plan ? for police in this field . These efforts are , to be sure , aimed at catching the intruder in the act . From the private citizen 's point of view , it is better to avoid the intrusion completely , if only by using the common qualities of good sense and constant alertness . Good sense includes not tempting an intruder with a gaudy display of wealth . Constant alertness means taking those steps which will make it difficult for an intruder to get in ? or stay in ? the home . In the end , it is these common qualities of the individual that offer the final safeguard against violent housebreakers.
