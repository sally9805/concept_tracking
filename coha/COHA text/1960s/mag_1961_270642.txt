Wherever John Kennedy goes these days , a large , black , looseleaf notebook goes with him . The notebook is the President 's " Berlin Book , " consisting of 20 position papers on all possible phases of the persistent peace-or-war question that Kennedy must eventually answer . In the White House , and last weekend on another brief vacation in Hyannisport . John Kennedy spent hours over his homework . Never before , said his aides , had the President spent so much time and thought contemplating the implications of a single question . " He 's imprisoned by Berlin . " said one Cabinet member . " Ever since his Europe trip , Berlin has occupied him totally . " <P> Toward Action . By last week , John Kennedy 's total occupation was turning toward action . Off to Moscow this week , after last-minute revisions to satisfy NATO allies , will go the U.S. answer to Khrushchev 's last-month memorandum on Berlin . The State Department will release a White Paper on Berlin to further justify the Western stand . The President this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. plans ( his top aides have already visited Gettysburg to inform Dwight Eisenhower ) , issue a statement on Berlin at his midweek press conference , hold a planning session of the National Security Council . <P> Basically , the Administration 's attitude is : " Go slow-and watch out for the unexpected . " For the President well understands that the Communist challenge is worldwide , and that crisis is not limited to Berlin . South Viet Nam is threatened by a new Communist guerrilla buildup in bordering Laos . There is potential trouble ahead at the U.N. , where the question of Red China 's entrance is sure to be raised at the General Assembly this fall . For years the issue has been kept from resolution by an annual vote in favor of a moratorium on discussion of whether the mainland Communists or the Nationalists on Formosa represent the people of China . Each year the moratorium draws fewer votes , and U.N . Ambassador Adlai Stevenson and Secretary of State Dean Rusk have helped make the situation less hopeful than usual by announcing that this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As he armed himself for a long season of crisis , John Kennedy had notably changed from the zesty Bostonian who took the oath of office last January . From the start , Kennedy knew well that his job , carrying with it sole responsibility for decisions of imponderable magnitude , had forced every President before him into an unwanted , unique loneliness . Yet it was still a surprise that he had retreated into the isolation of power so early . A gregarious man with uncommon social charm , Kennedy has become steadily less and less available to old college and political pals . Once the most accessible President the Washington press corps had ever known , he is now acutely sensitive to criticism . His vivid Irish wit flashes infrequently . One White House staffer who sees him daily says that even in the midst of briefings the President sometimes ceases to listen as he stares into space-apparently searching for the answer to some nagging problem . <P> Obviously , it was still too early to assess the effect of the President 's inevitable isolation . Yet there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was recovering the confidence that had been temporarily shattered by the Cuban disaster .
