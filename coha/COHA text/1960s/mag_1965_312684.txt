Almost every Republican has some sort of explanation for the party 's 1964 disaster and some sort of remedy for the future . Among the more provocative commentators is former G.O.P. National Chairman Leonard Hall of New York , who aired his ideas last week in an article for the Long Island newspaper Newsday . Excerpts : <P> We have permitted our party to become too exclusive . We have been trying to elect national candidates with the descendants of the people who came over on the Mayflower , and that boat just was n't big enough . The answers can be found in an analysis of dramatic Republican victories last November , despite the nationwide Democratic tide . In Massachusetts , the home of the Cabots and the Lodges , John Volpe , the son of Italian immigrants , was elected Governor , and Ed Brooke , a descendant of Negro slaves , was overwhelmingly re-elected attorney general ; in California , George Murphy , an Irish-American Catholic , overcame seemingly impossible odds to be elected Senator , and in Hawaii , Hiram Fong , a descendant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Senate by a huge majority , while Democrats were sweeping practically all other offices in his state . <P> Unfortunately , there are far too few Volpes and Brookes and Murphys and Fongs in the Republican ranks , and our party gives the appearance of being an organization of white Anglo-Saxon Protestants . America is a nation of racial , religious and ethnic minorities . Overall , even the white Anglo-Saxon Protestants are a minority . I admit , regretfully , that when you attend any meeting of Republicans on the national scale , the faces you see and the names you hear are rarely Negro , Italian-American , Polish-American , Irish-American , or Jewish , or any of the other groups that combine to make up our country . Look at what happened in 1960 and 1964 : in both of those presidential elections the Republicans lost 75% of the Catholic vote . We lost 80% of the Jewish vote , and we lost from 75% to 96% of the Negro vote . These figures are crucial to the future of the Republican Party . <P> Long &; Short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political campaign we will form a Jewish committee and an Italian-American committee and a Polish-American committee , and so on . Then , when we get into office , what do we do ? <P> A comparison of the Cabinets under Eisenhower , and under Kennedy and Johnson , will show what I mean . When I went to Washington as Republican National Chairman in 1953 , I found that President Eisenhower had told all Cabinet officers that they could bring in their own men as deputies , staff assistants and advisers . When I looked over the list of appointments , I discovered that a great percentage of the jobs in the executive end of government had gone to Michigan and New York . Why ? Well , first , that 's where big business is . And second , the Cabinet , while long on brains , was somewhat short on politics . As a result , the Eisenhower Administration turned out , in the eyes of the public , to be almost exclusively Anglo-Saxon and Protestant , even though Eisenhower himself remained the idol of all elements in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
