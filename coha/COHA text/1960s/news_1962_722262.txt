txt Letters ELLIOTT K. STEINMARTIN A. LIVENSTEIN , R. E. DIAMOND.JACOB E. LIPPMAN.BETH BERG ... Letters OF TWO REBELLIONS To THE EDITOR : Richard B. Morris says that the French Revolution became a military dictatorship largely because it produced no leader of the stature of George Washington , prepared to renounce power when the major goals were reached ( " The French Revolution Is Still an Issue , " Jan , 28 ) . We might add to this that the French Revolution also produced no leader of the caliber of Thomas Jefferson , James Madison , or Benjamin Franklin , or Alexander Hamilton , or John Adams , etc. , etc . Perhaps the reason for this is that the leaders of the American Revolution grew up and were educated in the Anglo-Saxon tradition of law , constitutionality , meaningful parliamentary forms , and the concept of the taxing power residing in the elected representatives of the people . These Americans understood the principles of representative government and had considerable autonomy here even befor the revolution . In France , however , the revolution represented ultimately the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolution , while able , had had no experience with representative forms and accordingly made a botch of it . ELLIOTT K. STEIN Bristol , Conn . LINCOLN QUOTE To THE EDITOR : In " A Revolution Intended for All Mankind " ( Dec. 10 ) , Chester Bowles quoted Abraham Lincoln as having said : " The right of revolution is a most sacred right ; a right which we believe is to liberate the world . " Can anyone give the context of this quotation ? It does n't sound like Lincoln . G. WEISS . Glen Head , N. Y. The quotation is from Lincoln , who , in a speech in Congress , Jan. 12 , 1848 , in connection with . the Mexican War , defended the right of people in Mexico , Texas or anywhere else to revolt . The full quotation is : " Any people anywhere , being inclined and having the power , have the right to rise up and shake off the existing government , and form a new one . This is a most valuable , and most sacred right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberate the world . " ? Editor . ' HALFWAY HOUSE ' TO THE EDITOR : Elmer Bendiner 's " ' Immovable Obstacle ' in the Way of a New Bowery " ( Jan. 21 ) demands clarification of a serious , human problem . The human derelicts of the Bowery are more often seen as a problem to be rid of rather than a societal problem worthy of our solution . There are at present two plans available for " Operation Bowery " ? one forwarded by the City of New York , the other by the Lower East Side Chamber of Commerce . Both plans propose a referral unit to disperse the homeless men to rehabilitation centers // Letters // out of the city , to hospitals , to work camps , My telephone conversation with Mr. Bendiner suggested a third idea , that of the " Halfway House . " Halfway House would be a resident , in-city rehabilitation center staffed by trained social workers and vocational instructors . Medical and psychiatric consultation would be available to this staff , preferably in the form of a small out-patient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of men could be treated and hopefully rehabilitated . With this experience gained , a program of wider scope could be tackled . Halfway House could be the beginnings or bridging the gap between our organized , responsible society and the dependent human derelict . Both might gain from such experience . The Halfway House is certainly not a new concept . It has been used successfully in delinquency prevention programs , when adequately staffed and supervised . The Halfway House simply attempts to solve the problem where it exists , with services and skills necessary for such solution . Halfway House is the literal symbol of organized society reaching out to help others where and when such help is needed . MARTIN A. LIVENSTEIN , Executive Director , Lower Eastside Neighborhoods Association . New York . TV MIRACLE To THE EDITOR : To Elaine Kendall 's impressive catalogue of television absurdities in " If Perry Mason Lost a Case ? " ( Jan. 21 ) might well be added another that I have noticed : TV heroes always park their cars directly in front of whatever building they are bound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once that television is hopelessly out of touch with reality . K. E. DIAMOND . Grosse Pointe , Mich . ' NEED RELATIVES ' To THE EDITOR : Miss Kendall 's article about the lack of realism in television heroes makes the point that many of them seem to be orphans , or in any event , lacking any close relatives . Could it be that such images , also present in many motion pictures , contribute to some of our present-day social prob-lems ? What is perfectly reasonable behavior for an orphan without relatives becomes irresponsible behavior when practiced by people who have family ties . Constant presentation of such behavior , apparently reasonable because the protagonists conveniently have no relatives . can warp the standards of personal responsibility of that vast majority of the public which does have relatives . JACOB E. LIPPMAN . Newark , N. J. ' BOOB-TUBE ' To THE EDITOR : It was so refreshing reading Elaine Kendall 's article . For three years I have not had a Boob-tube , and it is not missed at all .

INVASIONS OF RUSSIA To THE EDITOR : In Lord Taylor 's article , " Deep Analysis of the Russian Mind " ( Jan. 7 ) , I read that " The Russians have met invading armies from the West on their own soil fourteen times in the last 150 years . " This seems so many I wonder if he would name these invasions ? THOMAS WEIXII . Yonkers , N. Y. Lord Taylor replies : " My list of the fourteen invasions of Russia follows : ( 1 ) 1812 : Napoleonic invasion ; ( 2 ) 1831 : Polish rebellion ; ( 3 ) 1853 : Crimean War ; ( 4 ) 1863 : second Polish rebellion ; ( 5 ) 1916 : Germany invades Russia following defeat of Russian attack ; ( 6 ) 1918 : following the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk , Germany invades the Ukraine ; ( 7 ) 1918 : Czech prisoners , with the French , seize part of the Volga and Ural regions ; ( 8 ) 1918 : British and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1918 : British occupy Baku ; ( 10 and 11 ) 1918 : Allied supplies to Denikin in the south and Yudenich in the west ; ( 12 ) 1920 : Poland , assisted by France , invades Russia ; ( 13 ) 1920 : Wrangel with Allied help fortifies the Perekop Isthmus ; ( 14 ) 1941 : German invasion . " TWICE-RAISED To THE EDITOR : The analysis of the African approach to democracy , by Elspeth Huxley , " Africa Struggles With Democracy " ( Jan. 21 ) was most interesting and arresting . However , I fear that Homer has nodded again . In the box entitled " New Chief " the . author remarks that Western critics " raise an eyebrow at the magnificent state apartments going up in Conakry for President Houphouet-Boigny at a cost of some $15,000,000 . " Perhaps the author meant they are in Abidjan . ( Rev. ) JAMES H. GRIFFITIIS . New York . /The reader is correct . The apartments have been built in Abidjan. capital of the Ivory Coast , for President Houphouet-Boigny  --  Editor    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
