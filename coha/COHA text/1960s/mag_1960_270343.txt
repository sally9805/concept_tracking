FOR the procession of tourists that begins this time of year to swarm in ever increasing numbers through London 's great British Museum , the famed Elgin Marbles may be the museum 's best-known treasure . But equally magnificent in their way are the bas-reliefs ( see color pages ) from the palace of Assurbanipal , King of Assyria in the 7th century B.C. These shallow tablets recall an empire that once included Egypt on the south and Asia Minor on the north , with all the Fertile Crescent in between . <P> According to the nameless artists whose duty it was to record his glory , Assurbanipal was as fierce as he was fearless . His chief business was war , and no victory seemed quite complete unless his enemies could be slowly tortured to death before his eyes . The days of victory did not last forever . The king 's scribes duly recorded Assurbanipal 's thundering lament : " I did well unto god and man , to dead and living . Why have sickness , ill-health , misery and misfortune befallen me ? <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me down ; with cries of woe I bring my days to an end . " <P> The bas-reliefs shown on the following pages portray the king in happier times . For the Assyrians , the hunt was an art in itself . The king 's men would release a captive lion from a cage so that the king could first wound him with arrows . At last the monarch would step forward , his left arm wrapped in a heavy cloth ( which the artist here omits so as not to disfigure the king ) . As the lion reared for the last time , the king would plunge his weapon through the great beast 's body . <P> Everything lives and moves across the stone , not with the fluid grace of classical Greece , but to the harsher beat of the darker desert world . But to the artists who shaped the limestone , the lions clearly were heroic . They leap to the attack , roar with indignation ; at times they seem to have more humanity than the stiffly muscled and ringleted men who torment them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also the final glory .
