TULAN By C. C. MacAPP To disobey the orders of the Council of Four was unthinkable to a Space Admiral of the old school . But the trouble was , the school system had changed . A man , a fighter , an Admiral had to think for himself now , if his people were to live . While facing the Council of Four his restraint had not slipped ; but afterward , shaking with fury , the Admiral of the Fleets of Sennech slammed halfway down the long flight of stone steps before he realized someone was at his elbow . He slowed . " Forgive me , Jezef . They made me so mad I forgot you were waiting . " Jezef ( adjutant through most of Tulan 's career , and for some years brother-in-law as well ) was shorter and less harshly carved than his superior . " So they would n't listen to you . Not even Grefen ? " " Even Grefen . " That vote had stabbed deepest of all . Jezef took it with the detachment that still irritated Tulan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and we go back under the yoke . Well , they 've always been soft masters . " They reached the ground cars . Before getting into his own Tulan said coldly , " Since you 're so philosophical about it , you 'll be a good one to bear the sight of men saying good-bye to their families . We 're to take full crews to Coar and surrender them with the ships . Requisition what help you need and get everybody aboard by noon tomorrow . " Jezef saluted with a hint of amused irony , and left . * * * * * Whipping through the dark icy streets , Tulan smiled sourly , thinking how Sennech 's scientists had reversed themselves on the theory of hyperspace now that Coar had demonstrated its existence . Maybe the Council was right in mistrusting their current notions . As for himself , he saw only two things to consider : that with Coar swinging behind the sun , the accuracy of her new weapon had gone to pot ; and that before she was clear again he could pound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her flabby fleets and driven the remnants from space , but the Council , faced with the destruction and casualties from just a few days of the weird surprise bombardment , was cowed . He 'd spent the previous night at home , but was n't going back now , having decided to make his farewell by visiphone . It was the thing he dreaded most , or most immediately , so as soon as he reached the flagship he went to his quarters to get it over with . Anatu 's eyes  --  the same eyes as Jezef 's  --  looked at him out of the screen , filling him with the familiar awkward worship . " You 've heard ? " he asked finally . " Yes . You wo n't be home before you go ? " " No ; I ... " He abandoned the lie he 'd prepared . " I just did n't feel up to it . " She accepted that . " I 'll wake the boys . " " No ! It 's  --  " Something happened to his throat . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be back from Coar . You 've got to speak to them . " He nodded . This was n't going according to plan ; he 'd intended it to be brief and controlled . Damn it , he told himself , I 'm Admiral of the Fleets ; I 've no right to feelings like this . He straightened , and knew he looked right when the two sleepy stares occupied the screen . Their hair was stiff and stubborn like his own , so that they wore it cropped in the same military cut . It could have stood a brush right now . They were quiet , knowing enough of what was wrong to be frightened . He spoke carefully . " I 'm going to Coar to talk to them about stopping the war . I want you to look after things while I 'm away . All right ? " " All right , Dad . " The older one was putting on a brave front for the benefit of the younger and his mother , but the tears showed . As Tulan cut the connection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and realized with surprise that he 'd never before , in all the years , seen her cry . He watched the last faint images fade from the screen . * * * * * Sometime near dawn he gave up trying to sleep , dressed , and began composing orders . Presently Jezef came in with cups of steaming amber liquid . They sipped in silence for a while , then Jezef asked " You 've heard about Grefen ? " Tulan felt something knot inside him . He shook his head , dreading what he knew was coming . " He killed himself last night , " Jezef said . Tulan remembered the agony in the old Minister of War 's eyes when he 'd voted for surrender . Grefen had been Admiral in his day ; the prototype of integrity and a swift sledgehammer in a fight ; and Tulan 's first combat had been under him . A symbol of the Fleet , Tulan reflected ; and his death , yes , that too was a symbol  --  what was there but shame in surrender , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand clenched , crumpling the paper it was resting on . He smoothed the paper and re-read the order he 'd been writing . He visualized the proud ranks of his crewmen , reduced to ragged lines shuffling toward prison or execution . It seemed impossible , against the laws of nature , that men should strive mightily and win , then be awarded the loser 's prize . His anger began to return . " I 've a mind to defy the Government and only take skeleton crews , " he said . " Leave the married men , at least . " Jezef shrugged . " They 'd only be bundled into transports and sent after us . " " Yes . Damn it , I wo n't be a party to it ! All they did was carry out their orders , and superbly , at that ! " Jezef watched him with something like curiosity . " You 'd disobey the Council ? You ? " Tulan felt himself flush . " I 've told you before , discipline 's a necessity to me , not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfair ; up to now it really had n't occurred to him that he might disobey . His inward struggle was brief . He grabbed the whole pad of orders and ripped them across . " What 's the Council , with Grefen gone , but three trembling old men ? Get some guns manned , in case they get suspicious and try to interfere . " Blood began to surge faster in his veins ; he felt a vast relief . How could he have ever seen it differently ? He jabbed at a button . " All ships ' Duty Officers ; scramble communication circuits . This is the Admiral . Top Secret Orders .... " * * * * * Shortly before noon the four-hundred-odd ships lifted out of Sennech 's frosty atmosphere , still ignoring the furious demands from the radio . Fully armed , they could n't be stopped . Tulan 's viewer gave a vivid picture of the receding fifth planet . The white mantle of ice and snow was a backdrop for blue artificial lakes and the dark green of forest-strips ( hardy conifers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farms . The ice had been almost unbroken until men came , bringing more heat than Sennech had ever received from a far-off sun . That had been before the First Solar War , when Teyr ( the race of Aum had originated there ) ruled . That awful struggle had bludgeoned the home planet back to savagery , and left Coar and Sennech little better off . With recovery , Coar had taken over and prospered immensely . Teyr stayed wild except for small colonies planted there by the other two planets , and Sennech lagged for a while . Within Tulan 's lifetime his world had found itself ready to rise against the lax but profit-taking rule of Coar , and that rebellion had grown into the present situation . Sennech 's wounds were plainly visible in the viewscreen ; great man-made craters spewing incandescent destruction blindly over farm , city , or virgin ice . The planet was in three-quarters phase from here , and Tulan could see the flecks of fire in the darkness beyond the twilight zone . Near the edge of that darkness he made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where Anatu would be giving two small boys their supper . He checked altitude , found they were free of the atmosphere , and ordered an acceleration that would take them halfway to the sun in fifty hours . It was uncomfortable now , with Sennech 's gravity added , but that would fall off fast . Jezef hauled himself in and dropped to a pad . " I wish I had your build , " he said . " Do you really think we can pull this off ? " Tulan , in a good mood , grinned at him . " Have I ever led you into defeat yet , pessimist ? " " No ; and more than once I 'd have bet ten to one against us . That 's why the Fleet fights so well for you ; we have the feeling we 're following a half-god . Gods , however , achieve defeats as terrible as their victories . " Tulan laughed and sat down beside Jezef with some charts . " I think I 'll appoint you Fleet Poet . Here 's the plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be on our way around the sun to overtake Coar and either fight or surrender , or we might be diving into the sun in a mass suicide . That 's why I broke off the siege and pulled all units away from Coar ; the fact that they 're coming back around to meet us will suggest something like that . " " Are they going to join up ? " " No ; I want them on this side of the sun but behind us . I have a use for them later that depends on their staying hidden . Incidentally , I 'm designating them Group Three . " In a few hours we 're going to turn hard , this side of the sun , and intercept Teyr . I want to evacuate our forces from the moon , then decoy whatever the enemy has there into space where we can get at them . That 's their last fleet capable of a sortie , and with that gone we can combine our whole strength and go around to Coar . She 'll probably give up immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * Jezef thought it over . " Will they be foolish enough to leave the moon ? As long as they 're safely grounded there , they constitute a fleet-in-being and demand attention . " " We 'll give them a reason to move , then ambush them . Right now we 've a lot of reorganizing to do , and I want you to get it started . We 're splitting this Force into Groups One and Two . Here 's what I want . " * * * * * They cut drives and drifted in free fall while supplies were transferred between ships , then Tulan held an inspection and found crews and equipment proudly shipshape . Despite the proliferating rumors , morale was excellent . A few hours later the realignment began . Space was full of the disc-shapes ; thin , delicate-looking Lights with their projecting external gear , and thicker , smoothly armored Mediums and Heavies . He had twenty-three of the latter in Group One , with twice as many Mediums and a swarm of smaller craft . Group Two , composed of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and diverging away . That was a vital part of his plan . From a distance they 'd look to telescope or radar like a full combat fleet . He was almost ready to swerve toward the third planet and its moon , but first he had a speech to make . It was time to squash all the rumors and doubts with a dramatic fighting announcement . He checked his appearance , stepped before the scanner , and nodded to Communications to turn it on . " All hands , " he said , then waited for attention . The small monitor screens showed a motley sampling of intent faces . He permitted himself a tight smile . " You know I have orders to surrender the Fleet . " He paused for effect . " Those are the orders of the Council of Four , and to disobey the Council would be unthinkable . " Yet it is also unthinkable that a single ship of the Fleet should surrender under any circumstances , at any time ; therefore I am faced with a dilemma in which tradition must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and so , perhaps , have many of the people of Sennech . We have ways of knowing that the people of Coar , far more than our own , clamor at their government for any sort of peace . " Coar 's fleets are smashed and the remnants have fled from space . " Clearly , courage has all but vanished from the Solar System ; yet there is one place where courage has not wavered . That place is in the Fleet of Sennech . " At this moment we are the only strength left in the Solar System . We dominate the System ! " Would we have history record that the Fleet won its fight gloriously , then cravenly shrank back from the very brink of victory ? " We left Sennech fully armed , though our orders were directly opposite . I need not tell you that I have made the decision any man of the Fleet would make . " This is our final campaign . Within a short time we shall orbit Coar herself and force her surrender . That is all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the circuits grew loud , then the monitors shook with a mighty cheer . Later , alone , Jezef congratulated him amusedly . " They are certainly with you a hundred percent now , if there was any doubt before . Yet there was one argument you did n't even hint at ; the strongest argument of all . " " What was that ? " " Why , you 're offering them a chance at life and freedom , where they might be going to imprisonment or execution . " That irritated Tulan . " I 'm sure you 're not so cynical about Fleet loyalty and tradition as you pretend , " he said stiffly . " I would n't affront the men by using that kind of an argument . " Jezef grinned more widely . " Did it even occur to you to use it ? " Tulan flushed . " No , " he admitted . * * * * * Teyr and her moon Luhin , both in quarter-phase from here , moved steadily apart in the viewers . Group One 's screen of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovering occasional roboscouts which were promptly vaporized . Far behind , Group Two showed as a small luminescence . It would never be visible to Luhin as anything else , and then only when Tulan was ready . They reversed drives , matched speeds neatly , and went into forced orbit around Luhin . On the flagship 's first pass over the beleaguered oval of ground held by Sennech 's forces  --  unsupported and unreinforced since the home planet 's defection  --  Tulan sent a message squirting down . " Tulan commanding . Is Admiral Galu commanding there ? Report situation . " The next time around a long reply came up to them . " This is Captain Rhu commanding . Galu killed . Twenty percent personnel losses . Six Lights destroyed ; moderate damage to several Mediums and one Heavy . Ground lines under heavy pressure . Ships ' crews involved in fighting at perimeter . Food critical , other supplies low . Several thousand wounded . Combat data follows . " There was a good assessment of the struggle , with some enemy positions that were known . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground troops included five Heavies and other craft in proportion , besides the transports and supply ships . Alone , they 'd been pinned down by superior enemy ground forces and by a sizable fleet holed up all around the satellite . With Tulan 's support they could be taken off . Tulan composed orders . " Withdraw ships ' crews from lines and prepare to lift . Get wounded aboard transports and prepare to evacuate troops . Set up fire control network to direct our ground support . " The tedious job of shrinking the perimeter , a short stretch at a time , began , harassed by the quickly adapting enemy . During the first twenty hours the hostile fire was all from ground projectors , the enemy ships not risking detection by joining in . By that time one section of the front had pulled back to where several ships , sheltered in a crater , would have to lift . Lines of men and equipment converged on the ships and jammed aboard . The actual lift was preceded by a diversion a few miles away , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off in unison , slanting back across friendly territory and drawing only light missiles which the defenses handled easily . * * * * * Then , suddenly , a salvo of heavy stuff came crashing in , too unexpected and too well planned to stop . One of the lifting ships , a transport , vanished in a great flash . Tulan yelled into his communicator . " Plot ! Where did that come from ? " " I 'm sorting , sir . Here ! A roboscout got a straight five-second plot before they downed it ! " " Intelligence ! " Tulan snapped . " Get the co-ordinates and bring me photos ! " There were already pictures of the area where the salvo must have originated , and one of them showed a cave-like opening in a crater wall . " That 's it ! " Tulan jabbed a pencil at it . " You could hide a dozen ships in there . Let 's get a strike organized ! " * * * * * The strike group included four Heavies besides the flagship , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a jerky evasive course while pictures flashed on screens to be compared with the actual terrain . Ground fire , chemically propelled missiles , erupted ahead of them and the small craft went to work intercepting it . They were down to a hundred miles , then fifty , streaking along the jagged surface so close they seemed to scrape it . This was point-blank range ; as the computers raced with the chaos of fire and counter-fire , human senses could only register a few impressions  --  the bruising jerks , the shudder of concussions , white streaks of rocket-trails , gushers of dirt from the surface , winking flashes of mid-air interception . Then the Heavies were on target . The flagship jumped as the massive salvo leaped away  --  not chemical missiles , but huge space torpedoes propelled by Pulsor units like the ships ' drives , directing their own flocks of smaller defensive missiles by an intricate network of controls . The small stuff , augmented by fire from the lighter ships , formed momentarily a visible tube down which the big stuff streaked untouched . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers of shattered rock as they ripped by , rocking and bucking with the blasts . Tulan 's viewer swivelled aft to hold the scene . Secondary blasts went off like strings of giant firecrackers . Great black-and-orange fungi-like clouds swirled upward , dissipating fast in the thin atmosphere . Then Tulan spotted what he was looking for : three small ships flashing over the area , to get damage-assessment pictures . There was still a lot of ground-fire from farther out , and it caught one of the three , which wobbled crazily then disappeared in a flash which blanked out the viewscreen . " Intelligence ! " Tulan shouted . " Casualties ? " Intelligence was listening to his earphones and punching buttons . " Two Lights lost , sir . Slight damage to seven more and to one Medium . " " All right . Get a telecopy of those pictures as soon as you can ; we certainly hit something . Maybe a Heavy or two . " He relaxed , aching , and reflected that he was getting a little mature for actual combat . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the enemy had been taught his lesson . Groups of ships lifted almost constantly . The final position was an oval forty by sixty miles , held almost entirely from the sky . The last evacuees straggled in like weary ants , and when the radio reported no more of them the last fifty ships lifted together and ran the gauntlet with slight losses . Tulan pulled the Force away for rest and repair . Group Two was idling at extreme radar range , making a convincing blip , and he designed some false messages to be beamed toward it with the expectation of interception . The impression he wanted to give was that Group Two was the Force that had been bombarding Coar , coming in now to join him . Actually , the latter fleet was farther away , hidden in the sun and , he hoped , unsuspected. * * * * * Things were going according to plan except for one puzzling item : there was no message from Sennech 's small garrison on Teyr . All he could get from the planet was a steady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been conquered by Coar 's . He 'd been hoping to get certain supplies from Teyr , and now he took a strong detachment in close to the planet to find out what was wrong . The threat finally raised an answer . " This is the Chief of Council . What is it that you want ? " " Chief of Council ? What are you talking about ? I want the Garrison Commander . " " I suppose you 're Admiral Tulan . There 's been a change here , Tulan ; Teyr is now an independent planet . Your garrison , with Coar 's , comprise our defense forces . " Tulan stared at the planet 's image . " You 're at war with Coar ! " " Not any more , we are n't . " There was a chuckle . " Do n't sound so shocked , Admiral ; we understand you 're in mutiny yourself . " Tulan slapped the microphone onto its hangar . He sat , angry and bewildered , until he remembered something , then buzzed Communications . " Get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have sixty thousand troops in transports , with almost no food . I intend to land them . " " They 're welcome as noncombatants , Admiral . They 'll have to land disarmed , in areas we designate , and live off the country . We 've already got more refugees than we can handle . " " Refugees from where ? " " Have n't you been in contact with Sennech at all ? " " No . " " Oh . " There was a thoughtful pause . " Then you do n't know . There 's bad radiation in the atmosphere and we 're hauling as many away as we can . We can use your ships if you 're finished playing soldier . " Tulan broke the connection again and turned , fuming , to Jezef . " We 'll blast our way in and take over ! " Jezef raised his eyebrows . " What good would that do ? " he asked . " Why ; they  --  for one thing , we 've got to think of those troops ! We ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savages ! " Jezef grinned . " I doubt if they 'll refuse to let them have enough small arms to defend themselves . They ca n't stay where they are . " " But they 're military men , and loyal ! " " Are they ? The war 's over for them , anyway . Why not let them vote on it ? " Tulan jumped up and strode around the command room , while Jezef and the staff watched him silently . Gradually , the logic of it forced itself upon him . " All right , " he said wearily , " We 'll let them vote . " * * * * * A few hours later he studied the results gloomily . " Well , after all , they 're not Fleet . They do n't have the tradition . " Jezef smiled , then lingered , embarrassed . " Well ? " Tulan asked . " Sir , " ( that had n't come out , in private , for years ) " I 'd like to be relieved . " It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He stared at his brother-in-law , feeling as if he faced an amputation . " You think I 'm wrong about this whole thing , do n't you ? " " I 'm not going to judge that , but Sennech 's in trouble far worse than any question of politics , including your own family . " " But if we turn back now Coar will recover ! It 's only going to take us a few more hours ! " " How long does it take people to die ? " Tulan looked at the deck for a while . " All right . I 'll detach every ship I can spare , and put you in charge . You 'll have the transports too , as soon as they 're unloaded . " He stared after Jezef , wanting to call out to him to be sure to send word about Anatu and the boys , but somehow feeling he did n't have the right . * * * * * He took the fighting ships away from Teyr , to where Group Two could join up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were crossing to intercept Coar . A few miles in , where they 'd be hidden in the sun , he left a few scouts . As he saw it , the enemy commander on the satellite , noting the armada 's course and finding himself apparently clear , would have no choice but to lift his ships and start around the sun by some other path to help his planet . That other path to Coar could be intercepted , and as soon as Tulan was lost near the sun he went into heavy drive to change direction . He drifted across the sun , waiting for word from his scouts . At about the time he 'd expected , they reported ships leaving the satellite . He looked across the room toward Plot . " Plot ! Feed that data to Communications as it comes in , will you ? " And to Communications : " Can we beam Group Three from here ? " " Not quite , sir ; but I can relay through the scouts . " " All right ; but make sure it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Luhin , and I want them to get running reports on the enemy . " " Right , sir . " Tulan was in the position he wanted , not needing to use his own radar , but able to pick up that of Coar 's fleet at extreme range , too far to give them a bounce . He 'd know their course , speed , and acceleration fairly well , without even being suspected himself . He held that position until the enemy was close enough to get a bounce , then went into drive on an intercepting course . One of the basic tenets of space maneuver was this : if two fleets were drawing together , with radar contact , neither ( barring interference from factors such as the sun or planets ) could escape the other ; for if one applied acceleration in any direction the other could simply match it ( human endurance being the limitation ) and maintain the original relative closing speed . When the enemy commander discovered Tulan 's armada loafing ahead of him , he 'd been accelerating for about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per hour , while Tulan was going the same direction but at half the speed . The quarry began decelerating immediately , knowing it could get back to Luhin with time enough to land . Tulan did n't quite match the deceleration , preferring to waste a few hours and lessen the strain on his crews . He let the gap close slowly . He could tell almost the precise instant when the other jaw of his trap was discovered , for Plot , Communications , and Intelligence all jerked up their heads and looked at him . He grinned at them . What they 'd picked up would be an enemy beam from Luhin , recklessly sweeping space to find the Coar fleet and warn it of the onrushing Group Three . The enemy commander reacted fast . It was obvious he 'd never beat Group Three to Luhin , and he made no futile attempts at dodging , but reversed drives and accelerated toward the nearest enemy , which was Tulan . Tulan was not surprised at that either , for though Coar 's fleets had bungled the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like men . He matched their acceleration to hold down the relative speeds . The swift passing clash would be brief at best . He formed his forces into an arrangement he 'd schemed up long ago but never used : a flat disc of lighter ships out in front , masking a doughnut-shaped mass behind . He maneuvered laterally to keep the doughnut centered on the line of approach . * * * * * Roboscouts appeared and blossomed briefly as they died . The fuzzy patch of light on the screens swelled , then began to resolve into individual points . The first missiles arrived . Intricate patterns of incandescence formed and vanished as fire-control systems locked wits . A sudden , brilliantly planned salvo came streaking in , saturating the defenses along its path . Ships in Tulan 's secondary formation swerved frantically , but one darting , corkscrewing missile homed on a Heavy , and for an instant there were two suns . Tulan , missing Jezef 's smooth help , was caught up in the daze and strain of battle now . He punched buttons and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemy 's subtle swerving . Another heavy salvo came in , but the computers had its sources pinpointed now , and it was contained . These first few seconds favored the enemy , who was only fighting the light shield in front of Tulan 's formation . Now the swelling mass of blips streaked apart in the viewers and space lit up with the fire and interception . Two ships met head on ; at such velocities it was like a nuclear blast . Then Coar 's ships crashed through the shield and into the center of the doughnut . Ringed , outgunned , outpredicted , they hit such a concentration of missiles that it might as well have been a solid wall . Ships disintegrated as if on a common fuse ; the ones that did n't take direct hits needed none , in that debris-filled stretch of hell . Tulan 's flagship rocked in the wave of expanding hot gasses . There was a jolt as some piece of junk hit her ; if she had n't already been under crushing acceleration away from the inferno she 'd have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destruction was a bright slash across space , growing into the distance with its momentum . It was annihilation , too awful for triumph ; there was only horror in it . Tulan knew that with this overwhelming tactic he 'd written a new text-book for action against an inferior fleet . He hoped it would never be printed . Sweating and weak , he slumped in his straps and was ill. * * * * * While brief repairs and re-arming were under way , he sent scouts spiraling out to pick up any radio beams from Sennech or Teyr . There were none . The telescopes showed Sennech 's albedo down to a fraction of normal ; that , he supposed , would indicate smoke in the atmosphere . He wavered , wondering whether he should detach more ships to send out there . Reason and training told him to stick to the key objective , which was Coar 's surrender . He waited only for Group Three to achieve a converging course , then started around the sun again . They did n't encounter even a roboscout . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , matched speeds , and coasted along a million miles ahead of the planet , sending light sorties in to feel out any ambushes . Still there was no sign of fight , so he went in closer where the enemy could get a good look at his strength . Finally he took a small group in boldly over the fourth planet 's Capitol and sent a challenge . The answer was odd . " This is Acting President Kliu . What are your intentions ? " Tulan realized he was holding his breath . He let it out and looked around the silent command room , meeting the intent eyes of his staff . He had an unreal feeling ; this could n't be the climax , the consummation  --  this simple exchange over the radio . He lifted the microphone slowly . " This is Admiral Tulan , commanding the Fleets of Sennech . I demand your immediate and unconditional surrender . " There was something in the reply that might have been dry amusement : " Oh ; by all means ; but I hope you 're not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do n't give a damn about the war ; we 're worried about the race . " There was more silence , and Tulan turned , uncertainly , looking at the bare spot where Jezef ought to be standing . He buzzed for Communications . " Connect me with Captain Rhu . Rhu ; I 'm advancing you in rank and leaving you in charge here . I 'm going down to accept the surrender and find out what this man 's talking about . " * * * * * Kliu was gaunt and middle-aged , wearing , to Tulan 's surprise , the gray of Coar 's First Level of Science . He was neither abject nor hostile , agreeing impatiently to turn over the secret of Coar 's weapon and to assist with a token occupation of the planet . Again Tulan had the unreal , let-down feeling , and judging by Kliu 's amused expression , it showed . Tulan sent couriers to get things started , then turned back to the scientist . " So you have had a change of government . What did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him for a moment . " How much do you know about the weapon ? " " Very little . That it projects matter through hyperspace and materializes it where you want it . " " Not exactly ; the materialization is spontaneous . Mass somehow distorts hyperspace , and when the projected matter has penetrated a certain distance into such distortion , it pops back into normal space . The penetration depends mainly upon a sort of internal energy in the missile ; you might think of it more as a voltage than as velocity . You 've made it very hard for us to get reports , but I understand we successfully placed stuff in Sennech 's crust . " " Yes ; causing volcanoes . Our scientists speculated that any kind of matter would do it . " " That 's right . Actually , we were projecting weighed chunks of rock . When one bit of matter , even a single atom , finds itself materializing where another already is , unnatural elements may be formed , most of them unstable . That 's what blew holes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tulan considered the military implications of the weapon for a few moments , then pulled his mind back . " I see ; but what about the radiation ? It was n't more than a trace when I left . " Kliu looked away for a while before answering . " When we learned you 'd defied your government , our own military got out of hand . They had a couple of days before the sun cut us off completely , and they began throwing stuff as soon as it could be dug and hauled to the projectors . They used high energies to get it past the sun . As we realize now , a lot of it hit the planet deeper than at first , below the crust . Under such pressure a different set of fissionables was formed . Some of them burst out and poisoned the atmosphere , but most of them are still there . " He leaned forward and eyed Tulan hard . " We 've got to get an expedition out there to study things . Will you help ? " There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tulan 's voice sounded unnatural . " I  --  yes ; we 'll help . Whatever you want . Is ... Sennech finished ? " Kliu smiled tightly . " Sennech , for sure ; and she may take the rest of us with her . Nobody conceived what this might come to . A lot of those deep materializations produced pockets of dense fissionables , and they 're converging toward the center under their own weight . When they get to a certain point , we 'll have a fine monument to Man 's ingenuity . A planet-size nova . " He stood up . " I 'll start organizing. " * * * * * Tulan existed someway through the preparations , and when they were in space again the solid familiarity of his ship helped . His staff was carrying on wonderfully ; shielding him , he suspected , from considerable hostility . Discipline held up . A technology that had spanned five orbits and probed beyond was at bay , and the expedition was tremendous . Hardly an art or science was unrepresented . If need be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beam from Teyr as they passed told of refugees by the hundreds of thousands , dumped in the wilderness with a few ships still trickling in . Tulan would have traded everything he could command to hear a word of Jezef or the family , but Teyr was n't concerned with individuals and he did n't ask . Sennech was dull gray in the telescopes , showing , as they neared , flecks of fire . They went in fast , using her gravity to help them curve into a forced orbit as they strained to decelerate . Thermocouples gave readings close to the boiling point of water ; that , probably , was the temperature of the lower air . Roboscouts went down first , then , as conditions were ascertained , manned ships . Tulan took the flagship down once . Her coolers labored and her searchlights were swallowed in murk within a few feet . Sounds carried through the hull ; the howl of great winds and the thumps of explosions . Once a geyser of glowing lava spattered the ship . Within hours the picture began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by transient mountain peaks which tumbled down in quakes or were washed away by the incessant hot rain . It would have been hard to find a single trace of the civilization that had flourished scant hours before . * * * * * The slower job was learning , by countless readings and painful deduction , what was going on inside the planet . Tulan occupied himself with organizational tasks and clung to what dignity he could . After an eternity Kliu had time for him . " She 'll blow , all right , " the scientist said , sinking tiredly into a seat . " Within half a year . Her year . " " Twenty thousand hours , " Tulan said automatically . " How about the other planets ? " " Coar has one chance in a hundred , Teyr possibly one in ten . " Tulan had to keep talking . " The outer satellites . We can do a lot in that time . " Kliu shrugged . " A few thousand people , and who knows what will happen to them afterward ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ System 's inhabitable again , if ever . " " Ships ... people can live a long time in ships . " " Not that long . " " There must be something ! The power we 've got , and this hyperspace thing . " Kliu shook his head . " I can guess what you 're thinking ; we 've been all over it . There 's no way to get to the stars , and no way to move a planet out of its orbit . Do n't think we have n't been pounding our skulls , but the figures are hopeless . " Tulan stared at the ulcerous image on the screen , built up by infra-red probing through the opaque atmosphere . " She looks ready to fall apart right now . How much of her could you blast off ? " Kliu smiled wearily and without humor . " We 've worked that idea to the bone , too . If you could build a big enough projector , and mount it on an infinitely solid base , you could push something deep enough and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it 's a matter of energy and we ca n't handle one percent of what we 'd need . Even if you could generate it fast enough , your conduits would melt under the current . " He got up and walked a few steps , then sat down again . " Ironic , is n't it ? All we can do is destroy ourselves . " Tulan 's mind could n't accept it ; he was used to thinking that any amount of energy could be handled some way . " There must be something , " he repeated , feeling foolish as he said it . He went over the figures he knew so well ; the acceleration and the total energy necessary to drive a ship to the nearest stars . Even a ship 's Pulsors , pouring energy out steadily , were pitiful compared to that job . Schoolboys knew the figures ; mankind had dreamed for generations ... He sat up abruptly . " This hyperspace ; did n't you tell me there were such things as velocity and momentum in it ? " Kliu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And that a projector could be built to put an entire ship into hyperspace ? " Kliu stared at him for a second . " Kinetic energy ! Built up gradually ! " He jumped to his feet . " Come on ! Let 's get to the computers ! " * * * * * Several hundred hours later Tulan lay watching the pinpoint on his viewscreen that represented Sennech . He 'd been building up speed for a long time ; he ached from the steady double-gravity . The ship , vastly beefed up , was moving at a good fraction of the speed of light . It would n't be much longer . The cargo of carefully chosen matter , shifting into hyperspace at the right instant , would be taken deep into Sennech by the momentum he 'd accumulated in normal space . If the calculations were right , the resulting blast would knock a chunk completely out of the planet . Each of the thousands of other ships tied to him by robot controls would take its own bite at the right time and place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a few hot moments , and would be full of junk for a long time , but the threatening fissionables inside Sennech would be hurled far apart , to dribble away their potence gradually . Kliu admitted no one could calculate for sure even how much , if any , of Sennech would remain as a planet , but Teyr , at least , with her thick atmosphere , should withstand the rain of debris . He wondered about his family , and Jezef . Kliu had tried to get word , but the tragically few refugees were scattered . He smiled , recalling how severely he 'd had to order his staff to abandon him . He was proud to remember that much of the fleet would have come along , if he 'd let them ; but live men were going to be at more of a premium on Teyr than heroic atoms drifting in space . Machines could handle this assault . He himself had not had to touch a single control . The indicators began to flash , and , sweating with the effort , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be winding up here in his own command room , where he 'd lived his moments of triumph . Still , as the red light winked on , he could n't help thinking how very quiet and lonely it was without Jezef and the staff . THE END
