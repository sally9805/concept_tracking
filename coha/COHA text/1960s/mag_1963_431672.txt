 | My Life Among Wild CHimpanzees U P ON THE MOUNTAINS the midday sun glared fiercely , but down in the valley near the swift-funning stream it was cool and still . I stood listening until I heard a faint rustling of leaves ? the only sound to betray the presence of the group of chimpanzees I was trying to approach . Slowly and quietly , but making no attempt to hide , I moved toward the great apes until I was only thirty feet away . As I sat down , they watched me , staring rather hard , and a young female who had been lying on the ground climbed a little way up a tall fig tree . One of the males stood upright to watch more closely . He was a superb specimen , standing about 41/2 feet in height , his massive shoulders and bull neck suggesting the tremendous strength in his arms . He must have weighed a good 130 pounds , and he was strong enough to snap with one hand a branch so tough that a man would be hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to learn how it feels to be slammed on the head from behind by a large male chimpanzee , but fortunately for me he did not continue his attack .

The six adults rested on the ground or @# stretched out along the branches of a wild Nearby , four youngsters played quietly . I thought then , as I always think whet am face to face with mature chimpanzees their native forests , of the striking differences between the wild apes and those in captivity The chimpanzee imprisoned behind bars bad tempered in maturity , morose , mood , and frequently rather obscene ; in his freed he is majestic even when excited and , for most part , dignified and good natured .

Africa Fulfills a Life 's Ambition To be accepted thus by a group of wild chimpanzees is the result of months of pa tience . In England , before I commenced my field study , I met one or two people who had seen chimpanzees in the wild . " You 'll never get close to chimps ? not unless you 're very well hidden , " they told me . At first it seemed they were right , but gradually I was able to move nearer the chimpanzees , until at last I sat among them @#  | rain forests of the Congo and west coast . The more open country of the Gombe Stream Reserve is ideal for field study , though the behavior of apes living there might not be the same as that of apes in the dense forests . Our talk as we sailed the lake was about chimpanzees , and one of Ranger Anstey 's stories persuaded me that they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ African who decided to climb an oil-palm tree to cut down some nuts for cooking oil . A chimpanzee was high in the tree , feeding on the nuts , but the African failed to notice the animal untyhehadclimbed well up the trunk . The ape , intent on feeding . only then saw the African , started rapidly down , and as he passed the man , hit out at him , slashing away half his cheek and one eve as he did so . At about 2 o'clock on the afternoon of Jul. 14 , 1960 , we arrived at Kasekela , a campsite midway along the 10-mile coastline of the reserve . The motor launch went back to Kigoma , with orders to return for David a few days later . We found ourselves on the beach . @#  | surrounded by untidy-looking crates and bundles , together with the small boat and its outard motor which would be our only link a ith civilization . Our permanent party numbered four : myself ; my mother ; Dominic , our African cook ; and Dominic 's wife . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that first day , we found e heat almost intolerable , but the big tent - as soon pitched and everything bundled side . I shall always remember David 's exression when he found that our only tableware consisted of a couple of tin plates , a cup without a handle , and a thermA top ! Indeed , w e were equipped with only the barest essentials , and I think even Dominic was secretly shocked . During the first two months of my field studies , I often despaired . Each dawn I set out alone , following the little streams as I explored the valleys one by one , forcing my way through the dense undergrowth or scrambling up the steep slopes . Sometimes I saw a group of chimpanzees feeding in a tree , but seldom managed to get close before the shy apes moved away . Frequently I heard their noisy calling , but usually they had moved off before I could catch up with them . Disheartened , I trudged wearily back to camp each dusk . But those early days , however frustrating , initiated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer seemed hostile after I learned to creep along pig trails instead of forcing my way through the undergrowth . The slopes were no longer a nightmare when I had discovered the baboon trails where I could pull myself up the steepest parts by roots worn smooth by constant use . I became acquainted with other animals : troops of vervet and redtail monkeys ; the beautiful red colobus monkey ; the shy bushbuck ; the fat ginger bush pig . One morning , while walking along the lake shore , I was approached by an excited fisherman who showed me a tree into which a bull buffalo had chased him the night before . " Huyu kali sana , " the man said . " He 's a bad one , this fellow . " Indeed , the tree was scored by innumerable 279  | gashes from the buffalo 's horns . Mostly , however , the small herds are wary and hard to approach . Once I did have to climb a tree , when I met two crotchety old bulls along a narrow track . My climb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion of them . " I 'd rather meet a rhinoceros or a lion any ( lay . I am more frightened of the buffalo than of any other creature in Africa . " Often I saw the tracks of a leopard , or recognized its powerful feline smell , and sometimes I heard the soft rasping of its hunting calf . Many months later I saw one . He passed only a few yards away in the long grass , and I felt slightly apprehensive . But when he winded me he turned silently away . One-girl Camp Set Up Near Chimps I never attempted to hide , and gradually the animals became used to the strange paleskinned primate that had invaded their territory . After about six months , most of the chimpanzees would sit and look at me calmly at distances of 100 yards . At first they tied if they saw me within 500 yards . Three-quarters of an hour 's climb from camp , I discovered a peak overlooking two valleys and many open grassy ridges and slopes ? an ideal place for long-distance observation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to get closer . I had a tin trunk carried up there , with blanket , electric torch , a couple of tins of baked beans , coffee , and a kettle . When the chimps slept close by , I stayed up in the mountains near them . So , gradually , I began to learn the basic behavior patterns of the chimpanzees , and after six months I was able to pick out and name some individuals . When I saw Mike lazing in the sun , for example , or Count Dracula ambling past , it was like meeting a friend . People often ask me how I choose such names for individual chimpanzees . My answer is that some names ? such as Mrs. Maggs , Spray , and Mr. McGregor ? simply come to mind . Strange as it may sound , some chimpanzees remind me of friends or acquaintances in some gesture or manner and are named accordingly . One chimpanzee had a pale , flesh-colored face instead of the dark color common in adults . It gave me a slightly eerie feeling when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was " Count Dracula . " Study Extended by Society Grant When the three preliminary months came to an end , the National Geographic Society took over sponsorship of my research and financed a further 20 months . My mother had to return to England , but by then I was accepted by the authorities and so was allowed to stay on at the reserve . At this time I was joined by Hassan , of the Kakamega tribe , an African who had worked for Dr. Leakey for 15 years ? a most responsible and reliable helper . He took over the little boat and the monthly trip to Kigoma for stores and mail . The trial period was over , and I could settle down to building a closer contact with the apes . Chimpanzees are nomadic within their territory , and they follow no fixed circuit . They have no regular sleeping trees . Most chimpanzees in the reserve ? probably between 60 and 80 individuals ? range , at various times of year , over the whole 60 square miles , and sometimes beyond the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they may travel as much as eight or ten miles in a day ? depend on the seasonal availability of the fruits , leaves , and blossoms that form the bulk of their diet .  | The chimpanzees ( luring much of the year move about in small groups of three to six animals . Such a group , I discovered from observation , may consist of adult males and females , of females and juveniles , of males only , or of a mixture of sexes and ages . During the day two or three small groups may join and move about together for a few hours or a few days . In certain seasons , mainly when some kind of favorite fruit is plentiful , I have often seen as many as 25 chimpanzees together . What makes the social pattern so complicated is that the small groups are not stable . When two groups which have joined temporarily separate again , there has frequently been an exchange of individuals . Males often leave the group they are with to move about alone , subsequently joining another group or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it harder to recognize individuals , yet it is essential to do so before one can even begin to understand the social pattern . From my mountaintop perch , I observed how chimpanzees go to bed . Every night each one makes its own sleeping platform , or nest ? except for the small infants , which sleep with their mothers until they are about three years old . Treetops Provide Springy Mattresses The construction of a nest , I found , is simple and takes only a couple of minutes . After choosing a suitable foundation , such as a horizontal fork with several branches growl out , the chimpanzee stands on this and ben down a number of branches from each side that the leafy ends rest across the foundation . He holds them in place with his feet Finally he bends in all the little leafy twi that project around the nest , and the bed ready . But-the chimpanzee likes his comfort and often , after lying down for a moment , he sits up and reaches out for a handful of leafs twigs which he pops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then he settles down again with obvious satisfaction . One evening I sat quietly below a group five chimpanzees that were feeding in a tree  | There was Mrs. Maggs with her two offspring : little Jo , about two years old ; and Spray , then about five . There was another mature female , Matilda , and a young male , Hugh . Just before sunset there was excited calling as another male joined the group . Spray climbed down from the tree and ran up the slope to greet him . As they climbed the tree together , I saw that the newcomer was Mr. McGregor , an old male who had lost the hair from his shoulders and was almost completely bald-headed ? a rarity in chimpanzees . The group fed quietly until the sun had almost vanished behind the mountains across the lake , and then Mrs. Maggs began looking for a place to make her nest . She tested the branches exactly the way a person tests the springs of a hotel bed . One by one , the other apes began to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun finally sank out of sight . Mrs. Maggs was lying on her back in her completed nest . As the chill of night crept into the air , little Jo ran to her mother , who put out her arm and drew the young one close to the warmth of her body . Darkness fell swiftly and I climbed to my mountaintop lookout post , opened a tin of beans , and boiled my kettle over a little fire @#  | The moon was nearly full , and the mountains were beautiful and rather ghostly when I returned to the chimpanzees . I disturbed them as I settled down with my blanket about 50 yards away , and they began to call out loudly , alerting a troop of baboons sleeping in the valley below . The chimpanzees soon quieted down , but the baboons went on barking for a long time . The chimpanzees slept soundly for the rest , f the night , but I was perched halfway down a steep slope with only a small tree to keep me from slithering into the ravine below . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it grew lighter I gradually made out the @# dark shape of Mrs. Maggs , with Jo curled up beside her . Soon Jo sat up , yawned , and gazed about . Mrs. Maggs rolled over onto her back , flung out an arm , and also yawned . Jo jumped onto her chest , leaned forward , and pressed her face against her mother 's , flinging her arms around her neck . Chimps Awake in Mood for Fun The other apes began to move . I could see Matilda sitting up in her nest and Spray feeding in a tree close by . Jo became restless . She climbed to a branch above the nest and hung down , kicking and twisting from side to side . Her mother reached  | @# up and patted her , pushing her to ' and fro , until Jo , delighted , tumbled down on top of her . Mrs. Maggs , her legs in the air , bounced Jo up and down with her feet and then suddenly bent her knees so that Jo collapsed in a heap of waving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten minutes ; then Mrs. Maggs suddenly sat up and peered down through the branches . Matilda had left her nest , and sounds below indicated that the others were moving away . Mrs. Maggs touched Jo , who jumped to her at once , clinging under her belly as the mother swung down from the tree . When a chimpanzee is born , it is almost . helpless as a human baby , save that it - apidly develops great strength in hands and feet , enabling it to cling to its mother 's long hair as she travels from place to place . For the first four months the infant never leaves its mother , but after this it begins to venture first a few feet and then a few yards away . It is still very unsure of itself , and the mother is always ready to reach out should it lose its balance . Babies Play Like Human Children By the time the infant is about a year old , it has more confidence and spends hours playing gently , hanging from a branch and patting at its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If two infants play together , they pat out at each other or have a tug-of-war with a twig . Always the games are slow and gentle . By the time they are about two years old , the little apes are very active and their playing far more adventurous . Whether they are swinging and leaping around in a tree or rolling over and over on the ground , they never seem to be still for a minute . Their elders , particularly the adolescents and the younger males , are amazingly goodnatured with them . I once watched little Fifi tormenting an adolescent male , Figan . He was resting peacefully when Fifi hurled herself onto him , pulling his hair , pushing her fingers into his face , biting his ears . She swung above him , kicking out , while he indulgently pushed her to and fro with one hand . Finally , exhausted for the moment , she flung herself down beside him . From the age of about three years the young chimpanzee becomes more and more independent . Often it still moves around with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it no longer rides on her back or sleeps in the nest with her at night . Games become rougher and wilder , wrestling and chasing being the favorite sports . Occasionally a small infant tries to join in ,  | then the older ones treat it with great consideration . I saw one youngster swinging an infant gently by one arm and then , after peering down , she dropped the little one to a leafy platform a few feet below . When the : fant had difficulty in climbing up again , she gave a helping hand . At about eight years , the chimpanzee child mains puberty , and during the next three or . ur years of adolescence it gradually takes place in adult society . How long it might live , no one can say pending further study , but a good guess for average life span in the wild would be 40 to 50 years . Chimps Express Feelings in Action In this society , relationships among the adult apes are more harmonious than had been assumed from observations of chimpanzees in captivity . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would imagine that wild chimpanzees were always fighting and quarreling . When two groups meet there is sometimes a fantastic cacophony as the males call loudly , drum on tree trunks , and shake branches , while the females and youngsters scream and rush out of the way . But this is merely excitement and pleasure ; with his highly emotional extrovert temperament , the chimpanzee likes to express his feelings in action . When squabbles do arise , often over the merest triviality , they are usually settled by gestures and loud protest . Once I was watching a youngster feeding peacefully beside an adult male . By chance , they both reached for the same fruit . The youngster immediately withdrew its hand , but screamed loudly and " flapped out " at the male . The male screamed and flapped at the youngster . This went on for a few moments and then the quarrel ended , neither ape having touched the other . Relationships between mature and adolescent males are particularly harmonious ? they do not even fight over females ! I once saw seven males in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of jealousy or antagonism . As to mating in general , chimpanzees in captivity breed all year round , and it seems likely that this is the case in the wild , because females appear receptive toward males during all months of the year . In addition , I saw small infants in April , June , September , and October . During September and October , however , when the chimpanzees are frequently seen moving about in large agg'regations , excitement , caused by this social stimulation , does appear to have a very marked effect upon reproductive behavior . I saw the animals mating almost daily during these two months ? spring in Tanganyika . Thus , although it would appear that a certain amount of mating must take place throughout the year , there is , apparently , a very definite mating season . Mutual grooming plays an important part in the social life of chimpanzees , and two friends , or even a small group , will sit quietly for hours searching through each other 's long black hair for specks of dirt , grass seeds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this grooming activity the first beginnings of true social and altruistic behavior in the whole animal kingdom . Calls and Gestures Serve as Language I am often asked , " Do chimpanzees have a language ? " They do not , of course , have a language that can be compared with our own , but they do have a tremendous variety of calls , each one induced by a different emotion . The calls range from the rather low-pitched " hoo " of greeting , and the series of low grunts that is heard when a chimpanzee begins to feed on some desirable food , to the loud , excited calls and screams which occur when two groups meet . One call , given in defiance of a possible predator , or when a chimpanzee , for some reason , is angry at the approach of another , can be described as a loud " wraaaah . " This is a single syllable , several times repeated , and is one of the most savage and spine-chilling sounds of the African forest . Another characteristic call is a series of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | hoot , and ending with three or four roars . This is the cry of a male chimpanzee as he crosses a ridge . It seems to be an announcement to any other chimpanzees that may be in the valley below : " Here I come . " These calls , while they are not a language in our sense of the word , are understood by other chimpanzees and certainly form a means of communication . In addition , chimpanzees communicate by touch or gesture . A mother touches her young one when she is about to move away , or taps on the trunk when she wants it to come down from a tree . When a chimpanzee is anxious for a share of some delicacy , he begs , holding out his hand palm up , exactly as we do . He may pat the branch beside him if he wants a companion to join him there . When two animals are grooming each other and one feels that it is his turn to be groomed , he often reaches out and gives his companion a poke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another , I saw a female going round poking at each of them in turn . But shewas completely ignored ? and so sat down sadly and groomed herself ! There are also many gestures of greeting and friendship . Sometimes when two friends meet after a separation , they fling their arms around each other in a delighted embrace . @# 290  | Despite this fairly well-developed system of communication , a chimpanzee suddenly confronted with danger gives no alarm call to warn his companions , but simply runs off silently . Defiant Glares Greet Visitor This was the way the apes initially reacted to my presence , but after a few months fear gave place to curiosity . Curiosity , in turn , changed to defiance . Then , instead of running away or peering suspiciously at me , some of the chimpanzees would climb into the trees and rock the branches , glaring at me in silence . Those silent " displays , " as modern scien-291  | tific zoologists call them , were still tinged by fear , and it was many months before the chimpanzees were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the first time when I was following a group in thick forest . The chimpanzees had stopped calling when they heard my approach , and I paused to listen , unsure of their whereabouts . A branch snapped in the undergrowth right beside me , and then I saw a juvenile sitting silently in a tree almost overhead , with two females nearby . I was right in among the apes . I sat down . Then I heard a low " huh " from a tangle of lianas to my right , but I could see nothing . Then came another " huh " behind me , and another in front . Curiosity Prompts an Attack For about 10 minutes these uneasy calls continued . Occasionally I made out a dark shape in the undergrowth , or saw a black hand clutching a liana , or a pair of eyes glaring from beneath black , beetling brows . The calls grew louder , and all at once a tremendous bedlam broke out ? loud , savage yells that raised the hair on the back of neck . I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shaking branches snapping off twigs . One climbed a small ling right beside me and , all his hair st. on end , swayed the tree backward and ward until it seemed he must land on ti me . Then , quite suddenly , the display over and the males began to feed quietly side the females and youngsters . On one occasion I was actually hit chimpanzee in the wild , but this was prom by curiosity rather than aggression . I was waiting near a ripe fruit tree w s - heard footsteps in the leaves behind me. wanting to startle the apes , I lay down , ho ? that they would reach the fruit tree wt seeing me . But the footsteps stopped , heard small , high-pitched sounds behind " Hoo ! Hoo ! " The inflection told me the c panzees were surprised or uneasy . I did not move , and suddenly a m. male climbed into the tree above me and scarcely 10 feet over my head , peering do at the strange object below . I think he was  | puzzled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me from the rain . He worked himself into a rage , hitting the trunk and shaking the branches . His small hoots became louder until , with mouth wide open to show yellow canines , he was uttering high-pitched , choking screams of anger . Still I did not move . Through the corner of my eye I could see three others watching . All at once the male disappeared , and I heard him moving in the leaves behind me . There was a silence and then , with a loud scream , he rushed forward and I felt the slam of his hand on the back of my head . The experiment had gone far enough ? the fate of the African who had lost an eye and half his cheek in an encounter with an angry chimpanzee came to mind . Slowly I sat up , and at last the ape realized exactly what I was . He moved away with his companions , still brave from his passion , calling out and drumming on the trees . Later I talked with Dr. Leakey about the incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or cries that would have further enraged the chimpanzee . " If you had waved your arms , shouted , or shown anger in any way , " he said , " you might have been killed . He was merely testing to find out if you were an enemy or not . " Gradually , during the months of my study , the apes became less aggressive , until finally I was greeted almost as another chimpanzee ? sometimes by a show of excitement with hooting and shaking of branches , and sometimes by a complete lack of interest . 293  | On the whole the chimpanzees merely tolerated me , but one , a mature male in the prime of life , went a stage further , and tolerance became friendship . David Greybeard ? he , deserves an article to himself . It was during the eighth month of my research , when the fruit was ripe on one of the oil palms outside my tent , that David paid his first visit to camp . Dominic told me about it when I got down from the mountains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had called again , and so I determined to wait in camp to try to see him . I recognized him at once from having seen him in the forest ; he had always been particularly unafraid of me there . He visited camp almost every day for about a week , and then the nuts were finished and he stopped coming . David Provides a Wonderful Moment When more palm nuts ripened , however , David again visited us . Even in those early days he sat feeding calmly while I walked about under the trees . I discovered that he liked bananas too and left a few out for him . Gradually he became tamer and tamer , but it was not until the last five months that David showed complete confidence in his human friend . Two of the palms in camp were ripe , so I got in a great supply of bananas and voted myself to David for a whole week . After three days he actually took a ban from my hand . It was a wonderful mo - He was apprehensive when I held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tree , rock ' slightly from foot to foot . But when he ti the fruit there was no snatching ? he was amazingly gentle from the first .

" of greeting . Soon David began popping into camp any old day , whether there was a palm with fr or not . Dominic and Hassan were both d lighted and would describe David 's visits i detail when I returned from the mountain in the evenings .

Once when William had a dreadful cold , he slept in the same nest for three nights , a most unusual procedure ( page 283 ) . Each night it poured rain , and when he climbed down in the morning he was shivering violently , and coughing and wheezing so that I longed to give him a hot toddy instead of a cold banana . Chimpanzees often call out if it rains during the night . They sit up in their nests , hunched forward over their knees with heads bent down , and wait until the rain stops . I never observed them attempting to make a shelter or to take advantage of any natural one .

These clinics , started by my mother when we first arrived at the reserve , were a tremendous help in establishing and maintaining friendly relations with the Africans . My most faithful patient was eight-yearold Jamanne ( page 290 ) . He always managed .. o think up some complaint , and was happiest when he could produce a minute scratch and demand a strip of adhesive tape . But his chief delight lay in helping me , handing out the medicine and explaining to the fishermen in the most superior manner how they should take it . During the rains the chimpanzees tend to go to bed earlier and get up later , and when they rest during the day they often make themselves a day nest in a tree rather than lie on the cold , damp ground . At these times infants still sleeping with their mothers at night make little nests as a sort of game , and very instructive play it is . An infant of about eighteen months finds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; each time it reaches out for a second one , the first springs up again . But by the time the young one is ready to sleep alone , it has mastered the nest-making technique . Rain Incites a Violent Ritual Generally speaking , chimpanzees become more active during the rains and often , for no apparent reason , a male will break into a run , slapping the ground or hitting out at a low branch as he passes . This behavior , when large groups are present , may develop into a fascinating display which I have called the " rain dance . " I saw it on four occasions , always about midday and always in similar terrain . In every instance it followed the same pattern , but the duration varied from 15 to 30 minutes . It did not always take place in the r a , in , but rain 301 @#  | was falling hard the first time I saw it I was watching a large group of chimpanzees , 16 in all , feeding and playing in a tree halfway up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threatening all morning and finally it came down , gently at first . becoming gradually heavier . When the rain started , the chimpanzees climbed down from the tree one by one and sat for a while on the ground before starting off up the grassy slope . They had divided into two groups , with four large males in one group and three in the other . As they neared the ridge at the top . one of the males suddenly turned and charged diagonally downward , slapping the ground , calling loudly , and hitting at a tree as he passed . At once a male from the other group turned and began to run down the slope . Standing upright , he tore a low branch from a tree , waved it for a moment , and then dragged it behind him as he ran . Meanwhile the females and juveniles were climbing trees near the skyline to watch . At the top of the slope another male stood upright , rocking slightly from foot to foot . his arms swinging , working up momentum . @#  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off a great bough as he went . Two more set off , calling wildly . One after the ether they sprang up into a tree and , without a pause , hurled themselves some 25 feet to the ground , tearing off branches as they fell and dragging them on their downward run . At the bottom , each chimpanzee swung up into a tree to break his headlong rush . There he sat for a moment before climbing down to plod up to the top of the slope once more . Then , with loud cries , he was off again . Thunder Roars Above Apes ' Wild Calls All the time the rain pelted down , harder and harder , while lightning streaked across the leaden sky and crashing thunder almost drowned the wild calling of the apes . Against the new green grass they looked very black and huge ? like primitive , hairy men displaying their strength ( painting , pages 298-9 ) . For about half an hour I watched ; and then , as suddenly as it had started , the display was over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one by one the chimpanzees wandered up to the ridge and disappeared over the top . The last male paused on the skyline , looking back toward me with one hand on a tree trunk ? the actor taking his final curtain . Then he , too , was gone . Rain seems to have more effect on some chimpanzees than others . Goliath in particular often gets very excited at the start of a rain storm , and once he did a fantastic dance all by himself , swaying rhythmically from foot to foot , tearing down huge branches , and gradually becoming wilder and wilder . William , who was sitting close beside him at the start , paid absolutely no attention . David Greybeard is inclined to become truculent in the rain . Once during a thunderstorm , when I was sitting on the banana box to try to prevent his taking all the fruit , he came and stood upright in front of me , hooting loudly , with one arm raised above his head . He then danced about , hitting a tree , the box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Occasionally a group of baboons gathers round David while he is eating bananas . Sometimes he ignores them , but often , and particularly when it is raining , he chases them off , swinging his arms and hooting .  | The relationship between the chimpanzee and the baboon is complex and interesting . The ape is the larger and more powerful animal , but the baboon is far more numerous and represents the chimpanzee 's only serious competitor for food . For the most part the two species tolerate each other , and it is common to see baboon and chimpanzee feeding in the same tree . On the other hand , I have seen a group of chimpanzees leap out of a tree at the approach of a baboon troop . On one occasion a fairly young male baboon climbed up into a palm where David and William were feeding and began to taunt William , going up to him , barking and hitting out at him . William hit back and the two fought for a moment . Then both chimpanzees climbed from the tree , leaving the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ female and juvenile chimpanzees , which rush away screaming . Often one or two male chimpanzees then join in , chasing after the baboons , which flee in turn . These mock battles seem to be a strange mixture of play and aggression . I once watched a troop of baboons teasing four adult chimpanzees ? two males and two females . The male baboons insolently moved closer and closer to the apes ? until , all at once , the latter seemed to lose their tempers . The males stood upright and charged at their tormentors , swinging their arms over their heads . The females leaped to the low branches of a tree and , leaning down , screamed @#  | piercingly at the baboons below . I thought a real fight would take place , but after a few moments the male chimpanzees returned from the chase , and both apes and baboons walked peacefully on . It would seem that the chimpanzee and the baboon tolerate each other because each , to some extent , has respect for the other . But these happy relations do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gombe Chimpanzees Eat Meat It will be a surprise to many to learn that the chimpanzee in the wild has definite carnivorous tendencies . It has always been suspected by scientists that wild chimpanzees might eat an occasional lizard or small rodent , but no one thought these apes might kill fairly large animals . As far as I can determine , the fact that they do so came to light for the first time during my research . This behavior may not be common to all races of chimpanzees in Africa , but it is certainly true of those of the Gombe Stream Reserve . Monkeys seem to be a favorite item on the menu . I saw them eaten on four occasions , and twice I found bits of bone in the chimpanzee droppings . In addition , I once saw a young bushbuck eaten , and another time a young bush pig . Four times the prey was unidentifiable . I saw chimpanzees eating meat several times before I actually saw them attack and kill . On that occasion the prey was a red  | colobus monkey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tall , leafless tree when - uddenly a young chimpanzee climbed into a neighboring tree . He sat close enough to one of the monkeys to attract its attention , t not close enough to scare it away . Meanwhile another young chimpanzee bounded up tree in which the monkey was sitting , ran with incredible speed along the branch , leaped at the colobus , caught it with its hands , d presumably broke its neck . Five other chimpanzees then climbed up , including a mature male . But because an adolescent had made the kill , the carcass was torn up and shared among the whole group , with no fighting or quarreling . At other times , however , when the prey is in the possession of a mature male , there is no such sharing . The others in the group show respect . They sit as close to the male as they . in , watching the meat with longing eyes , holding out their hands palm uppermost in a begging gesture . William Pays Price for Grabbing The reaction of the male to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was eating a young bushbuck . He was clasping the carcass with one arm , and it was , incidentally , almost as big as himself ! Presumably he had broken its neck , just as other chimps had killed monkeys . In his free hand Huxley held a bunch of twigs and after each mouthful of meat he ate a few leaves ? for all the world like a man with a lump of cheese and a stick of celery . Gathered close round Huxley , and all begging , were three other large males J. B. , Hollis , and William . Several times Huxley tore off a piece of meat and put it into the outstretched hand of J. B. Once Hollis begged from J. B. and was rewarded with a small bloody splinter . When a youngster of about four years held out its hand , Huxley , after a moment , very gently cuffed it on the head , but a female with a tiny infant was allowed to feed from the carcass unmolested . The sight of this female tucking it in proved too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begging in vain . He ventured to help himself to a bite . Evidently it was one thing for the mother to share in the spoil , but quite another when William tried to join in . Huxley at once grabbed William and bit him , at which J. B. came racing down and chased the screaming William from the tree . There was a good deal of yelling and crashing around in the undergrowth , and then the two climbed back into the tree . They sat near Huxley , who at once hit William four or five times , after which J. B. did the same . Poor William tried neither to escape nor to retaliate . He simply sat there screaming and took his medicine . And then he reached out to touch the lips of his punishers in the gesture of appeasement , and all was peaceful again . William was not forgiven , however , to the extent of a handout . Raw meat , though obviously a great delicacy , is only an occasional supplement to the chimpanzee 's diet . Whether the apes deliberately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kills because of opportunity , remains undetermined . I suspect the latter . The bulk of the diet is , of course , vegetarian . I have collected 81 different types of vegetable foods eaten by chimpanzees , of which half consists of fruits , a quarter of leaves , and the remainder of seeds , blossoms , stems , and bark . Epic Discovery Reveals a Tool-maker In addition , however , the chimpanzees sometimes feed on insects ? at certain times of the year fairly extensively . I have seen them eating termites , two species of ant , and two types of gall , a tumorlike growth on a leaf in which the young gallfly lives . And it is this method adopted by the chimpanzees for feeding on ants and termites that probably represents the most important discovery in my two years of research . For a long time there has been heated discussion in scientific circles as to whether any primates in the wild ever modify natural objects to make tools . My chimpanzees have settled the argument once and for all : The answer is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a chimpanzee carefully feeds a length of vine into an opening it has made . Probing the mound while the long-winged insects await good flying weather , he gets ahead of baboons and birds , which can not join the feast until the termites swarm out of the mounds . The chimpanzee 's short thumb prevents his bringing it and forefinger together in the precision grip so useful to man . As a substitute , this ape clamps the stem between thumb and side of the index finger .  | Termites form a major part of the chimpanzee diet for a two-month period . The termite season starts at the beginning of the rains , when the fertile insects grow wings and are ready to leave the nest . At this time the passages are extended to the surface of the termite heap and then sealed lightly over while the insects await good flying weather . The chimpanzee is not alone in his taste for termites ? the baboon in particular has a fondness for the juicy insects , but he must wait until they fly and then take his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ termites as they leave the nest . The chimpanzee forestalls them all . He comes along , peers at the surface of the termite heap and , where he spies one of the sealed-off entrances , scrapes away the thin layer of soil . Then he picks a straw or dried stem of grass and pokes this carefully down the hole . The termites , like miniature bulldogs , bite the straw and hang on grimly as it is gently withdrawn . I have watched chimpanzees fish this way for two hours at a time , picking dainty morsels from the straw and munching them with delight . When they do n't have much luck with one hole , they open another and try again . As the straw becomes bent at the end , the chimpanzee breaks off the bent pieces until the tool is too short for further use . Then it is discarded and a new one picked . Sometimes a leafy twig is selected , and before this can be used the chimpanzee has to strip off the leaves . In so doing ? in modifying a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? the chimpanzee has reached the first crude beginnings of tool making . Chimps Carry Tools on Termite Search In this respect , the chimpanzees do not always await the discovery of a termite nest before seeking a tool . I have seen them break off a twig and carry it for as far as half a mile , going from one termite hill to another , though none at the time was suitable for feeding . It is unlikely that this practice of fishing for termites is an inborn behavior pattern . Among higher primates , behavior is found to depend more and more on learned techniques and less and less on " instincts . " It seems almost certain that this method of eating termites is a social tradition , passed from ape to ape by watching and imitation . As such , it must be regarded as a crude and primitive culture . We do not know yet if similar traditions have developed among other chimpanzee populations in Africa . The answer may throw interesting light on the spread and development of culture in early man. * Meat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out whether capture and eating of prey is common to all chimpanzees or peculiar to those of the Gombe Stream Reserve . Perhaps this is simply a local tradition , in which case there is always the possibility that it might develop and eventually involve more elaborate hunting techniques . At present these chimpanzees appear merely to take advantage of any good opportunity that presents itself for the killing of prey ? as was perhaps the case with early man . It seems important that in the future recurring observations should be made of the meateating and hunting behavior of this chimpanzee population . In the chimpanzee , there is reason to speculate that overspecialization has not led to an evolutionary dead end , as may be the case with the other great apes . Of course , if the forests of Africa were cleared for agriculture . the chimpanzee would not survive in competition with man . But if the forests gradually disappeared due to changing climate or similar causes , I think it is interesting to conjecture that the chimpanzee , with his primitive hunting and tool-using , might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself to the new conditions . There is still much to learn about the behavior of the free-ranging chimpanzee . I am returning to the Gombe Stream Reserve for a further six months , again with the generous support of the National Geographic Society . After that I hope to make behavior studies in other parts of Africa , because , until we have sufficient comparative data , we can not tell if the behavior of the Gombe Stream chimpanzees differs from those in other regions . Only after we have such data can we draw far-reaching conclusions about the way of life of the chimpanzee , which with the other great apes is the most nearly human of all the animals inhabiting the earth today . @#
