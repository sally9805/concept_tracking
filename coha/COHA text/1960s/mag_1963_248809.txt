They came from all over : a mill hand from Leningrad , a crown prince from Oslo , an oilman from Houston-some of the best small-boat sailors in the world . Two were former world champions , four were Olympic gold medalists , five had won the Scandinavian Gold Cup . For seven days , on the wind-lashed waters of Long Island Sound , they battled for the world 's 5.5-meter sailing championship . And when the contest ended last week , they sadly packed their sail bags and left the championship to C. Raymond Hunt , 55 , a bespectacled grandfather from Tilton , N.H. , who had never before sailed a 5.5-meter in international competition . <P> Though he was once regarded as a topflight Marblehead helmsman , Hunt now does most of his sailing on a designer 's drawing board . He helped pioneer the popular International 110 and 210 classes , developed the ultra-highspeed ( 50 m.p.h . ) " Moppie " powerboat hull , designed the 5.5-meter Minotaur that Massachusetts Yachtsman George O'Day sailed to victory in the 1960 Olympics . Hunt showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5.5 , Chaje II , built by Finnish Shipbuilder Jussi Nemes . The two planned to race her together . But Nemes had to rush home at the last minute-his shipyard had burned to the ground-and he asked Hunt to take over . <P> $20,000 for Speed . Like a Grand Prix car , a 5.5-meter sailboat is a specialized piece of handiwork , designed for speed , not for family fun . The 5.5s range from 28 ft. to 35 ft. in length , must conform to a complicated formula that requires each " plus " ( larger sail area ) to be balanced by a " minus " ( heavier weight ) . Built in the U.S. , a 5.5-meter hull costs about $15,000 ; designer 's fees , tank tests and sails boost the bill another $5,000 or more . Running before the wind , under an 800-sq. - ft. spinnaker , a 5.5-meter can skim along at 8 knots . But a sailor is well advised to take along a reliable Mae West and a strong Australian crawl . " You 've got to be rugged , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last week 's championship a sailor 's nightmare . One early race had to be postponed for lack of wind , but by the end of the seven-race series , swells were running 10 ft. high , and a 30-m.p.h. easterly buffeted the 34-boat fleet . " Are you sure we 're in the right place ? " asked one skipper . " This looks like the North Atlantic . " <P> Computers &; Jumpers . Contestants raced around a six-leg , 10-mile course , won points according to the Olympics scoring system , so involved that Texas ' Albert Fay complained , " You need a dadgum computer to find out where you stand . " Olympic Champion O'Day won one race , was disqualified in the next when he failed to hear the recall horn after a false start , wound up a woeful twelfth in the competition . Norway 's Crown Prince Harald was so eager that he beat the gun in the last race , thus costing himself a chance for second place overall instead of eighth .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
