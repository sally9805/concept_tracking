txt The city 's Landmarks Preservation Commission - yesterday denied the Penn Central Company perinission to erect a soaring $100-million office building atop Grand Central Terminal . The railroad , which owns the terminal , said immediately that it would appeal the decision in court . The commission 's ruling , by a vote of 8 to 0 , came after more than a year of controversy among planners , architects , civic groups and politicians . Two proposals were rejected by the ruling : one for a 55-story tower that would have kept intact the southern Beaux Arts facade , and one for a 56-. story tower that would have demolished the facade . " To protect a landmark , " the commission 's report said , " one does not tear it down . To perpetuate its architectural features , one does not strip them off . " The commission designated Grand Central as a landmark on Aug. 2 , 1967 , calling it " one of the great buildings of America . " " In style it represents the best of the French Beaux Arts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commission last April , both Penn Central representatives and the proposed building 's chief architect , Marcel Breuer , argued that the essence of the landmark was the main concourse inside the station . Mr. Breuer and the railroad promised to restore and preserve the concourse if the commission would allow Morris Sa // ady , a British developer , to putt up the building . The city 's Landmarks Preservation Law , passed in 1965 , gives the commission jurisdiction over building exteriors , not ' interiors . Citing this limitation , Har mon H. Goldstone , the commission chairman , said , " We ca n't give away something we have no control over . " Mr. Breuer had remarked at the April hearing : " There has always been some question in the minds of informed people as to whether the exterior of Grand Central Terminal is worth preserving . " Mr. Goldstone , however , , countered yesterday by saying that " it 's one of the few buildings in New York City that has a grand , ceremonial approach . " In its report , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it said were " ri in dramatically terminated vistas . " Examples of Vistas New York , it observed , had " Trinity Church at the end of Wall Street , Washington Arch at the foot of Fifth Avenue and the RCA Building ' it the end of the Rockefeller Center gardens . " " Yet none of these " the report continued , " have the sweep that Park Avenue still pievides for the Grand Central Terminal from the south . " The Beaux Arts facade , built in 1913 , faces south down Park . Triumphal arches surround high , steel-framed windows . Massive Greek columns stand beneath a group of statues , 48 feet high , of Hercules , ' Mercuryand Minerva around a clock 13 feet in diameter . Even if the facade were preserved , the commission said , a building only 30 feet away would compete with it brutally . " All the softening effects of distance and all the present sense of separation would he lost , " it contended . The Pan Am Building , put up before the station was designated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the facade , the commission noted , and thus allows the terminal to be seen in perspective . Furthermore , Mr. Goldstone said , a landmark in that congested part of the city provides " a breathing space , culturally and emotionally , a sense of oasis . " However , Murray Drabkin , the lawyer for Penn Central , contended that the railroad needed the revenue from the building to meet yearly deficits on operating the terminal . Mr. Saady had agreed to lease the rights for $3-million a year . The chairman of the Planning Commission , Donald H. Elliott , opposed the Breuer building , but offered instead to change zoning rules on surrounding Penn Central property to permit the construction of large office buildings around the station . In its report , the commission said the railroad could reapply on the ground of economic hardship . Mr. Drabkin disputed this , however , asserting that it first would have to forfeit the partial tax abatement it enjoys on the terminal . Landmarks rulings have withstood previous court challenges . The commission first received Penn Central 's application @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no exterior effect . " The proposal was rejected Sept. 20 , 1968 . Then last Jan. 20 , the railroad resubmitted the first plan , which would have saved the facade , with a second proposal to demolish it , in application for a " certificate of appropriateness . " It was this certificate that the commission unanimously denied yesterday , with three of its 11 members absent .
