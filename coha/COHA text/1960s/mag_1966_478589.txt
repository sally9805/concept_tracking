There is currently much huffing , puffing , wheeling and dealing about the New York Port Authority 's intent to build a colossal World Trade Center on the lower West Side of Manhattan . As presently designed , this fearful instrument of urbicide will be not only the tallest , but unquestionably one of the ugliest buildings in the world . Each of its two 110-story towers will dwarf the Empire State Building by a hundred feet , and together these arrogant twins will woefully clobber Manhattan 's beautiful skyline . One might assume that the whole , crowded island ought to be a center of world trade as it has been , with considerable success , for about two hundred years . But that is a na ? vely outmoded assumption at a time when merchandising dominates not only commercial but practically all human affairs . Sound merchandising these days means to wrap whatever it is you have to offer , be it items for personal ablution or of international diplomacy , into one , big , neatly styled package and sell the hell out of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore proposes to wrap business , government , and consular offices for 50,000 people ? a quarter again of all the office space constructed in Manhattan in the past twenty years ? plus exhibition space , a hotel , and sundry facilities into onehuge steel-and-concrete package and dump it on thirteen historic , living and breathing square blocks of the city ? between Barclay and Liberty Streets and Church Street and the Hudson River wharfs . Another 80,000 people , says the Port Authority , will visit the center every day . It says nothing , however , about the traffic congestion this concentration of 130,000 people on sixteen acres is bound to cause during working hours . After a thorough briefing on various aspects of this real-estate venture by eager Port Authority officials at their Manhattan headquarters , I was recently shown a large model of the proposed World Trade Center . Together with numerous drawings and plans , it clearly conveys the impact of the design on its surroundings , though many models of new buildings , unfortunately , do not . Shock ? viscerally felt shock ? is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one views even so large a model the way Gulliver viewed a Lilliputian toy , this sense of shock stayed with me as I contemplated and studied this Brobdingnagian to the accompaniment of a copious Sow of sales talk by the PA 's PR men . Each of the two towers is relatively slim for its height . They are square shafts , 200 by 200 feet , with such narrow window slits that they appear of solid , gleaming steel , but they are so closely placed together that from most angles they will present one massive bulk . Worse , these incredible giants just stand there , artless and dumb , without any relationship to anything , not even to each other . This awkward placement , I was told , was determined by the fact that the towers must be anchored seventy feet in the earth and there was simply no other space for them on the building site . ( It seems more difficult , somehow , to dislodge existing mechanical installations below ground than buildings and people above it . ) Skyward , the towers go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point , presumably , some engineer finally said " enough ! " and the architects obediently cut them off flat . There is no attempt to meet the sky gracefully , as the spires of the Chrysler or Empire State Buildings do so well . The Piazza San Marco Cult The monsters rise on one corner of a five-acre , paved plaza that covers a garage for 1,600 cars , a maze of subway stations , a new terminal for the Hudson &; Manhattan Railway , which was recently renamed Port Authority Trans-Hudson railroad , no doubt so as to produce the catchy acronym PATH . The plaza is squarely enclosed by a seven-story building , bordered by a reflecting pool ? and adorned with potted trees . The engineering of the towers is ingenious . The columns are here spaced only three-and-a-half feet apart and form the exterior wall , instead of obstructing the interior , as they do in the usual curtain-wall buildings . Between the bars of this tight cage are continuous strips of glass , 22 inches wide , which serve as floor-to-ceiling windows . Another novel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor you can take only an express elevator , a huge box holding 55 passengers , which will take you to a " sky-lobby " on either the 42nd or the 76th floor . From there you transfer to a local elevator that takes you up or down to your destination . The human inconvenience of having to take two elevators for each trip yields the building owners another 10 per cent net rentable office space compared to the conventional system . The architects are Emery Roth &; Sons , who have been responsible for some sixty of New York 's more recent and less attractive office buildings , and Minoru Yamasaki , who , with Edward Durrell Stone , is currently the most popular architectural kitsch-monger . When it came to giftwrapping the World Trade package , the Piazza San Marco in Venice was obviously much on the architects ' mind . Along with mystical gobbledegook about " space " ( dynamics of space , interpenetration of space , spatialism , spatial experience , and whatnot ) and " human scale , " the Piazza San Marco has lately become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , all that can be said about space is that ten million square feet of it will be rentable for offices and another five million for exhibits . The scale is utterly inhuman . And unless the Port Authority manages to attract some pigeons to its plaza , the World Center 's only resemblance to San Marco is the vaguely Venetian Gothic shape of the spindly arches on which Yamasaki rests the huge towers and which he echoes on a kind of ornamental grille that drapes the low buildings . The plaza itself is about a fifth larger than San Marco , which ever surprisingly turns , once you have passed its wonderful bell tower , toward its delightful , wide-open encounter with the Canale Grande . Yamasaki 's plaza originally did nothing . It was bare and square and opened only ( and rather theatrically ) toward narrow Church Street . The view of the Hudson was solidly blocked . The Center , in fact , turned its back to the port which it is to serve . Along the waterfront it presented only one unbroken four-blocks-long building facade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visually blighting elevated highway has already caused . When New York City Planning Commission architects pointed out to him that this would tend to perpetuate the highway blight , Yamasaki revised his scheme somewhat . To enhance the architectural impact , " he announced March 17 , 1966 , the plaza 's solid frame is to be broken up into freestanding buildings . The towers now stand alone and the low buildings are irregular in plan . This allows narrow openings which are , however , still but slits toward the river . The plaza now has a more interesting shape , a pavement pattern , and a fountain . The riverfront fa ? ade has somewhat mere distinction . But these architectural design improvements cannot. redeem the basically impossible notion of grafting all this rentable square footage on a single , small segment of the city 's complex tissue . The project appears much like one of those Buck Rogers schemes of " the city of the future " we 've seen in the comics for years and which have more amused than frightened us . We have never taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and surrealist wastelands of these visions are now creeping up on us . New York 's Pan Am Building , which woefully overcrowds and visually destroys the Grand Central area , was only a beginning . The hideous Prudential Tower that you can not escape wherever you go in Boston is an act of character assassination of one of our proudest cities . Chicago is building an ugly steel-braced glass colossus 1,100 feet tall , the John Hancock Center , which will at least contain apartments as well as offices , but which , nevertheless , promises to disrupt not only the appearance but the urban ecology of the downtown area . The future , it seems , has already arrived . But we neither control nor plan it . We are stumbling into the futuristic nightmares we never took seriously . All that has been said and written in the past . few years by men like Lewis Mumfurd about making the city human and livable has gone unheard and unheeded . True . the Empire Slate Building , in its time , also added a new seemingly shocking scale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the limit of the humanly endurable . Joan of Are and Her Brigades The new gigantism murders the city as we know and love it , fur the sole reason that it is now technically possible to build ever-larger structures promising ever-larger profits for their owners . But the fact that we can build them gives them neither practical nor moral justification . We can do a lot of things technically , including the ultimate destruction of life on this planet . Our problem in urban design , as in a good many other current concerns , is nothing more or less than to exercise reason and restraint . We could also use a little creative imagination . But creativity in approaching the problems of the city in general ? or those of the New York Port Authority in particular ? must spring from a comprehensive concept of what we want the city to be and where we are going . Without such a positive concept and the will to make it stick , protestations , however eloquent , are futile . There is no lack of opposition to the World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ businessmen on the site who are to be displaced . There is also a Committee to Oppose the World Trade Center , headed by Raymond S. Rubinow , director of a small philanthropic foundation and an altruistic warrior for many good civic causes . Foremost in his ranks is the Joan of Arc of sensible urban planning , Jane Jacobs , author of The Death and Life of American Cities , and that wonderful , wise , and humane Dean of Protest , Norman Thomas . These groups , reinforced by what someone has called " the perfume brigade , " a bevy of civic-minded ladies who storm the zoning , school-board , and public-welfare hearings all over the land , have advanced a multitude of complex arguments ? legal , fiscal , and humanitarian . All of them have merit . So far , however , the mighty Port Authority has considered these opponents an insignificant nuisance . They may still have their day in court , however , when the city 's Board of Estimate holds its public hearing on whether or not the Port Authority may close the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ central issue is that our cities must be remodeled so they can thrive and provide open spare , housing , transportation , and the amenities their inhabitants need to live in decency , safety , and dignity . It is also that people ? like it or not ? insist on driving private automobiles and are likely to continue to insist until some less bothersome kind of private vehicle comes along . That seems unlikely for quite some time . These facts wo n't yield to mere protests . Jane Jacobs and her many friends are right , of course . The city ought to be urbane and urban , humane and human , intimate , friendly , varied , and all the rest . But to win we need plans and ideas that intelligently reconcile Jane Jacobs ' laudable objectives with practical needs . This is where our pusillanimous architects and planners have badly let us down . They talk about spaces , about human scale , about the Piazza San Marco and urban design . But few have put sound , new ideas on their drawing boards . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one out of four persons living within a twenty-five-mile radius of the Statue of Liberty depends for that living on the port of New York . The Port Authority 's job , of course , is to keep him living well and securely . It was established in 1021 by the States of New York and New Jersey to operate and modernize piers and docks , to build airports , tunnels , bridges , and highways , to keep passenger traffic and cargo moving smoothly . New York 's share of American overseas trade , however , has dropped from 33 to 18 per cent in the past ten years . This is due to various factors . There is , for one , increasingly effective competition from other Atlantic and Gulf ports . Although since World War II some $440 million have been spent on improvements , port facilities , in the view of international experts , are still grossly behind and often outright inefficient . New York 's labor costs are high . Among the lesser problems is the handling of paper work , which the Authority 's executive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the load of inefficiency , waste , and lost time . " Government and consular offices , banks , insurance companies , exporters , importers , freight forwarders , steamship lines , and other agencies , he says , are scattered across Manhattan . Messengers have to carry papers all over town to accomplish various transactions . The Port Authority therefore wants all these agencies in one place , equipped with modern electronic communications and data-processing machinery , as well as exhibit space for the display of domestic and foreign products . The Center is to include a new consolidated quarters for the U. S. Customs , which has long outgrown the Customs House at Bowling Green and operates its appraising offices and stores a mile and a half away at Varick Street . But none of this requires the huge venture the Port Authority proposes . There is another story which the Port Authority and its prolific press releases do not tell : A World Trade Center was first considered twenty years ago . A corporation , set up to study the matter , reported that a Center was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facilities . The Downtown Lower Manhattan Association , headed by David Rockefeller , kept the idea alive , however . At Rockefeller 's instigation the Port Authority suggested in 1958 that a 98 WORLD 'S TALLEST FIASCO more modest Center , dominated by a seventy-six-story building , be erected at the East River near Wall Street and the Stock Exchange . Under the governorship of Nelson A. Rockefeller , the New York State Legislature approved the project in 1961 . But the New Jersey legislature wanted none of it , and that was the end of that , since the Port Authority is a bi-state agency and needs New Jersey 's approval . New Jersey did , however , want the Port Authority to take over and modernize the Hudson tubes of the nearly bankrupt Hudson &; Manhattan Railway , which takes 28 million passengers a year to their jobs across the river . This , in turn , seemed rather unappealing to the Port Authority . As Edward T. Chase pointed out in the June 1960 issue of Harper 's , it has consistently neglected the problems of mass transportation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of deficit operations . PATH costs the Port Authority well over $10 million a year to operate . But the Rockefellers saw a deal : The Port Authority would take the Hudson tubes and New Jersey would consent to the Center . To finance the railway , the Center would be expanded into an extensive real-estate enterprise considerably beyond its actual needs . In 1962 both New Jersey and New York ratified this package arrangement with almost identical legislation . The courts have upheld it in two different law suits . After three years of intensive soliciting it turned out that World Trade businesses and consulates were n't as eager to rent space in the proposed Center as the Port Authority had hoped ; in January 1964 , Governor Rockefeller suddenly announced that New York State offices in the city would move in ? to the tune of about a quarter-million square feet ? to take up the slack . Port Authority officials tell me that about 75 per cent of the rentable space is now committed . It may thus turn out to be an advantageous deal for the Port @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , a tax-exempt agency . And although it will pay the city $1,250,000 a year in lieu of real-estate taxes , its opponents estimate that a private entrepreneur would have to pay about $20 million a year . The Port Authority , like urban renewal , also has the power of eminent domain to appropriate any property it deems suitable for its enterprises . Unlike urban renewal , however , it need show no evidence that a substantial part of the appropriated area is blighted . The Fulton Street area it proposes to take is not a slum by any stretch of the imagination . There are now 280 retail stores , seventy manufacturing , warehousing , and industrial premises . as well as dozens of apartments on the World Trade Center site . Many of the buildings here are dingy ; some old houses are downright dilapidated with their upper stories boarded up and either used for storage or altogether empty . Down towird the dead shadow of the elevated highway and the closed docks , it gets a bit dismal . But throughout the area there is intense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is New York 's and perhaps the world 's busiest electronic retail center ? so-called " radio row . " People come from all over the whole metropolitan area to find special parts for hi-fi sets and television gadgets . Ever since the crafts guilds of the Middle Ages , such spontaneous concentration of specialized skills and stores ? a tremendous convenience for both shopkeepers and their customers ? has been one of the wonders of the city and one of the ingredients of urban vitality . Funeral Expenses Covered ' The Port Authority officials were most anxious that I should understand that it intends to assist with the relocation of these merchants , much as the federal urban-renewal program does . It will pay finders ' fees to brokers who locate a new store or apartment for its victims and cover their moving expenses up to $25,000 . In short , it is willing to pay for the funeral of another one of the city 's unique institutions , for " radio row " will , of course , be scattered to the winds . This is tragic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by GO per cent in the past decade . If New York City had an intelligent , comprehensive plan , that plan might , indeed , show that some of the port 's paper work ought to be more closely concentrated around the new PATH terminal ; nevertheless the amenity and economic advantage of " radio row " could undoubtedly be preserved . If need be , the entire market might he moved , lock , stock and electronic tubes , to a suitable new location . San Francisco , among other cities , has successfully relocated its produce market recently and although the merchants were suspicious at first , they seem happy now . An intelligent , humane , and comprehensive plan would also weave the needs of world trade into the existing pattern of the Hudson waterfront . They would not be stuffed into a bureaucratic ghetto but interspersed with apartments , other businesses , cafes , restaurants , and stores where residents , visitors , and traders would spontaneously meet and rub elbows . Consular offices that have fled congested old downtown for more elegant midtown quarters might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Inside , if need be , these could be remodeled to accommodate modern office needs . But their exteriors would have to be restored , much as New Haven restored its fine old houses on Court Street for new uses . New buildings would be carefully scaled in size and character to their environment . There might , to be sure , be a new skyscraper or two . But they could so easily be handsome and fitting additions to the skyline rather than its ruination . A new Port Authority building might well proclaim a splendid new plaza , not a bland , vast expanse of pavement , but an intimate , imaginatively designed one . A good example of such an intimate , human little square is the one William Paley of CBS is giving to the city . If the Port Authority 's planners are worried that its world traders would be spread too far apart in such a scheme , there is nothing to stop it from running small minibuses or electric trains through the area , similar to those now running up and down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California , without destroying a single building . Rather than being stuffed into a big elevator , a trader , on his way to Customs , say , would ride for three or four minutes through a living , attractive city . There is now a new and intriguing plan for lower Manhattan prepared at the instigation of the New York Planning Commission . In essence it suggests enlarging the tip of the island by filling in the East River and Hudson waterfronts for several hundred feet . The added space would he used for parks , underground parking , and a tunneled express highway . This plan skirts the proposed Trade Center area as sacrosanct . But the two proposals might be happily integrated . A new Hudson waterfront could be the main axis along which sensibly dispersed buildings for world-trade activities would extend from Barclay Street to the Battery . Perhaps this would need even greater creative imagination than " skylobbies " but it can be done , and I doubt that , all told , it would be more expensive to the Port Authority than its present insipid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renovation of lower downtown Manhattan there would be many things the city , private entrepreneurs , and various agencies , if they got together on a plan , would want to do anyway . In the end , the Port Authority might even have money left to adorn the area with trees , fountains , sculpture , and benches . The trouble is that neither New York , nor any other American city has a comprehensive plan for the entire city and its people . The World Trade Center fiasco is due mainly to the fact that New York 's and ' New Jersey 's legislators have allowed the Port Authority to plan and impose its own selfish scheme in arrogant isolation . We plan only for special interests ? downtown businesses , housing , or Port Authorities ? and that is urbicide . There is no way to stop it until city planning involves all the people in the city with imaginative , creative proposals , subject to public debate , democratic control , and politics in the best sense of the word .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
