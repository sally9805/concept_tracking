If Nigeria must disintegrate , then in the name of God , let the operation be short and painless . It is better that we disintegrate in peace and not in pieces . <P> - President Nnamdi Azikiwe , December 1964 <P> Azikiwe was overthrown as President in last January 's military coup , but Nigerians last week had ample cause to recall his warning . Another coup had just rocked the nation , and as the details began to emerge , they confirmed the fears that Nigeria , traditionally torn by regional rivalries ( see map ) , had gone through another violent tribal uprising . As a nation , in fact , Nigeria seemed perilously near disintegration . <P> The latest uprising was the work of Northern Moslems , acting to avenge the Southern-led January coup that had thrown them out of power and killed many of their leaders . It was also designed to forestall another coup , which dissatisfied Southern Ibos had reportedly been plotting against the regime they had put in power . The Southern gripe was simple : Major General Johnson Aguiyi Ironsi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Northerners . <P> Panic in Lagos . The coup was a bloody affair . In the Western regional capital of Ibadan , where Ironsi had gone to plead for national unity before a meeting of tribal chiefs and emirs , Northern officers kidnaped him from the governor 's palace and ordered him at gunpoint into a military Land Rover ; his body was reportedly discovered last week outside a nearby village . At the army barracks at Ikeja , near the Lagos international airport , Northerners shot down every Ibo officer they could find , pursued others through Lagos itself , causing widespread panic in the capital ; after one shooting incident , dozens of motorists abandoned their cars to flee on foot , and many foreign residents deserted their homes and took shelter in the swank Federal Palace Hotel . <P> In Enugu , capital of the Ibos ' Eastern Region , Military Governor Lieut . Colonel Odumegwu Ojukwu barricaded himself inside police headquarters , declared his opposition to the new regime and called in Ibo political leaders to line up their support . " After these cruel and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people of Nigeria ever live together as members of the same nation ? " <P> With victory in their grasp , the Northerners ' first idea was to secede and form their own independent state . After a flurry of long-distance telephone conferences , however , and heavy diplomatic pressure from the West , they were persuaded that the backward , semiarid North would be hard put to go it alone without the natural resources of the South and the skills of the Southerners . Agreeing to one more try at nationhood , they named a 31-year-old lieutenant colonel , Yakubu Gowon , as Nigeria 's new supreme commander . <P> Despite his youth , " Jack " Gowon was not a bad choice . A spartan , British-trained officer who neither smokes nor drinks ( his hobby is bird watching ) , Gowon , although a Northerner , is not a member of the region 's dominant Hausa and Fulani tribes . Nor is he a Moslem ; his father , a member of the smaller Birom tribe , is a Methodist missionary . But his task is not easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
