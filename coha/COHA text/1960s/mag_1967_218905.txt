Every 35 minutes , the monster crane with a boom almost as long as a football field plucked a 35-ton concrete box from a waiting truck-trailer and swung it high over the construction site beside the San Antonio River . Ever so delicately , Crane Operator Gene Smith steadied the massive shell against the push of the wind ; every gust was countered by radioed adjustments in the pitch of a helicopter tail rotor mounted on the lifting rig . With directional help from a magnetic compass , Smith gently stacked each concrete box atop an identical unit , to which it was sealed with more concrete . Seventy-two times last week , a guest room was thus lofted into place around the 21-story elevator core of San Antonio 's fast-rising Hilton Palacio Del Rio Hotel . <P> <P> Contractor Henry B. Zachry borrowed the basic idea for his instant-construction technique from Expo 67 's Habitat , a twelve-story Montreal housing complex built of prefabricated concrete apartments piled up like children 's blocks . The method promises to cut construction time on Zachry 's $10 million , 445-room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only by such a speedup could the hotel be completed in time for the April opening of San Antonio 's HemisFair ' 68 , of which Zachry is chairman . Though he estimates that so far the technique itself has cost about as much as conventional construction , the 33% faster schedule will not only save Zachry a bundle of money in financing costs but also enable the hotel to start earning money sooner . And Zachry owns the hotel ; Hilton will lease and manage it . <P> Factory Furnished . The process is remarkably efficient because every guest room is not only precast but completely pre-equipped . Everything from plumbing and wiring to light bulbs , bed linen and furniture ( which is bolted to the floor or walls ) is installed before the rooms leave a factory-like production line seven miles from the site . To allow workmen space to repair pipes and wires in later years , the room modules are set 20 inches apart and the resulting gaps in the hotel 's facade are filled with brick . To provide corridors , the back of each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is sealed to a similar lip to form a 5-ft. hallway . <P> In Russia and much of Europe , builders have been achieving construction economies for years with variations of Zachry 's technique . " This is going to be the trend of the future , " says Manhattan Architect William Tabler , the busiest U.S. designer of hotels . " What Zachry is doing is wonderful . I 'd be doing it too , if we could . " Like most contractors , Tabler blames organized labor for preventing adoption of such cost-cutting methods , sometimes by the threat of tying up a job in jurisdictional disputes , sometimes through covert control of local building codes . In New York City , for instance , Electrical Workers Local 3 will install only light fixtures made by its own members . <P> Zachry faces no such problems . Much building labor in San Antonio remains unorganized . And commercial construction costs , according to the American Appraisal Co. ' s widely used index , rank as sixth lowest among U.S. cities-8% above those in cheapest Savannah , Ga. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costliest New York City .
