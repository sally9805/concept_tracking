When full-scale national election campaigning began three months ago , the ruling Liberal coalition was expected to have little difficulty protecting its majority of 38 in the 125-seat Parliament . Last week , with the final votes still being counted , it was apparent that the Liberals held power-but only just . In the closest tally in years , the opposition Labor Party seemed likely to trim Prime Minister John Gorton 's comfortable margin to at best a half-dozen seats . <P> Almost as soon as the campaigning began , it became apparent that the most important issue of the election was the P.M. himself . Gorton , 58 , took over the party 's leadership 21 months ago , after the disappearance of Harold Holt in a tragic swimming accident . Initially , Gorton was immensely popular . He seemed a refreshing change from his two most immediate predecessors : the aloof , Olympian Sir Robert Menzies and the shy . withdrawn Holt . Then troubles began to pile up . Critics cited his penchant for naming unqualified cronies to high ministerial posts , his reluctance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indiscreet behavior . <P> Making Headlines . An R.A.A.F. World War II hero , Gorton had a habit of flying high . He made headlines when he showed up late one evening at the U.S. embassy , a 19-year-old girl in tow , and spent the next several hours all but ignoring U.S. officials in favor of an enthusiastic tte -- tte with the young lady . A short time before , he had carelessly leaked word of the U.S. bombing halt in Viet Nam before the news had been released in Washington . The White House was annoyed , and so were Gorton 's fellow Liberals . <P> In contrast to Gorton 's unquestioning support for American policy in Viet Nam , the Laborites made it clear that they would pull all 8,000 Aussie troops out of Viet Nam by June-and out of Southeast Asia reasonably soon . Labor Leader Gough Whitlam , 53 , laid out a program of social reforms , including a free health scheme and free university education at a cost of $15.6 million a year , and an emergency school grant of $112 million to cover immediate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take second place in Australian elections to foreign affairs , appealed to the young voters . So did his wit . Once , when Gorton boasted that he wrote his own speeches . Whitlam retorted : " I have listened to the Prime Minister 's speeches and I believe him . " <P> In the end . Labor increased its share of the vote to 48.1% . That represented an impressive 8.1% increase over its 1966 snowing , but was not quite enough . The closeness of the vote was a rebuke to Gorton , and as the week ended , several leading party members announced their refusal to serve under the P.M. There was widespread speculation that Gorton was on his way out .
