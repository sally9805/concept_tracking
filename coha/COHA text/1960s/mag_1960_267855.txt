Republicans Can Gain but Can not Win Control <P> Although 34 U.S. Senators will be elected next month , * the Democrats are certain to retain control of the Senate for at least two years . It is mathematically possible but politically inconceivable for the G.O.P. to take over . Ten of the Senate seats are Southern and automatically Democratic ( Georgia 's Richard Russell and South Carolina 's Strom Thurmond are running unopposed ) . In six other states-Alaska , Illinois , Iowa , Minnesota , Montana , Oklahoma-the Democratic candidates are so far ahead that only a Nixon landslide could beat them . The Republicans are shoo-in favorites in two states- New Hampshire and Nebraska . The real fights are for these 16 slots : <P> Colorado . Republican Gordon Allott , the incumbent , walks the sidewalks with his right hand at the alert for every passerby . His Democratic opponent , chunky Lieutenant Governor Robert Knous , son of a former Governor and federal judge , is campaigning strenuously on a far-out liberal platform . Allott holds a breathless lead , but the race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results . <P> Delaware . Political touts size up the race between Incumbent J. Allen Frear Jr. , conservative Democrat , and Governor Caleb Boggs , moderate Republican , as fifty-fifty , although a successful Democratic registration drive has the G.O.P. worried . <P> Idaho . Republican Henry Dworshak is almost home free for a fourth election , but Democrats cling to a slim hope that Bob McLaughlin , their attractive , aggressive young candidate , may yet turn out to be a sleeper . <P> Kansas . White-thatched Andy Schoeppel , 65 , seeking his third Senate term , has backslapped his way through the state to hold an edge over Frank Theis , 49 , a humorless lawyer and a Democratic Party bigwig . Despite a lackluster record , Schoeppel has a way with Kansas voters ( " He just looks like a Senator " ) . <P> Kentucky . In a dark and bloody ground of national political contention , Kentuckians are paying much more attention to the presidential race than to their own drab Senate campaign between Incumbent John Sherman Cooper and former Governor Keen Johnson . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is probably more liberal than his challenger . Johnson , a prominent businessman ( vice president of Reynolds Metals ) , is locally famed for his frugality : as Governor ( 1939-43 ) , he ran a tight treasury , spent less than the legislature allotted , liquidated the state debt and ran up a surplus of $10 million . Cooper is ahead . <P> Maine . The Democrats lead in every major event but the all-girl Senate race . Incumbent Margaret Chase Smith has come up fast , with a ladylike , personal-touch campaign , is outdistancing her Democratic rival , Lucia Cormier ( TIME cover , Sept. 5 ) , who sticks stolidly to peace and security , aid to education and other national issues .
