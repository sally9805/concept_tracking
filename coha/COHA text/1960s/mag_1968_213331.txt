THE VIOLENT PEACE by Carl and Shelley Mydans. 478 pages . Atheneum. $12.50 . <P> Once when old Otto von Bismarck 's demands had set much of Europe atremble , he was asked if he wanted war . He replied , " Certainly not . What I want is victory . " His remark reflected the attitude of countless uncomplicated ages when men waged their wars with relatively simple weapons for a single purpose . Using every available resource , adversaries simply beat at each other until one side ultimately collapsed and surrendered . <P> All that , of course , was before the Bomb . Since World War II ended , not a single war has been formally declared . Yet it has been a period of almost continuous violence . Besides Korea and Viet Nam , there have been at least 50 other conflicts of major proportions . In this big handsome book , Author-Photographer Carl Mydans and his wife Shelley , both of whom have distinguished themselves as TIME-LIFE combat correspondents , examine a China torn by civil war , the bloody and futile efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Indo-China , the insurrection in Greece , the partition riots in India . In a litany of violence , they tick off wars and disorders in Palestine , Malaya , the big conflict in Korea , Quemoy-Matsu , Algeria , Hungary , Suez , South Arabia , Cyprus , Colombia , Cuba , Venezuela , the Dominican Republic , the Congo , Angola , Indonesia , the Philippines , Laos , Viet Nam , and the third violent clash between Israel and the Arabs . <P> They draw on eyewitness accounts of battle from 44 TIME-LIFE correspondents , and have culled memorable pictures from TIME and LIFE files . Some of the reports remain lodged in memory . There is , for example , Photographer David Douglas Duncan 's report of how a howling mob of Hindus and Sikhs in Delhi flailed to death a six-year-old Moslem girl carrying her baby brother ; TIME Correspondent James Bell 's terse account of weary American troops fighting for No Name Ridge in Korea ; Photographer Andrew St. George 's file on a Castro patrol 's foolhardy attempt to blow up an armored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since the major nuclear powers are deathly afraid of a head-on clash , the Mydanses believe that only total derangement on one or both sides will bring back all-out war . Instead , wars of the future will follow the pattern established since World War II-a conflict fought with limited means and often ending indecisively . <P> The major powers will continue to test one another 's will and strength indirectly on distant battlefields . The authors believe this may be more of a strain on the U.S. than on the U.S.S.R. " Americans tend to look on war as a great moral struggle and are apt to be more receptive to the idea of outlawing it than of merely restricting it . If a war does not involve some high and all-encompassing ideal such as freedom , democracy , a war to end war , Americans are reluctant to go into it . . . To the Communist nations , limited war has an altogether different dimension . In fact , inspiring and supplying ' wars of national liberation ' which they intend to keep as limited wars has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "
