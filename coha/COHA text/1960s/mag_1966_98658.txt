In training camp the Jets performed as extras in the filming of a TV musical about a miserable football team that is transformed into a winner by a messenger of the gods . On cue , the Jets were dropping passes , missing kicks , falling down , fumbling and bumbling like an idiot team when a club official cracked , " I really do n't notice anything different . " Three years removed from the Titans of Harry Wismer , the Jets are different , however , and the real-life presence of Joe Namath may be godlike enough to make them challengers for the Eastern championship . // Bigger , deeper and faster  --  " the fastest team I have ever had , " says Weeb Ewbank , who coached two NFL champions at Baltimore  --  New York is a young team with young ideas . Says Curley Johnson , punter and blithe spirit of the Jets : " The talk around here is title . " // This is fancy talk for a crowd that went 5-8-1 last year and has never had a winning season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half of 1965 when the Jets won five of their last eight games , including a victory over champion Buffalo . Namath , who developed fastest of all , can be one of the best quarterbacks in football . // After taking command of the team midway through the season , Broadway Joe passed for 2,220 yards and 18 touchdowns ; his damaged knee caused little apparent trouble . But this year the knee was wrenched in the Jets ' preseason game with the Oilers , causing some worry . If it holds up through the season no AFL team will get more confident leadership or more poise under fire . Mike Taliaferro is an adequate No. 2. // Namath and Taliaferro throw to wide receivers George Sauer Jr. , Bake Turner and Don Maynard . Sauer , a rookie last year , has taken the starting split-end assignment from Turner . Ten pounds lighter this season , faster and with that important year of experience , he could be one of the league 's best . Flanker Maynard already is . He had a gaudy second half of the season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jim Colclough , obtained from Boston in the deal for Quarterback John Huarte , is a valuable receiver and can fill in on either side . // The Jets went looking for some tight-end help in the draft and got it in Pete Lammons of Texas and Bill Yearby of Michigan . The regular these rookies have beaten is Dee Mackey , who caught well but has had pneumonia . // The Jets ' running game has been weak to the outside but strong between the tackles with Matt Snell , fourth in rushing last season , and Bill Mathis , seventh . Both are fine blockers and pass protectors , and Snell is a sure receiver . Emerson Boozer , a strong and swift first-year man from Maryland State , will give New York outside speed . // The reason the Jets do not worry more about Namath 's valuable knee is the offensive line , which is a superior pass-blocking unit . If it can protect a Dick Wood , who has had five knee operations and is a prospect for six , it can protect a Namath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jet quarterbacks dumped on a rush . In the line the gap at center created by Mike Hudock 's departure for Miami has been filled by John Schmitt , off the taxi squad . The tackles are massive 300-pound Sherman Plunkett , an All-League choice , and 275-pound Winston Hill , and the guards are again Sam DeLuca and Dave Herman . // It is on defense that the Jets must improve substantially if they are to make a serious championship bid . Only Houston had a poorer record against rushing in 1965 . New York started last season with two rookies on the right side of the defensive line  --  End Verlon Biggs and Tackle Jim Harris  --  and a near rookie , Gerry Philbin , at right end . They endured and learned , and with veteran Paul Rochester at right tackle they now form a cohesive unit . Biggs is a coming star , but as good as he is the Jets rate Philbin their steadiest defensive lineman. // Linebacking is looking up with the sharply improved play of 230-pound Al Atkinson , a Buffalo reject . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oklahoma recovers from his ankle injury next month . Larry Grantham is a shrewd , albeit small , operator on the right ; Ralph Baker returns on the left side . Either Yearby or Lammons might also be used . // New York 's defensive backs lack size , but Dainard Paulson is All-League at safety and Cornell Gordon could be good at right corner back . The right safety will be either Jim Hudson or Ray Abruzzese , and Billy Baird takes over from Willie West , gone to Miami in the expansion draft , at the other corner . Veteran Johnny Sample will add experience and speed to the secondary . A very swift but very small rookie , Sherman Lewis , the Michigan State star of three years ago , should make the team if only on punt and kickoff returns . // The kicking is strong with Punter Johnson , who averaged 45.3 yards ( second in the AFL ) , and Jim Turner , who scored 91 points with his toe . // That television musical in which the Jets lapsed into their old nonskills is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four games are against the lower echelon of the AFL  --  Miami , Denver and Boston  --  and they could be off to a fast start . Thereafter , the developing skills of the younger players could continue the momentum .
