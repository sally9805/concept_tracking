About the only thing in strike-bound Paris that seemed to be moving slower than the traffic last week was the peace parley on Viet Nam . U.S. and North Vietnamese negotiators held a single 2-hr. 57-min. session at the Hotel Majestic , then adjourned for four days . Hanoi was clearly bent on emulating the tactics of Fabius Cunctator ( the delayer ) , * the Roman general who wore down the more powerful Hannibal by his endless harassing tactics . The long break was occasioned in part , a Hanoi spokesman explained , by the fact that Ascension Day was approaching , " and since we translate ' ascension ' as ' escalation ' in Vietnamese , we had better not meet on that day . " <P> His comment was not entirely facetious . Hanoi doubled the rate of infiltration this year to at least 12,000 men a month , now has the equivalent of a dozen full divisions , or 80,000 men , in the South . If anything , fighting has intensified since talking began , particularly in northernmost I Corps . During the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 549 battle deaths , the second highest toll of the war . <P> In addition to Hanoi 's obvious desire to stall for time in hopes of strengthening its position on the battlefield , there are other reasons for the glacial pace of the talks . One is that the North Vietnamese clear even the most minuscule matters with Hanoi . They even had to exchange twelve cables before they were permitted to move from their expensive digs at the Hotel Lutetia to a 20-room suburban villa once occupied by the late French Communist boss Maurice Thorez . Hanoi hesitated out of fear : What would the Chinese Communists think of North Viet Nam 's delegates moving into a villa owned by the openly pro-Soviet French Communists ? <P> Another reason for delay may be that Hanoi hopes to take advantage of the U.S. presidential campaign to influence American policy and American public opinion . According to one theory current in Paris , the peace discussions will not achieve anything until the middle of August , after the Republican Convention and just before the Democratic Convention . The North Vietnamese do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less ; if there is progress in peace talks now , some of them suggest , they fear that Johnson will be drafted as the Democratic candidate , and they are anxious to keep that from happening . <P> Diminishing Returns . At one point , North Viet Nam 's negotiators avowed that if the U.S. unconditionally halted the bombing " and other acts of war " against the North , the talks could turn to " a political settlement of the Viet Nam problem . " That offer was soon followed by a threat . " In the event that these official conversations do not end in results , " warned Chief Negotiator Xuan Thuy , " the American party must bear the full and entire responsibility . "
