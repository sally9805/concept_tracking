YOU 'RE A BIG BOY NOW by David Benedictus. 187 pages . Dution. $3.95 . <P> <P> The pilgrimage from innocence to experience , or from the provinces to the city or from despair to salvation , is one of the more thoroughly traveled , heavily rutted highways of English fiction . John Bunyan drew up the road map-the Slough of Despond , the Valley of Humiliation , Doubting Castle-but British Novelist David Benedictus ' second book is far from Bunyanesque . At its zany best it is more reminiscent of the wonderfully erratic pilgrimage to London of young Sam Bennet in Dylan Thomas ' Adventures in the Skin Trade . <P> <P> Benedictus ' pilgrim is a bowlegged 22-year-old named Bernard Chanticleer who " lives by love but loves at random wherever his love will stick . " He lives with his parents in a London suburb , and agrees to go to work as a shoe salesman in the big London store where his father is a department manager . His parents provide him with a bowler , a pinstripe , suit that conceals his bowlegs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small " pied a terre " ( or , foot in the grave ) in Kensington . He learns the sales spiel handily enough ( " A beautiful shoe , madam , seamless uppers , a discreet buckle and a soft dimple toe , and for a foot like yours with so little adhesion between the phalanges of the toe and the metatarsal joint . . . " ) , but he is desperately unhappy . Bernard has no friends . He burns with hopeless , timid lusts . He lingers before the posters advertising " Running Without a Stitch , a documentary record of the nudists ' own Olympic games , filmed in all the glory of Cinemascope and Eastmancolour . " But he dares not enter the theater for fear of being seen . <P> Inevitably , he meets a kind-hearted doxy-a bit actress named Barbara Darling , who invites him into her bed and tries , unsuccessfully , to teach him a few rudimentary sexual tricks . Nevertheless , he spends a long , happy weekend with Barbara before losing her to a " doggish window dresser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bum , turn , dewlap , the lot . " <P> Novelist Benedictus , who had a solidly scandalous success with a first novel , The Fourth of June , about the seamier side of public-school life , unfolds his story with brevity and considerable wit . He has a fine comic flair for translating the mechanized absurdities of big-city life into visions of surrealist fantasy . But in the last chapters of You 're a Big Boy Now , his story loses its fine farcical edge , and he makes the fatal mistake of taking his hero seriously . He would have done well to keep in mind a famous aphorism observed by Evelyn Waugh : " Never apologize . Never explain . "
