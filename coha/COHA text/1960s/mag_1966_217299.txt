Red China 's Great Leap Forward , which began in 1958 , ground to a halt only three years later in a shambles of rusting backyard iron furnaces and neglected farms . The experiment set the nation back economically a full decade ; yet last week the Red Chinese seemed to be gathering strength for another leap . The length and direction of the stride were far from clear in the murky prose pouring out of Peking . What was clear was that Mao Tse-tung was rallying Red China 's 700 million people for another supreme effort of some sort , and behind it all was the full force of Peking 's 2,500,000-man army . <P> Everyone a Soldier . For months , Peking-watchers have been expecting a drastic social upheaval . Since November , China has writhed under a purge of " antiparty monsters " that has swept away many high-ranking party officials , journalists and artists . Peking propagandists have been praising Mao to the skies , whipping up much the same frenzied atmosphere as that preceding the 1958 leap . Mao himself added a mysterious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reappearing only in mid-May . <P> Last week an editorial in Peking 's People 's Daily explained that Mao had withdrawn from public view to " provide the scientific answer to the question of how to prevent the restoration of capitalism . " The answer : " Turn everyone into a soldier . " People 's Daily exhorted the army " to turn China 's factories , rural communities , schools , trading undertakings , service trades , and party and government organizations into great and truly revolutionary schools like the liberation army itself . " How the army would go about providing the schools has not yet been spelled out . Perhaps the army , with its highly developed political and counter-intelligence services , would provide cadres to swarm across China , carrying the Mao message . <P> Revolutionary Meals . The call to take on expanded tasks was not limited to the army . While the main job of workers remains in industry , Mao has called on them to study military affairs , culture and , whenever possible , engage in agricultural production . Though the peasants ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affairs , politics and culture and , if possible , " collectively run small plants . " In addition to being a teacher , the army can engage in farming and " run some small or medium-size factories . " <P> To spur the nation , Mao clearly wants to re-create the spirit of Yenan , where he and his followers in the 1930s holed up in caves and nurtured the revolution that was later to overrun the country . In Yenan , intellectuals served as peasants , peasants as workers , workers as soldiers . Mao 's great fear is that young Chinese who , in his words , " have never fought a war or seen an imperialist , " will fail to inherit the fiery revolutionary zeal that marked his early followers . <P> Mao is spreading his zeal in a particularly unpalatable way . In the past few months , the regime has been pushing a program to get the populace to eat an occasional " revolutionary meal " or " bitter-herb meal , " made up of unhusked rice , wild-grown vegetables and leaves-the type of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the Long March and the years in Yenan.
