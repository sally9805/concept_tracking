 | The Cults of " Research " and " Creativity " @# I F anyone attending a university today happens to mention to someone outside that he is engaged in research , the chances are that the immediate reaction will be " How wonderful ! " or at least " How interesting ! " Then possibly he may be asked what the research is about . By now this familiar dialogue no doubt sounds perfectly natural ; but a little reflection will suggest that it is , on the contrary , quite unnatural . Fifty , or even thirty years ago , the idea that doing research is in itself a wonderful or interesting thing was not the commonplace it has now become , nor would the question " Research into what ? " have then come as an afterthought or been overlooked altogether . To put it differently , the bare word " research " has in the last two decades become the symbol of an activity at once mysterious and sacred . And the popularization of the idea and of the practice has been accompanied by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ History contains no parallel to this extraordinary state of affairs ? unless it be the medieval attitude toward pilgrimages . In those times , I imagine , one who was impelled to save his soul by going to a distant shrine was seldom dissuaded . He would take off his shoes , pick up a stick , and go off with everyone 's blessing ? just as today he abandons his occupation , picks up a box of index cards , and is on his way with shining eyes , or a research grant , or both , amid general admiration . The very way in which we use the phrase " do research " implies that it is the act , not the goal , that matters ; and although few think of research as a pilgrimage for saving their souls , modern society does believe there is salvation in it . Research , one concludes , is no longer a neutral term descriptive of an activity that should be gauged exclusively by its fruits . Rather it has become a badge of honor , an excuse for the flight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lip service to liberal , enlightening , and philosophical learning , we find individual and general security only in the trappings of specialization . And this wholesale mania for research as a self-justifying activity , without regard to its need or its object , has produced a corresponding folly in our culture-at-large ? the no less deplorable cult of creativity . Creativity , which has come to be equated with happiness , is seen as the counterpart and complement of research , the complete article as against the fragmentary , the source of private pleasure as against the mere industry that is required for earning one 's daily bread . Together , these two oddly related purposes , research and creativity , encourage or excuse the repeated act of omission that is having an insidiously weakening effect on our entire intellectual life : the unwillingness to judge . For it is obvious to all that the righteousness of research is no longer confined to the academic world . Business respects the magic name fully as much . Let me quote from a recent newspaper advertisement which is headed like a news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Research . " In the body of the article we learn that " For many years , Lorillard research scientists have been experimenting in order to create a cigarette of such excellent taste quality that it would appeal to all smokers , yet with a lower tar and nicotine content than all other leading brands . In 1957 , the years of research were crowned by the development of the new Kent . " The drama that emerges from this report is , of course , patterned after what we have come to accept as the story of all scientific endeavors : an heroic struggle with nature yielding at last the secret and the power . But advertisers are not the only imitators of the scientific researchers . Corporations and public bodies carry on paperwork called research and help sustain the prestige to which the activity has risen . Research may be simply a search through documents ; it may be tabulating  | answers to questionnaires ; it may be interviewing strangers and combining their replies ; it may be mailing out three different styles of flyers and meditating on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest . Students in all branches of learning outside the physical sciences have also caught the spirit of titanic battle with the unknown , so that what used to be called Scholarship ( formerly regarded as a quiet and self-indulgent occupation ) is now Research , and it is deemed heroic and selfdedicated . In short , " finding out " defines research , regardless of the manner and occasion . The word has been so worn down by common use that people in doubt about a spelling tell you that they " did a little research in the dictionary . " CORRUPTION OF TEACHING T H I S confusion of ideas and purposes would be merely laughable if the endless praise of research had not deeply corrupted certain of our indispensable institutions . Perhaps the most important of these is the educational system . We have all become familiar with the frivolous make-believe indulged in by our lower schools under the pretense that children of ten can " do research , " in such forms as collecting travel folders and pasting them attractively in " research reports " about foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mania for research has become in the centers of higher learning , where it now produces symptoms of some gravity . I refer to the invidious system of academic promotion , the perversion of the undergraduate curriculum , and ( most recent ) the professional teacher 's contempt of teaching . These three are related to one another and to a rather vicious habit , which used to be absent from scholarship when the phrase " a gentleman and a scholar " still had meaning . The habit I have in mind is self-praise . Today , it is no longer forbidden to parade oneself as " a research scholar " and to look down on those fallen creatures who " do not publish " ; it is no longer improper for university . departments to boast of their greatness , due to So-and-so and So-and-so , mighty " pro-ducers " in the sight of men . A golden glow is diffused over an entire academic community from the individual halos earned by research . When one of these halos is extinguished by retirement or death or ? worst of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no peace of mind until a replacement is found . I should not have said " found , " but bought , for the way to build or recoup " strength " in the world of learning is to seduce a great scholar from his university and his teaching . He is offered a larger salary , the promise of immunity from students and other burdens , and the facilities of research , which means defraying the expense of travel , documents , and helpers . Why does research bring so much prestige in our century and why is it ? unlike the pilgrimage ? a collective rather than an individual merit ? The most likely answer is that we associate research with social benefits ? progress , increased production , new means of defense , better ways of coping with poverty , disease , and other common ills . In a democratic age , no greater good is recognized than that bestowed upon society , and society has learned to connect its comforts and happy surprises ? from penicillin to supermarkets ? with the frequently obscure or remote enterprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand not only the prestige but also the self-praise of the researcher . As a member of an inquisitive and demanding society of equals , he feels compelled to justify his existence and his work . He can find no surer way than to point to his chosen occupation . Even if his subject is pure humanistic scholarship , he is " in research " and can find admirers . Though only the little money of university advancement will reward his labors , this , coupled with the satisfactions of prestige , suffices to keep the system going and to multiply the products of research . Meanwhile , certain unpleasant side effects are noticeable . The requirement that every young college teacher shall " produce " is arousing discontent in young teachers and in their students , while tempting some in each group to a premature cynicism . " Neglect your teaching and you will rise ; attend to it and you will be fired . " Teaching continues to be honored on all pious occasions , such as commencement . In reality it is considered a fool 's way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system required one to be a great scholar , or a good scholar , or even a scholar at all : it only requires that one produce research , which being translated means publish papers . Their contents should be in a certain form and  | they should be documented and if possible accurate ? that is all . Thought , relevance to the interests of any other human being , engaging exposition or lucidity of prose are not mentioned among the specifications . The papers are merely asked for as evidence of professional discipline justifying one 's existence ? and promotion . And at the same time , " research " can be given as an excuse for neglecting the interests of students or of the university . The modern teacher flees to the library and cries " research " as the medieval thief fled to the church and cried " sanctuary ! " Thereafter both are untouchable by law or society . To equate scholarship with publication might he reasonable if the impulse to publish were spontaneous . If one is moved by curiosity and skilled in the act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell one 's peers what one has learned , for their edification and their criticism . But when filling a block of print is clone at regular intervals under tacit compulsion , and a judicious silence greets each successive teasing of the obvious or the trivial , - the idea of scholarship itself is compromised . Indeed , the cynicism and discontent of the young are justified , and the observer of the academic scene is at last brought to think that there may be something wrong with a system in which Lord Acton could never have become an assistant professor . Nor is this the worst effect of the potent principle . In the undergraduate college , which can not afford to have anything but active , fulltime teachers , the devouring ideal reappears in the form of the Honors program , which requires juniors and seniors to " do research " in the form of an " important paper " or a " senior thesis . " Those who take and those who teach this part of the curriculum are esteemed the happy few . To prepare or supervise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " whereas to teach or learn the fundamentals of great subjects is accounted an inferior task . In the overriding determination to share in the prestige of research it often happens that freshman-sophomore courses are taught as if every member of the class were to become a professional scholar in - the subject . This malpractice is not considered incompatible with the designation : liberal arts college . Looking upon these antics in a comic spirit , one is led to ask what whimsical or mad forces have been at work . The natural and legitimate bent of great talents toward specialization can not explain this universal passion for taking the pose of the researcher , aloof from the world and its cares , incubating the new knowledge which shall make us free . Visibly , a more common influence has entered the academy within the last twenty years and turned all the heads there . AN INFLUX OF . MONEY T H A T influence is undoubtedly money , which has come in sudden abundance from three sources ? the foundations , business , and government . Though with different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research . The foundations thought they could not discharge their obligation to society if they did not insist on the production of new knowledge . Their grants have gone chiefly to projects which otherwise could not have been undertaken or even conceived . Business at first offered its subsidies solely for studies of recognized commercial interest . But by now it too has begun to relish what is entirely novel . And government has divided its funds , largely for scientific purposes , between fundamental and immediate research . This distinction , desirable in itself , scarcely matters when compared with the transformation of university life . Under the threefold influence , academic men have been lifted out of the even tenor of their ways and made aware of tempting new prizes . The award of a grant is tantamount to a patent of nobility , coupled with a higher standard of living . In short , the influx of private and public funds for new enterprises has turned the university inside out like an umbrella in a storm , taking the holder by surprise and letting him see much that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fortune 's wheel , the great subsidies have academicized the non-academic world which provides the funds . This was inevitable . The results of the research enterprises necessarily take the " form of papers and reports , which have taught businessmen , civil servants , and foundation officials the tone and language of the academy . Yet this unexpected conquest of the world by the professors , and the insidious corruption of their conscience and judgment by the world , would not have been so rapid and complete if research at large had not been generally equated with scientific research . In nearly everyone 's mind , physical science has been the model that inspired and gave reassurance . Scientific research is unquestionably useful ; scientific research is solid and certain ; scientific research is never a waste . If the results of experimentation are negative , so much is gained for other workers ; if the facts ascertained @#  | are at the moment unconnected with any line of thought , they will nevertheless play their role at a later time . For science is gradually compiling the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our fate . The humanities and so-called social sciences have drawn on these points a literal analogy with science and relied upon it as if it were selfevident . Newness , certainty , applicability are their confident expectations from all the projects in educational research , opinion research , psychological and behavioral research , as well as from certain studies in literature and art , which range from measuring physical elements in paintings to counting images and themes in poems and novels . Almost alone , history has so far adhered to its traditional descriptive role . All this is taken as a matter of course , not to say as a sign of modern enlightenment . And yet within the last few years a kind of unease has overtaken the most able and thoughtful workers in this great mill which grinds ceaselessly day and night . The disquiet was voiced by a distinguished American scientist addressing the Fourth International Congress of Biochemistry : A unified and consistent vision of nature . has become impossible in our day , at any rate for working scientists . Ironically enough , the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the writers of science fiction . Each science protects itself from its neighbors by a cordon of slogans and catchwords ; and fashion dictates whether this year we are featuring enzymes or proteins or nucleic acids , and whether we wear the molecules long or short . New journals are born every day by Caesarean section performed by skillful publishers ; and as new disciplines are formed , so are new and mutually unintelligible languages ; a Tower of Babel made of paper . I T does not take much imagination to respond to this somewhat disenchanted view of the scientific adventure . But since at present no obvious steps suggest . themselves for checking its momentum and reversing its tendency , what does the newborn discontent produce in the culture at large ? Every strong feeling generates an act or a gesture to express it , and the new stance that I detect as the first sign of skepticism about the cult of research is its complement , the cult of creativity . What " creative " means in common usage is hardly clear ? it seems to correspond to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort , a synthesis of parts , while it also conveys , like " research , " the notion of something new and unexpectedly good . Some months ago , an article appeared in Coronet on " The Greatest Problem in Marriage " ? the word " problem " there betrays the scientific outlook ? and we could read how a couple had achieved the desired solution : " If they look out and see it is raining and decide to stay home and have fun reading , they have creativity , the highest state of good marriage adjustment . " Perhaps we are meant to infer that in popular speech creativity has come to mean knowing enough to stay out of the rain , but the word covers other purposes ? so many as to become a virtual synonym for happiness . What emerges is that creativity in the meaning of happiness suggests to the modern American the making of something expressive of his whole being ? something intimate and joyful and which does not have to be justified by its utility to others . It was inevitable that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by those who want to show that their workaday occupations are also capable of being transfigured . We find , for instance , that the behavioral scientists use the word creative to dignify the small innovations needed in business . They accordingly study what in one recent report , emanating from Ann Arbor , is called " Creativity and Conformity : a problem for organizations . " We are never told why conformity turns out to be the opposite of creation . But we note that academic committees in general are fond of applying to themselves the epithet " creative . " In the proposals for a Ph.D . program in economics at a respectable university , one finds under General Objectives this typical statement : " The program should be imaginative . It should stimulate creative , imaginative scholarship among participating students and faculty . Although traditional approaches can serve as its guides , we should be prepared to innovate . " The yearning here is not hard to understand .  | The desire is to have brilliant men make great discoveries and thereby produce an atmosphere of high intellectual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the repeated call for imagination as the source of this creativity and suddenly one perceives what all these people ? from the advertiser to the business manager and from the stay-at-home couple to the professor of economics ? really want . They want the blessedness of feeling like poets . Nor would they refuse to be known as poets , as artists , if at the same time they could share the credit and prestige of researchers , of scientists . We may say , then , that the professional man in our day , whether in academic life or outside , is hypnotized by two figures of commanding prestige ? the scientific investigator and the maker of works of art : Being neither , he wants to be both . To say this without qualification would suggest more disapproval than I intend . Many academicians , businessmen , and free-lance experts of all kinds are perfectly sincere in their attachment to the ideals of science and of art . They often understand the ways and appreciate the masterpieces of each . What is more , artists and men of science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have heard Nobel prize-winners in physics boast that their work is " creative " in the same sense as that of the poet , painter , or musician . And I have heard poets , painters , and musicians declare that their productions are born only after the most rigorous research into fundamental laws . But while I can recognize and can partly reproduce in myself the feelings that lead to such utterances , I confess to a still stronger feeling of impatience at what strikes me as childish boasts . Just as I see no reason why doing research should make one self-righteous and imbue others with a sense of awe-struck gratitude , so I see no reason why artists and scientists should all remind themselves of Leonardo da Vinci . The very popularity of that great man seems to me suspect : he is not so much admired for what he was as for what too many people think they are near to being . My general reason for objecting to the joint cult of research and creativity is that like most cults it is not sober @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very definition of the competent professional . Lack of sobriety is the great corrupter . Once again , I point to the situation in the academy , where so much of our intellectual life is reflected . Thanks to the cult of creativity , most colleges and universities now offer courses in creative writing . Students enjoy them , if only because the name has something liberating about it . But what is the result ? Another opportunity for avoiding the discipline of words and ? through words ? the responsibilities of feeling and thought . You may object that since the work is to be " creative , " it should indeed express any thoughts and feelings dear to the individual and in whatever form he chooses . Granted . The only question is whether that self-expression should be made easy , should be solicited and encouraged , instead of being forged and tempered by the application of resistance and criticism . The motives at work that are appealed to in " creativity " do not strike me as resembling those that have presided over the birth of genuine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course says in the campus paper about these motives : " If you want to write , write ! Only practice will bring excellence . Write for your own pleasure ; then , having written , try and see if some editor wo n't pay you for it . The chances are he wo n't , but you 're only out a few cents ' postage , some paper , and a number of hours spent in doing something you wanted to do anyway . It 's cheaper than drinking beer , and who knows ? You might hit the jackpot anyway . " FUN AND CASH F R 0 M this program , one enterprise at least may be seen for what it is ? a pastime , of which the by-product might conceivably be cash . As such , it is entirely acceptable . But to give it the name of creation is not acceptable . For with the one word creative we destroy the whole effort presumably made by the departments of English , fine arts , music , and history in trying to . explain to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Michelangelo miraculously performed with the common materials available to all men . That is properly creation . Creation is rare , sometimes difficult to do and always difficult to understand . And it follows that the inexpert aping of ordinary professional work , whether commercial or highbrow , bears no relation to the thing we dignify by comparing it with the act of a god . In the writing classes , then , creativity means , on the student 's part , evasion of standards of performance ; and on the instructor 's part , abdication of judgment . If the student were truly creative , no one would be capable of judging him , and certainly no one would like or approve what he did . If , contrariwise , the instructor keeps his hands off some ordinary or perverse  | production , he is shirking his duty . He seems to imply that existing standards must be waived when someone says , " Lo ! I am about to create ! " or again he implies that there is value and merit in repeating forms and ideas already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not be a goal in education , for it means that formal instruction is pointless . By the same token , creation is the opposite of research . This does not mean that research is necessarily pedestrian or lacking in opportunities to display ingenuity and original views . But ingenuity is a common talent that we should not confuse with genius ; and original views in research ? like what we mistakenly call imagination ? should be strictly subordinated to the evidence of facts . None of what is the proper business of the scholar , teacher , researcher , or student is creative . Am I then arguing about a word ? I do not think so ; but if I am , then I say the consequences of using that word are so grave as to justify the argument . For what I clearly see in the use of the word creativity is a device by which we give ourselves easy satisfactions while avoiding necessary judgments . That the faculty of judgment is at stake can be shown from a simple enumera-tion :  - -  Creative may mean the neglect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new writing , new painting , and new art generally .  - -  - Creative may falsely dignify certain ordinary virtues ? quickness of mind , sense of order and relevance and skill in using words ? all of which can be resumed under intelligence and intellectual training .  - -  Creative may suggest modern , fresh , or unshackled by convention or tradition . In that sense it can be used to justify waste of time , as when students analyze contemporary writers and attribute to them as innovations literary devices that are found in Homer and Virgil .  - -  Creative may also stand for a conscious or unconscious denial of the tremendous range of human ability . If a child in kindergarten is called creative for the finger-painting he produces , the distance between him and Rembrandt has somehow been shortened . Through a likening of potential and actual , a kind of democratic equality has been restored . And with this thought we are back at the position research occupies in our culture , and especially our academic culture . For we found that a good deal of research ? too much of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to satisfy requirements rather than one 's curiosity or that of other men . And it is a sense of the futility of these products that leads scholars , teachers , and researchers to sit up suddenly and call themselves creative . Here , then , are the two halves of one great act of omission we are all more or less guilty of : the unwillingness to judge that springs from our desire to maintain the democratic tone of life . If small talents are creative , then since everybody has them , everybody has a Leonardo-like mind . If research is to publish papers and nothing more , then we are all worthy and all safe ? in the name of creativity . Thou shalt not judge my research , and I swear I will not judge thine . Unfortunately , as a result of this agreement , we may come to think too little of ourselves . So we restore our spirits by murmuring , " Creative ! " To cry , " Hands off ! Creativity is going on ! " is the right of every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the duty of every academic man . And to make every man both academic and creative is the manifest goal of evolution . B U T what else , someone is sure to ask , are we to do ? As to any general , collective answer , I have none . But a particular , individual one seems to me obviously to follow from everything I have said : Let each man who is persuaded of the futilities I have tried to describe , rouse himself from his waking dream of magic by research and glory by creativity and let him get to work ? plain , solid , sober work . There is plenty to do ? teaching , not only some specialty , but the three R 's . In his specialty , let him organize and consolidate knowledge ; reflect and deduce principles . When opportunity permits or spontaneous curiosity dictates , then one may add his small bit of fact that is needed and that fits onto what we know , or yet again one may worthily keep the . public informed of these advances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned and laity . If even a few should do this faithfully , quietly , and with good judgment , they will earn the thanks of their contemporaries and posterity alike . And when a creative man , properly socalled , comes into our midst , perhaps our work will have prepared us for accepting his . We shall then not be made uncomfortable and hostile by his short cuts or other unprofessional ways , nor shall we hamper him in his work , because we shall know the distance that separates us and the need for every degree of excellence . And that too will be counted to our credit , as no amount of mechanical research and assumed creativity could possibly do . Harper 's Magazine , October 1960
