Kurtz said he sure would n't mind . Nor would any of them have minded , for that matter : one of the big events in the barracks was the arrival of what came to be known as " Mother Bassart 's goodies . " When Roy wrote and told his mother that she was the second most popular pinup girl in the barracks , after Jane Russell , she began to send two boxes of cookies in each package , one for Roy to keep for himself , and another for the boys who were his friends . As for Miss Jane Russell , her latest film had been banned by a court order from the movie house in Winnisaw , a fact which Alice Bassart hoped Roy would take to heart . That Roy read to Sergeant Hickey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the months , then , after his discharge , Roy made it his business first to catch up on his sleep , and second to catch up on his food . Every morning about quarter to ten  --  well after his father had disappeared for the day  --  he would come down in khakis and a T-shirt to a breakfast of two kinds of juice ,  |p51two  eggs , four slices of bacon , four slices of toast , a mound of Bing cherry preserves , a mound of marmalade , and coffee  --  which , just to shock his mother , who never had seen him take anything at breakfast but milk , he called " hot joe " or " hot java . " Some mornings he downed a whole pot of hot joe , and he could see that actually she did n't know whether to be scandalized by what he was drinking or thrilled by the amount . She liked to do her duty by him when it came to food , and since it did n't cost him anything , he let her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?

Are you drinking whiskey ? " " Oh , just a few snorts now and then , Alice . " " Roy  --  " Which was where  --  if he saw she was really taking it all in  --  he might come up , put his arms around her and say , " You 're a good kid , Alice , but do n't believe everything you hear . " And then he 'd give her a big , loud kiss on the forehead , sure it would instantly brighten not only her mood , but the whole morning of housework and shopping . And he was right  --  it usually did . After all was said and done , he and Alice had a good relationship . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then back into the kitchen for a quick glass of milk . Standing beside the refrigerator , he would drink it down in two long gulps , then close his eyes while the steely sensation of the cold cut him right through the bridge of the nose ; then from the breadbox a handful of Hydrox cookies , one of his oldest passions ; then " I 'm going , Mom ! " over the noise of the vacuum cleaner . . . In his first months back he took long walks all over town , and almost always wound up by the high school . It was hard to believe that only two years before , he had been one of those kids whose heads he would see turned down over their books , suffering . But it was almost as hard to believe that he wasn'tp52one of them too . One morning , just for the heck of it , he walked all the way up to the main door , right there by the flagpole , and listened to the voice of his old math teacher " Criss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window of 104 . Never again in Roy 's entire life  --  neverwouldhe have to walk up to the board and stand there with the chalk in his hand while old " Criss " gave him a problem to do in front of the entire class . To his surprise , the revelation made him very sad . And he had hated algebra . He had barely passed . When he had come home with a D his father had practically hit the ceiling . . . Boy , the things you can miss , he thought , if you 're a little crazy in the head , and strolled on , down through the ravine and out to the river , where he sat in the sun by the landing , separating Hydrox cookies , eating first the bare half , then the half to which the filling had adhered , and thinking , " Twenty . Twenty years old . Twenty-year-old Roy Bassart . " He watched the flow of the river and thought that the water was like time itself .

Sometimes even before noon he was overtaken with hunger , and he would stop off downtown at Dale 's Dairy Bar for a grilled cheese and bacon and tomato , and a glass of milk . At the PX in Adak they would n't make a grilled cheese and bacon and tomato sandwich . Do n't ask why , he once said to Uncle Julian . They just would n't do it . They had the cheese and the bacon and the tomato and the bread , but they just would n't put it all together on the grill , even if you told them how . You could talk yourself red in the face to the guy behind the counter , but he simply would n't do it . Well , that 's the old chicken s -- t Army , as he told Julian .

He had lost interest in the human head , and decided that rather than drive himself crazy trying to get a mouth to look like something that opened and closed , he would specialize in landscapes . He looked through hundreds of Holiday magazines  --  without much inspiration  --  though he did get to read about a lot of places and national customs of which he was totally ignorant , so it was n't time wasted  --  except when he fell asleep because the library as usual was so damn stuffy , and you actually had to make a requisition to get them to open a window and let some air in the place .

Close in like that he could hear the rough canvasy slap ! as the linemen came together  --  a sound he especially liked  --  and actually see those amazing granite legs of Tug Sigerson , which were said never to stop churning , even at the bottom of a pile-up . They would pull ten guys off him and there would be old Tug , still going for the extra inch , the inch that by the end of a game really could be the difference between victory and defeat . Or suddenly he would have to go scattering back with the little crowd of spectators , as one of the halfbacks came galloping straight at them , spraying chunks of dirt so high and so far that on his way home Roy sometimes found a little clump of the playing field in his hair . " Boy , " he 'd think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kid was movie ' . " The guy you especially wanted to watch up close , just for the beauty of it , was the big left end , Wild Bill Elliott . Wild Bill had spent three years faking the opposition out of theirp54pants , and was the highest-scoring end at Liberty Center since the days of Bud Brunn himself . In about one second flat he would fake the defense right , left , then cut left , buttonhook , take a Bobby Rackstraw bullet right in the belly , then  --  with just a shoulder  --  fake right again , only to turn and zoom straight down the center of the field  --  until Gardner Dorsey , the head coach , blew his whistle , and Bill came loping on back in that pigeon-toed way he had , tossing a long underhand spiral toward the line of scrimmage , and calling out , " Heads up , baby .

For the hour of the day , for the time of his life , for this America where it is all peacefully and naturally happening , he feels an emotion at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as love . One of the stars of the football team in the fall following Roy 's discharge from the Army was Joe " The Toe " Whet-p 55stone . He was a fleet-footed halfback ( he 'd done the hundred in 9.9 ) and the greatest place-kicker in the history of the high school  --  some said , the history of the state . Since the summer Joe had been dating Roy 's kid cousin Ellie , and on Saturday nights , while Julian and Roy were having a talk together , or a beer , Joe would come around to pick up Ellie and take her to what had become a weekly event for the Liberty Center Stallions , the victory party . He would sit with the two of them in the TV room while " The Princess Sowerby , " as Julian called her , decided what dress to wear . At first Roy did n't have too much to say to Joe . He had never really traveled with the athletes in high school , or with any gang , if he could help it ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered himself a little too much of an individualist for that . Not a loner , but an individualist , and there 's a big difference . But Joe Whetstone turned out to be nothing like Roy had imagined . You might have thought that with his reputation , and being so good-looking , he would turn out to be another one of those swell-headed wise guys ( like Wild Bill Elliott , who was big for spitting through his teeth into the aisle at the movies in Winnisaw , or so Roy had heard ) . But Joe was respectful and polite to the Sowerbys  --  and to Roy too . It took a while , but slowly Roy began to understand that the reason Joe sat there in his coat , nodding his head at whatever Roy might say , and himself saying hardly anything at all , was not because he was looking down his nose at him , but because he was actually looking up . Joe might be the greatest high school place-kicker in the history of the'state , but Roy had just come back from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sea from Russia itself . And Joe knew it . One Saturday night when Ellie came bounding down the stairs , Joe jumped to his feet , and Roy realized that the famous Joe " The Toe , " with six different scholarship offers already in his hip pocket , was really nothing more than what Ellie was  --  a seventeenyear-oldkid . And Roy was twenty , Roy was an ex-G.I .... Very shortly Roy began to hear himself on Saturday nightsp56saying things like " They sure gave you the rush act today , Joe , " or " How 's Bart 's ankle ? " or " How bad 's the rib going to be on the Guardello kid ? " Some nights now it was Ellie who had to do the waiting while the three men finished up discussingwhether Dorsey ought to have converted Sigerson from a tackle in the first place ; or whether Bobby ( Rackstraw ) was going to be too slight for college ball , bullet arm or no bullet arm ; or whether Wild Bill ought to go to Michigan ( which had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least he could be sure he was going to be with a coach who liked to move the old ball in the air . Those afternoons Roy went over to watch football practice he would almost always end up moseying over to the wooden bleachers back of the goal post so as to watch head-on as Joe placed his fifty through the uprights . " How you doin ' , Joe ? " " Oh , hi , Roy . " " How 's the old toe ? " " Oh , holding up , I guess . " " That a boy . " It was also down at this end of the field that the cheerleaders practiced . After Joe had finished up  --  " So long , Roy " ; " See you , kiddo "  --  Roy would button his field jacket , turn up the collar , lean back on his elbows , stretch his legs down across three rows of wooden stands , and with a little smile on his face , hang around a few minutes more watching the cheerleadersgo through their oh-so-imporant repertoire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " L , " Roy would say , in a soft mocking voice , not caring whether they heard or not . " Give me an I  --  Give me a B  --  " Throughout his four years of high school Roy had had a secret crush on Ginger Donnelly , who had become head cheer/leader when they were juniors . Whenever he saw her in the halls he would begin to perspire along his upper lip , just as he did in class when suddenly he found himself called upon to answer a question he had n't even heard the teacher ask . And the fact was that he and Ginger had never exchanged a word , and probably never would . However , she was built , as the saying goes , like a brick s. house , a fact Roy could n't seem to ignore , not that he always tried . In bed at night he would begin to think about the way she had of leaning back from the waist to do the Liberty Center locomotive , and he would get an erection ; at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cartwheels the length of the field , and everybody would be screaming and cheering , and Roy would be sitting there with an erection . And it was ridiculous , because she was n't that kind of girl at all . Nobody had ever even kissed her , supposedly , and besides , she was a Catholic , and Catholic girls would n't even let you put your arm around them in the movies until you were married , or at least engaged . Or so went one story . Another was that all you had to do was tell them you were going to marry them , right after graduation , and they " spread , " as the saying goes , on the very first date . Even where Ginger was concerned there had been stories . Almost every guy in Liberty Center would tell you that you could n't get near her with a ten-foot pole , and a lot of the girls said she was actually thinking about becoming a nun . But then this fellow named Mufliin , who was about twenty-five and used to hang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his friends over in Winnisaw told him that at a party across the river one night , back in Ginger 's freshman year ( before she 'd gotten so snooty ) , she had practically taken on the whole Winnisaw football team . The reason nobody knew about it was because the truth was immediately suppressed by the Catholic priest , who threatened to have all those involved thrown in jail for rape if even one of them opened his mouth . It was a typical Muffuin story , and yet some guys actually believed it  --  though Roy was n't one.  |p58Roy  's usual taste in girls ran to the ones who were a little more serious and sedate about things  --  Bev Collison , for instance , who had more or less been his private property during senior year , and was now a junior in elementary ed at the University of Minnesota ( where Roy thought he might decide to go at the last minute , if everything else fell through ) . Bev was one of the few girls around who did n't live her life as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would just as soon leave the showing off to the show-offs , and did n't go in for giggling and whispering and wasting whole evenings on the phone . She 'd had a straight B average , worked after school at the library , and still had time for extracurricular activities ( Spanish Club , Citizenship Club , The Liberty Bell advertisingmanager ) and a social life . She had her two feet on the ground ( even his parents agreed  --  bravo ! ) and he had always respected her a lot . Actually , it was because of this respect that he had never tried to make her go all the way . Still , it was the hottest and heaviest he had ever gone at it with anyone . In the beginning they used to kiss standing up in her front hallway ( for as long as an hour at a stretch , but all the time in their coats ) . Then one Saturday after a school dance Bev agreed to let him into the living room ; she took off her own coat and hung it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying he had to go in two minutes because her parents ' bedroom was directly over the sofa , toward which Roy was to stop trying to push her . It was several weeks more before he was finally able to convince her that he ought really to be allowed out of his coat , if only as a health measure ; and even then she did n't consent , so much as give up the fight , after Roy had already sort of slipped it half onto the floor , necking with her all the while so she would n't know . And then one night after a long bitter struggle , she suddenly began sobbing . Roy 's first thought was that he ought to get up and go home before Mr. Collison came down the stairs ; but he patted her a lot on the back and said everything was all right , and that he was really sorry , he had n't actually meant it ; and so Bev asked , sounding relieved , had n't he really ? and though he did n't know exactlyp59what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , never , no , " and so from then on , to his immense surprise , she was willing to let him put his hand wherever he wanted above the belt so long as it was outside her clothes . There followed a bad month during which Bev got so angry with him that they very nearly broke up ; meanwhile Roy was pushing and pulling and pleading and apologizing , all to no avail  --  until one night , fighting him off , Bev ( inadvertently , she tearfully contended later ) sank a fingernail so deep into his wrist that she drew blood . Afterward she felt so rotten about it that she let him put his hand inside her blouse , though not inside her slip . It so excited Roy that Bev had to whisper , " Roy ! My family  --  stop snorting like that ! " Then one night in Bev 's dark living room they turned on the radio , very , very low , and of all things , on " Rendezvous Highlights " they were playing the music from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Winnisaw . It was their movie , and " It Might As Well Be Spring " was their song  --  Roy had gotten Bev to agree . In fact , Roy 's mother said that he looked a little like Dick Haymes , though , as Bev commented , least of all when he tried to sing like him . Nevertheless , in the middle of " It 's A Grand Night For Singing " Bev just fell backward on the sofa with her eyes closed and her arms behind her neck . He wondered for a moment if it was really what she wanted , decided it must be , decided it had to be , and so , taking the chance of his life , drove his hand down between her slip and her brassiere . Unfortunately , in the newness and excitement of what she was letting him do , he caught the buckle of his watchband on the ribbing of her best sweater . When Bev saw what had happenedshe was heartsick , and then scared , and so they had to stop everything while she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , before her mother saw it in the morning and wanted an explanation . Then on the Saturday before graduationit happened ; in the pitch-black living room he got two fingers down onto her nipple . Bare . And the next thing he knew she was off visiting her married sister in Superior , and he was in the Army.  |p6oAs  soon as he was shipped to the Aleutians  --  even before the first shock of the place had worn off  --  he had written Bev asking her to get the University of Minnesota to send him an application form . When it arrived , he began to spend a little time each evening filling it out , but shortly thereafter it became evident to him that letters from Bev herself had just stopped coming . Fortunately by this time he was more adjusted to the bleakness of his surroundings than he had been on that first terrible night , and so was able to admit to himself that it had been pretty stupid to think of choosing a university because a girl he once knew happened to be a student @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been if after being discharged he had gone ahead and showed up in Minneapolis , to find that this girl had picked up with somebody new , neglecting however to tell him anything about it . So the application remained only partially completed , though it was still somewhere among " his papers , " all of which he planned to go through as soon as he could have two or three uninterrupted days so as to do the job right . The cheerleader Roy was sort of interested in was named Mary Littlefield , though everybody called her " Monkey , " he soon discovered . She was small and had dark bangs , and for a short girl she had a terrific figure ( which you really could n't say was the case with Beverly Collison , whom in his bitterness Roy had come to characterize , and not unjustly , as " flat as a board " ) . Monkey Littlefield was only a junior , which Roy figured was probably too young for him now ; and if it turned out that she did n't have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be curtains for little Monkey , even before the first date . What he was in the market for this time was somebody with a little maturity in her attitudes . But Monkey Littlefield did have this terrific figure , with these really terrifically developedmuscles in her legs , and that she was a big-shot cheerleaderdid n't faze him as it had with Ginger Donnelly two years before . What was a cheerleader , anyway , but a girl who was an extrovert ? Moreover , Monkey lived up in The Grove ,  |p61and  so she knew who Roy was : Ellie Sowerby 's cousin and a good friend of Joe Whetstone 's . He imagined that she knew he was an ex-G.I. simply because of his clothes . When she and her cohorts started in practicing their cartwheels , Roy would lace his fingers together behind his neck , cross one ankle over the other , and just have to shake his head ; " Oh , brother , " he would think , " they ought to know what it 's like up in the Aleutians . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would begin drifting off the field , their silver helmets swinging at their sides as they headed for the locker room . The cheerleaders would pick up their coats and schoolbooks from where they lay in piles on the first row of bleachers , and Roy would raise himself up to his full six feet three inches , stretch his arms way out and yawn so that anybody watching would just think of him as being more or less easygoing and unruffled . Then , taking one long leap to the ground , he 'd plunge his hands down into his pockets and start off toward home , maybe kicking high out with one foot , as though practicing his punt . . . and thinking that if he had a car of his own there would probably be nothing at all to saying to Monkey Littlefield , " I 'm going up to my cousin 's , if you want a lift . " Buying a car was something he had begun to give a lot of thought to recently , and not as a luxury item either . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had in high school , but the money Roy had saved in the service was his own , and he could spend it just as he liked . The family car had to be asked for days in advance and had to be back in the garage at a specific time every night ; only with a car of his own would he ever be truly independent . With a car of his own he might just give this Littlefield a run for her money  --  once he had made sure that she was n't just an extrovert and nothing else . . . And if she was ? Should that stop him ? Something about the muscles in her legs told Roy that Monkey Littlefield either had gone all the way already , or would , for an older guy who knew how to play his cards right.  | ... Up in the Aleutians it seemed that almost every guy in the barracks had gotten some girl to go all the way , except Roy . Since it did n't hurt anyone , and was n't so much a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself had gone all the way pretty regularly with this girl from the University of Minnesota . One night after lights out , Lingelbach , who really had the gift of gab , was saying that the trouble with most girls in the U.S.A. was that they thought sex was something obscene , when it was probably the most beautiful experience , physical or spiritual , that a person could ever have . And because it was dark , and he was lonely  --  and angry too  --  Roy had said yeah , that was why he had finally dumped this girl from the University of Minnesota , she thought sex was something to be ashamed of . " And you know something , " came a southern voice from the end of the barracks , " in later life those are the ones wind up being the worst whores . " Then Cuzka , from Los Angeles , whom Roy could n't stand , began to shoot his fat mouth off . To hear him talk , he knew every sex secret there ever was . All you have to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is to tell her you love her . You just keep saying it over and over and finally ( " I do n't care who they are , I do n't care if they 're Maria Montez " ) they ca n't resist . Tell them you love them and tell them to trust you . How do you think Errol Flynn does it ? asked Cuzka , who acted most of the time as though he had a direct pipeline to Hollywood . Just keep saying , " Trust me , baby , trust me , " and meanwhile start unzipping the old fly . Then Cuzka began to , tell how his brother , a mechanic in San Diego , had once banged this fifty-year-old whore with no teeth , and soon Roy felt pretty lousy about saying what he had out loud . Skinny and scared as Bev had been , she was really a good kid . How could she help it if her parents were strict ? The next day he was able partially to console himself over his betrayal by remembering that he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the conclusion that Roy ought to apprentice himself to a printer over in Winnisaw . His fatherp63liked to say the word " apprentice " just about as much as Roy hated to hear him say it . The knowledge of this aversion in his son did n't stop him , however : Roy ought to apprentice himself to a printer over in Winnisaw ; he knew his way around a print shop , and it was an honorable trade in which a man could make a decent living . He was sure that the Bigelow brothers could find a place for Roy  --  and not because he was Lloyd Bassart 's boy but because of the skills the young man actually possessed . Artists starve , as anyone knows , unless they happen to be Rembrandt , which he did n't think Roy was . As for enrolling in college , given Roy 's grades in high school , his father could not imagine him suddenly distinguishing himself at an institution of higher learning by his scholarly or intellectualabilities . Though Alice Bassart pointed out that stranger things had happened , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this instance . Lloyd Bassart was the printing teacher at the high school  --  not to mention the right arm of the principal , Donald " Bud " Brunn , the one-time all-American end from the University of Wisconsin . When the new consolidated high school had been built in Liberty Center in 1930 , people still had a picture in their minds of Don Brunn making those sensational end-zone catches over his shoulder during his four years in the Big Ten . What catching a football over your shoulder had to do with organizing a curriculum or estimating a budget was something that would remain incomprehensible to Alice Bassart until the day she died , but nevertheless , on the basis of that skill , Don , who had been teaching civics and coaching athletics down in a high school in Fort Kean , was offered the position in his old hometown . Being no fool , at least where his own interests were involved , he accepted . And so for eighteen years  --  eighteen solid years of midstream , as Alice expressed it whenever her anger caused her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( at least he sat in the principal 's office ) and Lloyd had been what Alice Bassart called " the unofficial unsung hero . " Don would n't so much as hire a new janitor without letting Lloyd take a look at him first , and yet Don got the salary of a principal , and was some kind of household godp64to parents in the community , while Lloyd , as far as the general public was concerned , was nobody . When Alice got off on this subject , Lloyd often found it necessary to quote what he said were the words of a man far wiser than either of them , the poet Bobbie Burns : " My worthy friend , ne'er grudge an ' carp , Tho ' Fortune use you hard an ' sharp . " He agreed that Don was a grinning nincompoop , but that was one of the facts of life he had learned to accept long ago . After this much time you certainly could n't go around all day hoping and praying that the fellow might see the light and resign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be any cause for him to resign . Nor could you wait for him to slip on a banana peel ; for one thing , Don was a healthy ox , destined to outlive them all , and for another , such an idea was beneath Alice even to think , let alone to say aloud . Either you could make your way through life with the bitter taste of envy always in your mouth , or you could remember that there are people in this world far worse off than yourself , and be thankfulthat you are who you are , and have what you have , and so on . Could Roy help it if he felt more like spending his evenings at Uncle Julian 's than at home ? Not that he considered Julian perfect by any means , but at least his uncle believed in having something of a good time in life , and all his ideas were n't about nvo centuries old . " Wake up ! " Roy wanted to shout into his father 's ear . " It 's 1948 ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see right off , even in something like his clothes . Whereas the big magazine in Roy 's house was Hygeia , Julian took Esquire every month , and followed their clothing tips from top to toe . He was maybe a little too loud with his color combinations , at least for Roy 's taste , but you had to admit he was right in the current style , whatever it happened to be . Even his opinion of Mr. Harry S Truman ( " half asshole and half Red " ) did n't keep him from having a collection of Harry Truman sport shirts that could knock your eye out . . . Atp65any rate , to appear in a public place without a tie was n't somethingJulian considered a scandal , nor did he act as though life on this planet was coming to an end if Roy showed up at the house with his shirttail accidentally hanging out . That Roy was n't going to get all worked up over things that were only " externals " was something Uncle Julian seemed capable of understanding . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his nephew in the evenings , " look who 's here , Irene  --  Joe Slob . " But smiling ; not like Roy 's father , whom all through the Army his son had remembered most vividly as he used to see him coming out of Mr. Brunn 's office  --  gray hair combed slick , mouth shut , tall and straight as an arrow  --  and wearing that damn gray denim apron , like the town cobbler . After he had come home from World War II , Julian had sat down to figure out what people needed that would be cheap and helpful to them and profitable to himself : he had come up with the idea of the laundromat . So simple , and yet within a year the quarters and half dollars that the ladies in the towns along the river dropped into the washers and driers of the El-ene Laundromatic Company left Julian twenty thousand dollars to himself . Now , Roy had no particular desire to follow in the footsteps of a businessman ; it was not only personal considerations that caused him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; there was a matter of principle involved . Roy did n't know if he still believed the way he used to in free enterprise , at least as practiced in this country . During his last few months up in the Aleutians , Roy had listened from his sack when some of the college graduates in his barracks had their serious discussions at night about world affairs . He himself did n't say much then and there , but often on the following day he would find occasion , while sitting around the motor-pool office where he was supply clerk , to talk over some of the things he had heard with Sergeant Hickey . To be sure , he did n't swallow everything this Lingelbachsaid that was critical of America . Sergeant Hickey was perfectly right : anybody could make destructive criticisms ,  |p66anybody  could just go ahead and start knocking things left and right all day long ; to Sergeant Hickey 's way of thinking , if you did n't have something constructive to say , then maybe you should n't say anything at all , especially if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chow and drawing the pay check of the country you thought was so terrible and awful . Roy agreed that Sergeant Hickey was perfectly right : there were some guys in the world who would never be satisfied , even if you fed them all day long with a silver spoon , but still you had to give this guy from Boston ( not Lingelbach , who was an outright loner and odd-ball , but Bellwood ) a lot of credit for his arguments about the way they did things in Sweden . Roy agreed right down the line with Sergeant Hickey and his Uncle Julian about Communism , but as Bellwoodsaid , Socialism was as different from Communism as day from night . And Sweden was n't even that socialistic . What had made Roy begin to wonder if after his discharge a person like himself might not be happy living in a place like Sweden was ( i ) they had a high standard of living , and it was a real democracy with the Four Freedoms ; but ( 2 ) they were n't money-mad , Bellwood said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't a criticism , it was a fact ) ; and ( 3 ) they did n't believe in war , which Roy did n't believe in either . Actually , if he had n't just returned from sixteen months in the Aleutians , he might have gone off and gotten himself a job as a deckhand aboard a freighter bound for Sweden , and once there , found some kind of good , honest work , and not in Stockholm either , but in some fishing village such as he had seen photographs of in Holiday . He might even have settled down there and married a Swedish girl , and had Swedish children , and never have returned to the United States again . Would n't that be something ? To think , if that was what he wanted , he could pick up and do it , and without explaining himself to anyone . . . However , for the time being he 'd really had his fill of the sun coming up at ten A.M. and going down practically at noon , and the rest of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Swedes themselves  --  becausesomething did . Sergeant Hickey , who saw all the magazines before they were put in the day room , came into the office one morning and announced that in the new issue of Look it said that more people jump off of buildings in Sweden than in any out-and-out capitalistic country in the world . When Woy later brought this up with Bellwood , he did n't really have much to say in Sweden 's defense , except to start quibbling over percentages . Apparently there was a heck of a lot of gloom over there that Bellwood had n't mentioned , and very frankly , for all Roy 's willingness to sympathize with their form of government so long as it was a democracy with free elections , by and large he would prefer at the end of a day 's work to spend his leisure time with people who knew how to relax and take it easy . Moderation in all things , that was his motto . Consequently , he found that he would just as soon spend his evenings at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either had to keep the radio at a whisper because his father was upstairs writing some report for Mr. Brunn , or else his father was downstairs and they were discussing something called Roy 's Future as though it were a body he had found on the front lawn : now look here , Roy , what do you intend to do with it ? As for Lloyd Bassart 's disapproval of Roy 's nightly social call over to the Sowerbys ' ( and of his brother-in-law Julian as an influence and confidant ) , he disguised his real objections by saying that he did n't feel Roy should make himself a permanentfixture in another family 's house simply because they had a television set . Roy said why should his father mind if the Sowerbys themselves did n't ? Uncle Julian was interested in what the postwar Army was like , and in what the younger generation was thinking , and so he liked to talk to Roy . What was so wrong with that ? However , the " talks " between Julian and Roy consisted , as frequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Julian got a kick out of kidding Roy , and Roy got sort of a kick out ofp68being kidded , since it really put them on a buddy relationship . Of course , sometimes Julian went too far with his kidding , particularly the night Roy had said he really did n't think he could ever be satisfied as a human being unless he was doing something creative . As it happened , he was only repeating something he had once heard Bellwood say , but it applied equally as well to him , even though he had n't thought it up personally . Uncle Julian , however , chose deliberately to miss the point , and said it sounded to him as though what Roy needed was a good piece . Roy had laughed it off and tried to act nonchalant , even though his Aunt Irene was in the dining room , where she could hear every word they said . Julian 's sense of humor was n't always up Roy 's alley . It was one thing if you were in the barracks , or the motor-pool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and another when there were women around . Where Uncle Julian 's language was concerned , Roy felt his father had his strongest case . And then sometimes Julian got his goat with his opinions on art , which were totally uninformed . It was n't the security angle he wanted Roy to think about before going off to some la-dee-da art school ; it was the sissy angle . " Since when did you become a lollipop , Roy ? Is that what you were doing up there in the North Pole , turning pansy on the taxpayers ' money ? " But by and large the kidding was good-natured , and the arguments they had did n't last very long . Though Uncle Julian was just a couple of inches over five feet , he had been an infantry officer during the war , and had nearly had his left ball shot off more times than he could count . And even though he said it just that way , regardless of the age or sex of anyone listening , you had to admire him , because it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Nuts ! " to the enemy had gotten all the publicity at the time , but apparently Julian had been known throughout the 36th Division as " Up Yours " Sowerby ; more than once that was the message he had shouted back to the Germans , when another man would have withdrawnor even surrendered . He had risen to the rank of major and been awarded a Silver Star ; even Lloyd Bassart took hisp69hat off to him on that score , and had invited him to address the student body of the high school when he returned from the war . Roy remembered it yet : Uncle Julian had used hell and damn twelve times in the first five minutes ( according to a count kept by Lloyd Bassart ) , but fortunately thereafter simmered down , and when he was finished , the students had risen to their feet and sung " As the Caissons Go Rolling Along " in his honor . Julian called Roy " you long drink of water , " and " you big lug , " and " Slats , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sometimes his nephew had no sooner stepped into the foyer than Julian had his fists up and was dancing back into the living room , saying , " Come on , come on , Slugger  --  try and land one . " Roy , who had learned in gym class how to throw a one-two punch ( though he had not yet had occasion to use it in the outside world ) , would come after Julian , open-handed , leading with his right , while Uncle Julian would bob and weave , cuffing aside the one before Roy could deliver the two . Roy would circle and circle , looking in vain for his opening , and then  --  it never failed to happen  --  Julian would cock back his right arm , cry " Ya ! " and even as Roy was ducking his chin behind his fists and hiding his belly back of his elbows ( just as he had been taught in high school ) , Julian would already be swinging one leg around sideways to give his nephew a quick soft boot in the behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Slim , " he 'd say , " sit down , take a load off your mind . " But the best thing about Julian was n't his happy-go-lucky manner : it was that his experience in the Army made him appreciate how hard it was for an ex-G.I. to adjust back to civilian life at the drop of a hat . Roy 's father had been too young for World War I and too old for World War II , and so the whole business of being a veteran was just one more aspect of modern life that he could n't get into his head . That a person 's values might have changed after two years of military service did n't seem to mean anything to him . That a person might actually benefit from a breather in which he got a chance to talk over some of what he had learned , to digest it ,  |p70did  n't strike him as anything but a waste of precious time . He really made Roy 's blood boil . Julian , on the other hand , was willing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but there was a little differencebetween somebody making a suggestion and somebody giving you an order . So all through that fall and into the winter , Julian listened , and then one evening in March , while he and Roy were smoking cigars and watching the Milton Berle Show , Roy suddenly began during the commercial to say that he was starting to think that maybe his father was right , that all this valuable time was just slipping through his fingers , like water itself . " For crying out loud , " Julian said , " what are you , a hun-dred ? " " But that is n't the point , Uncle Julian . " " Come on , get off your own back , will you ? " " But my life  --  " " Life ? You 're twenty years old . You 're a twenty-year-old kid . Twenty , Long John  --  and it wo n't last forever . For Christ 's sake , live it up a little , have a good time , get off your own back . I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next day Roy finally did it ; he hitched over to Winnisaw and bought a two-tone , second-hand I946 Hudson.  |p71From  between the curtains in her bedroom , Ellie Sowerby and her friend Lucy watched him begin to take it apart and put it together again . Every once in a while he would stop and sit up on the fender , with his knees to his chest , swinging a Coke bottle back and forth in front of his eves . " The war hero is thinking about his future , " Eleanor would say , and the very idea caused her to snort out loud . Roy , however , appeared to pay no attention to either of them , even when Eleanor rapped on the window and ducked away . As the weather grew warmer , he would sometimes be seen slouched down in the back of the Hudson , his legs thrown up over the front seat , reading a book he had taken out of the library . Ellie would call out the window , " Roy , where in Sweden are you going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a loud slam of the rear door of the car . " Roy 's reading all about Sweden . Half the farmers around here came running from there . He wants to go there . " " Really ? " asked Lucy . She did not take offense , because her own grandfather who had been a farmer had come from Norway . " Well , I hope he goes somewhere , " Ellie said . " My father 's worried he 's liable to decide to move in with us . He practicallyp72lives here as it is . " Then , out the window , " Roy , your mother phoned to say she 's selling your bed . " But by this time he was under the car , the soles of his shoes all that was visible from the second floor . The only time that he appeared to experience the girls as alive was down in the living room , when he would n't move his legs so much as half an inch , and the two had to step over him to get out through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though teams had been chosen , himself and his Uncle Julian on one , and the two girls and Mrs. Sowerby on the other . But if there were such sides , Lucy Nelson had no sense that Irene Sowerby was on hers . Though Mrs. Sowerby was polite and hospitable to her face , Lucy was almost certain that behind her back the woman disapproved of who and what she was . The very first time Ellie had brought her home , Mrs. Sowerby had called Lucy " dear " right off the bat ; and a week later Ellie was no longer her friend . She disappeared from her life as unexpectedlyas she had come into it , and the person responsible was Irene Sowerby , Lucy was sure . Because of what she knew about Lucy 's family , or because of whatever she had heard about Lucy herself , Mrs. Sowerby had decided that she was not the kind of girl she wanted Ellie bringing home in the afternoons . That was in September of senior year . In February ( as if four months of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't intervened ) Ellie slid a note , all cheery and intimate , into Lucy 's locker , and after school they were walkingtogether up to The Grove . Of course Lucy should have left her own note in return : " No , thank you . You may be insensitive to the feelings of others but you are not going to be insensitive to mine and get away with it . I am not nothing , Ellie , whether your mother thinks so or not . " Or perhaps she should not have given Ellie the courtesy of any reply , and just let her show up at the flagpole at three-thirty to find no Lucy waiting breathlessly to be her idea of a " friend . " She felt bitter toward Eleanor , not only because she had picked her up so enthusiastically and dropped her so suddenly , but because Ellie 's instantaneous display of affection hadp73caused Lucy to make a decision she would n't otherwise have made , and which later she was to regret . But that was not really Eleanor 's fault as much as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to believe as she reread the note scrawled across the blue stationery monogrammed EES at the top ) . The reason she should have nothing to do with Ellie Sowerby was because she was Ellie 's superior in every way imaginable , except for looks , which she did n't care that much about ; and money , which meant nothing ; and clothes ; and boys . But just as she had known Ellie to be her inferior , and had gone off with her when invited back for a second afternoon in September , so in the last week of February she followed along once again . Where else was there to go ? Home ? As of February 28 she had only two hundred more days to live in that house with those people ( times twenty-four is four thousand eight hundredhours  --  sixteen hundred of them in bed , however ) and then she would be down in the new Fort Kean branch of the women 's state college . She had applied for one of the fifteen full honors scholarships available to in-state students , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all was an honor , she had been awarded only what the letter of congratulation called " A Living Aid Scholarship , " covering the yearly dorm bill of one hundred and eighty dollars . She would be graduating twenty-ninth in a class of one hundred and seventeen , and now she wished that she had worked and slaved for A 's in those courses like Latin and physics , where she had felt it a real victory to get even a B-minus . Not that financial difficulties were going to prevent her going off to school . Over the years her mother had somehow managed to save two thousand dollars for Lucy 's education ; this , plus Lucy 's own eleven hundred dollars in savings , plus the Living Aid Scholarship , would see her through four years , provided she continued to work full time at the Dairy Bar in the summers and was careful about spending on extras . What disappointed her was that she had wanted to go off completely independent of them ; as of September , 1949 , she had hoped to have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herp74life . The previous summer she had settled upon Fort Kean State College because it was the least expensive good school she could find , and the one where she had her strongest chance to get financial assistance ; she had declined to apply anywhere else , even after her mother had revealed the existence of her secret " college fund . " Why Lucy detested taking the money was not only because it would continue to bind her to home , but because she knew how it had been paid out to her mother , and she knew why too . Almost into the fifth grade she had thought it made her rather special to be the daughter of Mrs. Nelson , the piano teacher ; then , all at once , the kids waiting on the porch in warm weather or sitting on their coats in the hallway in winter , were her own classmates  --  and that fact caused her to be filled with a kind of dread . No matter how fast she ran home from school , no matter how silently she tried to make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already at the piano , invariably a boy , who invariably would turn his head away from his lesson in time to catch sight of his classmate , Lucy Nelson , scooting up the stairs to her room . At school she came to be known not as the kid whose mother gives the piano lessons but the kid whose father hangs around Earl 's Dugout  --  of that she was sure , though the divisionshe now sensed between herself and her schoolmates was such that it did not permit her to ask what they actually thought , or to learn what it was they really did say behind her back . She pretended , of course , that hers was a normal household , even after she had begun to realize it was not  --  even after her mother 's pupils went back out into town to spread the story of what Lucy Nelson 's family was really like . Of course , when she was small , she was nearly able to believe it when she told her friends that it was actually her grandparents who lived with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Right off she told new friends that why she could n't bring anyone home in the afternoon was because her grandmother , whom she loved dearly , had to take her nap then . And she had new friends often . There was a period whenp75every girl her age who moved to town heard from Lucy about her grandmother 's nap . But then a new girl named Mary Beckley ( whose family moved on again the following year ) began to giggle at the story , and Lucy knew that somebody had already cornered Mary Beckley and told her Lucy 's secrets . This so angered Lucy that tears came popping out of her eyes , and that so frightened Mary that she swore on her life that she 'd giggled only because her baby sister took naps too ... Only , Lucy did n't believe her . And from then on she refusedever to tell a lie again , to anyone about anything ; from then on she brought no one to her home , and did not offer explanations for her behavior either . So , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was her confidante , nobody she cared about ever saw her mother taking from her students the little envelopes of money ( and saying , " Thank you very much , " so very , very sweetly ) , or what was far worse , the dread of dreads , saw her father coming through the front door and falling down drunk in the hall . Not even Kitty Egan , whom she discovered in her second year of high school , and who for four months was as intimate a companion as Lucy had ever had . Kitty did n't go to Liberty Center High , but to the parish school of St. Mary 's . Lucy had just started working four nights a week at the Dairy Bar , and she met Kitty because of the scandal : Kitty 's older sister , Babs , who was only seventeen , had run away from home . She had n't even waited until Friday , when the girls at the Dairy Bar were paid , but had taken flight after work on a rainy Tuesday night , probably still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy who swept up at the packing company and came from Selkirk . A post card addressed to " The Slaves at Dale 's Dairy Bar " and mailed from Aurora , Illinois , had arrived in town at the end of the week . " Headed for West Virginia . Keep up the good work , KIDS . " And signed , " Mrs. Homer Babs ' Cook . " Kitty was sent around to the Dairy Bar by her father to pick up Babs ' wages for Monday and Tuesday . She was a tall ,  |p76skinny  girl whose most striking feature was the absence of any complexion ; she had no more coloring than the inside of a potato , even when she came in out of the cold . At first she seemed as unlike Babs as she could be , until Lucy learned that Babs had dyed her hair black so as to look like Linda Darnell ( it had originally been orange like Kitty 's ) ; as for her skin , Babs caked it in so much mud , Kitty said , you would never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had always had their troubles with Babs . The only satisfaction she gave them was to wear crucifix earrings in her pierced ears and a cross around her neck , and that , Kitty said , was only to draw attention to the space between her breasts  --  which was the only real thing there anyway , the space . The breasts were things like toilet paper or her brother Francis ' socks that she stuffed into her brassiere . Babs was n't five minutes away from St. Mary 's  --  a dark brick building just by the Winnisaw Bridge  --  when she would duck into some alleyway to cover herself with pancake make-up , from the roots of her dyed hair to the tops of her homemade breasts , all the while puffing a Lucky Strike cigarette . Kitty told Lucy about the terrible thing she had once found in her sister 's purse  --  " Then I found this terrible thing once in her purse "  --  and when Babs discovered that Kitty had flushed it down the toilet , she screamed and yelled and struck her in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  for fear that her parents would severely punish her older sister , who , she said , needed mercy and forgiveness and love . Babs was a sinner and knew not what she was doing , and Kitty loved her , and every morning and every night she prayed for her sister living down there in West Virginia with a boy who Kitty believed was not even her husband . There were three more children at home , all younger than Kitty , and she prayed for them too , especially for Francis Jr. , who was soon to have an operation for his " mastoidistis . " The Egans lived out near the Maurer Dairy Farm , where Mr. Egan worked , in a house that was nothing more than a dilapidated old shack . There were nails poking out of the timbers , and flypaper dangling , though it was already fall , and every un/painted two-by-four seemed to have its decoration of exposed wire . Lucy , upon entering , was afraid to move for fear of brushing up against something that would cause her to feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeingthe place where Kitty had to eat and sleep and do her homework . And when Kitty said that in the afternoons her mother had to take a nap , Lucy was afraid to ask why , knowing that behind such a lie there could only be some dreadful truth she did not want to hear ; she wanted only to get outside into the air , and so , thinking that the door nearest her led to the yard , she pushed against it . In a tiny room , asleep on a double bed , lay a pale woman in a long gray cotton slip , wearing on her left foot  --  in bed !  --  a crippled person 's shoe . Then she was introduced to Francis Jr. , who instantly showed her the spot where he appeared to have been whacked with a stick behind the ear . And Joseph , aged eight , whom Kitty had to take into the house to change out of his overalls , which were  --  " as usual , " Kitty said  --  soaking wet . And tiny Bing  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blanket around and around the backyard , crying for someone named Fay , who Kitty said did n't even exist . And then Mr. Egan appeared , whom Lucy might even have liked for his big lumbering stride and his blazing green eyes had not Kitty earlier pointed to something hanging from a nail in the rear of an open shed , which she whispered was a cat-o ' - nine- tails . In all , it was the most wretched and unhappy family Lucy had ever seen , heard of , or imagined ; if possible , it was worse even than her own . She and Kitty began to meet regularly after school . Lucy , standing in the park across the street from St. Mary 's , would watch the Catholic kids rushing out the side doors and imagine them all going back to houses just like Kitty Egan 's , even though the old Snyders , who were Catholics and lived three doors down on Franklin Street , owned a house almost exactly like her Daddy Will 's . Lucy told Kitty her secret . They walked down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe distance she pointed outp78the door to Earl 's Dugout of Buddies . Kitty whispered , " Is he there now ? " " No . He 's working . At least he is supposed to be . He goes there at night . " " Every single night ? " " Almost . " " Are there women ? " " No . Whiskey . " " Are you sure there are no women ? " " Well , no , " Lucy said . " Oh , it 's awful . It 's horrible . I hate it ! " It did n't take very long for Kitty to tell Lucy about Saint Teresa of Lisieux , the Little Flower  --  Saint Teresa , who once said , " It is for us to console Our Lord , not for him to be consoling us . . . " Kitty had a little book with a blue cover called The Story of a Soul , in which Saint Teresa herself had written down all the wonderful things she had ever thought or said . Even though the weather had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late afternoon , the two girls would sit on a bench in the little park across from St. Mary 's , huddled close together in their coats , while Kitty read to Lucy passages that she said would change her whole life , and get her into heaven for all eternity . In the beginning Lucy could not seem to get the hang of it . She listened attentively , sometimes with her eyes closed so as to concentrate better , but soon it began to seem that not being a Catholic , she was fated never to understand whatever it was that so inspired Kitty . She herself was Lutheran on one side and Presbyterian on the other , and the latter had been her church , back when her mother had been able to get her to go . A kind of melancholy about her spiritual stupidity slowly settled upon her , until one day , despising both herself and her narrow Protestant background , she looked over Kitty 's shoulderat a page of the mysterious book , and discovered that it was n't hard to understand at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  who suddenly seemed to her so hopelessly , so disgustingly , ignorant  --  substituted " a " for " the " and " he " for " she " and " what " for " when , " and left out entirely those words she could n't pronounce , or changed them into others . Still , Kitty loved Saint Teresa as Lucy had never loved anything , at least that she could remember ; and so , gradually , when she began to get the drift of Saint Teresa 's meaning , and saw again and again how it flooded Kitty with joy to pronounce aloud those very words , nearly all of which Saint Teresa herself had written , she began to wonder if perhaps she should n't forgive Kitty Egan her reading problem and try to love Saint Teresa too . It was Kitty who brought her to meet Father Damrosch . She began to take instruction from him for an hour after school two days a week , and to spend still other hours in the church , lighting endless candles to Saint Teresa , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own . At her first retreat she was given a black veil to keep by Sister Angelica of the Passion , a dark little woman with shiny skin and rimless spectacles and hair beneath her nose that so resembled a man 's mustache that Lucy said nothing of it for fear of offending Kitty , who adored Sister Angelica and did n't even seem to notice the long black hairs . Kitty had told Sister Angelica about Lucy in a letter , and so the sister knew all about Lucy 's father , for whom she had already prayed at Kitty 's request . Sister Angelica was also praying for Babs in West Virginia . In vain , however , did they all wait for news from the vanished sinner . It was as though she had stepped directly from that restaurant in Aurora , Illinois , into Hell itself . Kitty and Lucy would read aloud to each other their favorite passages from Saint Teresa , who had left this fallen world at twenty-four , a gruesome death of weakness , cold , coughing and blood . " ... to become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Kitty read , " always seek when is best , and forgot oneselfish ... ' " They both chose what Sister Angelica called " Saint Teresa 's little way of spiritual childhood . " Teresa 's only care , said Sister Angelica to Lucy , was that no person should ever bep80distressed or even inconvenienced by what she was enduring ; " daily she sought opportunities for humiliating herself " ( Sister Angelica read this to Lucy from a book , so it was not just something she was making up )  --  " for instance , by allowing herself to be unjustly rebuked . She forced herself to appear serene , and always courteous , and to let no word of complaint escape her , to exercise charity in secret , and to make selfdenialthe rule of her life . " The doctor who attended Teresa in her final illness had said , " Never have I seen anybody suffer so intensely with such an expression of supernatural joy . " And her last words , in the slow agony of her dying , were , " My God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a life of submission , humility , silence and suffering ; until the night her father pulled down the shade and up-ended the pan of water in which her mother was soaking her beautiful , frail feet . After calling upon Saint Teresa of Lisieux and Our Lord  --  and getting no reply  --  she called the police . Father Damrosch did not choose to call upon her himself when she ( who usually attended at least two ) failed to show up at a single Mass that Sunday , nor when she did not appear the following week for her instruction . Instead he apparently arranged for Kitty to be excused early from school one day so as to meet Lucy outside the high school , which recessed each afternoon thirty minutes before St. Mary 's . Kitty said that Father Damrosch knew about Lucy 's father spending the night in jail . Kitty said that this was only another reason for her to hurry and be converted . She was sure that if Lucy asked , Father Damrosch would see her an extra hour a week , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her first Communion within a month . " Jesus will forgiveyou , Lucy , " Kitty said , whereupon Lucy turned in anger and said that she did not see that she had anything for which to be forgiven . Kitty begged and begged , and finally when Lucy told her , " Stop following me ! You do n't know anything ! " Kitty began to weep and said she was going top81write Sister Angelica so that she too would pray for Lucy to embrace the teachings of the Church before it was too late . She feared for a while that she would run into Father Damrosch downtown . He was a big burly man , with a mop of black hair , who liked to kick the soccer ball around with the Catholic boys after school . His voice and his looks made girls who were even Protestant swoon openly in the street . He and Lucy had had such serious discussions , during which she had tried so hard to believe the things he said . " This life is not our real life , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... How had he found out so quickly what had happened ? How did everybody know ? At school , kids she hardly recogizedhad begun to say , " Hi , " as though it had been discovered she were dying of some dread disease and everybody had been told to be nice in the few weeks remaining to her . And after school a group of hideous boys who hung out smoking back of the billboard shouted after her , " Hey , Gang Busters ! " and then imitated a machine gun firing . After they had kept at it for a whole week , she picked up a stone one afternoon , turned suddenly around , and threw it so hard that it left a dark mark where it struck against the billboard . But the boys only continued to jeer at her from where they had fled into a vacant lot . At home she continued to insist upon eating by herself in the kitchen , rather than with him , whom her grandfather had gone down and taken out of jail the very next morning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking angrily at her food , she prayed that it would be Father Damrosch . What would her grandmother do when the priest announced himself ? But he never did . She even thought of going directly to him  --  not to ask his help or his advice , but because she recognized one of the boys who called her " Gang Busters " from seeing him at nine o'clock Mass with his family every Sunday . However , she would let Father Damrosch know right off , she had nothing to be forgiven for and nothing to confess . Who was Kitty Egan even to suggest such a thing ? A homely , backward girl from an illiterate family , whose clothes smelledp82like fried potatoes and who could n't read a sentence from a book without getting it all balled up ! Who was she to tell Lucy anything ? And as for Saint Teresa , that Little Flower , the truth was , Lucy could n't stand her suffering little guts . She gathered together her black veil , her rosary , her catechism , her copy of Story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the retreat and from the vestibule at St. Mary 's , and put them into a brown paper bag . What prevented her from simply dropping the items separately into the bottom of her wastebasket was the knowledge that her grandmother would see them there , and think that it was because of her objections to " all that Catholic hocus-pocus " that Lucy was giving up going into the Church . She did not wish her to have the satisfaction . What she decided to do about her religion , or about anything relating to her personal life , was the business of nobody in that house , least of all that snoop . She carried the paper bag with her to work that night , intending to drop it into a garbage can along the way , or toss it into a lot . But a rosary ? a veil ? a crucifix ? Suppose the bag was found and brought to Father Damrosch ? What would he think then ? Perhaps the only reason he had refrained from calling her so far was because he felt it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to conversion ; or perhaps he believed it improper to meddle in a private matter before his assistance had been asked for ; or perhaps he had sensed all along that Lucy only half believed the things he told her and so would be immune to anything further he might have to say ; or perhaps he had never really been that interested in her to begin with , thought of her as just another kid , and if she came to him , would only resume stuffing her full of catechism so as finally to stuff her into the confessional , where , like stupid Kitty Egan , she could ask forgiveness for sins that were not really her own and say prayers for people that did them absolutely no good . He would try to teach her to learn to love to suffer . But she hated suffering as much as she hated those who made her suffer , and she always would . After work she hurried out Broadway toward the river . Atp83St . Mary 's she entered without genuflecting , placed the bag on the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one light on in the rectory . . . Was Father Damrosch standing behind one of the dark windows , looking down at her ? She gave him a moment to call for her to come inside . And tell her what ? This life is a prelude to the next ? She did n't believe it . There is no next life . This is what there is , Father Damrosch . This ! Now ! And they are not going to ruin it for me ! I will not let them ! I am their superior in every single way ! People can call me all the names they want  --  I do n't care ! I have nothing to confess , because I am right and they are wrong and . I will not be de-stroyed ! One night two weeks later Father Damrosch came into Dale 's Dairy Bar for a black and white ice cream soda . Dale popped immediately out from the back to say hello , and to serve the priest personally , saying all the while what a great honor it was . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the father insisted , and when he left , one of the waitresses said to Lucy , " He 's absolutely gorgeous . " But Lucy only continued carefully refilling the sugar bowls . The very next term Lucy took the music appreciation course , where she was prevailed upon by the teacher , Mr. Valerio , to become interested in the snare drum ; so for the next year and a half the problem of what to do after school was solved by band . Either they were practicing in the auditorium , or on the field , or on Saturdays were off and away to a football game . There were always kids dashing in and out of bandroom , or shoving from behind onto the bus , or jamming together , epaulet to epaulet , in the band section , to stay warm while the game itself  --  which Lucy hated  --  wore interminably on . As a result , she was hardly ever alone around school to be pointed out as the kid who had done this or that terrible thing . Sometimes as she was rushing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she would see Arthur Muffin slinkingaround the basketball courts , or perched on his motorcycle , smoking . He had been thrown out of Winnisaw Highp84years ago , and was some kind of hero to the boys who used to call her " Gang Busters " and " J. Edgar Hoover . " But if he himself had any smart remarks to make she did n't wait to hear them . She would just start in practicing the marching cadence and continue all the way to the field , beating it out so loud that whether he called to her or not , she did n't even know . But then , altogether unexpectedly , at the very start of her senior year , band was over . She had cut practice twice in two weeks to go up with Ellie Sowerby to The Grove ; to Mr. Valerio she explained ( her first lie in years ) that her grandmother was ill and needed her  --  and he had swallowed it . So there was no tension between them at all ; she was still his " dream girl . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field at the start of the afternoon , guiding her line , " Left .. . left . . . left , right , left , " and drumming out the muffled cadence till they reached the midfield stripe and launched into the National Anthem . It was the moment of the week she had come to live for , but not because of anything so ridiculous as school spirit  --  or even love of country , which she supposed she had , though no more than an ordinary person . It was n't the flag , snapping in the breeze , that gave her the gooseflesh so much as the sight of everybody in the stands rising as it moved down the field . She saw from the corner of her eye the arms sweep up , the hats swept off , and felt the drum thumpthumpingsoftly against the guard on her leg , and the warmth of the sun fell on her hair where it poked out from under her black and silver hat with the yellow plume and oh , it was truly glorious  --  until that third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stripe to face the stands ( where everyone was silently standing facing them ) and she tightened her hold on the smooth sticks , and Mr. Valerio climbed onto the folding chair that had been brought out to the field for him , and he looked down at them  --  " Band , " he whispered , smiling , " good afternoon "  --  and then in the moment before he raised his baton , she realized ( for no good reason at all ) that in the entire Liberty Center Consolidated High School MarchingBand , there were only four girls : Eva Petersen , whop85played the clarinet and had a wall-eye ; the harp-bell player , Marilynne Elliott , whose brother was a big hero , but who herself stammered ; and the new French-horn player of whom Mr. Valerio was so proud , poor Leola Krapp , who had that name and was only fourteen and already weighed two hundred pounds  --  " stripped , " the boys said . And Lucy . On Monday she told Mr. Valerio that working in Dale 's Dairy Bar at night and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time enough to study . " But we finish by four-thirty . " " Still , " she said , looking away . " But you managedlast year , Lucy . And on the honor roll . " " I know . I 'm really sorry , Mr. Valerio . " " Well , Lucy , " he said , " you and Bobby Witty are my mainstays . I do n't really know what to say . The big games are just coming up . " " I know , Mr. Valerio , but I think I have to . I think I better . College is coming up too , you know . And so I really have to knuckle down and make an all-out effort  --  for my scholarship . And I have to make the money at the Dairy Bar . If I could quit that , of course , then I could have this . . . but I just ca n't . " " Well , " he said , loweringthe lids of his big black eyes , " I do n't know what 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I hate even to think about it . " " I think Bobby can carry them , Mr. Valerio , " she said , feebly . " Well , " he sighed , " I 'm not Fritz Reiner . I suppose this is what they mean by a high school band . " " I 'm really sorry , Mr. Valerio . " " It 's just I do n't often get a person , boy or girl , who is serious about the snare drum the way you are . Most of them , if you 'll pardon my language , just beat the damn thing to death . You listen . You 've been my dream girl , Lucy . " " Thank you , Mr. Valerio . I really appreciate that . That means a lot to me . I sincerely mean that . " Then she laid on his desk the box in which she had folded up her uniform . The silver hat with the black peak and the gold plume she carried in her hand . " I 'm really sorry , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his desk . " My drums , " she said , weakeningby the moment , " are in bandroom . " Mr. Valerio sat there flicking the plume on her hat with one finger . Oh , he was such a nice man . He was a bachelor with ap86slight limp who had come to them all the way from a music school in Indianapolis , Indiana , and his whole life was band . He was so patient , and so dedicated ; he was either smiling or sad , but never angry , never mean , and now she was letting him down , and for a selfish , stupid , unimportant reason . " Well , so long , Mr. Valerio . Oh , I 'll stop by and say hello , and see how things are going  --  do n't worry about that . " Suddenly he took a very deep breath and stood up . He seemed to have collected himself . He took one of her hands in his two and shook it , trying to look happy . " Well , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tears rolled down her cheeks ; she wanted to kiss him . Why was she doing this ? Band was her second home . Her first home . " But , " Mr. Valerio was saying , " I suppose we are all going to survive . " He clapped her on the shoulder . " You take care now , Lucy . " " Oh , you take care , Mr. Valerio ! " A little girl with braids was sitting in the swing on the porch when Lucy came running up the front stairs . " Hi ! " the child said . Whoever was already at the piano stopped in the middle of a bar as she slammed the door and took the stairs , two at a time . As she turned the key in the bedroom door she heard the piano start up again downstairs . Instantly she pulled out her desk chair , stood up on it , and looked at her legs in the mirror over the dresser . They had hardly any shape ; she was just too short and too skinny . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been five one and a half now for two years , and as for weight , she did n't like to eat , at least not at home . Besides , if she got any heavier her legs would just get round , like sausages  --  that 's what happened to short girls . She climbed down off the chair . She looked at herself straight on in the mirror . Her face was so square  --  and boring . The word " pug " had been invented to describe her nose . Eva Petersen had tried to give her that as a nickname in the hand , but Lucy had told her to cut it out , which she did instantly ,  |p87what  with her own wall-eye . A pug nose was n't that bad , actually , except that where hers turned up at the end it was too thick . And so was her jaw , for a girl at any rate . Her hair was a kind of yellowish-white , and she knew that bangs did n't help all that squareness any , but when she lifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forehead was so bony . Well , at least her eyes were nice  --  or would have been had they belonged to someone else , though that was the trouble : they did belong to someone else . Sometimes she used to look at the mirror in the bandroom , and with her hat on she would be terrified by the resemblance she bore to her father  --  particularly those two round blue stains beneath the steep pale brow . She had freckles too , but no pimples  --  her only physical blessing . She stepped backward so as to see all of herself again . All she ever wore was that plaid skirt with the big safety pin in front , and her gray sweater with the sleeves pushed up , and her ratty loafers . She had three other skirts , but they were even older . And she did n't care about clothes . Why should she ? Oh , why had she quit band ? She clutched at the back of her blouse so that it pulled tight across her front . Her breasts had started growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year later , they had just stopped . But were n't they going to start again ? She did know an exercise that supposedly could enlarge them . The health teacher , Miss Fichter , had demonstrated it to them in class . It was out of American Posture Monthly , a magazine with a picture on the cover of little twin boys in white briefs , standing on their heads and smiling . There was nothing there to cause giggling , as far as Miss Fichter could see , and that went for the exercise as well , whose purpose was all-around health and attractiveness . If only they got into the habit of exercising their muscles when they were young , they would always be proud of themselves physically . Too many teen-age girls in this school slouch , said Miss Fichter , and she said it as though she really meant lie or steal . You did the exercise with your hands out in front of yourp88chest : first you pushed the right fist into the open left palm , and then the left fist into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each time chanting in rhythm , as Miss Fichter did , " I must , I must , I must respect my bust . " In front of her mirror , behind the locked door , and without the words , Lucy gave it a try . How long before it began to work ? " Da dum , " she said , " da dum . . . da-dum , da-dum , da-dum . " Oh , how she would miss band ! How she would miss Mr. Valerio ! But she simply could n't march any more with those girls  --  they were freaks . And she was n't ! And nobody was going to say she was either ! From now on it would just be her and Eleanor Sowerby together . In Ellie 's room was a bed with a white organdy canopy and a dressing table with a mirror top , where they would do their homework on the afternoons when it rained ; on nice afternoons they would sit out in the back , reading together in the sun , or just walk around The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If by the time they got hack it was dark , most likely the Sowerbys would invite her to join them for supper . On Sundays they would ask her to come with them to church , and stay on afterward for dinner . Mrs. Sowerby was so soft-spoken and attentive , she had called her " dear " the very afternoon they were introduced  --  to which Lucy had nearly , idiotically , responded with a curtsy . And Mr. Sowerby had come noisily into the house at five  --  " Pappy Yokum 's home ! " he 'd called , and then had given his wife a loud wet kiss right on the mouth , even though she was a plump woman with gray hair who , Ellie said , had to wear rubber stockings to keep her veins in . It was Ellie 's current joke to call him Pappy Yokum , and his to call her Daisy Mae , and silly as this struck her , Lucy had nonethelessfound herself very much in awe of what appeared at last to be a happy family . So she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hi there , " Ellie would say as they passed in the corridors , and then just keep walking . For a week Lucy was able to tell herself that Ellie was only waiting for her to return the invitation . But howp89could she invite her home if she did n't even get a chance to talk to her ? And even if she was able to , did she want to ? One day , after two solid weeks of being ignored , she saw Ellie sitting in the cafeteria at the same table with some of the shallowest and silliest girls in the entire school , and so she thought to herself , well , if those are the kind of girls she really prefers , et cetera , et cetera . Then in late February she found the note slipped down through the air vents into her locker . Hi , Stranger ! I 've been accepted at Northwestern ( big deal ) so the pressure is off , and I can relax now . Meet me at the flagpole at threethirty ( please please ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 49 Northwestern ' 53 ( ! ) This time Lucy was far less impressionable . Thinking back to September , to the sheer idiocy of quitting band so as to be Ellie Sowerby 's friend  --  well , it was as though she had been ten years old . She had really gone against every principle she had . It had been weak and stupid and childish , and though in the interim she had despised Ellie , and plenty , she had despisedherself no less . For one thing , it was a matter of absolute indifference to her who lived in The Grove  --  that was the truth . Nothing used to infuriate her more than to take a drive with her family on Sunday ( back when she was young enough to have to go where they wanted her to ) and have her mother point out the house up in The Grove that her father had once almost bought . As if where you lived or how much money you had was what was important , and not the kind of human being you were . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and enough money to send a daughter off to a place like Northwestern for four years , but the fact remained that Lucy Nelson was still more of a person than their own daughter would ever be.  |p90To  Ellie the biggest thing in life was clothes . Outside of Marshall 's store in Winnisaw , Lucy had never seen so many skirts in one place as Ellie had hanging in her big wall-length closet with the sliding doors . Some afternoons , when it rained and they studied together in Ellie 's room ( exactly as she had imagined they would ) , she looked up to discover the closet doors ajar ; whole minutes often passed before she was looking down into her book again , trying to find her place . When the weather began to turn warm and by three o'clock it was suddenly too hot for the coat that Lucy had worn to school that morning , Ellie would tell her just to pull any old sweater out of the bureau drawer and wear it for the rest of the afternoon . Only there were n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she put on turned out to be one hundred percent cashmere . She did n't realize this until out on the lawn , she took a quick look at the label and went breathless at what she had done . By this time , however , Ellie was calling for her to help pound in the croquet wickets , and Mrs. Sowerby had already seen her pass through the living room . And she had already seen the look of disapproval move across Mrs. Sowerhv 's face , at the first glimpse of the sagging plaid skirt coming down the stairs topped by Ellie 's lemoncoloredsweater . " Have a good game , " Mrs. Sowerby had said , but that , Lucy realized too late , was n't at all what she had been thinking . To go back upstairs , however , to change the cashmere for cotton , or even lamb 's wool , would be to admit that she was indeed guilty of choosing it deliberately , when in actuality she had taken it in all innocence . Upon lifting it from the overstuffed drawer she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It had nothing to do with being covetousand she would not give credence to any such suspicion by traipsing all the way past Mrs. Sowerby a second time . She had no intention of ever being made to feel inferior again , not by Ellie , and not by any member of her family . . . and that was the reason she gave herself for keeping the soft lemon-colored sweater on her back until the very minute that she changed back into her heavy winter coat and left for home.  |p91Shortly  thereafter Ellie trimmed her bangs for her . Lucy kept saying , " Not too much . Really . My forehead , Ellie . " " What a difference ! " Ellie said when they looked at the results in the bathroom mirror . " I can see you now . " " You took too much off . " " I did n't . Look at your eyes . " " What 's wrong with them ? " " They look great . They 're really a great color if you could ever see them . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it up ? Let 's see what it looks like up . " " My head 's too square . " " Let 's just see , Lucy . " " Do n't cut anything . " " I wo n't , jerk . I just want to see . " So , too , Ellie just wanted to see what Lucy 's plaid skirt would look like if they let down the hem three inches to give it " The New Look . " It seemed so silly to be allowing this to happen to her , so incredible that it was happening . She did n't even respect Ellie , so where did she get off treating Lucy like her stooge ? And she did n't respect Ellie 's parents that much any more either . What was Mrs. Sowerby but a social snob ? As for Mr. Sowerby  --  well , she had n't figured him out yet . Daddy Will liked to crack corny jokes , and her father used to think he was being funny when she was small and he called her " Goosie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was almost always loud . Whenever he was down in the living room , Lucy took her time going between Ellie 's bedroom and the bathroom at the end of the hall . " Pike this , " he 'd call to his wife in the kitchen . " Just pike this ! " And then at the top of his voice he would read from the newspaper something that Harry Truman had done which just infuriated him . Once he called , " Irene , come here , Irene , " and when she came into the living room , he put a hand on her behind and said ( softly now , but Lucy , frozen in the upper hallway , could hear by holding herp92breath ) , " How 's the health , tootsie ? " How could she approve of the way he talked to Mrs. Sowerby , or the kind of language he used ? She certainly did n't believe that Mrs. Sowerby did , what with all her airs . She had the distinct feeling that all this hugging and kissing was something Mrs. Sowerby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry for her . On the other hand , Mr. Sowerby was Liberty Center 's outstandingwar hero . On his return to town the Mayor had actually led a motorcade down to the train station to meet him . Lucy had only been a freshman when he came to the high school to talk , but she remembered that his speech had left a sobering impression on the people in the community who had thought the worst was now over . His topic had been , " How to Make This World a Better Place to Live In "  --  or , as some of the boys referred to it afterward , " How the Hell to Make This God Damn World a Helluva Better Place to Live In  --  Damn It ! " It was mostly about remaining vigilant in the coming years against what Mr. Sowerby called the threat of atheistical Communism . The very next day there had been an editorial on the front page of the Winnisaw Leader calling upon Major Sowerby to run for Congress in the 1946 elections . Ellie said that he had decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have been right to take Ellie out of her school once again , if they had had to move to Washington , D.C. Because of the war she had already had to attend schools in North Carolinaand Georgia ( which , said Ellie , accounted for her sometimesfalling into a southern accent without even realizing it ) . Ellie loved to tell how the Governor had spoken to her father on the phone , and how her father had said he did n't want the Governor to think he was putting responsibility to family above responsibility to country , and so on and so forth . The conversation came out different each time Ellie reported it ; once it even occurred at the Governor 's " mansion . " Only the tone in which the story was told remained the same : smug . Of course Lucy appreciated Ellie 's generosity with her possessions , and it was hard to say she was n't good-natured , but one thing that was unforgivable was being condescended to . Thep93day that Ellie began to fuss with her clothes she got so furious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she would have too , were it not that Ellie had already unstitched the hem and was busy pinning up a new one , and she herself was in her slip and blouse , sitting at Ellie 's dressing table and looking out between the curtains at Ellie 's cousin , the Army veteran , working on his Hudson . Roy . She had never called him that , or anything . And he did not appear even to know her name , or even to associate her with the girl who worked behind the counter at Dale 's Dairy Bar . Between September , when she had caught her first glimpse of him at Eleanor 's , and February , when grace had fallen upon her a second time , she had observed him many times as he sat at the counter of the Dairy Bar ; sometimes she had seen him headed down Broadway carrying his sketch pad . During those months without band and without Ellie , when she used to hole herself up every afternoon in the public library , there was a period of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the library just as she was going in . He was friendly with Dale , and once she 'd seen him talking seriously with Miss Bruckner , the librarian . So it was n't shyness that explained his solitude ; he just seemed to prefer to be alone  --  which was one of the things that had begun to make her think that he might be an interesting person . Also she knew who his father was  --  Mr. Bassart , who introduced the speakers at assembly programs , and was known to be one of the strictest though one of the fairest teachers in the entire school . And she knew he had recently returned from serving two years in the Army , overseas . Ellie always made fun of him . " He thinks he looks like Dick Haymes . Do you think he does ? " " I do n't know . " " If he was n't my cousin I suppose I 'd think he was cute . But I know him , " she would add ominously . Then , out the window : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lucy never heard your imitations . Do Vaughan Monroe , Roy . You reallyp94look more like him anyway , now that you 're so mature . Sing Ballerina , ' Roy . Sing , There , I 've Said It Again . ' Oh , please , Roy , please , we beg of you on bended knee . " Lucy would go scarlet , and Roy would make a sour face , or say something like , " Act your age , will you ? " or , " Really , Ellie , when are you going to grow up ? " Roy was going to be twenty-one . What he was doing the times she saw him meandering slowly down Broadway , whackinghis sketch pad against his thigh , or on the evenings when he sat at the Dairy Bar counter , rattling the ice round and round at the bottom of his Coke , or on the weekends he spent sunk down into the club chair talking with his Uncle Julian , was trying to decide just what to do with his life . He was at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard him using one Saturday . And it had stayed with her . What was Roy going to become ? An artist ? A businessman ? Or was he going to ship out , and really give Sweden a chance ? Or would he do something completely bizarre and unpredictable ? Once she heard him remind his uncle that he did n't only have the G.I. Bill , he had a G.I. home loan too . If he wanted to , he could actually go off and buy a house of his own , and then live in it . His Uncle Julian laughed , but Roy said , " Poopoomy ideas all you want , kiddo , but it 's true . I do n't have to be anybody 's slave , not if I do n't want to be . " From the bed where she was sitting hemming Lucy 's skirt , Ellie said , " What are you looking at ? " Lucy dropped the edge of the curtain . " Not Roy , I hope , " Ellie said . " I was just looking outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't waste your breath on that one , " said Ellie , biting the thread . " You know who he likes ? " " Who ? " " Monkey Littlefield . " To Lucy 's astonishment her heart made some sort of erratic movement . " Roy 's major interest these days is s-e-x . Well , he 's picked the right girl , all right . "  | " Who ? " " Littlefield . " " ... Does he take her out ? " " He 's still deciding whether to lower himself or not . Or so he says . He said to me , Is she a kid , or has she got a brain in her head ? Otherwise I do n't want to waste my time . ' I said , Do n't worry , Roy . She 's no kid . ' So he said , What is that supposed to mean ? ' And I said , I know why you like her , Roy . ' And he got all red in the face . I mean , everybody knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lucy pretended by her expression that she did . Ellie went on . " I said , It is n't her personality that makes her popular , Roy . ' So he said , Well , that 's all I asked , Ellie , whether she even had a personality or not . ' Well , ask Bill Elliott about her personality , Roy , if you have n't already . ' So he said , I did n't even know she went out with him . ' Not any more , Roy . Even he does n't respect her any more . I 'll leave the rest to your imagination , ' I said , and then you know what he said ? ' Go play with your jacks , Ellie . ' He tells my father all his big sex exploits in the Army , and Daddy lets him , which he should n't , either . You know when they start laughing down there together ? " " No . I do n't think so . " " Well , they do . And what do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " He 's got it on the brain . Roy , I mean , " Ellie added . By April the elastic at the top of Roy 's Army socks had begun to unravel . Every time the two girls stepped over him  --  " Excuse us , cousin , will you , please ? " said Eleanor  --  Lucy saw , between the shrunken , fading khaki trousers and the drooping socks , the white and slender part of his leg . At the beginning of the month , a week of hot , wonderful , summery weather swept across the Middle West , pushing into bloom almost overnightthe forsythia in the Sowerby garden ; one afternoon , just as she stepped to Ellie 's bedroom window to take a quick look outside  --  at the new flowers  --  Roy began pulling his T-shirt offp96over his head . In only a matter of seconds she had turned back to Ellie , who was searching a drawer for an old pair of shorts for Lucy to wear , but the sight of his long smooth cylindrical upper half stretching down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all afternoon . Near the end of the month , when Roy bought the camera and began to get the photography magazines , he came to Eleanor and said that he wanted to do some studies in black and white down by the landing . He needed a girl to sit under the tree he 'd picked out . It might just as well be Ellie . Ellie 's color rose ; she had auburn hair that shone , and hazel eyes that changed sometimes to cat-gray , and in repose she was not only one of the prettiest girls Lucy had ever seen , but also looked altogether poised and intelligent . She could easily have passed for nineteen or twenty , and she knew it . " Look , Roy , " she said , dropping into her southern accent , " why do n't you-all get Monkey Littlefield ? Probably she 'll even do cheesecake fo ' ya ' . A la Jane Russell  --  yo ' favorite actress . " " Look , " he said , making his sour face , " I do n't even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen a Jane Russell movie in my life , actually . " " Oh , I 'm shoo-wa of that . You only had her little of pinup all over your walls in the Army , but you never seen her in a movie . " " Look , Ellie , who are you supposed to be , Gone With the Wind ? I want to do this study . So say either yes or no . I have n't got all day . " Ellie said she 'd think about it , and then went up and changed into her new white linen dress , all the while telling Lucy about the kind of letters her Aunt Alice had gotten while Roy was in the Army . S-e-x , to his own family . They drove off to the river . Lucy came along for the ride . That was how Roy had extended the invitation , when she said that she 'd better go home . " You can come for the ride , if you want . I do n't charge anything "  --  all the while using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air in a front tire that he said looked to him to be low.  |p97He  posed his subject ( because that 's all she was , and he hoped she could understand what that meant ) by the big oak near the old pier . Ellie kept wanting to look off in profile toward Winnisaw , but Roy wanted her looking straight up into the tree . Every few shots or so he came over and yanked on one of the branches so as to get the shadows to fall in the right places . Ellie said she would like to know what he meant by " the right places . " " I 'm talking technically , Eleanor . Will you shut up ? " " Well , it 's hard to know these days , Roy , when you say the right places . ' Considering where your mind is . " " Oh , look at the branches , please ? The whole idea , Ellie , is The Marvel of Spring . So look up , and not at me . " " I hear you at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Laughing . And I know what you 're laughing about too . " " Okay , what ? " " Guess . " At the end of the afternoon Ellie said , " Why do n't you take some of my friend ? " He sighed deeply . " Oh  --  okay . One . " He turned all around . " Well , where 'd she disappear to ? I have n't got all day . " Ellie pointed to the bank of the river where the black pilingsjutted out into the water . " Hey , " Roy called , " want your picture taken ? I 've got to leave , so if you want it , let 's go . " Lucy looked up . " No , " she said . " Lucy , come on , " Eleanor called . " He needs one of a blonde . " Roy had to slap his own forehead . " Who said that ? " he wanted to know . " She likes you , " Ellie whispered . " Now who told you that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lucy stood at attention under the tree , looking straight at the hole in the camera , and he took a picture . One . She noticed that he did not refer to the light meter first. p 98When the picture was developed , he showed it to her . She was heading down the Sowerby drive for home when he came out of the house behind her . " Hey . " Despite herself , she turned . He trotted down the drive in a kind of loping , pigeon-toed run . " Here , " he said . " You want it ? " She had hardly taken the picture from his hand when he added , " Otherwise I 'm going to throw it away . It 's not too hot . " Glaring at him she said , " Just who do you think you 're talking to , you ! " and thrust the photograph at his chest and walked angrily home . That evening he appeared at Dale 's Dairy Bar , where she worked on Mondays , Tuesdays and Wednesdays from seven to ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He sat where she had to take his order : a grilled cheese with bacon and tomato . When she put down the sandwich in front of him , he said , " Hey , about this afternoon "  --  he took a bite out of the sandwich  --  " I'msorry . " She went on about her business . When finally she came back to ask if he would care for anything more , he said it again , as sincerely as he could , and this time without a mouthful of food . " Pay the cashier , " she answered , giving him his check . " I know that . " She had been watching him , however , for months ; he was always so busy thinking about himself that he usually left the money on the counter . " You never do it , " she answered sharply , and started away , realizing that she had said the wrong thing . Sure enough , he followed her down the counter . What a smile . From ear to ear . " Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " What time do you get off work ? " " Never . " " Look , I really am sorry . I meant the picture was no good . Technically . "  | " Pay the cashier , please . " " Look , I 'm really genuinely sorry . Look ... I do n't lie , " he said when she did not respond . " I do n't have to , " he said , hitchingup his trousers . He was parked outside at closing time . She refused to accept a lift home . She did not even acknowledge the offer . " Hey , " he said , driving slowly along beside her , " I 'm only trying to be nice . " She turned off Broadway , up Franklin , and the car turned with her . After proceeding in this way for another block , he said , " Well , no kidding , what 's wrong with trying to be nice ? " " Look , you , " she said , and her heart was beating as though some terrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said again , " leave me alone ! " And from then on , he was unable to . He took hundreds of pictures of her . Once they spent a whole afternoon driving around the countryside in search of the right barn for her to stand in front of . He wanted one with a falling roof and a gloomy air , and all they could find were big red ones freshly painted . Once he made her stand in front of a white cement wall by the high school , in the full noon light , so that her bangs looked like white straw , and her blue eyes like the eyes in a statue , and the hones of her square serious face appeared to he stone beneath her skin . He entitled the photograph " Angel . " He began a whole series of black and white studies of Lucy 's head , which he called " Aspects of an Angel . " At first he had to tell her to stop frowning , or glaring , or fidgeting , and to stop saying " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while , as her embarrassment diminished , he did not have to tell her to stop doing anything . He told her practically every day that she had fantastic planes in her face , and that she was a far better subject than someone like Ellie , who was all glamour and no substance . He said girls like Ellie were a dime a dozen  --  just look at the magazines . Her face had character in it . Every afternoon he picked her up at school at three-thirty ,  |p100and  they went off on one of their photographic expeditions . And at night he was parked outside the Dairy Bar , waiting to drive her home . At least that was where he drove her the first week . When he asked one night about coming inside awhile , she said absolutely no . To her relief , he did not ask again , once she had consented to drive with him out beyond The Grove to the wooded bluff that overlooked the river , which was called Picnic Paradise by the Winnisaw County Park Commission and Passion Paradise by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lights , flip on the radio , and try with all his might to get her to go all the way . " Roy , I want to leave now . Really . " " Why ? " ? " I want to go home , please . " " I sort of love you , you know that . " " Do n't say that . You do n't . " " Angel , " he said , touching her face . " Stop . You almost put your finger in my eye . " " You sigh , the song begins , ' " he sang along with the radio , " you speak and I hear violins , it 's maaaa-gic . ' " " Roy , I 'm not going to do anything . So let 's go now . " " I 'm not asking you to do anything . I 'm only asking you to trust me . Just trust me , " he said , trying once again to put his fingers between the buttons of her uniform . " Roy , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not . Not if you do n't fight . Just trust me . " " I do n't know what that means . You say that , and when I do , then you only start going further . I do n't want that , Roy . " But he was singing into her ear . " Without a golden wand , Or mystic charms , Fantastic things begin , When I am in your . . . arms ! " Oh , Lucy , " he said . " Not there , " she cried , for on arms he had sunk an elbow , into her lap , as though by accident.  | " Oh , do n't fight me , do n't fight me , Lucy , " he whispered , digging round and round , " trust me ! " " Oh , stop ! No ! " " But I 'm outside your clothes  --  it 's only an elbow ! " " Take me home ! " Three weeks passed . She said that if that was all he was interested in each and every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other ever again . He said that it was n't all he was interested in , but he was a grown man and he had n't thought she was going to turn out to be just another kid who did n't know what life was all about . He had n't thought she was going to turn out to be like Ellie , a professional virgin  --  a c.t. , if she knew what that was . She did n't , and he said he had too much respect for her to tell her . The whole point was that he would n't even have started up in the first place with a girl he could n't respect ; nor would he have invited her out in the car if he did n't think she was mature enough to handle some ordinary premarital petting . She said petting was one thing and what he wanted was something else . He said he would even settle for petting if she would just relax ; she said that as soon as she started to relax , he stopped settling . She said she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe that was just too bad for her ; and she said well then , go back to her if that 's what you 're really after ; and he said maybe I will . And so the next afternoon when she came out of school the car was n't there . Ellie was n't waiting for her either ; she had stopped weeks ago , once Roy got involved with Lucy on his " Aspects of an Angel " series . Lucy did n't know what to do with herself . Again , nowhere to go . That night she was walking home from the Dairy Bar when a car pulled up alongside her . " Hey , girlie , want a lift ? " She did not look around . " Hey , Lucy . " He blew the horn and pulled over to the curb . " Hey , it 's me . Hop in , " he said , throwing open the door . " Hi , Angel . " She glared at him . " Where were you this afternoon , Roy ? " " Around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I waited for you . "  | " Oh , come on , forget it  --  get in . " " Do n't tell me what to do , Roy , " she said . " I 'm not Monkey Littlefield . " " Gee , I thought you were . " " And just what is that supposed to mean ? " " Nothing , nothing . It 's a joke ! " " Is that where you were this afternoon ? With her ? " " I was pining for you . Well , come on , I 'll drive you home . " " Not until you apologize for this afternoon . " " But what did I do ? " " You broke an engagement , that 's all . " " But we had a fight , " he said . " Remember ? " " Well , if we had a fight , why are you here now ? Roy , I wo n't be treated  --  " " Okay , okay , I 'm sorry . " " Are you ? Or are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Oh , get in the car , will you ? " " But you do apologize then , " she said . " Yes ! " She got into the car ... " Where do you think you 're driving , Roy ? " " I 'm just driving . It 's early . " " I want to go directly home . " " You 'll get home . Did you ever not get home ? " " Turn around , Roy . Please , let 's not start this again . " " Maybe I want to talk to you . Maybe I have some more apologizing to do . " " Roy , you 're not funny . I want to go home . Now stop this . " Just past The Grove he pulled onto the dirt road , instantly turning down his headlights ( the unwritten code of Passion Paradise ) until he came to a clearing where no other car was parked . He flipped the parking lights off now , and the radio on , and tuned in " Rendezvous Highlights . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Boy , either it 's coincidence or it 's just our song , " he said ,  |p103trying  to pull her head toward him . " Without a golden wand , or mystic charms '  --  " he sang . She resisted his gentle tug on the back of the neck , so he bent his face toward her closed mouth and wide-open eyes . " Angel , " he said . " You sound like a movie when you say that . Do n't . " " Oh , brother , " he said , " you can really destroy a mood . " " Well , I 'm sorry . I expected to be driven home . " " I 'll take you home ! You can at least move over for the time being , " he said . " Well , will you move over , please ? So I do n't get a steering wheel in my chest , do you mind ? " She began to shift to her right , but before she knew it he had her pinned up against the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he whispered . " Oh , Angel . You smell like the Dairy Bar . " " Well , I happen to work there . I 'm sorry . " " But I like it , " and then before she could speak again , he pressed his mouth on hers . He did not fall away until the record was over , then with a sigh . He waited to hear what the next song would be . " Do n't fight me , Lucy , " he whispered , stroking her hair . " Do n't ; it 's not worth it , " and along with Margaret Whiting he began to sing " There 's a tree in the meadow , with a stream drifting by '  --  " and to move his hand up under her slip . " Do n't , " he said , when she began to struggle . " Trust me . I just want to touch your knee . " " I do n't believe that , Roy . That 's ridiculous . " " I swear . I wo n't go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a knee ? " I will always rememberThe love in your eyeThe day you carved upon that tree , I love you till I die . They continued kissing . " See ? " he said , after several minutes had passed . " Did I move it ? Well , did I ? " " No . " " Did n't I say you could trust me ? "  | " Yes , " she said , " but do n't put your tongue on my teeth , please . " " Why not ? What 's it hurting ? " " Roy , you 're just licking my teeth , what 's the sense to it ? " " There 's a lot of sense to it ! It 's passion ! " " Well , I do n't want any . " " Okay , " he said , " okay . Calm down . I 'm sorry . I thought you liked it . " " There 's nothing even to like , Roy  --  " " Okay ! " There was a boy , A very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far , Very far , over land and sea . " I love this , " Roy said . " It 's just out . The guy who wrote it is supposed to live just like that . " " What is it ? " " Nature Boy . ' Just what the guy who wrote it actually is . It 's really got a great message . Listen to the words . " This he said to me : " The greatest thing you 'll ever learn , Is just to love , and be loved in return . " " Lucy , " Roy whispered , " let 's sit in the back . " " No . Positively no . " " Oh , hell , you do n't have any respect for a mood  --  do you know that ? " " But we do n't sit in the back , Roy . We tried to , but you really want to lie down in the back . " " Because the back does n't have a steering wheel , Lucy , and it 's more comfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleaned it out myself this afternoon . " " Well , I 'm not going back there  --  " " Well , I am ! And if you want to sit up here alone , go right ahead ! " " Oh , Roy  --  " But he was out of the car and into the back seat , where hep105promptly stretched out , his head against one door and his feet through the open window opposite . " That 's right , I 'm lying down . Why should n't I ? It 's my car . " " I want to go home . You said you 'd take me home . This is ridiculous . " " To you , sure . Boy , no wonder you and Ellie are friends . You 're a real team . " He mumbled something she could n't understand . " I 'd like to know what you said just then , Roy . " " I said two c.t . ' s , that 's what . " " And what are they ? " " Oh , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said , turning on her knees , now in real anger , " we went through this last week . " " Right ! Right ! We sat in the back . And did anything terrible happen ? " " Because I would n't let it , " she said . " So then do n't let it this time , " he said . " Look , Lucy , " and he sat up and tried to take hold of her head , which she pulled away . " I respect what you want , you know that . But all you want to do , " he said , slumping backward , " is to get your picture taken , and get driven home at night , and what the other person feels . . . well , I happen to feel something ! Oh , forget the whole mess , really . " " Oh , Roy , " and she opened the front door and got out of the car , as she had on that awful night the week before . Roy threw open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hinges . " Get in , " he whispered . In the back he told her how much he could love her . He was pulling at her uniform buttons . " Everybody says things like that when they want what you want , Roy . Stop . Please stop . I do n't want to do this . Honestly . Please . " " But it 's the truth , " he said , and his hand , which had touched down familiarly on her knee , went like a shot up her leg.  | " No , no  --  " " Yes ! " he cried triumphantly . " Please ! " And then he began to say trust me to her , over and over , and please , please , and she did not see how she could stop him from doing what he was doing to her without reaching up and sinking her teeth into his throat , which was directly over her face . He kept saying please and she kept saying please , and she could hardly breathe or move , he was over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't fight me , I could love you , Angel , Angel , trust me , and suddenly into her mind came the name , Babs Egan . " Roy  --  l " " But I love you . Actually now I do . " " But what are you doing ! " " I 'm not doing anything , oh , my Angel , my Angel  --  " " But you will . " " No , no , my Angel , I wo n't . " " But you 're doing it now ! Stop ! Roy , stop that ! " she screamed . " Oh , damn it , " he said , and sat up , and allowed her to pull her legs out from under him . She looked out the window at her side ; the glass had fogged over . She was afraid to look over at him . She did n't know whether his trousers were just down , or completely off . She could hardly speak . " Are you crazy ? " " What do you mean , crazy ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " You ca n't do something like that  --  by force ! That 's what I mean ! And I do n't want to do it anyway . Roy , get back in front . Dress yourself . Take me home . Now ! " " But you just wanted to . You were all ready to . " " You had my arms pinned . You had me trapped ! I did n't want anything ! And you were n't even going to  --  to be careful ! Are you absolutely insane ? I 'm not doing that ! " " But I would use something ! " She was astonished . " You would ? " " I tried to get some today . " " You did ? You mean you were planning this all day long ? "  | " No ! No ! Well , I did n't get them  --  did I ? Well , did I ? " " But you tried . You were thinking about it and planning it all day  --  " " But it did n't work ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I do n't want to . Take me home . Put your trousers on , please . " " They 're on . They were always on . Darn it , you do n't even know what I went through today . All you know is your own way , that 's all . Boy , you are another Ellie  --  another c.t. ! " " Which is what ! " " I do n't use that kind of language in front of girls , Lucy ! I respect you ! Does n't that mean anything to you at all ? You know where I was this afternoon ? I 'll tell you where , and I 'm not ashamed either  --  because it happened to involve respect for you . Whether you know it or not . " And then , while she pulled her slip down and rearranged her skirt , he told his story . For almost an hour he had waited outside Forester 's for Mrs. Forester to go upstairs and leave her goofy old husband alone at the counter . But once Roy got inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back into the storeroom , and she was up by the register ready to wait on him before he could even turn around and walk out . " So what could I do ? I bought a pack of Blackjack Gum . And a tin of Anacin . Well , what else was I supposed to do ? In every store in town my father 's name is a household word . Every place I go it 's Hi , Roy , how 's G.I. Joe ? ' And people see me with you , Lucy . I mean , they know we 're going together , you know . So who would they think it was for ? Do n't you think I think about that ? There 's your reputation to consider too , do n't you think ? There are a lot of things I happen to think about , Lucy , that maybe do n't cross your mind , sitting in school all day . " Somehow he had confused her . What really did she want him to do ? To have bought one of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her . She was n't going to let him plan what he was going to do to her hours in advance , and then act as though the whole thing was the passion of the moment . Shep108was n't going to be used or tricked , or be treated like some street tramp either . " But you were overseas , " she was saying . J " The Aleutians ! The Aleutian Islands , Lucy  --  across the Bering Sea from the U.S.S.R. ! Do you know what the motto is up there ? A woman behind every tree '  --  but there are no trees . Get it ? ' What do you think I did up there ? I made out order forms all day . I played eighteen thousand ping-pong games . What 's the matter with you ! " he said , sinking in disgust into the seat . " Overseas , " he said sourly . " You think I was up in some harem . " " . . . But what about with someone else ? " " I never did it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my entire life , all the way ! " " Well , " she said softly , " I did n't know that . " " Well , it 's the awful truth . I 'm twenty years old , almost twenty-one , but that does n't mean I go around doing it with every girl I see . I have to like the person , first of all . You listen to stupid Ellie , but Ellie does n't know what she 's talking about . The reason , Lucy , I do n't take Monkey Littlefield out is because I do n't happen to respect her . If you want the truth . And I do n't like her . And I do n't even know her ! Oh , forget it . Let 's just go , let 's just call it quits . If you 're going to listen to every story about me you hear , if you ca n't see the kind of person I am , Lucy , then pardon my language , but the hell with it . " He liked her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they were going together . She had n't realized . She was going with Roy Bassart , who was twenty and had been in the service . And people knew it. "  --  over in Winnisaw , " she was saying . Oh , why was she going on and on with this subject ? " Sure , I suppose they have them over in Winnisaw , they probably give them out on the streets in Winnisaw . " " Well , you could have driven over , that 's all I mean . " " But why should I ? Even going into Forester 's on Broadway is going too far , as far as you 're concerned . So ' what 's thep109sense ? Who am I kidding ? Myself ? I spent a whole afternoon hanging around outside waiting for that old hag to disappear , and it would n't have made any difference anyway . You 'd only hate me worse . Right ? So where does that leave me ? Well , what is it you want to say , Lucy ? That you 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No ! " " Okay , now we know where we stand ! Fine ! " He threw open the back door on his side . " Let 's go home ! I ca n't take any more of this , really . I happen to be a man and I happen to have certain physical needs , as well as emotional needs , you know , and I do n't have to take this from any high school kid . All we do is discuss every move I make , step by step . Is that romantic to you ? Is that your idea of a man-woman relationship ? Well , it 's not mine . Sex is one of the highest experiences anybody can have , man or woman , physical or mental . But you 're just another one of those typical American girls who thinks it 's obscene . Well , let 's go , Typical American Girl . I 'm really a good-natured , easygoing guy , Lucy , so it really takes something to get me in a state like this  --  but I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " She did n't move . He was really and truly angry , not like somebody who was trying to deceive you or trick you . " Well , what 's the matter now ? " he asked . " Well , what did I du wrong now ? " " I just want you to know , Roy , " she said , " that it is n't that I do n't like you . " He made the sour face . " No ? " " No . " " Well , you sure do hide it . " " I do n't , " she said . " You do ! " " ... But what if you do n't like me ? Really ? How can I know you 're telling the truth ? " " I told you , I do n't lie ! " When she did n't respond , he came closer to her . " You say love , " Lucy said . " But you do n't mean love . "  | " I get carried away , Lucy . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the mood . I like music , so it affects me . So that 's not a lie . ' " What had he just said ? She could n't even understand .. . He climbed back into the car . He put his hand on her hair . " And what 's wrong with getting carried away by the mood anyway ? " " But when the mood leaves you ? " she asked . She felt as though she were n't there , as though this were all happening a long time ago . " Tomorrow , Roy ? " " Oh , Lucy , " he said , and began kissing her again . " Oh , Angel . " " And what about Monkey Littlefield ? " " I told you , I told you , I do n't even know her  --  oh , Angel , please , " he said , sliding her down against the new slipcovers he himself had installed . " It 's you , it 's you , it 's you and only you  --  " " But tomorrow  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the next day , and the next  --  " " Roy , I ca n't  --  oh stop  --  " " But I 'm not . " " But you are ! " " Angel , " he moaned into her ear . " Roy , no , please . " " It 's okay , " he whispered , " it 's all right  --  " " Oh , it 's not ! " " But it is , oh , it is , I swear , " he said , and then he assured her that he would use a technique he had heard about up in the Aleutians , called interruption . " Just trust me , " he pleaded , " trust me , trust me , " and , alas , she wanted to so badly , she did . A week before Lucy 's graduation the news arrived : Roy had been accepted at the Britannia School of Photography and Design , which had been established , according to the catalogueand brochure , in 1910 . They were delighted to enrollp111him for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter of acceptance the dozen studies of Lucy he had enclosed with his application . At the little impromptu party he gave that evening in Roy 's honor  --  Ellie and Joe , Roy and Lucy , Mr. and Mrs. Bassart  --  Uncle Julian said they all owed a debt of gratitude to Lucy Nelson for being so photogenic . She deserved a prize too , so he gave her a kiss . He was still somebody whom she had n't made up her mind she actually approved of , and when she saw his lips coming her way she had a bad moment in which she almost pulled away . It was n't just Mr. Sowerby 's behavior with his wife , or his language , that caused her to be slightly repulsed ; nor the fact that someone five foot five and smelling of cigars was n't particularly her idea of attractive . It was that during the last month there had been several occasions when she thought she had caught him looking too long at her legs . Could Roy be telling his uncle what they were doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know they parked up at Passion Paradise , but so did Ellie and Joe Whetstone , and all they did was neck . At least that 's what Ellie said  --  and surely what her parents believed . No , nobody knew anything at all , and Mr. Sowerby was probably only looking at the floor , or at nothing , those times she thought he was looking at her legs . After all she was just eighteen , and he was Eleanor 's father , and her legs had no shape , or so she thought , and it was ridiculous to imagine , as she had when she had found herself alone with him in the house one Saturday afternoon , that he was going to follow her up to Ellie 's room and try to do something to her . She was getting sex on the brain , too . She and Roy really had to stop what they had begun , she just knew it . He liked it so much he was dragging her up there every night , and maybe she liked it too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What was , then ? That 's what Roy asked , whenever she started saying , " No , no , not tonight . " But why not tonight , if last night ? Anyway , when Mr. Sowerby kissed her it was loud and on the cheek , and everyone was laughing , and Mrs. Sowerby was right there watching , trying to laugh too . It was as unlikep112Lucy as anything could be  --  in a way it was one of the strangest things she had ever done  --  but in the confusion that came of being told in public that she was attractive , in the excitement that came of being so much a part of this celebration , of this family , of this house , she shrugged her shoulders , turned bright red and kissed Uncle Julian back . Roy applauded . " Bravo ! " he cried , and Mrs. Sowerby stopped trying to laugh . Well , too bad for her . There really was very little Lucy could do that met with Mrs. Sowerby 's approval . She was a dowdy , snobbish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was she who had finally had the strongest influence in deciding what Roy should become . Which was certainly none of Mrs. Sowerby 's business  --  even though that did appear to be the case : why Roy had decided to go to photography school in Fort Kean , where Britannia was located , seemed to have less to do with the quality of the traininghe would receive there  --  or with whatever natural talent he had for taking pictures , to be frank  --  than with the fact that Lucy happened to be going down to school in Fort Kean too . That Roy had been guided in his decision by such a considerationwas hardly a fact that displeased Lucy . On the other hand , it was one more refutation of that idea she had formed of him before they had met : that he was a serious young man who had choices before him of real magnitude and gravity . No , he was n't exactly turning out to be entirely as she had imagined him back then  --  not that that was all to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't as rude and illmanneredas he had first appeared . And he was n't indifferent to others ' feelings ; least of all to hers . Once the showing off had stopped , once he was no longer as frightened of her ( she realized ) as she had been of him , he was altogether sweet and considerate . In his amiability he even reminded her a little of Mr. Valerio , which was certainly a compliment . Nor was he superior in his attitudes , which was something she had just assumed would be the case , given his age and experience . He never tried to boss her around  --  except for sex ;  |p113and  even there she knew that when she decided enough was enough ( probably that very night ) , there was nothing he would he able to do to force her to resume . There was nothing he could have done to force her to start , either , only why had n't she realized that at the time ? The worst that could have happened was that he would never have seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Truthfully , there were a lot of important ways in which she was discovering that she did n't like Roy that much . At times it even seemed as though it were she who was two and a half years older than Roy , not the other way around . She simply could n't bear him when he sang those songs into her ear , first of all . He was so childish sometimes , even if he was now twenty-one and old enough to vote , as he kept saying to everyone . Sometimes the things he said were nothing less than stupid . In the car , for instance , he kept telling her that he loved her . . . But was that stupid ? What if it was true ? Or what if he was only saying it for fear that if he did n't she would n't let him go all the way any more ? Oh , she knew , she knew , she knew  --  they should never have started up in the car . It was n't right if you were n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never could marry , either . We must stop ! But somehow it made no more sense to stop now that they had begun than it had made to start in the first place . What she should really stop was the whole stupid thing ! Yes , she was very , very confused  --  even on that wonderful , cheery night at the Sowerbys ' , which began with Uncle Julian ( as Roy had encouraged her to call him ) kissing her as though she were another member of the family , and ended with his bringing out of the refrigerator a real bottle of French champagne , exploding cork and all . . . Oh , how could she possiblybelieve the suspicion , growing larger in her every day , that he probably was n't going to have one of any consequence at all , when they all stood around him with glasses raised , and said in unison , " To Roy 's future ! " After graduation she began her summer schedule at the Dairy Bar : from ten to six , every day but Wednesday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Fort Kean one Wednesday to look for a place for him to live in September . After inspecting each rooming house he came back to where Lucy sat in the parked car , and said he did n't think the place was right , at least for him ; either the room smelled funny , or the landlady looked suspicious , or the bed was too short , something he had had enough of for sixteen months in the Aleutians . In the one place that was ideal  --  one huge room with a bed in it that used to be the landlady 's husband 's ( who 'd been six foot five ) , where the toilet was spotless , and the roomer guaranteed a shelf of his own in the refrigerator  --  there was no private entrance . Well , said Lucy , there had to be . At four that afternoon they had the worst argument they had ever had with each other , and far and away the worst Roy had ever had with anyone , his father included . To what was still the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her head and say no , there had to be a private entrance if he expected ever to see her again . Suddenly , crying out , " Well , I do n't care  --  it 's me who has to live here ! " he wheeled the Hudson around and drove back to the house with the long bed . When he got back to the car he took a road map from the glove compartment and on its face carefully drew a rectangle . " This is my room , " he said , managing not to look at her . It was on the first floor , a corner room with two tall windows on either side ; all four let out onto a wide porch surrounded by shrubs . They were as good as four private entrances . At night a person could just step in and out of the windows exactly as though they were doors . . . Well , what did she want to say ? Was she really planning on never speaking to him again , or did she have an opinion to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " It did n't mean anything to you . " " It did . " " But you went ahead and rented the room anyway . " " Because I wanted to , yes ! "  | " I have nothing further to say , Roy . " " Lucy , it 's a room ! It 's only a room ! Why are you doing this ? " " You did it , Roy . Not me . " " Did what ? " " Acted like a child , again . " Before starting back to Liberty Center , Roy drove around to the Fort Kean College for Women . He pulled the car to the curb so Lucy could take another look at her new home . The college was across Pendleton Park from the main business section of Fort Kean . It had been built as a boys ' preparatory school in the 189o 's ; in the thirties the school went under , and the property had been unused until the war , when it was occupied by the Army Signal Corps . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , barracks and all , for its expanding educational program . It was certainly not the ivycoveredcollege campus one saw in the movies , or read about in books ; the barracks that the Army had thrown up , long faded yellow buildings , were used as classrooms , and the administration building and dormitory was an old square fortress-like structure of gray stone that stood almost directly onto the street and resembled the County Courthouse in Winnisaw . At the sight of it , however , Lucy thought , " Only fifty-nine days more . " " Which is your room ? " asked Roy , looking out the car window . She did not answer . The school was across from a row of stores , one of which was called " The Old Campus Coffee Shop . " Roy said , " Hey , want a Coke in The Old Campus Coffee Shop ? " No answer . " Oh , Angel , I do care what you think . You know that . What you think is important to me . But I have to live somewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be reasonable  --  do n't I ? That 's not being a kid , or a child , or whatever you said . " " Yes , Roy , " she finally said , " you have to live somewhere . " " Do n't be sarcastic , Lucy , really . Sometimes you 're just toop116sarcastic , when I 'm only asking for a simple answer . I 've got to get my eight hours ' sleep if I expect to get the most out of classes . Well , do n't I ? So I need the long bed . Well , is that a stupid statement too ? " She thought , Everything you say is a stupid statement ! " No , " she said , for he had taken her hand , and really seemed to be in pain . " So then how can you be angry ? Lucy , come on , what 's the sense of fighting ? Let 's have a Coke , okay ? Then we 'll start home . Come on , say the fight is over . Why ruin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrible sin , or are you going to keep this silly thing up forever ? " He actually appeared to be near tears . She saw that there was no point in arguing with him any further . For in that instant she made up her mind  --  if only she had made it up earlier in the day , she could have saved them both the misery of a fight : she would never set foot in that room of his so long as she lived , no matter how many windows it had , or even doors . It was really as simple as that . " Okay , " she said , " let 's have a Coke . " " That 's my girl , " said Roy , kissing her on the nose , " that 's my old angel girl . " From that afternoon on she knew for sure that Roy was n't for her . That very night she would not drive up with him to Passion Paradise . When instantly he grew sulky and morose , and seemed about ready to break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was not well . It happened to be the truth , but then at home with a thick black crayon she circled on her calendar the day she would make it altogether clear their romance was over ( at the same time x-ing out another day of her life in Liberty Center : fifty-eight to go ) . It looked as though the bad news could not be broken to Roy until Sunday : the following night there were already plans to drive up to the Selkirk Fair with Ellie and Joe , with whom they doubled at least once a week now that Lucy was working only during the day ; and on Friday evening Roy expected her to go over to Winnisaw with him to see A Datep117with . Judy ; then on Saturday there was the barbecue at the Sowerbys ' . It was a barbecue for the Sowerbys ' adult friends , and when Roy 's uncle had invited " the long drink of water " to come and to bring " Blondie " with him , it had delighted Lucy ( secretly ) no less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more all the time , and to admire certain of his qualities . As Roy said , he really did n't give a hoot about people 's opinions ; he did and said whatever he wanted , whenever he wanted . She still thought he was a little coarse with his language , but she did n't object , corny though it was , when he called her " Blondie , " which seemed to have become his nicknamefor her , or even when he put his arm around her waist one evening and said ( in a joshing way , of course , and winking at Rov ) , " You just tell me , Blondie , when you get tired of looking up at this big lug and want to look down at a little one . " She would have circled Friday then instead of Sunday , had it not been for the Sowerbys ' Saturday night barbecue , at which her presence had specifically been requested by the host himself . That was awfully hard to turn down . She supposed she could wait until Sunday without losing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fact . Surely any diversion , even if it involved Roy , was better than sitting up in her hot room , listening to her family rocking downstairs on the porch ; or lying awake in the dark bedroom , unable to sleep until she heard her father 's footsteps coming up the stairs and she had determined ( solely for the record ) whether he was actually going off to bed sober . What had always made summer particularly awful was that with all the doors and windows open , her sense of the presence of those whom she could hardly abide was painfully , horribly acute . Just to hear someone she hated yawn could drive her to distraction if she happened to be in an angry mood . Now , however , she was out every night until twelve-thirty , by which time they were usually asleep ( not that it was any pleasure hearing someone you hated snore , if it made you start thinking about them ) . On the hottest nights , rather than beingp118locked up with her family , she and Roy would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , catching what breeze there was and staring off into the black stillness of water under the Winnisaw Bridge . She would think about college and Fort Kean  --  away , away  --  and often Roy would begin to sing to her , in a voice that really was n't that bad , or so she was willing to admit in the pleasure of contemplating the future that would soon be hers . He sang like Vaughan Monroe , and like Dick Haymes ; he could do Nat " King " Cole singing " Nature Boy , " and Mel Blanc doing " Woody Woodpecker , " and Ray Bolger ( whom he thought he resembled in build ) doing " Once in Love with Amy . " After they saw The Jolson Story he did for her his imitation of the incomparable Al Jolson . That was how Roy introduced himself as hand in hand they sat down by the river on those close nights during what was to be the last summer of Lucy 's arduous and unhappy youth . " Ladies and gentlemen , if you will , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Oh , how we danced , On the night we were wed , We danced and we danced  --  " Fifty-eight days . Fifty-seven . Fifty-six . At the Sowerby barbecue on Saturday night she got into a long , serious discussion with Roy 's father  --  their first real talk  --  in which she heard herself assuring Mr. Bassart that he really should n't have anxiety or doubt any longer about Roy 's future . Mr. Bassart said that he still could not figure where the interest in photography had suddenly come from . His experience with young people had long ago convinced him not to bank too heavily on sudden enthusiasms , since they had a habit of disappearing under strain . He was , he admitted , relieved that the months wasted wading around in what he called " a swamp of half-baked ideas " had come to an end , but now what concerned him was whether Roy had really chosen something he was going to be able to stick with when the going gotp119rough . What did Lucy think ? Oh , said Lucy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . " What makes you so sure ? " asked Mr. Bassart in his flat voice . She thought quickly and said that photography was n't such an astonishing interest for Roy to have , when you thought that really it was a wonderful way of combining his present interest in drawing with his old interest in printing . Mr. Bassart reflected upon what she had said . So did she , reddening . " I think that 's true , in a manner of speaking , Mr. Bassart . " " It 's clever , " he said without smiling , " but whether it 's true is something I 'll have to think about . What about your own plans ? What are your own personal educational goals ? " Perspiring away under the brand-new peasant blouse that she had purchased for the party , she told him . . . Develop a logical mind . . . self-discipline . . . increase her general fund of knowledge . . . learn more about the world we live in . . . learn more about herself .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly as it had been in the scholarship application ) , but when Mr. Bassart finally said , during a paragraph break , " Those are all good goals , " she believed she had won approval enough for the time being , and shut up . And  --  she later realized  --  he had asked not a single question about her background He did not appear to be any more interested in the subject than Julian Sowerby ; men like that judged you not on family history , but on the kind of person you were . Only Mrs. Bassart ( who seemed to have fallen instantly under her sister 's influence ) and Irene Sowerby seemed to hold against her things she was n't even responsible for . The others , to their credit , were n't interested in gossip and ancient history  --  Roy included . Since the beginning of summer Roy had taken to picking her up at the house after dinner each night . She was always ready when he arrived , giving him little encouragement , shep120hoped , to linger and make conversation . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draw her into revealing something , she answered so sharply that he had never brought up the subject again . It was after his first meeting with her family , all of whom were gathered in the living room after dinner . The young man arrived , was quickly introduced and led by Lucy straight back out the door . Driving over to the movie , Roy said , " Wow , your mother 's a real looker , you know that ? " " Yes . " " You know who she reminds me of ? " " No . " " Jennifer Jones . " No answer . " Listen , did you see Song ofBernadette ? " She had , with Kitty Egan , three times ; but her conversion was her own business too . It had n't even taken place . " Of course , your mother 's older than Jennifer Jones ... " Roy said . " And your grandfather is Mr. Carroll from the post office . Now , I did n't even know that . Ellie never mentioned it . " " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had she given in when he said it was time he was introduced to her " folks " ? They were crossing the Winnisaw Bridge . " Well , your father seems like a nice guy . " " I do n't talk about him , Roy ! I never want to talk about him ! " " Gee , sure , okay , " he said , raising one hand over his chest . " Just making conversation . " " Well , do n't . " " Well , okay , I wo n't . " " That subject does not interest me at all . " " Okay , okay , " he said , smiling , " you 're the boss , " and after a silent minute during which she contemplated asking him to pull the car over to the side so that she could get out , he switched on the radio and began to sing . From then on , neither Bassart nor Sowerby asked any question about her home life . Ellie could n't have cared less ,  |p121and  so it was only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother , that Lucy became unduly conscious of what ordinarilyshe was able , after all these years of practice , to drive clear out of her mind . Of late she hardly ever had cause ( outside the house ) to think of herself as the kid who had done this or the kid whose father had done that . To the many people she met socially at the Sowerbys ' for the first time on that Saturday night  --  among them , the principal , Mr. Brunn and his wife  --  she was , very simply , Roy Bassart 's girl . " So , " said Mr. Brunn , " this is the young lady I hear is keeping our old alum in line these days . " " Oh , it 's a matter of opinion , Mr. Brunn , who 's keeping who in line , " said Roy . " And are you off to school in September , dear ? " asked Mrs. Brunn . Dear . Just like Mrs. Sowerby . " Yes , " said Lucy . " Fort Kean College for Women . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down there , " said Mr. Brunn . " Very nice . Very nice . " " Lucy graduated twenty-ninth in the senior class this year , Mr. Brunn , before she tells you herself . " " Oh , I recognized Lucy  --  I knew she was up there . Good luck to you , Lucy . Keep up our reputation . We 've sent them some fine girls down there and I 'm sure you 're going to turn out to be no exception . " " Thank you , Mr. Brunn . I 'll try my best . " " Well , that 'll do it , I 'm sure . See you , Roy ; see you , Lucy . " So , later that night , up in Passion Paradise , what could she do ? It was n't till Sunday that she was to tell him that she 'd had enough , and it was still only Saturday night . And when she told him , what would happen ? " I 'm not going to be able to see you again . Ever . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really have any business together , Roy . " " But . . . what do you mean ? Have n't these months meant anything at all ? Look , why else am I going to Fort Kean to school  --  who inspired me to go there , except you ? " " Well , you 'll just have to go for a better reason than that . " " What better reason is there but love ! "  | " But it 's not love  --  it 's just sex . " " It 's what ? " " Sex ! " " Not to me . . . Look , is that what it is to you ? Because to me .. . Oh , no , " he 'd weep , " this is terrible . . . " And then  --  she just knew it  --  he would n't go to Fort Kean at all . If she broke off with him now , he would give up Britannia , give up all his plans , probably in the end give up photography too , despite what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And then he would be right back in his swamp of ideas . . . But that was his affair , not hers . . . Or was it ? He was so good to her , so kind to her , sweeter to her than anybody had ever been before in her life , and day in and day out too . How could she turn around now and be so heartless and cruel ? Especially when it was only a matter of a few more weeks . It might even mean his whole career . Because he depended on her  --  he listened to her  --  he loved her . Roy loves me . At least that 's what he said . " I love you , Angel , " he said at the door . He kissed her nose . " You made a real hit tonight . " " On who ? " " Mr. Brunn , for one . Everybody . " He kissed her yet again . " Me , " he said . " Look , sleep tight . " From the bottom of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was very , very confused . Ten months ago she was still in the band , marching behind Leola Krapp , and now she was going steady ! Going all the way practically every night ! She circled six days in July , and ten in August , and then on September first she took her crayon and circled four times around the day after Labor Day . She had started out to circle Labor Day itself , until she remembered that she and Roy and Ellie and Joe Whetstone were to go off canoeing on the river , an event that had been planned by Roy weeks before . If only everything were n't planned so far in advance ! If only he did n't need her so , depend on her so , love her so ! Rut did he ? When they arrived on Labor Day morning at the Sowerbys ' , Roy 's Aunt Irene came outside to say that Ellie had been sick in the night and was still sleeping . She suggested that the three young people had better go off by themselvesp123for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sad and wan-looking Ellie appeared in the upstairs hall window , wearing her bathrobe . She waved . " Hi . " " Ellie , " said Mrs. Sowerby , " I suggested to the others that they 'd better go off without you today , dear . " " Oh , no . " " Eleanor , if you 're not well , you surely can not go canoeing . " " Your mother 's right , " said Joe . " But I want to go , " Ellie called down in a weak voice . " It would n't be safe , El , " said Joe . " Really . " " Joe is right , Eleanor , " said Mrs. Sowerby . " But I planned to go , " said Ellie , and suddenly she drew down the shade , as though she was about to weep . It was decided that the three young people should come inside while Ellie washed and dressed and had a little breakfast of tea and toast ; then if she really did seem to have recovered , perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's troubles had begun the previous evening while Mrs. Sowerby had been away at an informal meeting of the officers of The Quilt Society . In Mrs. Sowerby 's absence , Ellie and her father had sat around the TV set , eating three pounds of cherries , followed by a quart of vanilla fudge ice cream , topped off with half a chocolate nut cake left over from dinner . Julian Sowerby , feeling fine , claimed Ellie 's upset stomach had nothing to do with a little dish of ice cream and a piece of cake ; Ellie simply had the heebie-jeebies about going away to school in two weeks . Roy said that maybe Ellie had inherited her father 's good looks ( everyone laughed , Julian loudest of all ) but that perhaps she had n't been so fortunate as to inherit his cast-iron stomach . " That 's probably true , Mr. Sowerby " was Joe 's comment . Joe assured Mrs. Sowerby that if she let Ellie come along , he would be sure to see that she did n't touch anything sweet . Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Roy said that he and Joe would take care of Ellie 's portion without too much trouble . In a few minutes Ellie came down the stairs in white shorts ,  |p124white  polo shirt and white sandals . Her tan  --  nurtured daily on the back lawn and down by the landing  --  looked dazzling , as did her hair , which over the summer had taken on a coppery sheen . But this morning her face looked small and worn , and her " Hullo " was hardly audible as she went off to the kitchen to try to put a little food into her long , shapely body .. . Her body . Her long and shapely body ! Lucy 's understanding of Ellie 's condition was instantaneous . My God , it 's happened . To Ellie Sowerby . Julian Sowerby drove off with his clubs to the Winnisaw Golf Club , and the young people consented to forgo the canoeing and take Mrs. Sowerby 's advice and find a nice shady spot up at the picnic grounds to have their outing . But even hidden away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o'clock Ellie began to feel woozy , and so they drove back to the Sowerbys ' in Roy 's car . The house was very quiet . The shades were drawn in the front bedroom , where apparently Mrs. Sowerby was taking a nap ; and the family car was still gone , a fact that caused Ellie some consternation . Apparently she had expected to find her father already home . " Do you want me to wake your mother , El ? " asked Joe . " No , no . I 'm all right . " Joe and Roy decided to go out to the backyard and listen to the Sox double-header on the Sowerby portable . Ellie asked Lucy to come up with her to her room . Once there she locked the door , threw herself onto her bed , and beneath the white organdy canopy , began to cry . Lucy watched her friend weeping her heart out . On the lawn below she saw the person responsible pick up a croquet mallet and begin to knock a ball around through the wickets . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the University of Alabama . Partly it was Ellie 's recollection of life in the South during the early years of the war that seemed to have influenced Joe to accept the Alabama scholarship . Joe was to leave for school the very next day  --  but would he still go ? Or would Ellie now go with him ? Roy had organized the day 's outing , and had his motherp125prepare the lunch as his own farewell party to Joe Whetstone , whom he had come to consider his closest buddy . Lucy herself had always thought of Joe as one big blah . Sure , he was a great athlete , she supposed , and you had to admit he was handsome and rugged-looking , if you liked that type , but he had not a single opinion of his own on any subject . Whatever you said , Joe agreed with . There were times when she felt like reciting the Declaration of Independence just to watch his head go up and down and to hear him say , after every famous sentence , " You bet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of sense , boy , that 's just what my Mom says . . . " The temptation to reveal him for the imbecile that he was came over her most strongly when Roy was purposely acting for Joe 's benefit , telling some funny story about what had happened to him up in the Aleutians , or discussing some college football team he and Joe called " The Crimson Tide " and which normally he did n't seem to be interested in at all . But she had never given in to the temptation ; she had n't even told Ellie her real opinion of Joe ' Whetstone . And now it was too late . Now Joe had gotten Ellie into trouble , the worst kind of trouble there could possibly be for a girl . And Joe did n't even appear to know it . Roy called to Joe . " Appling 's up . Two on . No score . " " Go , Luke , " said Joe , knocking the wooden ball clear through a wicket at the other end of the lawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Oh , boy , " Roy said sourly , " swing and a miss . Strike one . " " Come on , Lukey babe , " said Joe , posing with his mallet like a batter all coiled up to swing . " Hey , " said Joe , " Stan the Man , " and he changed his batting stance and swung at an imaginary ball . " Gooing , going  --  " " Foul ! " said Roy . " Shucks , " said Joe , " pulled it too hard . " " Shhh , " said Roy , looking quickly up at the house as Joe fell to the lawn laughing . ... ' What about college now ? What about the Sowerbys ? What about Ellie 's future , if she had to marry Joe Whetstone ? And what if he already knew and did n't care ? Maybe hep126wanted to marry Ellie , but she was crying because she did n't want to marry him ! " I have  --  I have to tell somebody , " Ellie said , turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What ? " said Lucy softly . " Tell what , Ellie ? " Ellie pushed her head back into the pillow and again began to weep . She had done a stupid thing . A terrible , stupid thing . Her whole life would never be the same . " ... Why ? What is it ? " She had listened in on someone else 's telephone conversation . " And it 's not the first time , either , " said Ellie , sobbing . Then she 's not pregnant . Down below Roy said , " Base hit ! " " Go , Sox , " said Joe . " Pour it on , baby . " " And the run scores ! " cried Roy . " And another ! Two nothing ! " Petulantly Lucy said , " What do you mean ? Ellie , I ca n't understand you . " " I listened in on someone else 's telephone conversation .. . and it was awful . " " Whose ? " " Oh , Lucy , I do n't want my mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Is the door locked ? " asked Ellie . " You locked it , " said Lucy impatiently . " Then ... Sit over here . On the bed . I do n't want to shout . Oh , I do n't know what to do . This is so awful ... I 've been trying to tell you for so long . I needed somebody 's advice that I could talk it over with ... But I just could n't . And I should n't . Oh , but I just have to  --  but , Lucy , you have to promise me . You ca n't repeat it to anyone . Not even Roy . Especially not Roy . " " Ellie , I do n't even understand what you 're  --  " " My father ! " said Ellie . " Lucy , do n't tell ever  --  do you promise ? You have to promise me , Lucy . Please , so I can tell you . " " I promise . "  | " My father has women ! " Ellie burst out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with equanimity : it was as though a truth she had known in her heart all along had finally been confessed by Eleanor . " And that 's not all , " said Ellie . " Lucy . . . he gives them money . " " Are you sure ? " " Yes . " " How do you know he does ? " " That 's what I heard on the phone . " She closed her eyes . " Actual money , " she said , and the tears rolled off her cheeks onto her white polo shirt . Just then they heard the door to Mrs. Sowerby 's room open , down the hall . " Dear , are you in there ? " she asked . " Yes . Lucy too . We 're only talking , Mother . " " Are you all right ? " " It got too hot , Mother , " said Ellie , frantically wiping her eyes . " But I 'm fine . I promise . It was practically a hundred , though . And buggy . And crowded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment they heard nothing ; then the sound of Mrs. Sowerby descending the stairs . Neither of them spoke until the screen door opened down below and Joe was saying , " Sox are out in front , Mrs. Sowerby , four to nothing . " " Sure , " said Roy , " she 's the right one to tell , all right . Hey , Aunt Irene , tell Joe which team Luke Appling plays for . No , no , tell him what a bunt is . Come on , give him your great definition of a bunt . " Roy and Joe could be heard down on the back lawn , teasing Mrs. Sowerby about sports , and Mrs. Sowerby could be heard obligingly making them laugh . . . while upstairs Eleanor began to tell Lucy the whole story . It had begun about a year ago , on a summer night when she and her father had been home alone . It was after eleven and she was in bed , when suddenly she remembered she had forgotten to tell Judy Rollins not to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so she reached over and picked up her bedside telephone . Of course , the instant she heard her father talking on the downstairs line she knew she should hang up . Only , the voice on the other end she recognized as belonging to nobody but Mrs. Mayerhofer , the managerof Daddy 's laundromat in Selkirk , about whom he was always complaining to her mother . Mrs. Mayerhofer was , as he put it , a little slow on the pickup ; there actually was n't a single thing that he did n't have to explain to her ten times before she got it right . He kept her on almost solely out of pity  --  abandoned by her husband , she had an infant child to support  --  and because , unlike her predecessor , the illustrious Mrs. Jarvis , it did n't appear that Mrs. Mayerhofer was going to steal him deaf , dumb and blind . On the phone her father was saying that he just could n't get up to Selkirk until the end of the week because he was so tied up right here in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think she could wait until the end of the week , and Ellie still remembered thinking , " Boy , what a moron , " until she heard her father laugh and say that in the meantime then she was just going to have to make do with the old hot-water bottle . Mrs. Mayerhofer laughed , and Ellie said it was as though her bones and her blood and everything inside her had turned to stone . She pushed the receiver down into her pillow and held it there for what seemed like ages ; when at last she raised it to her ear again , the line was free  --  and so she called Rollins . What else could she do ? This was just before she and Lucy had first gotten to know each other , Ellie said . Actually , she had been dying back then to tell Lucy what she had overheard , only she 'd felt so ashamed and embarrassed  --  and very shortly so uncertain as to whether what she had heard meant what she had taken it to mean  --  that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rather than risk ruining their friendship and making a terrible fool of herself and her family . For the moment Ellie 's words confused Lucy , and not simply because of the disordered way in which her friendp129offered her explanation . She had to work out in her head the significance of all that Ellie had just said  --  that is , the significanceto herself . She would lie awake , Ellie was saying , just lie awake after that for hours on end , in dread of ever overhearing such a conversation again . . . and then silently lift the phone off the receiver . It was a nightmare ; she did n't want to catch him , and she could n't stop trying to . Then that winter her father came home one evening and said that Mrs. Mayerhofer ( " my mental giant " was his expression ) had flown the coop ; just disappearedfrom her apartment in Selkirk  --  baby , baggage and all . The very next day he drove up to interview and hire somebodyelse for the job . The woman selected was named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She never heard him with Mrs. Mayerhofer on the phone a second time , nor was there any reason for her to suspect Edna Spatz . Yet every time her father went off to the Selkirk store , Ellie knew it was to carry on behind her mother 's back  --  even though she knew too that Edna Spatz had a husband in Selkirk and two small children . This was about the time she and Lucy had started seeing each other again , and on more occasions than she could even count , Ellie had wanted to blurt out to her the whole horrible story about Mrs. Mayerhofer . Only Mrs. Mayerhofer was so terribly dumb and uneducated . So he could n't with her , he simply could n't . He simply would n't even want to . Or so she had gotten herself to believe , until last night . She had been on the stairs when the phone rang , and so she raced up to her room thinking that it was Joe , who had said he would call around nine . In the meantime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's okay , Princess , " he had called up to her , " it 's just for me . " She had called back , " Okay , Daddy , " and gone ahead into her room , closed the door , and without any knowledge that she was even going to do it , gently lifted the phone off the hook . At first she could n't even hear the words being spoken . It was as though she had a heartp130beating in her head , and another in her throat , and the rest of her simply did n't exist . On the other end a woman was speaking . Whether it was Edna Spatz , she did n't know . She had come to imagine Mrs. Spatz as no less a dimwit than Mrs. Mayerhofer , and the trouble with the voice on the other end was that it sounded smart . . . and young . The woman was saying that if she could n't cover her check she did n't know what would happen to her . Her father said this was something he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by telephone . He was whispering into the phone , but he was angry . The woman began to cry . She said that the agency had threatened to take her to court . She called him Julian , Julian , and she wept . She said she was sorry , she knew she should n't call , she had dialed and hung up half a dozen times over the weekend , but who else did she have to turn to but Julian , Julian ? It was at that point that Ellie felt she could not bear to hear another word . The woman sounded so unhappy  --  and so young ! So she buried the phone in the pillow again , and just sat there , not knowing what to do . Only a minute or so later her father called up the stairs to her . She replaced the phone as quietly as she could and came quickly down to him , chattering gaily all the while . She knew he was watching her every expression to see whether she had been listening , but Ellie was sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had said or done . She kept talking about Joe this and Joe that , and instantly sat next to him on the couch when invited to  --  " Keep me company , Daisy Mae "  --  and even let him hold her hand while the two of them watched TV together and ate all those cherries . That 's why she had consumed so much junk ; she was afraid to stop for fear he would think something was botheringher . And all the time they were sitting on the couch she had the most absurd thought : that she had an older sister , whom she knew nothing about , and that it was she who had been on the phone asking her father to send money . Of course she was only making up the idea of a sister , and knew it  --  and so then she began to think that maybe she was making up the whole incident.  | " Lucy , I 'm so confused  --  and miserable ! Because I just do n't know . Do you think it 's true ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Well , you heard it , did n't you ? " " I do n't know . Yes ! But who is it ? Who could it possibly be ? And my poor mother , " she said , weeping profusely once again , " she does n't even know . Nobody knows . Nobody but you and me  --  and him ... and her ! " All the youngsters were invited to stay for supper on the Sowerby lawn : roast beef sandwiches , corn on the cob , apple pie and ice cream  --  except for Ellie , who had consomme , half of which she left in the bowl . Mr. Sowerby offered each of the boys a bottle of beer , against Mrs. Sowerby 's better judgment . " Come on , they 'll all be in college in a week . Roy here is responsible for us winning the war against the North Pole . A little beer 'll do him good , put some hair on his chest . " Joe took a sip and laid the glass aside ; Roy drank his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top button of his shirt and looked inside . " Nothing , " he said . They sat out on the lawn till long after dark . Ellie was stretched out in a beach chair with an afghan thrown over her , and just her head sticking out . It looked very , very small . Roy sat on the grass , holding his beer bottle in one hand ; his head swung back against Lucy 's legs whenever he took a swig from the bottle . Joe Whetstone was stretched out on his stomach , his chin resting on his two fists . He was looking up at the sky , and every once in a while he said , " Boy , oh , boy . Look at them all . " Roy said he 'd known a guy in the service who believed in the stars . Joe said , " No kidding . " " Absolutely , " said Roy , " to some people it 's practically a religionin itself . " " No kidding , " said Joe . " I wonder how many there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " Better , " she answered after a moment . " I believe you were just missing home , " said Julian Sowerby , " before you even went away from it . " " Boy , I 'll bet that can happen , " said Joe . " Sure , sure . Homesick , plus all that vanilla fudge ice cream with , I understand from reliable sources , a little butterscotch sauce , and walnuts  --  " " Roy ! " cried Ellie weakly . Roy and Joe laughed . " Roy , do n't tease her , " said Mrs. Sowerby . " Sorry , Ellie-o , " said Roy . Julian lit a cigar . " How about it , Joe ? " " Oh , no , sir , " Joe said . " Got to stay in shape . " " Wo n't affect your toe , boy , " Julian said . " No , thank you just the same , Mr. Sowerby . Did n't mean to waste the beer either . " " Take it off my taxes , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , General ? " he asked Roy . " Sure , " said Roy , " if it 's a good one . Toss . " Julian threw a cigar his way . " Fourteen-fifty a box , it ai n't what I could call a stinkweed , wise guy . " The smoke from Roy 's cigar rose around his head . " Not too bad , " he said , holding it off at arm 's length and muffling a cough . " A real pro , " said Uncle Julian . Ordinarily Lucy could n't stand to watch Roy smoke a cigar or drink a beer ; he really cared very little for either . But this evening there were matters more grave to brood upon than Roy 's showing off for his uncle . There was the uncle himself , whose secret had finally been revealed ; there was Ellie , who knew the secret ; there was Mrs. Sowerby , who did not ; and there was herself . All these months she had been believing that Ellie was indifferent to her past , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caused Ellie to befriend her in September , and to resume that " friendship " again in February . It was a startling discovery . All this time , so stupidly , so innocently , so dreamily , she had been thinking that to Elliep133Sowerby she was not the kid whose father hung out at Earl 's Dugout , not the kid who had gained notoriety by calling the police to come take him away , when that was precisely who she was . All she was . It had caused her much pain that afternoon to understand that all of her attraction for Ellie lay in that past which she herself wanted never to think about again so long as she lived . And it had made her angry too . Her temptation earlier in the afternoon had been to rise in indignation and tell Ellie exactly what she thought of her . " You mean that 's what I am to you , Ellie ? That 's why you wanted me to be a friend ? To my face , you actually have the nerve to admit that when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't need me any more ? And what exactly did you think I was going to do for you , anyway , in return for letting me wear your precious sweater ? " On and on and on , but in her head only . At first she restrainedher anger so as to hear the story of Julian Sowerby 's deception to its conclusion , but even before Ellie had finished , she began to understand Eleanor 's attraction to her as something else entirely . Ellie actually admired her . Her courage . Her pride . Her strength . Was n't that a deeper way , a truer way , to see it ? Ellie Sowerby , with all her clothes , and boys , and beauty , and money , had turned for help and advice  --  to her . Well , what should Ellie do , then ? What ? Her mind began to examine the possibilities . " Hey , what happened to Blondie tonight ? " Julian was asking . " Cat got Cutie-Pie 's tongue ? " " Oh , no . " " Thinking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Sowerby . " Yes . " " It 's going to be a wonderful experience for all of you , " said Irene Sowerby . " These will be the four most beautiful years of your life . " " That 's what my Mom says too , Mrs. Sowerby , " said Joe.  | . " Yes , it 's going to do all of you a world of good , " said Mrs. Sowerby , " to be away from home . " Poor Mrs. Sowerby . Poor woman . How mortifying . How wrong . How unjust . . . It was the first time that her heart had opened fully to Ellie 's mother . She saw at last that she was something more than her own potential enemy . To understand that Mrs. Sowerby suffered was somehow to understand that she existed , had a life , had motives and reasons having nothing to do with frustrating and opposing Lucy Nelson . The fact was that she had never opposed her . The decision Ellie had made to stop seeing Lucy back in September had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do with any instructions she had receivedfrom her mother . Only now could Lucy see that during these past months Mrs. Sowerby had never been anything but kind to her . Her ways might be somewhat old-fashioned and her manner a little remote , but was that so bad ? What harm had she ever done Lucy ? My God , it was n't Mrs. Sowerby who had been small-minded , it had been Lucy herself ! She should be ashamed of herself for her suspicions . Even when she had appeared wearing one of Ellie 's cashmere sweaters , Mrs. Sowerby 's exasperation probably had to do entirely with Eleanor 's barely disguised condescension , and nothing to do with disapproval of Lucy for being covetous of her daughter 's clothes . She was a patient , gentle and sympathetic person  --  look at her treatment not only of Lucy , but of Roy . She alone , of his entire family , seemed to take his problems and dilemmas seriously ; she alone accorded him genuine respect . Who had the dignity , the self-possession of Mrs. Sowerby ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reward to be paid that dignity ? Was this how Julian Sowerby chose to express his respect and gratitude to a woman of such refinement and generosity ? Because she happened to have to wear special elasticized stockings ; because in her middle age she was tending toward heaviness ; because her hair had begun to turn to gray , was that sufficient cause for such a person to be deceived , disgraced , discarded by a philandering loud-mouthed little pig of a man ? Blondie ! CutiePie ! What a person ! What a disgusting cheat of a person !  |p135Yet  in her heart she had always known . That was the amazing part . What should Ellie do ? Tell her mother ? Tell her Uncle Lloyd ? Or should she speak directly to her father , so , as to spare her mother from ever knowing ? Yes , go to him ; and if he promises to end his associations with his women , promises never to resume with them again . . . Or perhaps first she ought to find out who the woman was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell her that she must break off relations with her father instantly , or risk exposure  --  even incarceration , if it turned out ( as it might ) that she was a prostitute who sold her services to men like Julian Sowerby . Or perhaps Ellie should keep her secret , bide her time , wait for the phone to ring again  --  and then lift the extension and instead of burying the truth in her pillow , instead of simply sitting like a ninny enduring his treachery , put an end to it once and for all : " This is Eleanor Sowerby . I am Julian Sowerby 's daughter . I should like to know your name , please . " All at once , air colder and fresher than any they had felt in months seemed to descend on the Sowerbys and their young guests . " Wow , " said Joe softly . In his excitement he sat straight up . " It 's fall . It 's really fall . " " Hey , let 's get this Princess in the house , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his cigar went waving over his head like some signal . " Good idea , " said Joe . He and Roy told Mrs. Sowerby that since it was the maid 's night off , the two of them would carry in all the dirty dishes . They made a big fuss about not letting her touch anything , and shooed her directly into the house . Mr. Sowerby began to fold up the chairs , and Roy began to whistle " Autumn Leaves " as he went around collecting the silverware . Joe , piling plates , was saying to him , " Do you realize , Big Roy-boy , that tomorrow at this time  --  " Suddenly Ellie was at Lucy 's side , whispering into her ear . " What ? " said Lucy. " ... forget everything . " " What do you mean ? "  | " I mean  --  never mind ! " " But . . . did n't it really happen ? " " Hey , my two colleens , " Julian called , using an Irish accent . " Enough giggling now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly across the lawn . Ellie shivered , pulled the afghan up over her hair , and started to run for the open door . Lucy hissed , " But , Ellie , what are you going to do ? " Ellie stopped . " I 'll  --  I 'll  --  " " What ? " " Oh , I 'll just go to Northwestern . " " But , " whispered Lucy , taking hold of her arm , " your mother ? " But now Roy and Joe rushed up from behind  --  " Coming through ! Hot stuff ! Watch it , ladies ! "  --  and anything further she said would have been overheard . And then Julian Sowerby suddenly had each of them by the arm , and , laughing , ran them into the house . The next day Joe left for Alabama , and then Ellie herself became desperately busy with shopping and packing , and was almost perpetually in the company of her mother  --  who still seemed to be innocent of what was happening behind her back . The few times they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a chance to open her mouth , before Ellie said , " Shhh , later , " or " Lucy , I think never mind , really , " and finally , " Look , I was all wrong . " " You were ? " " I misunderstood , I 'm sure , yes . " " But- " " Please , let me just get to college ! " By the time they parted they seemed hardly even to be friends any longer , if they ever had been . Ellie and her family drove off to Evanston on the second weekend in September , and on the Monday following , on a day that Lucy had encircled with five black rings on her calendar , she and Roy drove down with a carful of luggage to begin their schooling in Fort Kean.  |p137She  passed out twice in the second week of November , first in a booth in The Old Campus Coffee Shop , and the afternoon following , upon rising from her seat at the end of English class . At the student health center , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she told the doctor that she believed she might be suffering from anemia . Her skin had always been on the pale side , and in winter the tips of her toes and fingers went white and icy when it got very cold . After the examination she dressed and sat in a chair the doctor had pulled back for her in his office . He said that he did not believe the problem was with the circulation in her extremities . Looking out the window , he asked if she had been having any trouble lately with her periods . She said no , then she said yes , and then , clutching her coat and her books in her arms , she rushed out the door . In the narrow corridor she felt herself spinning , but this time the sensation lasted only a second . As soon as she pulled shut the door of the phone booth in the coffee shop she realized that Roy would be in class . His landlady , Mrs. Blodgett , answered , and Lucy hung up without even speaking . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a phone ; but what would she say to him ? Thep138strange sensation she began to have  --  as the first wave of confusion gave way to a second , even more severe  --  was that it did not have anything to do with him anyway . She found herself thinking like a child who does not know the facts of life , who thinks that pregnancy is something that a woman does to herself , or that simply happens to her if she wishes hard enough . In her room she looked at all the ridiculous markings on her calendar . Just the previous Saturday , after Roy had driven her back to the dormitory from the movies , she had drawn a thick black ring around Thanksgiving Day . Suddenly she felt dreadful ; she went and stood with her mouth open over the toilet , but all she could cough up were some brownish strands of liquid . The dread remained . That evening she did not answer when the on-duty girl rapped on the door to her room and said that a Roy was on the phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drifting down to the dining hall or running off to class , Lucy rushed back to the infirmary . She had to wait on a bench in the corridor until ten , when the doctor finally arrived . " I was here yesterday , " she said . " Lucy Nelson . " " Come in . Sit down . " Before she began to speak he came around to the door and pushed it shut all the way . When he returned to his desk , she told him that she did not want a baby . He pushed his chair back a little and crossed one leg over the other . That was all he did . " Doctor , I 'm a freshman . A first-semester freshman . " He said nothing . " I 've been working for years to go to college . At night . In a soda fountain . Up in Liberty Center . That 's where I 'm from ... And summers too  --  three whole summers . And I have a Living Aid Scholarship . If I had n't gotten in here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school at all  --  because of money . " But she did not want to plead poverty , or even helplessness . What he had to know was that she was not weak , she wasp139strong , she had undergone many hardships , and much suffering  --  shewas n't just another eighteen-year-old girl . It was n't merely that she needed his help ; she deserved it . " This is my first real experience away from home , Doctor . I 've been waiting for it all my life . Saving for it . It 's all I 've had to look forward to for years . " He continued to listen . " Doctor , I 'm not promiscuous , I swear it . I 'm just eighteen ! You 've got to believe me ! " Until then the doctor had sat there with his glasses pushed up on his forehead . Now he adjusted the spectacles down onto the bridge of his nose . " I do n't know what to do , " she said , trying to regain her selfcontrol . His face remained immobile . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only scratched the side of his nose . " I do n't know what to do , " she said again . " I really do n't . " He crossed his arms . He rocked a little in his chair . " Doctor , I never had a boy friend before . He was my first one . That 's the truth  --  it really is . " The doctor swung the chair around and looked out the window , toward " The Bastille , " as the girls called the main building . He had pushed his glasses up again , and now he began rubbing at his eyes . Maybe he had been out on an emergency all night and was tired . Maybe he was thinking of what to say . Maybe he was n't even listening . He came out to the school four mornings a week for two hours , so what did he care ? He had a practice of his own to worry about ; this was just so much extra cash . Maybe he was only letting time pass before he sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned back to her . " And where is the young man ? " he asked . " ... Here . " " Speak up , Lucy . Where ? " She felt herself becoming meek . Or was it protective ? " In Fort Kean . " " And now that he 's had his fun , that 's it , I suppose . "  | " What ? " she whispered . He was rubbing at his temples with the tips of his fingers . He was thinking . He was going to help ! " Do n't you girls know what they 're up to ? " he asked in a soft and unhappy voice . " Ca n't you imagine what they 'll be like when something like this happens ? A bright and pretty little girl like you , Lucy . What were you thinking about ? " Her eyes welled with tears at the sound of her name . It might have been the first time she had ever heard it spoken . I 'm Lucy . I 'm bright . I 'm pretty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much had happened to her in the last year alone  --  in the last month . Already there was a girl on her floor who knew a boy she wanted to fix Lucy up with . Only there had never once been an opportunity to meet him , what with Roy coming around every single night , if only to stop off and say hello . She was away from home at long long last  --  and starting to be pretty ! Why , why had she gotten involved with him to begin with ? Because he called her Angel ? Because he took those pictures ? Because he sang all those stupid songs into her ear ? That big goon had n't the faintest idea what she was all about . All summer long he 'd acted as though she were some kind of girl she was n't  --  as though she were some sort of Monkey Littlefield . And she had let him . She had let him have his stupid way ! And now this ! Only , this was what happened to farm girls , to girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran away from home . To Babs Egan , but not to her . Had n't enough happened to her already ? " Doctor , I do n't know what I was thinking about . " She began to cry , despite herself . " All I mean is , lately I do n't even know what I 'm doing sometimes . " She covered her face with her fingers . " And what about the boy ? " " The boy ? " she said helplessly , rubbing her tears away . " What does he plan to do about all this ? Run off to the South Seas ? " " Oh no , " she moaned , sadder than ever , " no , he 'd marry me tomorrow , " and an instant too late she realized that she hadp141said the wrong thing . It was the truth , but it was the wrong thing to have said . " But you do n't want to . " The doctor was speaking to her . She looked up from her lap , partly . " I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it straight , Lucy . Just as it is . He wants to , but you do n't want to . " She rose from her seat . " But I 'm not even here three whole months ! I 'm a first-semester freshman ! " He was moving his glasses up again . He had such a big , wrinkled , friendly face  --  you just knew he had a family he loved , and a nice house , and a calm and pleasant life . " If the young man wants to marry you  --  " " What of it ? What if he does ? " " Well , I think that 's something that must at least be taken into consideration . Do n't you ? " Blankly she said , " I do n't understand . " And she did n't . " His feelings are something that have to be taken into consideration . His love for you . " Dumbly she sat there shaking her head . He did n't love her . He just sang those stupid songs into her ear. "  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " what he expects , too . " " But he does n't know what he wants . " " You say he wants to marry you . " " Oh , that is n't what I mean . He says things , but he does n't even know what ! Doctor  --  please , you 're right , I do n't want to marry him . I do n't want to lie to you . I hate liars and I do n't lie , and that 's the truth ! Please , hundreds and hundreds of girls do what I did . And they do it with all different people ! " " Perhaps they should n't . " " But I 'm not bad ! " She could n't help herself , it was the truth : " I 'm good ! " " Please , you must calm down . I did n't say that you were bad . I 'm sure you 're not . You must n't jump at everything I say before I finish saying it . " " I 'm sorry . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They should n't , " he began again , " because most of them are n't old enough to pay the price if they lose . If they get into trouble . " " But  --  " " But , " his voice rose over hers , " they 're old enough to want the love . I know . " The tears moved again into her eyes . " You do understand . Because that 's what happened to me , just what you said . That 's exactly it . " " Lucy , listen to me  --  " " I am , Doctor . Because that is what happened  --  " " Lucy , you 're not alone in this . " At first she thought he meant that there were other girls in school in the same fix  --  perhaps even in the infirmary rooms along the corridor beyond his office . " There is a young man , " the doctor said . " But  --  " " Listen to me , Lucy . There is a young man , and there is your family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " She looked into her plaid skirt , where her fingers were clutched at the big safety pin . " You do have a family ? " " Yes . I suppose . " " I think you have to forget your embarrassment and take this problem to your family . " " I ca n't . " " Why not ? " " I have a terrible family . " " Lucy , you 're not the first eighteen-year-old girl to think her family is terrible . Surely you 've discovered that since you 've been at school . " " But my family is terrible . I do n't think it  --  it 's true ! " He said nothing . " I ignore them . I have nothing to do with them . They 're inferior , Doctor , " she added when he still did n't seem to believe her . " In what way ? "  | " My father drinks . " She looked him straight in the eye . " He 's a drunkard . " " I see , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeping again . " She 's too good for him . " " That does n't sound inferior , " the doctor said quietly . " Yes , but she should have left him years and years ago , if she had any sense . Any self-respect . She should have found a man who would be good to her and respect her . " Like you , she thought . If you had met my mother , if she had married you . . . She heard herself saying , " Some people think , someonesaid once , she looks like Jennifer Jones . The actress . " He handed her a tissue and she blew her nose . She must n't ask to be pitied ; she must n't whimper ; she must n't fall to pieces . That 's what her mother would do . " Lucy , I think you should go home . Today . Maybe she understands more than you imagine . Maybe she wo n't be angry . I would think from what you say that she would n't be . " She did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . That 's exactly what he was beginning to do . " You seem to love her . Probably she loves you too . " " But she ca n't help , Doctor . Love has nothing to do with it . Love is what 's wrong with her . She 's so weak . She 's so insipid ! " " My dear , because you 're upset now  --  " " But , Doctor , they ca n't help ! Only you can help , " she said , standing . " You must ! " He shook his head . " But I ca n't , I 'm afraid . " " But you have to ! " " I 'm terribly sorry . " Could he mean it ? Could he understand the situation as he did , and then turn around and say he was n't going to help ? " But this is n't fair ! " she cried . The doctor nodded his head . " It is n't . " " So then what are you going to do about it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being wise to me ? Call me my dear ' ! " Instantly she sat back down in her chair . " Oh , I 'm sorry . I did n't mean that . But why are you . . . ? I mean ,  |p144you  see what happened . You understand . " She felt now that she had to plead with him , to convince him that he was right . " You do understand , Doctor . Please , you 're an intelligent person ! " " But there are limits . On all of us . People may want things , that does n't mean that we can give them . " " Please , " she said angrily , " do n't tell me what I know in that tone . I am not a child . " A moment passed . He stood . " But what 's going to happen to me ? If you do n't help . . . " He came around to the side of his desk . " Do n't you care ? " she asked . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she sensed his impatience . Then he spoke . " You can not expect me , young lady , to save your life . " She rose ; she faced him where he was standing at the door . " Please do not lecture me in that superior tone ! I refuse to belectured to by a perfect stranger who does n't know the firstthing about all I have had to put up with in my life . I am notjust another eighteen-year-old girl , and I wo n't take yourlectures ! " " And what will you take instead ? " he said sourly . " What ? " " I 'm asking what you expect , Lucy . You 're interesting , " he said , " in your expectations . You 're perfectly right  --  you are not just another eighteen-year-old girl . " He opened the door . " But what about my life ? How can you be so cruel to me ! " " I hope you come upon someone you can listen to " was his answer . " Well , I wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That would be too bad . " " Oh , " she said , buttoning her coat , " oh , I hope  --  I hope you 're happy , Doctor , when you go home to your nice house . I hope you 're happy with all your wisdom and your glasses and your doctor 's degree  --  and being a coward ! " " Goodbye , " he said , blinking only once . " Good luck . " " Oh , I wo n't rely on luck , Doctor . Or on people either . " " On what , then ? "  | " Myself ! " she said , and marched through the open door . " Good luck , " he said softly as she brushed by him , and then shut the door behind her . " You coward , " she moaned as she went rushing off to the coffee shop ; " you weakling , " she wept as she carried the phone book into the booth at the back of the store ; " you selfish , heartless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list of physicians in the yellow pages of the directory , imagining them one after another saying to her , " You can not expect me , young lady , to save your life , " and seeing herself dragging from one office to another , humiliated , ignored and abused . On Thanksgiving Day they all sat down to the turkey and she told her family that she and Roy Bassart had decided to get married . " What ? " her father said . She repeated herself . " Why ? " he demanded to know , and slammed down the carvinginstruments . " Because we want to . " Within five minutes the only one still at the table was her grandmother . She alone ate right through to the mince pie while overhead various members of the family , in various ways , tried to get Lucy to unlock her door . Berta , however , said she was sick and tired of disorder and tragedy , and refused to allow every single pleasant moment to be destroyed by one person or another , year in and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She came out of her bedroom to take the call , but would not speak until the kitchen was cleared of adults . Roy said that he could n't get away to see her before nine . But what had they said when he told them ? Nothing . He had n't told them yet . At nine-thirty he telephoned from the Sowerbys ' , saying that he had decided to wait until he was back in his own house , alone with his parents , before he broke the news . " Well , when will that be , Roy ? " " I do n't know exactly . Well , how can I know exactly ? Later . " But he was the one who had wanted to call them a week ago from Fort Kean ; he was the one , she said , who had thought there was nothing that wrong with having top146get married , so long as you were a couple who was going to marry anyway , probably , sooner or later . He was the one  --  " Here , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Roy ! " . " Hi , " Ellie said . " Hi , Lucy . Sorry about not writing . " " Hello , Eleanor . " " It 's just been work , work , work . You can imagine . I 'm going crazy in this science course . Hey , we 're all rolling on the floor listening to Roy 's adventures in that Britannia school . What a place ! And I 'm actually drinking . Hey , come over . " " I have to stay home . " " I hope it 's not hard feelings , or anything , about not writing . . . Is it ? " " No . " " Well , I 'll see you tomorrow . Have I got things to tell you . I 've met somebody marvelous , " Ellie whispered . " I almost sent you his picture . I mean , he 's perfect . " At midnight she came out of her bedroom to call Roy at his home . " Did you tell them ? " " Listen , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did n't you tell them ? " " It was too late . " " But I told mine ! " " Look , my father 's shouting down the stairs asking who it is . " Well , tell him ! " " Will you please stop instructing me on what to do every minute ? " he said . " I 'll do it when I 'm  --  " Suddenly he hung up . She dialed again . Mr. Bassart picked up the phone . " Just who is this ? " he asked . She did n't breathe . " Look , no pranks at this hour , whoever you are . If it 's one of you boys in my fifth-period class , do n't think I 'm not going to find out who . " In the morning she telephoned again . " I was going to call you , " Roy said . " Roy , when are you going to tell them ? "  | " It 's only eight in the morning . We have n't had breakfast , even . My Aunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell them . " " Who said that ? " " That 's why your aunt 's coming to your house ! " " How can you say that ? How do you know that 's even true ? " " Roy , what are you hiding from me ? " " Nothing . Ca n't you just let things settle for a few hours ? My God . " " Why is your aunt coming over at eight o'clock in the morning ? Who even called her ? " " Oh , look , okay , " he said suddenly , " if you have to know  --  " " I do ! Know what ! " " Well , my father wants me to wait till June . " " Then you did tell them ! " " . . . When we came home . " " Then why did n't you say that last night ! " " Because it just so happened that I wanted to give you good news , Lucy , not bad . I was trying to spare you , Lucy , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " Timetable ? Roy , what are you talking about ? How can we wait until June ! " " But he does n't know about that ! " " And do n't you tell him either , Roy ! " " I have to hang up . She 's here . " At noon he called to say that he was n't driving back to Fort Kean until Monday , so perhaps she had better plan to take the bus down on Sunday night . " I 'm calling from a booth , Lucy . I 'm on my way to Mr. Brunn 's to pick up something for my father . I have to hurry  --  " " Roy , please explain instantly what this means . " " I 'm trying to take care of some things and iron them out , all right ? Do you mind ? " " Roy ! You ca n't do this ! I have to see you , right now ! " " I 'm hanging up , Lucy . " " No ! "  | " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " If you hang up , I 'm coming over to your house this minute . Hello ? Do you hear me ? " But the line had been disconnected . She called Eleanor 's house . " Ellie , it 's Lucy . I have to talk to you . " " Why ? " " Oh , not you too ? " " ... Me too , what ? " " Ellie , you had to talk to me once  --  now I have to talk to you . I have to know what 's going on , Ellie . I 'll come right over . " " Now ? Lucy , you better not  --  right now , I mean . " " Is anybody home ? " " No . But they 're all  --  going crazy . " " Why ? " " Well , Roy says you want to marry him . " " He wants to marry me ! Did n't he say that ? " " Well , yes . . . Well , sort of . He says he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they think you 're making him  --  Uh-oh , somebody 's pulling into the driveway . Everybody 's been drivingback and forth all morning . . Lucy ? " " Yes . " " . . . Are you ? " " What ? " " Well , making him . " " No ! " " Then  --  why ? " " Because we want to ! " " You do ? " " Yes ! " " But  --  " " But what , Eleanor ! " " Well . . . you 're so young . We all are . I mean , it 's a surprise . I guess I just do n't know what I mean , really . " " Because you 're a dope , Ellie ! Because you 're a stupid , insipid , self-centered , selfish dope ! "  |p149In  the early evening she took a bus back to Fort Kean . The doors to The Bastille were chained shut , and she had to walk all around the cold campus before she found the watchman . He led her over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat her down in a chair , and took out his spectacles to look for her name in the student directory . And all those names printed in the register made her think : Run away . Who would ever find her ? In her room she beat her fists on the pillow , on the headboard , on the wall . It was awful . It was horrible . Every other college girl in America was home right now , having a good time with her friends and her family . Yet her mother had begged , her grandfather had begged , even her father had asked her to stay . They said that it was just that they were stunned by the news . Would n't she agree , they reasoned through the door , that it was a little unexpected ? They would try to get used to it , if only she would n't run off like this on a holiday weekend . They were shocked at first , and had maybe lost their heads . It was , after all , only the first semester of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long . But probably she knew what she was doing , if her mind was made up the way it sounded that it was . So would n't she stay through Monday ? When she was fifteen years old and on her own decided on Catholic as her religious preference , had they stood in her way ? No , she had insisted that it was what she wanted , and they had decided to let her go ahead . And later , when she had changed her mind , and turned back to Presbyterian again , well , that too had been her own decision , made on her own , without interferencefrom any person in the family . And the same with the snare drum . Another decision made on her own , that they had honored and respected , until finally she decided to give that up too . Of course they were n't meaning to draw any comparison between taking up the snare drum and taking a husband for life ; but their attitude had been that if she preferred beating the drums to resuming piano ( which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her own decision once again ) , or begin/ping something like accordion , which had been Daddy Will 's compromise suggestion , they had no choice but to let her have her way . Their house was not a dictatorship ; it was a democracy , in which every person had his ideas  --  and was respected for them too . " I may not believe what you say , " said Daddy Will through the door , " but I will fight for your right to say it . " So would n't she reconsider and not rush off now to some lonely , empty school ? Why did n't she stay and talk it over ? After all , Grandma had been baking all week , and for her . " For Thanksgiving , " said Lucy . " Well , honey , that 's not much different , when you think about it . It 's your first big weekend home from college , there is n't one of us does n't realize .. . Lucy ? Are you listening to me ? " But what about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monumental tragedy ? Since when did anything having to do with her sacrifices , her suffering , bring tears to his eyes ? She could not bear the pretense . And who said she was quitting college ? He kept wandering around the house , crying , " I wanted her to go to college , " but who had said she was n't ? All she had said was that she was getting married to Roy .. . Or did they know why without her explaining further ? Were they content to accept what she told them , simply to avoid the humiliation of confronting the truth ? She picked up her French grammar and threw it clear across the room . " They do n't even know , " she said aloud , " and still they 're letting me do it ! " If only they 'd say no . NO , LUCY , YOU CAN NOT . NO , LUCY , WE FORBID IT . But it seemed that none of them had the conviction any longer , or the endurance , to go against a choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set her will against theirs long ago  --  it was the battle of her adolescence , but it was over now . And she had won . She could do whatever in the world she wanted  --  even marry someone she secretly despised . When Roy returned to Fort Kean on Monday evening , and switched on the light in his room , he found Lucy sitting in a chair by the window.  | " What are you doing here ? " he cried , dropping his suitcase . " The shades are up ! " " Then pull them down , Roy . " Instantly he did . " How did you get inside ? " " How do I always get inside , Roy ? On all fours . " " Is she home ? " " Who ? " " My landlady ! " he whispered , and without another word , slipped out the door and into the hallway . She heard him whistling his way up the stairs and into the bathroom . You sigh , the song begins , you speak and I hear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then he was sliding into the room again . " She 's out , " he said , shutting the door . " We better turn off the lights . " " So you wo n't have to look at me ? " " So she does n't find you here , if she comes home . Well , she just might come home . Well , what 's the matter with you ? " She rose and clutched her stomach . " Take a guess ! " " Shhhh . " " But she 's out . " " But she 'll be back ! We always have the lights out , Lucy . " ' " But I want to talk to you , and face to face , not on a phone , Roy , where you can  --  " " Well , I 'm sorry , but the lights are going off . So get ready . " " But are we getting married or are n't we ? Tell me , so Iknow what to do next , or where to go , or God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me take my coat off , will you , please ? " " Roy , yes or no . " " Well , how can I give you a yes or no answer when it 's not a yes or no question ? " " But that 's exactly what it is . " " Will you calm down ? I 've been driving for two hours . " While he was hanging his coat in the closet , she came up behind him and stood on her toes . " Yes or no , Roy ! " up toward his ear , which was still a foot above her . He ducked away from her . " Now , first , I 'm turning thep152lights off . Just to be safe . Well , look , Lucy , I agreed when I rented here not to have girls in my room . " " But you had me , Roy , and plenty . " " But she does n't know about it ! Oh , darn it . Here go the lights , " and without pausing to hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now you do n't have to look at me , Roy . Tell me what happened over your long Thanksgiving holiday . While I was down here in an empty dormitory all by myself for two whole days . " " First off , I did n't tell you to go back to any empty dorm . Second , I 'm going to sit down , if you do n't mind . And why do n't you sit , too ? " " I 'll stand , thank you . " " In the dark ? " " Yes ! " " Shhhh ! " " Begin , " she said . " Well , let me get settled . . . Okay . " " What ? " " I 've got them to come around part way . " " Continue . " " Oh , sit down , will you ? " " What 's the difference ? You ca n't see me . " " I do too see you ! Hanging over me . Sit down , please . " She had been waiting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was sleep . She lowered herself onto the edge of the bed and closed her eyes . Go to Mr. Valerio . Run away . But neither idea made sense . If she should see anyone , it was Father Damrosch . But what would he do ? That was precisely his trouble : he could n't do anything . He was about as much help as Saint Teresa , or Jesus Christ . He looked so strong , and listened to everything she said , and said such beautiful things himself . . . but it was n't beautiful things she needed to hear . Something had to be done . " First off , " he was saying , " do n't think it was easy for me . It was hell , actually . "  | " What was ? " " Pretending you were n't pregnant , Lucy , when everybody kept asking me over and over again why ? " " And did you tell them ? " " No . " " Are you sure ? " " Yes ! Shhhhh ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , you make me . " " You might be shouting because you 're lying , Roy . " " I did not tell them , Lucy ! Will you stop accusing ? Actually , I keep wondering why I do n't . Why ca n't I just speak the simple truth ? If we 're going to be married anyway . " " Are we ? " " Well , we would be . . . if I told them , I mean . " " You mean if you do n't , we 're not ? " " Well , that 's the point . That 's what 's so confused . I mean , they had so many arguments for why we should at least wait until June . " " And ? " " And , well , they 're all good arguments . I mean , it 's just hard to argue against a good argument , that 's all . " " So you said you 'd wait . " " I said I 'd think about it . " " But how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get out of the house , did n't I ? I 've missed a whole day of school already . " " You have a car , you can drive  --  " " But I could n't leave it the way it was ! Do n't you understand anything ! " " Why could n't you ? Why did n't you ? " " Why should they all be furious at me , Lucy , and so confused about everything ? I 'm not doing anything wrong . The opposite , in fact , the very opposite ! Why do n't we just tell the truth ? I do n't have to lie to my parents , you know . " " I do n't have to lie to mine either , Roy , if that 's what you mean . " " But you are . "  | " Because I want to ! " " Why ? " " Oh , why wo n't you be a man about this ! Why are you acting this way ! " " But you 're the one who 's hiding the simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " Roy , do you honestly believe they will all love and adore me when they hear that I 'm going to have a baby ? " " They 'd understand is all I 'm saying . " " But only two people have to understand  --  you and me . " " Well , maybe that 's all you think . . . with your family . " " And what 's wrong with my family that is n't with yours , Roy ? Look , you , if you do n't want to marry me , " she said , " because someone has begun to tell you that I 'm not good enough for you , well , believe me , you do n't have to . " A moment passed . And another . " But I do want to , " he said at last . " Roy , I think you really do n't . " She buried her head in her hands . " That 's the truth , is n't it ? Trust me , trust me '  --  and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . no . . . Well , you certainly have n't been actingthese last few days like the kind of person someone would like living in the same house with particularly I 'll tell you that . . . Suddenly you 're so  --  " " So what ? Lower class ? " " No , " he said . " No . Cold . " " Oh , am I ? " " Well , sort of , recently , yes , as a matter of fact . " " And what else am I ? " " Well , all kidding aside , Lucy , you 're just acting so angry . " " You might be a little angry too , if you had agreed beforehandwith someone  --  " " But I do n't mean normal angry ! " " What ? " " Well  --  practically crazy ! " " You honestly think because I 'm angry I 'm insane ? " " I did n't say I did . I did n't say insane . "  | " Who did say it then ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe , " she said after a moment , " you make me insane , Roy Bassart . " " Then why do you want to marry me so much ? " " I do n't want to ! " " Oh , then do n't do me the favor , you know . " " I do n't think I will , " she said . " Because that 's really what it would be . " " Oh , sure . And what will you do instead ? Marry somebody else ? " " Do you know something , you ? I 've been getting rid of you since July , Roy . Since the day you took this room because it had a long bed in it , you  --  you baby ! " " Well , you sure are a slow worker , I 'll say that for you . " " I 'm not slow ! I have sympathy for you ! I felt sorry for you . " " Oh , sure . " " I was afraid you 'd give up photography if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it , Roy  --  on Thanksgiving Day of all days , and I would have , too , if I did n't have to marry you instead . " " Oh , do n't feel you have to , you know . " " I thought when you collapsed , at least you 'd be in Liberty Center , where you could go eat your Hydrox cookies . " " Well , do n't worry about my crying , if I can put in my two cents . I do n't cry that easy , for one thing . And as for Hydrox cookies , that 's irrelevant to anything . I do n't even know what it 's supposed to mean , in fact . Besides , " he said , " if you wanted to drop somebody , do n't worry , you 'd drop him . You would n't bother too much about their crying either . " " No ? " " . . . Because you do n't have emotions like other people . " " Do n't I ? And who said that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , no . I do n't have emotions like other people . I 'm a piece of pure stone . " " You are crying . " He came over to the bed , where she was stretched out , her face still in her hands . " Do n't . Please , I did n't mean it . Really . " " Roy , " she said , " who said I was insane to you ? Who said I did n't have emotions ? " " Ordinary emotions . Nobody . " " Who was it , Roy ? Your Uncle Julian ? " " No . Nobody . " " And you believed him . " " I did n't . He did n't say it ! " " But I could tell you about him too ! Tell you plenty . The way your Uncle Julian looks at me ! How he kissed me at your party ! " " This summer , you mean ? But that was a joke . You kissed him back . Lucy , what are you even saying ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're blind to how awful people are ! How rotten and hateful they are ! They tell you I 'm lower class and do n't have ordinary emotions , and you believe them ! " " I do n't ! " " And all on the basis of what ? Why , Roy ? Say it ! " " Say what ? " " My father ! But I did n't put him in jail , Roy ! " " I did n't say you did . " " He put himself there ! That was years ago , and it 's over , and I am not beneath you or them , or anyone ! " The door opened ; the light went on over their heads . In the doorway stood the widow from whom Roy rented his room : Mrs. Blodgett , a thin , nervous and alert woman with a little coin-slot mouth and a great capacity for expressingdisapproval by merely reducing the thing in size . She did not speak right off ; she did not have to . " Well , just how did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though he were the one who was outraged . He had moved instantly between Lucy and the landlady . " Well , how , Mrs. Blodgett ? "  | " With a key , Mr. Bassart . How did she is a better question . Stand up , you hussy . " " Roy , " whispered Lucy . But he continued to hide her behind him . " I said get up from that bed , " said Mrs. Blodgett . " And get out . " But Roy was intent upon making his point . " You 're not supposed to use a key in another person 's door , for one thing , you know . " " Do n't tell me the things I 'm not supposed to do , Mr. Bassart . I thought you were an Army veteran , or so you said . " " But  --  " " But what , sir ? But you do n't know the rules of this house , is that what you 're going to have the gall to tell me ? " " You do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Well , if you 'd calm down , I 'll tell you . " " You just tell me , whether I 'm calmed down or not , which I happen to be anyway . I 've had others like you , Mr. Bassart . One in 1937 , and another right on his heels in 1938 . They look all right , but the looks is about the whole of it . Underneath they 're all the same . " Her mouth became invisible . " Crooked , " she said . " But this is different , " said Roy . " She 's my fiancee . " " Who is ? You just let her out , so I can see her . " " Roy , " Lucy pleaded . " Move . " At last he did , smiling all the while . " This is Mrs. Blodgett , my landlady , who I mentioned to you . Mrs. Blodgett "  --  he rubbed his hands together , as though he had been awaiting this pleasure for a long time  --  " this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lucy stood , her skirt finally covering her knees . " Why were the lights off and all that shouting ? " asked Mrs. Blodgett . " Shouting ? " said Roy , looking around . " We were listening to music . You know I love music , Mrs. Blodgett. "  |p158Mrs  . Blodgett looked at him in such a way as to openly admit to skepticism . " The radio , " he said . " We just turned it off . That was the noise , I guess . We just drove down from home . We were resting . Our eyes . That 's how come the lights were dim . " " Off , " said the tiny mouth , disappearing . " Anyway , " said Roy , " there 's my suitcase . We did just get back . " " Who gave you permission , young man , to bring girls into my house against the rules ? This is a dwelling place . I told you that when you first arrived , did I not ? " " Well , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought since she was my fiancee , you would n't mind if we rested . " He smiled . " Against the rules . " No answer . " Since we 're getting married . " " When ? " " Christmas , " he announced . " Is that so ? " Lucy was the one being asked . " It 's the truth , Mrs. Blodgett , " said Roy . " That 's why we came down late from home . Making plans , " he said with another big smile ; then he turned somber and penitent . " I may have broken a rule about bringing Lucy in here , and if I did , I 'm sorry . " " There are no ifs about it , " said Mrs. Blodgett . " Not that I can see . " " Well then , I 'm sorry then . " " Lucy what ? " asked the landlady . " What 's your last name , you ? " " Nelson . " " And where are you from ? " " The women 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you marrying him , or are you just some girl ? " " I 'm marrying him . " Roy raised his hands . " See ? "  | " Well , " said Mrs. Blodgett , " she could be lying . That 's not unheard of . " " Does she look like a liar ? " asked Roy , putting his hands in his pockets and shuffling over toward Lucy . " With this face ? Come on , Mrs. Blodgett , " he said winningly . " She 's the girl next door . Actually , she practically is , you know . " The landlady did not smile back . " I had a boy in 1945 who had a fiancee . But he came to me , Mr. Bassart  --  " " Yes ? " "  --  and told me his plans . And then brought the young lady around on a Sunday to be properly introduced . " " A Sunday . Well , that 's a good idea , all right . " " Let me finish , please . We then arranged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evening . I did not even have to make it clear that the door to the room was to be left open . He understood that much . " " I see , " said Roy with considerable interest . " Miss Nelson , I am not a close-minded person , but where I have my rules I am strict . This happens to be my dwelling place , and not some fly-by-night person 's hotel . Without rules it would go to rack and ruin inside of a month . Maybe you 'll understand how that happens when you 're older . I certainly hope you do , for your sake . " " Oh , we understand now , " said Roy . " Do n't ever try to trick me again , Mr. Bassart . " " Oh , now that I know the ten o'clock setup  --  " " And I know your name , young lady . Lucy Nelson . S-o-n or s-e-n ? " " S-o-n . " " And I know the dean over at your school . Miss Pardee , correct ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then do n't you ever try to trick me either . " She started for the door . " So then , " said Roy , following her , " at least we 're all squared away , anyway . " When Mrs. Blodgett turned to show him what she thoughtp160of that last remark , Roy smiled . " I mean , we 're all forgiven and everything , right ? I know innocence of the law is no  --  " " You are not innocent , Mr. Bassart . My back was turned . You are guilty as sin . " " Well , I suppose in a manner of speaking . . . " And he shrugged . " Now the rules , Mrs. Blodgett  --  just so I 'm sure I 've got them straight . " " So long , sir , as the door is left open  --  " " Oh , absolutely , wide open . " " So long as she is out of here at ten o'clock  --  " " Oh , out she 'll be , " said Roy , laughing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That was music , Mrs. Blodgett , really  --  " " And so long , Mr. Bassart , as there is a marriage , Christmas Day . " For a moment he looked dumfounded . Marriage ? " Oh , sure . Good day , do n't you think ? Christmas ? " Mrs. Blodgett went out , leaving the door ajar . " Bye , " said Roy , and waited until he heard the door to the back parlor being closed before he fell into a chair . " Wow . " " Then we are getting married , " said Lucy . " Shhhhh ! "  --  rising up out of the chair . " Will you  --  yes , " he said all at once , for the parlor door had opened , and Mrs. Blodgett was headed back to the stairs . " Mom and Dad feel  --  oh , hi , Mrs. Blodgett . " He tipped an imaginary hat . " Have a nice sleep now . " " It is nine forty-eight , Mr. Bassart . " Roy looked at his watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for reminding me . Just finishing up talking over our plans . Night , now . " She started up the stairs , her anger not much abated , it seemed . " Roy  --  " Lucy began , but in two steps he was at her side ; one hand he pressed to the back of her head , the other to her mouth . " So , " he said loudly , " Mom and Dad felt that for the most part your suggestion  --  "  |p161Her  eyes stared wildly at him , until the bedroom door could be heard closing overhead . He took his wet hand from her lips . " Do n't you ever  --  ever  --  " she said , so enraged that she could hardly speak , " do that again ! " " Oh , golly , " he said , and threw himself backward onto his bed . " I 'm actually going off my rocker with you ! What do you expect , when she was on the stairs , Lucy ? " " I expect  --  ! " " Shhhhh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 're getting married ! " he whispered hoarsely . " So shut up . " She was suddenly and completely baffled . She was getting married . " When ? " " Christmas ! Okay ? Now will you stop ? " " And your family ? " " Well , what about them ? " " You have to tell them . " " I will , I will . But just lay off for a while . " " Roy . . . it has to be now . " " Now ? " he said . " Yes ! " " But my mother is in bed , and quiet down ! " After a moment he said , " Well , she is . I 'm not lying . She goes to bed at nine and gets up at five-thirty . Do n't ask me why . That 's how she does it , Lucy , and how she 's always done it , and there 's nothing I can do to change her at this stage of the game . Well , that 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it for tonight , really . " " But you must make this official . You just ca n't keep me living this way . It 's a nightmare ! " " But I 'll make it official when I think it should be ! " " Roy , suppose she calls Dean Pardee ! I do n't want to be thrown out of school ! I do n't need that in my one life , too . " " Well , " he said , smacking the sides of his head , " I do n't want to be thrown out either , you know . Why else do you think I told her what I did ? " " Then it is a lie and you do n't mean it again ! "  | " It 's not ! I do ! I always have ! " " Roy Bassart , call your parents , or I 'll do something ! " He jumped out of the bed . " No ! " " Keep your hands away from my mouth , Roy ! " " Do n't scream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " But I am pregnant with a human baby ! " she cried . " I 'm going to have your baby , Roy ! And you wo n't even do your duty ! " " I will ! I am ! " " When ? " " Now ! Okay ? Now ! But do n't scream , Lucy , do n't throw a stupid fit ! " " Then call ! " " But , " he said , " what I told Mrs. Blodgett  --  I had to . " " Roy ! " " Okay , " and he ran from the room . In a few minutes he returned , paler than she had ever seen him . Where the hair was clipped short at his neck , she could see his white skin . " I did it , " he said . And she believed him . Even his wrists and hands were white . " I did it , " he mumbled . " And I told you , did n't I ? I told you she 'd be sleeping . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get her out of bed . Well , did n't I ? I was n't lying ! And I would n't be thrown out of school . Why did I say that ! I 'd only be thrown out of this room  --  and what difference does that make anyway ? Nobody else cares about my self-respect anyway , so why should I worry about it ? He does n't worry about it ! She does n't worry about it ! And you  --  you were going to scream ! My self-respect , oh , the heck with that , all you want to do is scream and confuse people . That 's your way , Lucy  --  to confuse people . Everybody 's way . Confuse Roy  --  why not ? Who 's he , anyway ? But that 's over ! Because I 'm not confused , Lucy , and from here on out that 's the way things are going to be . We 're getting married , you hear me  --  on Christmas Day . And if that does n't suit people , then the day after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upstairs . " Mr. Bassart , there is that shout/ing again ! That is not music , that is clear shouting , and it will not be tolerated ! " Roy stuck his head out into the hallway . " No , no , just saying good night to Lucy here , Mrs. Blodgett  --  finishing up the old wedding plans . " " Say it then ! Do n't shout it ! This is a dwelling place ! " She slammed her door shut . Lucy was crying . " Now what are the tears for ? " he asked . " Huh ? Now what hundred thousand things did I do wrong ? Really , you know , maybe I 've had just about enough complaining and criticizing of me , you know  --  from you included , too . So maybe you ought to stop , you know . Maybe you ought to have a little consideration for all I 've been through , and just stop , damn it ! " " Oh , " she said , " I 'll stop , Roy . Until you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother , I 'll make that bargain . Gladly . " Whereupon , to his surprise , she threw open the window , and out of anger , or spite , or habit left the room as she had entered it . Roy rushed into the hallway to the front door . Noisily he opened it  --  " Good night , " he called . " Good night , Lucy "  --  and noisily he closed it , so that upstairs Mrs. Blodgett would continue to believe that everything was really on the upand-up , even if a little too loud . Tuesday , Aunt Irene for lunch at the Hotel Thomas Kean . Wednesday , his mother and father for dinner at The Song of Norway . Thursday , Uncle Julian , a drink in the taproom of the Kean , lasting from five in the afternoon until nine in the evening . At nine-thirty Roy dropped into a sofa in the downstairs living room of The Bastille . The corner in which Lucy had chosen to wait for him was the darkest in the room . " And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't even eaten ! " " I have some crackers in my room , " she whispered . " They 're not going to treat me like this , " he said , glaringp164down his legs at the tips of his Army shoes . " I wo n't sit by and listen to threats , I 'll tell you that . " " ... Do you want me to get the crackers ? " " That is n't the point , Lucy ! The point is , pushing me around ! Thinking he could make me sit there ! Just make me , you know ? Well , I do n't need them that bad , I 'll tell you that . And I do n't want them either , not if they 're going to take this kind of attitude . What an attitude to take  --  to me ! To somebody they 're supposed to care about ! " He got up and walked to the window . Looking out at the quiet street , he banged a fist into his palm . " Boy ! " she heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her legs back under her skirt . It was a posture she had seen the other girls take while talking to their boy friends in the dormitory living room . If the house mother came into the living room , it would seem as though nothing unusual were going on . So far no one in the dorm knew anything ; no one was going to , either . In her two and a half months at school Roy had n't left her alone enough to make any close friends , and even those few girls she had begun to be friendly with on the floor , she had drawn away from now . " Look , " said Roy , coming back to the sofa , " I 've got the G.I. Bill , have n't I ? " " Yes . " " And I 've got savings still , right ? Other guys played cards , other guys shot crap  --  but I did n't . I was waiting to get out . So I saved ! Purposely . And they should know that ! I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listen . And if worst ever came to worst , I 'd sell the Hudson , too , even with all the work I put in it . Do you believe me , Lucy ? Because it 's true ! " " Yes . " Was this Roy ? Was this Lucy ? Was this them together ? " But they think money is everything . Do you know what he is , my Uncle Julian ? Maybe I 'm just finding out  --  but he 's a materialist . And what a vocabulary ! It 's worse than you even think it is . What respect for somebody else ! " " What did he say ? Roy , what kind of threats ? "  | " Oh , who cares . Money threats . And my father  --  him too . You know , by and large , whether he knew it or not , I used to respect him . But do you think he has any emotional respect for me , either ? He 's trying to treat me like I 'm in his printing class again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Army . Sixteen months in the Aleutian Islands  --  the backside of the whole goddamn world . But my uncle says  --  you know what he says ? But the war was over , buster , in 1945 . Do n't act like you fought it . ' See , he fought it . He won a medal . And what 's that have to do with anything anyway ? Nothing ! Oh  --  up his . " " Roy , " warned Lucy , as some senior girls came into the living room . " Well , " he said , plopping down next to her , " they 're always telling me I should speak up for myself , right ? Make a decision and stick to it , Roy . ' Is n't that all I heard since the day I got home ? Is n't my Uncle Julian always shooting off about how you have to be a go-getter in this world ? That 's his big defense of capitalism , you know . It makes a man out of you , instead of just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But what does he know about Socialism anyway ? You think the man has ever read a book about it in his life ? He thinks Socialism is Communism , and what you say does n't make any difference at all . None ! Well , I 'm young . And I 've got my health . And I sure do n't care one way or the other about ever being in the El-ene washing-machine business , I 'll tell you that much . Big threat that is . I 'm going to photography school anyway . And you know something else ? He does n't know right from wrong . That 's the real pay-off . That in this country , where people are still struggling , or unemployed , or do n't have the ordinary necessities that they give the people in just about any Scandinavian country you can name  --  that a man like that , without the slightest code of decency , can just bully his way , and the hell with right and wrong or somebody'sfeelings . Well , I 'm through being somebody he can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fourteen-dollar cigars . Up his , Lucy  --  really . " The next morning , when the alarm rang at six-thirty , she went off to the bathroom to stick a finger down her throatp166before the other girls started coming in to brush their teeth . This made her feel herself again , provided she skipped breakfastafterward , and avoided the corridor back of the dining hall , and forced soda crackers down herself from time to time during the morning . Then she could get through the day 's classes pretending that she was the same girl in the same body , and in the same way too  --  alone . But what about last night ? And the night before that ? The fainting spells had stopped two weeks back , and the nausea she could starve to death every morning , but now that Roy 's body seemed to be inhabited by some new person , the truth came in upon her as it never had before : a new person was inhabiting hers as well . She was stunned . Her predicament was real . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their senses . It was no scheme to force them to treat her like flesh and blood , like a human being , like a girl . And it was not going to disappear either , just because somebody besides herself was at long last taking it seriously . It was real ! Something was happening which she was helpless to stop ! Something was growing inside her body , and without her permission ! And I do n't want to marry him . The sun was n't even above the trees as she ran across Pendleton Park to downtown Fort Kean . She had to wait an hour in the station for the first bus to the north . Her books were in her lap ; she had some idea that she could study on the way up and be back for her two-thirty , but then she had not yet a clear idea of why she was suddenly rushing up to Liberty Center , or what would happen there . On the bench in the empty station she tried to calm herself by reading the English assignment she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and during lunch , which she did n't eat anyway . " Here you will have a chance to examine , and then practice , several skills used in writing effective sentences . The skills presented are those  --  " She did n't want to marry him ! He was the last person in the world she would ever want to marry !  |p167She  began gagging only a little way beyond Fort Kean . When he heard the sounds of her distress , the driver pulled to the side of the road . She dropped out the back door and threw her soiled handkerchief into a puddle . Aboard again , she sat in the rear corner praying that she would not be ill , or faint , or begin to sob . She must not think of food ; she must not even think of the crackers she had forgotten in her flight from the dorm ; she must not think of what she was going to say , or to whom . What was she going to say ? " Here you will have a chance to examine , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

" Lucy , what are you doing here ? What 's the matter ? " " I got here by bus , Mother . That 's how people get from Fort Kean to Liberty Center . Bus . "  | " But what is it ? Lucy , you 're so pale . " " Is anyone else home ? " she asked . Her mother shook her head . She had come running from the kitchen , carrying a small bowl in her hand ; now she had it thrust up to her chest . " Dear , your coloring  --  " " Where is everyone ? " " Daddy Will took Grandma over to the market in Winnisaw . " " And he went to work ? Your husband ? " " Lucy , what is it ? Why are n't you in school ?

" " To your father . " " Oh ? And what came of that , may I ask ? " " Well , he took your side . ' Well , that 's what came of it . Lucy , I 'm answering your question . He took your side and without a moment 's hesitation . Despite our not having been properly told by our own daughter , the day of her own wedding  --  " " What did he say , Mother ? Exactly .

I 'm going to have a baby and I hate Roy and I never want to marry him or see him again ! " She ran off to the kitchen just in time to be sick in the sink . She was put to bed in her room . " Here you will have a chance . . . " The book slid off the bed onto the floor . What was there to do now but wait ? The mail fell through the slot in the hallway and onto the welcome mat . The vacuum cleaner started up . The car pulled into the driveway . She heard her grandmother 's voice down on the front porch . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I told Grandma it was the grippe , " she whispered to her daughter . " Is that all right ? " Would her grandmother believe that she had come home because of the grippe ? Where was Daddy Will ? What had she told him ? " He did n't even come inside , Lucy . He 'll be back this afternoon . " " Does he know I 'm home ? " " Not yet . " Home . But why not ? For years they had complained that she acted contemptuous of everything they said or did ; for years they complained that she refused to let them give her a single word of advice ; she lived among them like a stranger , like an enemy even , unfriendly , uncommunicative , nearly unapproachable . Well , could they say she was behaving like their enemy today ? She had come home . So what were they going to do ? Alone , she drank some of the tea . She sank back into the pillow her mother had fluffed up for her and drew one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It smelled so nice . Forget everything else . Just wait . Time will pass . Eventually something will have to be done . She fell asleep with her face on her fingers . Her grandmother came up the stairs carrying a wet mustard plaster . The patient let her nightgown be unbuttoned . " That'llp170loosen it up , " said Grandma Berta , pressing it down . " The two important things , rest and heat . Plenty of heat . Much as you can possibly stand , " and she piled two blankets more onto the patient . Lucy closed her eyes . Why had n't she done this at the start ? Just gotten into bed and left it all to them . Was n't that what they were always wanting to be , her family ? She was awakened by the piano . The students had begun to arrive for their lessons . She thought , " But I do n't have the grippe ! " But then she drove the thought , and the panic that accompanied it , right from her mind . It must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blanket off the bed , wrapped it around her , and at the window , put her mouth on the cold glass and watched the cars sliding down the street . The window began to grow warm where her mouth was pressed against it . Breathing in and out , she could make the circle of steam on the glass expand and contract . She watched the snow fall . What would happen when her grandmother found out what really was wrong with her ? And her grandfather , when he got home ? And her father ! She had forgotten to tell her mother not to tell him . Maybe she would n't . But then would anything happen ? She scuffed with her slippers across the old worn rug and got back into her bed . She thought about picking up her Englishbook from the floor to work a little on those sentences ; insteadshe got way down under the blankets and with her faintly lemony fingers under her nose , slept for the sixth or seventh time . Beyond the window it was dark , though from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be seen floating down through the light of the street lamp across the street . Her father knocked on her door . He asked if he could come in . " ... It 's not locked " was her response . " Well , " he said , stepping into the room , " so this is how the rich spend their days . Not bad . "  |p171She  could tell that his words had been prepared . She did not look up from the blanket , but began to smooth it out with her hand . " I have the grippe . " " Smells to me , " he said , " like you 've been eating hot dogs . " She did not smile or speak . " I tell you what it smells like . Smells like Comiskey Park , down in Chicago . " " Mustard plaster , " she finally said . " Well , " he said , giving the door a push so that it closed , " that 's one of your grandmother 's real pleasures in life . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and the other is . . . No , I think that about covers it . " She only shrugged , as though she had no opinions on people 's habits , one way or the other . Was he clowning because he knew , or because he did n't know ? She saw from the corner of her eye that the pale hairs on the back of his hands were wet . He had washed before coming into her room . The smell of dinner cooking down below caused her to begin to feel ill . " Mind if I sit at the foot here ? " he said . " If you want to . " She must n't be sick , not again . She must n't arouse in him a single suspicion . No , she did not want him to know , ever ! " Let 's see , " he was saying . " Do I want to or do n't I want to ? I want to . " She yawned as he sat . " Well , " he said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead into the snowy evening . " Winter 's coming in with a rush this time , " he said . She glanced quickly over at him . " I suppose . " By looking instantly out the window , she was able to collect herself ; she could not remember the last time she had looked directly into his eyes . " Did I ever tell you , " he said , " about the time I sprained my ankle when I was working over at McConnell 's ? It swelled way up and I came home , and your grandmother just lit up all over . Hot compresses , she said . So I sat down in the kitchenp172and rolled up my trouser leg . You should have seen her boiling up the water on the stove . Somehow it reminded me of all those cannibals over in Africa . She ca n't see how it can be good for you unless it hurts or smells bad . " Suppose she just blurted out the truth , to him ? " A lot of people like that , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave her foot a squeeze where it stuck up at the end of the bed , " how 's school going , Goosie ? " " All right . " " I hear you 're learning French . Parlez-vous ? " " French is one of my subjects , yes . " " And , let 's see . . . what else ? You and me have n't had a good conversation in a long time now , have we ? " She did not answer . " Oh , and how 's Roy doing ? " Instantly she said , " Fine . " Her father took his hand off her foot at last . " Well , " he said , " we heard , you know , about the wedding . " " Where 's Daddy Will ? " she asked . " I 'm talking to you right now , Lucy . What do you want him for while I 'm talking to you ? " " I did n't say I wanted him . I only asked where he was . " " Out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to have dinner ? " " He went out ! " He rose from the bed . " I do n't ask where he goes , or when he eats . How do I know where he is ? He 's out ! " And he left the room . In a matter of seconds her mother appeared . " What happened now ? " " I asked where Daddy Will is , that 's all , " Lucy answered . " What 's wrong with that ? " " But is Daddy Will your father or is your father your father ? " " But you told him ! " she burst out . " Lucy , your voice , " said her mother , shutting the door . " But you did . You told him ! And I did n't say you should ! " " Lucy , you came home , dear ; you said  --  "  | " I do n't want him to know ! It 's not his business ! " " Now stop , Lucy  --  unless you want others to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows ! I 'm not ashamed ! And do n't start crying , Mother ! " " Then let him talk to you , please . He wants to . " " Oh , does he ? " " Lucy , you have to listen to him . You have to give him a chance . " She turned and hid her face in the pillow . " I did n't want him to know , Mother . " Her mother sat on the bed , and put her hand to the girl 's hair . " And , " said Lucy , moving back , " what was he going to say , anyway ? Why did n't he just say it out , if he had anything to say ? " . " Because , " her mother pleaded , " you did n't give him the chance . " " Well , I 'm giving you a chance , Mother . " There was a silence . " Tell me ! " " Lucy . . . dear . . . what would you think . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean  --  of going for a visit  --  " " Oh , no . " " Please let me finish . Of going to visit your father 's cousin Vera . In Florida . " " And is that his idea of what to do with me ? " " Lucy , till this is over . For the little while it will take . " " Nine months is no little while , Mother  --  " " But it would be warm there , it would be pleasant  --  " " Oh , " she said , beginning to cry into the pillow , " very pleasant . Why does n't he ship me off to a home for wayward girls , would n't that be even easier ? " " Do n't say that . He does n't want to send you anywhere , you know that . " " He wishes I 'd never been born , Mother . He thinks I 'm why everything is so wrong with him . " " That 's not so . "  | " Then , " she said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel guilty about . If he even felt guilty to begin with . " " But he does , terribly . " " Well , he should ! " she said . " He is ! " Some twenty minutes after her mother had run from the room , Daddy Will knocked . He was wearing his lumber jacket and held his cap in his hands . The brim was dark where the snow had dampened it . " Hey . I hear somebody 's been asking for me . " " Hullo . " " You sound like death warmed over , my friend . You ought to be outside and feel that wind . Then you 'd really appreciate being sick in bed . " She did not answer . " Stomach settle down ? " he asked . " Yes . " He pulled a chair over to the side of the bed . " How 's about another mustard plaster ? Berta called me at the Erwins ' and on the way home I stopped and bought a whole fresh packet . So just say when . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What is it , Lucy ? Maybe you want Dr. Eglund . That 's what I told Myra . . . " He pulled the chair right up close . " Lucy , I never saw anything like the change in him this time , " he said softly .

Fine with all of us  --  whatever you think is going to make you and Roy happy . " " I want my mother . " " Do n't you feel good again ? Maybe the doctor  --  " " I want my mother ! My mother  --  and not him ! " She was still looking at the wall when her door was opened . " Myra , " her father said , " sit over there . Sit , I said . " " Yes . " " All right , Lucy . Turn over .

If she wants to act like a two-year-old at a time like this , let her . " She whispered , " Look who 's talking about two-year-olds . " " Listen , young lady . Your backtalk does n't faze me one way or the other . There have always been smart-aleck teen-agers and there always will be , especially this generation . You just listen to me , that 's all , and if you 're too ashamed to look me right in the eye  --  " " Ashamed ! " she cried , but she did not move . " Are you or are you not going to visit Cousin Vera ? " " I do n't even know Cousin Vera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I ca n't go off alone to someone I do n't even know  --  and what ? Make up filthy lies for the neighbors  --  ? " " But they would n't be lies , " said her mother . " What would they be , Mother ? The truth ? " " They would be stories , " her father said . " That you have a husband overseas , say , in the Army . " " Oh , you know all about stories , I 'm sure . But I tell the truth ! " " Then , " he said , " just what do you intend to do about getting in trouble with somebody who you say you ca n't even stand ? " She turned violently from the wall , as though she intended to hurl herself at him . " Do n't you take such a tone with me . Do n't you dare ! " " I am not taking any tone ! " " Because I am not ashamed  --  not in front of you I 'm not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Because I can still give you a licking , smart as you think you are . " " Oh , " she said bitterly , " can you ? " " Yes ! "  | " Go ahead , then . " " Oh , wonderful , " he said , and walked to the window where he stood as though looking outside . " Just wonderful . " " Lucy , " said her mother , " if you do n't want to go to Cousin Vera 's , then what do you want to do ? Just tell us . " " You 're the parents . You were always dying to be the parents  --  " " Now look , " said her father , turning to face her once again . " First , Myra , you sit down . And stay down . And you , " he said , waving a finger at his daughter , " you give me your attention , do you hear ? Now there is a crisis here , do you understand that ? There is a crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal with it , and it 's going to be dealt with . " " Fine , " said Lucy . " Deal . " " Then be still , " her mother pleaded , " and let him talk , Lucy . " But when she made a move to sit on the bed , her husband looked at her and she retreated . " Now either I 'm going to do it , " he said to his wife , speaking between his teeth , " or I 'm not . Now which is it ? " She lowered her eyes . " Unless of course you want to call your Daddy in , " he said . " I 'm sorry . " " Now , " said her father , " if you wanted to marry that Roy Bassart  --  such as we understood you did , Lucy , till just today , and backed you up on all the way  --  that would be one thing . But this is something else entirely . Who he is I see pretty clear now , and the less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture , so there is just no need for raising voices . He was older , back from service , and just thought to himself he could come back here and take advantage of a young seventeen-year-old high school girl . And that 's what he did . But he is his father 's business , Lucy , and we will have to leave it to his high and mighty father , the big schoolteacher , to teach something into that boy 's hide . Oh , his father thinks hep177is very superior and all in his ways , but I guess he is going to have another guess coming now . But my concern is with you , Lucy , and what is uppermost to you . Do you understand that ? My concern is your going to college , which has always been your dream , right ? Now , the question is this , do you still want your dream , or do n't you ?

Now , anything , " he went on . " Even something that is n't usual and ordinary , and that might to some folks seem very  --  out of the question . " He came closer to the bed so that he could speak without being heard outside the room . " Now do you know what anything means , before I go to the next step ? " " Giving up whiskey ?

" Drink is neither here nor there . Drink is not the issue . " " Oh no ? " " No ! A baby is ! " And that made her look away . " An illegitimate baby is , " he said again . " And if you do n't want that illegitimate baby "  --  his voice had fallen almost to aWhen She Was Good : 178whisper now  --  " then maybe we will have to arrange that you do n't have it .

" " We 're the other people who live here . " " Be still ! " he said . " Everybody knows that without your backtalk ! " " Then just what are you proposing to me ? Say it ! " Her mother rushed to the bed at last . " Lucy , " she said , taking hold of her hand , " Lucy , it 's only to help you  --  " And then her father took hold of the other hand , and it was as though some current were about to pass through the three of them .

He would have all his medical degrees right up on the wall , in frames . When she went off with him into the little white operating room , her mother and father would smile at her from the sofa . And they would wait right there until it was time to bundle her up and take her home . When her father had finished , she said , " It must cost a fortune .

The object is n't money , The object is you . " But where , " she asked softly , " will you get it all ? " " Let me do the worrying about that , " her father said . " Okay ? " " Will you work ? " " Wow , " he said to Myra . " She sure do n't pull her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had risen into his cheeks remained , even as he tried to maintain a soft and joking tone . " Come on , Goosie , what do you say ? Give me a break , huh ? Where do you think I 've been all day today , anyway ? Taking a stroll on the boulevard ? Playing a tennis game ? What do you think I 've been doing all my life since I was eighteen years old , and part-time before that ? Work , Lucy , just plain old work , day in and day out . " " Not at one job , " she said . " Well . . . I move around . . . that 's true ... " She was going to cry : they were talking ! " Look , " he said , " why do n't you think of it this way . You have a father who is a jack of all trades . You should be proud . Come on , Goosie-Pie , how about a smile like I used to get back in prehistoric times ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Huh , little Goose ? " She felt her mother squeeze her hand . " Look , " he said , " why do you think people always hirep180Duane Nelson , no matter what ? Because he sits around twiddlinghis thumbs , or because he knows every kind of machine there is , inside and out ? Now which ? That 's not a hard question , is it , for a smart college girl ? " . , . Afterward she would read in bed . She would have her assignments mailed up to her while she recuperated in her bed , Yes , a college girl . And without Roy . He was n't so bad ; he was n't for her , that was all . He would just disappear , and she could begin to make friends at school , friends to bring home with her when she came to visit on the weekend . For things would have changed . Could that be ? At long last those terrible days of hatred and solitude , over ? To think , she could begin again to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things she was studying , to show them the books she used in her courses , to show them her papers . Stuck into her English book , right there on the floor , was the essay she had written on " Ozymandias . " B-plus and across the front the professor had written , " Excellent paragraph development ; good understanding of meaning ; good use of quotations ; but please do n't stuff your sentences so . " And maybe she had overdone the main topic sentence somewhat , but her intention had been to state at the outset all those ideas that she would later take up in the body of the essay . " Even a great king , " her paper began , " such as Ozymandias apparently had been , could not predict or control what the future , or Fate , held in store for him and his kingdom ; that , I think , is the messagethat Percy Bysshe Shelley , the poet , means for us to come away with from his romantic poem Ozymandias , ' which not only reveals the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ king 's  --  but deals also with the concept of the immensity of boundless and bare ' life and the inevitability of the colossal wreck ' of everything , as compared to the sneer of cold command , ' which is all many mere mortals have at their command , unfortunately . " " But is he clean ? " she asked . " A hundred percent , " her father said . " Spotless , Lucy . Like a hospital . "  | " And how old ? " she asked . " How old is he ? " " Oh , " her father said , " middle-aged , I 'd say . " A moment passed . Then , " That 's the catch , is n't it ? " " What kind of catch ? " " He 's too old . " " Now what do you mean too old ' ? If anything , he 's real experienced . " " But is this all he does ? " " Lucy , he 's a regular doctor . . . who does this as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he charges , you said . " " Well , sure he charges . " " Then it 's not a special favor . He does it for money . " " Well , everybody has got bills to meet . Everybody has got to be paid for what they do . " But she saw herself dead . The doctor would be no good , and she would die . " How do you know about him ? " " Because  --  " and here he stood , and hitched up his trousers . " Through a friend , " he finally said . " Who ? " " Lucy , I 'm afraid maybe that 's got to be a secret . " " But where did you hear about him ? " Where would he hearabout such a doctor ? " At Earl 's famous Dugout of Buddies ? " " Lucy , that 's not necessary , " said her mother . Her father walked to the window again . He cleared a pane with the palm of his hand . " Well , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snowing , if anybody cares . " " All I meant  --  " Lucy began . " Is what ? " He had turned back to her. "  --  is . . . do you know anybody who he 's ever done it to , that 's all . " " Yes , I happen to , for your information . " " And they 're alive ? " " For your information , yes ! " " Well , it 's my life . I have a right to know . " " Why do n't you just trust me ! I 'm not going to kill you ! "  | " Oh , Duane , " her mother said , " she does . " " Do n't speak for me , Mother ! " " Hear that ? " he cried to his wife . " Well , he might just be some quack drinking friend who says he 's a doctor or something . Well , how do I know , Mother ? Maybe it 's even Earl himself in his red suspenders ! " " Yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shouted . " Earl DuVal ! sure ! What 's the matter with you ? You think I do n't mean it when I say I want you to finish college ? " " Dear , he does . You 're his daughter . " " That does n't mean he knows whether a doctor is good or not , Mother . Suppose I die ! " " But I told you , " he cried , shaking a fist at her , " you wo n't ! " " But how do you know ? " " Because she did n't , did she ! " " Who ? " No one had to speak for her to understand . " Oh , no . " She dropped slowly back against the headboard . Her mother , at the side of the bed , covered her face with her hands . " When ? " said Lucy . " But she 's alive , is n't she ? " He was pulling at his shirt with his hands . " Answer the point I 'm making ! I am speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt in any way at all ! " " Mother , " she said , turning to her , " when ? " But her mother only shook her head . Lucy got up out of the bed . " Mother , when did he make you do that ? " " He did n't make me . " " Oh , Mother , " she said , standing before her . " You 're my mother . " " Lucy , it was the Depression times . You were a little girl . It was so long ago . Oh , Lucy , it 's all forgotten . Daddy Will , Grandma , they do n't know , " she whispered , "  --  do n't have to  --  " " But the Depression was over when I was three , when I was four . " " What ? " her father cried . " Are you kidding ? " To his wife he said , " Is she kidding ? "  | " Lucy , " her mother said , " we did it for you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onto her bed , " for me , everything was for me . " " Lucy , we could n't have another baby , " said her mother . " Not when we were so behind , trying so to fight back  --  " " But if only he did his job ! If he only stopped being a coward ! " " Look , " he said , coming angrily at her , " you do n't even know when the Depression was , or what it was , either  --  so watch what you say ! " " I do too know ! " " The whole country was behind the eightball . Not just me ! If you want to call names , you , call the whole United States of America names ! " " Sure , the whole world .

You  --  you just want me behind bars  --  that 's your big wish in life , and always has been ! " " It 's not . " " It is ! " " But that 's over , " cried Myra . " Oh , sure it 's over , " said Whitey . " Sure , people just forget how a daughter threw her own father in jail . Sure , people do n't talk about that behind your back .

The town drunk to her . " He pulled open the door and went loudly down the stairs . They could hear him bellowing in the parlor . " Go ahead , Mr. Carroll . You 're the only one can solve things around here . Go ahead , it 's Daddy Will everyone wants around here anyway . I 'm just extra anyway . I 'm just along for the ride , we all know that .

" " Duane , where are you going ? "  | " I do n't know . Maybe I 'll go down and see old Tom Whipper . " " Who 's he ? " " The town drunk , Willard ! That 's who the town drunk is , damn it  --  Tom Whipper ! " The door slammed , and then the house was silent except for the whispering that began downstairs . Lucy lay without moving on the bed . Her mother was crying . " Mother , why , why did you let him make you do that ? " " I did what I had to , " said her mother mournfully . " You did n't ! You let him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doormat ! His slave ! " " Lucy , I did what was necessary , " she said , sobbing . " That 's not always right , though . You have to do what 's right ! " " It was . " She spoke as in a trance . " It was , it was  --  " " It was n't ! Not for you ! He degrades you , Mother , and you let him ! Always ! All our lives ! " " Oh , Lucy , whatever we say , our suggestions , you refuse . " " I refuse  --  I refuse to live your life again , Mother , that 's what I refuse ! " Roy 's best man was Joe Whetstone , home from the Universityof Alabama , where he had kicked nine field goals and twenty-three consecutive extra points for the freshman football team . The maid of honor was Eleanor Sowerby . Unbeknownst to Joe , Ellie had fallen in love at Northwestern . She simply had to tell Lucy , though she made her promise to speak of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shortly be having to write Joe a letter , and she would just as soon not have to think about that during her vacation ; it would be difficult enough at the time . Either Ellie had forgiven Lucy for calling her a dope at Thanksgiving , or else she was willing to forget it during the wedding . All through the ceremony tears coursed down her lovely face , and her own lips moved when Lucy said , " I do . "  |p186After  the ceremony Daddy Will told Lucy that she was the most beautiful bride he had seen since her mother . " A real bride , " he kept saying , " is n't that so , Berta ? " " Congratulations , " her grandmother said . " You were a real bride . " That was as far as she would go ; she knew now that it was not the grippe that had caused Lucy to be sick in the kitchen sink . Julian Sowerby kissed her again . " Well , " he said , " I suppose now I get to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Roy . Julian said , " Lucky you , boy , she 's a cutie-pie , all right , " in no way indicating that he had once lectured Roy for four solid hours in the taproom of the Hotel Kean on the evils of becoming her husband . Nor did Irene Sowerby indicate that secretly she believed Lucy had unusual emotions . " Good luck to you , " she said to the bride , and touched her lips to Lucy 's cheek . She took Roy 's hand and held it for a very long time before she was ready to speak . And then she was unable to . Then her own parents . " Daughter , " was all she heard in her ear ; so stiff was she in his embrace that perhaps it was all he said . " Oh , Lucy , " her mother said , her wet lashes against Lucy 's face , " be happy . You can be if only you 'll try . You were the happiest little girl ... " Then both Roy 's parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to be deferring to the other , the two Bassarts lunged at the bride simultaneously . The mixupof arms and faces that ensued at long last gave everyone present something to laugh about . Lloyd Bassart was the adult who had finally gotten behind the young couple and supported them in their desire to be married at Christmas  --  sooner than Christmas if it could be managed . This sharp change of attitude had occurred one night early in December when Roy broke down over the phone and in tears told his parents  --  who had been pouring it on , once again  --  to stop . " I ca n't take any more ! " he had cried . " Stop ! Stop ! Lucy 's pregnant ! " Well . Well . It had required only the two " wells . " If what Roy had just confessed was the actual situation as it existed ,  |p187then  his father did not see that Roy had any choice but to take the responsibility for what he had done . Between a man doing the right thing and a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as far as Mr. Bassart could see . Weeping , Roy said it was more or less what he had been thinking to himself all along . " I should certainly hope so , " said his father , and so that , finally , was that . She moved into his room at Mrs. Blodgett 's . Mrs. Blodgett , who had called her a hussy . Mrs. Blodgett , who had called Roy crooked . Mrs. Blodgett , with her thousand little rules and regulations . But Lucy said nothing . In the weeks and months following the wedding she found herself trying with all her might to do what she was told . You could not question someone 's every word and deed and expect to be happy with them , or expect them to be happy either . They were married . She must trust him ; what kind of life would it be otherwise ? Mrs. Blodgett and Roy had worked out the arrangement beforehand : only another five dollars a month for the room . Surely Lucy had to admit that was a bargain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in kitchen privileges for the hour between seven and eight in the evening . Of course , they would have to leave the kitchen exactly as they had found it . It was not , after all , the kitchen of a hotel , it was the kitchen of a dwelling place ; but apparently Roy had assuredMrs . Blodgett that Lucy was neat as a pin , and knew her way around a kitchen , having worked for three years after school and summers in the Dairy Bar up in Liberty Center . " But that , Mr. Bassart , is my very point , it is not some dairy bar , it is not some  --  " He assured her then that he wouldp192work in the kitchen right along with Lucy . How would that be ? In fact , if Mrs. Blodgett had any dishes left over from her own dinner , they could easily wash hers while washing up their own . In the Army he had once had to wash pots and pans for seventeen hours straight on K.P. ; as a result , one dish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could be sure . Mrs. Blodgett said she would extend them the privilege , on a trial basis , and only for so long as they did n't abuse it . During the next few months Roy several times went out after dinner and knocked on the parlor door to ask the landladyif she would like to join them in the kitchen for dessert . Privately he said to Lucy that the extra chocolate pudding or fruit cup cost no more than a few pennies , and with someone of Mrs. Blodgett 's changeable disposition , it was worth building up points on your side . Their getting married had more or less restored Mrs. Blodgett 's faith in him , but still and all , where three people were living together under one roof , there was no sense looking for trouble , especially if you could just as easily avoid it by using your head in advance . She said nothing . They must not squabble over issues that were of no real consequence . She must not criticize him for what  --  she told herself  --  was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people did things one way , and Roy did them another . Were n't they married ? Had n't he acted as she had wanted ? TRUST HIM . To her surprise , hardly a Sunday passed when they did not travel up to Liberty Center to visit his family . Roy said that under ordinary circumstances it would n't be necessary , but what with all the strain of the past months and the hard feelingsthat had developed , it seemed to him a good idea to try to smooth things over before the baby was born and life really began to get hectic . The fact was that she was a stranger to his family , as he was a stranger to hers . Now that they were married , what sense did that make ? They would all be seeing a lot of one another in the years to come , and it seemed to him ridiculous to start off on the wrong foot . It was an easy two/hour ride up , and aside from the gas , what would it cost them ? So she went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the way out of town , over to say hello to her own family . Silently she sat in the parlor she had hoped never to set foot in again , while Roy engaged her family in fifteen minutes of small talk , most of it for the benefit of her father and Daddy Will . They talked a lot about prefab houses . Her father was supposed to be thinking about building a prefab house , and Daddy Will was supposed to be thinking that it was something her father was capable of doing . Roy said he had buddies down at Britannia who could probably help them draw up plans , when they got to that stage . Contractors were throwing up whole communities of prefabs overnight , Roy said . Oh , it 's a real building revolution , her father said . It sure is , Mr. Nelson . Yep , looks like the coming thing , said Daddy Will . It sure does , Mr. Carroll , they 're throwing up whole communities overnight . One Sunday evening , while driving back down to Fort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though your old man is really on the wagon this time . " " I hate him , Roy . And I will always hate him . I told you long ago , and I meant it : I do n't want to talk about him , ever ! " " Okay , " said Roy lightly , " okay , " and so no quarrel resulted . He seemed willing to forget that he had even brought up the subject  --  as willing as he was to forget that hatred of which Lucy had sought to remind him . So they set off , Sunday after Sunday , like any young married couple visiting the in-laws . But why ? Why ? Because that 's what they were : she was his wife . And her mother his mother-in-law . And her father , with the thick new mustache and the bright new plans , was Roy 's father-in-law . " But I 'd really rather not , Roy , not today . " " Come on , we 're up here , are n't we ? I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even saying hello ? What 's the big deal ? Come on , honey , do n't act like a kid , get in the car  --  careful , watch the old belly . "  |p194And  she did not argue . Could it be she had actually argued her last ? She had fought and fought to get him to do his duty , but in the end he had done it . So what more was there to fight about ? She simply could not find the strength to raise her voice . And she must respect him anyway . She must not pick at what he said , or challenge his opinions , or take issue with him , especially on matters where his knowledge was superior to her own . Or was supposed to be . She was his wife ; she must be sympathetic to his point of view , even if she did n't always agree with it , as she surely did n't when he began to tell her how much more he knew than the teachers at Britannia . Unfortunately , Britannia had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be in all those fancy brochures . For one thing , it had n't been established in 1910 , at least not as a photography school . They had only decided to branch out into photography after the war , so as to catch a bigger hunk of the G.I. Bill trade . For the first thirty-five years of its existenceit had been a drafting school called the Britannia TechnicalInstitute , and two thirds of the students still were guys interested in getting into the building business  --  which was how Roy came to know so much about the prefab boom . The drafting students , as a matter of fact , were n't too bad ; it was the photography students who were a scandal . Though you had to fill out a long entrance application , and with it send samples of your work , it turned out that there were n't any real entrance requirements at all . The procedure for photography applicants was just a ruse to make you think that the new department had some sort of standards . And the quality of the faculty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality of the students  --  particularly one H. Harold LaVoy , who somewhere along the line had got the idea that he was some sort of expert on photographic technique . Some expert . There was more to be learned about composition by flipping through an issue of Look than spending a lifetime listening to a pompous idiot like LaVoy ( who some of the guys said might be a fairy , besides . A real queer . For Lucy 's edification , he imitatedp195LaVoy walking down the halls . A bit la-dee-da , did n't she agree ? But even a homo could teach you something if he knew something . But a dumb homo  --  well , that was just about the end ) . LaVoy 's class was at eight in the morning , Roy 's first of the day . He got up and went off to it faithfully every single morning of the first month of the second semester , every morningwent off to listen to that nasal-voiced know-it-all going on and on about absolutely nothing that a ten-year-old kid could n't figure out if he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gentlemen , by placing object A between the sun and object B. " Brother . One stormy morning they got as far as the front porch , when Roy turned around , came back into the room , and Army boots , field jacket and all , threw himself back on the bed , moaning , " Oh , I do n't mind a homo , really , but a dumb homo ! " He said he could find better uses to make of that hour right here in their room , he was sure . And since his next class was n't until eleven , by staying home he would be saving not only the hour LaVoy shot for him , but the two hours following , which he usually spent down in the lounge , watching one of the endless blackjack games that was always in session . It was so smoky and noisy down there that that 's about all you could do . Having a conversation about photographywas practically impossible  --  not that any of his fellow students seemed to be disposed in that direction anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was back in the day room up in the Aleutians . And what did Lucy do ? She went down to the corner and caught the crosstown bus to school for her eight o'clock . Roy said he would drive her over if she wanted ; now that she was getting bigger he did n't like the idea of her taking public transportation , or walking around on slippery streets . But she declined that first morning , and on those snowy mornings thereafter . It was all right , she said , there was nothing to worry about , she preferred not to inconvenience him by taking him away from his studying if that 's what studying was to him , sitting up in bed with a scissors and the magazines hisp196mother saved for him every week , eating handfuls of those Hydrox cookies ! But maybe he knew what he was doing . Maybe the school was a fraud . Maybe his colleagues were dopes . Maybe LaVoy was pompous and an idiot , and a homosexualtoo . Maybe everything he said was true and everything he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , walking through the snow to the bus , and then in class , and in the library , and in the coffee shop , where she went by herself for her lunch , after her one-thirty . Most of the girls ate in the cafeteria at noon , as she had when she lived in the dorm , and she preferred now to avoid them whenever she could manage it . Eventually one of them would take a sidelong glance at her belly , and why did she have to put up with that ? There was no reason for any of those little freshman twerps to look down their noses at her . To them she might only be the kid who 'd had to get married over Christmas , somebody to whisper about and make fun of , but to herself she was Mrs. Roy Bassart , and she did n't intend to go around feeling ashamed of herself all day long . She had nothing whatsoever to be ashamed of or to regret . So she ate her lunch , alone , at two-thirty , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first Sunday of June , while they were driving up to Liberty Center , Roy decided he was n't going to take his finals the following week . Frankly , he could go in and pass things like camera repair and negative retouching without too much sweat , to use an Army expression . So it was n't a matter of chickening out , or of being too lazy to do the studying . There really was n't very much studying that he could see to do . What made it senseless to go in and take the final exams  --  which , by the way , no one had flunked in the history of the photography department , except in LaVoy 's class , where it was n't a matter of whether you knew the material anyway but whether you agreed with Hot Shot LaVoy and his big ideas  --  but what made it senseless was that he had decided not to return to Britannia in the fall . At least that , at any rate , was what he wanted to talk over with her. **25;8077;TOOLONG which lie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , elevated " S " the ragged length and width of a small garter snake , souvenir of old-time branding days , winds its way through the sparse gray hairs of his black chest .

For although like Nelson he has been driven half crazy by slavery , Will 's madness is not governed by silence and some final secret control , but has the frenzied , mindless quality of a wild boar hog cornered hopelesslyin a thicket , snarling and snapping its brutish and unavailingwrath . Age twenty-five or a little more , a chronic runaway , he once got nearly to Maryland , sustained in his flight not so much by intelligence as by the same cunning and endurance of those little animals native to the swamps and woods in which he roamed for six weeks , before being overhauledand delivered to his present master , a nigger-breaker named Nathaniel Francis who has beaten him into some kind of stunned and temporary submission . He crouches behind me now , muttering to whom it is impossible to tell  --  to himself , to no one , to anyone at all . Ole white cunt , he whispers , and in a sort of demented litany repeats it over and over . Will 's presence disturbs me , for I want no part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I am afraid that he will discover what 's afoot . Rather than finding any value in his fractiousness , his rage and rebellion , I am filled with distrust , instinctively put off by the foaming and frenzied nature of his madness . Besides , there is one other thing , evident enough now in that obsessive incantation : I know from hearsay that he broods constantly upon rape , the despoliation of white women masters his dreams night and day . And already  --  and Hark and Nelson and the others have sworn to obey  --  I have forbidden this kind of violation . It is God 's will , and I knowIp103it , that I omit such a vengeance : Do not unto their women what they have done to thine .. . I banish Will from my mind and as my eyes rove around the gallery I see the other two in whom I have placed my trust . Owned like Will by Nathaniel Francis , Sam is a mulatto , a wiry muscular young field hand with freckles and ginger-colored hair . He is intractable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his yellow skin is knobbed and striped by the lash . I value him for his intelligence but also for his color : he is light of hue and his presence thus commandsconsiderable respect among many of the Negroes , especially the simple-minded , and I feel that when my scheme achieves momentum Sam 's appearance will be useful in gainingnew recruits . He is skillful in quiet , furtive intrigue and has already won for the cause Henry , who sits beside him now , eyes shut , rocking slightly , with a look of beatitude and calm . So far as I can tell , he is sound asleep . Short , square in shape , very black , he alone among my group is of a religious nature . He is owned by Richard Porter , a devout and kindly master who has never raised a hand against him . At forty , Henry lives among Biblical fancies , in a shadowland of near-silence , almost completely deaf from boyhood by a blow on the head from a drunken overseer whose name or face he can no longer remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his calm fury .. . The sound of organ music fills the air . The sermon is ended . Down below , the white people have risen , joining together in song . " Can we , whose souls are lighted With wisdom from on high , Can we to men benightedThe lamp of life deny ? " The black people do not sing but stand respectfully in the hot gallery , mouths agape or with sloppy uncomprehending smiles , shuffling their feet . Suddenly they seem to me asp104meaningless and as stupid as a barn full of mules , and I hate them one and all . My eyes search the white crowd , finally discover Margaret Whitehead , her dimpled chin tilted up as , with one arm entwined in her mother 's , she carols heavenward , a radiance like daybreak on her serene young face . Then slowly and softly , like a gentle outrush of breath , my hatred of the Negroes diminshes , dies , replaced by a kind of wild , desperate love for them , and my eyes are wet with tears . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Till each remotest nationHas learnt Messiah 's name ... " And later that afternoon  --  after the hurried secret parley by the creek  --  driving the carriage back home through the parched and windless fields , I hear behind me two voices now , Margaret Whitehead 's and her mother 's , fondly : I do think Boysie 's sermon was most inspiring , do n't you , little Miss Peg ? There is a short space of silence , then her bright laughter : Oh , Mother , it 's the same old folderol , every year ! Just folderol for the darkies ! Margaret ! What an expression to use ! Folderol indeed ! I 'm simply appalled ! If your sainted father were here , to hear you talk like that about your own brother . Shame ! Then suddenly , to my surprise , I realize that Margaret is close to tears . Oh , Mother , I 'm sorry , I just do n't know . And she is quietly sobbing now . I just do n't know . I just do n't know ... . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rustle . There , there , dear . I understand . It must be a bad time of the month . We 'll be home soon and you can just go lie down and I 'll make you a nice cup of tea . . . High over the flat land thunderheads loom , their under/sides churning , promising a storm . I feel the sweat rolling down my back . After a bit I let my eyes close , and I smell the rich odor of horse droppings as I make a silent prayer : Forsake me not , 0 Lord : 0 my God , be not far from me . Make haste to help me , 0 Lord my salvation , for the hour of my battle comes near .. . " Nat Turner ! Stand up ! " I rose to my feet in the courtroom . It was hot and very still , and for a long time as I stood clumsily in my chains leaning against the table there was no interruption to the silence save for the panting and roaring of the stove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did so , regarding him for the first time straight on , I saw that his face was as white as tallow ; drawn and almost fleshless , it was the face of a cadaver , and it trembled and nodded as if with palsy . He looked down at me , the eyes sunk deep within their sockets , so that the effect was that of a gaze from some immeasurable distance , profoundas all eternity . Then all of a sudden I realized that he too was close to death , very close , almost as close as I myself , and I felt a curious pang of pity and regret . Cobb spoke again . " Have you anything to say why sentenceof death should not be pronounced against you ? " His voice was tremulous , feeble , dead . " I have not , " I replied . " I have made a full confession to Mr. Gray and I have nothing more to say . " . " Attend then to the sentence of the court . You have been arraigned and tried before this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our criminal code . You have been convicted of plotting in cold blood the indiscriminate destruction of men , of helpless women , and of infant children . . . The evidence before us leaves not a shadow of doubt but that your hands were imbrued in the blood of the innocent , and your own confession tells us that they were stained with the blood of a master  --  in your own language , too indulgent . Could I stop here your crime would be sufficiently aggravated . But the original contriver of a plan , deep and deadly , one that never could be effected , you managed so far to put it into execution as to deprive us of many of our most valuable citizens , and this was done when they were asleep under circumstancesshocking to humanity . . . And while upon this part of the subject , I can not but call your attention to the poor misguided wretches who have gone before you . " He paused for an instant , breathing heavily . " They are not few in number  --  theywere your bosom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and calls upon you as the author of their misfortune . Yes . You forced them unprepared from time to eternity ... Borne down by this load of guilt , your only justification is that you were led away by fanaticism . " He paused again , gazing at me from the awful and immeasurabledistances where not alone his eyes but his dying flesh and spirit seemed to dwell , remote as the stars . " If this be true , " he concluded slowly , " from my soul I pity you , and while you have my sympathies I am nevertheless called upon to pass sentence of the court ... The time between this and your execution will necessarily be very short , and your only hope must be in another world . The judgment of the court is that you be taken hence to the jail from whence you came , thence to the place of execution , and on Friday next , Novembereleventh , at sunrise , be hung by the neck until you are dead ! dead ! dead !  --  and may the Lord have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other from vast distances , yet close , awesomely close , as if sharing for the briefest instant some rare secret  --  unknown to other men  --  of all time , all mortality and sin and grief . In the stillness the stove howled and raged like a tumultuous storm pitched in the firmament between hell and heaven . A door flew open with a clatter . Then we ceased looking at each other , and outside a human roar went up like thunder.  |p107That  evening as Hark talked to me through the cracks of the jail wall , his voice came pained and laborious and with a sort of faint gurgle or croak , like a frog 's . Only Hark could have lived so long . He had been shot through the chest on that day in August when they broke us up . Time after time they had carried him to court on a litter and they were going to have to hang him roped to a chair . The two of us would be the last to go . Dusk was coming on : as the cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cell as from a vessel , turning the corners dark , and the cedar plank I was lying on grew as chill as a slab of stone . A few leaves clung to the branches outside and through the gray twilight a cold wind whispered sharply , and often a leaf would flicker to earth or scuttle through the cell with a dry rattling sound . Every now and then I listened to Hark , but mainly I waited on Gray . After the trial he had said that he would come again this evening , and he promised to bring me a Bible . The idea of a Bible kept me in a greedy suspense , as if after a day 's long thirst in some parched and burning field someone was about to fetch me brimming pails of cool clear water . " Oh yes , Nat , " I heard Hark say beyond the wall , " yes , dey was lots and lots of niggers kilt afterwards , w'ile you was hid out . And war n't our niggers neither . Dey tells me roun ' about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nat , de white folks come down like a swarm of golly-wasps and plain long stomped de niggers ev'ywheres . You didn ' know about dat , Nat ? Oh yes , dey was plain long stomped . White folks dey come fum all over ev'ywheres . Dey come a-gallopin ' down from Sussex an ' Isle of Wight and all dem other counties an ' run de niggers clean into de groun ' . Didn ' make no nem'mine dat dey didn ' fight fo ' Nat Turner . If'n he had a black ass , dey fill hit full of lead . " Hark was silent for a while and I could hear his thick , tortured breathing . " After you was hid out I heerd tell of some ole free nigger dat was standin ' in a field up some/wheres aroun ' Drewrysville . Dese white folks rode up an ' stop dere . Is dis yere Southampton ? ' dey holler . Nigger he say , Yassuh , boss , you done jes ' passed de county line over yondah . ' ' Pon my soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Again he was silent , then he said : " I heerd tell of a nigger name of Statesman livin ' down aroun ' Smith 's Mill what ai n't even heerd of de ruction , bein ' slow in de head , you know ? Anyways , his massah he powerful exercise ' an ' mad an ' he take ole Statesman out an ' tie him to a tree an ' shoot him so full of holes you could see de sun shine th'ough . Oh me , Nat . Some sad stories I done heerd all dese months in jail ... " I watched the wintry gray light stealing softly away from the cell , thinking : 0 Lord , hear ; 0 Lord , forgive ; 0 Lord , hearken and do ; defer not , for thine own sake , 0 my God , forgive me the blood of the innocent and slain . . . But it was not a prayer at all , there was no echo , no understanding that it had reached God 's almighty hearing , only the sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of smoke . A shudder passed through my bones and I clasped my arms around my legs , trying to still their shaking . Then as if to blot out this new knowledge , I broke in upon Hark , saying : " Tell me , Hark , tell me . Nelson . Tell me about Nelson . How did he die ? Did he die brave ? " " Why sho he die brave , " Hark said . " Hung ole Nelson back in September . Him and Sam together , standing ' up straight as you could pray for , both dem . Dey tells me ole Sam wouldn ' die right off , flew off'n dat hangin ' tree an ' jes ' jiggle dere like a turkey gobbler a-jumpin ' and a-twitchin ' . " Feebly , softly , Hark began to laugh . " Reckon dat li'l ole yellownigger was too light fo ' de rope . Dem white folks had to yank on old Sam 's feet afore he 'd give up de ghost . But he died brave , though , him an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groanin ' when dem two niggers died . " He paused and sighed , then said : " Onliest thing ole Sam was sad about was dat we didn ' cotch dat mean sonabitch Nat Francis datp109owned him . Cotched his overseer and two chillun but not Nat Francis . Dat 's what give Sam a misery . I seed Nat Francis in de cou'troom de day dey tried ole Sam . Jesus jumpin ' Judas ! Talk ' bout a mad white man ! Oo-ee , Nat , he let out a howl and jump straight over de railin ' an ' like to strangle dat Sam befo ' dey could haul him off . I heerd tell Nat Francis like to went clean out'n his head after we finished de ruction . Got him a gang of folks an ' rode from Cross Keys to Jerusalem , shootin ' down ev'y nigger in sight . Dey was a free nigger woman name Laurie , wife to old John Bright live up Cloud School way , you know ? Well , dey took dat woman an ' leant her up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up her ole pussy like dey was layin ' out a barbecue . Oh me , Nat , de tales I heerd tell dese months and days ! Dey was two white mens I heerd about , come up from Carolina , has actual got dem a real bunch of black nigger heads all nailed to a pole and was out to git dem some mo ' till de troops grabbed holt ' em an ' run ' em back to Carolina  --  " " Hush , " I broke in . " Hush , Hark ! That 's enough . I ca n't bear no more of that . I ca n't bear such talk no more . " I tried not to think , yet even as I tried could not help thinking , scraps of prayer afloat turbulent and spinning in my brain like twigs upon a flood : 0 spare me , that I may recover strength . Before I go hence . And be no more . I heard footsteps in the passageway , and suddenly Gray appeared at the door with the boy Kitchen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't stay but a minute , Reverend , " he said as he stepped into the cell and sat himself down across from me slowly , with a soft weary grunt . He looked exhausted and unstrung . I noticed that he was carrying nothing with him , and I felt my heart sink like a stone ; even before I could start to protest , though , he had begun to speak : " I know , I know , that durn Bible ! I know I promised to fetch you one  --  I 'm a man of my word , Reverend  --  but I run into a patch of difficulty , all unforeseen . The vote was five to one agin it . "  | " What do you mean , Mr. Gray ? " I exclaimed . " What vote ? Mr. Gray , I ai n't asked for much  --  " " I know , I know , " he put in . " By all rights any man condemned to death should have the fullest spiritual comfort , be he black or white . And this afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own personal use , I brought this fact out in the strongest terms . But like I say , Reverend , I run into a bit of difficulty . The majority of the Justices did n't cotton to this idea in any way , shape , nor four ' . In the first place , they felt very strongly about the moot point in  --  and the general tenor of  --  the community feeling as it stands , namely , that no nigger is to be allowed to read or write anyhow . In the second place , and on account of this , since no nigger about to be hung in this county has ever been allowed to have a Bible , why then , they could n't make an exception in your case . So they took a vote . Five to one against your havin ' a Bible , with only the Chief Magistrate in favor  --  Mr. JeremiahCobb , who 's about to cash in hisself , so I guess he 's got good reason to be soft on matters pertainin ' to spiritual com-fort . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm sorry about that , Mr. Gray . It 'll be right tough on me without a Bible . " Gray was silent for a while , a queer quizzical look on his face . Then he said : " Tell me , Reverend , you ever heard tell of a galaxy ? " " A what ? " I said . I was barely listening . I can not describe my misery and desolation . " A galaxy . G-a-l-a-x-y . Galaxy . " " Well , sir , " I replied finally , " I may have heard that word used , but I ca n't rightly say I know what it exactly means . " " Well , you know what the sun is , " he said . " The sun do n't move around the earth , a great big ball up there . The sun is a star . You know about that , do n't you ? " " Yes , " I said , " it seems to me I did hear about that . There was a white man in Newsoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was one of those Quaker men . " " And you believe it ? " " I used to think it was right hard to believe , " I said , " but I 've come to believe it . By the Lord 's grace all things can be believed . " " Well , you know the sun is a star , but you do n't exactly know what a galaxy is . That right ? " " No , I do n't know , " I replied . " Well now , in England there 's a great astronomer name of Professor Herschel . Know what an astronomer is ? Yes ? Well , there was a big write-up on him not long ago in the Richmondnewspaper . What Professor Herschel has found out is that this here star of our'n that we call the sun is but one of not thousands , not millions , but billions of stars all revolvin ' around in a great big kind of cartwheel that he calls a galaxy . And this sun of our'n is just a piddlin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stars on the edge of the galaxy . Fancy that , Reverend ! " He leaned forward toward me , and I could smell the sudden apple-sweet perfumeof his presence . " Fancy that ! Millions and even billions of stars all floatin ' around in the vastness of space , separated by distances the mind ca n't even conceive of . Why , Reverend , the light we see from some of these stars must of left there long before man hisself ever dwelt on earth ! A million years before Jesus Christ ! How do you square that with your Christianity ? How do you square that with God ? " I pondered this for a moment , then I said : " As I told you , Mr. Gray , by the Lord 's grace all things can be believed . I accept the sun and the stars , and the galaxies too . " " Hogwash ! " he exclaimed . " Christianity is finished and done with . Do n't you know that , Reverend ? And do n't you realize further that it was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prime mover , of this entire miserable catastrophe ? Do n't you see the plain ordinary evil of your dad-burned Bible ? "  |p112He  fell silent , and I too said nothing . Though I was no longer either as hot or cold as I had been that morning  --  indeed , for the first time that day I felt a tolerable comfort  --  my throat had gotten dry and I found it difficult to swallow . I closed my eyes for a second , opened them again : in the cold , pale , diminishing light Gray seemed to be smiling at me , though perhaps it was only the dimness of the twilight which blurred and made indistinct the configurations of his heavy round face . I felt that I had only faintly understood what Gray had said  --  grasped the barest beginnings of it ; finally I replied in a dry voice , the frog still in my throat : " What do you mean , Mr. Gray ? I fear I do n't quite follow . Evil ? " Gray leaned forward , slapping his knee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the record ! Jes ' look at it ! Look at your own words ! The words you rattled off to me for three days rennin ' ! The divine spirit ! Seek ye the kingdom of heaven ! My wisdom came from God ! All that hogwash , what I mean . And what 's that line you told me the heavenly spirit said to you when you were about to embark on this bloody course of your'n ? For he who knows  --  What ? " " For he who knoweth his Master 's will , " I said , " and doeth it not , shall be beaten with many stripes , and thus have I chastened you . " " Yeah , hogwash like that , what I mean . Divine guidance . Holy will . Messages from up above . Durndest slop ever I heard of . And what did it get you ? What , Reverend ? " I made no reply , even though now I had begun to understand what he was trying to say . I stopped looking at him and thrust my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find it necessary to go on . " Here 's what it got you , Reverend , if you 'll pardon the crudity . It got you a pissy-assed record of total futility , the likes of which are hard to equal . Threescore white people slain in random butchery , yet the white people still firmly holdin ' the reins . Seventeen niggers hung , including you andp113old Hark there , nevermore to see the light of day . A dozen or more other nigger boys shipped out of an amiable way of life to Alabama , where you can bet your bottom dollar that in five years the whole pack of ' em will be dead of work and fever . I 've seen them cotton plantations . I 've seen them rice layouts too , Reverend  --  niggers up to their necks in shit from day clean to first dark , with a big black driver to whip ' em , and mosquitoes the size of buzzards . This is what you brung on them kids , Reverend , this is what Christianity brung on them boys . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , did you ? " I was silent for a moment , considering his question , then I said : " No . " For indeed , to be most truthful , I had not figured on it then . " And what else did Christianity accomplish ? " he said . " Here 's what Christianity accomplished . Christianity accomplishedthe mob . The mob . It accomplished not only your senseless butchery , the extermination of all those involved in it , black and white , but the horror of lawless retaliation and reprisal  --  one hundred and thirty-one innocent niggers both slave and free cut down by the mob that roamed Southamptonfor a solid week , searching vengeance . I reckon you did n't figure on that neither back then , did you , Reverend ? " " No , " I said quietly , " Legislature convenes in December they 're goin ' to pass laws that make the ones extant look like rules for a Sunday School picnic . They goin ' to lock up the niggers in a black cellar and throw away the key . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close to me . " Abolition , " he said in a voice like a whisper . " Reverend , single-handed you done more with your Christianity to assure the defeat of abolition than all the meddlin ' and pryin ' Quakers that ever set foot in Virginia put together . I reckon you did n't figure on that either ? " " No , " I said , looking into his eyes , " if that be true . No. "  |p114His  voice had risen to a mocking , insistent monotone . " Christianity ! Rapine , plunder , butchery ! Death and destruction ! And misery and suffering for untold generations . That was the accomplishment of your Christianity , Reverend . That was the fruits of your mission . And that was the joyous messageof your faith . Nineteen hundred years of Christian teaching plus a black preacher is all it takes  --  Is all it takes to prove that God is a God dunned lie ! " He rose to his feet , moving briskly now , his voice softer as he spoke , puffing on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got to go . No offense . All in all you 've been pretty fair and square with me . In spite of what I said , I reckon a man has to act according to his own lights , even when he 's the victim of a delusion . Good night , Reverend . I 'll look back in on you . " When he had gone Kitchen brought me a pan of cold pork and hoe cake and a cupful of water , and I sat there in the chill dusk , eating , watching the light fall and fade away against the gray sky to the west . Presently I heard Hark on the other side of the wall , laughing softly . " Dat man sho give you down de country , Nat . What dat man so sweat up about ? " But I did n't reply to Hark , rising instead and shuffling the length of the chain to the window . Over Jerusalem hung a misty nightfall , over the brown and stagnant river and the woods beyond , where the water oak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partakinglike shadows of the somber wintry dusk . In the houses nearby , lamps and lanterns flickered on in yellow flame and far off there was a sound of clattering china and pots and pans and back doors slamming as people went about fixing supper . Way in the distance in some kitchen I could hear a Negro woman singing  --  a weary sound full of toil and drudgery yet the voice rich , strong , soaring : I knows moonrise , I knows star-rise , lay dis body down . . . Already the dusty fall of snow had disappeared ; a rime of frost lay in its place , coating the earth with icy wet pinpricks of dew , criss/crossed by the tracks of squirrels . In chilly promenade two guards with muskets paced round the jail in greatcoats , stamping their feet against the brittle ground . A gust of wind swept through the cell , whistling . I shivered in a spasm of cold and I closed my eyes , listening to the lament of the woman far off , leaning up against the window ledge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longing : As the heart panteth after the water brooks , so panteth my soul after thee , 0 God . My soul thirsteth for God , for the living God . Deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterspouts : all thy waves and thy billows are gone over me . . . For what seemed a long time I stood leaning near the window , my eyes shut tight against the twilight . Maybe he is right , I thought , maybe all was for nothing , maybe worse than nothing , and all I 've done was evil in the sight of God . Maybe he is right and God is dead and gone , which is why I can no longer reach him . . . I opened my eyes again , looking out into the gloaming light , above the woods where wild ducks skimmed southward against a sky as gray as smoke . Yes , I thought , maybe all this is true , otherwise why should God not heed me , why should he not answer ? Still the woman 's rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in de moonlight , walks in de starlight , to lay dis body down . . . Grieving , yet somehow unbending , steadfast , unafraid , the voice rose through the evening like memory , and a gust of wind blew up from the river , dimming the song , rustlingthe trees , then died and became still . I 'll lay in de grave and stretch out my arms . . . Suddenly the voice ceased , and all was quiet . Then what I done was wrong , Lord ? I said . And if what I done was wrong , is there no redemption ? I raised my eyes upward but there was no answer , only the gray impermeable sky and night falling fast over Jerusalem.  |p119ONCE  WHEN I WAS A BOY OF TWELVE OR thereabouts , and living with my mother in the big house at Turner 's Mill , I remember a fat white man who stopped one night and had supper with my owner of that time , Samuel Turner . This traveling man was a bluff , hearty soul with a round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A dealer in farm implements  --  ploughs and harrows , shares and cultivators and the like  --  he traveled up and down the country with several huge wagons and a team of dray horses and a couple of boys to help him , stopping for the night at this or that farm or plantation , wherever he happened to be peddlinghis wares . I no longer recall the man 's name ( if I ever knew it ) but I do remember the season , which was the beginning of spring . Indeed , it was only what this man said about the weather and the season that caused me to remember him at all . For that evening in April , I was serving at the supper table ( I had just recently begun this chore ; there were two older Negroes in attendance , but it was my apprenticeduty alone to replenish the glasses with cider or buttermilk , to pick up whatever fell to the floor , and to shoo away the cat and the dogs ) and I recollect his voice , very loud but genial , as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accent of the North : " No , sir , Mr. Turner , " he was saying , " they is no spring like it in this great land of ours . They is nothing what approaches the full springtide when it hits Vir/ginia . And , sir , they is good reason for this . I have traveled all up and down the seaboard , from the furtherest upper ranges of New England to the hottest part of Georgia , and I know whereof I speak . What makes the Virginia spring surpassing fine ? Sir , it is simply this . It is simply that , whereas in more southern climes the temperature is always so humid that spring comes as no surprise , and whereas in more northerly climes the winter becomes so prolonged that they is no spring at all hardly , but runs smack into summer  --  why , in Virginia , sir , it is unique ! It is ideal ! Nature has conspired so that spring comes in a sudden warm rush ! Alone in the Virginia latitude , sir , is spring like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember this moment with the clarity of a great event which has taken place only seconds ago  --  the breath of spring still in my nostrils , the dusty evening light still vivid and golden , the air filled with voices and the gentle clash of china and silverware . As the traveling man ceases speaking , the clock in the far hallway lets fall six thudding cast-iron notes , which I hear through the soft yet precisely enunciated cadences of Samuel Turner 's own voice : " You are perhaps too complimentary , sir , for spring will soon also bring us a plague of bugs . But the sentiment is well taken , for indeed so far Nature has been kind to us this year . Certainly , I have but rarely seen such ideal conditions for planting . " There is a pause as the sixth and final chime lingers for an instant with a somnolent hum , then dwindles away dully into infinity , while at this same instant I catch sight of myself in the ceiling-high mirror beyond the far sideboard : a skinny undersized pickaninny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bare foot hooked behind the other leg as I stand wobblingand waiting , eyes rolling white with nervous vigilance . And my eyes return quickly to the table as my owner , for the traveling man 's benefit , gestures with his fork in a fond , circular , spacious motion at the family surrounding him : his wife and his widowed sister-in-law , his two young daughtersp121around nineteen or twenty , and his two nephews  --  grown men of twenty-five or more with rectangular , jut-jawed faces and identical thick necks looming above me , their skin creased and reddened with sun and weather . Samuel Turner 's gesture embraces them all ; swallowing a bite , he clears his throat elaborately , then continues with warm humor : " Of course , sir , my family here can hardly be expected to welcomesuch an active time of the year , after a winter of luxuriousidleness . " There is a sound of laughter , and cries of " Oh , Papa ! " and I hear one of the young men call above the suddenclamor : " You slander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wander to the traveling man ; his red , evilly cratered face is crinkled in jollity , and a trickle of gravy threads its way down the side of his chin . Miss Louisa , the eldest of the daughters , smiles in a vague and pretty way , and blushes , and she lets drop her napkin , which I instantly scurry to retrieve , replacing it upon her lap . Now in the twilight the merriment slowly subsides , and the conversation proceeds in easy ruminative rhythms , the women silent , the men alone chatting garrulous and fullmouthedas I circle the table with the china pitcher of foamingcider , then return to my station between the two thickneckednephews , resume my one-legged heron 's stance and slowly turn my gaze out into the evening . Beyond the veranda the pasture slopes away green and undulating toward the pinewoods . On the coarse weedy grass a score of sheep munch placidly in the yellow light , trailed by a collie dog and a small , bowlegged Negro shepherdess . Past them , far down the slope where a log @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see an empty cart drawn by two flop-eared mules , making its last trip of the day from the storehouse to the mill . On the seat of the cart sits a Negro man , a yellow straw hat raked down upon his head . As I watch , I see that the man is trying to scratch his back , first his left arm snaking up from his waist , then his right arm arching down over hisp122shoulder as the black fingers grope in vain for the source of some intolerable itch . Finally , as the mules plod steadily down the slope and the cart ponderously rocks and veers , the man stands up with a lurching motion and scrapes his back cowlike up and down against the sidepost of the cart . For some reason , I find this wonderfully amusing and I suddenly am aware that I am giggling to myself , though not so loudly that the white people may notice . Long moments pass as I watch the cart drift rocking across the margin of the woods , the man seated again as cart and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ axles over the little bridge then around the murky lower rim of the millpond , where two white swans glide stately and soundless , finally vanishing behind the forest-shadowed white shape of the sawmill with its dull and sluggish rasp of metal-tortured timber drifting up faintly through the dusk : hrrush , hrrush . Closer now , the yap of the collie dog starts me out of my daydream , and I turn back to the table and the bright tinklingcollision of china and silver , the traveling man 's voice broadly ingratiating as he speaks to Marse Samuel : " . . . a new line of sundries this year . Now for instance , I have some pure sea salt from the Eastern Shore of Maryland , for preservingand table use only , sir . . . They is nothing better in the market . . . And so you say they is ten people here , including the overseer and his family ? And sixty-eight grown Negroes ? Presuming it goes mostly for salt pork then , sir , I should say five sacks will do you nicely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now again my mind begins to wander . My thoughts stray outdoors once more where the brilliant fuss of chattering birds intrudes in the fading day  --  blackbirds and , robins , finches and squawking jays , and somewhere far off above the bottomlands the noise of some mean assembly of crows , their calls echoing venturesome and conniving and harsh . Again the scene outside captures my attention , so now slowly andp123with irresistible pleasure I turn to gaze at the coarse green slope with its slant of golden light and its nimble bustle of many wings , the flower bed only feet away ferny and damp with the odor of new-turned earth . The little black bowleggedshepherdess has vanished from the pasture , sheep and collie too , leaving behind a haze of dust to tremble in the evening light . Rising on fat whirlpools of air , this haze fills the sky like the finest sawdust . In the distance the mill still rasps with a steady husking noise above the monotonous roar of water from the sluiceway . Two huge dragonflies dart across the evening , wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Worried that my excitement will show , I feel my limbs stretch and quiver with a lazy thrill . A sense of something quickening , a voluptuous stirring courses gently through my flesh . I hear the blood pulsing within me like some imagined wash of warm oceanic tides . In my mind I echo the traveling man 's words  --  Full springtide , spring , spring , I find myself whispering to myself  --  and this awakeningbrings to my lips the shadow of a grin . I feel half stunned , my eyes roll like marbles . I am filled with inexplicable happinessand a sense of tantalizing promise . As the traveling man 's voice drifts back into hearing , I turn again and feel the gaze of my mistress , Miss Nell , upon me , and I look up then and see her mouth forming the whisperedword " cider . " I grasp the heavy pitcher with two hands and again make my circuit of the table , filling the glasses of the women first , taking pains that not a drop is spilled . My care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the table swims dizzily before my eyes . Now finally I am at the elbow of the traveling man , who , as I serve him , ceases his talk of commerce long enough to look down at me and goodnaturedlyexclaim : " Well , I 'll be Burned if that crock ai n't bigger than you are ! " I am only half aware that he is addressingthese words to me , and I am unconcerned as I pour the cider , replace the glass , and continue my tour around thep124table . " Cute little nipper too , " the traveling man adds in an offhand tone , but again I make no connection between myself and what is said until now , drawing near to Miss Nell , I hear her voice , gentle and indulgent as it descends from the rare white prodigous atmosphere above me : " And smart , you would n't believe ! Spell something , Nat . " And then to the traveling man : " Ask him something to spell . " Suddenly I am fastened to my tracks and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am the focus of all eyes . The pitcher in my hands is as heavy as a boulder . He beams down at me ; the radish-red broad cheeks are all benevolence as the man pauses , reflects , then says : " Can you spell lady ' ? " But abruptly , before I can reply , I hear Samuel Turner interrupt , amused : " Oh no , something difficult ! " And the traveling man scratches the side of his pitted face , still beaming : " Oh well , " he says , " let 's see , some kind of flower . . . Columbine . ' Spell ' columbine : " And I spell it , without effort and instantly but in a pounding fury of embarrassment , the pulse roaring in my ears as the letters tumble forth in a galloping rush : " . . . i-n-e , spells columbine ! " And the laughter at the table that follows this , and a shrill echo from the walls , makes me realize in dismay that I am yelling at the top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of unorthodoxy , and considered thus by some , " I hear my master say ( I resume my station , still flustered and with a madly working heart ) , " but it is my conviction that the more religiously and intellectually enlighteneda Negro is made , the better for himself , his master , and the commonweal . But one must begin at a tender age , and thus , sir , you see in Nat the promising beginnings of an experiment . Of course , it is late for this child , compared with white children , yet . . . " As I listen to him speak , not completelycomprehending the words , my panic and embarrassment ( which had been made up in equal parts of childish selfconsciousnessand terror at the thought that I might publicly fail ) diminish , fade away , and in their place I feel stealingp125over me a serene flow of pride and accomplishment : after all , I may have been a loudmouth , but I did know the word , and I sensed in the sunny laughter a laurel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasure I take in my exploit is like a delectableitch within , and though my expression in the mirror is glum , abashed , and my pink lips are persimmon-sour , I can hear my insides stirring . I feel wildly alive . I shiver feverishlyin the glory of self . But I seem to be quickly forgotten , for now the traveling man is again talking of his wares : " It is the Carey plough , sir , of stout cast iron , and I calculate it will supplant all ploughs presently in the market . They has been a big demand for it in the Northern states . . . " Yet even as he talks and my thoughts wander astray again , the proud glow of achievement hangs on , and I am washed by a mood of contentment and snug belonging so precious that I could cry out for the joy of it . Nor does it go away . It is a joy that remains even as the pinewoods begin to crowd ragged trembling shadows into the deserted pasture , and a horn blows far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mill and the distantfields . As abruptly as some interrupted human grumble , the sawmill ceases its harsh rasp and husk , and for a moment the silence is like a loud noise in my ears . Now twilight deepens over the meadow , where bats no bigger than sparrowsare flickering and darting in the dusk , and I can see through the evening shadows in the distance a line of Negro men trooping up from the mill toward the cabins , their faces black and barely visible but their voices rising and falling , wearily playful with intermittent cries of laughter as they move homeward with the languid , shuffling , shoulder-bent gait of a long day 's toil . Snatches of their talk rise up indistinctlyacross the field , sounds of gentle , tired skylarking in the twilight : " Hoo-dar , Simon ! . . . Shee-it , nigger ! . . . Cotch you , fo ' sho ! " Quickly I turn away ( could there have been a whiff of something desperate and ugly in that long file ofp126sweating , weary men which upsets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that April dusk ? ) and circle the table with my pitcher one last time while the two other Negro house servants , Little Morning and Prissy , clear away the dishes and light thick candles on pewter candelabra that fill the darkening room with a pumpkin-hued glow . My master is talking now , his chair pushed back , the thumbs of both hands hooked in the pockets of his vest . He is in his early forties ( to be precise , he will be forty-three at fivethirtyin the morning on the twelfth day of the coming June , according to one or another of the old house servants , who know more about the events in white people 's lives than white people do themselves ) but he looks older  --  perhaps only to me , however , since I hold him in such awe that I am forced to regard him , physically as well as spiritually , in terms of the same patriarchal and venerable grandeur that glows forth from those Bible pictures of Moses on the mount , or an ancientElijah exploding in bearded triumph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around his mouth are early ; he has worked hard , and this accounts for those lines and for the cheek whiskers which end in small tufts whiter than a cottontail 's butt . " Ugly as a mushrat , " my mother has said of him , and perhaps this is true : the angular face is too long and horselike , the nose too prominent and beaked , and , as my mother also has observed , " Lawd did n't leave Marse Sam a whole lot of jawbone . " So much for my master 's chin . But his eyes are kindly , shrewd , luminous ; there is still strength in his face , tempered by a curious , abiding sweetness that causes him ever to seem on the verge of a rueful smile . At this time , my regard for him is very close to the feeling one should bear only toward the Divinity . " Let us adjourn to the veranda , " he says to the traveling man , pushing back his chair . " We usually retire more or less promptly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bottle ofp127port while we make out a requisition for my needs . " His hand falls lightly on the shoulder of the traveling man , who is rising now . " I hope you will forgive me if it sounds presumptuous , " he continues , " and it is a most unusual thing for me to say , but for a peddler who has the difficulties of so much travel , you sell an extremely reliable line of wares . And this , sir , as you must be aware , is of the greatest importance in a region like ours , removed so far from the centers of commerce . Since last year I have taken the opportunity of commending you to my friends . " The traveling man shines with pleasure , wheezing a little as he bows to the women and the young men , then moves on toward the door . " Well , thank you , sir ... " he begins , but my owner 's voice interrupts , not rude , not even abrupt , but in continuation of his praise : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been in the past . And what did you say was your tomorrow 's destination ? GreensvilleCounty ? Then you must stop by Robert Munson 's place on the Meherrin River . . . " The voices fade , and while I busy myself around the table , helping the old man Little Morning and the youngwoman Prissy clear the dishes , the rest of the family rises , slowly scattering in the last brief hours before bedtime : the two nephews to attend to a mare ready to foal , Miss Nell to take a poultice to a sick Negro child in the cabins , the three other women  --  all astir with gay anticipation as they bustle toward the parlor  --  to read aloud from something they call Marmion . Then these voices too fade away , and I am back in the kitchen again amid the clumping of crudely shod Negro feet and the sharp stench of a ham hock steaming on the stove , back with my tall , beautiful mother banging and grumbling in a swirl of greasy smoke  --  " ' Thaniel , you better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ! " she calls to me  --  back in my black Negro world .. . But that evening in the early darkness while I lie awake on my straw bed , the word columbine is like a lullaby on myp128tongue . I caress the word , whispering it over and over again , letting each letter form its own shape , as if suspended magicallyabove me in the night . I lie at the drowsy edge of sleep , listening to the sounds of evening , to the feathery fuss and clumsy stir of chickens in their shed , a far-off howling dog , and from the millpond a steady passionate shrilling of frogs numberless as stars . All around me the smell of manure is rank and strong like the earth itself . Presently I hear my mother 's footsteps as she moves with a tired slat-slat of bare calloused feet from the kitchen , enters our tiny room , and lies down beside me in the dark . Almost at once she is fast asleep , breathing in a gentle rhythm , and I reach out and lightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make certain that she is there . Then at last the spring night enfolds me as if with swamp and cedar and with drowsy remembrance , and dimly I hear a whippoorwill call through the dark , the word columbine still on my lips as I sink away into some strange dream filled with inchoate promise and a voiceless , hoveringjoY . It was memories like this which stayed with me all through the few days left until my death . During the night just after the trial I came down with some kind of fever , and when I awoke the next morning my arms and legs were trembling with the cold , even though I was soaked in sweat and my head was afire and swollen with pain . The wind had risen and in the sunless morning light , pale as water ; a blast of cold air howled through the open window , bringing with it a storm of gritty dust and pine needles and flying leaves . I started to call out to Kitchen , to ask him to fetch a blanket to stop up the window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet : the white boy was still too scared of me even to answer . So again I lay back against the plank , shivering , and fell into a feverish doze when once more I was lying in the little boat , my spirit filled with a familiar yet mysterious peace as Ip129drifted through the afternoon quiet of some wide and sunlit river toward the sea . In the distance I heard the ocean boomingwith the sound of mighty unseen breakers crashing on the shore . Far above me on its promontory stood the white temple , as ever serene and solitary and majestic , the sunlight bathing it as if with the glow of some great mystery as I moved on downriver past it , without fear , to the sandy cape and the tumultuous groaning sea . . . Then this vision glimmeredout and I awoke , raging with fever , and I fell asleep again , only to awake sometime later in the day with the fever diminishing and my brow cold and dry and the remnant of something frail and unutterably sweet , like a bird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after this the fever commenced again and my mind was a wash and flow of nightmares , nightmares filled with unending moments of suffocation .. . And so in this way , between waking and oblivion , with these reveries , voices , recollections , I passed the days and nights before the day of my execution .. . My mother 's mother was a girl of the Coromantee tribe from the Gold Coast , thirteen years old when she was brought in chains to Yorktown aboard a schooner sailing out of Newport , Rhode Island , and only a few months older when she was sold at auction beneath a huge live oak tree in the harborside town of Hampton , to Alpheus Turner , who was Samuel Turner 's father . I never laid eyes on my grandmother  --  nor for that matter a Coromantee girl  --  but over the years I heard about her and her kind , and in my mind 's eye it is easy to see her as she squats beneath the live oak tree so many years ago , swelled up with child , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Alpheus Turner 's approach to reveala mouth full of filed teeth and raised tattoos like whorls of scattered birdshot on her cheeks , patterns blacker even than her tar-black skin . Who knows what she is thinking atp130the moment Turner draws near ? Although his face is illuminedby a beneficent smile , to her it is a fiendish smirk , and besides he is white , white as bone or skulls or deadwood , whiter than those malevolent ancestral ghosts that prowl the African night . And his voice is the voice of a ghoul . " Gnah ! " he roars as he touches her , feeling the soundness of her limbs . " Fwagh ! " He is saying only " Good ! " and " Fine ! " to the trader , but in her terror she believes she is about to be eaten . Thepoor thing nearly takes leave of her senses . She falls from her perch on the block and her mind reels back in space and time toward some childhood jungle memory of warm , enveloping peace . As she lies asprawl , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witch doctor 's jabber of disconnected croaking sounds , having to do with ritual chops and stews . " They all take such fright , Mr. Turner , never mind ! A fine little heifer ! Aye , look at them fat tits ! Look how they spring ! I 'll wager she pops a ten-pound boy ! " But that same summer it was my mother who was born ( publicly begat upon the same slave ship by some unknown black father ) and it became well known around Turner 's Mill that when my young grandmother  --  who by this time had been driven crazy by her baffling captivity  --  gave birth to my mother , she was sent into a frenzy , and when presented with the babe , tried to tear it to pieces . I expect that if my grandmother had not died soon after this , I would have later become a field or timber hand at the Turner place , or maybe a mill hand , which was only a small cut better . But on account of my grandmother I was lucky and became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mother 's birth , refusing to eat , falling into a stupor until the moment of her last breath , when it was said that the black skin turned to the gray of ashes , collapsing in upon the inhabiting bones until the body of the child ( for that is what she was ) seemed so fragile as to be almostp131weightless , like a whitened , burnt-out stick of lightwood ready to crumble at the softest touch . For years there was a cedar headboard in the Negro graveyard , not far from the mill , with carved letters which read : " TIG " AET . 13BORN ANHEATHENDIED BAPTISEDIN CHRISTA.D. 1 782R.I.P . That graveyard is in an abandoned corner of a meadow , hard by a scrubby grove of juniper trees and loblolly pine . A plain pole fence , dilapidated to begin with but long since fallen into splintery ruin , sets off the place from the rest of the field ; many of the headboards have toppled over to rot and mingle with the loamy earth , while in the spring those that remain become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skunk cabbage and cinnamon fern and a prickly tangle of jimson weed . In the summer the underbrush grows so thickly that you can no longer see the mounds where the Negroes are laid to rest . Grasshoppers sail through the weeds with small scaly whickerings , and ever so often a blacksnake slithers among the green , and on August days the odor is ripe and rank and very close , like a hot handful of grass . " How come you all de time studyin ' dat grabeyard , ' Thaniel ? " my mother says . " Ai n't no place fo ' chillun to go studyin ' ' bout . " And it is true : most of the Negroes avoid the place , filled with superstitious dread , and this in some measure ( the rest being lack of time ; attention to the dead requires leisure ) is the reason for the unsightly disrepair . But there is a leftoversavage part of me that feels very close to my grandmother , and for a couple of years I am drawn irresistiblyp132back to the graveyard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hot break after midday dinner , as if seeking among all those toppled and crumbling wood markers with their roll call of sweetly docile and abbreviated names like so many perished spaniels  --  " Peak " and " Lulu " and " Yellow Jake "  --  some early lesson in mortality . How strange it is , after all , at age thirteen to ponder the last resting place of your own grandmother , dead at thirteen herself .. . But the next spring it is all gone . A new graveyard will be laid out at the edge of the woods , but before that  --  because it is drained and level and easy to get at  --  even this tiny remnantof crop land is needed , to raise sweet potatoes . I am filled with wonderment at how quickly the graveyard vanishes . It takes less than half a morning  --  burnt off by a gang of black field hands with casks of turpentine and blazing pine fagots , the weatherworn cedar headboards consumed by flame , the dry underbrush crackling and hissing as the bugs spring up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cooling black char leveled down by mule team and harrow , so that nothing remains of " Tig , " not the faintest trace nor any vestige of the rest  --  of the muscle , sleep , laughter , footsteps , grimy toil and singing and madness of all those black unremembered servitors whose shaken bones and dust , joiningmy grandmother 's in the general clutter underground , are now made to complete the richness of the earth . Only when I hear a voice  --  the voice of a Negro man , an old field hand standing by amid the swirling smoke , slope-shouldered , looselipped , grinning with a mouthful of blue gums , gabbling in that thick gluey cornfield accent I have learned to despise : " Dem old dead peoples is sho gwine grow a nice passel of yams ! "  --  only when I hear this voice do I begin to realize , for nearly the very first time , what the true value of black folk is , not just for white men but for niggers . So because my mother was motherless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into his own home ,  |p133where  she was reared by a succession of black aunts and grannies who taught her nigger-English and some respectable graces and where , when she grew old enough , she became a scullery maid and then a cook , and a good cook to boot . Her name was Lou-Ann , and she died when I was fifteen , of some kind of tumor . But I am ahead of myself . What matters here is that the same happenstance that caused my mother to be brought up in Alpheus Turner 's house caused me in the course of events to become a house nigger , too . And that may or may not have been a fortunate circumstance , depending upon how you view what came to pass in Jerusalem so many years later . " Quit pesterin ' ' bout yo ' daddy , " says my mother . " What make you think I knows where he done run off to ? What his name ? I done tol you dat twenty times . He name Nathaniel jes ' like you ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bout yo ' daddy ! When he run off ? When de las ' time I seen him ? Law me , chile , dat so long ago I ai n't got no reelection . Les ' see . Well , Marse Alpheus he died ' leven years ago , bless his name .

Ai n't no black man goin ' runp134off less'n he 's angered ! Why ? How I know ? I don ' know nothin " bout dat mess . Well , awright , den , if you really wants to know , ' t was on account of Marse Benjamin . Like I tol ' you , when Marse Alpheus die ' t was Marse Benjamin come to own ev'ything on account of he was de oldest son .

Anyways , one evenin ' yo ' daddy he buttlin ' at de table an ' he do somethin ' dat Marse Benjamin think ai n't quite right an ' he hollers at yo ' daddy . Well , yo ' daddy he ai n't used to havin ' no one holler at him like dat , an ' he turns aroun ' still smilin ' , see  --  he alwayssmilin ' , dat man  --  an ' he mock Marse Benjamin right back .

" Two hundred yards or so behind the room where my mother and I stay , at the end of a path through the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servants and the mill hands living in the compound of cabins near the big house . Sturdily built of oak and set above the steeply sloping bank of a wooded ravine , the privy is divided by a board partition ; five holes are for women and small children , the other five are for the men . Because the big house is isolatedfrom mill and field , and because the affairs of house servants transpire as if in a world apart , this privy is one of the few places where my daily life intersects with the lives of those Negroes who already I have come to think of as a lowerp136order of people  --  a ragtag mob , coarse , raucous , clownish , uncouth . For even now as a child I am contemptuous and aloof , filled with disdain for the black riffraff which dwells beyond the close perimeter of the big house  --  the faceless and nameless toilers who at daybreak vanish into the depths of the mill or into the fields beyond the woods , returning like shadows at sundown to occupy their cabins like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my way of thinking is due to my mother . It is the plague of her life that amidst so many other comparative comforts she must still make that regular trek to the edge of the ravine and there mingle with the noisy rabble so beneath her . " Hit 's a shame in dis world , " she fusses to Prissy . " Us folks in de house is quality ! And we ai n't got no outhouse for our own selfs , hit 's a cryin ' shame ! I 'll vow dem cornfield niggers is de akshul limit . Ev'y one dem chillun dey lets pee on de seat , and don ' none of ' em close down dem lids , so 's it stinks like misery . Druther go to de privy settin " longside some ole sow dan one dem cornfield nigger womans ! Us house folks is quality ! " Equally disdainful , I avoid the morning rush , training my bowels to obey a later call when I can enjoy some privacy . The earth around the entrance to the men 's side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is bare of vegetation , black hard clay worn glossy smooth by the trample of numberless bare or broganed feet , imprinted daily with a shifting pattern of booted heels and naked toes . Designed to prevent either malingering or seclusion  --  like the doors to all places frequentedby Negroes  --  the privy door too is lockless , latchless , swinging outward easily on leather hinges to reveal the closet within drowned in shadows , almost completely dark save for slivers of light stealing in through the cracks between the timbers . I am used to the odor , which is ripe , pungent , immediate , smothering my nose and mouth like a warm green hand , the excremental stench partly stifled by quicklime , so that the smell is not so much repellent to me as endurable ,  |p137faintly  sweetish like stagnant swampwater . I raise one oval lid and seat myself on the pine plank above the hole . Between my thighs light floods up from the slope of the ravine and I look downward at the vast brown stain splashed with the white of quicklime . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and calm of morning . Outside , somewhere in the woods , a mockingbird begins a chant which ripples and flows like rushing water , ceases , commences again , falls ineffable and pure through the tangle of grapevine and the honeysuckleand the tree-shadowed thickets of ivy and fern . Here within , amid the sun-splashed gloom , I relieve myself in pleasant unhurried spasms , contemplating a blackberry-sized spider weaving in one corner of the ceiling a thick web which shakes , stretches , trembles in milky agitation . Now through the walls of the privy , from the distant back porch of the big house , I hear my mother calling . " ' Thaniel ! " she cries . " You , Nathaniel ! Nathan-yet ! You , boy ! Better came on here ! " I have dallied too long , she wants me near the kitchen to fetch water . " Nathaniel Turner ! You , boy ! " she cries . The mood of contentment dwindles away , the morning ritual nears its end . I reach out toward a tattered sack on the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a sudden a searing heat seizes me from underneath ; my bare bottom and balls feel set on fire and I leap up from the seat with a howl , clutching at my scorched nether parts while smoke floats up through the hole in a greasy white billow . " Ow ! Ow ! Daggone ! " I shout , but it is mainly from surprise  --  surprise and mortification . For even as I cry out , the pain diminishes and I gaze back down through the hole , beholding the grinning light-brown face of a boy my age . He stands off at the edge of the mire below , grasping in one hand a blazing stick . With his other hand he is clutching his stomachin an agony of delight , and his laughter is high , loud , irrepressible . " Daggone you , Wash ! " I yell . " Jest daggone yo ' no-good black soul ! " But my rage is in vain , and Wash keepsp138laughing , doubled up amid the honeysuckle . It is the third time in as many months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one but myself to blame for my humiliation .

Good morrow , my good neighbour , Mr. Attentive ; whither are you walking so early this morning ? Methinks you look as if you were concerned about something more than ordinary . Have you lost any of your cattle , or what is the matter ? Q ATTENTIVE . Good sir , good morrow to you . I have not as yet lost aught , but yet you give a right guess of me , for I am , as you say , concerned in my heart , but it is because of the badness of the times . And , Sir , you , as all our neighbours know , are a very observing man , pray , therefore , what do you think of them ? Q WISE .

It is a folly to look for good days so long as sin is so high , and those that study its nourishment so many . . . The life of a little nigger child is dull beyond recounting . But during one summer month when I am nine or ten a cou/ple of curious events happen to me , one causing me the bitterestanguish , the other premonitions of joy . It is midmorning in August , hot and stifling , so airless that the dust-stained trees along the edge of the distant woods hang limp and still , and the grinding of the mill seems blurred , indistinct , as if borne sluggishly through heat waves trembling like water above the steaming earth . High in the blue heavens , buzzards by the score wheel and tilt and swoop in effortless flight over the bottomlands , and I lift my eyes from time to time to follow their somber course across the sky . I squat in the shadow of the little room projecting from the kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen comes the odor of collard greens cooking , the smell faintly bitter and pungent ; midday dinner is far off , I feel my insides churning with hunger . Although I am not underfed ( to be the child of the cook is to be , as my mother constantly points out , the " luckiest little nigger ' live " ) I seem nonetheless to exist at the edge of famine . On the sill of the kitchen window above me , a row of muskmelons , half a dozen pale globes , stand ripening in the shade , unattainable as gold . I consider them gravely and with a yearning that brings water to my eyes , knowing that even to touch one of them would fetch upon me calamity like the crack of doom . Once I stole a pot of clabber cheese , and the walloping my mother gave me left me sore as a carbuncle . It is my duty to wait here near the door , to carry water and bring up things from the cellar , to run errands for my mother whenever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is a slack moment in the year when the corn crop has been laid by awaiting harvest and the mill works at half-time . During such a lull it has always been the custom of the brothers Turner , together with their wives and children , to make their annual trip to Richmond , leaving the place for a week or so in the hands of the overseer . Since with the family away my mother has only to cook for ourselves and the house servants  --  Prissy and Little Morning and Weaver and Pleas/ant  --  time hangs heavy for me , and the boredom is like a knife-edge at the back of my skull . It is not an unusual situation , because for a Negro child , denied the pleasures of schooling , there is generally nothing to do , nothing at all ; reading no books , taught no real games , until twelve or so too small to work , black children exist in a monotony like that of yearling mules at pasture , absorbing the sun , feeding , putting on flesh , all unaware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harness , chain , and traces . My own condition is more than unusually solitary , since the Turner children with whom I might ordinarily be expected to play are a good deal older than I , and either help run the plantation or are off at school ; at the same time , I feel myself set apart from the other Negro children , the children of the field hands and mill hands who are so scorned by my mother . Even Wash ( who is the son of one of the two Negro drivers , Abraham  --  almost the only Turner slave with any responsibility at all ) I have drawn away from as I have grown older , in spite of the fact that his circumstances put him a notch above the common cornfield type . At six or seven we played crude games together  --  climbed trees , hunted for caves in the dark ravine , swung on grapevines at the edge of the woods . Leaning over the brink of the ravine , we tried to see who could pee the farthest . Once we stood in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black arms outstretched , in self-inflicted torture , marveled as a swarm of fat mosquitoes engorged themselves on our blood , finally dropping to earth like tiny red grapes . We built a fort of mud and then smeared our naked bodies with the liquid clay ; drying , it became encrusted , a dull calcimine , ghostly , and we howled in mad delight at our resemblance to . white boys . Once we dared to steal ripe persimmons from the tree growingbehind Wash 's cabin , and were caught in the act by his mother  --  a light West Indian woman , part Creole , with black ringlets around her head like writhing wet serpents  --  and were thrashed with a sassafras switch until the welts stood up141on our legs . Wash 's sister had a doll that Abraham had made for her ; fashioned of jute sacking , its head was an old split maple doorknob . Whether it was meant to be a white baby or a nigger child I could never tell , but I regarded it with wonder ; aside from a cast-off cracked wooden top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was the first toy I can remember . On gray winter days when rain streamed from the heavens , Wash and I crouched in the poultry shed , with pointed sticks tracing patterns upon the white damp crust of chickenshit . For a while it became my favorite kind of play . I drew rectangles , circles , squares , and I marveled at the way two triangles placed together in a certainway formed that mysterious star I had seen so often when ( curiosity getting the better of me as I trailed my mother through Samuel Turner 's library ) I risked a glimpse of the pictures in a gigantic Bible : I scratched this design over and over again on the limecool , bittersweet-smelling white floor of the chicken shed , a hundred interlocking stars engraved in the dust , quite heedlessof Wash , who stirred and fidgeted and mumbled to himself , bored quickly , unable to draw anything but aimless lines . But these were dumb little games , the brainless play of kittens . As I grow older now there steals over me the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So near to the white people , I absorb their language daily . I am a tireless eavesdropper , and their talk and comment , even their style of laughter , vibrates endlessly in my imagination . Already my mother teases me for the way I parrot whitep142folks ' talk  --  teases me with pride . Wash is molded by differentsounds  --  even now I am aware of this  --  nigger voices striving clumsily to grapple with a language never taught , never really learned , still alien and unknown . With such a poor crippled tongue , Wash 's way of speaking comes to seem to me a hopeless garble , his mind a tangle of baby-thoughts ; so gradually that I barely know it , this playmate floats away out of my consciousness , dwarfish and forgotten , as I settle deep into my own silent , ceaselessly vigilant , racking solitude . I can not as yet read The Life and Death of Mr. Badman , not even the title ; my possession of it terrifies me , because I have stolen it , yet at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with such insupportable excitement that I can feel a loosening in my bowels . ( Although I have come late to the joys of reading and still can not properly " read , " I have known the crude shapes of simple words ever since I was six , when Samuel Turner , a methodical , tidy , and organized master , and long impatient with baking alum turning into white flour and cinnamon being confused with nutmeg , and vice versa , set about labeling every chest and jar and canister and keg and bag in the huge cellar beneath the kitchen where my mother dispatched me hourly every day . It seemed not to matter to him that upon the Negroes  --  none of whom could read  --  these hieroglyphs in red paint would have no effect at all : still Little Morning would be forced to dip a probing brown finger in the keg plainly marked MOLASSES , and even so there would be lapses , with salt served to sweeten the breakfast tea . Nonetheless , the system satisfied Samuel Turner'ssense of order , and although at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plain letters outlined by the glow of an oil lamp in the chill vault served as my first and only primer . It was a great leap from MINT and CITRON and SALTPETRE and BACON to The Life and Death of Mr. Badman , but there exists both a frustration and a surfeitp143when one 's entire literature is the hundred labels in a dim cellar , and my desire to possess the book overwhelmed my fear . Even so , it had been a dismal moment . In Samuel Turner 's library , where my mother had gone to fetch a new silver ladle for the kitchen , the books had been locked up behind wire , row after row of lustrous leather-swaddled volumes imprisoned as in a cage . On the morning I accompaniedher there , I lingered long enough to be captured by the sight of two volumes , almost exactly alike in size and shape , lying together on a table . Opening one of them , seeing that it was aswarm with words , I was seized with the old queasy excitement in my guts , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , so that later that day I crept back to the library and took the book , covering it with a flour sack and leaving behind its companion  --  something which I later learned was called Grace Abounding . Just as I had expected , and to my wild anxiety , the fact that the book was missing was gossiped throughout the house . Yet I was not alarmed as I might have been , since I think I must have instinctively reasoned that although white people will rightly suspect a nigger of taking almost anything that is not nailed down , they would certainly not suspect him of taking a book . ) This morning , squatting in the shadow of the kitchen , I think longingly of The Life and Death of Mr. Badman , wondering if I can summon the courage to remove it from its hiding place and try to read it without being found out . FinallyI get up and sidle toward the place where it is hidden . I have stored the book underneath the house  --  part of which is elevated above the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the great oak sills . There spiders stir in the gloom and in the dim light hundreds of flying ants swarm in a pale flutter of brownish transparent wings . Protected by its flour sack , The Life and Death of Mr. Badman reposes in the dark . I creep forward on my knees a yard or so , reach up andp144remove the sack , then inch back toward the edge of the house where a splash of sunshine falls on the damp bare earth . Here I turn about and sit down with my legs crossed . I open the book and sunlight floods the white page , hurting my eyes . It is cool here , with a ferny smell of dampness , and mosquitoes moon about my ears as I begin my laborious journey through a wild strange country where words of enraging size , black and incomprehensible , blossom like poisonous flowers . My lips move silently , I trace sentences with a quivering finger . Thick words with mysterious syllables , lugubrious and fathomless , obstruct my way like great logs and boulders ; small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I press on in despair , searching for the key , hunting for the soft and sweetly familiar , SUGAR , GINGER , CAPSICUM , CLOVES . Suddenly I hear footsteps stamping up the dirt path from the cabins and I draw back underneath the house , hidden again , watching . It is the black driver , Abraham . A stout , muscular Negro , very dark , he is dressed in the green denim shirt which is the badge of his authority ; he hurries along up the path , sweating in the fierce morning heat , a set , stern , indignant look frozen on his face as his broganed feet tramp the ground inches from where I lay in hiding and then clatter up the back steps into the kitchen . Moments pass and I am aware of nothing . Soon I steal out toward the patch of sunlightagain , preparing myself to read , when now I hear voices from up above , in the alcove between the kitchen and the pantry . Abraham is talking to my mother and his tone is agitated , tense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is saying , " you better jes ' had , LouAnn . Dat man he mean as pizen ! I knows . You better light on out ob here ! " " Shoot , " I hear my mother say , " dat man ai n't no trouble . He gib me a bad time an ' I smack him one wid dis yere kettle  --  " " But you ai n't seed him dis time ! " Abraham breaks in . " Hep145worse'n I ever seed ! An ' ai n't no fambly folks aroun ' to say ary word ! l jes ' tellin ' you , Lou-Ann , dat 's all I got to say ! " " Shoot , he ai n't goin ' gib Lou-Ann no bad time . Leastwise not today ... " I hear them move from the alcove , the footsteps shuffling on the timbers above my head , their voices becoming indistinct . Presently they are silent and then I hear the door slam open and Abraham 's heavy tread as he thunders down the back stoop and past me once more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half trotting now in the direction of the mill . The mystery , and my perplexity , last only a moment . As soon as Abraham has vanished around the corner of the stable , I sidle out on my behind again to the edge of the house , throwing open the book . The morning is still once more . While I bend my head down to study the open page , my mother begins to sweep in the kitchen above . I hear the steady whisk-whisk of the straw broom on the floor , then the sound of her voice , so faint that I can barely make it out , as she commences a lonesome song . " Bow low , Mary , bow low , Martha , For Jesus come and lock de do ' , An ' carry de keys away ... " The song lulls and distracts me , draws me away for a moment from the maddening printed lines . I listen to her sing , and my head falls slowly against a cedar post of the house while I gaze away drowsily at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swamp , the Negro cabins below them somnolent in the morning heat , and high above all the buzzards in patient and unceasing soar and swoop and meditation , a noiseless quivering tilt of black wings over some dying thing fallen in the far-off woods , haplessand struggling . Nearby , two Negroes with a wagonless mule team shamble up from the woods toward the mill . I hear their laughter and the jingle of a harness , and they passp146out of sight . Once again I smell the collard greens steaming ; hunger swells inside me , then hopelessly dies . " Bow low , Mary , bow low , Martha , " my mother sings , rich now , and far , and I let my eyelids close together , and soon I seem to be in a kitchen  --  is it this one I know so well ?  --  at Christmas , and I hear the voice of some white mistress ( Miss Elizabeth ? Miss Nell ? ) calling out Christmas gift ! in a cheery voice , and I drink the sweet eggnog descending to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to assuage my hunger . Then Christmas fades away and I am in a honeysuckle glade , filled with the bumbling hum of bees . Wash is with me , and together we watch a horde of Negroes laboring with hoes in a steaming field of young corn . Like animals , glistening with sweat , brown backs shining mirror-bright beneath the blazingsun , they ply their hoes in unison , chop-chopping beneath the eyes of a black driver . The sight of their dumb toil fills me with a sickening dread . Huge and brawny , the driver looks like Abraham , even though he is not Abraham , and now he spies Wash and me and , turning about , comes toward us . Gwine git me two little nigger boys , he says , smiling , Gwine git me two little boys to chop de corn . Terror sweeps through me . Voiceless , in mad flight , I plunge through the honeysuckle , treading air as if across empty space back through a sunlit morning toward the refuge of the kitchen looming near , where now a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me with a different fright . My eyes fly open and I crouch forward beneath the house , alert , listening , heart pounding . " Gwan outa here ! " my mother cries . " Gwan away ! I ai n't havin ' no truck with you ! " Her voice is shrill , angry , but edged with fear , and I can no longer understand the words as she moves to another part of the room above . Now I hear another voice , this one a man 's deep grumble , thick and somehow familiar , but speaking words I am unable to make out as I scramble to my feet at the edge of the house andp147stand there listening . Again my mother says something , insistent , still touched with fear , but her voice is blotted out by the man 's grumble , louder now , almost a roar . Suddenly my mother 's voice is like a moan , a single long plaintive wail across the morning silence , making my scalp tingle . In panic , wishing to rush away but at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mother 's side , I run around the corner of the house and up the back stoop , throwing open the kitchen door . " There , God damn , yell have a taste of me big greasy , " says a voice in the shadows , and though I am blinded by the sudden darkness , seeing only two blurred shapes wrestling together near the pantry , I now know who the voice belongs to . It is the white man named McBride  --  since winter the overseer of the fields  --  a yeasty-faced , moody Irishman with a shock of oily black hair and a bad limp , also a drunkard who has whipped Negroes despite the Turner brothers ' rules to the contrary . My mother is still moaning , and I can hear McBride 's stringy breathing , loud and laboredlike that of a hound dog after a run . Blinking , my eyes take in the scene , and I am aware at once of two things : of the fruity odor of apple brandy from a bottle shattered into splinters on the kitchen floor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaft of sunlight , clutched in McBride 's hand and flourished like a dagger at my mother 's neck . She is on her back upon a table in the pantry , supporting the full weight of the overseer , who with his other hand fumbles and fights with her clothes and his own . I stand rooted at the door , unable to move . The jagged neck of the bottle clatters to the floor , shattering in a powder like greenish snow . All at once a kind of shudder passes through my mother 's body , and the moan is a different moan , tinged with urgency , and I do not know whether the sound I hear now is the merest whisper of a giggle ( " Uh-huh , awright , " she seems to murmur ) for McBride 's voice , thick and excited , obliterates her own  --  " There now , me beauty , yellp148have earrings , " the words an awful sigh  --  and he makes a quick convulsive motion , while her brown long legs go up swiftly to embrace his waist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that same strange and brutal rhythm I have witnessedwith Wash through the cracks of half a dozen cabins and which in the madness of complete innocence I had thought was the pastime , or habit , or obsession , or something , of niggers alone . I fly from the house , headed for nowhere ; my only notion is to keep running . Around the stable I scamper , past the weaver 's shed , past the smokehouse and the blacksmith shop , where two ancient black codgers idling in the shade gaze at me in slow wonder . On around the barn I run , faster and faster , across the edge of the apple orchard and along the other side of the house through a shimmering white spider web that clings to my face in damp feathery strands . A stone punctures my bare toe in a tiny starburst of pain , but nothing hinders my flight ; I am bound for the ends of the earth . A hedgerow blocks my way ; I plunge through it , alighting upon a stretch of sunblasted brown lawn above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the petals of daisies , swooping up now to escape me . With pinwheeling legs , flailing arms , I hurdle a new ditch and commence rushingdown the ailanthus-shaded lane leading to the country road when now , abruptly , my pace slackens , I begin a slow dogtrot which in turn becomes a walk , feet scuffing along . Finally I stop in my tracks , staring at the forest rising up like an impenetrable green wall beyond the fields . There is no place to go . For long moments I stand in the shade beneath the ailanthus trees , panting , waiting . It is hot and still . Far off , the mill rumbles in a dull undertone , so faint I can barely hear it . Insects stir and fidget among the weeds , their swift random industry like a constant stitching noise amid the heat . I stand and wait for a long time , unable to go farther , unablep149to move . Then at last I turn and slowly retrace my steps up the lane and across the lawn in front of the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rag mop on the veranda , will not see me  --  and now cautiously I part the brittlesticks and branches of the parched hedge , slipping sidewaysthrough it , and then dawdle across the lot to the kitchen . As I come back to my hiding place beneath the house , the door of the kitchen smacks open with a clatter and McBride appears on the rear stoop , blinking in the sunlight , running a hand through his black disheveled hair . He does not see me as I creep back under the house , watching . he blinks steadily , and with his other hand he adjusts one gallus on his shoulder , then runs his fingers over his mouth  --  a curious , tentative motion almost of discovery , as if touching his lips for the first time . Then a slow and lazy smile steals over his face and he lurches down the steps , missing the last one or not fully connectingwith it , so that the heel of his boot makes a sudden popping noise against the timber while at the same instant he sprawls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , muttering " God blast ! " Yet he is still smiling , and now I can see that he has caught sight of Abraham , who just at this moment is rounding the corner of the stable . " Abe ! " he shouts . " You , Abe ! " " Yassuh ! " I hear the voice call back . " They 's ten hands pickin ' worms down in the bottom corn-field ! " " Yas , Mistah Mac ! " " Well , you fetch they black asses out of there , hear me ! " " Yas , Mistah Mac ! Ah do dat ! " " Hit 's too hot even for niggers ! " " Yassuh ! " Abraham turns and hustles down the slope , his green shirt plastered black with sweat against his shoulders . Then he is gone and it is McBride alone who seems to fill the entire space within my sight , prodigious even as he standsp150weaving , grinning to himself in the blighted , sun-baked yard , prodigious and all-powerful , yet mysterious in his terrible authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round , heavy face , uplifted to the sun in dreamy pleasure , sickens me inside , and I feel a sense of my weakness , my smallness , my defenselessness , my niggerness invading me like a wind to the marrow of my bones . " God blast ! " he says finally , with baffling glee , and lets out a , soft happy cry , totters a bit , and fetches his booted foot up against the remains of a decayed bucket , which flies off in splinters across the yard . In dismay , a great old hen squawks , flees toward the shed , and a cloud of snuff-brown barnyard manure floats aloft like the finest powder , amid tiny pinfeathersbursting everywhere . " God blast ! " McBride says again , in a kind of low shout , and he is off and away , limping , in the direction of his own house down the slope . God blast ! Like something shriveled , I draw up within myself underneaththe kitchen , the book shut now as I clutch it to my chest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the air . Presently I hear my mother 's feet on the floor above , the broom whisking against the boards , her voice again , gentle , lonesome , unperturbed and serene as before . " For Jesus come and lock de do ' An ' carry de keys away ... " On another morning later that same month , the rain comes down in great whistling cataracts , whipped into spray by a westerly wind and accompanied by cracklings of lightningand thunder . Fearful for the book 's safety , I rescue it from its precarious shelf beneath the house and steal up the kitchen steps , taking refuge in the pantry behind a barrel of cider . Outside the storm rages but there is enough light to see by , and I crouch in the apple-sweet damp with the book thrown open upon my knees . The minutes pass , my legs growp151numb beneath me . The book with its ant-swarm of words is like an enemy , malevolent , wearisome , incomprehensible . I draw taut , crucified on a rack of boredom , yet I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lacking the key to unlock it , I possess that treasure nonetheless , and so with grubby fingers and gritty eyes I persevere .. . All at once , very close to me , there is a noise like a thunderclapand I give a jump , fearful that the house has been hit by lightning . But now as I look up I see that it is only the great cedar door to the pantry which has been thrown violentlyopen , flooding the room with a yellowish chill light ; at the entry stands the tall , stoop-shouldered , threatening shape of Little Morning , his bloodshot eyes in a leathery old mean wrinkled face gazing down at me with fierce indignation and rebuke . " Dar , boy ! " he says in a hoarse whisper . " Dar ! I done foun ' you out at last ! You de one dat stole dat book , lak I figured all de time ! " ( How could I have known then what I realized much later : that with suspicion founded upon the simplest envy , he had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , simple-headed and unlettered and in the true state of nigger ignorance for a lifetime , had been sent into a fit of intolerable jealousy upon his realization that a tenyear-oldblack boy was going through the motions of learning to read . For that was the uncomplicated fact of the matter , doubtless dating from the time when , correcting him , watching him haul up from the cellar a keg of MOLASSES instead of the keg of OIL he had been ordered to fetch , I had answered his haughty How you know ? with a superior Be-cause it say so , leaving him flabbergasted , spiteful , and hurt . ) Before I can reply or even move , Little Morning has my ear pinched between his thumb and forefinger , and in this way hoists me to my feet , propelling me out of the pantry and into the kitchen , pulling me forward and with an insistent pinch and tug stretching the skin of my skull as he stalks down the hallway . In helpless tow , I flounder after him , the book clutched against my chest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face ; the old man utters hoarse indignantbreaths , huffanapuff huffanapuff , mingled with threats chilling , dire : " Marse Samuel gwine fix you , boy ! Marse Samuel gwine send yo ' thievin ' black soul to Georgia ! " Fiercely he yanks at my ear , but the pain seems nothing , obliterated by terror so vast that the blood rushes down in red sheets before my eyes . I half swallow my tongue and I hear my voice , strangled , going aaaagh , aaaagh , aaaagh . On we press down the dark hallway , past ceiling-high windows streaming with rain , lit by lightning flashes ; I regard the heavens with twisted neck and eyes upside down . " I knowed you was de rascally little debbil dat stole it ! " Little Morning whispers . " I knowed it all de time ! " We burst into the great hall of the house , a part of the mansion I have never seen before . I glimpse a chandelier blazing with candles , walls paneled in glossy pine , a stairway winding dizzily upward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fleeting ; filled with horror , I realize that the lofty room is crowded with white people , almost the entire family  --  Marse Samuel and Miss Nell and two daughters , Miss Elizabeth , one of Marse Benjamin 's sons , and now Marse Benjamin himself , clad in a glistening wet rain cape as he plunges through the front door in a spray of water and a gust of cold wind . Lightning crackles outside and I hear his voice above the drumming of the rain . " Weather for the ducks ! " he shouts . " But , Lord , it smells like money ! The pond 's spilling over ! " There is a moment 's silence and the door slams shut , then I hear another voice : " What have we got , Little Morning ? " The old man lets go of my ear . " Dat book , " he says . " Dat book dat was stole ! Dis yere de robbah dat done it ! " Nearly swooning with fright , I clutch the book to my chest , unable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aaaagh from deep inside . I would weep , but my anguishis in a realm beyond tears . I yearn for the floor to openp153and swallow me . Never have I been this close to white people , and their nearness is so oppressive and fearful that I think I am going to vomit . ' Well , bless my boots , " I hear a voice say . " I just do n't believe it , " says another , a woman 's . " Whose little darky is that ? " asks still another voice . " Dis yere Nathaniel , " says Little Morning . His tone is still heavy with anger and indignation . " He belong to Lou-Ann in de kitchen . He de culprick . He de one dat snitch de volume . " He wrests the book from my grasp , regarding it with scholarlylifted eyebrows . " Dis de volume dat was took . Hit says so right here . De Life and de Death of Mr. Badman by John Bunyam . Hit de selfsame volume , Marse Sam , sho as my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ midst of my fright I am aware that Little Morning  --  the old humbug  --  has memorizedthe title by ear and is fooling no one with this display of literacy . " I knowed it war de same book when I cotched him readin ' it in de pantry . " " Reading ? " The voice is that of Marse Samuel , wondering , quite incredulous . I look up now , slowly . The white faces , viewed for the first time so closely  --  especially those of the females , only lightly touched by sun and weather  --  have the sheen and consistency of sour dough or the soft underbelliesof mushrooms ; their blue eyes glint boldly , startling as ice , and I regard each yawning pose , each freckle , with the awe of total discovery . " Reading ? " Marse Samuel says now , with amusement in his voice . " Come now , Little Morning ! " ' Well , natchel he war n't exackly readin ' , " the old man adds contemptuously . " He jes ' lookin ' at de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of de pitchers dat he took de book any-ways  --  " " But there are no pictures , are there , Nell ? It was your volume , after all  --  " Could it have been , as I sometimes thought years later , that at that moment I sensed a fatal juncture , realized withp154some child 's wise instinct that unless instantly I asserted my small nigger self I would be forever cast back into anonymity and oblivion ? And so could it have been that right then  --  desperate , lying , risking all  --  I mastered my terror and suddenlyturned on Little Morning , howling : " ' Tai n't so ! ' Tai n't so ! I can so read the book ! " ? Whatever the case , I remember a voice , Samuel Turner 's , his wonder and amazement fled , saying in sudden quiet , judicious , tolerant tones , silencing the family 's laughter : " No , no , just wait , maybe he can , let us see ! " And as the storm grumbles far off to the east @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eaves and a distant angry chattering of wet bluejays in the ailanthus trees , I find myself seated by the window . I have begun to cry , aware of white hovering faces like ghostly giant blobs above me , and whispering voices . I struggle briefly , pawing through the pages , but it is beyond all hope : I can not manage a single word . I feel that I am going to suffocate on the sobs mounting upward in my chest . My distress is so great that Marse Samuel 's words are miles beyond comprehension  --  a muffled echo I can only dredge up from memory years later  --  when I hear him cry out : " You see , Ben , it is true , as I 've told you ! They will try ! They will try ! And we shall teach him then ! Hurrah !

Suppose in the first place Ip155had lived out my life at Turner 's Mill . Suppose then I had been considerably less avid in my thirst for knowledge , so that it would not have occurred to me to steal that book . Or suppose , even more simply , that Samuel Turner  --  however decent and just an owner he might have remained anyway  --  had been less affected with that feverish and idealistic conviction that slaves were capable of intellectual enlightenment and enrichment of the spirit and had not , in his passion to prove this to himself and to all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiment . " ( No , I understand that I am not being quite fair , for surely when I recollect the man with all the honesty I can muster I know that we were joined by strong ties of emotion ; yet still the unhappy fact remains : despite warmth and friendship , despite a kind of love , I began as surely an experiment as a lesson in pig-breeding or the broadcasting of a new type of manure . ) Well , under these circumstances I would doubtless have become an ordinary run-of-the-mill house nigger , mildly efficientat some stupid task like wringing chickens ' necks or smoking hams or polishing silver , a malingerer wherever possibleyet withal too jealous of my security to risk real censure or trouble and thus cautious in my tiny thefts , circumspect in the secrecy of my afternoon naps , furtive in my anxious lecheries with the plump yellow-skinned cleaning maids upstairsin the dark attic , growing ever more servile and unctuous as I became older , always the crafty flatterer on the lookout for some bonus of flannel or stew beef or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and waistcoat developing , as I advanced into old age , a kind of purse-lipped dignity , known as Uncle Nat , well loved and adoring in return , a palsied stroker of the silken pates of little white grandchildren , rheumatic , illiterate , and filled with sleepiness , half yearning for that lonely death which at long last would lead me to rest in some tumbledown graveyard tangledwith chokeberry and jimson weed . It would not havep156been , to be sure , much of an existence , but how can I honestlysay that I might not have been happier ? For the Preacher was right : He that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow . And Samuel Turner ( whom I shall call Marse Samuel from now on , for that is how he was known to me ) could not have realized , in his innocence and decency , in his awesome goodness and softness of heart , what sorrow he was guilty of creating by feeding me that half-loaf of learning : far more bearable no loaf at all . Well , no matter now . Suffice it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so to speak , falling under the protective wing not only of Marse Samuel but of Miss Nell , who together with her older daughter Louisa had spent the quiet winter mornings of several years  --  " riding their hobby , " I rememberthey called it  --  drilling me in the alphabet and teachingme to add and subtract and , not the least fascinating , exposing me to the serpentine mysteries of the Episcopal catechism . How they drilled me ! How Miss Nell kept after me ! I never forgot these glossy-haired seraphs with their soft tutorial murmurs , and do not blame me too much when I say  --  I shall try not to allude to it again  --  that there was at least one moment during the earthquake twenty years later when I lingered on the memory of those sweet faces with a very special and savage intensity . " No , no , Nat , not sucklings and babes  --  babes and sucklings ! " " Yessum . Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength because of thine enemies , that thou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , that 's just right , Nat . Now then , verses three and four . Slowly , slow-ly ! And careful now ! " ' When I consider thy heavens , the work of thy fingers , the moon and the stars , which thou hast ordained . And  --  And  --  I forgets . "  | " Forget , Nat , not forgets . No darky talk ! Now  --  What is man " Yessum . What is man that thou art mindful of him ? and the son of man , that thou visiteth him ? Well , uh  --  And , For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels and hast crowned him with glory and honor ! " " Wonderful , Nat ! Oh , wonderful , wonderful ! Oh , Sam , there you are ! You should just hear Nat coming along ! Come here , Sam , sit beside us for a moment and listen , sit here by the fire ! Listen to our little darky recite out from the Bible ! He can speak it from memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , Nat , you smart little tar baby , you ? " " Yessum . " But suppose again that it had been Marse Samuel who had died , instead of Brother Benjamin . What then would have happened to that smart little tar baby ? Maybe you will be able to form your own judgment from some things I overheard on the veranda one sultry , airless summer evening after supper , when the two brothers were entertaining a pair of traveling Episcopal clergymen  --  " the Bishop 's visitants , " they called themselves  --  one of them named Dr. Ballard , a big-nosed , long-jawed bespectacled man of middle years garbed entirely in black from the tip of his wide-brimmed parson 's hat to his flowing cloak and gaiters buttoned up along his skinny shanks , blinking through square crystal glasses and emitting delicate coughs behind long white fingers as thin and pale as flower stalks ; the other minister dressed like him in funereal black but many years younger , in his twenties and bespectacled also , with a round , smooth , plump , prissy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him as Dr. Ballard 's daughter or maybe his wife . Not as yet advanced to the dining room , I labored in the kitchen as Little Morning 's vassal , and it was my duty at the moment to fetch water from the cistern and to keep thep158smudge pot going : positioned upwind in the sluggish air , it sent out small black-oily clouds of smoke , a screen against mosquitoes . Across the meadow , fireflies flickered in the dusk , and I recall from within the house the sound of a piano , the voice of Miss Elizabeth , Benjamin 's wife , breathless , sweet , in quavering , plaintive song : " Would you gain the tender creature , Softly , gently , kindly treat her ... " Though usually the sedulous snoop , I had paid no attention to the conversation , fascinated instead by Benjamin , wondering if this would be one of those evenings when he fell out of his chair . As Marse Samuel and the ministers chatted , I watched Benjamin stir in the chair , heard the wickerwork crackling beneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long , raising his brandy glass on high . While Little Morning came forward to serve him he sighed again and the sound was aimless , distracted , dwindling off into a little uhuh-uhlike the tail end of a yawn . I think I recall Dr. Ballard glancing at him uneasily , then turning back to Marse Samuel . And the uh-uh-uh sound again , not loud , still pitched betweenyawn and sigh , glass half filled with sirupy apple brandy extended negligently in midair , the other hand clutching the decanter . I watched his cheeks begin to flush , blooming tomato-pink in the twilight , and I said to myself : Yes , I think again tonight he might fall right on out of that chair . But even as I watched him I heard him suddenly exclaim : " Ha ! " Then he paused and said : " Ha ! Ha ! Jesus bloody Christ ! Come out and say it ! " And then I realized that despite his yawns and rude noises , he was listening to Dr. Ballard and so then I too turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  --  and so the Bishop is marking time , as he says . We are at the crossroads  --  that is the Bishop 's own expression  --  we are at the crossroads , marking time , awaiting somep159providential wind to guide us in the right direction . The Bishop is so gifted in his choice of expressions . At any rate , he is aware that the Church all too soon must make some decision . Meanwhile , as his visitants , we are able to send him reassuring news as to the condition of the slaves on at least one plantation . " He paused , with the bleak and wintry suggestion of a smile . " It will be so reassuring for the Bishop , " said the younger minister . " He will be interested , too , in knowing your general views . " " General views ? " Marse Samuel inquired . " General views on the institution itself , " Dr. Ballard explained . " He is greatly concerned to know the general views held by  --  how shall we say it ?  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment Marse Samuel was silent , his face drawn and reflective as he sucked at a long clay pipe . It was becoming dark . A mild gust of wind , feather-light upon my own brow , sent an oily curl of smoke across the veranda . In the distant swamp , frogs sang and throbbed in a wild , passionatemonotone . Little Morning approached Dr. Ballard with a silver tray balanced on the tips of black fingers . " Is you gwine have some mo ' port wine , mastah ? " I heard him ask . Still Marse Samuel remained silent , then finally he said in a slow and measured voice : " Doctor , I will be as direct with you as I can . I have long and do still steadfastly believe that slavery is the great cause of all the chief evils of our land . It is a cancer eating at our bowels , the source of all our misery , individual , political , and economic . It is the greatest curse a supposedly free and enlightened society has been saddled with in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , as you may have perceived , the most religious of men , yet I am not without faith and I pray nightly for the miracle , for the divine guidance which will somehow show us the way out ofp160this terrible condition . It is evil to keep these people in bondage , yet they can not be freed . They must be educated ! To free these people without education and with the prejudice that presently exists against them would be a ghastly crime . " Dr. Ballard did not immediately answer , but when he did his voice was detached and indistinct . " How interesting , " he murmured . " Fascinating , " said the other minister , sounding even more far away . Suddenly Benjamin lurched erect from his chair and walked to the far edge of the veranda . There in the shadows , unfastening himself , he commenced to piss into a rosebush . I could hear the noise of a lordly stream of water , urgent , uninterrupted , a plashing cascade upon leaf and thorn and vine , and now Benjamin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beloved brother ! Oh , my brother 's bleeding heart ! What a trial , what a tribulation to dwell with such a saint , who would try to alter the mechanism of history ! A saint he is , reverend visitants ! You are in the presence of a living , breathing saint ! Yas " Dr. Ballard blushed , murmuring something I could not understand . Watching from behind the smudge pot , I was suddenly tickled and I had to smother my amusement behind my hand . For the minister , in a desperate fidget , was obviouslyunaccustomed to conversing with anyone who was in the process of taking a piss , which Benjamin did without a flicker of a thought and in the most public way whenever he drank in the company of men . Yet now Dr. Ballard , though agitated , had to pay even more deference to Benjamin than he did to Marse Samuel , for distant and apart as Benjamin may have been this evening he was still the older brother and the plantation 's titled owner . I watched joyfully as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild discomfort at Benjamin 's back . Suddenly thep161torrent ceased and Benjamin wheeled about , languidly lacing up his fly . Weaving a little , he crossed the porch , drawing near Marse Samuel and letting his hand fall upon the back of his brother 's neck ; as he did so , Marse Samuel glanced up at him with a sour-sweet look , rueful , glum , yet touched with quiet affection . Although they were so dissimilar as to seem born of different families , even the most unobservant house servant was aware of the strong bond between them . They had quarreled many times in the past in their fraternal and peaceable way , seeming oblivious of all eavesdropping ( or more likely they did not care ) and many a black servant gliding around the dinner table had divined enough of their talk to know where each brother stood , philosophically , at least about his body if not his soul . " My brother is as sentimental as an old she-hound , Doctor , " Benjamin said in an amiable voice . " He believes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can take a bunch of darkies and turn them into shopowners and sea captains and opera impresarios and army generals and Christ knows what all . I say differently . I do not believe in beating a darky . I do not believe , either , in beating a dog or a horse . If you wish my belief to take back to the Bishop , you can tell him that my belief is that a darky is an animal with the brain of a human child and his only value is the work you can get out of him by intimidation , cajolery , and threat . " " I see , " Dr. Ballard murmured , " yes , I see what you mean . " The minister was paying Benjamin close attention , with a squint-eyed look yet still very deferential . " Yes , I do see clearly what you mean . " " Like my sentimental and most gentle-hearted brother , " Benjamin continued , " I am against the institution of slavery too . I wish to Jesus it had never come to these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could invent to plant corn or cut timber , another to pull suckers , another fine machinep162to set out in the field and chop tobacco , still another big grand machine to come chugging through the house , lighting the lamps and setting the rooms in order  --  " There was an attentive burst of laughter from the two ministers , the younger one tittering behind his fingers while Dr. Ballard made small chuckles and Benjamin himself continued , appreciatively grinning , with one hand resting friendly and familiar on his brother 's shoulder . Still the soursweetexpression lingered on Marse Samuel 's face and the faintest outline of a sheepish little smile . " Or a machine , I fancy , " Benjamin went on , " that when the mistress of the household prepared herself for an afternoon 's outing , would harness up the mare and bring Old Dolly and the gig around to the front entrance , and then with its strange mechanism set the lady down on one seat and itself on another and prod Old Dolly into a happy canter through the woods and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , invent a machine like that , furthermore , that wo n't eat you out of house and home , that wo n't lie and cheat and thieve you blind , that is efficient instead of being a paragon of blockheadedness and sheer stupidity , that you can lock away at dark in its shed like a pumping engine or a spinning jenny without fear that this machine is going to get up in the dead of night and make off with a prize goose or your fattest Guinea shoat and that when this machine is worn out and beyond its usefulness , you can discard it and buy another instead of being cursed with a noaccountold body that conscience dictates you 've still got to supply with shoes and molasses and a peck of corn a week until the age of ninety-five  --  Hey ! Invent a machine like any of these , gentlemen , and I will say a happy adieu to slavery the moment I can lay my hands on the likes of such a mechanism ! " He paused for a moment , taking a swallow from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , I do not see in the near future the possibility of such a machine eventuating . " There was a brief spell of silence among the company . Dr.p163Ballard continued to chuckle faintly . Miss Elizabeth had ceased singing , and now in the deep shadows of evening I could hear only the whine of mosquitoes at bay beyond the cloud of dark smoke , and nearby the soft insistent cooing of a mourning dove , a dull fretful sigh  --  weehoo-hoo-hoo  --  like a sleepy child in pain . Dr. Ballard crossed his legs abruptly , then said : " Well , from the general tenor of your remarks , Mr. Turner , I presume  --  well , how shall I say it ?  --  I presume that you feel that the institution of slavery is  --  well , something we must accept . Would that be a proper interpretation of your remarks ? " When Benjamin failed to reply immediately , still gazing down with a crooked bemused smile at Marse Samuel , the minister went on : " And would it also be accurate to discern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Negro lags so far behind the rest of us  --  I mean , the white race  --  in moral development that , well , for his own welfare it might be best that he  --  well , be kept in a kind of benevolent subjection ? I mean , is it not possible that slavery is perhaps  --  how shall we say ?  --  the most satisfactory form of existence for such a people ? " He paused , then said : " Cursed be Canaan . A servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren . Genesis , ninth chapter , twenty-fifth verse . Certainlythe Bishop is not completely disinclined to take this viewpoint . I myself  --  " But he hesitated , falling silent then , and the whole veranda was quiet , disturbed only by the creaking of chairs . As if his mind for a moment had wandered far away , Benjaminstood there and made no reply , gazing gently down at Marse Samuel , who sat very still in the gathering dark , calmly chewing on his pipe but with a woebegone expression , strained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thought better of it , said nothing . Then Benjamin looked up and said : " You take a little slave like that one there  --  " And it was an instant before I realized he was speaking of me . He made a gesture toward mep164with his hand , turning about , and as he did so the others turned too and suddenly I could feel their eyes upon me in the fading light . Nigger , Negro , darky , yes  --  but I had never heard myself called a slave before . I remember moving uneasilybeneath their silent , contemplative gaze and I felt awkward and naked , stripped down to bare black flesh , and a wicked chill like cold water filled the hollow of my gut as the thought crashed in upon me : Yes , I am a slave . " You take a little slave like that one there , " Benjamin went on , " my brother here thinks he can take a little slave like that and educate him , teach him writing and arithmetic and drawing and so on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Bible study , and in general raise him up with all the amenities of learning . Gentlemen , I ask you , in all seriousness , ai n't that a whangdoodle of a notion ? " " Yaanh-s , " said Dr. Ballard . The " yes " was a thin whickeringsound high in the nose , vaguely distant and amused , yaanh-s . " Although , gentlemen , I do not doubt that given my brother 's belief in colonization and emancipation and his faith in education and God knows what all , given his passion to prove that a darky has the native gifts granted to the averagecollege professor , he could take a little slave like that one there and teach him the alphabet and his sums and the outlines of geography and right before your eyes you 'd think his case was proved . But , gentlemen , let me tell you , my brother does not know darkies like I do . Either that or his saintly belief in reform prevents him from seeing the truth . For , gentlemen , I know better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you that if you show me a little darky whom you 've taught to read the complete works of Julius Caesar forward and backward in the original Latin tongue , I will show you a darky who is still an animal with the brain of a human child that will never get wise nor learn honesty nor acquire any human ethics though that darky live to a ripe old age . Ap165darky , gentlemen , is basically as unteachable as a chicken , and that is the simple fact of the matter . " He halted , then slowly yawned : " Ah , time for bed ! " The ministers and Marse Samuel rose , murmurously chatting , but now as night fell and the bright globe of a full moon ' rose radiant above the distant woods , I felt Little Morning squeeze me hard on the flesh of my arm , a signal , and I ceased listening to anyone talk , turning to help the old man carry bottles and glasses from the veranda , dousing the smudge pot with sprinkled water , busying myself with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chill in my bones would not leave nor was I able for a long time to banish from my mind the thought which hung there as if written on a banner : I am a slave . After some minutes , returning from the pantry , I saw that Benjamin had disappeared , and then I ipied Marse Samuel lingering alone at the edge of the veranda . He leaned with one hand propped against the railingand his eyes seemed to follow the two ministers as they made their slow way , black against a blacker black , into the shadows of the night . " God watch over your dreams , Mr. Turner ! " the younger one called in a tone girlish and clear . " And your dreams too , " Marse Samuel replied , but his voice was the thinnest murmur and they could not have heard it . Then he was gone from the veranda and I stood suddenly afraid , listening to Little Morning all agrumble , in gloomy discussion with himself as he limped stiffly among the chairs . A fragrance of tobacco smoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment the two ministers , groping their way across the lawn toward the wing of the house , were illumined in a shaft of moonlight , then they vanished for good among the shadows , while the moon itself , rising behind a black frieze of sycamore trees thick with summer leaves , was suddenly obscured , pitching house and lawn into smotheringdarkness . Well , I am a slave , I thought , and I shivered in the windless , sultry night which seemed  --  just for an in/stant  --  to surround me cold and treacherous and , more somberly , beyond the hope of ending , as if its long ticking course through the hours might lead only to a deeper darkness , without waking , without green glimmerings of dawn or the sound of cockcrow . Only a few months after this Benjamin died , way out in the swamp , crushed beneath a gigantic bald cypress just as he was engaged in brandy-befuddled remonstrance with two black timber hands . The Negroes later claimed that they had tried to warn of the great tree toppling at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been ignored , and they themselves had skipped lightly away as the monster crashed down upon poor drunken Benjamin . Certainly from the rate at which Benjamin had begun to stow away liquor , the story seemed true enough . Among the Negroes for years after there were dark hints , barely spoken , of foul play  --  but for myself I doubted it . Slaves have put up with far meaner owners than Benjamin . Anyway , whatever final constraints Marse Samuel may have felt about continuing my education were removed by his brother 's passing . Beyond doubt Benjamin would never have been a cruel master , a nigger-breaker . But if Benjamin 's death brought no rejoicing among the Negroes , it would not be accurate either to say that any were plunged into mourning . Even the dumbest slave shelling corn down in the most rundown and ramshackle cabin had gotten wind of at least the general drift of Marse Samuel 's charitable notions , and they all knew they had passed into more promising hands ; so on the day of Benjamin 's funeral , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks behind the big house and the more musically inclined lifted their voices in tender lament " 0 my massah 's gone ! massah 's gone ! My massah 's gone to heaven , my Lord ! I ca n't stay behind ! "  |  --  the insincerity of their simple words was as plain as the difference between gold and brass .. . And so during all those boyhood years when the horn blew at the first crack of dawn , when Abraham stood at the edge of the stable in the still-starlit dark trumpeting in sad hoarse notes the awakening call which brought firelight flickeringat the doors of the cabins down the slope  --  that horn did not blow for me . I alone could stir and turn and sleep another hour , until the full light of sunup roused me to my kitchen chores long after the other Negroes had vanished to mill and woods and fields . Not for my soft pink palms  --  accustomed to the touch of silver and crystal , of pewter and glossy oiled oak  --  was the grimy feel of the hoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me was the summer heat of the blacksmith shop or the steaming , gnat-mad fields of corn or the bone-cracking labor of the woods , rump deep in decaying slime , or the racket and toil of the mill where the weight of grain and timber ruptured the gut and twisted shoulders and spine into a stooped attitude of toil as immutable as statues carved in black marble . And although Marse Samuel  --  certainlya bountiful master by any standard  --  could never be accused of starving his Negroes , it was nonetheless not the field-hand diet of hog and hominy to which my palate becameaccustomed , but finer fare , lean ham and game and pastry  --  leftovers to be sure , but I rarely knew what it was like not to partake of the same food that the Turners themselvesenjoyed . As for work itself , it would be a stretch of the truth to say that my days were idle ; indeed , the memory of my youth at Turner 's Mill is one of a constant hustling about the house from dawn until dusk . But honestly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweat and stink of the field . I cleaned , I washed , I scrubbed ; I polished doorknobs and built fires and learned to set a meticulous table . The hand-me-down clothes I received were baggy , but they did n't scratch . Off and on for another year or two I continued with my lessons1p168under the tutelage of Miss Nell , a patient , wispy creature who because of some private inner crisis had intensified her already fervid religious bent , now abandoning not only WalterScott but even John Bunyan and all such secular work in favor of the Bible , especially the Prophets and the Psalms and the Book of Job , which we continued to read together beneath a great tulip poplar , my young black woolly head brushing her silken bonnet . Do not consider me impertinent when I say that years later , immersed in the project which is the reason for this account , I breathed a silent word of gratitude to this gentle and motherly lady , from whose lips I first heard those great lines from Isaiah : Therefore will I number you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the slaughter , because when I called ye did not answer .. . It seems to me now , as a matter of fact , that it was Miss Nell who inadvertently conveyed to me the knowledge of my own very special standing within the family , during a spell of illness a year or so before my mother died and which I reckon to have been in the autumn when I had just turned fourteen . I did not know then nor was I ever told the name of my affliction , but it could not have been anything but grave , for I passed dark streams of blood from my bladder and for days and nights I was racked by an aching fever which sent my mind off into crazed visions and nightmares through which daylight and dark , waking and sleeping were hopelessly jumbledtogether and my surroundings became as unreal to me as if I had been transported into another land . Dimly I recall being moved from the corn-shuck bed I had shared for so long with my mother to some other room in the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheets amid the hushed sound of whispers and tiptoeing footsteps . There in my delirium I was attended to every moment ; my head was gently lifted , I drank water from a tumbler held to my lips by soft white hands . These same pale hands reappeared constantly , hovering over my eyes as in a dream to cool my burning brow with strips of flannel dipped in cool water.  |p169After  a week I slowly began to recover , and the week followingthis I returned to my mother 's room , quite infirm at first but after a while ready to resume my daily chores . Yet I was never able to forget how in the midst of my sickness  --  during a single moment of clarity which came over me before I fell back into a fevered nightmare  --  I heard Miss Nell 's tearful voice , her whispered words beyond the strange door of the strange room : " Oh Lord , Sam , our little Nat ! Poor little Nat ! We must pray , Sam , pray , pray ! He must n't be allowed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the darling , the little black jewel of Turner 's Mill . Pampered , fondled , nudged , pinched , I was the household 's spoiled child , a grinning elf in a starched jumper who gazed at himself in mirrors , witlessly preoccupied with his own ability to charm . That a white child would not have been so sweetly indulged  --  that my very blackness was central to the privileges I was given and the familiarity I was allowed  --  never occurred to me , and doubtless I would not have understood even if I had been told . Small wonder then that from the snug , secure dominion of my ignorance and self-satisfaction I began more and more to regard the Negroes of the mill and field as creatures beneath contempt , so devoid of the attributes I had come to connect with the sheltered and respectable life that they were worth not even my derision . Let some wretched cornfield hand , sweating and stinking , his bare foot gashed by a mishandled hoe , make the blunder of appearing at the edge of the veranda , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please fetch him some kind of " portice " for his wound , and I would direct him to the proper rear door in a voice edged with icy scorn . Orshould any black children from the cabins invade , no matter ( how guilelessly , the precincts of the big house and its rolling 4 lawn , I would be at them with a flourished broomstick and shrill cries of abuse  --  safe however behind the kitchen door . Such was the vainglory of a black boy who may have been alone among his race in bondage who had actually readp170pages from Sir Walter Scott and who knew the product of nine multiplied by nine , the name of the President of the United States , the existence of the continent of Asia , the capitalof the state of New Jersey , and could spell words like Deuteronomy , Revelation , Nehemiah , Chesapeake , Southampton , and Shenandoah . It must have been during the spring of my sixteenth year that Marse Samuel took me aside on the lawn after one middaydinner and announced a rather surprising change in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had of belonging and of a closeness to the family , I was not of course really of the family and there were intimacies I was denied ; days and weeks might go by without Marse Samuel paying any note of me , especially during the long busy seasons of planting and harvest , and thus those special moments when I was the objectof his attention I can recall with the greatest clearness and intensity . On this particular afternoon he spoke of my work in the house , commending me on my alertness and industryand on the good reports brought to him by Miss Nell and the young mistresses regarding the nimble way I applied myself not only to my lessons but to my daily chores . Now , all this was laudable , he said , and the duteous way I attended to my work was something in which I myself should take pride . The fact remained , however , that I owned too much ability and intelligence to labor for long as a house servant  --  a career which could not help but stunt and diminishthe capacities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a barren dead end . Did I not honestly think that such a way of life was suitable only for rickety old codgers like Little Morning or ancient mammies with bandannas and rheumy eyes and with a bulge of snuff in their wrinkled cheeks ? Certainly a boy who had learned as much as I had could not contemplate such a fruitless lifetime with anything but despondency and dread . For a moment I was unable to answer . I do not believep171that I had ever thought of the future ; it is not in the mood of a Negro , once aware of the irrecoverable fact of his bondage , to dwell on the future at all , and even I in my state of relative good fortune must have simply assumed without thought that the days and years which stretched out before me would present only the familiar repetitious and interminable clutter of dirty dishes , chimney ashes , muddy boots , tarnished doorknobs , chamber pots , mops and brooms . That something different might befall my lot had never occurred to me . I do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me gently on the shoulder , exlaiming in an eager , hearty voice : " I have grander plans for this young darky . " Grand plans indeed . The beginning of an apprenticeship in carpentry , which , as it turned out for long years , was of as little use to me or anyone as so much rotting sawdust clogging a millwheel . But I could not have known that then . I flung myself into this new fresh field of learning with all the delight and anticipation and hungry high spirits of a white boy setting off for the College of William &; Mary and an education in the mysteries of law . Marse Samuel had , for one thing , just recently acquired the services of a master carpenter , a German from Washington called Goat ( it occurred to me long afterward that this could not have been the proper spelling , that it must have been something like Godt , but no one ever told me otherwise and in my recollection the man remains forever Goat ) , and it was these hands into which my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the guidance of Goat I learned the carpenter 's trade in the dusty shop down the slope between the big house and the cabins . I had become fairly good-sized for my age , and was strongly muscled and capable with my hands ; all this combined with the fact that I had more than the rudiments of an education , and could measure and calculate nearly as well as any grown white man , made me an able student of the craft and I quickly learned to handle the saw and the adzep172and the plane and could set a row of joists parallel and straight beneath the laths of a new corncrib roof almost as skillfully as Goat himself . Goat was a large beefy man slow of movement and of words . Outside of carpentering , he seemed content to live by himself and to raise chickens . He had a crown of wispy hair and a shaggy beard the color of cinnamonand he supplied emphasis to his slow , cluttered , growling speech with choppy motions of knobbed and beefy hands . We were able to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me carpentry well and I always felt grateful to him . One thing about the carpenter 's shop has always lingered in my mind and I should tell it , even though it concerns a matter I would hesitate to dwell on had I not resolved to make this account as truthful as possible . Like most boys of sixteen or thereabouts I had begun to feel severely the pressures of my new manhood , yet I was in an unusual positioncompared to the other Negro boys , who found an easy outlet for their hunger with the available and willing little black girls whom they took during some quick stolen instant at the edge of a cornfield or amid the cool concealing grass of a stand of sorghum down at the edge of the woods . Isolated as I was from the cabins and such activity , I grew up in almost total ignorance of these fleshly pleasures , and whateverfurther knowledge I might have gained was confounded by the fear ( and this was a fear I must confess I was unable to shake totally free of even in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and obnoxious in the sight of the Lord . Nonetheless , I was a vigorous and healthy boy , and try as I might to fight down temptation I could not resist acceptingthe opportunity to excite myself whenever the force of my desire became overwhelming . For some reason at that time it seemed plausible to believe that the Lord would not chastise me too harshly so long as I was moderate in taking my pleasure , and thus I limited these solitary moments top173once a week  --  usually Saturdays , close enough to the Sabbath so as to make my penitent prayers on that day all the more forceful and devout . I would go to a small , low-ceilinged storage shed that was connected to the carpenter 's shop by a door which I could lock with a peg and thong . It was always a nameless white girl between whose legs I envisioned myself  --  a young girl with golden curls . The shed smelled strongly of freshly hewn timber and there was a resinous odor of loblolly pine , pungentand sharp enough to sear the nostrils ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past a stand of pine trees , that same spicy and redolent odor of cut timber would arouse my senses and I would feel a sudden surge and stiffeningat my groin as I thought of the carpenter 's shop and as the memory began achingly to return , mingling tenderness and desire , of my vision of the golden-haired girl with her lips half open and whispering , and my young self so many years before crouched panting in the pine-smelling sweetness . I suspect that it was a kind of loneliness , together with the fact that I had an amount of leisure not granted to many other slaves , which helped cause me at this time so zealously to precipitate myself into a study of the Bible , where I acquired  --  even at that early age  --  such a reverence and a sense of majesty in the presence of the Psalms and in the teachings of the great Prophets that I resolved that no matter where my destiny took me , no matter what humdrum tasks befell my lot in later years , I would become first and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one year Miss Nell made me a gift of a Bible  --  one of several left at Turner 's Mill by an itinerant messenger of the Bible Society in Richmond . " Heed this good book , Nathaniel , " she said in her soft and distant voice , " and happiness shall attend you wherever you go . " I will never forget my excitement as she pressed the brown leather-covered Bible into my hands . Surely at thatp174moment I must have been ( though all unaware ) the only black boy in Virginia who possessed a book . My joy was so great that I became dizzy , and I began to tremble and sweat , though windy drafts swept through the house and the day was bitterly cold . I was overtaken by such a bewildering emotion that I could not even thank the good lady , but merely turned and went to my little room , where I sat on the corn-shuck tick in the slanting icicle light of Christmas afternoon , quite unable to lift the cover and look at the pages . I recall the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall behind me , and the kitchen warmth stealing through the cracks of the timbers at my back . I recall too the echo of the spinet piano dimly tinkling far off in the great hall of the house and the sound of white people 's voices lifted in song  --  Joy to the world ! the Lord is come  --  while with the Bible still clutched unopened in my hands I gazed through a warped and crinkled isinglass windowpane to the sere wind-swept slope outside : there a mob of Negroes from the cabins was trooping toward the house . Muffled up against the cold in the coarse and shapeless yet decent winter garmentsMarse Samuel provided for them , they straggled along in a single line , men , women , pickaninnies , prepared to receivetheir gifts  --  a beanbag or a hunk of rock candy for the children , a yard of calico for the women , a plug of tobacco or a cheap jackknife for the men . They were a disheveled , ragged lot , and as they clumped past on the frozen ground near the window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Christmas anticipation , laughter high and heedless , and loutish nigger cheer . The sight of them suddenly touched me with a loathing so intense that it was akin to disgust , bellysickness , and I turned my eyes away , throwing open the Bible at last to a passage whose meaning was lost on me then entirelybut which I never forgot and now in the light of all that has since come to pass shimmers in my memory like a transfiguration : I will ransom them from the power of the grave ; Ip175will redeem them from death : 0 death , I will be thy plagues ; 0 grave , I will be thy destruction .. . Except for Marse Samuel and Miss Nell ( and that single fleeting recollection of Brother Benjamin ) , there is little enough I seem to be able to remember about the Turner family . Miss Elizabeth  --  Benjamin 's widow  --  remains but a shadow in my mind ; a bony , weepy-looking , raw-elbowed woman , she sang hopefully in a quavering voice and whenever I try to conjure her up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disembodied , pining , frail as a reed , a fluty desiccated Anglo-Saxon whine . She was tuberculous , and since her ailment required her to be often on the coast near Norfolk , where it was thought by the doctors that the damp salt air was curative , I saw her infrequently and then only from afar . Benjamin 's two sons had both studied something called Progressive Agronomy at the College of William &; Mary , and soon after his father 's death the older son , Willoughby , removedhimself and his bride to a smaller dwelling at the lower , thickly wooded edge of the plantation ; from this house , called the New Retreat , he supervised as his father had before him the logging and timber-cutting operations of the Turner enterprise , and so him too I rarely encountered or had any dealings with . The other agronomist , Lewis , who was a bachelor  --  ruddyfacedand stocky and about thirty  --  shared with his uncle in the management of the plantation and in effect had become the general overseer upon the abrupt departure of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lecherous ways . ( I have no idea whether Marse Samuel ever learned of the Irishman 's encounter with my mother although I 'm fairly certain that the man , perhaps daunted by her basic unwillingness , never dared to approach her again . Whatever , it is testimony I believe to Marse Samuel 's toler/ance and patience  --  and is perhaps too a measure of somethingtouchingly ingenuous in his nature  --  that he not only put up with McBride 's drunkenness long beyond the point when another gentleman planter would have sent him packing , but became aware of his proclivity to Negro women a full two years after everyone else on the place had noted the marvel of at least three little slaves born with a palish cast , light curly hair , and a long fat Irish lip . ) Lewis was an easygoingmaster ( though I do not believe overly bright ; he made errors in his speech which I in my young black wisdom secretlysneered at ) , and he tended to follow his uncle 's guidancein most practical matters including the handling of Negroes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was more or less fair and good-humored , which is all that any slave could ask . When he was not at work he seemed to be most of the time out in the woods on horseback or shooting birds in the meadows , and thus stayed pretty much apart from the Negroes and such private affairs as they might be said ( with a stretch of the imagination ) to have . Of the Turners , then , there remains only to speak of Marse Samuel 's two daughters , Miss Louisa and Miss Emmeline . The older girl , Miss Louisa , aided her mother in my earliest instruction , as I have already recounted ; and the swift , assured way in which I learned to read and spell and do my sums gives me reason to believe that she was an excellentteacher . But our relationship in the end was so shortlivedthat it is hard for me to summon up an image of her . When I was around fourteen she got married to a young land speculator from Kentucky and moved away with him forever , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her Scripture-beset mother . Miss Emmeline was the last , the youngest . At the time I am speaking of she was twenty-five , perhaps a little more , and I worshiped her  --  from a great distance , of course  --  with the chaste , evangelical passion that could only be nurtured inp177the innocent heart of a boy like myself , reared in surroundingswhere women ( at least white ladies ) seemed to float like bubbles in an immaculate effulgence of purity and perfection . With her lustrous rich auburn hair parted at the center and her dark intelligent eyes and the sweet gravity of her mouth which lent to her face such an air of noble calm , she would have been a great beauty even in a society far removed from this backwater , where work and isolation and the weather tended quickly to harshen a white mistress 's charms . Perhaps city life had had something to do with this , since after attending the female seminary nearby in Lawrenceville she had gone north to Baltimore , and there she had spent severalyears in the home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fallen victim ( or so it was rumored  --  and so it was bruited about the kitchen by Prissy or Little Morning or one of the house servants , all of them by training chronic snoops ) of an unhappy love affair  --  so grievous that it had threatened a physical decline  --  and thus Marse Samuel had summoned her home , where she now helped Miss Nell in the management of the household . Eventually it seemed that her spirits were restored , and she fell without strain into the routine of a young plantation mistress , attending to the ill and the feeblein the cabins , laying up preserves and making fruit cakes , and in the spring and summer taking care of the cultivation of a large vegetable garden not far from the carpenter 's shop . The vegetable garden was her particular devotion ; she planted by herself all the seeds and seedlings , and for hours on end , her head sheltered by an enormous straw hat , she would labor side by side with the two small Negro girls who were her assistants , plucking weeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's shop , I would often raise my eyes and watch her secretly , bewitched , suddenly short of breath , yearning with a kind of raw hunger for that moment which I knew was about to arrive , and did  --  that moment when , pausing to look upward at the sky , she let her fair andp178slender fingers pass lightly over her damp brow , all the while remaining motionless upon her knees , the eyes gently reflective , her teeth glinting through lightly parted lips , a vein throbbing at her temple while she offered me quite unawares the rare glimpse , face to face , of her pure , proud , astonishing smooth-skinned beauty . Yet my passion for her was virginal , miserably and obscurelyconnected with my own religious strivings . I believed in purity and goodness , and there was something about her total beauty  --  a sadness , but a restless and lonely independence of manner , a proud serenity about the way in which she moved  --  which was pure and good in itself , like the disembodied , transparent beauty of an imagined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned that such an infatuation for a beautiful white mistress on the part of a black boy was not at all uncommon , despite the possibility of danger , but at the time my adoration of her seemed to me eerie , unique , and almost insupportable , as if I had been afflicted at the roots of my soul by some divine sickness . I do not believe that during this year-long period of my worship she spoke ten words to me and I dared say nothing to her except to breathe once or twice a queasy " Yessum " or " No 'm " to some casual question . Since I no longer worked in the house our paths crossed seldom , and I only asked the Lord that I be allowed sight of her once or twice a day . Naturally she had been aware for a number of years of my unusual standing as a privileged young servant , but her mind was on anything but a nigger boy and although her manner toward me was not unkindly she seemed only faintly conscious of the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called me to help her hang a flower pot ; in my jangled fumbling and confusion I nearly allowed the pot to fall , and when , standing at my side , she caught my bare arm amid a shower of earth and cried in a sharp voice , " Nat ! Silly goose ! " the sound of my name onp179her lips was as cooling as a benediction and the contact with her white fingers was like the touch of fire . Then one night in late summer about a year after Miss Emmeline 's return to the plantation from Baltimore , there was a party at Turner 's Mill  --  and this in itself was an event worthy of note . Social affairs at the plantation were rare ( at least within the memory of my time at the big house ) , not only because of the remoteness of the place but because of the perilous conditions of transportation  --  deep fords , fallen trees , and washed-out roads making intercourse between the various Tidewater estates in each case a major venture , not to be considered lightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a great while , however  --  every two years or so , usually in the late summer when the crops were laid by  --  Marse Samuel would decide to have what he called , humorously , an " assemblage , " and a score of people would come from miles around , planters and their families from the James and Chickahominy rivers and from down in North Carolina , people with names like Carter and Harrison and Byrd and Clark and Bonner arriving in elegant coaches and accompanied by a hustling , noisy entourage of black nursemaidsand body servants . They would stay for four or five days , sometimes as long as a week , and daily there would be fox hunts with the hounds of Major Vaughan , whose plantationwas not far away , and turkey shoots and contests in horsemanship , pistol matches and picnics and a great deal of contented , somnolent , easy palaver among the ladies on the veranda , and at least two fancy balls in the great hall , bedecked for each evening 's merriment in yards of pink and blue bunting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had reached the age of sixteen or thereabouts ) to act in the capacity of " chief usher , " a title which Marse Samuel bestowedupon me and which involved my supervision of all thep180Negro help outside of the kitchen . ( It is possibly a measure of Marse Samuel 's confidence in me that he entrusted me with this position , as young as I happened to be ; doubtless on the other hand I simply was quicker and smarter than all the rest . ) Caparisoned for a week in purple velvet knee-length pantaloons , a red silk jacket with buckles of shiny brass , and a white goat's-hair wig which culminated behind in a saucy queue , I must have presented an exotic sight to the Carters and the Byrds , but I reveled in my role and took great pleasure in bustling about and lording it over the other black boys  --  most of them enlisted from the fields , dumb callow kids all thumbs and knobby knees and popping eyes  --  even though each day I was kept feverishly busy from dawn to dusk . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ladies dismount , I too who rode herd on Lucas and Todd and Pete and Tim , making certain that they polished each night each gentleman 's boots , that they cleaned up the litter on the lawn , that they hurried about ceaselessly , fetching ice from the ice cellar , retrieving a lady 's lost fan , tethering horses , untethering them , doing this , undoing that . I was the first to arise long before dawn ( to help Little Morning prepare daily a stirrup cup of whiskey for the fox hunt was one of my most important chores ) and nearly always the last to retire , and the fact that I was up and about at a truly unearthly hour was the only reason that caused me one morning , between ball and hunt , to nearly stumble over Miss Emmeline and someone else in the moonless and murky dark . It was not the loud whisper of her voice that shocked me so much  --  though I instantly distinguished it  --  but the Lord 's name in her mouth , uttered in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard blasphemy on a woman 's tongue . And so astonished was I by the words that as I stood there rooted in the dark it did not just then occur to me to consider the event which occasioned them , and I thought she was in some great and nameless peril : " Oh mercy . . . oh God . . . oh Jesus .. .  |p181wait  ! . . . oh Jesus ... now wait ! ... quick ... put it back .. . now then . . . slowly . . . oh Jesus Christ . . . slowly ! .. . wait ! " A man 's soft groan from the lawn behind the hedge now made me aware of the other presence , and I remained half paralyzed , fascinated yet suddenly sick nearly unto death at the sound of the Saviour 's name spoken thus , as if He had been stripped shamelessly naked by the hot urgency of her lips . " Wait , wait ! " she again implored , and a gentle sigh came from the man 's throat , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mercy . . . mercy . . . wait now , slowly ! . . . oh Jesus . . . oh Christ . . . oh Christ . . . oh yes , now ! . . . Oh mercy . . . mercy . . . mercy ... " Abruptly then , in a prolonged and dwindling little sob , the voice died and all was silent , and I could hear nothing but the piping of frogs in the millpond and a dull thumping of horses against the stable stalls and the sound of my own heart racing madly , so loud that I thought surely it must be heard above the soughing of a night wind in the sycamore trees . I stood there unable to move , my spirit a shambles from chagrin and shock and fear . And I recall thinking wretchedly : This is what comes of being a nigger . It ai n't fair . If I was n't a nigger I would n't find out about things I do n't want to find out about . It ai n't fair . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , impassioned , tremulous : " Oh my love Em , my love , my love , Em my love ! " But there was no reply from Miss Emmeline and time crept by slowly and painfully like something crippled and old , causing my mouth to go dry and a numbness , premonitorywith the clammy touch of death , to spread a tingling chill through my legs and thighs . At last I heard her voice again , placid now , composed , but edged with contempt and bitterness . " Finally you 've accomplished what you 've been after for ages . I hope you 're satisfied . "  | " Oh Em , my love , my love , " he whispered . " Let me  --  " " Stay away from me ! " she said , her voice rising now in the darkness . " Stay away from me , do you hear ! If you touch me , if you say another word to me I 'll tell Papa ! I 'll tell Papa and he 'll shoot you for ravishing your own cousin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protested . " You consented to  --  Oh Em , my love , my dear  --  " " Just stay away from me ! " she repeated , and again she fell silent and there was no sound for a long while until suddenly I heard her burst out in words touched with raw and abandoneddespair : " Oh God , how I hate you . Oh God , how I hate this place . Oh God , how I hate life . Oh God , how I hate God ! " " Oh do n't , Em ! " he whispered in a frantic voice . " My love , my love , my love ! " " This God damned horrible place . I would even go back to Maryland and become a whore again , and allow the only man I ever loved to sell my body on the streets of Baltimore . Get your God damned hands off me and do n't speak another word to me again ! If you do I 'll tell Papa ! Now leave me , leave me , leave me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this narrative , and more than once , of a Negro 's ubiquity and the learning he acquires , so often unbeknownst to white people , of the innermost secrets of their hearts . That evening was one such time , but it seemed to me , too , as I watched Miss Emmeline rise from the grass and in a rustle of taffeta disappear into the blue shadowsof the house and then saw her cousin Lewis rise also and slouch off miserably through the night , that no matter how much covert knowledge a Negro possessed there were questionsalways left unanswered and a mystery , and that thereforehe should not feel himself too wise or all-knowing . Certainlythis was true in regard to Miss Emmeline , who , all the while I pondered her after that evening , became ever more wrapped in a dark and secret cloak . She did not speak an/.3other word to Lewis nor , so far as I was able to observe , did he dare speak to her ; her threat , her admonition triumphed , and some months later the poor man left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to set himself up in sugar or cotton . As for what I heard and saw that night , please do not consider my account simply  --  well , mischievous  --  for in truth such an episode had the effect of altering my entire vision of white women . For now the glow of saintliness which had surrounded Miss Emmeline in my mind dimmed , flickered out , disappeared ; it was as if she suddenly stood disrobed and the fascination she held for me was of a different order , just as my hopeless and unending frustration was of a different kind though no less severe . For a while I was still maddened by her . I still worshiped her beauty from a distance but I could not help but be shaken to my guts by the words of blasphemy I had heard her utter , which now inflamed my thoughts , and like pinpoints of fire , pricked and agitated my very dreams . In my fantasies she began to replace the innocent , imaginary girl with the golden curls as the object of my craving , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place in the carpenter 's shop to release my pent-up desires , it was Miss Emmeline whose bare white full round hips and belly responded wildly to all my lust and who , sobbing " mercy , mercy , mercy " against my ear , allowed me to partake of the wicked and godless yet unutterable joys of defilement . One day in October just after I became eighteen  --  a day recollected with that mysterious clarity of all days upon which transpire the greatest of events  --  I discovered the actual outlines of that future which Marse Samuel had envisionedfor me all these weeks and months and years . It was a Saturday , one of those dusty , ocherous autumnal days whose vivid weather never again seems so sweet and inviting after that youthful time of discovery : wood smokep184and maple leaves blazing in the trees , an odor of apples everywherelike a winy haze , squirrels scampering for chinquapinsat the edge of the woods , a constant stridor of crickets among the withering grass , and over all a ripe sunny heat edged with feathery gusts of wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had as usual risen early and gone to the shop , where I busied myself in loading some short twoby-fourson a barrow . Marse Samuel had only a few days before made his seasonal inspection of the field hands ' cabins , finding several of them in a state of sorry dilapidation . This day Goat and I would set up the two-by-fours as underpinningfor a couple of new floors ; afflicted by the summer 's seepage and rot , many of the old timbers had dissolved into a kind of crumbling splintery sawdust , the cabins themselves then exposed to the raw damp earth and infested by field mice , roaches , ants , beetles , and worms . Although I had grown very fond of my apprenticeship as a carpenter and took pride in my growing mastery of the craft , I despised with a passion that part of my job which required me to work on repairs to the cabins . For one thing alone ( and this in spite of all Marse Samuel 's efforts to teach a fundamental cleanliness ) there was the odor  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of rancid pork and crotch and armpit and black toil and straw ticks stained with babies ' vomit  --  an abyssal odor of human defeat revolting and irredeemable . " Ai , yi , yi , " Goat would whisper to the air in his German rattle , " dese people is not animals even , " and lifting a post or beam would make a convulsive face and spit on the floor . At such moments despite myself , the blood-shame , the disgrace I felt at being a nigger also , was as sharp as a sword through my guts . But that bright morning , appearing at the shop door with a cheery smile , Marse Samuel rescued me before I had even gotten well along on my task . " Throw a saddle on Judy , Nat , " he said , " we 're off to Jerusalem . " Behind the look of humor onp185his face there was something secretive , conspiratorial , and he lowered his voice to say : " Come November third , Miss Nell and I will have been married for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this anniversary with an appropriate gift . " He plucked me by the sleeve of my shirt , drawing me outside the shop . " Come now , let 's saddle Judy and Tom . I need company to share this splendid day . But you must n't breathe a word about the gift , Nat ! " He looked about him right and left , as if fearful of being overheard , then said in a whisper : " Someone sent news from over at the Vaughans ' place that a jeweler from Richmond will be passing today through town . " I was of course wonderfully pleased  --  not alone because I was freed of an ugly job but because I liked riding so much and always stole a ride on the rare occasions I was given the opportunity , and also because Jerusalem itself was an excitingplace for me ; although it was no more than fifteen miles away , I had been there only once several years before and then the little village touched me with wonder despite the solemnity of our mission . That time too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wagon , to help pick out a headstone for my mother 's grave . No cedar headboard for her , no weedfilledcorner of some field splashed with tatterdemalion wildflowers . My mother , alone among all the Negroes at Turner 's Mill , had been laid honorably to rest in the family plot among white folks ( scant yards away , indeed , from the unsentimentalBenjamin , now spinning in his coffin ) with a marble headstone not one inch smaller nor a shade less white than theirs . I am no longer oppressed by the fact ( as I was for so many years after I had grown to manhood and was able to reflect long and hard on these matters ) that the name on that headstone was not a nigger woman 's forlorn though honest " Lou-Ann " but the captured , possessed , owned " Lou-Ann Turner . " We rode out the long front lane over a carpet of fallenp186leaves . At the entrance to the lane half a dozen field hands supervised by Abraham were clearing a drainage canal which rimmed a part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they in turn stood erect and grinned in a servile show of doffed hats and loose-limbed droll shufflings , shouting back : " Mawnin ' , massah ! " and " Fare ' ee well , Marse Sam ! " I eyed them with aloof , privileged disdain . Their calls echoed behind us even as we set out through the woods by way of a leaf-strewn sunken wagon track leading toward the log road which would take us to Jerusalem . It was a gusty , brilliant morning alive with tossing branches and swirling eddies of leaves beneath us . Marse Samuel 's horse , a glitteringblack Irish hunter , quickly set the pace and took the lead and for half an hour or so we rode without speaking through the forest until finally , slackening his gait , Marse Samuel let me draw abreast and then I heard him say : " I hear that you are quite a young craftsman . " I found no way to answer these words which were both so pleasing and discomfiting , and I kept quiet , risking only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shifting my gaze a bit . I saw a pleasant twinkly look on his face , a kind of half-smile as if he were on the verge of divulging a secret . He sat upon a horse with great style and presence ; his flowing hair had become a silverygray in the past few years , and more lines creased and webbed his face , adding to his dignity ; for an instant I imaginedI was riding in the company of a great Biblical hero  --  Joshua perhaps , or Gideon before the extermination of the Midianites . I could say nothing as usual ; my awe of him was so great that there were moments when I could no more reply to him than if someone had sewn up my lips . " Mr. Goat told me that you planed down and finished twenty sills and chimney gilts as smooth and as clean as could be , mortice and tenons and all and not one bad joint nor a single timber to throw away in the lot ! Fine work , my excellent young carpenter ! What I expect I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge then of telling me what he had to say later ? Perhaps . But I do not really know , for at that instant Marse Samuel 's horse suddenly reared in a panic and the mare too heaved up beneath me , neighing with alarm , and across the wagon trace three deer bolted in high bounds from a thicket , a buck and two does dappled in the leafy morning light ; they flew past us in floating shapes wild-eyed and silent until one after another they struck the blanket of leaves on the far side of the road and vanished into the woods with a clamorous diminishing storm of thudding hooves and snappingbranches . " Hoo , Tom ! " Marse Samuel shouted , reining in his horse , calming him , and I too tightened in the mare , and for a moment we stood there in the checkered flickering light , gazing at the place where the white tails of the deer had melted into the woods , listening as the sound of the plunging feet vanished far off among the trees . But it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they 'd have been on top of us , Nat ! " Marse Samuel called with an uneasy laugh , and he swung Tom around and galloped ahead , saying no more until a few minutes later when the wagon trace ended , merging with the log road which led to Jerusalem . " Then shall the lame man leap as a hart , " he said , glancing back at me , " and the tongue of the dumb sing : for in the wilderness  --  How does it go , Nat ? " " For in the wilderness shall waters break out , and streams in the desert , " I answered . " And the parched ground shall become a pool , and the thirsty land springs of water : in the habitation of dragons , where each lay , shall be grass with reeds and rushes . " " Yes , yes , " he replied . We had drawn to a stop near the end of the trace , beneath a grove of gnarled and ancient apple trees once part of a large cultivated grove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fallen from the branches apples by the bushel lay in disordered piles and rows in a shallow ditch at the edge of the trace ; scattered ranks of the red and yellowish fruit were faintlyp188rotting with a cidery odor . Even as we stood there others fell , plop-plopping on the ground . Gnats swarmed over all , barely visible , and the two horses bent down their necks and began to munch at the apples with succulent crunching sounds . " Yes , yes , " Marse Samuel said , " I had forgotten . I had forgotten . " He smiled suddenly , adding : " By God 's grace I can afford to forget the Bible with you to rely on . For in the wilderness shall waters break out and streams in the desert  --  Lord Almighty , would that it were really so ! " He looked about him for a moment , searching the distances with a hand shielding his eyes from the bright sun . " Lord Almighty ! " he said again . " What a desolate prospect hereabouts ! " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ordinary : apple trees , road , fields , distant woodland  --  all seemed to be in place . He turned and regarded me soberly . " Those deer now , Nat . Take those deer for example . Used to be you never saw any deer on this trace , up in this quarter . Too many people around that kept them down . Fifteen , sixteen years ago when you were but a small tadpole the woods would be resounding with gunfire in November , December when old John Colemanand his boys would be laying up venison . They kept the deer population down to a proper size . Let his darkies hunt , too . Had a big driver named Friday who was one of the best deer shots in all of Southampton . But it 's all gone now . When the deer come back it means poor times . It means the people have gone . " He looked around again , the expression on his face still earnest , worried , thoughtful . " This grove here , " he murmured , " John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave the sweetest Jonathans ever you might ask for . Now look at them , all gone to pieces , fit only for the worms . God , what a pity ! What a waste and a shame ! " He said little else for a while as we rode at a slow canter toward Jerusalem . Something seemed to have taken possessionof his thoughts and he remained buried within himself ,  |p189lost  in some troubled reverie which contrasted suddenly and puzzlingly with his happy mood of the early morning but which of course I could not presume to intrude upon . We rode in silence for an hour or a little more , the log road lying straight and level as a roofbeam before us , the woods at eitherside like a whispery wall , wind-thrashed and afire with leaves . Here , unlike the tamed land around Turner 's Mill , it seemed a true wilderness , for the copper and gold landscape was astir with wilderness life : partridge and pheasant sprang up beyond the edge of the road , and from the forest 's windsweptroof fat grouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cottontails crisscrossed the road all along the way . Once a red fox considered us from his perch on the trunk of a fallen oak ; seated panting , grinning , his tongue lolled out between rows of small wicked teeth . Yet even as we rode along I was made aware  --  because of what Marse Samuel had said  --  of the strange bleak tracts of land which at intervals broke up the forest , patches of scrubby bramble-choked earth which had once been tobacco fields but now lay in fallow ruin . Scrub oak and pine saplings poked up through these meadows ; the earth was raw and weedy and great stretches of chalky , storm-runneled earth upon which nothing could grow blotched the landscape like open wounds . Here and there a forlorn last growth of stripped tobacco stalks stuck up through the briers in stiff withered spines . As we rode past one of these fields I could see on the far horizon the remnant of a great old farmhouse with its roof caved in ; the tumbledown outbuildings surroundingit , rotting and abandoned like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distant view even more sinister , and I turned away from it , beginning to share Marse Samuel 's pensive mood without knowing exactly why , and rode silently along behind him as the woods closed in again on either side around us . There was little movement on the road , and such of it asp190there was seemed to be coming toward us , away from Jerusalem : two peddlers ' wagons , several farmers in gigs and buggies  --  all of whom Marse Samuel hailed , being hailed warmly in return with elaborate , deferential greetings  --  and a half-blind old free Negro woman named Lucy , a ragpicker well known in the region , quite drunk and crazed and astride a spavined motheaten mule , who when Marse Samuel pressed a few pennies into her bleached palm , cackled in a voice which followed us for half a mile : " Gress yo ' soul , Marse Samuel , you Jesus hisself ! Yes , you des Jesus hisself . . . Jesus hisself . . . Jesus hisself ! " In the outline of a vast arrowhead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ south high in the pure blue above ; a gust of wind caught Marse Samuel 's cloak , blowing it about his head , and as he reached up to recover it he said : " How old are you now , Nat ? Eighteen , am I correct ? " " Yes sir , Marse Samuel , I turned eighteen first day of this month . " " Mr. Goat has splendid things to tell me about you , " he went on . " It 's really most remarkable the progress you 've made . " He turned to look at me with the suggestion of a smile . " You 're quite an unusual darky , I suppose you know . " " Yes sir , Marse Samuel , I reckon I am . " I do not recall replying with immodesty ; that I was in many ways both exceptionaland fortunate was a fact of which I had long been well aware . " You have by no means acquired what is known as a liberaleducation , " he said . " That was not my intention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that young people of your race will get that kind of learning someday . But you seem to be equipped now with the best part of an elementary schooling . You can read and write , and you can count . You have the most amazing knowledge of the Good Book of anyonewithin my ken , and that includes several white ministers I know . You will doubtless take on much more learning asp191you go forward , so long as books are within your reach . In addition to all this you have gained command of a craft , and are exceedingly skillful at everything which has been taught you . You are the walking proof of what I have tried so hard and usually so vainly to persuade white gentlemen , including my late beloved brother , namely , that young darkies like yourself can overcome the natural handicaps of their race and at least acquire such schooling as will allow them to enter into pursuits other than the lowest menial animal labor . Do you understand what I am getting at , Nat ? " " Yes sir , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine . " " In three years you will be twenty-one , you will have attained your manhood . Until then I wish to see you function on a new basis at the Mill . Commencing tomorrow , you will work only half a day at the shop under Mr. Goat 's direction . During the rest of the time you will act as assistant driver on the plantation , working together with Abraham in controlling the affairs of the fields and the mill itself but answerable only to me . During some of that time this fall I will be seeking your assistance in putting my library in order , it is in sorry need of straightening out . That last shipment from the factor in London contained over one hundred volumes in agronomy and horticulture alone , not to speak of the rest of my books and those of my father 's which stand in need of arrangement . Do you think you can help me in all this ? " " I will certainly try , Marse Samuel , I will most surely do my best . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit of a trick for you as yet , but you will learn in the process and I think all in all we shall manage handsomely . " He had reined in his horse , and I stopped too ; now we stood abreast at the edge of the road and Marse Samuel clutched the pommel of his saddlein a gloved hand , watching me gravely . The road was empty of travelers here , desolate , traversed by small whirlwindsof brown leaves and gritty dust . Flat fields of briersp192rolled away to the rim of the horizon , a wasteland of dying thorns ; somewhere far off a wildfire in the woods burned unchecked and its fragrance , sharp with cedar , floated around us in a powdery sweet haze . " Now , I have long debated in my mind and heart , " he went on slowly , " whether to tell you of this other decision , for fear that it would hinder you in some way or cause you to occupy your head with fanciful notions when you should be attending to your work . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell me but there was something in the tone of his voice that put me on the alert , anticipating , and in a wild and sudden fantasy I thought : Maybe he 's going to say that if I do everything right he 'll give me old Judy ; he let Abraham have a horse only two years ago .. . " When I was up in Richmond this last August , I saw Mr. Bushrod Pemberton , who has taken a great interest in the news I have had to convey to him in regard to you  --  " A vision of the mare disappeared , and I was thinking instead : What has Richmond got to do with me ? And Mr. Bushrod Pemberton ? What does either of them got to do with anything in the world ? " Mr. Pemberton is one of the wealthiest gentlemen in Richmond . He is an architect and a builder of houses and he is in great need of skilled hands right now . Besides being a man of cultivation and learning , Mr. Pemberton shares most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In his business in Richmond he employs many accomplished free Negroes and slaves as carpenters , bricklayers , tinsmiths , and other artisans . What I propose to do , Nat , is simply this . If all goes well with you during the next three years  --  and I have no reason to doubt that anything will go awry  --  " He 's going to hire me out , I thought , he 's going to hire me out to Mr. Pemberton , that 's what he 's going to do . I began to feel a creeping fear , thinking : So he trained me all thesep193years just so he could hire me out in Richmond to Mr. BushrodPemberton "  --  Then I shall send you to Mr. Pemberton , under whose employ you will work as a carpenter for the following four years . Mr. Pemberton lives in a beautiful old home in the shadow of St. John 's Church . I have seen the quarters where he sleeps his servants ; they are in a quiet alleyway behind the house and I can tell you , Nat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place to live . Another thing , Mr. Pemberton is engaged in building a block of fine row houses in the center of town , and I expect you will fit in perfectly on the job from the very beginning . You will pay me half of the wages you earn from him  --  " So it is all as simple as that . He 's getting rid of me . And so what all this means is that I will have to go away from Turner'sMill . It ai n't fair . It ai n't fair. "  --  retaining the other half for yourself in savings for the future . Thereupon , at Mr. Pemberton 's good report of your labor  --  and again I have no doubt that this might be anything but exemplary  --  I shall draw up the papers for your emancipation . You will then at the age of twenty-five be a free man . " He paused and gave my shoulder a soft nudge with his gloved fist , adding : " I shall only stipulate that you return to Turner 's Mill for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darky girl you have taken for a wife ! " Suddenly I realized that he was trembling with emotion . He ceased talking and blew his nose with a loud honk . Baffled , helpless , I opened my mouth but my lips parted on a fragile wisp of air , unable to speak a word , and just at that moment he turned aside brusquely and tapped his horse into a quick trot , calling back : " Come on , Nat , time 's flying ! We must get to Jerusalem before that jeweler has sold out all his pearls ! " A free man . Never in a nigger boy 's head was there such wild sudden confusion . For as surely as the fact of bondagep194itself , the prospect of freedom may generate ideas that are immediately obsessed and half crazy , so I think I am being quite exact in saying that my first reaction to this awesome magnanimity was one of ingratitude , panic , and self-concern . And the reasons were as simple and as natural as a heartbeat . Because such was my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woods and the serene and familiar landscape which had composed my entire memory and the fact of my becoming and had fashioned me into what I was  --  that the idea of leaving it filled me with a homesickness so keen that it was like a bereavement . To part from a man like Marse Samuel , whom I regarded with as much devotion as it was possible to contain , was loss enough ; it seemed almost insupportableto say good-bye to a sunny and generous household which , black though I was , had cherished me as a child and despite all  --  despite the unrelenting fact of my niggerness , the eternal subservience of my manner and the leftovers I ate even now and my cramped servant 's room and the occasional low chores I was still compelled to do , and the near-drowned yet lingering and miserable recollection of my mother in a drunken overseer 's arms  --  had been my benign and peaceable universe for eighteen years . To be shut away from this was more than I thought I could bear . " But I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself howling at Marse Samuel , galloping after him now . " I do n't want to work for any Mr. Pemberton ! Naw sir ! " I cried . " Unhunh , I want to stay right here ! " ( Thinking now of my mother'swords long ago , and still another fear : Druther be a low cornfield nigger or dead than a free nigger . Dey sets a nigger free and only thing dat po ' soul gits to eat is what 's left over of de garbage after de skunks an ' dogs has et . . . ) " Naw ! " I yelled . " Unh-unhl " But all I could hear was Marse Samuel shouting not to me but to his horse , now plunging ahead through flying and pinwheeling billows of autumn leaves : " Hey , Tom ! Old Natp195wo n't feel that way for . . . long . . . will . . . he . . . boy ! " And of course he was right . For many months afterward I worried off and on about my future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away even that morning as we approached Jerusalem , when like some blessed warmth there slowly crept over me an understanding of this gift of my own salvation , which only one in God knew how many thousands of Negroes could hope ever to receive , and was beyond all prizing . I would have , after all , several years before I 'd be leaving Turner 's Mill . As for the rest , to be a free man in a fine city working at a trade he cherished was not a fate to be despised ; many a poor outcast white man had inherited far less , and therefore I should give thanks unto the Lord . I did so that day in Jerusalem , while waiting for Marse Samuel in the shadow of a stable wall , taking my Bible from the saddlebagand praying alone on my knees while carts clattered by and the sound of a blacksmith 's hammer rang out like the clang of a cymbal : 0 God , thou art my God ; early will I seek Thee . . . because thy lovingkindness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. . Yet that afternoon on the way back to Turner 's Mill , just as my joy and exultancy grew and I listened to Marse Samuel describe the kind of good work that would be in store for me in Richmond ( he too was in radiant spirits , he had bought Miss Nell a resplendent gold and enamel French brooch and was glowing with pride ) , we encountered on the road a sight so troubling that it was like a shape of darkness passing across the bright October sun , and it looms over my memory of this day as persistently as the recollection of some exhaustedmoment toward the year 's end when one looks out and finds that all is hushed and that night has begun to fall , and there steals over the tongue the first flat dead taste of winter . The slave coffle had halted at the side of the road , not far below the clearing where the wagon trace began . Had wep196started out ten minutes later it would have been on its way again , we should not have seen it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were about forty Negro men and boys skimpily clad in ragged cotton shirts and trousers ; they were linked to each other by chains that girdled their waists and each was manacledwith double cuffs of iron which now lay loose in their laps or on the ground . I had never seen Negroes in chains before . None of them spoke as we passed , and their silence was oppressive , abject , hurtful , and chilling . They sat or squatted in a line straggling through the fiery mounds of fallen leaves at the wayside ; some were chomping on handfulsof corn pone in a listless fashion , some dozed against each other , one gangling big fellow rose as we approached and wall-eyed and expressionless began to piss into the ditch , a small boy of eight or nine lay weeping desperately and hopelessly against a fat middle-aged shiny liver-colored man gone sound asleep where he sat . Still no one spoke , and as we moved on I heard only a faint chinking sound of their chains and now the single lugubrious plunking of a jew's-harp , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monotony , like someonepounding in senseless rhythm on a crowbar . The three drovers were youngish sort of sun-reddened men , fair-haired and mustached , and all wore muddy boots ; one of them carried a leather bullwhip and it was he who tipped his wide straw hat to Marse Samuel as we came up to them and stopped . The chains chinked faintly in the ditch , the jew'sharpwent bunk-bunk-bunk-bunk . " Where are you bound ? " Marse Samuel said . He had lost all trace of his gaiety now , and his voice sounded disturbed and strained . " Dublin , in Georgia , sir , " was the reply . " And where do you hail from ? " he asked . " Up in Surry County , near Bacon 's Castle , sir . They done broke up the Ryder plantation and these here is Ryder 's niggers. sir . Georgia bound , we is. "  | " When did you leave Surry ? " Marse Samuel said . " Morning of the day afore yesterday , " the drover said . " We 'd be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark somewheres up in Sussex and got ourselves proper lost for a bit . " He grinned suddenly , exposing teeth so black with tobacco stain that they seemed almost lost in the hollow of his mouth . " It ai n't always easy to find the way down here , sir . In Jerusalem we got many misdirections . Are we headed the right way for Carolina and the routes south , sir ? " But Marse Samuel failed to respond to the question then , exclaiming in a voice touched with disbelief : " The Ryder plantation too ! And these are the Ryder Negroes . Lord God , things must be getting bad up there when  --  " But abruptly he broke off and said in reply : " Yes , you should arrive at Hicks ' Ford after nightfall . Then I believe there is an overland trace which will take you across the line to Gaston , thence down to Raleigh by the regular route . When do you expect to reach your destination in Georgia ? " " Well , sir , " the drover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gang of niggers from Virginia down to Georgia though never from Surry before on account of the trading gentleman I works for is Mr. Gordon Davenport , who has bought most of his niggers up on t' other side of the James in counties like King William and New Kent . The niggers from up there is mostly old stock Lower Guinea niggers with short leg shanks and poor constitutionals and seeing as how you ca n't walk niggers like that for more'n twenty miles a day you 'd be lucky sometimes to make Savannah River inside of six weeks . And has to lash the mortal shit out'n ' em all the way . " He paused and spat into the leaves . " But see , sir , " he continued patiently to explain , " I happens to know that these Southside niggers from Surry and Isle of Wight and Prince George is most all of them late stock true Upper Guineamen with long shanks and healthy constitutionals , by and large ,  |p198and  you can get twenty-five even thirty miles a day out of ' em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever have to lay on none of ' em a stroke of the whip . Which is all fine with me . So I reckon that except for floods and such like we will fetch Dublin the second week in November . " " And so the Ryder place is finished too ! " Marse Samuel said after a long pause . " I knew it was failing but  --  so soon ! The last grand old place in Surry ; it is hard to believe ! " " ' Tai n't hard to believe , sir , " the drover said . " Land up there has got so miserable poor you ca n't make a gift of it . Ai n't nothing but the acorns to eat in Surry , sir . They says a bluejay flyin ' over has to tote his own food  --  " One of the other drovers began to chuckle and snort . As he spoke , my mare who was disposed to sidle at times sidestepped her way a few yards down the line away from the drovers , tossing her mane and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jew's-harp was dully strumming . Bunk-bunk . Suddenly the noise ceased and the mare jerked about and I could hear the chinking of the chains along the ditch and the child 's heartbroken wail as he sobbed without ceasing against the plump liver-colored grayhead who now blinked awake and cast rheum-filled dreamy eyes down at the little boy , murmuring : " Das awright . " He stroked the child on his kinky brown head and said again : " Das awright . " And then he began to repeat the phrase gently , over and over , as if ' they were the only words he knew : " Das awright . . . this awright ... " Without warning a gust of wind came up , and a moment 's shadow crossed the face of the day , and the frost-tinged shuddering breeze ran down the line of Negroes , shoveling the leaves up around their decrepit lumpish shoes , flicking the edges of their cotton sleeves and the cuffs of their gray tattered trousers . I felt myself give a shiver , then as quickly as it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blossom , and at that moment I heard at myp199elbow a voice soft and slick as satin : " Is n't you gwine give Raymond a nice sweet potato , honey chile ? " I ignored the voice , still listening to Marse Samuel , who was saying : " I presume they are separating Negro families in Surry then , otherwise you 'd have a number of women in this coffle . " " ' Deed I could n't say , sir , " the drover replied . " Mr. Davenport jest hires me to drive ' em . " " Pretty please , honey chile , " the voice below persisted , " is n't you got a nice sweet potato for ole Raymond ? Us is jes ' sick of apples . And pone . Sour apples from de road an ' pone . Us is jes ' sick of dat mess . Come on , honey , is n't you got a nice sweet potato fo ' Raymond ? Or a tiny ole piece of bacon ? " I looked down and saw a freckled ginger-colored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sparse reddish head . Thirty-five or perhaps forty , he had the blood in him somewhere of an Irish overseer or the scion of a James River manor or a traveling Pennsylvania tinker ; from the way he sat with a certain shabby yet subtle prestige  --  maybe it was the manner in which the two boys chained on either side had cozied up against him , or the impudence of the jew's-harp clutched in one thick clumsy hand  --  I could tell that deferencewas paid and due him : there was a Raymond on every plantation . It was surely owing to his white blood that Raymondachieved his eminence but also to some native bankerishwit and sagacity which , however forlornly crippled , made him store up a meager authority and was ever a beacon for all the others . What caused an eclipse of the moon ? Raymond knew . Hit caused by a gret mystery cloud flyin ' up out'n de swamp . Was there a way to cure rheumatism ? Ast old Ray . Make you a portice of turpentine wid red earthworms and de juice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Having a little trouble with your old woman at night ? Git you de cotton dat she 's thawed away when she got her monthlies and wear itp200sewed up inside yo ' pants , dat 'll start a woman humpin ' . When would the niggers be free ? In 1842 , I seed it in a dream , niggers led by a wooden-legged white man from up in Paris , France . And so the talk goes round among the niggers : Ast ole Ray . Raymond he know near ' bout ev'ything in de whole wide world . Wo n't it be bad times down in Georgia ? Naw , dat 's rich peopleses ' country , dat 's why us is goin ' dar . Niggers down in Georgia eats fried eggs three times a day .. . " What yo ' name , sweet ? " he whispered up at me . " Nat , " I said . " Nat Turner . " " Where you live at , honey chile ? " " Live at Turner 's Mill , " I said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I uttered next that I have wondered since why the Lord did not wrench out my tongue . " My mastah 's goin ' to set me free in Richmond . " " Well , ai n't dat jes ' de nicest thing , " said Raymond . " God 's truth , " I replied . " Come on , sugah , " he importuned in his glossy voice , " don ' a rich nigger boy like you got a bite to eat for ole Raymond ? My , dat 's a pretty bag on dat saddle . I bets dey 's all kinds of nice things to eat in dat bag . Come on , sugah , give ole Raymond a bite to eat . " " Dey 's on'y a Bible in dat bag ! " I said impatiently , thoughfull-lapsed into a field nigger 's tongue . I gave the mare a slapbehind the ears , checking her crabwise gait , and brought herabout toward Marse Samuel . Late afternoon had begun tosettle down upon us as we stood there , it had grown cold . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through wood smoke and haze lay streaming upon a tangleddesolation of weeds and brambles , so furiously luminousthat it seemed a field ready to explode into fire . Drawing nearMarse Samuel I heard the jew's-harp again , bunk-bunk-bunk . " Come , we must be on our way , " he said to me , wheelingabout , and we turned together then ; for some reason I hesitatedand stopped entirely , gazing back , and he said again :  | " Quickly ! Quickly ! We must be on our way ! " Now moving again down the long line of Negroes , I was aware that the jew's-harp had stopped playing ; we came by the place where Raymond sat in his chains and I heard him call to me as we trotted past  --  the voice sweet and slow , highpitched , not unkind , as ever knowing and prophetic and profound : " Yo ' shit stink too , sugah . Yo ' ass black jes ' like mine , honey chile . " At along about this time in my life  --  it must have been the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named Willis . Save for Wash and my mother and house servants like Little Morning , Willis was the first Negro I was ever close to . Two or three years younger than I , the son of a woman who had done much of the weaving at the Mill and who had died that winter of some lung complaint , he had caught Marse Samuel 's eye as a suitable replacement for me in the carpenter'sshop , now that my duties called for me to work in the shop only half a day . As soon as I saw him at work , learning how to plane and hammer under the tutelage of Goat , I could understand why Marse Samuel had chosen him to be my successor , for unlike most Negro boys  --  who become clumsy and ruined for anything but the sloppiest jobs after four or five years of bent-over toil chopping and hoeing in the cornfields , and in whose hands a hammer only turned into a weapon to fracture their own shins  --  Willis was skillful and neat , a quick learner , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had done . He could not read or write a word , of course , but he had a sunny , generous , obliging natureand was full of laughter ; despite my early suspicion of him  --  a hangover from my lifelong contempt of all black people who dwelt down the slope  --  I found something irresistibleabout his gaiety and his innocent , open disposition and we became fast friends . Considering my habitual scorn , I do not know why this happened : perhaps it was as if I hadp202found a brother . He loved to sing as he worked , helping me brace a timber , the voice a soft little rhythmical chatter : " Gon na milk my cow , gon na catch her by de tail , Gon na milk her in de coffee pot , po ' it in de pail . " He was a slim , beautiful boy with fine-boned features , very gentle and wistful in repose , and the light glistened like oil on his smooth black skin . His only faith , like most of the Negroes ' , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cock of a bull that had died of the bloat he had tied up three fuzzy patches on his head , to ward off ghosts ; the fangs of a water moccasin he wore on a string around his neck , a charm against fever . His talk was childish and guileless and obscene . I was very fond of him ; feeling thus , I was troubled for his soul and longed to bring him out of ignorance and superstition and into the truth of Christian belief . It was not easy at first  --  leading this simple , unformed , and childlike spirit to an understanding of the way and an acceptance of the light  --  but I can recall several things working in my favor . There was his intelligence for one thing , as I have said : unlike so many of the other black boys , half drowned from birth in a kind of murky mindlessness hi which there appeared not the faintest reflection of a world beyond the cabin and the field and the encompassing woods , Willis was like some eager , fluttering young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to uncage him . Perhaps growing up near the big house had something to do with this , only briefly had he known the drudgery of the fields . But there was also the mere fact of his nature , which was  --  different . He had come into life blessed with an unencumbered , happy spirit , bright and open to learning ; everything about him was lively , dancing , gay , free of that stupid and brutish inertia of children born to the plow and the hoe . More than all this , however , was the sway I kept over him by virtue of what I had simply become . I possessed an un/usual position and authority , especially for a Negro who was so young , and I was certainly fully conscious of the respect and even awe in which I was held by all the black people at the Mill now that it had become known that I was second only to Abraham in control . ( Being too young , too dumb , too prideful at the time , I could not have realized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot thronged with toiling Negroes , aloof , disdainful , intoning from a requisition in a voice ostentatiously educated and loud  --  how much sour resentment boiled behind those awed , respectful glances . ) Owning such power and advantaging myself of Willis 's innocenceand the trust he had in me , I was able eventually to bring him into an awareness of God 's great handiwork and the wonder of His presence abiding in all the firmament . Do not think ill of me when I confess that it was during these hours with Willis in that spring of my eighteenth year , prayingwith him in the stillness of a noontime meadow , exhorting him to belief as I clutched my Bible with one hand and with the other pressed long and hard on the smooth heft of his shoulder until I could feel him shudder and sigh in response to my whispered supplications  --  " Oh Lord , receive this poor boy Willis , receive him into Thy almighty care , receive him into belief , yes , Lord , yes , yes , he believes , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Das right , Lawd , Willis he believes "  --  do not think ill of me , I say , when I confess that then for the first time like a yellow burst of sunlight which steals out from behind a cloud and floods the day , there swept over me the mysterious sense of my own hidden yet implacable and onrushing power . That spring I remember we went fishing together on Saturdays and Sundays . A muddy creek wound through the swamp beyond the millpond . The walnut-brown water was thick with bream and catfish and we sat long morning hours in a swarm of gnats on the slippery clay bank , angling with pine poles we made in the shop , our hooks fashioned fromp204bent nails upon which we skewered crickets and earthworms . Far off the mill groaned , a muffled watery rushing and mumbling . The light here was diaphanous , the air warm and drowsy , astir with darting buggy shapes and the chattering of birds . One day , his finger pricked by a hook or the sharp spine of a fish , Willis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yelled  --  and so swiftly that I hardly knew what I was doing I rapped him sharply across the lips , drawing a tiny runnel of blood . " A filthy mouth is an abomination unto the Lord ! " I said . His face wore a broken , hurt look and he reached up to lightly finger the place where I had struck him . His round eyes were soft and childlike , trusting , and suddenly I felt a pang of guilt and pain at my anger , and a rush of pity swept through me , mingled with a hungry tenderness that stirred me in a way I have never known . Willis said nothing , his eyes were brimming with tears ; I saw the moccasin fangs dangling at his neck , bone-white and startling against his shiny bare black chest . I reached up to wipe away the blood from his lips , pulling him near with the feel of his shoulders slippery beneath my hand , and then we somehow fell on each other , very close , soft and comfortable in a sprawl like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulsed like the throat of a pigeon , and I heard him sigh in a faraway voice , and then for a long moment as if set free into another land we did with our hands together what , before , I had done alone . Never had I known that human flesh could be so sweet . Minutes afterward I heard Willis murmur : " Man , I sho liked dat . Want to do it agin ? " For a time I could n't bring myself to look at him , averting my eyes , keeping my gaze up toward the sun through leaves atremble like a forest of green fluttering moths . Finally I said : " The soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David , and Jonathan loved him as his own soul . " Time passed and Willis said nothing , then I heard himp205fidget on the ground next to me , and he said , chuckling : " You know what jizzom puts me in mind of , Nat ? Hit look jes ' lak buttermilk . Look dere . " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which at the same time I felt to be a danger and a. warning . I recall a catbird high in the water oak above , swinging like a rag amid the branches , jabbering and screeching ; gnats whirred madly in the air around my ears , beneath my skull the clay bank was as cold as a sliver of ice . They kissed one another , and wept one with another , I thought , until David exceeded . And he rose and departed . And Jonathanwent into the city .. . " Come on , " I said , rising . He pulled his pants up and I led him to the edge of the creek . " Lord , " I said in a loud voice , " witness these two sinners who have sinned and have been unclean in Thy sight and stand in need to be baptized . " " Das right , Lawd , " I heard Willis say . In the warmth of the spring air I suddenly felt the presence of the Lord very close , compassionate , all-redeeming , allunderstanding , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves and the brown water and the chatteringbirds . Real yet unreal , He seemed about to reveal Himself , as fresh and invisible as a breath of wind upon the cheek . It was almost as if God hovered in the shimmering waves of heat above the trees , His tongue and His almighty voice trembling at the edge of speech , ready to make known His actual presence to me as I stood penitent and prayerful with Willis ankle-deep in the muddy waters . Through and beyond the distant roaring of the mill I thought I heard a murmuration and another roaring far up in the heavens , as if from the throats of archangels . Was the Lord going to speak to me ? I waited faint with longing , clutching Willis tightly by the arm , but no words came from above  --  only the sudden presence of God poised to shower Himself down like summerp206rain , and the wild and many-voiced , distant , seraphic roaring . " Lord , " I cried , " Thy servant Paul has said : And now why tarriest thou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sins , calling on the name of the Lord . That 's what he said , Lord , that 's what he said ! You know that , Lord ! " " Amen ! " Willis said . Beneath my fingers I could feel him begin to stir and shudder and another " Amen ! " came from him in a gasp . " Das right , Lawd ! " Again I waited for God 's voice . For an instant indeed I thought He spoke but it was only the rushing of the wind high in the treetops . My heart pounded wildly and I recall thinking then : Maybe not now . Maybe He do n't want to speak now , but at another time . A thrill of joy coursed through me as I thought : He 's just testing me now . He 's just seeing if I can baptize . He 's going to save His voice for another time . That 's all right , Lord . I turned to Willis , tugging at his arm , and together we went out into water waist-high where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Off near the other bank a little water snake scurried along like a whip on the surface of the creek , in frantic S-shaped ripples disappeared upstream ; I took it as a good omen . " For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body , " I said , " whether we be Jews or Gentiles , whether we be bond or free , and have been all made to drink into one Spirit ... " " Amen , " said Willis . I grasped the back of his head and shoved him under , pressed him down beneath the foaming murky waters . It was the instant of my first baptism , and the swift brief exaltation I felt brought a sudden flood of tears to my eyes . After a second or two I brought him up in a cloud or bubbles , and as he stood there dripping and puffing like a kettle but with a smile as sweet as beatitude itself on his shining face , I addressed myself to the blue firmament . " Lord , I am a sinner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these redeeming waters . Let me henceforth be dedicated to Thyp207service . Let me be a preacher of Thy holy word . In Jesus ' name , amen . " And then I baptized myself . Walking back to the Mill that afternoon we passed down a lane of dogwood , white and pink in wanton lovely splashes , and a mockingbird seemed to follow us through the woods , making a liquid chanting sound among the wild green leaves . Willis kept up a steady excited chatter all the way  --  we had caught half a dozen bream  --  but I paid little heed to him , being lost in thought . For one thing , I knew that I must consecrate myself to the Lord 's service from this point on , as I had promised Him , avoiding at all costs such pleasures of the flesh as I had experienced that morning . If I could be shaken to my very feet by this unsought-for encounter with a boy , think what it might be , I reflected , think what an obstaclewould be set in my path @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a woman ! Difficult as it might become , I must bend every effort toward purity of mind and body so as to unloose my thoughts in the direction of theological studies and Christian preaching . As for Willis  --  well , I realized now that loving him so much , loving him as a brother , I should do everything within my power to assure his own progress in the way of the Lord . I must first try to teach him to read and write  --  I figured he was still not too old for learning ; that accomplished , maybe it was not beyond the bounds of possibility that Marse Samuel might be persuaded that Willis , too , was fit for freedom and could be set loose in the outer world  --  Richmond perhaps !  --  with a grand job and a house and family . It would be hard to describe how much it pleased me to think of Willis free like myself in the city , the two of us dedicated to spreading God 's word among the black people and to honest work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me with such hope and joy that I stopped on the path beneath the dogwood trees and there inp208the clear spring air knelt with Willis in thanksgiving and blessed him in the Lord 's name , replacing before I arose again his moccasin fangs with a tiny white cross I had carved from the shinbone of an ox . Whenever in later times I recollected that day and thought of my first eighteen years , it seemed to me that all that long while it was as if I had been mounting a winding and pleasant slope toward the distant hills of the Lord , and that that day was a kind of promontory on the way . Not knowing the future , I had expected to pause at this lofty place and then go on , proceeding upward by gentle stages to the remote , free , glorious peaks where lay the satisfaction and fulfillment of my destiny . Yet as I say , whenever I reflectedupon that eighteenth year of mine and that day and the events which quickly followed , it was plain to me that this promontory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : beyond that place there was no gentle , continuing climb toward the great hills but a sudden astonishing abyss into which I was hurled like a willow leaf by the howling winds . One long weekend late that spring there was to be a Baptist camp meeting just outside of Jerusalem . A wellknownrevivalist named Deacon Jones would be the leader , coming all the way down from Petersburg , and Baptists for miles around were expected to meet there  --  hundreds and hundreds of planters and farmers and their families from a dozen counties , some traveling from as far away as the coast of North Carolina . Tents would be pitched , for four days and nights there would be singing and praying and feasting from wild turkey and barbecue . There would be a laying - on of hands and organ and banjo music , and general salvation for all lucky enough to attend . Some of the slaveowners , I knew , would bring what Negroes they owned and these privilegedp209souls too might partake of the spirit of the revival , and would be welcome just like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though few of them would get a taste of the turkey or the barbecue . When I learned of the camp meeting I became greatly excited , and I asked Marse Samuel if I might be permitted to go for the Saturday gathering , taking several of the servants in one of the wagons . I intended to include Willis and Little Morning , who had gotten religion many years before and who , ailing now and feeble and with a pitiful wandering mind , might be going to his last revival . Although Marse Samuel was an Episcopalian he had long ago put churchgoing out of his head ; yet he did not scorn the Bible and often sought ways that his Negroes might be led into religious instruction  --  I myself of course being the chief example . Thus when I asked him if I might go on this Saturdayexpedition he readily gave his permission and said that he would write out a pass for the group , warning me only that I should return before nightfall and that I must keep an eye on the other Negroes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowing darkies from some James or BlackwaterRiver plantation ; these were smart darkies who had been exposed to white rivermen and traders and thus to vice , and they would literally swindle our innocent backwoods Negroes out of their trousers or their shoes . Ever since the day I baptized Willis , I had begun to teach him to count and also to read , using my Bible as a primer and spelling out the words on the back wall of the shed next to the carpenter 's shop , with a cattail dipped in lampblack as a kind of brush to write the letters . It pleased me to see how quickly he responded to my instruction ; if I persevered , and took advantage of every opportunity , I was sure that it would not be long before he knew the alphabet and would be able to see the connection between the letters and the words in such a simple line as the third verse of the entire Bible , whichp210of course goes : And God said , Let there be light : and there was light . Willis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camp meeting . Although I myself had never been to such a revival , I knew from tales told long ago by my mother and Little Morning just what sort of colorful bustle and activity might be expected , and thus I was able to tell Willis all about it and infect him with my own anticipation . On the afternoon before the day of the camp meeting I borrowed two juicy pullets from Goat 's brood , promising to pay him back in extra work , and I made up a large and festive meal for us Negroes who were going  --  fried chicken , a rare treat , and a couple of loaves of shortening bread I was able to wheedle out of Abraham 's wife , who had become cook at the big house  --  and I put the chicken and bread in a small pine box together with a jug of sweet cider , placing all in the carpenter 's shed where it would be safe from pilfering black hands , and then went to bed at a very early hour since we would be leaving for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about midnight I was awakened by a soft whisper and , suspended like clinking bells above my face , the tinkling of a lantern in whose sudden yellow glow the eyes of a little Negro girl were as round as eggshells . It was one of Wash 's younger sisters  --  another of Abraham 's numberless children  --  and she mumbled that I must come down to the cabin right away , her daddy had sent her , her daddy was miserable sick . I dressed and followed the girl down the slope through the moonlit , katydid-filled , balmy night and there in the cabin found Abraham as the girl had said , feverish and in bed , coughing and hacking away , his broad black chest glistening with streams of sweat in the glare of the lamp . " ' T'ai n't nothin ' , Nat , " he said weakly . " Hit jes ' de misery I gits ev'y springtime . I gwine be awright come next week . " After a pause he went on : " But nem'mine dat . Marse Samuel done told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de trace begins at two in de mawnin ' . What time hit now ? "  | " I just heard the clock ring twelve , " I said . " What boys you talking about , Abe ? " " Marse Samuel done hired out four boys to chop tobacco fo ' two weeks over to de Vaughans ' place . Vaughan 's got a wagon dat 's gwine meet our wagon up whar de trace commences . I uz supposed to carry dem boys up dere but now I got dis misery , so you got to carry ' em , Nat . Dat 's at two o'clock , so git on now an ' let dis po ' sick man rest his bones . I gwine be awright . " " But I 'm goin ' to the camp meeting , Abe , " I started to protest , " all this time I figured on the camp meeting  --  " " You kin still go to de camp meetin ' , boy . " he insisted , " you jes ' ai n't gwine git a whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ git on , Nat , and carry dem boys on up dere in de wagon . Dey waitin ' right now behin ' de stable . Here , you got to take dis yere paper . " Of course Abraham was right about the camp meeting : I might still make it to the beginning of the trace and back , pick up Willis and Little Morning and the others and be off to Jerusalem just as I had planned  --  provided only that I was willing to do without sleep , a minor burden . What I had not counted on , however , was that among those four Negro boys I must take to meet the Vaughans ' wagon , among those sleepy black faces upturned to the moonlight in the hushed luminous space of ground behind the stable 's lowering wall , was that of Willis himself , and my heart gave a sickening heave as I caught sight of him and as there came over me a chill , clammy sense of betrayal . " But he said you could go to the camp meeting ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shortening their traces amid the manure-sweet stable gloom . Willis padded drowsily about barefooted in the darkness , helping me , saying not a word . " Daggone , Willis ! " I whispered urgently . " He did n't mention nothin ' at all about bein ' hired out to Major Vaughan . Nothin ' ! Now daggone it , you goin ' to be over atp212the Vaughans ' for two weeks choppin ' tobacco and maybe it 'll be a whole ' nother year before you get to go to a camp meetin ' . " I was nearly frantic with disappointment , and the radiant globe of pleasure and anticipation in which I had buoyantly dwelt for so long cracked and fell away from me like shattered glass as I yanked the mules out onto the moondrenchedlawn and , wildly impatient , urged the boys up into the wagon . " Daggone it , " I said , " I fixed fried chicken and there 's cider too ! C'm on , nigger boys , move yo ' butts ! " The three other boys scampered up over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they giggled nervously as they clambered into the wagon ; all three of them wore rabbits ' feet attached to a leather bracelet on the left ankle  --  that year a plantation fashion ; one boy was able to disgorge at will large bullfrog belches and this he began to do without ceasing , bringing forth from the other boys squeals of childishlaughter . Willis climbed onto the seat beside me . " ' Mt up , mules ! " I said angrily . It was the first time I had ever felt even the trace of disillusionment with Marse Samuel and this strange new feeling itself added to my distress . " Daggone Marse Samuel anyway ! " I said to Willis as we set forth down the lane . " If he was going to hire you out to the Vaughans for two weeks , how come he did n't tell me and you first so we would n't get all prepared about goin ' to the camp meeting ? " In a little while my chagrin and anger drained away , fadingoff into that mood of resignation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no matter what the occasion . After all , there were worse blows , I figured as we rocked along slowly through the moon-white woods ; suppose Willis could not go to this camp meeting , did it really matter ? Certainly there would come along other revivals I could take him to , and his failure to attend this one would make but a tiny gap in his spiritual education . I looked at him tenderly as the moon spread a pale light over his features ; nodding next to me , he was half asleep , his delicate lips apart and hisp213eyelids fluttering in a fight against slumber . I aroused him with a nudge and a question : " What 's two and three ? " " Five , " he said after a pause , rubbing his eyes . " Arid three and four ? " " Seven . " He began to say something else , hesitated , then went on : " Nat , how come you figures Marse Samuel done hired me out ? I'se a ' prentice carpenter . " " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reckon they need extra hands over there . But that 's all right . Marse Samuel only hires out to good people , I know that , and the Vaughans are quality folk , treat you well . Anyway , listen , it ai n't but for two weeks , no time at all . Then you 'll be back and we 'll have more teaching . What 's three and eight ? " " Fo'teen , " he said , yawning hugely . Behind us in the cart the three boys had gone to sleep , sprawled against each other lifeless and limp in the moonlight . The night was clamorous with frogs and katydids , warm , fragrant with cedar , clear like day , the moon powderingthe trees in light as starkly white as the dust of bone . The lop-eared mules , plodding along with a crushed rasping sound against the dewy weeds , found their way ahead as if they knew the road by heart , and I let the reins go slack in my hand , drowsing too , and fitfully slept until the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the high wail of a bobcat miles off in the swamp , its distant scream echoing through some perplexed strange dream like the sound of claws scraped in anguish across the bare face of the heavens . Presently I felt Willis stir on the seat and sensed the other boys moving about behind me ; then I woke with a start and realized that the mules had stopped . Here in the moonlight at the end of the trace I saw the log road stretching east and west through the weeds and now against the trees the outline of the Vaughans ' wagon , huge and canvas-covered and motionless , the floppy white roof making it look like the picture of a sailing ship , foundered now upon the edge of the forest.  |p214The  figures of two white men disengaged themselves from the shadows of the wagon , and one of them  --  a portly gentleman with a plump aging face beneath a shiny wide-brimmed planter 's hat  --  approached as we sat there , and said to me in a not-disagreeable voice : " You Abraham ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I'se de numbah-two driver . Abraham he done took sick , yassuh , ' deed he took real sick . " Nigger gabble . He drew closer to the wagon and all of a sudden a tinkingmusical sound and a jaunty litttle tune interrupted the silence , sending a spooky chill up my back , and then I saw that the man had taken from his vest a silver watch and had opened it , and that it was from this watch that the music was coming , in miraculous plinkety notes , as if he held a tiny spinet piano and tiny pianist  --  I thought of one of the beribbonedTurner ladies  --  imprisoned in his hand . My wonderstruckeyes must have betrayed me , for the man said then : " Quite a little timepiece , no ? A triumph of the watchmaker 's art . That , my boy , is Loodwig van Beethoven . " He snapped the watch shut , strangling the music in mid-passage " And you are no more than ten minutes late and deserve praise for your promptitude . Look alive , boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chewing tobacco , which I caught in midair . " Now then , Abe  --  or what 's your name  --  you have four young hands for the Vaughans here , right ? And a paper for me to sign which you will take back to your master . " He turned aside from me for an instant and called in a breezy , amiable voice toward the back of the wagon : " All right , boys ! Up now into the other wagon ! Hop to , lads ! We 've nearly to Greensvillc County to go tonight . " Willis and the other boys scrambled down off their perch and moved somnolently toward the Vaughans ' great white wagon across the road . " Sleepyheads , I see ! " he said with a chuckle . " Well , you 'll find the Major 's wagon a cozy enough place for a snooze . Hop to now , me young bucks ! Hurry up and we 'll be on our way ! "  | " Good-bye , Nat , " Willis said , starting across the road . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched as the man spread the paper which Abraham had given me against the footboard beneath my legs and scratched something across it with a stubby quill , humming to himself in a breathy , hoarse voice the same tune he had just let loose from his watch . " Todd , " he whispered , " Jim , Shadrach , Willis .. . There , boy , " he added finally , " You take that receipt back to your master , and mind that you do n't lose your way . Go home straight away , do you hear me ? Good night , lad-die . " ' Good night , massah , " I said . I watched him cross the log road and mount the wagon with slow and corpulent difficulty , seating himself next to the other white man , a shaggy blur in the moonlight , who tapped all four mules into an ambling start , then gave the hindmost mule a sharp and savage stroke with his whip , causing the wagon to sway out of the ditch , groaning as it picked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a precarious lopsidedangle above the log road and with a great noise like the collision of countless barrels gained a final momentum , the uproar diminishing as the white shape passed westward through the moon 's relentless glare and out of sight . The Vaughans ' ai n't west , I thought . The Vaughans ' place is east . I sat there without moving . One of my mules stamped wearily , setting the traces to jingling . Around me in the woods the sound of frogs was deafening , shrilling in a ceaselessinsensate choir like wind through a million reeds . Almost imperceptibly the moon sank slowly behind a thicket of cypresstrees , and the log road was shadowed in a tangle of bent silhouetted limbs and branches , black as human arms . From the south a gentle breeze sprang up and I heard a whisperingand a stirring across the leafly roof of the forest . " Lord ? " I said aloud.  |p216Still  I listened to the soft and sibilant rustling among the moonlit treetops , and I held my breath as if waiting for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I called again . But as I sat listening the wind died , and along with it the whispering and rustling , the unspoken voice , and the night once again was enveloped in a shrilling of frogs , the ripe hot chirruping of katydids among the trees . I must have waited there for an hour or more . Then slowly I started back  --  with an emptiness such as I had never felt before  --  knowing that I did not have to read the paper in my hand to make me sure of what I already knew , thinking miserably , fiercely : Willis . And those boys ! Gone , Lord . Plain gone for good ! Listen , Lord . Not hired out , not Vaughan 's , not anything but that man with the watch who was nothing but a nigger trader . Simple as that , yes , Lord ! Not hired out but Jesus Christ Almighty sold . . . Sold , Lord , sold ! And he was saying : " One might think I was a blockhead not to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarding me so accusingly . But though I will take the blame for poor management of an already bungled transaction , I will have to still steadfastly defend myself from any charge of insensibility . For is that not what you find me guilty of ? " " I do n't understand what that word means , " I said . " The charge of  --  something . " " The charge of insensibility . The charge that I somehow blithely allowed you to arrange to take the boy to a camp meeting while fully aware that he was to be sold before you ever got to Jerusalem . Which brings me to another matter that I should mention in passing . And that is the camp meetingitself . I was in Jerusalem that Friday , which as you may remember was the first day of the revival . I believe I counted no more than twenty-four of the faithful , not including severalstray cats and dogs , at the meeting grounds . Theyp217packed up and left the next day , and had you gone there with your wagonload of wild-eyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of grass . Which only goes to show that this benighted countryside can not sustain a religious revivalany more than it can feed itself . So I mention in passing that I saved you from a bad disappointment . But as for the lad in question , I must only repeat that I had no more idea that you were taking him to that camp meeting than I had knowledge that the two of you were what you describe as inseparable friends . Lacking eyes in the back of my head , or a seventh sense , I can scarcely be asked to mark the relationshipbetween every human being among the eighty or so of all colors that exist on this property . And I think it was a great Frenchman , Voltaire , who said that the beginning of wisdom is the moment when one understands how little concerned with one 's own life are other men , they who are so desperately preoccupied with their own . I knew nothing about you and that boy , nothing at all . " I remained silent , wetting my lips with my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ library floor . " I have told you more than once now that had you come to me the next day and stated your case  --  had you made yourself immediately clear instead of for two weeks casting me these looks of canine reproach  --  I should have taken steps to get the boy back , buy him back even though that might mean money and travel to an extent quite out of the ordinary . But I must try to convince you that surely by now he has passed through the Petersburg market  --  though even of the place I can not be really certain , it may be that he was taken to a sale in Carolina  --  whatever , that he has been passed on into some buyer 's hands and must now be on the way to Georgiaor Alabama , though one can hope that a kindly providencehas seen fit that he somehow remain in Virginia . This , however , I sincerely doubt . The fact remains that he would now seem to be all but irrecoverable . I am in no way blaming you for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I may have been able to do something about it . I am only asking you now to try to understand the impossibility of my position . Do you see what I mean ? " " Yes , " I said after a moment . " Yes , I do but  --  " " Yes , but again , " he interrupted , " you are still eaten up about that one thing that will not let you alone . Even though you say you told him of your own surprise , you are devoured by the terrible idea that the boy for the rest of his life will think that you were a party to , an accomplice in , his disposal . Am I correct in this ? Is n't that what you said you are unable to shake from your mind ? " " Yes , " I replied , " that 's right . " " Then what can I say ? Say that I too am sorry ? I 've said that over and over to you before . Perhaps he will think that , perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mind if you envisioned him thinking charitably of you  --  if indeed it occurs to him to think of you as being involved in his disposition at all  --  envisioned him thinking of you only as an unwitting and ignorant dupe in the whole transaction , which you were . But if he thinks otherwise , I can only repeat again and for the last time that I am sorry . There is nothing else that I can say . Understand again : I had no idea that Abraham would fall ill and that you would become the  --  the instrument by which those boys were delivered into  --  into other hands . " He halted then and looked at me , lapsing into silence . " But  --  " I began slowly , " but I  --  " " But what ? " " All right , " I went on , " I see pretty well , I guess , about Willis , you did n't know about him and I. How I was teaching him and all . But this other thing I do n't understand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking they was going to be hired out at the Vaughans ' . " I paused . " I mean , everyone was going to know what really happened anyway , by and by . Or not by and by . Soon . " He looked away from me and when he spoke at last hisp219voice was faint and faraway ; suddenly I realized how weary he seemed , how gaunt were his cheeks and how red-rimmed and vacant were his eyes . " I will be truthful with you . I was quite simply troubled  --  afraid . I got confused , lost my bearings . Only twice do I recall darkies ever being sold away from here  --  both times by my father , both of the darkies , I 'm afraid , crazy people who were a threat to the community . Furthermore and aside from that , there has never until now been any need . So I had never sold off hands before , and as I have readily admitted , it was a bungled transaction . I had not wanted the word to get around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would ensue once the darkies knew that some of the people were being sold . So in my confusion I conceived the idea of disposing of the first four under the cover of night and in the guise of a fortnight 's hire to Major Vaughan . I thought that somehow the shock would be less this way , that it would be easier for the place to become accustomed to their absence . Worst of all , I conspired with a trader . It was folly to expect anything to come of this method . It was deviousand cowardly . The duplicity ! The masquerade ! I should have done it in broad daylight with all the plantation as gaping onlookers to a plain and simple sale , with money changing hands in full view . Of the entire proceedings the only redeeming feature may be that at least I tried to make certain that my first sale would involve no separation of families . It was unfortunate for you , perhaps imponderably unfortunatefor your young friend , that my resolve to pick only boys who were old enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orphaned and who thus had no family ties to sever  --  well , it was unfortunate that he was one of four who answered to that description . " He halted again , remaining silent , then said in a faint voice : " I 'm sorry . God , how sorry I am , that Willie . . . " " Willis , " I said . " And so you just had to sell them . There just was n't any other way . " His back was to me now , he stood facing the great highp220window open to the spring garden , and his voice , dim enough at the outset , was barely audible and I had to strain to hear it , as if it belonged to someone so infirm and depleted , or so lacking in spirit or hope , that whether the words could be understood was at last a matter of indifference . He went on as if he had n't heard me . " Well , soon all of them will be gone  --  everything  --  not just the land now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wagons and the pigs and the oxen and the mules but the men too , the white men and the women and the black boys  --  the Willies and the Jims and the Shadrachs and the Todds  --  all gone south , leaving Virginia to the thorn bushes and the dandelions . And all this we see here will be gone too , and the mill wheel will crumble away and the wind will whistle at night through these deserted halls . Mark my word . It is coming soon . " He paused , then said : " Yes , I had to sell those boys because I needed the money . Because anything non-human I had to sell was unsellable . Because those boys were worth over a thousand dollars and only through their sale could I begin to make the slightest inroad upon those debts I have accumulated for seven years  --  seven years during which I have lied to myself night and day in an effort to believe that what I saw around me was an illusion , that this mutilated and broken Tidewater would survive in spite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the soil , no matter how many men and chattel began to move south to Georgia and Alabama , Turner 's Mill would forever be here grinding out timber and meal . But now it is timber and meal for ghosts . " He ceased speaking for a moment , then again the weary voice resumed : " What should I have done instead ? Set them free ? What a ghastly joke ! No , they had to be sold , and the rest of them will be sold too , and soon Turner 's Mill will stand a dead hulk like the others on the landscape , and somewhere in the far South people may remember it but it will be remem/bered as if it were the fragment of a dream . " For a long time now he fell silent and then finally he said ( or I think he spoke my name , I was straining so hard to hear ) , " Nat . . . " And when he spoke again , his voice was the barest murmur as if whispering from the far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I sold them out of the desperation to hang on pointlessly a few years longer . " He made an abrupt gesture with his lifted arm , and it seemed that he passed his hand in a quick angry motion across his eyes . " Surely mankindhas yet to be born . Surely this is true ! For only somethingblind and uncomprehending could exist in such a mean conjunction with its own flesh , its own kind . How else account for such faltering , clumsy , hateful cruelty ? Even the possums and the skunks know better ! Even the weasels and the meadow mice have a natural regard for their own blood and kin . Only the insects are low enough to do the low things that people do  --  like those ants that swarm on poplars in the summertime , greedily husbanding little green aphids for the honeydew they secrete . Yes , it could be that mankind has yet to be born . Ah , what bitter tears God must weep at the sight of the things that men do to other men ! " He broke off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his voice a suddencry : " In the name of money ! Money ! " He became silent and I stood waiting for him to continue , but he said nothing , turned with his back toward me in the dusk . Afar and high above I heard Miss Nell call out : " Sam ! Samuel ! Is there anything wrong ? " Yet again for a long while he made no sign , no motion , so at last I moved quietly toward the door and left the room . Three years after this episode ( and a galloping swift three years they seemed to me )  --  a month before my twenty-first birthday and at just about the time I had originally been destined to start my life anew in Richmond  --  I was removed from Marse Samuel 's purview and passed into the temporaryp222custody of , or fell under the protection of , or was rented out to , or was borrowed by , a Baptist preacher named the ReverendAlexander Eppes , pastor to an impoverished flock of farmers and small tradesmen living in a district called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mill . For a long time I was never quite clear as to the relationship between me and the Reverend Eppes . Yet , one thing is certain , and this is that I was not " sold , " in the unadorned , mercenary sense of the word . The other Negroes at Turner 's Mill might be sold  --  and sold they were , with depressing regularity  --  but the notionthat I could be disposed of in this way was , up to and including the moment when I passed into the hands of the Reverend Eppes , quite inconceivable . Thus for the next three years , aware though I might have been of the uncertainty of the future that lay before me , I never thought once that Marse Samuel would not still ensure my freedom in Richmondas he had so eagerly promised  --  and I kept up this sunny optimism and complacency even as I watched Turner 's Mill and all of its land and its people and its chattel and its livestock disintegrate before my eyes like one of those river islands at flood time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its drenched and huddled ragtag occupants , coons and rabbits and blacksnakes and foxes , into the merciless brown waters . The Negroes  --  because they were by far the most valuableof the property , because at anywhere between four hundred and six hundred dollars apiece they represented the only safe , solid capital which Marse Samuel could liquidate in order to meet his creditors ' incessant demands ( the creditors too were packing up and leaving the Tidewater , hence an urgency in their claims )  --  the Negroes began to be sent off at a steady rate , in twos and threes or singly , a family here , another there , though often months might go by without a sale . All at once would appear a man in a gig , a gentleman with white side whiskers and a thick gold watch chain ,  |p223stam|ping  the mud from his mirror-bright boots . In the library I would serve biscuits and port from a silver tray , listening to Marse Samuel 's voice wan and weary in the summer dusk : " It is the traders who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will generally pay more means nothing to me . They are unscrupulous , sir , and would think nothing of separatinga mother from her only child . That is why , helpless as I am in this dreadful situation , I can at least insist upon dealing with a gentleman ... Yes , with one bad exception , so far all my sales have been with gentlemen like yourself .. . You are from the York County Fitzhughs , you say ? Then you must be a cousin of Thaddeus Fitzhugh , a classmate of mine at William &; Mary . . . Yes , the last lot of people I sold was to a gentleman heading west to the Boonslick country , I believe , in Missouri ; I sold him a family of five . . . A most humane and learned gentleman from Nottoway he was .. . You are favored by the gods , sir as you must know , to have a mill situated near a city like Richmond , free of the burden , the curse of land . . . I do not know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short for me here . Perhaps I shall go to Kentucky or Missouri too , though I have heard of interesting prospects in Alabama . . . Come now , I will show you George and Peter , the best mill hands I have left , you may be sure that they are uncommonly likely Negroes . . . Only a few of my darkies will have been fortunate enough to remain in Virginia ... " So George and Peter would go , or Sam and Andrew , or Lucy and her two young boys , packed off in a wagon which I myself would often drive to deliver them in Jerusalem , and always I was haunted and perplexed by the docile equanimityand good cheer with which these simple black people , irrevocably uprooted , would set out to encounter a strange and unknown destiny . Although they might cast backward what appeared to be the faintest glimmer of a wistful glance , this final parting from a place which had been their entire universe for years caused them no more regret than did thep224future cast over them worry or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stars , or as near as the next plantation , it was all the same to them , and with despair I marked how seldom they seemed to bother even bidding farewell to their friends . Only the rupture of some family tie I felt could grieve them , and such calamities did not happen here . Twittering and giggling , they mounted the wagon poised to carry them to an impossible fate at the uttermost ends of the earth , and they could speak only of an aching knee , the potency of a hairball from a mule 's stomach as a charm against witches , the proper way to train a dog to tree a possum , and mumble incessantly about eating . Slumbrous in broad daylight , they would flop asleep against the side boards of the wagon , pink lips wet and apart , nodding off into oblivion even before they had been taken beyond the gate , even before they were carried past the bounds of that land which had composed the entire smell and substance and geography of their lives and whose fields and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unseenand unremarked , forever . They cared nothing about where they came from or where they were going , and so snored loudly or , abruptly waking , skylarked about , laughing and slapping each other , and trying to clutch at the passing overhead leaves . Like animals they relinquished the past with as much dumb composure as they accepted the present , and were unaware of any future at all . Such creatures deservedto be sold , I thought bitterly , and I was torn between detestation for them and regret that it was too late for me to save them through the power of the Word . And so at last an alien quietude and stillness settled over the plantation , a hush so profound that it was in itself like the echo or reverberation of a faint remembered sound upon the ear . Finally it was not alone the Negroes who were disposed of but all the rest  --  the mules and the horses and the pigs , the wagons and the farming implements and the tools , saws andp225spinning wheels and anvils and house furniture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hammers , all and anything movable or unhingeable and detachable and worth more than half a dollar . And the absence of these things left a silence astonishing and complete . The great mill wheel , its last revolution accomplished , lay idle on its oaken shaft bedecked with dried mattings of greenish pond weed and grass , motionless now , the deep-throated steady grumble and roar as much a memory as those other diurnal sounds , far more faint yet persistent , that had echoed in all weathers season after season from dawn till dusk : the chink-chinking of hoes in the distant cornfields , sheep bleating on the lawn and a Negro 's sudden rich laughter , an anvil banging in the blacksmith 's shop , a snatch of song from one of the remotest cabins , the faint crashing in the woods of a felled tree , a stirring within the big house , a fidget and a buzz , a soft musicalmurmuration . Slowly these sounds diminished , faded , became still altogether , and the fields and rutted roadways lay as starkly deserted as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cornfields and the meadows ; sills , frames , and doors fell apart in the empty outbuildings . At night , where once glowing hearths lit each cabin down the slope , now all lay in suffocating dark like the departure of the campfires of some army on the plains of Israel . As I have already said , Marse Samuel soon found that it was not possible for me to be delivered to that Mr. Pembertonin Richmond on my twenty-first birthday as he had hoped . Through the solemn moments of one evening after supper he explained to me how the depression which afflicted the Tidewater had washed over the city too , and how the market for such clever labor as I might provide had severely diminished  --  indeed was " busted , " as the saying goes . Thus my master was faced with a troublesome dilemma . He could not on the one hand simply set me free without a period of " seasoning " in the hands of a responsible person : all too manyp226young Negroes , given their freedom without sponsorship , without some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their papers stolen , bumping about in a daze as the wagon wheels rumbling underneath their cracked skulls bore them south to the fields of cotton . At the same time to take me with him to Alabama ( that is where , almost at the last moment , he decided to try the remnants of his luck ) would altogether defeat his plans for me , since opportunities for the rich life of a free Negro craftsman were almost nonexistentdown in those townless river-bottom swamps and stews . So finally Marse Samuel had decided upon a provisionalcourse , entrusting my body to the good Christian shepherd of whom I have spoken , the Reverend Eppes  --  this devoted and pious gentleman who could be expected to complete the documents in regard to my freedom as soon as the times got better up in Richmond ( as they surely would ) and who as recompense for his compassion and his overseeing of my destiny would receive the fruits of my labor for a while , gratis . And so there came a September morning , hot and throbbingwith the sound of locusts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I told him we were leaving this morning , " he said to me , " so the Reverend Eppes should be here to fetch you sometime around noon , maybe before . As I have told you before , Nat , you need have nothing to worry about . Although a Baptist , the Reverend Eppes is a gentleman of great probity and kindliness and will treat you in exactly the manner I would wish . You will find him a man of simplicity , and of modest resources , but he will be good to you . I shall be in touch with him by post from Alabama , and I shall be in touch with my own representatives in Richmond . And thus after a year or so , no more , the Reverend Eppes will arrange for your apprenticeship in Richmond and your eventual emancipation in just the same way I would have done had I been here . It is allp227written up in the agreement we made in Jerusalem and its legality is unquestioned . More important , though , Nat , is the trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for all your needs , physical and spiritual . He is truly a gentleman of humanity and honor . " We stood in the shade of a great sycamore tree ; the day was sultry , breathless , the air close and damp like a warm mouth-enveloping hand . The four wagons with which Marse Samuel would make the long trip were ready , waiting , the mules stamping and stirring in their traces . The rest of the family  --  the older nephew and his wife , Miss Emmeline , Benjamin'swidow , Miss Nell  --  had gone away already ; they had stopped down in Raleigh with cousins or ( in the case of the older ladies ) had begun a sojourn in Petersburg , from whence Marse Samuel would summon them once all was safely established on Alabama soil . Of the Negroes , only Prissy and Little Morning and Abraham and his family were left ; house Negroes , they had memories of happy times , and they wept loudly , the mourning lot crammed into one wagon . In tears I had said good-bye to them all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embrace and , at last , takingLittle Morning 's cold old-leathery feeble hand and pressingit to my lips ; hair white as frost now , palsied and totally gone in the head , he lay propped sightless and uncomprehendingat the rear of the wagon , heading south at his life 's withered and weary end from the only home he had ever known . The mules stirred and stamped in their traces . Try as I might , I seemed unable to stifle my grief . " You must n't take on so , Nat , " Marse Samuel said , " it is not like a death , it is like a new life for all of us . We shall always be in touch by the post . And you  --  " He paused for an instant , and I knew that he too was moved . " And you  --  you , Nat  --  think of the freedom that you will have , after all ! Keep that in mind always and the sorrow of this parting will fade in your memory . The future is all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then , as if struggling to choke back his own feelings , began to say all sorts of commonplacethings in a forced voice touched with false cheeriness : " Come now , Nat , chin high ! . . . The receiver of the land , Judge Bowers in Jerusalem , is sending around a man who will remain here as the custodian and he might even be here today . . . Meanwhile , Prissy has left noontime dinner for you in the kitchen . . . Chin high , Nat , chin high always and good-bye ! . . . Good-bye ! . . . Good-bye ! " He embraced me awkwardly , swiftly . I felt his whiskers against my cheek , and heard Abraham 's bullwhip crack far ahead like a musket . Then he turned about and was gone , and the wagons were gone , and it is the last I ever saw of him . I stood in the lane until the final echo of the wheels vanishedrattling in the distance . My desolation was complete . As sundered from my root and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was adrift between that which was past and those things yet to come . Great boiling clouds hung on the far horizon . For a long moment I felt myself like Jonah cast into the deep , in the midst of the seas , with floods compassingme about and all God 's billows and waves passing over me . And now I began to look forward to the coming of the Reverend Eppes , but it took an almighty long time for him to fetch me . All morning I sat on the steps of the bare veranda , stripped of its furniture , waiting for the clergyman to arrive , awaiting the sound of hoofbeats , the rattle of some conveyancecoming up the lane . It was hot and muggy and a moist haze with a hint of storm about it blurred the greenish sky ; by late morning the sun burned down through murky waves of heat , so oppressive that even the locusts became still and the birds retreated , silent , to the leafy blue sanctuary of the woods . For two or three hours I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( My Bible was the only possessionI had to take away from Turner 's Mill save for these things : a single change of denim pants , two cotton shirts , an extra pair of what are elegantly known as nigger brogans , some little bone crosses I had carved , a needle and some thread , a pewter cup left to me by my mother , and a tendollargold piece which Marse Samuel had given me the day before . It was a matter of custom that the person into whose hands I was delivered would supply the rest of my needs . The gold piece I had sewn into the belt band of my pants , and I kept everything wrapped in a large blue bandanna . ) It seemed appropriate to the moment , suspended as I was between two existences , troubled by abandonment and loss , heartsick at the void I felt upon the departure of all the dearest and best friends I had ever known , yet at the same time obscurely excited by the promise of a new world , liberty , the fruition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past of myself a freedman jauntily striding toward church or job down some Richmond boulevard  --  it seemed appropriate to this mingled mood , as I say , that I study a Psalm in which sorrow and exaltation were joined , and I recollectthat it was Psalm 90 that I put to memory that morning , the one beginning , Lord , thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations , and which contains the verse that goes : A thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is past , and as a watch in the night .. . Noon came and went , the coppery sun sank toward the afternoon : still no Reverend Eppes , and I was hungry . I rememberedthen ( having in my absorption forgotten ) the meal waiting for me , and so with my sack thrown over my shoulder I walked back through the bare , deserted halls to the kitchen . There on a shelf over the great brick hearth was the last meal ever to be served here to a Turner : four pieces of fried chicken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a cracked mug  --  decent big-house food , proper for a fare/well repast , thoughtfully covered by a worn clean flour sack as a screen against flies . That I recall with great clarity such small details may have something to do with the overall sense of ominousness , the spidery disquietude and perplexity which , like the shadows of vines creeping up a stone wall in descending sunlight , began to finger my spine as I sat on the window sill in the empty kitchen eating that chicken and bread . The stillness of the plantation was at this instant almostcomplete , so oppressive and strange that I suddenly thought , jittery with a vague terror , that I had been stricken by deafness . I ceased eating for a moment , both ears cocked and straining , waiting for some sound outside  --  a bird call , the plashing of a duck on the millpond , a whisper of wind in the forest  --  to convince me that I could hear , but I heard nothing , nothing at all , and my panic swelled until just then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roughly on the pine floor reassured me : I chided myself for my silliness and continued eating , and was further soothed by a fly 's insensate deafening mutter as it settled on the topmost edge of my ear . But the feeling of an ominous hush and solitude would not leave me alone , would not fade away , clung to me like some enveloping garment which , try as I might , I could not ease from my shoulders . I tossed the chicken bones down into the weed-choked flower bed below the kitchen window , and wrapping the remains of the bread carefully in my sack along with the broken mug  --  I thought it would become of use somehow  --  ventured out into the great hall of the house . Dismantled of everything that could be moved  --  of crystal chandeliers and grandfather 's clock , carpets and piano and sideboard and chairs  --  the cavernous room echoed with a tomblike roar to my sudden sneeze . The reverberation smashed from wall to wall with the sound of waterfalls , cataracts , then became silent . Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with age , embedded immovablyp231between two upright columns against the wall , remained as sure proof of past habitation ; its blurred and liquid depths reflected the far side of the hall , and there four immaculate rectangles marked the vanished portraits of Turner forebears ; two stem gentlemen in white wigs and cocked hats , two serene ladies with modest bosoms bedecked in ribbons and flounces of pink satin , they had been nameless to me yet over the years as familiar as kin : their absence was suddenly shocking , like swift multiple deaths . I went back out on the veranda , again waiting for the sound of hooves and wheels , and again there was only silence . Even then I had begun to feel that I was alone , abandoned , forgotten , and that no one was going to come and fetch me ; the sensation caused me fear and foreboding but part of the emotion was not unpleasant , and way down inside I felt my bowels stirring with a mysterious , queasy , voluptuousthrill . I had never felt this way before and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my sack down on the veranda steps and strolling to the small promontory at the side of the house , where in almost one glance it was possible to survey the entireprospect of abandoned dwellings , decaying shops and sheds and runined land  --  an empire devastated by the hordes of Gideon . The heat had become wicked , unrelenting , pouringdown from a smudged , greasy sky in which the sun pulsatedlike a faint pink coal through the haze . As far as my eye could reach , the cabins lay in weatherworn rows to the vast bottom cornfield , now a majestic jungle of weeds , sunflowers , and impenetrable green bramble . The sense of excitement , gut-deep , warm , squirmy , returned irresistibly as I watched the scene , as my eyes lingered on the ranks of empty cabins then returned to regard the shops close by , the outhouses and stables and sheds , and the big house looming near , unpeopled and silent in the terrible heat . Only a dripping of water through the cracked millpond dam disturbed the silence now  --  only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the weeds . I tried to force back the sharp and growing excitementbut even as I did so I felt my pulse pounding and the sweat flowing beneath my arms in streams . There was no wind , the trees in the surrounding woods were quiet ; yet becauseof this very stillness they seemed a solid mass stretchingout on all sides of me in perfect circumference to the last boundaries of the world , an all-pervading triumphant mass of greenery . Nothing but this still and mined plantation existed ; it was the very heart of the universe and I was the master not alone of its being at the present instant but of all its past and hence all its memories . Solitary and sovereign as I gazed down upon this wrecked backwater of time , I suddenly felt myself its possessor ; in a twinkling I became white  --  white as clabber cheese , white , stark white , white as a marble Episcopalian . I turned about and moved to the very crest of the slope , hard by the circular drive where carriages had come and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughingly dismounted upon carpeted footboards , their petticoatsspilling on the air like snow as I steadied their outstretchedarms . Now , looking down at the shops and barns and cabins and distant fields , I was no longer the grinning black boy in velvet pantaloons ; for a fleeting moment instead I owned all , and so exercised the privilege of ownership by unlacing my fly and pissing loudly on the same worn stone where dainty tiptoeing feet had gained the veranda steps a short three years before . What a strange , demented ecstasy ! How white I was ! What wicked joy ! But my blackness immediately returned , the fantasy dissolved , and I was again overtaken by wrenching loneliness and a pang of guilt . The Reverend Eppes did not appear , though I strained my ears for the sound of his approach on the road . I went back to my Bible once more , reading and committing to memory one of my favorite passages  --  the story of Samuel and the ark of the covenant  --  while afternoonp233lengthened and light dimmed on the veranda and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As it grew dark I knew that the Reverend Eppes would not arrive that day . I got hungry again and had a twitch of sharp discomfort when I realized that there was no more to eat . Then I remembered the shortening bread in my sack , and when night fell , I ate the rest of the loaf , washing it down with water from the cistern behind the kitchen . Inside the house it was as black as the swamp on a moonless night , clammy and stifling , and I stumbled aimlessly about while clouds of mosquitoes whined about my ears . My little bedroomhad been stripped bare like all the rest , and there was no use sleeping there , so I lay down on the floor in the great hall near the front door with my sack as a pillow beneath my head . Then along about what must have been eleven o'clock a storm descended on the plantation , scaring me out of wits and sleep ; titanic lightning bolts illumined the dark , in flashes of eerie green outlined the deserted mill and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water in windy sheets and torrents . Cracklings of thunder rent the heavens , and a single shaft of lightning suddenly broke in two a huge old magnolia nearby in the woods , toppling half the behemothto earth with a squealing and a groaning like a stricken madman . The night filled me with terror , I had never known such a storm , never in my life ; it seemed a special storm ordained by God , and I hid my head between my sack and the bare planks of the floor , wishing that I had never been born . At last the storm slackened , dwindled away with a soft dripping noise and I raised my head up , recollecting the flood : The fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped , and the rain from heaven was restrained . . . I whispered thanks to the Lord in a prayer , and finally went off to sleep , listening to the wet sound of an owl , blown in by the storm , as it stirred and shivered somewherep234high on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hootoo , hoot-oo . Then I heard a voice  --  " Git on up , boy "  --  and I awoke in a dazzle of morning light to see and feel the toe of a black boot prodding me awake  --  not a gentle prod , either , but an insistentsharp boring-in between my ribs which caused me to gasp and rise instantly onto my elbows , gulping morning air as if I had been half drowned . " You Nat ? " I heard the man say . Even as he spoke I knew it was the Reverend Eppes . He was clad from head to toe in clerical black ; motheaten black preacher 's leggings he wore too , level with my eyes now , and I saw that several buttons were missing and for some reason the gaiters exuded , or seemed to exude , a sour , worn , unclean smell . My eyes traveledup the length of his long black-clad shanks and his seedy black mohair frock coat and lingered for the barest instant on the face , which had a skinny , big-nosed , pentecostal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; bespectacledwith oval wire-framed glasses , belonging to a man of about sixty , redly wattled in the neck like a turkey gobbler 's , bitter of countenance and opaque of eye , it was a face graven with poverty , sanctimony , and despair , and both my heart and my belly suddenly shriveled within me . If nothing else , I knew I had had my last piece of white bread for some time to come . " You Nat ? " he said again , more insistent now . It was a barren and suspicious voice , nasal , full of cold November winds , and something in it warned me that with this clergymanit would not do to display any educated airs . I scrambled to my feet and retrieved my sack from the floor and said : " Yas , massah , das right . I'se Nat . " " Git on in that buggy down ' ere , " he ordered . The buggy was at the veranda steps , drawn by the most pathetic sway-backed old spotted mare I had ever seen . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thep235sunlight for half an hour or more , watching the sad old nag switch her tail against a hide covered with sores upon which flies supped greedily and listening to the muffled commotion made by the Reverend Eppes as he stamped about in the far recesses of the house . Finally he returned and climbed up on the seat beside me , bearing with him two huge iron pothooks ( I had thought it impossible that the house could yield anything else to a scavenger ) which he had managed to yank with his great raw-knuckled fists out of the solid oak of a kitchen wall . " Gee-yup , Beauty , " he said to the horse , and before I knew it we had gone down the lane beneath the trees shrill with locusts , and Turner 's Mill , abandoned to the beetlesand the meadow mice and the owls , was out of my life forever . We must have traveled several miles up the wagon trace before the Reverend Eppes spoke again . During this part of the journey , the sorrow and the sense of dislocation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which had tormented me ever since I had been left alone the day before  --  was obscured by the pure fact of hunger in my stomach , and I thought longingly of yesterday 's chicken , and felt my insides painfully rumbling , all the while hoping that if the Reverend Eppes opened his lips to utter a thought it would be a thought concerning the question of food . But this was not to be . " How old you be , boy ? " he said . " I'se twenty , massah , " I replied , " twenty-one come de first day October . " It is good for a Negro , when trying to ingratiate himself with a strange white man , to convey an impression of earnest simplicity and this may often be achieved by adding to such a reply as mine some phrase like " Das de truth , " or " Das right . " I think that I must have tacked on then a sweet and open " Das de truth , " and by so doing made the mistake of arousing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my innocence.  | " You ever git any of them little nigger girls in the bushes ? " he said . A funky stale smell seemed to pour from his threadbare clothes , an odor of grease and soil and deep poverty ; I wanted to avert my nose but dared not . There was something abut the man that filled me with an uneasiness verging on dread . Dismayed by his question , I felt myself honestly unable to answer and tried to let myself off the dilemma in typical nigger fashion by a slow soft giggle and a great mouthful of inarticulate syllables . " Aa ! Leh  --  Haw ! " " Mr. Turner done told me you religious-minded , " he said . " Yassuh , " I replied , hoping that religion would work to my advantage somehow . " So you religious-minded , " he went on . He had a dry barrenvoice , monotonously reedy and harsh , like the crepitation of a cricket in the weeds . It seemed impossible that such a voice could ever exhort people to anything . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what King Solomonson of David said about women , ' specially whores . He said a whore is a deep ditch , and a strange woman is a narrow pit . She also lieth in wait as for a prey , and increaseth the transgressors among men . That right , boy ? " " Yassuh , " I said . " He said by means of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece of bread , and the adulteress will hunt for the preciouslife . That right , boy ? He said keep thee from the evil woman , from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman . Lust not after her beauty in thine heart , neither let her take thee with her eyelids . You know that 's right , boy . " " Das right , " I replied , " yassuh , I ' spect das right . " We had not looked at each other ; I sensed rather his wintry and eaten face next to mine , gazing despairingly straight ahead , and I smelled the sour , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as dry as sand . " But a young man , " he said , " now that 's a different idea . Ap237young man is beauty and sweetness . He said eat thou honey , because it is good , and the honeycomb which is sweet to thy taste . Eat thou honey . That right , boy ? He said the glory of young men is their strength and the beauty of old men is the gray head . He said when thou liest down thou shalt not be afraid , yea , thou shalt lie down . Yes , boy ? Hope deferred maketh the heart sick but when the desire cometh , it is a tree of life . The true root and the tree of life , praise God . " " Yassuh , " I sighed wretchedly . We rode for a long time in silence . We had taken a side turning off the trace and passed now through country I had never seen before . It was poor , eroded land with weedchokedred-clay fields bare of habitation . Scraggly pine groves stretched across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turkey buzzards swooped and wheeled , touching me with gloom and with visions of bleached skeletons , decayed flesh , and slow suffering deaths . A smoky haze hung over the land , and crows cried dismally from afar . It was as if all the people had suddenly vanished from the earth . " Tell me something , boy , " he said finally , the reedy voice suddenly strained , hesitant yet fraught with some terrible decision . " I hear tell a nigger boy 's got an unusual big pecker on him . That right , boy ? " I became feeble with anxiety and could make no reply . The buggy had stopped and we rested in the shade of a spindly old oak , half dead in a shroud of leaves prematurely yellowing and withering , the great hulk of its trunk smotheredin the green fecund moist embrace of honeysuckle and Virginia creeper . Dizzy with apprehension , I kept my eyes fixed toward my feet . A fragrance of honeysuckle mingled with the presence now of the Reverend Eppes ; he was sweatingin streams , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneath his black shiny cuff and onto the back of the great ungainly sun-blistered hand which now tensely clutched his knee.  | " You know what I hear tell , boy ? " he went on , placing the same tight and tormented hand on the fleshy part of my upper leg . His voice trembled , his old ugly red fingers trembled , and I too felt myself trembling inwardly as I made a silent , urgent plea to the heavens : Lord ? Are you there , Lord ? A cloud passed over the day then , and a sudden breath of coolness came , borne as if on the air freshening in the treetops ; now with a leafy tremor the coolness fled , light blossomedblindingly , and the stench of the Reverend Eppes once more was sour and close . " I hear tell your average nigger boy 's got a member on him inch or so longer'n ordinary . That right , boy ? " I remained as silent as the space within a tomb , feeling the quivering fingers on my thigh . When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a long moment he squeezed down remorselessly on my flesh and whispered : " You goin ' to mind me , boy ? " But this time when I failed to answer , he removed his hand from my leg and we started off anew , squeaking dustily along northward through the sullen and woebegone countryside . Perhaps half an hour passed before he spoke again , and his dry ageless cricket 's voice was filled with despair and hatred and love and misery and retribution as he said : " You better mind me ! You jest better mind me , that 's all , you hear ! " Time grows brief in this chronicle of my early years . My residence with the Reverend Eppes was short-lived . There remains need to tell only of the way in which the Reverend Eppes 's stewardship of my fortunes led me not toward that freedom I had for so long anticipated as a natural consequence of the transfer of my person into his custody , but toward something entirely and surprisingly different . It had been Marse Samuel 's intention , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while in the service of the minister.  |p239However  , it turned out that I worked there for less time than Marse Samuel must even have imagined . As you have doubtlessseen , one of Marse Samuel 's characteristics was a fetchingingenuousness and faith in human nature ; being a poor judge of people anyway , it was especially unfortunate that abstaining as he did from formal religious observance , he should still retain a traditional respect for and trust in the goodness of the clergy . This trust was a central mistake . I think that in handing me over to the Reverend Eppes he envisioned a charming , benign , and mutually satisfying relationshipbetween an adorable old bachelor preacher and his black acolyte  --  already " religious-minded " and learned in the Scripture  --  the two of us dwelling in perfect Christian concordas I celebrated with honest labor the spiritual harvest that his age and wisdom might shower upon me . What a splendid vision . What tender dreams of charity one hopes blessed my late master 's slumber amid the balmy Alabama night ! Well , old Eppes ceased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the few tolerable aspects of my stay ) fairly early on , so that by the time autumn arrived I was free at least of that worry , which for a spell had been a burdensome one . There had been a few days after my arrival at Shiloh when he had ambushed me in the sagging , pestilential two-hole outhouse which served both his own pitiful dwelling and the church ; there , cosseting me loudly again with proverbs and other suasions from Holy Writ , he tried to break me down by the same route he had traveled on the day of our first encounter , his big old beak leaking the dew of frustration onto his upper lip and his voice a paradigm of anguish as he clutched at me amid the swarming flies . But one day he made a great and defeated shudder , and with wormwood in his mouth , abandonedthe quest , to my relief and puzzlement . Only much later , when I grew older and considerably more reflective , did it occur to me that his desire for me , intense as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally exceeded by his desire for my domination . Had he reached his lesser goal , had I submitted to his malodorous gropings , he would have gained a pet but lost a slave ; it is not easy totally to master someone you 've buggered behind the woodpile , and if I had become the compliant vessel of his cravings he might have found it much harder to run me until my legs felt like stumps . Which is what he did  --  eighteen and twenty hours a day , seven days a week , especially , I should add , on Sunday  --  and for the first time in my life I began to sense the world , the true world , in which a Negro moves and breathes . It was like being plunged into freezing water . Further , I soon realized that my predicament was made even more onerous by the fact that I was the only slave in Shiloh , a grim and pious little crossroads community of some thirty-five souls . Small farmers for the most part , scratching for life itself in arid patches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ castoffs from the same cataclysmic depression which had sent the more prosperous of their fellow citizens , like Marse Samuel , to the far South : failed overseers , onearmedtinkers , bankrupt country storekeepers , reformed drunks , God-maddened paralytics , they were a bleak and undone brotherhood of true believers with scarcely a dollar to divide among them and only the hope of the soul 's rescue through total immersion to preserve them and their goiterous women and pale , straw-haired , worm-infested children from absolute disintegration . As the only two-legged chattel in Shiloh , then , it befell my lot not only to do the chores for the Reverend Eppes  --  to chop kindling and haul spring water and feed Beauty , the sway-backed mare , and shell corn and slop the three pigs and build the morning fires , acting both as a sort of grotesque valet to the preacher in the shack he called a parsonage and as a sexton at the rickety church  --  but to be of service to the rest of the congregation as well . As I deviously learned , the goodp241pastor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I must have become , however briefly , the answer to a lifelong prayer is a fact which often touched me in later years ) , and in the first flush of enthusiasm over the bonanza that I represented , he obviously had a deep Christian urge to share me equally with the members of his flock . Thus all that fall and winter  --  one of the most frigid years within living memory  --  I found how swiftly the body loses its sap and the soul its optimism through having one 's energies split three dozen ways . It seemed to me that I had been plunged into a hallucinationin which I had parted from all familiar existence and was suddenly transformed into a different living creature altogether  --  half-man , half-mule , exhausted and without speech , given over to dumb and reasonless toil from the hours before dawn until the dead of night . In the tiny three-room parsonageI slept in what was called the kitchen , on a straw tick covered with rags near the back door .

He snored cavernously all night long , throbbing like a mill wheel through my restless dreams . Sometimes he would give a great strangled noise and wake up chattering disconnected words from the gospel . " I also am of Christ ! " he howled once , and another night I saw his white nightshirted shape lurch upright as he wailed : " Lewdness , 0 ye Jews ! " Even in the unbelievable cold the house was fetid and rank like a chicken pen in summer . Lord , what a time ! How I yearned for the days and months to pass and for the winter to end ; how I waited for the moment to come when I would be delivered from this pesthole , to Richmond and into freedom . But it became an endless and wicked season , with no relief in sight . Thrice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
