There in the clubhouse he sat , in his undershirt , a snaggle-toothed grin giving him the look of a Saint Bernard that had broken into its own brandy barrel . " It feels good , " murmured Manager Walter ( " Smokey " ) Alston of the Los Angeles Dodgers . " It always feels good to win . " <P> Smokey Alston smiling ? The Dodgers winning ? It was only yesterday that the collapsible Dodgers blew a four-game lead in the final week and presented the 1962 National League pennant to the San Francisco Giants . And it seemed only the day before that Bobby Thomson of the Giants deposited a dinky drive into the leftfield seats at the Polo Grounds to beat the Dodgers in a playoff for the 1951 pennant . Now the stage was set for another whirlwind finish that would leave the Dodgers flat on their backs , muttering dazedly : " Wait till next year . " <P> " Another Game . " All was in readiness last week when the Bums rolled into St. Louis for a last three-game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Dodgers were coasting six games ahead of the pack . But then the Cards won 19 out of 20 , and the Dodger lead dissolved to one slim game . For the first time in years , lines of fans stood all day outside Busch Stadium waiting for the ticket gates to open . " We 're ready , " promised Cardinal Manager Johnny Keane . As for Alston , he would only grunt : " Another game , another series . " <P> Back in Los Angeles , Dodger fans sighed and waited for the worst . In nine years , Alston had delivered three pennants , two world championships , eight first-division finishes . But this was a time for heroics , and Alston hardly seemed the man to ignite any team . He was still the dour , noncommittal ex-shop teacher from Darrtown , Ohio , the fellow who struck out the only time he ever got to bat in the big leagues , the homespun country boy who played percentages so devoutly that the Dodgers paid a fulltime statistician to do his arithmetic . Every fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find out how much the Dodgers were going to pay him ( currently : $45,000 ) - if indeed he was still on the payroll . " We all get fired sometime , " he shrugged . " The only question is when . " <P> But for once every percentage play clicked , and every move was blinding genius . To pitch the first game , Alston called on Veteran Lefthander Johnny Podres , bad back , so-so record ( 13 victories , 10 losses ) and all . The slugging Cards got only three hits ( including a home run by Stan Musial ) , and the Dodgers won , 3-1 . " We hated to lose that first game , " admitted Cardinal Manager Keane . Gritted Musial : " We 've got to win the next two . " <P> When the Cards looked out to the mound next day , there stood Sandy Koufax , No. 1 in the National League in won-lost record ( 23-5 ) , strikeouts ( 284 ) and practically everything else. * The Dodgers ' regular rotation called for Koufax to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hashana , and Sandy refuses to pitch on Jewish holidays . Alston also started hulking ( 6 ft. 7 in. , 250 Ibs . ) Frank Howard despite the fact that Howard was 0-for-19 in St. Louis this season . So naturally Howard crashed a two-run homer , and Koufax needed only 87 pitches , 66 of them strikes , to spin a nifty four-hitter for a 4-0 shutout , his eleventh of the year .
