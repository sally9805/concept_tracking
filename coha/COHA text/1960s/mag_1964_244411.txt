Like their less ambitious party colleagues , the busy Republican presidential hopefuls , after several weeks of higgledy-piggledy campaigning , final ly seemed to be zeroing in on President Johnson 's foreign policy , or the lack thereof . <P> <P> Tailoring his talk to the locale , Barry Goldwater told an audience of 400 in dice-shooting Reno , Nev. , that Johnson 's handling of foreign affairs reminded him of " a fellow that just crapped out six times in a row . " In New Hampshire , Nelson Rockefeller said the President " has shown a lack of ability to keep on top of the important things in foreign policy . " Richard Nixon said in Cincinnati that he found it hard " to name any place in the world where the U.S. is not being blackmailed , threatened , insulted or knocked around by some pip-squeak dictator . " Pennsylvania 's Governor William Scranton said foreign policy was becoming the No. 1 campaign issue in 1964 , urged the G.O.P. to " take advantage of this . " <P> " Less of a Menace . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose campaign to date has had all the zip of a snapped rubber band , left New Hampshire 's sub-zero climate for a region he finds more hospitable , the Far West . In Portland , he was greeted by an airport crowd of 300 sporting cowboy hats with the AuH.s0 symbol and signs inscribed , OUT WEST WE LIKE BARRY BEST , and he drew 5,000 with a speech at the city 's new Coliseum . Arriving in San Francisco , Goldwater told newsmen that the John Birch Soci ety 's latest attack on John F. Kennedy as a Communist dupe was " detestable , " but he refused to disavow Birchite support . " The John Birch Society is far less of a menace to the U.S. than the Americans for Democratic Action or the U.A.W. , " he said . " These are the people who advocate socialism . " Up on Nob Hill , Barry got an enthusiastic reception from 2,000 at the Commonwealth Club , and in Sacramento , he predicted that the winner of California 's June 2 primary " will be the Republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win in California-win big . " <P> Throughout the week Barry hit the theme of party unity , warning , " We ca n't afford the luxury of infighting . " He said that he and Rocky were actually closer on the issue of " welfarism " than such Democrats as , say , Wayne Morse and Harry Byrd . But that still left them mighty far apart , and Barry could not resist wisecracking that a race between Rockefeller and Johnson " would be a choice of Tweedledee and Tweedledum . " <P> Snowshoes &; Skis . Meanwhile , Rocky and Senator Margaret Chase Smith were stepping up their campaigns in New Hampshire . The lady from Maine rose with the sun , stomped around in a beaver-skin coat to shield her from temperatures that reached 29 below zero , donned snowshoes to clump around in the Canadian border town of Pittsburg ( pop . 200 ) . Annoyed that press reports invariably mention her age , she said that " Winston Churchill was three years older than I when he first became Prime Minister . " ( Actually , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also proved that she has energy enough for a pair of 33-year-olds , squeezing in two hours of campaigning before breakfast at 8:30 and making stops in places like Ellsworth , which has all of nine registered voters .
