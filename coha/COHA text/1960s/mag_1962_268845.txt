In Harlem 's Church of the Master this week , a preacher named Oscar Brown Jr . delivered a sermon in song-an elegy for castaways between a front-porch Heaven and a sidewalk Hell . It was his debut in the pulpit-but the message was scarcely new to him . He had delivered it just the night before , downtown at Manhattan 's smoky Blue Angel club . Mixing the groovy with the grave in songs that filled his life during a dozen mute years . Oscar Brown had at last found his voice . Matched with Brown 's stylish skill as a performer , it promises to introduce him as the best new entertainer since Belafonte . <P> A wounded knowledge of the " world full of grey " is the source of Brown 's idiom-a varied and appealing bouquet of jazz , folk music and the blues . He snaps from one mood to the next with commanding effect , leading his audience through the street scenes that echo in his music . With porkpie hat and elbows locked to his hips in the pose of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ king . The song ends with a spin , a pause , and Brown turns back to his listeners-a mask of pain that conjures up the setting for his next lament . In a minute he is downtown again , fingers snapping . <P> His lyrics caused Ebony to pronounce him " a hip Negro folk poet " Lorraine ( A Raisin in the Sun ) Hansberry calls him " a startling genius . " But the 150-odd songs he has written mostly dote on the city 's familiar figures , black and white alike , and on private themes of wonder and frailty . " Emotion has to be the heart of the song , " Brown says . " You make the people feel ; they make themselves think . " Expression of Hope . Ardent and boyish at 35 , Brown grew up on Chicago 's South Side . He attended three colleges without success , finally took a halfhearted fling at his father 's real estate business . He wrote Brown Baby , his best-known song , eleven years ago as an expression of hope for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then , without learning to read music , he was suddenly composing in earnest , humming his tunes to musician friends who copied them down . " I lose a little that way , " he says . " Only music , though . I can type . " <P> Oscar ran head-on into failure in Chicago last fall when his musical , Kicks &; Co. , a social fantasy built on a finger-snapping Mephistopheles called Mr. Kicks , collapsed after four performances . " Too factual . " observed the Chicago Defender . <P> " Inexperience is a drag . " said Oscar - and got to work again . Now deep into a second musical . Oscar writes all morning , sings most of the night . His voice has found only a rented room in the range it occupies , but he has such command over it that he can blithely abandon any melodic confines and sing out with a freedom possessed by no other jazz singer except Ray Charles . <P> God &; the Devil . Brown is an evangelist of the social gospel only . For Oscar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one 's honest try - both of them amiable enough figures in his life . But the accept ance of his music , the success of his record albums , the outlook for kicks in the future - all are too bright to take seriously . " The other day a burlesque girl came by my room and asked if she could sing Mr. Kicks in her act , " Oscar says .
