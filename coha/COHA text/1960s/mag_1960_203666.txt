Just when everything seems to be going his way , Nikita Khrushchev has a habit of overreaching himself . Now he has obliged over Cuba . Until he brandished his rockets and mouthed his threats , the quarrel between the U.S. and Cuba met with a disquieting passivity in Latin America . Though governments might know better , their people generally side with Castro . Then Khrushchev proclaimed that any attack on Cuba would bring instant retaliation against the U.S. by Soviet intercontinental missiles . The Monroe Doc trine , he said , is dead , and should be buried " so that it should not poison the air by its decay . " At this point , 17 Latin American nations dropped their apathetic neutrality to side with the U.S. in mutual concern over a Soviet incursion in Latin America . The unilateral Monroe Doctrine was not dead after all ; it has become the multilateral concern of the 21 members of the Organization of American States . <P> Oddly enough , it was a threat from Russia back in 1823 that led President James Monroe and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proclaim the original Monroe Doctrine , fencing off the hemisphere from European intervention . <P> Czar Alexander I , spreading his claims down the western coast of North America from the Bering Strait to Vancouver Is land , forbade all foreign ships to approach within " 100 Italian miles " of shore on pain of confiscation . The U.S. put the world on notice that " the American continents are henceforth not to be considered as subject for further colonization . " Further concerned that the " Holy Alliance " of Russia , Prussia and Austria might launch a war to restore newly liberated Latin American nations to the Spanish throne , Madison and Adams warned that the U.S. would view interference as the manifestation of an unfriendly disposition toward the U.S. <P> For a nation so young and still so weak , such a stand was courageous and decidedly overambitious . " These United States of America , " snorted Austria 's Prince Metternich , " have astonished Europe by a new act of revolt , more unprovoked , fully as audacious and no less dangerous than the former " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best little bit of paper that God had ever permitted any man to give to the world . " Intervention License . Teddy Roosevelt amended the Monroe Doctrine to mean that continued disturbance in a Latin American country could force the U.S. to intervene to forestall intervention from Europe . Thus licensed for intervention , U.S. marines marched in and out of Caribbean capitals and customs houses to protect U.S. investments for nearly three decades . By the time of the Good Neighbor Policy , the doctrine was in bad repute . It has not been invoked since it was expanded to protect Greenland from German seizure in 1941 . <P> But Khrushchev 's claim that Cuba was a Communist protectorate resurrected the Monroe Doctrine in a form close to the original . Eisenhower warned that " the U.S. will not permit the establishment of a regime dominated by international Communism in the Western Hemisphere . " Ike 's warning was unilateral , but as the State Department pointed out last week , the Monroe Doctrine has been built into joint policy by the nations of the Americas , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
