At first glance , it looked like a classic Latin American power grab . A long line of cars pulled up to the La Paz military airport , and Army General Alfredo Ovando escorted Air Force General Ren Barrientos to the steps of a waiting C-54 . Moments later , Barrientos was on his way to Switzerland . Only a few days before , Barrientos and Ovando had been co-Presidents of Bolivia 's 14-month-old military junta . Now , there was only Ovando . <P> In Bolivia , where things are seldom what they seem , the little tableau was actually normal democratic process . The junta had called presidential elections for July 3 . And Barrientos , the country 's leading candidate , was only sticking to the constitution , which provides that a candidate must resign any public office he holds six months before the balloting . To rest up and get in shape for the long campaign ahead , Barrientos decided to spend a few weeks abroad . <P> If his past performance is any gauge , Barrientos will need the rest . At least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controls of his rickety DC-3 and went whistle-stopping to the remotest corners of his Andean nation , donning Indian hats and ponchos , beaming through storms of confetti and trading quips with campesinos in their native Quechua tongue . He ran his government with the same dash and flamboyance . <P> Early last year , when Communist union leaders resisted his reforms for Bolivia 's notoriously inefficient tin mines , Barrientos slapped the mines under military control , ordered troops into troubled areas and exiled 200 union leaders , including Union Boss Juan Lechin . After a bloody series of battles that left 102 dead and 350 wounded , the miners finally gave in . Helped along by a high tin market , the mines moved from under a $3,000,000 deficit in the first five months of last year to a net year-end profit of some $2,000,000-their first year in the black since 1953 . <P> As the government candidate ( Ovando is n't interested ) and Bolivia 's most popular and colorful figure , Barrientos seems to have a clear field in the elections . Assuming , that is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barnstorming tours . As one of his friends comments : " Only a dead Barrientos will quit trying to be President . "
