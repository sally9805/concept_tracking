After he sold his controlling interest in the Chicago White Sox in 1961 , Bill Veeck never stopped itching to " get involved again with people . " In his best-selling 1962 autobiography Veeck-As in Wreck , he vowed : " Look for me under the arc lights , boys , I 'll be back . " Now , thumping the promotional drums as loudly as ever , the old Barnum of baseball has returned-but not to baseball . He is the new president and part owner of East Boston 's Suffolk Downs race track . <P> Though a rank novice at horse racing , Veeck , 55 , is already shaking up the Establishment . Astonished that the average age of the racing fan is 52 , he went to Superior Court and in June won a decision reversing the Massachusetts Racing Commission 's ban on children at the track . " I may not know much about horses , " said Veeck , " but I do know that we 've got to get the young ones in to develop new players . " Besides , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should n't kids be able to see what their old man is up to ? " <P> Lady Godiva . Such talk has drawn flocks of curious adults to Suffolk Downs to see what " Ole Bill , " as he calls himself , has been up to since taking over six months ago . The answer , as usual , is plenty . Built in 1935 on the site of an East Boston dump , Suffolk Downs seemed to be reverting to its original state . Veeck took one look at his new property and condemned it as " a combination money machine and concentration camp . " <P> Veeck immediately launched a $1,000,000 refurbishing program . The facade of sickly Suffolk green was replaced with vibrant yellow along with occasional splashes of cool blue and hot red . He personally took a sledgehammer to the dingy rest rooms , did away with pay toilets , ripped the barbed wire off the fences , ordered 24 apple trees planted in the infield and reduced the admission fee to $1.50 for both the clubhouse and the grandstand . " Notice the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tells passersby . " Color is so important . " <P> So is what happens on the track . On opening day three months ago , Veeck parlayed the current publicity for girl jockeys into a $10,000 Lady Godiva Handicap ( " Eight fillies on eight fillies " ) . Two weeks ago , he introduced the $252,750 Yankee Gold Cup , America 's richest race on grass . <P> Technically , the race was a fiasco ; among other things , Veeck allowed 14 starters-at least two too many for comfort on the narrow track . Still , he insists that the event was remarkably successful as a trial run . " After all , " he says , " we 're showing people that we 're trying to improve the quality of the sport in this area . " Quality , in fact , is the keynote of Veeck 's latest pitch . " You shoot off your fireworks and pull your stunts , " he says , " but all that is frosting on the cake . Great racing is the thing . " <P> Lots of Frosting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the frosting . In recent weeks , he has rewarded fans with such door prizes as 2,000 coloring books , a lifetime supply of balloons and 1,000 hot dogs . Between races , he has minstrels strolling around the grandstand . To lure more women to the betting windows , he is talking about exchanging trading stamps for each losing ticket .
