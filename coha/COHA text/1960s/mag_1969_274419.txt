Actors should be like martyrs burnt alive , still signaling to us from their stakes . <P> - Antonin Artaud <P> The actor makes a total gift of himself . <P> - Jerzy Grotowski <P> Artaud and Grotowski are as different as pure and applied science , but the latter would not be possible without the former . Artaud was an unsuccessful French actor who died insane in 1948 . He was also a visionary and a prophet with a dream of what theater might be . In poetic though sometimes muzzy language , he coined the idea of " a theater of cruelty . " To interpret the phrase solely by conventional usage is to miss a great deal of what Artaud meant by it . For example , he wrote , " Everything that acts is a cruelty , " and " Cruelty is rigor . " <P> Artaud 's vision encompassed a theater that could sweep through an audience like a plague , be as direct as a bullet , release the torments and ecstasies that may be found in death , martyrdom and love . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be reborn only through signs , sounds and the primitive force of myth . Above all , he wanted a burning intensity to be felt in the theater that would sear an audience : " The spectator who comes to us knows that he has agreed to undergo a true operation , where not only his mind but his senses and his flesh are going to come into play . He must really be convinced that we are capable of making him scream out . " <P> Anguish of the Age . Put that way , the Artaudian conception of theater sounds a trifle sadistic , and it can be comprehended only as a refraction of the European experience in the 20th century , with all of its tortures and holocausts . <P> If Brecht wanted to slap an audience into intellectual awareness so that it would correct the evils of the age , Artaud wanted to gore it into a blood-dripping emotional awareness of the anguish of the age ; Among those who have most notably tried to follow Artaud 's precepts in the modern theater are Julian Beck and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Marat/ Sade ) and Director Jerzy Gro-towski with his Polish Laboratory Theater . The Living Theater is sloppy , Brook is marvelously disciplined but a trifle too cerebral , and Grotowski combines fantastic discipline with lacerating emotional intensity .
