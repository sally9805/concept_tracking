MIDWEST // 1 . ILLINOIS ( 10-0 ) 2 . KANSAS ( 12-1 ) 3 . NOTRE DAME ( 7-2 ) // Fidel Castro deserved assists as Tulsa upset Missouri Valley Conference favorite Cincinnati 57-50 and defending champion Louisville 85-69 . It was because of Castro that Al Cueto , now the Hurricane center , fled Cuba several years ago . A surprisingly agile 6 ' 8 " and 235 pounds , Cueto pulled down 14 rebounds in two games and scored 23 points . Also helping out were Larry Cheatham , who played despite a torn ankle ligament and scored 23 points , and Bobby Smith , who scored 45 points and was the catalyst in the team 's new souped-up offense . Defensively , the Hurricanes switched from a zone to a man-to-man in the second half against the Bearcats , held them to just 15 points in the final 20 minutes and rallied for their ninth win in 11 tries . They then limited the Cardinals , who had been 9-0 , to their lowest output of the season . Worst hit was Butch Beard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wins against North Texas State and Wichita State , but made good on only six of 22 shots against the Hurricanes . Cincinnati , which had led Tulsa 35-28 at the half , squandered an identical lead against Wichita State and lost 67-66 . The only other MVC team unbeaten in the conference was Drake , which boosted its overall mark to 11-0 . The Bulldogs took their first two MVC games by beating Memphis State 73-71 on a jumper by Willie McCarter in the final 42 seconds , and then drubbing St. Louis 104-65. // Kansas won the Big Eight tournament in Kansas City , defeating Oklahoma State 56-45 , then narrowly averted a loss to Nebraska in the conference opener . The Corn-huskers used a sagging man-to-man to clog the Jayhawk shots under the basket in the second half and took a 50-49 lead with 1:50 to play . Bruce Sloan of the Jayhawks missed a drive-in but scored on a follow-up , and Kansas prevailed 56-52 . Colorado , rearing up as the most potent threat to Kansas in the Big Eight , easily took care of Oklahoma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State , which finally got its fast break untracked and outscored Iowa State 13-4 in the closing two minutes of a 75-65 victory . // " The Big Ten championship will be won with upsets , " said Northwestern 's Larry Glass . Big Ten teams , though , were upsetting only outsiders last week . Minnesota ended Detroit 's win streak at ten games 85-80 , despite 34 points by Spencer Haywood . ( Marquette also beat Detroit 85-71 , as Haywood had 35 points . ) And Wisconsin  --  which earlier in the season had upset Kansas and had lost by just one point to Notre Dame  --  shocked Kentucky 69-65 . With 6 ' 9 " Craig Mayberry , a JC transfer , on hand this season , the Badgers have moved Jim Johnson from center to forward , and his 27 points and 15 rebounds were instrumental in defeating the Wildcats . But then the Big Ten season got under way , and both the Gophers and Badgers lost . Illinois out-rebounded Minnesota 41-25 en route to an 80-58 win , while Rick Mount scored 33 points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ score any points , a $1.50 toy bulldog was credited with helping Northwestern . He has been sitting on the team bench since an opening game loss to Stanford and presumably watched the Wildcats beat Michigan State 85-71 for their ninth win in a row . Ohio State , after being jolted by Washington 64-59 , began defense of its Big Ten title by defeating Indiana 90-82. // Notre Dame had no trouble with American University , but had to come back from a 10-point halftime deficit to beat St. Peter 's ( N.J. ) 85-71 . That game was the first the Irish had to play without Austin Carr , the team 's leading scorer and playmaker . Carr broke his left foot in practice and is expected to be out for six weeks . // SOUTH // 1 . NORTH CAROLINA ( 9-1 ) 2 . DAVIDSON ( 8-1 ) 3 . KENTUCKY ( 7-2 ) // After strutting through the Midwest , LSU , Davidson and Duke came home , basked in the reflected glory of their respective wins over Duquesne , Michigan and Iowa  --  and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fresh from winning the All-College Tournament in Oklahoma City where Pete Maravich scored 53 points against Duquesne in the finals , were staggered by Alabama 85-82 . Pistol Pete , who had been shooting less this year in an effort to feed teammates and build victories , pulled the trigger 49 times against Alabama . He hit on 19 tries and wound up with 42 points  --  all to no avail . A botched-up play by St. John 's worked out well enough to lead to the downfall of Davidson , which lost 75-74 in the last two seconds of overtime . With the Wildcats leading 74-73 and seven seconds to go , they lost the ball to the Redmen because they were unable to pass inbounds within the allotted five seconds . St. John 's then carefully set up one last play , but instead of the ball going to John Warren in the corner , it went to 6 ' 10 " Bill Paultz , who was almost 30 feet from the basket . Paultz let fly with a desperation shot , the ball went through the net and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had beaten North Carolina in New York 's Holiday Festival , it was the second straight week they had defeated one of the country 's top-ranked teams . In Duke 's case , faulty strategy by an opponent proved just the stuff of victory . With 51 seconds left , Iowa decided to play for one last shot . It never came , as Fred Lind of the Blue Devils stole the ball with eight seconds left . Randy Denton of Duke , who had 25 points , added two foul shots in the closing moments to give the Blue Devils an 85-82 win . Then , like LSU and Davidson , Duke returned to the Southland and was defeated 94-70 by North Carolina as Charlie Scott scored 34 points for the Tar Heels . // LSU was not the only team to be upset in Southeastern Conference play . Tennessee was dumped by Mississippi State 58-57 , and Vanderbilt lost to Georgia 104-80 . Kentucky struggled to a 69-59 victory over Mississippi when Randy Pool came off the bench to score six straight points . The Wildcat bench , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 ' 2 " guard and the No. 6 man on the squad , quit the team because he felt he was not playing enough . // South Carolina looked as though it might be able to challenge North Carolina for the Atlantic Coast Conference title . The Gamecocks won the Quaker City Tournament in Philadelphia 62-59 by slowing down La Salle 's hurry-up offense , and then won their ACC opener from Clemson 77-62 . In winning the Quaker City affair , South Carolina used only five players , four of them sophomores . One of those youngsters  --  John Roche  --  had 24 points and eight assists against La Salle and won the MVP award . // EAST // 1 . ST . JOHN 'S ( 9-2 ) 2 . VILLANOVA ( 8-1 ) 3 . COLUMBIA ( 9-1 ) // Frank Gillen took a shot he did not want . The result was a 68-67 Villanova victory over St. Bonaventure . With four seconds left and the Bonnies in front 67-66 , the Wildcats missed a foul shot . Jim McIntosh of the Wildcats strained for the rebound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to go up in all that traffic and get fouled , " Gillen said later . " I did n't expect to get a shot off . But I had a chance , so I shot . " The Wildcats , trying earlier to contain Bob Lanier of the Bonnies , boxed him away from the backboard with two and sometimes three men , floating one man in front of him . Still , Lanier sank 11 of 15 shots . Exercising somewhat similar strategy , the Bonnies had overplayed Villanova 's Johnny Jones in the first half . Jones scored just one point during that time , but Howard Porter got 14 . In the second half , the Bonnies eased up on Jones and worked over Porter , only to have Jones plunk in 16 points and Porter another 11. // La Salle won a ball game  --  89-68 against Hofstra  --  but lost a ball player , Ken Durrett , a 6 ' 7 " sophomore with a scoring touch . He injured his right knee in the game and if he suffered torn ligaments  --  as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season . // Jack McKinney gave his St. Joseph 's team a pep talk with 6:36 left and Indiana leading 67-60 in a game to settle third place in the Quaker City Tournament . " You have to do it now , " McKinney implored his players . " It has to come from your guts . " After his Hawks had outscored the Hoosiers 17-1 , McKinney said , " That is ' superstomach ' play , to stick in there that long . " Mike Hauer 's 36 points did not hurt the Hawks ' cause , either , in their 80-72 win . // Princeton rallied , too , coming from nine points back in the last 10 minutes to defeat Penn 59-56 as Jeff Petrie scored 14 of the Tigers ' last 18 points . The next day the Tigers stopped Army 51-42 , making it the fourth straight loss for the Cadets  --  their longest losing streak since 1956-57 . Twenty-seven points by Jim McMillian carried Columbia to its ninth win in 10 games , a 79-52 victory over Cornell . A string of 14 consecutive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 92-68 . Providence , however , had to labor through three overtimes before downing Canisius 88-84. // WEST // 1 . UCLA ( 9-0 ) 2 . SANTA CLARA ( 12-0 ) 3 . NEW MEXICO STATE ( 11-0 ) // UCLA had the distinction of winning on both coasts , taking the Holiday Festival final at Madison Square Garden by defeating St. John 's 74-56 and beating Tulane at home 96-64 . The Redmen gave the Bruins a hard time in the first half , trailing only 31-27 . Then MVP Lew Alcindor , who had 30 points , got busy in the second half and the Bruins pulled away . Against the Green Wave , Alcindor was charged with a technical foul after he protested a foul by throwing the ball in the air . Coach John Wooden promptly benched him , with 12:30 left , but by that time he had 34 points . // According to one pro scout , the next big college center after Alcindor leaves this spring will not be nearly as tall but will be almost as talented . Jerry Krause of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been looking for . The player is Willie Sojourner , 6 ' 8 " , of Weber State . Says Krause , whose coach , Dick Motta , left Weber State only this season , " I 've looked all over the country and I have n't seen a sophomore center to match Willie . " And what has Sojourner done to deserve such praise ? Well , he is averaging 18 points and 13 rebounds a game , is hitting on 49% of his shots and has come up with a cross-lane hook and a power dipper . Sojourner 's cross-lane hook is taken while maneuvering across the foul line . His power dipper is a shot that comes at the end of a giant step toward the basket . Sojourner poises the ball on his fingertips and , at the end of his flight through the air , drops it in . With Justus Thigpen adding 17 points a game and with Sessions Harlan in charge of a vise-like defense , the Wildcats are now 8-1 and may well have their finest team ever . // Houston , continuing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ken Spain was bottled up by West Texas State 's sagging zone . Spain , whose shots stayed mainly out of the basket , scored just two points as the Cougars lost 86-76. // Santa Clara continued to look impressive . The Broncos won the Rainbow Classic in Honolulu , holding off Columbia for a 64-58 win . They then beat Oklahoma City 92-82 and won their West Coast Athletic Conference opener from San Francisco 86-66 . Doing the scoring for the Broncos was Dennis Awtrey ( 27 against both the Lions and Chiefs ) , Ralph Ogden ( 29 against the Chiefs ) and Bud Ogden ( 12 of 15 shots and 26 points against the Dons ) . // First place in Portland 's Far West classic went to Oregon , which beat Washington State 80-78 . A corner shot by Jim Henry in the waning moments made a winner out of the Ducks after Billy Gaskins stole the ball with 10 seconds left . Gaskins , who scored 23 points , was the tournament 's MVP . Rick Abrahamson of Oregon , of whom the Cougar scouting report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that and sank seven out of eight attempts . // Mike Newlin of Utah , who grew up in the Los Angeles area , returned to play there in the Sports Arena on his birthday against USC . His 32 points led the Redskins to an 80-72 upset win . Utah State surprised Colorado State 83-73 as Marv Roberts put in 31-points . Another high scorer was Nate Archibald , who made good on 12 of 13 shots and had 32 points as UTEP beat Arizona 93-83 and brought its record to 10-3 . Arizona sank only 29% of its first-half shots against Seattle , but 56% in the second half and won 75-66 . New Mexico State beat Albuquerque 91-81 and Idaho State 85-62 as Sam Lacey had 39 points and 39 rebounds . Butler , spurred on by 5 ' 8 " Steve Norris and 5 ' 10 " Steve Hardin , defeated New Mexico 81-80 in overtime . // In the first game of the Southwest Conference race SMU , tied for the cellar a year ago , won 81-78 from TCU , last season 's champion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
