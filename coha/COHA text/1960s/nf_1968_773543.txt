txt // perseverance , craftsmanship , co-operation in work , mutual assistance , team work , independence ( not being parasitic ) , resourcefulness , courage , creativeness in human relations ( respect for the personality of others , preservation of life and health , enhancing of the quality of life , contribution to human happiness and welfare , making creative use of one 's own powers ) . These qualities can be classified under headlines of love ; constructiveness ; inquiry ; courage . They are not separate . Love ? in the Christian sense of concern ? can not operate without the understanding of various things , including the people towards whom it is directed and the ways in which they can be assisted . Understanding comes through the operation of inquiry . No kind of creative activity can go on without knowledge . Courage is the operation against difficulties of one or more of the ethical goods . Any of the activities mentioned can be included under the general principle " . . . and thy neighbour as thyself " . This principle is basic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditions . It is found , for instance , in the teachings of Confucius and of Plato , and in the Hindu and Buddhist religions . One way of distinguishing good qualities is to think of those which are clearly not good , and to proceed from these to their opposites . People who hesitate over " constructiveness " as a good , for instance , have little difficulty in seeing " destructiveness " as bad . Other obviously bad qualities are hatred , carelessness , deceit , apathy , callousness and cruelty . In mentioning these qualities I should like to make it clear that what I am saying is that the qualities are good or bad , not that the people in whom they operate are to be praised or condemned . This distinction between the qualities and the people in whom they occur is necessary because there are circumstances in which the person who is doing something good may simply have been fortunate in his friends or in his opportunities , while the one who is hostile or insensitive or indifferent is almost certainly in need of help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goodness must be regarded not as the approved in human conduct , which varies with time , place and custom , but as that mental activity which , wherever and whenever it occurs , enhances the quality of human life . Two issues will be discussed in this chapter : Can schools be neutral in ethics ? and Do ethically good qualities benefit the good person ? I use the word " good " as describing certain mental processes , not the actions which may proceed , or appear to proceed from // such processes . I do not take it that an action is good in the ethical sense if it merely happens to be useful but does not proceed from a good motive . I am not equating " good " with " what is desired " or " what is approved " . I shall try to avoid the confusion that arises when ethical goods are called " values " . People value things for a variety of reasons . When equating " good " with certain " values " we usually have in mind the distinction between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the implication being that people who value what is not good are in error . This implication rests on the belief that what is ethically good is beneficial to the good person , and that " false values " , valuing what is bad , or at any rate , not good , lets people down in the end . I think this implication is , in fact , correct , but not so obvious that it can be assumed without further discussion to be true . The good qualities of mind have been , traditionally , the cooperative and constructive ones , those whereby trust is built and creative work goes on . Loving one 's neighbour is good ; hatred and hostility and resentment are bad . Forgiveness is good ; revenge is bad . Construction is good ; destruction is bad . Trustworthiness is good ; deceit is bad . I have avoided saying that " truthfulness is good " because people often read this as meaning that telling the truth when nobody wants to hear it is good , which nobody , I think , ever has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creatively that is good . The ethical question turns on whether truth-telling is constructive or destructive in a given situation . One point that requires emphasis , I think , is the ethical quality of genuine inquiry ( or invention , discovery , extending of understanding , etc . ) . Nearly every increase in production depends upon an extension of knowledge . Inquiry is bound up with making , contributing , helping . It is itself a productive activity . Here , as in the case of the use of the term " good " we must consider carefully the nature of the mental process . " Inquiry " can be simulated . There are people passing examinations and collecting degrees whose motives are far from any spirit of inquiry . There is a difference between thinking . " I 'd like to have that job because I like doing research " , and " I 'd like to have that job , so I 'll appear to be interested in research " . Among the qualities considered good in all major religions and philosophies are those that have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precepts of Confucius , for instance , is that one should not do to others what one does not want done to oneself ) . There is also an emphasis on willingness to work , and to work with others . Socrates , in The Republic , speaking of " justice " where I // would use the word " good " , says that without justice even a gang of thieves would be incapable of any joint action , for they would be always fighting and quarrelling . His notion of the just state is that in which people can live together harmoniously and do their work most effectively . The good qualities , then , are qualities of mental activities , and they are the qualities having something to do with love , creativity and enterprise , with constructing , with increase of welfare , with improving the quality of human life , and with preserving life . I think there is a tendency to regard the good qualities in men as having more to do with courage and resolution , with getting things done , and the good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal relations , in showing sympathy and helpfulness . I have been told that men would rather be regarded as " tough " than " nice " . This , if true , is an example of the distinction between " values " and ethics . The suggestion is that some good qualities are more valued by men than others . What I am contending is that some qualities are good irrespective of who values them . I take it that goodness is a quality , and value a relation ( somebody values something , X has the relationship V to Y ) and that the quality does not depend on the relation . A good activity is good even if nobody values or even notices it . A good activity is good even if it is disapproved of , even if the person performing it is persecuted for it . When people are martyred for their beliefs we do not regard their actions as bad although they are obviously not , at the time and place in which they occur , accepted or valued . Goodness is sometimes valued and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's reaction to it . I want to make it clear that there is a difference between something being good and its being valued , even if some people value goodness more than anything else . The economic and the ethical senses of " good " are different though not unrelated . ( Economic goods are the objects of demand . ) The good motives look to something outside the self . They are not self-regarding . Their object is the building up of something external to the person building it . The operation of this sort of motive , though not self-regarding , does in fact benefit the individual concerned . People can benefit themselves by thinking about something else . This is recognized in , for example , occupational therapy , where the patient 's health is assisted by his thinking about something other than himself , by taking an interest in something other than his own welfare . The self-regarding motives are both bad and harmful to the person in whom they operate . The traditional Seven Deadly Sins // ( pride , lust , covetousness , greed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Resentment , self-pity , and jealousy are examples of self-regarding , bad , harmful motives , being harmful to the person in whom they operate and to those with whom he comes in contact too . In referring to the Seven Deadly Sins I do not want to give the impression that I am equating good and bad with activities for which people should be praised or blamed . The use of the term " sin " suggests transgression , and is generally taken to mean wilful and avoidable transgression . My view is that the person concerned may not always be to blame for his bad mental activities . The mind can be in a bad state ( through illness for instance ) in circumstances where blame would be quite inappropriate . Similarly , people can be performing good activities in circumstances where praise is not called for . Praise and blame are appropriate in circumstances where the person praised or blamed has some choice in doing good or bad , and when that person is likely to be influenced by the support or rejection which praise and blame indicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bad ways . For instance , to blame a person for apathy and depression when that person is mentally ill can increase the illness rather than assist the cure . This is an unco-operative and unconstructive thing to do . Since , in fact , this kind of destructiveness is often performed by people who do not realize that they are doing harm , this is an appropriate point to indicate that inquiry is an ethical good . People often excuse themselves by saying " I did n't know " in circumstances where they quite easily could have known had they tried , that is , where they could have known if the spirit of inquiry had been operating . If it is good to want to help it is also good to try to find out how to do so , and bad to inflict harm through remediable ignorance . This example brings out the close connection between inquiry and sympathy , and between inquiry and considerateness . To be considerate one must consider , and to do this is to inquire . Here , as in constructing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and inquiry . To do anything constructive with human personality one must know something . Praise and blame can both be constructive . Praise is constructive when it strengthens good motives working against difficulties . This is what happens in the many cases where somebody has been able to proceed to achievement by the encouragement of someone else . Blame can be constructive as , for example , when it teaches a child the consequences of what he is doing . It can be a way of making the child think of what harm he may do . It may thus be // a way of assisting inquiry . It may be a way of indicating that one is not supporting bad motives , and thus of showing the person concerned that they are bad . Praise and blame are effective only if the persons to whom they are directed are fairly co-operative , if they care what the person praising or blaming thinks , and where it is realized that the person praising or blaming is competent to judge . Questions of ethics are often confused with questions of obligation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obligatory , but they are not the same thing . To say that something is good is not to say that everyone should do it . For instance , to say that it is good to build up the confidence of people who are too diffident to do the constructive things of which they would otherwise be capable is not to say that everyone could do it if he tried . It is only in special circumstances that people have the requisite knowledge and skill , and sufficient co-operation with the person they are trying to help , to make assistance possible . Many people would do more harm than good by trying to encourage others . Similar considerations apply in the operation of other goods . This , I think , is what Kant meant when he said : " I ought " implies " I can " . He did not mean that if an activity is good the power to perform it is conferred on everyone . He meant that it is meaningless to say that someone " ought " to do something which is impossible for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do certain things if some other conditions are to be fulfilled . " I ought to do X " means " I must do X if I am to have Y " . People have obligations as members of groups . If they are to retain membership honestly then they must act in ways which membership entails . If a student is to retain his scholarship , for instance , he must attend to his work . " I ought to do more work this term " may mean : " I must do more work this term if I am to keep my scholarship ( and hence my membership of the university ! ) " . It could mean also : " I must do more work this term if I am to justify my parents ' trust in me . " In this instance the obligation is to act in certain ways to maintain a certain structure of family membership , the structure based on trust . ( Physical membership of a family is not the same thing as being accepted in the family . ) It is sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation . Suppose , for example , that a teacher pretends to have done some work which he has not done . Is this a matter of obligation or of ethics ? The answer is that it is both . A person could argue that in neglecting his duties as a member of staff he is only forfeiting that membership , and that if he does // not particularly care whether he is employed as a staff member or not the failure to complete the required work does not matter . However , in the example given , the failure to meet a staff obligation was accompanied by deception , by an attempt to obscure the truth , to do the contrary of assisting inquiry ? in fact to block inquiry , to mislead somebody regarding the truth . In this simple example , then , we have a combination of a bad activity ( deception ) and a failure in group membership ( failure to do the work ) . And since membership of a group of this kind depends on its members ' being able to trust one another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A controversial point here is whether perhaps everyone has an obligation to perform good activities and refrain from bad ones . If there is this universal obligation then every bad activity will be a breach of obligation . There is a religious argument which holds that everyone has an obligation to God , that it is the will of God that we do good , and that every failure to do good is a breach in the obligation to God . The deliberate and avoidable breach of such an obligation is called sin . Transgressions resulting from ignorance or occurring under duress do not count as sin because what is involved in sin is a process of mind . The transgression is in the thought , not in the action alone . Conversely " to do the right thing for the wrong reason " is not to fulfil the obligation to God . T. S. Eliot in Murder in the Cathedral makes Becket call this " the greatest treason " . If there is a universal obligation to do good then all deliberate and unavoidable bad activities are sins . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by God we can distinguish between their being good and their being commanded . We can intelligibly ask whether something is commanded because it is good or good because it is commanded . And we can intelligibly speak of the goodness of God . My point here is that even those people who regard every ethical problem as a religious one distinguish between the ethical quality of good and bad activities and the relation of such activities to God . They do not take it that goodness is constituted by its relationship to God . It is precisely because this distinction is made that there is difficulty in interpreting some Biblical injunctions , such as " make unto thyself friends of the mammon of unrighteousness " and " the Lord commended the unjust steward " , in the parable of the talents . There could be no difficulty in reconciling these passages with our notion of good if goodness were definable as " what is commanded " . Applying this view of ethics to schools it is clear that all schools , x // whether secular or not , must carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either assisting the development of their pupils or hindering it . They are either creative or destructive . Creative schooling , in the theory that I have put forward , is good . To educate at all the school must carry on good activities . I take it that schools in our society are intended to educate in the sense of promoting understanding . This comes only through inquiry . The prominence of inquiry is what marks off an educational institution from others which are concerned with the welfare of children , such as clinics or hospitals or orphanages or play centres . ( All of these can educate to some extent . Education , however , is not the primary aim in establishing them . ) Inquiry flourishes where there is a friendly atmosphere and where the other kinds of constructive activity go on ( aesthetic appreciation and production , for instance , whether in art lessons or in making the school attractive , or in teaching aids , or in the pupils ' notebooks ; constructiveness with regard to the development of personality , too , interacts with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assist one another ) . Education , then , if it is inquiry , is an ethical good , and it progresses in the company of other ethical goods , of other creative activities . Whether the school teaches ethics is a different question . People can be participating in good activities without inquiring into the nature of good and without even thinking about the ethical qualities of what they are doing . Good activities are performed for their own sake , not because they are good . We can not usually make ourselves change our attitude to , for instance , our work or to another person simply by knowing that doing so would be good . Good activities usually grow by contact with other good activities , as when pupils emulate a teacher or another person to whom the teacher draws the pupil 's attention , rather than by precept , though there are some cases where advice and exhortation assist the good . We can not , however , take it that the school teaches ethics because what it does is good . There is a difference between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not at all likely to teach ethics in the way in which this subject is studied at universities . The university method usually involves looking at different ethical theories , examining carefully the terminology used , and considering whether the theories involve inconsistency or perhaps a denial of observed facts . The question of whether there is a positive study at all is raised , with the suggestion that ethics may only be an indication of // approval or disapproval of certain customs . This sort of study of ethics is obviously not suitable for schools . While we can not study ethics in schools we can not avoid teaching it in the same sense that we teach politeness or co-operation . The analogy with politeness makes the situation clear . We do not usually make a comparative study of etiquette in schools . We do not debate whether etiquette depends on various forms of social organization nor whether its precepts are contradictory or its vocabulary confused . What we do is to convey to the children what we believe to be the acceptable way to behave in such social situations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the same way . We communicate some kind of ethical position to pupils even if we do not discuss it . In fact , we indoctrinate pupils with our own ethics and can not avoid doing so . There must be some relationship between pupils and teachers , and among pupils , and teachers tend to support the relationships they think good and to oppose those they think bad . Their own ethical thinking may be operating at a fairly low level . They may , for instance , be taking it that what is good is what assists their work and what is bad is what opposes it . In this sort of situation " good " pupils may be unpopular with unsuccessful ones because of their " goodness " . Again , the teacher may believe that he is avoiding the controversial subject of ethics by exhorting pupils to work hard in order to get on in the world . When this takes place the subject of ethics has not been avoided . What has been taught is that competitiveness is good . I think it would clarify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confidence in classroom procedure , if they would think out their ethical principles explicitly . Ethics is not so controversial as is usually believed , and is not inextricably tied up with religion . Most people would agree that consideration for others is good , that co-operation of various kinds is good ( including the co-operation involved in avoiding deceit and theft ) . Most would agree that wilfully harming another person , whether by bodily injury , slander or interference with property is bad . Most would agree that destructiveness is bad and creativeness good . And , since schools have a special interest in inquiry they usually recognize in some way that the pursuit of truth is good ( though in practice this pursuit may be heavily overlaid by the pursuit of ways to deceive the examiners ) . It is also fairly generally agreed that the good activities I have mentioned ( love , creativeness , inquiry ) are beneficial to the person in whom they operate as well as to those with whom he associates . People do not need to be experts in psychology or medicine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boredom make people unhappy and unable to get on with necessary work or ordinary human relationships . It is well known that it is good for people to have an interest ( this is often mentioned in reference to convalescence and old age ) ; that is , it is recognized that people benefit from thinking creatively . To the list : love , creativeness , inquiry , I should perhaps add a fourth good : courage . This is difficult to distinguish from the others , which all interact with one another , since it means the operation against difficulties of one or more of the other goods . ( In listing good activities in this way I follow the late Professor John Anderson of the University of Sydney . ) I began this chapter by asking two questions . To the first I have answered that a school can educate only if it carries on good activities and that the school does some incidental teaching of ethics , some of it not very satisfactory . To the second question : Do ethical qualities benefit the good person ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that this fact is usually recognized , though it is often not seen as an ethical issue . I wish to make a protest here against the theory that what schools inculcate in their pupils are middle-class values . My main objection is to the notion that honesty , thrift , industriousness and ambition are peculiarly the possession of the middle class . Since many people now in the middle class ( I take it that this means people who do clean work and are dependent on this rather than on their capital for their income ) have come from the working class , there must be a considerable " middle-class " orientation in the working class . The values mentioned in fact belong as much to the working class as to anyone else . At the other end of the scale , I suspect that it is erroneous to assume that upper class people are all or mostly lazy , extravagant , dishonest and without ambition . I suggest that what actually happens is that schools emphasize such virtues as assist the running of schools , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The middle-class vice of competitiveness is much cultivated in schools because it appears to expedite learning . The main source of good activities in the schools is the communication of the teacher 's own creative activities . The teacher who has a creative attitude to learning , and to making personal relationships will communicate this attitude to the pupils , provided , of course , that the teacher has reached the stage of being able to // relate co-operatively to pupils . Whatever other stimulus there may be the central point in the teaching process is the teacher 's own interest in inquiry and the teacher 's own ability to work with other people . The process of co-operative inquiry is itself ethically good and it is the basis of the school 's ethical influence . 12 ? Religion and Schooling Arguments frequently used in current controversy about state aid to church schools in Australia are : " Catholics are bound by conscience to send their children to church schools ; they are therefore entitled to assistance from the state in providing Catholic schools " and ( on the other side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay for it " . The first of these arguments rests on the assumption that nonCatholics recognize the special character of the Catholics ' obligation regarding schooling . People often do not in fact recognize this . One letter in a newspaper controversy suggested that if a parent 's conscience told him to educate his children in Switzerland he would be as much entitled to state aid as are the Catholics . The second argument assumes that education with a religious bias is an extra which people should pay for if they want it , and that state education is satisfactory as far as it goes . This overlooks the Catholic belief that no secular education is satisfactory at all , and that religion is not something to be added to ordinary teaching , but important in the education process itself . This argument is complicated by the fact that many people who use it are not thinking of Catholic schools but of Protestant ones , and are not thinking of the religious aspect of them , but of their being schools where fees are paid . Much of the discussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue with that of social status . The result is that public opinion is influenced by what is really another question , but one which could well be asked : Should the state assist people who pay more for their children 's schooling than most people are able or willing to pay ? This question is relevant to present conditions because aid is being given to non-state schools to provide for the teaching of science . Presbyterian schools in New South Wales have refused this aid . Most // non-Catholic church schools ' pupils come from the upper socioeconomic groups , though all social classes are represented in them . Scholarships prevent their being entirely " exclusive " . As this chapter is on religion and schooling I shall leave the issue of " aid to exclusive schools " without further comment , although I think it is an important one . The issue which I want to raise is whether religion is educative or not . Those who strongly support the teaching of religion would probably continue to do so even if it were demonstrated that religion prevents or hinders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To say that something is educative ( in certain senses ) is not to say that it is good . People can quite sensibly say that if religion in fact prevents or hinders the development of understanding in some matters then this development of understanding is less important to them than is religion . Most people in fact believe that there is some understanding that we would be better without , though they are not all agreed as to what the dispensable areas of understanding are . To ask , then , whether religion is educative is not to ask whether it is desirable . Opinion is sharply divided on the issue : Is religion educative ? and the division of opinion , often not made explicit , affects arguments about church schools and the state 's attitude to them . Some of the people opposing aid to church schools are thinking not only : " These schools should not have public money " , but also : " These schools should n't exist at all . They teach dangerous error . They do n't just teach , they indoctrinate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking clearly . " To this may be added such accusations as that religion is " the dope of the workers " ( i.e. , that it promotes submission to capitalist oppression ) or that it is a device for frightening people into supporting a parasitic class of people in religious orders . The common feature of arguments of this kind is the accusation that religion prevents clear thinking . Added to this are the various suggestions as to the motives behind this prevention . The point I am here concerned with is the alleged prevention of thinking , not the motives which might cause it . The argument used by those who think religion uneducative is not just that religion is false , but that its acceptance depends on indoctrination . Indoctrination , when this term is used by people who do not like it , means gaining the acceptance of a belief by some means other than investigation . Education , in this view , can be distinguished from indoctrination in that when we educate we present what we believe to be true , but we allow dissent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may contain error . Indoctrinators , on // the other hand , regard the material with which they indoctrinate as sacred , and any criticism of it as wicked . I think this is a fair enough distinction between indoctrination and education in the cases where there is any distinction between them . In some contexts indoctrinating simply means teaching , but I am here discussing indoctrination in the repressive sense of the term , the sense in which it is used when speaking of advertisers whom one dislikes , or of the other side in political controversy . The point at issue is , then , whether religious teaching is indoctrination in the sense of treating religious matters as sacred , and not suitable for investigation , inquiry , discussion or criticism . I think we can easily find samples , in the teaching of religion to young children , where just this is done . Children of all denominations are taught to repeat words , in hymns , prayers or sacred writings , where they can not possibly investigate the truth of what they are saying . In some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the words mean . In many cases they are confronted with pictures and symbols intended to impress religious beliefs and attitudes , and this impression is frequently successful . At an early age many children are present at religious services where , though they can understand little else , they gain a feeling of the solemnity of the proceedings , and perhaps some sense of reverence and commitment . All of this is , I think , clearly indoctrination in the sense in which I have used the term . Indoctrination of this kind is used by all sects . It is used in the most austere forms of Protestantism no less than among those who use elaborate ritual and much symbolism . The reading or repetition of Biblical texts is , in this sense , just as much indoctrination as is participation in any set form of service . The point relevant to our discussion is that acceptance is preceding criticism , and , if this is uneducative , then most , and perhaps all , teaching of religion to children of primary school age is uneducative . It would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the uneducativeness of religion at least for children . Before , however , proceeding to the conclusion that much religious teaching is uneducative , I would ask how other material is taught to children of this age . If they are unable to investigate the truth or falsity of catechism are they able to investigate the truth or falsity of history ? Are they able to investigate statements to the effect that they are doing something wrong , or rude , or dangerous ? If theology is too hard for them to be critical of it , is ethics , sociology or medicine within their scope ? In the school curriculum what subjects , other than mathematics and spelling , are capable of verification by young children ? Investigation of // arithmetical facts is fashionable at present ( with the advent of Cuisenaire material ) , but spelling is usually taught in a quite dogmatic way , and long before the children are likely to have any interest in treating the teacher 's pronouncements about it as corrigible . Indoctrination in obedience , politeness and safety are common in most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossing the street in heavy traffic , hitting the baby or striking matches . If children are to survive they must be indoctrinated in some matters . And , if this is so , why single out religious teaching as uneducative ? Nearly all teaching of young children is , on this criterion , indoctrination . The secularist reply to this is that , while it is true that children must accept much secular instruction before they can criticize it , the educator in secular subjects proceeds gradually to develop inquiry as the child becomes mature enough . Teachers who do not gradually develop inquiry are not educating . I think that we come here to the crucial point of the controversy . Does religion require , at all stages , acceptance without investigation ? Does it require acceptance of a kind different from the acceptance necessary to study anything at all ? ( We must make some assumptions in order to investigate anything . We must assume such things as that the external world exists , that our senses do not always deceive us , that the sun will rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only one in existence . ) Are the teachings of religion corrigible in the same sense as are the teachings of professors of history or of science ? It is easy to find examples of people who object to the investigation of religion . This , however , does not prove the secularist point . There are also people who object to the investigation of politics and morality , but it does not follow that these subjects can not be taught educatively . Any subject at all can be uneducatively taught . Some supporters of the teaching of religion in schools say that truth can not conflict with truth and that investigation can only strengthen religion . Accordingly , they welcome inquiry . If the school teaching of religion is conducted on these principles it can be as educative as any other subject . As in other studies , the field for investigation will enlarge with the increasing maturity and interest of the learner . If someone here raises the objection that there will always be an unexplained portion of religion my reply is that the same is true of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind , such as literature and art , without knowing what the mind is . We study science without knowing what matter is . We do not know how the universe came into being , nor do we know what // time and space are , or whether they are finite or not . There is something inconsistent , I think , in the demand that pupils should not learn the Apostles ' Creed until its truth has been demonstrated while at the same time asking that they accept the findings of nuclear physics . My main point is that , while religion is often taught uneducatively it can be educatively taught . On the other hand , there are many people to whom the kind of religious teaching I have indicated would be unacceptable . Those who feel that the approach to religion is not through understanding but through acceptance of mystical truths , who believe that religion is not inquiry , but only worship or reverence or commitment , support a kind of religious teaching which is , in the sense in which I use the term , uneducative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in religion prevents thinking in other fields . I suggest that the school which omits religion from its teaching is thereby less educative than it could have been , even if we equate " education " and " inquiry " . Inquiry suffers if children are never brought face to face with such questions as the nature and origin of the universe , the relation between mind and body ( or between the spiritual and the material ) , the nature of good and evil , questions of moral obligation or duty , and whether life has a purpose . Where , except in religion , are children confronted with these issues in a challenging way ? Even if you are sure that the answers taught will contain error are you sure that it is more educative to avoid such matters altogether ? It is true that these questions are philosophical and that there are ways of discussing them other than in the teaching of religion . Is it , however , at all likely that a course in philosophy , concentrating on controversial issues , will be established in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protest from time to time about the alleged discussion of religion and morals in university classes in philosophy . It is very unlikely indeed that it will be practicable to provoke controversy in such matters as free will or materialism or morality with pupils of school age . If the central problems of existence are encountered at all in schools it will be through the teaching of religion . Similarly , if in schools there is to be any inducement to serious consideration of the conduct of one 's life , this will also come through religion . Where else is any motivation other than that of trying to " get on in the world " presented ? My view is that the secular curriculum omits subjects which are of immediate interest and importance to everyone and that pupils who have never given serious attention to ethics and meta114 Educative Teaching physics are not educated . Even if the pupils and perhaps their parents disagree with the answers given in religious teaching , they benefit from contact with its problems . The controversial nature of religion is an argument for teaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is true that religious instruction is often given badly , and in adverse circumstances . This is not a reason for abandoning the subject . It is a reason for improved teaching . It is sometimes contended that aid should not be given to church schools because it is undemocratic to have different kinds of schooling . This contention equates uniformity with democracy . To argue that uniformity and central control are democratic seems to me to be to argue that democracy and totalitarianism are the same . If , however , we take it that a democratic state is one where power is diffused through all social classes , and that in democracy initiative can come from the governed as well as from those who govern , I think it follows that diversity in education is essential if democracy is to be maintained . A single , centrally controlled system is a menace to democracy , and the more efficient it is the greater the danger . Such a system can easily be used to direct the thinking of a large proportion of the population . Even in the comparatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rightly or wrongly , that they must teach as their superiors direct . Even if these people are not in fact as enslaved now as they claim to be they are because of their fear of victimization , excellent material for enslavement in an emergency . ( I take it that the slave is the person whose actions are directed by others . ) Free people have rights of free speech , publication and assembly . One of the signs that a country is free is that non-government education is allowed . One of the signs that Russia is not at present a free country is that only the state may provide formal education . Churches operate for worship , but they are not permitted to teach . Hitler and Mussolini suppressed independent schools . There is nothing democratic about having people all taught the same way . On the contrary , this endangers democracy . What we should be thinking about if we want to support democracy is not how to make teaching the same for everyone , but how we can encourage the development of constructive diversity even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( I have put in the word " constructive " because merely being different for the sake of not conforming does not help democracy . What are needed are areas of creativeness of various kinds . ) A uniform system in which some of the // teachers believe they will be penalized for originality supports not democracy but tyranny . I would here like to ask whether perhaps the centralized system of New South Wales ( and other states ) has outlived its usefulness . The New South Wales system in its present form was established under the Public Instruction Act of 1880 . Before this , state aid was given to denominational schools . One reason for withdrawing aid was that in a sparsely populated country it was wasteful to have several schools in a country town . This difficulty is not now so acute , since the population has increased , and in any case the difficulty could always have been overcome by giving aid only to schools of sufficient enrolment , and by limiting the establishment of new small schools in areas of insufficient population . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving aid to schools opened in competition to existing state schools etc. ) before 1880 . The other , and more immediate reason for withdrawing aid was a quarrel between Archbishop Vaughan and Henry Parkes . Parkes declined to help church schools when the Archbishop attacked the " godless public schools " . It is conceivable that things could be more amicably managed now . Is there any good reason why , where size of the population warrants having more than one school , we should not have , with state aid , schools run by people with different interests and different beliefs . Could we not have , as England does , primary schools run by Catholics and Anglicans ? And what about Jewish schools ? And Rudolf Steiner schools ? Humanist schools ? Communist schools ? What about non-denominational schools with a bias in special directions , such as towards art or music or science or languages ? Is there any justification for our present uniformity except that it is what most of us are used to ? Australia provides equality of opportunity to a degree uncommon in school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system ? Is our equality the result of centralized control , or is it the outcome of our social system ? I think the main point here is that to maintain equality of opportunity we must have centralized financial management . Local finance would mean a good school in Killara and a poor one in Kelly 's Plains . England has a system of substantial aid to church schools . This does not mean that the children of poor parents suffer . No school receiving money from the rates ( as distinct from taxation , which goes through the treasury ) can charge fees . We are unfamiliar with the church school which is free to all pupils , and people commonly are confused on this point because as soon as they think of a non-state school they assume that equality of // opportunity is in danger . The question whether equality of opportunity means identical school provision arises here , along with the question of what this equality is . Academic freedom is the freedom of teachers ( this includes professors , lecturers etc. ) to state and publish what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this freedom in universities than in schools . Few people really believe in academic freedom even when they say they do . People are liable to say they uphold academic freedom and then to go on to say that a lecturer should present his views in an impartial , detached , dispassionate way . If people must not take sides on issues where their feelings are strongly involved they do not have academic freedom . To say : " He is free so long as he talks reasonably " is to say : " He is not free at all . " If people are free to speak they are free to speak erroneously and as partisans . It is usually assumed , of course , that the teacher with academic freedom will be competent in his subject , that he will teach what is relevant to his subject , and that he will be motivated by a desire to enlighten his pupils and not by a desire to use them to support the causes in which he is interested . These things are matters of professional competence . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is so erroneous as to constitute incompetence and the teaching which is merely controversial . It is not unusual to feel that the beliefs of one 's opponents are " obviously " mistaken . It is , for instance , obvious to some people that the two world wars were caused by capitalism and its resultant imperialism . It is equally obvious to other people that this view is wrong , and that national rivalry can cause war irrespective of the economic organization of the rivals ( rival socialist states could go to war no less than rival capitalist ones ) . Teachers in non-state schools , other than Catholic ones , have less academic freedom than have state school teachers . Employees of the Department of Education are protected by the fact that they are carrying out the directions of a remote office . They are less accessible to parents than are teachers in independent schools , and parents have less influence on courses and procedure . Even so , there is constant pressure from the public to prevent teachers from saying controversial things . They do not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They must avoid saying things which any of the parents do not like . They must also avoid saying things which the children are likely to distort in repetition at home into something objectionable to the parents . Few people seem to mind about this anti-educational state of // affairs . Education is obstructed when teachers must not discuss controversial issues , because these are precisely the ones where there is most interest . It is much easier to enlist the interest of adolescents in something which is a matter of adult controversy than in something which is a well-known fact . Relevance to adult life is one of the factors which motivates learning . It is the lack of academic freedom that prevents the secular school from raising the issues I mentioned earlier in connection with religion . It would be possible , if the public would allow it , to discuss whether everything has a cause , how mind moves matter , whether time ever began , or what reality is . These questions could be discussed where they arise , for instance , in history or science or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussion wherever it led . They can not , without risk , do so at present . People who claim that church schools restrict inquiry because of their bias towards theism might perhaps consider what is the effect on inquiry of having to avoid discussing religion , or any other controversial question at all . Perhaps this political example will make my point clear . Some years ago the New South Wales Correspondence School was attacked for circulating a social studies leaflet on the U.S.S.R. This was for children at the primary level and described the life of a family in a flat in , I think , Moscow . Exception was taken , not to the published facts , which were not in doubt , but to the omission of any indication that the Russians are bad people who had a violent revolution . The pamphlet was withdrawn , with apologies , by the Correspondence School . It had , they explained , been written by a very respectable lady member of their staff during the war , when we were friendly with the U.S.S.R. 13 ? Education and Social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differs from what Karl Marx meant when he said that " the history of all hitherto existing society is a history of class struggles " . ( The Communist Manifesto , 1847 . ) What Marx criticized was a social structure in which there was a ruling class ( at one time a class of feudal landowners , at another of owners of the means of production such as factories ) and this ruling class directed not only // production but also government . The " class " society was the predemocratic one . In 1847 there were class societies throughout Europe , and all European societies recorded in history had been divided into rulers and ruled . The so-called democracy of Athens was one where political participation was open only to the free . There was a large non-participating class of slaves . This is the structure which Aristotle said was justified by the inability of many people to make decisions for themselves . Justified or not , it is the pattern which prevailed until machines were invented which do enough work to make possible the extension of leisure and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to all parts of society . It is unusual for pre-industrial societies to be democratic . When people maintain that there is social class in Australia today they usually do not mean that there is a ruling class . We can test this by asking which is the ruling class . It is true that some individuals have more power than others , in so far as wealth confers power , but this is not unchallenged power . There is power also ( and mainly ) in organizations , power which is exercised through , for instance , trade unions , government departments , universities , employers ' associations and political parties . The political power exercised through elections is not confined to a ruling class . The more obviously powerful groups are not always the same : different groups come into prominence in varying circumstances . There is a changing balance of power and no permanent rulers . While we do not have a social class in the sense in which this still exists in some developing countries , and in communist countries , where the power is clearly held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards a classless society , we do have different socio-economic groups , groups of people who associate and have common interests in work and leisure . This is what people mean when they say : " Of course there is a social class in our town . Mrs. A. would never dream of having the X 's to dinner . " In this view a person 's social classification is partly voluntary and is influenced by what he ( or more often , she ) believes it to be . It depends also , to some extent , on the cultivation of particular habits of speech , manner , dress , housekeeping and so on . This is not the kind of social class which has in the past represented grave injustice and has given rise to revolutions . The term " upper class " varies in meaning . When used in England it usually means people who belong or have belonged to a landowning group , though it may be extended to owners of other kinds of property . In Australia people frequently state that the upper class are doctors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is made without qualifications as to the origins of the doctors and lawyers . I think the graziers indicated are those whose families have held large properties for several generations . The interesting point is the ready assumption that high salary puts a person in the upper class . I was interested to be told by members of a Diploma in Education class last year that university professors are upper class . I think that the position in Australian society , whatever may be the case elsewhere , is that hierarchies , where these are recognized at all , exist within a number of different groups rather than along a single scale . There are people with prestige in one group whom another group rarely thinks about . For instance , there are people for whom the currently fashionable popular singers are the upper class and who have only the haziest notion of what academics or politicians are , let alone of which individuals are outstanding in those areas . There are also divisions within academic and other groups , for instance , the scientific academics might know little of leaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1966 number of Oxford illustrates my point : Two Heads of colleges were walking up Parks Road about 1 o'clock p.m. , and the labs and libraries were disgorging young students by the score and even hundreds . The Heads communed as follows : All Souls : " Who are all these people engaged in all sorts of important work and we do not know who they are ? " Wadham : " The thing that really matters is that they do not know who we are . " The aspect of the class situation with which I am here concerned is its relation to social equality rather than its connection with prestige or envy or contempt for those regarded as inferiors . The relation of education to contempt and envy is that it contends against these as against other negative ethical attitudes which are the product of ignorance . I deal with this point elsewhere in my discussions of education and ethics . I deal with it briefly now by saying that if schooling produces destructive personal relationships the schooling is not , in this respect , educative . Education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for human development . The term " equality " is much misunderstood now , perhaps because our society has so much less than other and past societies of the grossest inequalities . The French revolutionaries who used " equality " as one of their slogans were not asking that everyone should be the same , nor were the Americans lacking in ordinary perception when they stated in the Declaration of Independence that they held it to be // self-evident that " all men are created equal " . Students who mistakenly believe that the notion of equality was invented by communists often believe that they have refuted communism by pointing out that people are different and can not be made identical . Identity , however , has nothing to do with equality as the term is used in social theory . A demand of the French revolutionaries which gives some indication of what is meant by equality in social contexts is " the career open to talent " . In some societies people are debarred by birth from developing talents which , had they been born into another class , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In our society the gross inequalities in opportunity have been eliminated . Schooling of much the same kind is available to nearly everyone . There are still children deprived of schooling because they live in remote areas without people who can supervise correspondence lessons , and others are deprived because of parental neglect . It is , however , no longer the case that children are deprived of schooling because of social class in the sense of it being deliberately withheld from some sections of the population . In Australia , in cases where children have unsatisfactory access to schooling this is an individual family matter and not a class one . The major problem in inequality of educational opportunity at the school level is inequality in ability to benefit from the available type of schooling , rather than inequality of access to it . Education at home is a great asset in benefiting from education at school . In Australia , careers are open to talent if the talent is sufficiently outstanding . Law , medicine , politics , the public service and so on are open to those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases the student must be outstanding to win the scholarship which will pay an allowance and exempt him from fees . It is possible for gifted individuals to rise to high political and professional positions , but it does not follow from this that the " career open to talent " has been achieved , or that there is equality of access on the basis of ability . Moderate ability with the help of family finance can achieve what the person without financial help from home can achieve only if particularly brilliant and particularly diligent . There are , for instance , people entering the professions without scholarships because their parents can pay for them to go through universities . An aspect of this situation is that there are probably many people in the teaching profession who would have entered law or medicine if the scholarship provision then had been equally good . // Equality is not only the equal opportunity of the " best to get to the top " . There is also the question of the opportunities for human development for those who do not aspire to obvious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity for development if , for instance , the backward child of a wealthy family can be so educated as to be able to lead a useful , productive and respected life and a similarly backward child from a poor family sinks , through lack of appropriate education , into extreme poverty and perhaps invalidism . There is inequality , similarly , if there are unequal opportunities for the " average " ( whatever that may mean ) and for the handicapped . Slavery does not cease to exist because a few gifted slaves can become free . Privilege does not disappear because some of the formerly oppressed gain privileges . Inequality is bad where people are prevented by reason of socioeconomic or other factors from developing as creative human beings . The problem is not simply whether the " best " person can win the competition for a position of power or prestige , but whether talent is being wasted and frustrated . This may not be a competitive matter at all . In a highly developed economy the position is not that if one person is to lead a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the contrary , the more effectively people can be brought into the productive and co-operative social structure the more they can , in turn , draw others into this structure too . Putting this in practical terms , if there is more produced there is more to spare to help other people to be educated to become productive . And if the education which those people undergo is an education in understanding of human problems as well as of the use of other resources ( e.g. , machinery , minerals , land , capital ) then the structure will be more productive than if the education is heavily weighted on the " scientific " side . I want to stress here this practical side of human studies ( the studies dealing with human personality , thinking , needs , laws , customs etc . These include literature and psychology and anthropology and economics ) . It is in these studies that people learn to break through the narrowness and prejudice of social class and other social groupings , and to come to an understanding of human potentiality . Scientific education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn creates new occupations where the entry qualification is not birth but knowledge . Where knowledge itself remains within reach of some social classes and not others there remains much to be done in releasing human powers and breaking down social barriers . This is where the human studies can contribute . These can help to reconstruct r // society by revealing what human potential is , and where it is located . For example , the discovery that intelligence , as measured by tests , is found throughout all classes of society gave impetus to the more liberal provision of " grammar " or " high " schools ? secondary schools with courses leading to matriculation . This happened when it was found that there was a greater number of bright working-class children than bright children in other classes , even though the proportion ( at the time when these measurements were first carried out ) was lower . This is an example of the way in which human study can reveal social wastage and hasten the provision which reduces the wastage and extends equality . Where there are obvious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can develop these inequalities affect the schooling of the people concerned . Adults who will follow narrow occupations usually receive relatively uneducative schooling . Where working-class occupations are repetitive and uninteresting the children of this class usually have repetitive and uninteresting schooling . Schooling is seen as a preparation for work . As a result , children from educated societies or educated parts of societies are better provided for at school than are those who can not pick up much education from the adult life around them . In our own society , schools are becoming more educative because thinking is increasingly in demand in adult life . The common notion of schooling , rightly or wrongly , has been of a process which , if efficient , will help the pupil to fit into his place in society rather than of society itself as opening out by reason of the contribution of its progressively more and more educated citizens . It is perhaps surprising that what has actually happened is this latter and less expected process , less expected , that is , by the general public . Educational theorists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be improved . The growth of knowledge , in the industrialized countries , has caused a social explosion which is sweeping aside the older patterns of society , of class , of wealth , of power , of political influence and of scope for personal development . The last of these is the most important in our present inquiry , and it is for their implications regarding human growth that the other developments are here significant . In Australia today there is much movement between occupations and into new occupations , and in this movement schooling and other education plays an essential part . It is sometimes contended , however , that schooling helps the middle class rather than others . Such contentions are supported by evidence from the United States and England . An interesting study is recorded in Education and the Working Class by Brian Jackson and Dennis // Marsden ( Penguin Books , 1966 ) . The authors , who themselves proceeded to Cambridge from what they regard as working-class homes , investigated the backgrounds of eighty-eight workingclass children who completed grammar school courses in Huddersfield , Yorkshire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become middle class , a process which took place most successfully if their families already had middle-class connections . The authors , and I agree with them , feel that the schools are not doing as much as they could for society if they are only moving a few gifted members up out of the working class and leaving the mass of the people unchanged . I do not think , however , that this is what is happening in Australia , though the figures given by the Martin Report regarding the social origins of university and teachers ' college students indicate that a disproportionate number of these comes from the higher socio-economic groups . If it is true that schooling is failing to develop ability in the lower economic groups this is a problem against which educators , if they are to help all sections of the population , must contend . I think there is some possibility that the Martin Report 's figures reflect the fairly recent boom in the acquisition of knowledge , and that the better informed parents have had an initial advantage in recognizing the trend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of the school and scholarship provision . The English picture of a small proportion of working class children moving " up " does not now fit the Australian scene very well , though this may have been what happened in the early years of state high schools . It does not fit because , for one thing , we do not have a clearly defined working class . We can , of course , distinguish those who work mostly with their physical strength from those who work mostly with their minds , but this division does not correspond to the economic grading . Again , we could distinguish those who have some capital from those who are spending all they earn , but here again the classification would not correspond to the readily recognizable social groupings . This is because many of what would formerly have been the " working " class now have some capital : they may , for instance , own their houses or be in the process of acquiring them , and they may have money in the bank . What I am here concerned about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one section , and a minority section at that , there is something wrong with the system , since it is supposed to be equally available to all . Sometimes teachers point out with some satisfaction that the children of professors , doctors , lawyers , diplomats and so on are doing very well in their school . It is , in // fact , satisfactory that state schools can provide for all social groups and that they are not an inferior provision for the poor . It is more satisfactory still , however , when teachers can also point out that , along with the children from professional families , there are others who are benefiting from advantages better than those of their parents . It is good that the able children from " nonacademic " homes should be able to mix as equals with those whose education is greatly advanced by their home situation . It is not good when those who receive most education at home form a school elite so that the inequalities of society are reproduced in the school . If this is not to happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this matter . The reason for having a free and compulsory school system is to establish equal opportunity . There is nothing specially " democratic " about providing special advantages at the public expense for people who could pay for them . I think that what is actually happening is not that the schools help the rich more than the poor , or the middle rather than the upper and lower classes , but that the educated parents are able to make better use of the schools , as of other social services . They can find their way through school problems better than other people for the same reason that they can find their way through income tax forms better than others . " Educated " people are not the same as " middle-class " people on an economic grouping ? many educated people are in the upper and lower income groups . There is , however , a tendency to define " middle-class " in a way which equates it with the fairly highly educated . References to " middle-class " attitudes and virtues , for instance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If the middle class is defined , as it sometimes is , as those people with a " middle-class orientation " then it is unlikely to coincide with any other socioeconomic group . I think that the difficulties described in Education and the Working Class and encountered by parents in Huddersfield are greater than those in Australia where school systems are more readily intelligible . The choice of primary school , which appears from this study to have been significant for the child 's progress , rarely arises here . The child 's transition from one stage in schooling to another is usually not determined by parents either , so that the chances of the better informed parents being able to choose schools providing a better educational ladder are remote . We do not have the complications of a choice of universities with varying scholarship provision . The situation where some parents did not know ( though the " middle-class " ones did ) that students can // proceed to Oxford and Cambridge with all expenses paid by scholarships , is unlikely to be paralleled here . As I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better than others , but , on the other hand , our system is not so complicated that it can not be understood , if explained , by the majority of interested pupils and their parents . The complications of the English scene are exemplified by a conversation at which I was present , in which the ten-year-old daughter , attending a grant-aided school , tried to convince her mother , a university lecturer , that some scholarships at her school were not means-tested , and that she was eligible to compete . The child was right , but the mother was not convinced . Schools can not remove the differences in knowledge and interest which children bring with them from home . They can , however , teach in such a way as to make the work relevant to various kinds of people . There is a tendency , unless teachers are careful about this , to relate teaching to the background knowledge of the educated home , and thus to widen the gulf between the pupils already having academic advantages and others . This is often because the teacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of pupil are . One simple way of relating to pupil interests is to refer to local and topical events and not always to books and to other school subjects . To do this the teacher must keep in touch with what is happening around him , and must revise his lessons each time they are given . One is not introducing topical material if the notes used were written last year , or earlier . One of the common diseases of teaching is that it can become rigid and out of date because teachers adhere to the view that the lesson which was once successful is therefore satisfactory and can be indefinitely repeated . The position is worse when what is repeated is not the work of the teacher who uses it , in the case , for instance , when the teacher uses university lecture notes for secondary lessons . This is sometimes done in good faith , by teachers who believe that the university lecturer 's work must be better than their own . It may well be better for its purpose , that is , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undergraduates . The art of teaching , however , lies largely in the relating of material to one 's present audience , not in some intrinsic merit of the presentation out of its context . Lessons should , therefore , be prepared each time they are given , no matter how well the teacher knows the subject matter . There are two ways of looking at schooling . We can see schools as sorting-boxes in which teachers select at each stage the best pupils and advance those as far as possible . This process adds to the advantages of chance and environment and tempera126 Educative Teaching ment which the child has on entering the school . This is , in fact , what often happens , not only in curricular activities , but also in sport , drama , public speaking and various other school activities . People go on being chosen for leading parts because they had them before . Alternatively , we can try to develop latent abilities , to reduce the differences of pupils in so far as these are differences in ability to learn and develop . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the contrary , the more the pupil 's individual thinking is liberated , the more the original and special contribution of that pupil emerges . The thinking of scientists and artists and authors and scholars is diverse , more so than that of people whose creative thinking has never been allowed to develop . NOTE : Of interest in the context of this chapter is Coming of Age in America , by Edgar Z. Friedenborg ( Random House , New York , 1965 ) . Most of the issues discussed in this account of social attitudes of American high school students are relevant to teaching in Australian schools . 14 ? Democracy and Education Plato defined a slave as one who accepts from others the purposes which control his conduct . This condition obtains even when there is no slavery in the legal sense . It is found wherever men are engaged in activity which is socially serviceable , but whose service they do not understand and have no personal interest in. ( p. 98 ) Every expansive era in the history of mankind has coincided with the operation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and classes previously hemmed off from one another . . . . Travel , economic and commercial tendencies have at present gone far to break down external barriers ; to bring peoples and classes into closer and more perceptible connection with one another . It remains for the most part to secure the intellectual and emotional significance of this physical annihilation of space . ( p. 100 ) J. Dewey , Democracy and Education ( New York , Macmillan , 1917 ) . Dewey regarded education as the process which increases communication and the sharing of purposes , which breaks down barriers of class or national exclusiveness , transforming mere collections of people into communities with common aims , and which , ultimately , might create a world community . He did not regard as education the process that imparts skills or knowledge // whereby people may become more efficient slaves , in the sense explained in the first of the passages I have quoted . Education , according to Dewey , is a matter not of acquiring isolated pieces of knowledge , but of understanding the social significance of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " socialization " , a term which was less likely to be misunderstood at the time when Dewey wrote than it is now . He meant that education makes people active participators in social policy , as opposed to being the instruments of policies made by others , and also that education breaks down the isolation of groups " lacking reciprocity of interest " ( p. 99 ) . This isolation , he says , " marks nations in their isolation from one another ; families which seclude their domestic concerns as if they had no connection with a larger life ; schools when separated from the interest of home and community ; the divisions of rich and poor ; learned and unlearned . The essential point is that isolation makes for rigidity and formal institutionalizing of life , for static and selfish ideals within the group . That savage tribes regard aliens and enemies as synonymous is not accidental . It springs from the fact that they have identified their experience with rigid adherence to their past customs . On such a basis it is wholly logical to fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It would certainly occasion reconstruction . It is a commonplace that an alert and expanding mental life depends upon an enlarging range of contact with the physical environment . But the principle applies even more significantly in the field where we are apt to ignore it ? the sphere of social contacts . " ( pp. 99-100 ) Dewey 's point is that an alert and expanding mental life entails new social relationships and that it is hampered by the rigid adherence to past customs which maintains the exclusiveness of social groups . It is not only savage groups who regard " aliens " as enemies . Any firmly established group has some members who resent outsiders and who oppose educational developments which might give other people ideas " above their station " . Investigation usually does have just this effect : it raises the status of some of those who are involved either in the investigation itself or in its practical results , and is a threat to any group owing its status or security merely to inherited position . A striking example of this is the way in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of scientific knowledge to industry ) brought up a middle class which challenged the power of the established aristocracy , this being rapidly followed by the rise of a working class challenging both the others . This challenge consisted not only in the redistribution of wealth , but in the entry of the new classes into the field // of politics , into the formation of social policy . The new classes were not willing to accept from others the purposes controlling their conduct . They were not willing to be prosperous slaves . The removal of political subordination ( " slavery " in Plato 's sense ) is an inevitable result of industrialization . Mechanized industry requires literate workers , and , once people are literate , they can not be forced to confine their literacy to reading technical instructions or to keeping accounts . Once a group of people has acquired this new power , some of them will extend their knowledge in the direction of finding out how the political , administrative , legal and economic system in which they are living works . This is precisely what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain injustices ( i.e. , exclusive features ) in the system , they made it known that these existed . Literacy enabled them both to acquire and to communicate knowledge . It is not true that the mere massing of people together in towns made them politically powerful . There are some districts in Asia which have been crowded for a long time , but , so long as the people in them were ignorant , government remained a mystery , and it appeared useless to try to alter the mysterious power of the privileged . It is usual for privileged groups to increase this sense of mystery , both by claiming divine justification for their privilege and by devising elaborate rituals which confuse the uninitiated . Rituals even in apparently minor matters such as etiquette can help to ward off intruders . Ignorance of such matters at once identifies the newcomer as such and puts the established members of the group on their guard against him . The mere proximity of large numbers of people does not give them political power , but education ? in the sense in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how society works ? does . Education turns unorganized masses into communities . In our civilization it has , within a hundred years , turned a politically powerless working population into members of a democracy , and , for the most part , into members who take that democracy for granted . Over a period of time the instruction which must be given to workers in industry gives rise to education in Dewey 's sense . Dewey , and most other writers on education , have tried to hasten this process as far as possible . They have argued in favour of making schools as educative as possible and have deplored the tendency of schooling to confine itself to instruction rather than to develop thinking . Schools are usually , as a matter of fact , very wary about promoting Dewey 's kind of education , which raises controversial issues , the discussion of which is bound to offend // somebody . It is much safer to teach arithmetic and spelling , which are useful to some people and , at the worst , harmless . Dewey 's recommendations are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as activity methods , involving the introduction into the schools of such activities as weaving , carpentry and cooking , not for the purpose of training people in these trades , but as an introduction to the scientific , geographical and historical connections of these processes . He wanted to show how modern society has grown from the simpler forms of common production , which can be illustrated in schools , to the much more complex forms which can not be so illustrated . It is pertinent to note that in the history of the race the sciences grew gradually out from useful social occupations . Physics developed slowly out of the use of tools and machines . . . . The great advance of electrical science in the last generation was closely associated , as effect and as cause , with the application of electric agencies to means of communication , transportation , lighting of cities and houses , and more economical production of goods . These are social ends , moreover , and if they are too closely associated with notions of private profit , it is not because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deflected to private uses : a fact which puts upon the school the responsibility of restoring their connection , in the mind of the coming generation , with public and social interests . ( pp. 235-6 ) It is the last sentence in this quotation which strikes me as significant . Dewey 's advocacy of practical activities , of making the classroom a place where children will be interested enough to ask questions instead of only being forced to answer them , of bringing out the connection between various branches of knowledge instead of regarding them as rigidly divided " subjects " ? all of these are well known . What is not well known is that throughout Dewey 's writings is this theme of the political influence of education . He uses the word " social " rather than " political " , but he is talking about social change , about the relationships of various social groups , not about fitting into society or how to win friends and influence people . The chapter on education as the force breaking down the isolation of social classes and of nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of making a better sort of society . However , to emphasize this is to draw attention to the fact that Dewey was not altogether satisfied with the state of society , and this aspect of his work is usually overlooked in favour of its less controversial aspects . Present-day Americans , teaching in what is believed to be the tradition of Dewey , do talk a great deal about the " social " aspects of education , but they use this term in an entirely different way , paying a // great deal of attention to the " need " for the child to " adjust himself to society " . Dewey was not talking about adjusting children to society . He was talking about adjusting society . I think that Dewey was mistaken in believing that schools can ever lead the way in assisting social change by social analysis , which is , I think , what he hoped for . I think , however , that he was quite correct in believing that education does lead to this analysis and consequently to reforms . Schooling does assist this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way than that suggested by Dewey . Schooling is nearly always conservative , teachers being encouraged to teach what is generally accepted , or at any rate not objected to , rather than to engage in controversial discussion . Even conservative schooling , however , may be non-conservative in its effects . Nobody has yet devised a way of producing brilliant individuals who can not think . ( A critic of the Soviet Union commented that this was what the regime there required . He meant that it would be convenient for the government of that country to be able to produce able technologists who would accept social policy without questioning it . ) Once people have acquired the means of learning some of them will think on political lines , and apply there the same sort of general method of criticism which they have been trained to use in other fields . For this reason I think it is impossible for a " totalitarian " state to exist for very long . Totalitarianism is only a modern form of tyranny , a form of tyranny in which the propaganda aspects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the literate community to convince people that the tyrant should be supported than is necessary when the mass of the people are ignorant and cut off from sources of information on such matters . if this is so , the Russian system will undergo a great deal of change now that illiteracy has been virtually liquidated . This does not , however , necessarily mean that the international situation will improve as soon as that inside Russia does . It is quite possible to have two competing democracies finding reasons for disliking each other . It may be true that if people were sufficiently well educated they would prefer some means other than war for settling territorial disputes , but it may also be true that it will take a very long time to achieve that degree of education . I think that the connection between democracy and education is that universal education leads to democracy because education itself gives power . This is so , I believe , whether or not we deliberately educate for democracy . To educate for democracy is not to assure people that democracy is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society . The same is true of educating for ai // internationalism . I think any sort of education will assist internationalism in the long run , not by telling people that they ought not to resort to armed force , but by spreading some knowledge of international economic relations and of the nature of international conflict . It seems likely that it will ultimately become known that amicable relationships between nations are profitable to both sides , and that it is not true that one nation can progress only at the expense of others . The study of economics , however , is one that has lagged behind the vocational ones , so it may be some time before there is much general understanding of matters of this kind even in literate countries . And as large sections of the world population are still not literate there is no immediate prospect of world understanding in this very important area of knowledge . I have mentioned that our democracy , our education and our industry have all developed together . They reinforce one another , and are , I think , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of economic structure in which there is a changing balance of power between various social groups , and where the social groups themselves change fairly rapidly . This is what happens with an expanding structure of production . No one group is firmly fixed in a key position so that it can dominate all others , and the changing nature of the groups themselves prevents permanent domination by an alliance of various groups . If for some reason industry ceased to develop , if the structure of production became stable and rigid , so , I think , would the structure of society . Suppose , for example , that some development of automation made it unnecessary , for a very long time , to have literate workers , what would be the effect on society ? I would suggest that one result would be that schooling would become optional , that it would not be provided free of charge by the state , that many people would revert to illiteracy and , with illiteracy , to acceptance of domination by the educated group who would control the economy and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this is at all likely to happen . I think that , on the contrary , the need for unskilled work will decrease and that education will consequently increase . I have raised this fictitious possibility only to illustrate the interdependence of democracy and our sort of structure of production . Education itself is closely connected with the structure of production . I do not think that there is any successful way of imposing democracy on a pre-industrial society , or of persuading people in such a society to adopt democracy . There is nothing very convincing about the machinery of democracy , for instance about // the holding of elections , to attract people into this kind of government . There is not much point in voting if one does not know what one is voting about , and , in any case , contrary to what is generally believed , the ballot box is only a small part of the democratic procedure . We do not usually decide anything very important by voting for one man rather than another . What is important is that the candidates , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in accordance with the feeling of the electorate . This is the reason why the policies put forward at an election generally have a great deal in common . The democratic influence has already taken place . All parties know in a general way what the major demands of the people are . They know whether there is unemployment , or a shortage of certain types of skilled workers , or if pensioners are protesting against undue hardship and so on . These matters are being discussed in the press and elsewhere , and policies grow out of social demands rather than as impositions upon society by its rulers . In a country where there are large numbers of illiterates this is not so . The main feature of democracy , namely communication , is absent . The ballot box is a necessary , but not a sufficient , condition of democracy . One fact which is sometimes misunderstood is that democracy works through organizations rather than through individuals . People who think of democracy in individual terms sometimes wonder whether they are any better off with democracy than they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in several million confers a power so small as to be negligible . This is quite true . The power of the individual in a democracy is imperceptible . It is people in organized groups , not people taken separately , who are influential . A democratic society works not through individuals , and not only through political parties , but through numerous groups associated for various reasons . We have trades unions , professional organizations , employers associations , the churches , Rotary Clubs , sporting associations , the Country Women 's Association , pensioners associations , the Boy Scout Movement , the Arts Council , Junior Farmers and so on . No form of government can make all individuals equally influential , nor , I think , would there be much point in doing so . Any kind of policy , and , I believe , any kind of thinking , is a social matter . People do not produce ideas out of their inner consciousness . It is rather that their consciousness itself is formed in association with other minds . Policies are worked out in action , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guesses by people who happen to think of solutions to this or that isolated problem . A group policy is not just the sum of the contributions of its various // separate members : it is something worked out in co-operation , the various contributions helping to form a new structure . A committee , for instance , does not just get together and record its preconceived ideas . It discusses problems , considers evidence produced by various members , suggestions are made in the light of this evidence and on the basis of other suggestions which are not quite adequate to meet the problem , and gradually a policy is decided on which may not have been that of any one member at the beginning of the meeting , but which has emerged as various facts are made known . The formation of policy is not just a matter of taking votes . It is more one of bringing various pieces of information to bear on a problem . What the committee knows is as important as what it wants . A similar kind of building-up of policy , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the making of political programmes on a larger scale . A democratic society is one in which the power to work out courses of action is diffused through the whole community . I do not think that we can intelligibly ask whether we should educate for democracy . If we really educate , in the sense of promoting thinking , then we do promote democracy . We can , however , have schools for other than democratic purposes . We can have schools which suppress thinking , or which suppress it on certain matters . A school in which it is not permitted to question the assumption that Germans are the master race and should therefore govern the world , or that British public schoolboys have a moral obligation to govern India ( this is not taught now : it was once ) or that the word " un-American " means the same thing as " bad " prevents critical thought in these matters . It may be true that the Germans , British or the Americans are better than other people and that it would be beneficial to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ca n't of course , be true that all of them are the best : only one of these beliefs can be true ) but the uninvestigated assertion of even a true belief is not inquiry . The educative way of dealing with these , or any other beliefs , is to examine the evidence for them , not to assume that only very bad people would even ask for evidence . We suppress thinking in some matters in our schools . This may be necessary , but it is not educative . It is not always possible to educate . We restrict thinking on controversial matters such as politics , religion and sex , usually by refraining from raising such questions at all . This is not the fault of the schools . The community in which the schools exist is not favourably disposed to education , at least in schools , in these matters . Schools can not teach what the adult community will not tolerate . They can not , // therefore , lead the way in the discussion of controversial topics . They can , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , make it possible that their ex-pupils will , as adults , investigate the topics which are forbidden in schools . There are many people who object to the discussion of " dangerous " topics whether in schools or elsewhere . This fact indicates that a democracy can contain many people who do not want democracy for others . A democratic society is precisely one in which all topics can be aired , and erroneous opinions can be shown to be false . It is , I think , only where there is a variety of demands that democracy can exist at all , for the reason that people are not usually tolerant by choice , but only where the absence of toleration will mean suppression of their own particular point of view . Where there is a dominant " correct " view and a minority " dangerous " one the minority is in fact suppressed even if the country doing the suppression is nominally democratic . I am not here discussing whether people ought to be tolerant of opinions they consider dangerous . I am discussing the conditions under which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for instance , in the course of a long series of intolerant occurrences at the end of which one church was in undisputed control of public opinion . It certainly did not result from any specially British belief in leaving other people to decide religious questions for themselves . Far from believing in the principles of democracy , most people in democracies today believe that many other people are so unintelligent or so irresponsible that they ought to be treated as children because they are incapable of making decisions on important matters . Before subscribing to this belief ourselves , however , we might well consider the fact that , had this belief prevailed , most of us would not have become educated . It was believed up to about a hundred years ago that few people except aristocrats and the wealthier commoners had sufficient intelligence to benefit from the sort of education given to the upper class of society . Universities today are full of people whose ancestors were the " labouring poor " , believed to be incapable of sensible thought and expected to become dangerous if given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether all this thinking and discussing and democracy are very desirable anyway . We have not proved that education is desirable by saying that it is an aspect of democracy , or that democracy is desirable by saying that it is an aspect of education . " Democratic " is not a synonym for " good " . " Uneducative " is not a synonym for " bad " . Democracy and education may in // fact be good ( I think they are ) , but this is not self-evident from the meaning of the words . We could argue that people might have more satisfying lives in a stable , unchanging society , with its citizens accepting an established order and going about their work in a traditional way . We could say that the increase in productivity in democratic societies is not necessarily an improvement , since it means among other things an increase in the production of destructive objects which could destroy the civilization that produced them . We could also say , less confidently , that a developing society does not make people any happier since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are satisfied . This point is rather doubtful since most people seem to prefer having the new wants . You could go and live in a cave or in a primitive hut to remove the temptation to want a new car . Few people in fact do this . I think the answer to the contention that it might be better not to promote thinking is that human beings are made with the power of thinking ( with various degrees of efficiency ) , and most of them use this power when the opportunity offers . To argue that people might be happier if they thought as little as possible is perhaps to put the matter in an unreal way , to suggest that they might be happier if they were not human . The history of education ( thinking etc. ) is the history of civilization . Civilization goes on spontaneously , without any deliberate planning or decision as to whether or not it is desirable . I have said that most human beings tend to think " when the opportunity offers " . This statement contains a difficulty as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stimulus to thinking . It might appear that thinking could go on almost anywhere , that it is totally contained in the mind of the thinker , and does not require any special material environment provided the person has the leisure for contemplation . This however , is not confirmed by observation . People kept in solitary confinement do not usually think constructively . Isolation and lack of activity impair mental ability . This suggests that thinking is not a selfcontained activity after all . It is true that some people think better if they are living in retirement and are not called upon to fulfil continual demands from other people . The retirement , however , usually means a good deal of contact with other minds through books , and does not usually mean complete isolation from other human beings or a cessation of physical activity . The " opportunity " for thinking includes some kind of stimulus or challenge . I think that the " challenge " has to be a problem of // some kind which is neither too easy nor too difficult for the person concerned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested . This brings us back to the question of what creates interest , which I can not answer here except by saying that I think it has something to do with personal relationships . Thinking is , I believe , a social activity and not an individual one ; our thinking is interwoven with that of other people . We can approach this problem also by way of considering why civilization arose when and where it did . Why , for instance , was there a high level of thinking in ancient Athens rather than in the Arctic or the tropics or in South America or Britain ? If we could answer this sort of question it would help towards the understanding of what thinking is and therefore what the nature of education is . I think that the answers here are along the same lines as those I have suggested with reference to the stimulus of thinking in individuals ; that is , I think it is a matter of challenge , of being in a situation where problems exist but are not too difficult , where the solution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contact with other people who are interested in the same problems . These considerations have a practical bearing for the teacher . I shall assume that the teacher wants to educate . To educate we must put our pupils in touch with currents of thought which are proceeding in our society so that the school learning is supported by something outside the school . This is where the social nature of learning comes in . We shall not progress very far if , for instance , we try to teach people Greek at school if , outside the school , they are not in contact with people who are interested in Greek or at least in language . Greek has been a very educative study to people in the appropriate social environment . There is nothing wrong with the subject itself , but when it is not supported by other people 's interests it is rejected , forgotten , and not integrated with thinking . The linking of school learning with current topics is usually the easiest way of stimulating learning . When a topic is of current interest in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a matter in which people take an interest , that it is not just a school task imposed for some unknown adult reason . Having established the link with the outside world the teacher can then work back to the less sensational aspects of the topic . I am not suggesting that teaching could well begin from this point . It is true that , by concentrating on current affairs , we could get a kind of teaching which would be very scrappy and superficial , but this need not happen . For instance , at the time when I am writing this // ( February , 1967 ) there is a famine in China . We could use this fact in a superficial way by merely mentioning it and proceeding to the next topic . On the other hand we could make it the introduction to a study of China , discussing the question why famines have been common there , why they are not common in Australia , why China is not a united country which could take measures to prevent famine and poverty in general , what sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a study of the connection between climate and crop production ) , and by what methods , and so on . By this kind of procedure we can educate " for democracy " and " for international understanding " not in the sense of recommending democracy or internationalism but by promoting understanding itself . We are educating for democracy and international understanding if we are really educating at all . The barriers of class prejudice and of national prejudice can be broken down only by knowledge , not by stating that prejudice is a bad thing . Since people do not know what their own prejudices are the condemnation of prejudice does not reduce it . We can reduce prejudice only by reducing ignorance . Since I take " education " to mean the development of understanding , thinking , invention , creativeness , appreciation , judgement and wisdom , I do not regard as progress in education the acquiring of an encyclopaedic knowledge of unrelated facts or the memorization of words or formulae which are not understood . The amassing of information and the memorization of what is not yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not education itself in the sense in which I am using the term . They are , at best , preliminaries to education . I believe that education proceeds by way of emotional processes and that there is no such thing as detached , uninvolved learning . If this supposedly detached learning acquired in an unemotional way did exist , it would mean that some learning proceeds without motive . I think this consideration rules out the possibility of unemotional learning : we know by observation that people do not learn without motive . Consequently they do not learn without feeling . Sometimes the feelings which predominate are not those which some other people share or admire . Some people learn , for instance , from intense competitiveness . Others learn from an intense interest in their subject which many other people can not understand . In each case , however , what we are considering is not unemotional learning , but learning dominated by feelings which some other people fail to observe or to understand , and which perhaps they find peculiar or undesirable . K // Believing as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this takes place when the learner is emotionally involved I think that controversy is one of the most effective methods of classroom teaching . It is not the only way in which involvement can occur . There are other situations in which people are confronted by problems of immediate personal concern . Controversy is , however , one of fairly easily managed methods of teaching . I am discussing , however , the sort of controversy in which people are to some extent at least anxious to solve a problem , and not just to score debating points . Topics which are " controversial " for young children are not usually the same as those which would arouse discussion among older pupils or adults . With young children , too , the scope of discussion is much less and the scope of looking , exploring , investigating is proportionately greater . Young children can not explore very far in words because they do not have the necessary command either of words or of the remembered experience which the words signify . For the same reason , the scope of discussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In my view , then , " opinion " , in the sense of those beliefs about which there is recognized uncertainty in the group discussing them , is inseparable from the educative process . Education proceeds by people trying to find out more about things concerning which they are uncertain and in which they are interested . Far from going on best in an atmosphere of certainty and detachment , education , I think , progresses where there is involvement and doubt . My answer , then , to the question , " flow should the teacher deal with topics which are controversial and where knowledge is uncertain ? " is that the teacher , if he is to educate , should deal with these by raising them frequently if they are topics which the pupils can understand and about which they are concerned . The educator 's problem is not the avoidance of uncertainty , but presentation in such a way as to encourage the pupils to try to discover the truth . This method of teaching is more difficult to manage at first than is the procedure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be reliable . Exposition is easier to prepare than discussion , but , once a class has become accustomed to discussing , to seeking information , to trying to unravel problems , the resultant learning is more rapid and more effective than that which comes from exposition alone , which can result in mechanical reproduction and rapid forgetting . I am not suggesting that once discussion has been established there will be no more exposition . People must still have sources // of information if they are to investigate , and one source will be what the teacher presents . So far as education is concerned , then , the place of uncertainty in the classroom is that there should be a great deal of it . We have , however , other considerations to keep in mind in teaching other than that of what is educational . Some controversy is of intense interest to adults . Many adults are unwilling to have their children influenced by other adults holding views differing from their own in the controversies in which they are interested . Those with strong religious beliefs , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposed to a teacher 's criticism . Patriots are not pleased to have pacificism sympathetically presented to their children . In some ethical matters it is impossible for a teacher to express any opinion without offending someone . In these cases the teacher , if he is to continue teaching at all , must refrain from expressing his own opinion even if he thinks that the best way of stimulating the pupils ' inquiry is to put forward a definite position himself . Except in matters of the most extreme urgency there would be little use in giving an educative lesson if by doing so one removed the possibility of one 's giving any more lessons at all . In matters of public controversy it is sometimes possible to meet the difficulty by having the pupils discuss without the teacher 's expressing an opinion . There are other matters on which feeling is so intense that they can not safely be discussed , within the classroom , even by the pupils . Some of the questions of sexual morality are of this nature , as are some religious questions . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussion of controversial matters or remain impartial while allowing the pupils to take sides depends , apart from the consideration of expediency that I have just mentioned , on what is educative to the particular pupils concerned in the particular situation . In the case of very young or very dependent pupils the expression of the teacher 's opinion often means the end of discussion . His view is taken as authoritative even if he himself is very doubtful about it . In such a case the teacher should , if he wishes the question to be recognized as controversial , refrain from making what will be interpreted as a pronouncement . Where the pupils have more confidence in their own judgement a firmly held and firmly expressed opinion from the teacher may aid the opening up of the topic . The position in university teaching is usually of this kind . Tertiary students are unlikely to respond to an invitation to discuss a question if the lecturer persists in remaining non-committal . At that stage they are unlikely to be intimidated by the lecturer 's not agreeing with them and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be interested , though not convinced by it , to know to what conclusion the lecturer 's studies have led him . Turning now to the question of the distinction , if any , between knowledge and opinion , I think that there is no distinction , and that " knowledge " consists of those opinions which happen to be true . We can never be certain , beyond the possibility of doubt , that any particular opinion is true . We can not be certain beyond the possibility of doubt , but we are in fact certain beyond actual doubt . Few people doubt their own existence , though it is possible to demonstrate that their certainty in this matter could be erroneous . The Socratic distinction between knowledge and opinion depended on an interpretation of the world which need not here concern us . Socrates distinguishes between a world of Forms , or patterns of perfect things , and an imperfect world known through the senses . The world of Forms is , he thinks , known by contemplation which can arrive at certainties , whereas experiences through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not accept this division of reality or of thinking we can accept the notion that the educator is concerned with tracing causal connections , and in this sense with the " intelligible " world ( this is what Socrates called the world of Forms ) , and not with the receiving of isolated impressions . There is a sense in which we can accept the simile of the cave , as presented in the Republic , even if we do not accept the theory of two levels of reality which Socrates intended it to illustrate . We can distinguish between random observation and organized knowledge , between facts known in relationship to other facts and facts known only in isolation . This does not give us any basis for distinguishing certain knowledge from uncertain opinion in the sense that there are two ways of knowing , but it is true that we do often become more firmly convinced of facts , and more confident in remembering them , when we can place them in a context . We can distinguish between facts known in some of their relationships , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We can not distinguish knowledge from opinion except in the sense that we feel more certain about some things than about others , that uncertainty can provide a growing point for thinking , and can be used by the teacher to stimulate thinking , that discussion of topics which are controversial to adults can be educative , especially to adolescents , but that it is sometimes necessary , on grounds of expedience , to neglect this sort of opportunity for educating . It may be necessary for the teacher to remain detached from a controversy when teaching young or backward pupils who are very readily influenced , and regard the teacher as an // authority . With older , more able , or more confident pupils , however , the teacher 's strongly held conviction can be the stimulus to lively thinking . Children are sometimes given exercises in distinguishing " fact " and " opinion " in newspaper reports and elsewhere . What they are asked to classify as " opinion " is usually the material which indicates the feelings or attitudes of the speaker or writer towards certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only describe the happenings themselves . The " opinion " here is what is sometimes called " emotionally toned language " . On this basis it is a statement of " fact " to say that Mr Holt was Prime Minister of Australia , but of " opinion " to say that he was a competent prime minister . " Opinions " in this sense are indications of likes and dislikes , of support or rejection . The " facts " are not indubitable statements , but impersonal statements . This way of distinguishing " fact " and " opinion " can lead to some classification at variance with ordinary usage . For instance , " Captain Cook came to Australia in 1066 " would be " fact " , even though false , and " I like oranges " would be " opinion " even though nobody doubts its truth . There is nothing wrong with this kind of exercise , but I think that it might be clearer if the statements were classified as " personal " and " impersonal " instead of as " opinion " and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good exercise in the analysis of propaganda statements , such as those of advertisements , where preference statements are often put forward as if they were impersonal ones . The statement , for instance , that a certain brand of cigarette is " the best of them all " is a preference statement . It is a statement about somebody 's feelings regarding the cigarettes , not about the cigarettes themselves . This kind of exercise , sometimes given in social studies and sometimes in English , is not relevant to the questions of " knowledge " and " opinion " as I have used these terms . I have mentioned this different usage of " opinion " to clarify the position , since there can be confusion over such a statement as " that is only your opinion " unless it is clear in which sense " opinion " is being used . In Education and Leadership ( London , Harrap , 1951 ) Eric James supported the selection of intelligent children for education in special secondary schools on the ground that the leaders in our society come from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should receive special attention since their future work will be of great social importance . He does not suggest that this group should be specially educated in leadership as such , but that their general education should be of the best quality available . // James , at the time of writing , was the head of Manchester Grammar School , ' a large and very successful selective school . He was writing under English conditions , these being somewhat different from those in our society , so it is possible that his support of the selective school applies to such a school in a society where class differences are more marked than in our own . However , it is unlikely that anyone would question the general theme of James 's book , namely that our society needs well educated leaders . It might be questioned whether the best way of educating them is to make a selection at the age of eleven , when the abilities of some children are not strongly developed and when , therefore , errors of selection are common . In fact , some English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intention of preventing the wastage of ability which , it was felt by some observers , was resulting from the process of selection . The intention in establishing such schools is not , as is sometimes believed , to bring everyone down to the same level or to prevent the development of special abilities . They are being set up in the belief that it is premature selection that prevents the best development of abilities . Selection , in the sense that the pupils with academic abilities and interests tend to come to the top of their classes goes on all the time in the ordinary course of schooling . This sort of selection is more reliable , not less , than the kind that is effected by special tests given in a short period of time . It is perhaps necessary to stress this point , in view of the mystery which , for the general public , surrounds " intelligence " and other factors measured by tests devised by psychologists . The intelligence test is a quick , and less accurate , way of discovering the facts which come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ordinary teaching . It is not a test of ability rather than of performance . Any test is a test of performance . The test material is selected with the intention of including material which all children in the tested groups have an equal opportunity of learning . The opportunities are not in fact absolutely equal . Any verbal test , for instance , can be done more easily by children with a good vocabulary than by those whose vocabulary is limited or is in any way unusual . A family that speaks in " good English " produces children whose vocabulary is better than that of children who commonly hear and use uneducated speech at home . Newly arrived migrant children are obviously at a disadvantage with the tests commonly used . Aboriginal children , again , usually have so different a background that the assumptions made in devising // tests for white children clearly can not apply to them . Special nonverbal intelligence tests have been devised , but here again there are variations in experience which could affect the result . A nonverbal test , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which does depend very largely on verbal ability . None of this is an argument against the use of intelligence tests . They are useful when people know how to interpret them . There is , however , no ground for the belief that there is some " scientific " way of determining how a child 's abilities will develop . The position is simply that children who do well in intelligence tests usually , but not invariably , do better at school than those whose scores are not so high . The notion that some children are working " below " or " above " their ability is based on a misapprehension of the nature of the test results . A child with a high I.Q. and a poor subsequent school record is developing differently from others with a similar I.Q. That is all we can say in the absence of further information about the case . The fact that some children appear to be working " above their ability " casts doubt on the notion of the tests as measures of some kind of ability that can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that some people are not using all the ability they have , or that they are not using it for their school work , but does it make sense to assert that they are using more ability than they have ? When a girl with an I.Q. too low for admission to a high school offering a fiveyear course subsequently passes the Leaving Certificate , has she used more ability than she possesses ? Intellectual ability develops in particular directions in particular situations . It is not something innate in a fixed form and only waiting to be used . " Leadership " , too , develops in particular situations and is , in fact , more a relationship between the members of a group than a special quality of any of them . A person who is a leader in one kind of group is not necessarily a leader in a group of a different sort . The leader in a team of scientific research workers is not necessarily suited to political leadership . As James points out , it is a common characteristic of leaders in various fields in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is not surprising when we consider that most positions of " leadership " in our society involve administration , and that this requires the interpretation of documents and hence the verbal ability which is an important factor in the tests of intelligence generally used . It does not follow , of course , that because leaders are intelligent all intelligent people will be leaders , or even // that they have some qualities of leadership which may or may not be exercised . It is difficult , in a democratic society , to define exactly what leadership is . I think we usually regard as leaders those who are in the public eye . However , the publicist of a movement is rarely its initiator , and often the initiators do their work in obscurity , without being given any recognition as " leaders " at all . I think we get an entirely false view of leadership if we regard the " leader " ( that is , the well-known person who makes speeches and is interviewed by the press ) as someone who has thought of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Leaders " are usually the promoters of policies already fairly well established , for the obvious reason that we do not usually hear about any sort of movement until there are a good many people involved in it . Until then , it is not important enough to get into the news . We do not hear about scientific research projects , for instance , at the point at which they are begun , at the point when perhaps nothing much will come of them . We hear about them when they are successful and when some practical application is under way . Some of the opinions now being expressed by " top educationists " , views which are regarded as " new " by the general public , have in fact been current among professional educators for a very long time . Most of the ideas referred to as " progressive " , for instance , stem from Dewey , who was expressing such ideas at the turn of the century . In a democratic society the policies of " leaders " usually are formed gradually by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the movement rather than being put forward by an individual who somehow becomes a " leader " by reason of some mysterious personal qualities that inspire others to follow him . The leader does usually have special personal qualities , but there is nothing mysterious about them . He is the person who , sharing the interests of the group , is more active , more able and more willing than the others , and who undertakes the arduous and often unpleasant work of putting the policy of the group before the public . In a backward country the leader is one of a group with " progressive " ideas , which he tries to persuade the less progressive part of his society to follow . The progressive policy is usually in fact that of some other kind of society , at present either that of the " western " nations or of the Soviet Union . The leaders are those who have become involved in this other way of life and who want to extend it to their own country . Here , again , the leader is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sense // that it is new to a considerable section of his own people . For instance , a person who wishes to bring democracy to Indonesia is not advocating a new policy , though his ideas may seem quite revolutionary to the more primitive Indonesians . The leader is , I think , somebody who is involved in a movement and who is particularly active in promoting it , rather than somebody who creates a movement . Society develops through the emergence of ways of life ( which usually are related to ways of production ) rather than by the influence of detached individuals . Individuals contribute in various ways to social movements , but do not make them . The leader who for some reason changes his policy so that it diverges from that of the group he is leading does not carry the group with him . The group finds another leader . If , for instance , the Prime Minister became a communist , or the Archbishop of Canterbury an atheist , this would not mean that a considerable proportion of the populations of Australia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain leaders only so long as they are leading in the direction in which their followers are moving . An important point brought out by Eric James 's book is that it emphasizes the notion that leaders should be drawn from all sections of the community on the basis of intelligence . This is the idea which Plato put forward in the Republic , but which has never so far been implemented . Government has never been carried on by people selected by ability from the whole population . Until the present century it has always been the province of the ruling class , whose interests the leaders have put forward . That those interests have sometimes been benevolent does not alter the general pattern . Leaders were drawn from a class whose ruling function was hereditary , not from society in general . At present we are moving , more rapidly , I think , in Australia than in England , though the movement is in progress there , to a selection by ability , particularly by the ability to pass examinations . I recently heard the comment that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their way to the top by the means whereby Aneurin Bevan and Benjamin Chifley progressed , that is , from the coal mines and the railways . Such people in future will make their way through the secondary schools and universities , perhaps taking good degrees in law , and thence go into politics . I think that we are entering a phase in which there will be an educational ladder to leadership and that it will be difficult or impossible to reach leadership positions except by way of this ladder . What I am less certain about is what sort of interests will be promoted by people who have reached their // leading positions in this way . If , as I think , leaders are the exponents of group policies , what groups will form the policies which the leaders by examination qualifications will implement ? Even if leadership positions are available only to those who have achieved academic success this does not , I think , preclude the possibility that some social classes will have more influence on leadership than others . Economic privilege could secure better schooling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privileged classes would be more likely than others to achieve academic success . I think this is to some extent true in England at present . The schools available to those who can pay substantial fees are , on the whole , better than other schools . There are exceptions to this . There are good schools other than the independent ones , but I think that the people who can pay the fees at good independent schools are more certain that their children will receive the sort of education which will lead to the professions than are other people . The position is not , of course , that all schools for fee-payers are good , but rather that there is a group of very successful independent schools and that there are advantages , academic advantages , to be gained by attending them . It is not , as is popularly supposed in Australia , simply a matter of snobbery , prestige , influence and so on . English " public " schools are very good at preparing candidates for examinations . If they were merely good at giving people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there would be any real problem . If there is equality of educational opportunity it does not matter very much if some people have mistaken ideas about superiority . The problem is that really good education is in fact more readily available to some classes than to others . This , I think , is less true in Australia where the standard of academic work is more even as between various kinds of schools . While I think it is true that the standard of schooling in Australia is more even , there is still social inequality in education . Equal opportunities in schooling itself can be , and I think in our society still are , accompanied by inequalities in the ability to avail oneself of that schooling . The home attitude to schooling is important here . Variations in home background have a good deal to do with variations in school success , though it should be noted that these variations are perhaps more in the matter of the home 's acceptance of schooling than in anything else . It is not so much that people are debarred by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do not want it because they come from a home where schooling is not greatly valued . I am not sure // what the position will be in the near future when , I think , schooling will be more generally valued than it has been so far . I doubt whether there is , at present , much academic advantage to be gained by attending a non-state school , but I am not certain that this will continue . We could have a situation where private funds found their way in great quantities into non-state schools for promoting all branches of education , thus creating special advantages for this type of school . It is also possible , of course , that an improvement of facilities in non-state schools will stimulate public opinion to make the money available for improvements in public education which those associated with public education have advocated for some time . I do not know how this situation will develop , but I am sure that the way in which it develops will determine the personnel of our leadership . Leaders will come from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of schooling . If we wish to preserve the democratic tradition which many Australians value highly then we shall have to preserve equality in our educational standards , and , since it will not be possible to prevent the standards in private schools from going up , this will necessitate the raising of standards in other schools . If , on the other hand , we like a stratified society , hereditarily stratified , that is , then presumably we shall be in favour of better education in schools charging high fees , and the minimum amount of education elsewhere . I can see no advantages at all in economic stratification , but I understand that there are peope who do , and that their reasons are not always frivolous or selfish . I think that we have moved away from the kind of society in which hereditary status alone ensured leadership , both in the sense in which the " leader " is the spokesman for the dominant movement and in that in which the " leaders " are the whole group of policy-makers , whether they are well-known public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from educated people . What is not certain is where the educated people will come from . PART II THE CLASSROOM 15 ? The First Lesson The immediate problem of the beginning teacher is to keep class orderly and quiet enough to hear the teacher and to a disturbing other people . The next is to teach them something the sense of getting them to perform satisfactorily in such t and examinations as the school prescribes . Sometimes it seem , the teacher , particularly to the one who is taking charge of class for the first time , that any further considerations of conc for the pupils , or about whether they are being educated rat than instructed , or whether what they are learning is relevan the rest of their lives , must wait until the more immediate pi lems have been solved . In fact , however , the problems of con will be overcome more quickly if educative teaching of some k begins almost immediately . This does not mean , of course , that procedures which have been educative somewhere are equ suitable for making preliminary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if the class can be got to work quickly so that t can feel that they are progressing with something important i much easier to maintain order than if the teacher appears to pupils to be filling in time or giving an introduction to the sub he is going to teach rather than teaching it . This is sometimes overlooked by teachers who advise the beginner to forget at " theory " , at any rate till the more obvious difficulties are o ' come . Having the class working with a sense of purpose is most lastingly effective way of overcoming the obvious difficult The difficulties are not always formidable . In some schools tone is such that the teachers , including new ones , are give polite reception and the pupils expect to set to work quickly . important that there should be enough work prepared to k them occupied , because even a co-operative adult audience comes restive if it has nothing to do . It is better to prepare much work than too little . The teacher who has to improvise 149 // front of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this means loss of rapport with the class . A confident manner is important in making contact with the class and gaining co-operation . The class can not work with you if they do not know what you want them to do , and they can not know this unless you know it yourself . This appears obvious , but there are some difficulties which beginners often overlook . You may think you know quite clearly that what you want 2C to do is to write a composition about something they have seen on television , but have you considered whether they have writing materials , whether you want them to use exercise books or loose sheets of paper , whether they are to rule a margin , how long the composition is to be , whether you want an outline written first , whether you are going to supply the spelling as the need arises , and , if not , what you want the pupils to do ( guess ; ask their neighbours ; look words up in the dictionary ? ) and whether everyone has regular access to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps the last , are trivial , but they do not appear so to the class . The teacher 's confidence depends very much on being prepared to lay down details of procedure , and this should be done very clearly and deliberately . One way to lose control is to speak quickly and to give instructions to individual pupils in asides which many people do not hear . It is also advisable to avoid unnecessary comments , as these distract attention from the work . A nervous teacher sometimes keeps talking with a feeling that while he does so he is in command of attention and not losing control of the class . It is quite possible , however , to keep control where people are working quietly by merely watching and speaking only where necessary . A common mistake is to speak to the class while pupils are speaking to one another . This has the effect that they acquire the habit of not attending . There is no reason why , in many lessons , there should not be talking , but it is advisable to make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others , and to make absolutely clear which times those are . There must be a loss of rapport if people are not prevented from speaking and then reprimanded or otherwise punished because the teacher , without indicating that this is so , now wants silence . Threats and punishments may assist control , but they can not be the major part of it , because repressive control works only so long as there is not much of it . Discipline depends mainly on the working procedure of the class . It is more effective to aim at getting the class working than at keeping it quiet . If we regard discipline mainly as preventing something , then discipline will be
