A swarm of mosquitoes may create a noise like thunder . <P> - Old Chinese Saying <P> It had been predicted for nearly three months , and for the past two weeks U.S. seismologists had kept their ears to the ground in hopes of catching the faint tremor . High-flying U-2 reconnaissance jets , mounted with fallout-collecting air scoops , stood ready along the shores of Asia to fly at a moment 's notice . Then , sure enough , another mushroom cloud rose slowly into the skies over Lop Nor in China 's harsh Takla Makan Desert . <P> Hardly a Surprise . Peking 's second nuclear explosion was a bit bigger than its first of seven months ago . It came on with at least 20 kilotons or , roughly , the same amount of destructive power carried by the Hiroshima bomb*-but it would be days before an analysis of its slowly spreading fallout would tell if the Chinese had advanced the state of their nuclear art . In any event , the blast was hardly a surprise-or a new reason for fear . Said Soviet Premier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threat of nuclear war now . " <P> His guest in the Kremlin , India 's Prime Minister Lai Bahadur Shastri , was cooler still . " We were expecting it even earlier , " Shastri remarked . <P> Even before the explosion , Peking had continued its increasingly aggressive stance over the " imperialist threat " in Viet Nam . In a Red Flag editorial that scored the U.S. and Russia with equal ferocity , Army Chief of Staff Lo Juiching described Lyndon Johnson as ' ' more insidious and deadly than Hitler " and stomped with his other foot at the Soviets for their reluctance to engage in full involvement in Southeast Asia . " Whoever wants to satisfy his greed at the expense of others , " wrote Lo , " is lifting a rock that will inevitably fall on his own toes . " <P> " No Real Risks . " To back up Lo 's bluster , Red China passed the word that its 200 million-man ( and woman ) militia had gone into serious training . The mainland press reported shrilly that units on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; men and women in blue boiler suits marched briskly through Peking streets with rifles slung . <P> One Peking factory even altered its assembly line to produce Chinese lantern slides branding the U.S. as the " aggressor . " And word filtered out that rail traffic between Peking , Shanghai and Canton had been disrupted-perhaps due to troop or supply movements to the Southeast Asian border . <P> Or perhaps due to Chinese design . As well as anyone in the West , Peking knows the value of psychological warfare . But the Chinese would be foolish to commit themselves to a major ground war against the U.S. at this time . Said one Asia expert : " The benefits to China would be nil ; they are now getting all of the advantages from Viet Nam with no real risks . " And , since it will be at least five years before even the primitive 20-kiloton package exploded at Lop Nor can be delivered onto global targets , it seemed likely that the current Chinese thunder is being generated by nothing more than a swarm of anxious mosquitoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Nuclear Club : U.S. , 341 blasts ; Soviet Union , 127 ; Britain , 24 ; France , 5 ; Red China , 2.
