txt President Kennedy flew back to Washington tonight after having been well received on a one-day tour of the South on which he spoke forthrightly about civil rights . He shook hands and talked about the Birmingham race crisis with defiant Gov . George C. W.allace of Alabama and was nearly mobbed here by Alabamians seeking to shake his hand . Earlier in the day he spoke out on civil rights at a Vanderbilt University convocation at Nashville , Tenn . The efforts of Negroes to secure their rights , he told the Vanderbilt audience , are " in the highest traditions of American freedom . " Debate to Go On He also said that the nation 's " continuing debate about the rights of a portion of its citizens " would continue . Mr. Kennedy 's meeting with Governor Wallace at Muscle Shoals , Ala. , and later on his helicopter , was amicable but not noticeably warm . It produced no agreement on their differing attitudes toward ra cial unrest in Alabama . Last weekend Mr. Kennedy dispatched Federal troops to Alabama ready for intervention in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wallace caused a suit to be filed in the United States Supreme Court contesting the President 's right to make such use of Federal troops . Both Give Their Views On a half-hour helicopter ; flight from Muscle Shoals to Huntsville , Mr. Kennedy and Governor Wallace sat side by side and held what Pierre Salinger , the White House press secretary , called a " not unfriendly discussion " of Birmingham and other racial matters . Another source said that Mr. Kennedy had stated his view . and Governor Wallace had stated his . There was little meeting of minds between them , it was reported . At a news conference later , Governor Wallace confined himself to repeating , several times , ' " We discussed the matter briefly . " He said " the matter " eluded Birmingham but would give no details . It was a friendly conversation , he said . " There is nothing personal in the matter at all , " he added . Most of the conversation with the President , Governor Wal. : lace insisted , was devoted to the beauties of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would be willing to meet Mr. Kennedy again , i ? the President desired . At Muscle Shoals Governor Wallace and Mr. Kennedy greeted'each other cordially . The Governor told , reporters that " we 're glad to have the President of the United States in Alabama . " When Mr. Kennedy got off his helicopter , the Governor shook his hand and the two and others walked about a hundred yards to the chemical engineering building of T.V.A. in front of which the President spoke . After the helicopter trip to Huntsville , Mr. Kennedy rode in a brief motorcade along the airstrip , waving to a crowd of several thousand people . Governor Wallace was not in the car with him , a somewhat unusual situation . At all three of the President 's stops in Tennessee and Alabama , he was greeted by friendly crowds . The police estimated that 150,000 lined Nashville 's streets to see him and that almost 30,000 were gathered in the Vanderbilt Stadium for his speech . After telling the Vanderbilt audience that the debate on civil rights would continue , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard first forged by the nation 's founders has been reached  --  and all American enjoy equal opportunity and liberty under law . " Finds Cause for Alarm Recent events , Mr. Kennedy said , with unmistakable reference to racial violence in Birmingham and Nashville , had been watched " with alarm and dismay " by " the nation , indeed the whole world . " Appealing to the educated citizenry to " respect the rule of law , " he conceded that " no one can deny the complexity of the problems involved in assuring to all our citizens their full rights as Americans . " Nonetheless , the President said , " in these moments of tragic disorder , a special burden rests on the educated men and women of our country to reject the temptations of prejudice and violence , and to reaffirm the valuesof freedom and law on which our society depends . " Men such as the faculty , students and graduates of Vanderbilt , Mr. Kennedy said , know " that law is the adhesive force in the cement of society . " They know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defy ? a law or court order he does nut like is to invite others to defy those which they do not like . leading to a breakdown of all justice and order . " Appeals to the Educated The educated man , Mr. Kennedy said : " Knows , too , that every fellow man is entitled to he regarded with decency and treated with dignity . Any educated citizen who seeks to subvert the law , to suppress freedom , or to subject other human beings ? to acts that are less than human , degrades his heritage , ignores his learning and betrays his obligations . " The President did not mention the unrest in Birmingham , Nashville or elsewhere . But- , . in the context of recent events , there was no mistaking his . meaning , Most of Mr. Kennedy 's remarks at Dudley Field , the Vanderbbilt Football stadium , were devoted to civil rights matters , ' and to his often-issued call for educated men and women to enter the public service . Peripherally , he responded also to critics of his costly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , " see no more reason for landing a man on the moon than the cynics and skeptics of half-a , millennium ago saw Columbus crowing the ocean .
