It does n't sound quite like the blues . The thumb strums a steady one-two beat on the two lowest guitar strings while two fingers play arpeggio melodies on the upper strings . There are no leaning , sliding blue notes , no full chords . The music is light and nimble , and the guitar accompanies the singer 's baritone voice in note-for-note unison : <P> No more potatoes , <P> Frost done killed the vine <P> The blues ai n't nothin ' <P> But a good woman on your mind . <P> The song is C. C. Rider , and the verse expresses the bitterest feelings of its author and singer , a sweet-tempered old man named Mississippi John Hurt . <P> Six months ago , Hurt was home in a farm Avalon , for Miss . $28 a ( pop . 200 ) , month - while working his on wife cooked free for the farmer . <P> Last week he was in Washington holding nightly seminars in country blues at a coffeehouse called The Ontario Place , and he was getting paid $200 a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ espresso in silence : the shy singer-69 years old and only 5 ft. 4 in. tall-is the important rediscovered folk singer to come out of Mississippi 's delta country , the traditional home of country blues singers.and overcast in Birmingham . <P> Hurt is now the grandfather of 17 , but much of his music is a souvenir of his earliest childhood . Having quit school at eight , he learned such songs as Good Morning , Miss Carrie , Salty Dog and Spanish Fandang on the unpainted porch of his family 's sharecropper shack . As he developed his unique guitar style , he invented others - Spike Driver Blues , Candy Man Blues , Cow Hooking Blues . Eager scouts for Okeh Records showed up in 1928 to record Hurt , then left him to tend to his chores for 35 years . Last March a musicologist searched him out once more and talked him into resuming his career . " I thought he was the police , " Hurt remembers . " When he asked me to come up North , I figured if I told him no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him yes . " <P> Hurt came north to sing at the Philadelphia and Newport folk festivals , then went back home to pick cotton for $4 a day . Now he has signed up for concerts this winter in Boston and New York , and settled down to his first regular singing job . Sitting on a black kitchen chair with his old brown fedora crunched down over his eyes , he sings until the sweat runs down his guitar , quietly announcing each song and saying nothing more- except to ask his listeners if he should leave out the slyly spicy lyrics in some of his songs . He is always told no , and then he sings : <P> The rooster said , " Cock-a-doodle-doo . " <P> Richland woman said , " Any do will do . "
