" How strong are your instincts for survival ? " the San Francisco Chronicle asked its readers three weeks ago . " Could you , an average city dweller , exist in the wilderness tomorrow with little more than your bare hands ? " Having raised this nuclear-age question , the Chronicle announced that it was dubbing Outdoors Writer Harvey R. Boyd " The Last Man on Earth " and setting his entire family to a six-week survival test . <P> " Bud " Boyd , a paunchy 41 , his wife Betty , and their children , Susan , 15 , Sharon , 12 , and Bruce , 8 , packed into the wilds of Lower Lipstick Lake , 250 miles north of San Francisco and less than four miles from the ranch house of Boyd 's friend J. D. Proctor . With them they carried salt , an ax , five knives , 50 ft. of nylon rope , toothbrushes , a ball of twine and-for emergencies-a sealed rifle , a flashlight and a first-aid kit . <P> " We Need Food . " By prearrangement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for distribution to the 40-odd papers that had bitten on the Chronicle bait . <P> " Our lean-to is another miserable failure , " noted Boyd on the second day . " We need some kind of food , " he wrote on the third , telling how he fashioned Sharon 's ring into a barbless hook and caught seven trout . Breathlessly , Boyd reported the discovery of a set of deer horns , a hunter 's cache of cooking gear , a squirrel 's cache of nuts-and described a family feast of frogs ' legs provided by his son . <P> Such Swiss Family Robinson stuff had its curiosity value to all but the other morning paper in San Francisco , Hearst 's Examiner , which , while still leading the Chronicle in circulation , 276,692 to 270,285 , views with sour face the Chronicle 's aggressive efforts to catch up . At length , the Examiner could stand no more .

Shells from fresh eggs . Empty cans which once contained spaghetti . Watermelon rinds . July issue of the Reader 's Digest . So much toilet tissue that some of it had been used to start a fire . " The Examiner cautiously refrained from drawing any snide conclusions . But the evening News-Call Bulletin , jointly owned by Hearst and Scripps-Howard , was less kind : " The Examiner published voluminous type and pictures to imply that Boyd was no hero but possibly-just possibly-a hoaxer .

After watching his wife and daughters weaken from malnutrition and dysentery , Bud Boyd had marched out , returned with mounts , Rancher Proctor , the spaghetti , and other restoratives . Then the tenderfeet , after twelve days of roughing it , beelined for the sybaritic comforts of their Mill Valley , Calif @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
