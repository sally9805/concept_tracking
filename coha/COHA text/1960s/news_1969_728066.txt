txt Span the Bering Strait with a bridge to Siberia . Buy Texas . Build fish hatcheries . Hand out $4,000 to each of the 250,000 men , women and children in this state . Those are a few of the projects Alaskans are suggesting as solutions to their state 's big new money problem : How to spend a windfall that could well exceed $1 billion . Alaska may be at least that much richer after today . Today 's the day Alaska sells leases for about 430,000 acres on its oil-rich North Slope . Engineers estimate that the North Slope reservoir , discovered last year in extreme northern Alaska , may contain 10 billion barrels , making it the largest in North America . Alaskan officials will begin opening sealed bids at $ a.m. ( 1 p m . New York time ) here in a municipal auditorium crowded with tense oil company bidders , bankers and other officials . It may take as long as 12 hours to determine all the winning bids . But there 's little doubt that revenues from the sale will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sale of oil leases in the Santa Barbara , Calif. , channel ( a sale now under attack by conservationists because of massive oil leaks last winter from one offshore well ) . Some authoritative estimates of Alaska 's potential revenue go as high as $2 billion . All this is heady stuff for a state that now operates on a $155 million annual budget . The prospect of bulging coffers has everybody a bit goggle-eyed  --  particularly state legislators in Juneau , the capital . Eying the Pork Barrel " The next session of the legislature ought to be something to see , " writes Jess Harris , a state renresentative , as part of a newspaper series on how the money should be spent . " Most legislators will arrive in Juneau next January with high hopes of dipping their hands into the pork barrel . " Mr. Harris favors investing the money and spending the interest on projects like hospitals , schools and roads . " And why not an Alaska State University in Anchorage ? " he suggests , approaching the pork barrel himself . Mr. Harris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a causeway ; in fact , we could use two of them , " he adds . But other legislators see a cornucopia overflowing with pet projects of their own . To State Rep. Irwin Metcalf. the top priority is " a comprehensive fish hatchery program throughout the coastal area of the state to assist in rehabilitating and restoring our diminishing salmon runs . " State Sen. Frank Peratrovich would like to move the state capitol from Juneau to the Mendenhall Glacier , 13 miles away . " This will be the only capitol in the world that will have a glacier in the background , " he exclaims , savoring the thought . Those backers of a bridge to Siberia argue that their idea is n't as wild as it might sound . They assert that the bridge would facilitate trade with the Asian mainland . Few Alaskans share their enthusiasm , however . Still others champion a monorail to the Arctic Circle , pensions for the elderly , property tax relief , water pollution control , low-interest housing loans , vocational schools , elimination of state indebtedness and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the PTA " has been trying " to get its fingers on some of the money , " says a high state official . The Governor 's Plan Meanwhile , the state is indulging in the luxury of not one but two studies of the problem The state administration has hired the Stanford Research Institute , and the legislature is engaging the Brookings Institute . There seems to be growing agreement that Alaska should invest the sale revenues and spend from the interest received , rather than shooting the whole wad at once . That 's the path Gov . Keith Miller plans to follow for the time being , although he thinks Alaska , as an " underdeveloped state , " eventually may have to spend part of the principal on capital projects . Under Alaska law , state surpluses  --  money available but not allocated in the budget - can only be deposited in banks or invested in U.S. Treasury securities . Drawn by the lure of big deposits , U.S. bankers have been beating a path to Juneau in recent months . George A. Morrison , Alaska 's Commissioner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bankers who have been less than enthusiastic about Alaska in the past are busily calling him now . " They want to know how they can help us , " he says . Mr. Morrison says that ' aince June 1 he has been visited by 10 bankers , while averaging two long-distance telephone chats with bankers daily . But most of these efforts were in vain . Gov . Miller has decided to im est most of the revenue in U.S. Treasury securities , which are now yielding between 7 05 ' , and ** rather than bank time deposits , where the top interest rate is only 6.25 ' ; . Between $50 million and $100 million will be deposited in Alaska 's 11 banks , however , partly to meet demands that some of the revenue be plowed back into the Alaskan economy . The governor announced last month that the San Francisco-based Bank of America , the na tion 's largest bank , will manage the investment program . The governor 's wife had some reservations about that choice ; the Bank of America . once refused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To insure that the sale revenues begin earning interest as soon as possible . the bank has chartered a jet to whisk the checks of the winning bidders to New York and other cities with banks on which the checks were drawn . This will expedite the transfer of funds to the Bank of America . perhaps by as early as tomorrow morning . ( Successful bidders must submit a 20 ' , ; down payment and will have 10 days to come up with the remaining SOr . ) The frenetic activity surrounding today 's sale contrasts sharply with the indifference that greeted earlier attempts to sell North Slope leases . In 1963 and 1964 , Alaska leased 960,000 acres of North Slope land for a paltry $8.5 million . Only a handful of companies submitted bids . Recalls Dale Wallington , deputy director of the state agency that will conduct today 's sale : " Most of the rest just sat back and laughed up their sleeves . " Today Alaska gets the last laugh . The value of North Slope leases skyrocketed with the announcements last year of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those earlier sales : Atlantic Richfield Co. and Humble Oil &; Refining Co. , a subsidiary of Standard Oil Co . ( New Jersey ) . " Some of the land we 're putting up now is stuff nobody bid on then , " says Mr. Wallington with a chuckle . Today 's sale will by no means end Alaska 's North Slope bonanza . The state still holds another 800.000 acres for future sales , and under terms of the leases to be sold today . Alaska receives a 12.5 " ; : royalty on production . Mr Wallington 's " horseback guess " is that royalty payments could total as much as $75 million a year by 1976.
