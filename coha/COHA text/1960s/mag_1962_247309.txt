The Russians stirred a lot of worry a few years ago by saturating the Middle and Far East with low-priced books . But the Russians keep running up against a formidable obstacle : a great curiosity for American books . In Egypt 50% of publishers ' lists are books of U.S. origin . In Iran a Persian edition of Dr. Spock 's baby book was hard to get published because the printers kept snitching page proofs to take home to their wives . In other countries the primer style of U.S. textbooks ( often none too popular at home ) is highly esteemed for self-teaching . This vast foreign market is now being tapped by a remarkable enterprise called Franklin Publications . <P> Franklin goes unsung in the U.S. , but is famous in the exotic cities listed on its Manhattan front door : Cairo , Beirut , Baghdad , Tehran . Lahore , Dacca , Kuala Lumpur , Djakarta . In those places , far from Manhattan 's Publishers ' Row , Franklin in ten years has guided the printing of 26,477,800 books in such exotic languages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Malay and Indonesian . <P> Einstein in Arabic . Franklin , fittingly named for Ben , set out in 1952 to be " the ambassador of American publishing " - nonprofit broker for countries hungry for U.S. books . It is headed by Datus C. Smith Jr. , former director of the Princeton University Press , and governed by a board of directors that includes top U.S. publishers , librarians , industrialists and university presidents . <P> Franklin does not operate in a cold war way to push particular books . Instead , its foreign branches , staffed entirely by nationals , report their countries ' desires . Franklin then buys rights from the U.S. publisher ( who usually charges only a nominal fee ) and delivers translations to foreign publishers . Last year the entire operation cost Franklin a mere $1,500,000 , which came from U.S. and private grants and the 10% royalty that foreign publishers pay after a book is put on sale . The net effect is a boost for infant publishing industries in countries that are afflicted with " undercapitalization and unsophistication . " <P> Franklin 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Murrow 's This I Believe , published in Cairo in 1953 . The first edition of 35,000 copies sold out the first day . Franklin has gone on to feed the Middle and Far Eastern appetite for books ranging from Ethan Frome to Gone With the Wind , from The Spirit of St. Louis to The Universe and Dr. Einstein . Ferdinand in Twi . Franklin 's biggest single venture is in Iran , where in 1957 it launched a handsome Golden Book geography . Royalties were so abundant that Franklin turned them into a loan for building a first-rate printing plant in Tehran , staffed by the newly trained graduating class of an orphan asylum . Out of this grew a healthy new Iranian textbook industry . <P> Last week the Ford Foundation gave Franklin $1,000,000 to spur a wealth of new projects , notably the creation of a one-volume encyclopedia , slated for translation into five languages . The work is slow , since each version has to add local lore about flora , history and religion . But the promise is big , since few of the countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ford money , Franklin is also thinking about untapped markets from Spanish-speaking Latin America to French-speaking West Africa . Soon due for Africa : a first edition of Ferdinand the Bull in Ewe , Fanti and Twi.
