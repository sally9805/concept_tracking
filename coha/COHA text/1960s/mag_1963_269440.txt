To all outward appearances , South Korea 's ruling military junta has wielded iron-fisted control over the country since it seized power in a lightning coup nearly two years ago . Under Strongman General Park Chung Hee , the government stifled all opposition ; newspapers were gagged , and 4,000 known political opponents of the regime were forbidden to criticize it in public . But Park has been less successful in quelling disaffection within his own junta . Last week the wrangling was out in the open , threatening to plunge South Korea into yet another full-scale crisis . <P> Snooper Boss . Park 's generals became openly restive soon after his decision to restore civilian political rule ( TIME , Dec. 28 ) , at least in name . In fact , junta members planned merely to swap their khaki for mufti and continue to run the country ; Park himself was the leading candidate for the presidency . This pleasant prospect was shattered last January when Brigadier General Kim Chong Pil , husband of Park 's niece and boss of the dreaded Central Intelligence Agency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the regime 's civilian political organization , the Democratic-Republican Party . With Park 's tacit approval , Kim , whose 30,000 snoopers had kept tabs on anything and anyone the junta might distrust-including members of the junta-infiltrated the party 's power positions with 1,200 of his former C.I.A . agents . <P> Junta members objected to Kim 's power grab as a blatant attempt to cut them out of the lion 's share of the spoils . When they insisted that Park fire Kim from the party leadership , Park retaliated by sacking four of Kim 's bitterest foes from the junta . But the four , all high-ranking officers , threatened to plunge South Korea into civil war unless Park brought Kim to heel . " The entire army is against you , " one officer told Park . " You can not win . " <P> Failed Objective . Park finally capitulated . He forced Kim to resign his party post , last week sent him on a 50-day foreign inspection trip as his " ambassador plenipotentiary . " No sooner had Kim left than investigators began exploring rumors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a stock market killing and to mulct kickbacks from government contractors . Before 3,000 screaming politicians in Seoul 's Citizens Hall , Park announced grimly that he was bowing out of the presidential race . " I can not help admitting . " he said , " that the revolutionary government has failed completely in achieving its political objective-the emergence of new political personalities . " <P> Certainly . Park 's withdrawal and Kim 's fall from grace failed to turn up any promising new political leaders . The junta-controlled Democratic-Republican Party is in floundering disarray , while the three other major civilian parties , which are also riven by internal dissension , lack any broad base of popular support . Thus , few South Koreans expect that Park will remain long in the wings . With inflation rampant and unemployment at a record high , man ) ' politicians suspect that Park is deliberately saddling them with chaos , that in his own good time , he may once again " save " the country .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
