To merchant builders , who buy land by the tract and sow it with houses , architecture is usually something to do without . Architects , they feel , are too prone to run up costs with perfectionists ' details , and too preoccupied with niceties that are wasted on development customers , who do n't care much what a house looks like so long as there are plenty of appliances in the kitchen . <P> A notable breakthrough has been made in this architect-builder standoff , and made by one of the top builders in the U.S. - California 's Ross William Cortese , who is discovering that architecture is not only selling his buildings but cutting his costs . <P> Privacy &; Chats . Builder Cortese ( rhymes with daisy ) specializes in retirement housing . When he was cranking up for his third retirement community-at Walnut Creek in the San Francisco Bay area-he decided to give an architect a crack at it . The result has made $250 million Walnut Creek , now abuilding , one of the most talked-about developments in the U.S. <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coast 's well-known Warren Callister . " We 've been selling everything else in these retirement projects , " he told him . " Now we want to try selling architecture . " <P> Callister delivered it . Walnut Creek 's roofs lift the eye , its patios are big enough to let the sun in , instead of being the penumbral little fakes so beloved of corner-cutting contractors . And there is no scamping of the invisible details . Air-conditioning ducts are oversized to eliminate duct noise , water pipes are oversized to eliminate water moaning , walls and ceilings are fully insulated , and almost every partition is a floor-to-ceiling storage wall . Doorways are 36 in. wide to permit easy passage of wheelchairs , wall plugs are 2 ft. off the floor to minimize stooping , light switches are at fingertip height , about 30 in. off the floor for effortless flipping by an arthritic arm . <P> More subtle is the Callister-Cortese planning for easy sociability . Gardens are planted around the laundry rooms , for example , so that women with no clothes to wash may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoying the view and a chat . Walkways are planned with many corners for accidental meetings , and there is a gazebo , where free coffee and tea are served . " People want some privacy but not all the time , " says Callister . " They want action and legitimate excuses to meet each other - so we have all these clubhouses and courtyards and meeting rooms . " <P> More Excitement Ahead . Having taken a chance on architecture , Cortese was pleased to discover that he had more than he had bargained for . " Callister helped us get lower costs than we could have got without him , " says the project manager . <P> Callister sees the future of architecture in developments . " I do n't think people are going to buy the old-fashioned homesteads any more , " he says . " They 're going to buy the projects that provide the greatest excitement , activity and adventure . When architecture provides that , it lives . "                 @ @ @ @
