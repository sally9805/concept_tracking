Adlai Stevenson paused patiently time and again while scattered hecklers hoo ed and booed during his United Nations Day speech in Dallas ' Memorial Auditorium Theater last week . When one crude superpatriot interrupted to shout a question about Stevenson 's beliefs , Adlai , unruffled , replied : " I believe in the forgiveness of sin and the redemption of ignorance . " <P> When he left the auditorium , a jeering flock of pickets swarmed around him . Many lugged anti-U.N. and anti-Adlai signs . The crowd began to jostle Stevenson-and a woman clunked him on the side of his head with a card board sign that said " Down with the U.N . " Startled , Stevenson called out to policemen who moved in to collar the female , " Wait a minute . I want to talk to her . " <P> <P> He walked over to Mrs. Cora Frederickson , 47 , and asked : " What is wrong ? What do you want ? " Mrs. Frederickson did not make much sense : <P> " Why are you like you are ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what 's wrong , I do n't know why . Everybody else does . " Adlai decided not to pursue the subject , advised Mrs. Frederickson , " Well , just do n't hit anybody . " Stevenson then moved through the yelping pickets and headed toward his car . A young man spat on him . A policeman moved in to arrest him , and the fellow spat on him too . Stevenson kept moving , climbed into a car and left Dallas ' adult delinquents behind . <P> Dallas was shocked . Wrote the Dallas Times Herald in a Page One editorial : " Dallas has been disgraced . There is no other way to view the storm-trooper actions of last night 's frightening attack on Adlai Stevenson . " Texas Governor John Connally called the affair " an affront to common courtesy and decency . " And Mayor Earle Cabell pointed out that the demonstrators were " not our kind of folks . " <P> Amid the furor , Adlai Stevenson seemed the least perturbed of all , calmly turned the other cheek and said of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to jail . I want to send them to school . "
