In eight seasons with the San Francisco Giants , Orlando Cepeda batted .308 , belted 223 homers , drove in 752 runs-and took more abuse from his managers than any other player in baseball . Bill Rigney called him " a little boy , to whom winning a pennant is n't as important as it ought to be . " Alvin Dark complained that Cepeda had " more minuses than pluses . " Herman Franks said he was " lazy " and " a faker , " publicly accused him of malingering when he was crippled by a knee injury that hampered him for two years and finally required surgery . Last year Cepeda demanded to be traded . The Giants obligingly shipped him to the St. Louis Cardinals in exchange for a pitcher who had won only six games and lost 15 the season before . <P> At first , Cepeda 's reception in St. Louis was cool . " The other players were not too sure about me , " he says . " From everything they had heard , I was temperamental , bad for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had to prove myself , to myself and to the other players . I had to prove that everything they wrote and said about me in San Francisco was wrong . " <P> This season Cepeda batted .325 , clouted 25 homers and drove in 111 runs-tops in the National League . He also appointed himself a sort of team psychiatrist-playing cha-cha records in the clubhouse to dispel the gloom after losses , leading the club in cheers after each St. Louis victory . His enthusiasm was catching-and his bat did the rest . Picked by experts and oddsmakers to finish no better than fifth , the Cardinals ran away with the National League pennant , went on to beat the Boston Red Sox in seven games in the World Series . Last week Cepeda 's contribution got the recognition it deserved . He became the first man in history to win unanimous selection as the National League 's Most Valuable Player .
