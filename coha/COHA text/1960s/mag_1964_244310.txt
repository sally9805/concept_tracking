One reason why many Americans opt for vacations abroad is that almost 10% of the better U.S. hotels do not admit Jews . In the winter resorts of Florida and Arizona alone , there are 80 hotels that exclude Jewish-or Jewish-looking guests ; 22 of them are in one city , Fort Lauderdale , Fla . Nonetheless , B'nai B'rith 's Anti-Defamation League reported at its 51st annual meeting in Manhattan last week that there has been a dramatic retreat from discriminatory practices over the past six years . Some 60% of the U.S. hotels that overtly excluded Jews in 1957 have now dropped such barriers . In New York State the league found only one " restricted " hotel , in the Adirondacks . Even in Florida and Arizona their ranks have been almost halved . Why ? Legal action and educational campaigns have had a liberalizing influence , said the league 's chairman , Moviemogul Dore Schary , but the main reason for the thaw is probably " plain old economics .
