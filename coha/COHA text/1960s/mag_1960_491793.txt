I SawWhat Makes Communism Work CONCLUSION By STEWART ALSOP There are all sorts of surprises awaiting the American traveler in the Communist countries of Eastern Europe . In Budapest , for example , where teen-age boys were tossing Molotov cocktails at Russian tanks less than four years ago , all teen-agers are now passionately collecting matchbook covers . In Bulgaria everybody wags his head sideways for " yes , " and up and down for - no . " Everywhere in Communist Europe the ladies of easy virtue dye their hair precisely the same shade of lemon yellow , as a badge of their profession . In certain " luxury hotels " of Eastern Europe , squads of maids comb out the tassels of the rugs with men 's com bs every d a y ? the tassels are then covered with newspapers , which spoil the intended effect of luxury . But the biggest surprise for an American is to find out how much he is liked , just because he is an American . Everyone remembers the wildly enthusiastic reception which the Poles gave Vice President Richard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the U.S.S.R. last summer . When Rowland Evans , of the New lark Herald Tribune , and I took a recent long automobile tour through Eastern Europe , we had the same pleasing experience on a very much smaller scale in scores of villages , from Poland right around through southern Yugoslavia . The routine was always the same . We would stop at a village in our rented German car to ask directions or to buy some cheese or wine , or just because the village was especially pretty , or because there was a wedding going on , which was surprisingly often . At first , because of our car , we would be treated with a certain reserve  --  the Germans are disliked everywhere in Eastern Europe , and in Poland they are hated with a blind hatred . Then someone would notice the American Hags pasted on the windshield  --  the stars were always carefully counted to see if there were fifty  --  or conversation would establish that we were Americans . Instantly a crowd would begin to gather , gabbling excitedly . I would take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crowd almost always dubbed the " Aincricanski Sputnik " ? and a near riot would ensue with everybody excitedly demanding pictures . After a few more pictures , as likely as not someone would bring out a bottle of wine , or a bottle of plum or apricot brandy ; there would be toasts all round , and we would depart in a rosy glow of mutual friendship and admiration . On a good many occasions Evans , an ebullient fellow , was carried away to the extent of making a brief political speech , keyed to the slogan " Vote American . " The speech , though rarely understood , was always very well received . I am confident that Evans could have been elected mayor by acclamation at all the villages which he was moved to address . Once in a long while , to be sure , some character with " cop " written all over him would show up , and the crowd would disperse with a " Who , me ? " expression on everybody 's face . But that happened very rarely  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was something oddly moving in the repeated discovery that we were so well liked in these Communist countries just because we were Americans  --  a discovery rarely made by Americans traveling abroad in recent years . The reasons Americans are liked in Eastern Europe arc not entirely rational reasons  --  indeed , especially in Hungary , there are wholly rational reasons for disliking Americans . But we Americans are liked all the same , even in Hungary , and essentially because we are not Russians . To put it another way we are , in a symbolic sense , everything the Russians are not , and that is sufficient reason to love us . Almost anywhere in Eastern Europe it is easy enough to sec why the people of the Soviet satellite countries like Americans because they are not Russians . On the long drives I sometimes amused myself with a little game . British left-wing intellectuals arc fond of complaining that Britain has been transformed into a mere colony of the United States ; that the vulgar and repugnant " American way of life " has been imposed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to imagine that the United States had actually had both the desire and the power to impose its way of life on Britain , in the same way that Russia has imposed its way of life on the countries of Eastern Europe . What would Britain be like then ? In the first place , of course , a British president , a faithful stooge of the American Government , would have replaced both the sovereign and the prime minister . The American ambassador would be accorded pride of place at any gathering , and the British president would consult him before any important move . All American political customs would bedutifully reproduced , right down to whistle-stopping and " spontaneous demonstrations " for presidential candidates , just as such Russian customs as wall newspapers and rhythmic clapping arc reproduced in the satellites . British schools would teach precisely what American schools teach  --  with , of course , special emphasis on American history , of which even highly educated Britons are smugly ignorant . And American domination of Britain would be publicly advertised in all sorts of other remarkably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be named The George Washington Steel Works or The Warren Gat/label Harding Textile Factory , and they would display such signs as WE GIVE THANKS TO THE GREAT UNITED STATES FOR THIS FACTORY . Along the roadside would be other signs : LONG LIVE THE GREAT AMERICAN REPUBLICAN PARTY , Or OUR FRIENDSHIP WITH THE UNITED STATES IS AS NECESSARY TO US AS THE AIR WE BREATHE . As 1 say , the thought gave me a certain wry amusement  --  the more so because the British intellectuals who complain of Americanization are the very same pen-plc who are always ready to justify the total Soviet domination of half of Europe as motivated wholly by quite reasonable considerations of self-defense . Even so , the analogy seems to me to have a certain real political meaning . For suppose it were true . What then ? The question almost answers itself . There would , no doubt , be some Britons ready to make the best of the situation , or even to profit by it . But the vast majority would detest all Americans and all America 's stooges . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , and however feeble and necessitous the British , in one way or another in the long reach of history  --  by blood and terror or by the slow erosion of time  --  the attempt to remake Britain totally in the American image would fail . That suggests one of the conclusions which I carried away with me after seven weeks in the Soviet Union 's European empire . it is not so much a conclusion , really , as an instinct , a presumptuous attempt to smell the shape of unwritten history . In the long run  --  perhaps the very long run  --  the Soviet attempt to impose a 98 Chinese copy of the Soviet way of life on half of Europe will fail . It will fail because , for historical and geographic reasons , it can not in the end succeed , Eastern Europe , to be sure , is not Britain . But it is stupid to suppose that only Anglo-Saxons love freedom  --  or love , if you will , the right to make a mess of things in their own way . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own languages and their ovvn long histories and proud traditions , and they comprise a vast land area and a population more than double Britain 's . You only begin really to understand how huge a hunk of Europe the Soviets have bitten off- when you drive the whole , long , long - Mite , hour after hour at the wheel , through snow-capped mountains and over seemingly endless plains . And that is the best way also to understand the extent of the attempted Russification of Eastern Europe and the depth of the instinctive resistance to it . " Russification " is the right word , too  --  it is more than Communization . For it is not simply Communism , but the Russian version of Communism , which Russia has imposed by force on Eastern Europe . Russian Communism grew out of Russia 's unique historical situation , and it has hardly more than a nodding acquaintance with the Communism of Marx and Engels . Take , for example , the collective and state farms  --  the kolkhozi and the soykhozi . The idea of communal farming is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kolkhozi and sovkholi in their present form were invented by Stalin w the early ' 30 's and used by him in his drive to liquidate the independent peasantry-5,000,000 peasants died in the process  --  and lay the basis for a powerful industrial state . Thus the collectives and state farms came into being for uniquely Russian and grimly Stalinist reasons . But they have been reproduced in Eastern Europe in the most incredibly faithful detail , right down to the shade of red which decorates the faded photographs of the Stakhanovite farm workers who have " surpassed the norm " by raising extra pigs or growing more corn . As for the corn , it is now grown all over Eastern Europe because of Nikita Khrushchev 's well-known passion for corn . Khrushchev is called " Kukuruznik : ' or " Corny Khrushchev , " in the Soviet Union . The factories in Eastern Europe are precise copies of Russian factories , right down to the hortatory signs on the walls : the schools and universities are faithful reproductions of Soviet schools and universities , and the papers , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , I was puzzled by the fact that I met a good many seemingly able newspapermen in Eastern Europe  --  for having such talent , why should they prostitute themselves ? The only " deviations " ? as any divergences from the Soviet model are called  --  occur in Poland , thanks Co Poland 's controlled revolution of 1956 . For example . a school of nonobjective art has been allowed to flourish in Poland , whereas in the other satellites only the hideous " socialist realism " as practiced in the U.S.S.R. is permitted . The Polish intellectuals are intensely proud of this show of independence . But is it not extraordinary , when you come to think of it , that the Russians should seriously attempt to dominate the life of half of Europe to the point of dictating how pigment should be placed on canvas ? The attempted Russification has generated a passive but strong resistance , as the invasion of a virus generates antibodies in the human frame . There is , for example , a certain logic in some form of co-operative or collective agricultural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not support the capital investment required for efficient hirming . But wherever the peasants have been given a chance to leave the collectives , as in Poland and Yugoslavia , they have deserted en masse , and they bitterly resist any co-operative effort at all , like the " farm circles " in Poland , as a mere mask for a return to collectives on the Russian ? model . I visited one of the very few collectives left in Poland , about an hour 's drive out of Warsaw , and I listened patiently while the Communist chairman of the collective spoke eloquently and at length on the glories of the collective system . Then l asked the obvious question : If the system was so good , why had almost all the peasants left the collectives ? This seemed to rock him back on his heels a bit , and he scratched his head reflectively for a full minute . " I must be candid with you , " he said . " If the system had come from Scandinavia , for example , l think the peasants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it came from the East ? " He nodded his head in the direction of Russia , and shrugged his shoulders , and everybody laughed . This , mind you , from a Cornmunist Party member . This strong , if passive , resistance to the Soviet swallowing-up process is one side of the coin . The other side is the magnetic attraction of all things Western , and especially all things American . The attraction , it must be admitted , is by no means only for the best things in Western culture . One lady in Vienna who had a niece in Budapest wrote the niece to ask her what she wanted for Christmas . The girl 's list was headed by chewing gum , blue jeans , and rock-'n ' - roll records . Such things are dangerous to own in the other satellites , except Poland , but the perhaps temporary right to enjoy such small symbols of the decadent West was won , ironically , by the blood the Hungarians shed in 1956 . Or consider the odd phenomenon of the rock-'n ' - roll concert I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Journalists ' Club in Warsaw by the Rhythm and Blues Band , a rock-'n ' - roll band which caused teen-age riots in Krakow and elsewhere . After the latest riot the Ministry of Culture had issued an edict in effect suppressing the Rhythm and Blues Band . Supporters of the band had arranged the concert and invited the Minister of Culture , the idea being to persuade that august figure that rock ' n ' roll was not subversive , but a genuine art form . On the entrance to the concert hall somebody had hung a black funeral wreath , inscribed : DONATED BY THE MINISTRY OF CULTURE IN MEMORY OF ME RHYTHM AND BLUES BAND  --  a bit of nose thumbing absolutely inconceivable in any of the other satellites . The concert astonished me . I had never heard rock ' n ' roll before , and I have no car anyhow , so I am no judge of the competence of the performance . What amazed me was that every song was in English , heavily accented , of course . It was strange to hear a fleshy-faced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me daahlin , hole me tate , squiz me daahlin with all yor mate " in a People 's Democracy . There was also an imitation of Tommy Steele , the British rock-'n ' - roller  --  a willowy , blond young man in a blue shirt and dark glasses  --  and the hall was alive with Brigitte Bardots . The concert ended amid vast enthusiasm , and it was followed by one of the strangest debates I have ever heard . For upward of two hours , with great seriousness and most articulately , the assembled company debated he artistic merits and political implications of rock ' n ' roll . The first speaker was an editor of the Communist youth paper , a serious young man who wore glasses and the air of a college intellectual . His paper , he said , had sponsored a jazz festival to " provide useful propaganda for our movement , " and the Rhythm and Blues Band had won first prize , thus launching the band on its sensational career . At this point naturally I expected the young Communist to confess his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Ministry of Culture . Not at all . Instead , he roundly denounced the " unnecessary brutality " of the " six carloads of militia " which had broken up the teen-age riots , and he defended rock ' IL ' roll as authentic folk art . The speakers who followed  --  most of whom were also Communists  --  were similarly indignant about the suppression of the Rhythm and Blues Band . The Minister of Culture never showed up , and after the debate had ended , when I asked whether there was a chance that the hand might be reprieved , there was a general laugh , and I was told " of course not . " And yet the curious episode seemed to me to have a certain significance all the same . For one thing , from the point of view of Moscow-trained and Moscow-oriented Communists , rock ' n ' roll is subversive , and the Minister of Culture was quile right to suppress it . All over Eastern Europe there is a sort of jazz underground , and the craze for hot jazz is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The attraction is not confined , of course , to chewing gum , or blue jeans , or rock ' n ' roll . Among educated people there is a desperate thirst for intellectual contact with the free West . Magazines and books left behind by Western travelers are jewels of great price in the satellites . This passion for forbidden literary fruit has infected the Russians also . An Austrian group of young Russian-speaking socialists , most of them ex-Communists trained in Russia , made contact with the Russian delegation to the International Youth Festival in Vienna last summer , and offered them a choice of forbidden books in Russian . The Russian youths frantically snapped up Pasternak 's Doctor Zhivago , and they were also eager for George Orwell 's 1984 and Milovan Djilas ' The New Class . They complained that the edition of Doctor Zhivago was too big to be smuggled conveniently back into the U.S.S.R. , and a more compact edition was with difficulty found for them . But though they all agreed that the system had been perverted by Stalin , and few of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a system and an idea , and they were genuinely proud of such Soviet achievements as the sputniks . The people of the satellite states have no sputnik to be proud of , and the more intelligent are quite aware that Communism is an instrument of the domination of their countries by the Russians . Outside of Poland , moreover , they have less real personal and intellectual freedom than there is even in the Soviet Union . Because Poland is the great exception , the attitude in the other satellites toward Poland is a curious compound of jealousy and attraction  --  rather like that of the other members of a large family toward the brilliant son who is allowed special privileges by the parents . An easy way to pluck the nerves of intelligent Communists in the other East European countries is to describe such examples of Polish intellectual freedom as the debate on rock ' n ' roll , with its free-swinging criticism by Communists of the Communist regime . You can almost hear the thought in their minds : " If the Poles , why not us ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present limited but genuine degree of personal freedom without an explosion , the Polish infection is likely to spread increasingly in the other satellite states . Nonsatcllite Yugoslavia also acts as a magnet on the // satellite stales . In this case the magnet is not personal freedom  --  for there is not so much free speech in Yugoslavia as in Poland  --  but Yugoslav national independence plus the Yugoslav experiments with Marxist doctrine . The most important experiment is the system which gives " Workers ' Councils " elected by the workers a share of real authority in the factories . Similar councils were established almost as the first order of business in the Hungarian revolution in 1956 , and it took the Hungarian quisling government of Janos Kadar more than a year finally to break their power . The examples of Poland and Yugoslavia . since both are still Communist states , have a particular attraction for the Communist members of the New Class . For even among Communists in Eastern Europe , there is an instinctive resistance to the total domination of Russia . The official Soviet theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Khrushchev , is that rising living standards will make loyal , passionately pro-Russian , Soviet-style Communists out of all but the most hopelessly " reactionary " Eastern Europeans . The increase in living standards is , mind you , real enough . All over Eastern Europe you can see the process which the French call the " bourgeoisernem de Conunanipple . " You can see it at a fashion show in Bucharest , with its pathetic attempt at Western elegance , or at a concert in Budapest , where some of the ladies wear fur stoles and lipstick , and hair-dressing establishments are advertised on the asbestos curtain . You can even see it on the tennis courts  --  there are a lot of tennis courts in Eastern Europe . i Tennis has now been recognized by the Kremlin as a peoples ' democratic peace-loving sport , but golf is still capitalist-imperialist . Everywhere you can see the new ruling class reaching out for some of the amenities enjoyed by the old ruling class . And even below the level of the New Class , life is certainly easier now for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by our standards . But are full bellies for the masses and " people 's cars " for the New Class going to assure the success of the Soviet attempt to Russify half Europe ? My instinct  --  and I admit it is only an instinct  --  is that full bellies and people 's cars are not going to be enough . It is an old imperialist illusion that a subject people can be bribed with food and trinkets . I think that the Soviet rulers are faced with an essentially simple choice . They can continue their effort to Russify half Europe , demanding that everything from the system of government to the ladies ' fashions be a carbon copy of the Soviet model . They can no doubt continue for a long time to rely on the internal systems of police terror in the satellites , plus the final sanction of the Red Army , to enforce their demand for slavish conformity . But in that case Eastern Europe will continue to be what I am convinced it is now  --  a drag on Soviet power and a brake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the poet complained , " I always hear Time 's winged chariot hurrying near . " At his back Nikita Khrushchev always hears the winged chariot of another and bloodier East-European uprising hurrying near . For although uprisings on the Hungarian pattern may not be likely now , Khrushchev can never know for sure when the match might light the haystack again . Above all , hecan never know what might happen if he took one risk too many  --  in Berlin , for example . Let a few shots be fired between American and Russian troops in Germany , and a great tremor of hope and excitement would pass through all East ern Europe , with consequences no man can forecast . It is in this sense that Khrushchev 's Eastern European empire acts as a brake on Soviet policy , forcing Khrushchev to think twice before taking any risk of war . In terms of military power , moreover , except in a war against a newly aggressive Germany . which the Poles particularly would fight with enthusiasm , the satellite armies are wholly unreliable for Soviet purposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is essentially fragile , although it can doubtless be held together by force for a long time to come . The only way to give it a measure of solidity is to give the Eastern Europeans , especially the new ruling class , a little self-respect , as well as full bellies and fur stoles . And the only way to do that is to abandon the effort to make Eastern Europe a carbon copy of the Soviet Union . l think the logic of their situation will force the Soviet leaders io do just that , sooner or later , Indeed , they have already played with the idea  --  when , for example , Khrushchev announced the now-disregarded doctrine of " different roads to Socialism . " Let me make myself clear . I do not think the satellite countries , in our lifetimes , are going to become anti-Russian or anti-Communist  --  unless there is another war , when all bets are off . Let us face one fact clearly . Neither the United States nqr its allies have either the will or the power to attempt to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We proved that abundantly when , after all our brave " liberation , " we tut-tutted from the side lines while the Russians drowned the Hungarian revolt in blood . If they believe it to be in their vital interest to do so , the Soviet rulers will again use the Red Army to prevent Eastern Europe from becoming either anti-Russian or anti-Communist , as they did in Hungary . For the foreseeable future , Eastern Europe will remain within the sphere of influence of the Soviet Union . But that need not mean that all the Eastern European countries must remain forever slavish copies of the Soviet Union . Our policy must be to do what we can  --  which is not a great deal  --  to prevail upon the Soviets to abandon the effort to Sovietize totally half of Europe . This is not d ' very big and glittering policy . But our big and glittering policies of the past have been consistently founded on illusions , and they have therefore.failed . One such illusion was that our war aim in Europe should be simple military victory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we indignantly rejected Winston Churchill 's proposal for a thrust at the " soft underbelly " ? and thus , as Churchill foresaw , handed over Eastern Europe to Stalin . Another illusion was the notion , embodied in the fatuous " liberation policy , " that we needed only to bellow loudly enough and the whole structure of Soviet power would collapse , like the walls of Jericho . We must have done with illusions where the lives and liberties of other people are concerned . We must learn to accept the best we can get . In Eastern Europe independent capitalist democracy is better than what we can get  --  and , in fact , it is highly unlikely that the people of Eastern Europe , given a free vote , would return to the kind of capitalism they knew before the war . The best we can get in Eastern Europe is the sort of limited personal and intellectual freedom you find in Poland ; the sort of limited economic freedom you find in Yugoslavia ; and a degree of national independence somewhere between Yugo. sla via 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It lends itself to no stirring battle cry for " liberation " or " unconditional surrender . " But it does have the merit of being theoretically , at least , attainable . And at least we can do something  --  though not a great deal  --  to attain it . The first thing we can do is to assure the absolute maximum of contact between Eastern Europe and the West . Such contact makes it impossible for the Soviet Union 's Communist proconsuls in Eastern Europe to maintain the kind of total insulation from the West which is absolutely essential  --  and for a , generation or more  --  if Eastern Europe is ever to be successfully Sovietized . The second thing we can do is to begin to consider really seriously the price we would be willing to pay for the withdrawal of Soviet forces from Europe . This is a very big subject , of course  --  too big for this space . Withdrawal of the . Red Army from Europe would not mean " liberation " of Eastern Europe , since the ultimate sanction of re-entry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But in all sorts of ways , subtle and not so subtle , it would transform the political atmosphere in Eastern Europe and assure the ultimate failure of the effort LID Sovietize the satellites . It is possible , Si4in fact , probable , that the Soviets will under no circumstances withdraw their forces except on terms unacceptable to the West . But at any rate we , and not the Russians , ought to be the champions of taking foreign troops out of the heart of Europe . And we ought also to be seriously willing to pay a serious price to get the Red Army out of Europe  --  the more so because it is now clear that neither we nor our allies are willing to make the effort necessary to transform the NATO forces into a real counterweight to the Red Army . A Europe in which the Red Army was withdrawn to Russia , and the effort to Russify half the continent abandoned , would not be an ideal Europe . For one thing , the Eastern half of the continent would still be in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe life would at least be more tolerable for the people of Eastern Europe , for whose present plight we bear a heavy share of responsibility . And in that sort of Europe a kind of cool truce might develop between the Soviet bloc and the West , a mutual policy of live and let live . In the nuclear age a cool truce is a lot better than a hot war . That sort of Europe would require , to be sure , a most important change in Russian policy . But that is not impossible . The instinctive compulsion of " the center , " as the Russian Government has been called traditionally in Russia , to regulate every detail of its subjects ' lives has roots deep in Russian history . So has the attempt to Russify Eastern Europe  --  before the first World War , Polish children were compelled by law to learn Russian in school . But after every period of flood in the tide of Russian expansionism , there has come a period of ebb . And there are two influences at work to produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One is the Soviet leaders ' fear of Chi-nese ( Canriimedfront Page 100 ) expansionism , which is a real fear , and which has made a live-and-let-live accommodation with the West far more desirable in Soviet eyes than it has been before . The other is the simple fact  --  and I am quite sure it is a fact  --  that transforming all Eastern Europe into a carbon copy of the Soviet Union is in the long run a wholly impractical project . As these conclusions perhaps suggest , I emerged from seven weeks of travel and inquiry in the European Communist states more hopeful ( perhaps uncharacteristically ) than when the trip started . There are some things in the Communist states that are impressive , like the rate of rebuilding and of industrial expansion . There are some things that are admirable , like their bread , which is marvelously good , since it is always baked fresh the same day ; or their jam , which I found to my surprise was delicious , all over Eastern Europe ; or their children , who seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to television Westerns and do not spend their days emulating murderers in wide-brimmed hats . And although it represents the death of the free intellect , there is this much to be said for their educational system : that education is taken seriously in the Communist states , and that the system guarantees a higher education to any boy or girl of good intelligence  --  provided , of course , that his or her parents are not too conspicuously of " bourgeois origin . " Altogether , the race to which Nikita Khrushchev has so repetitiously challenged us will not be an easy race , and it is more than a race simply to produce more steel or better rockets . But there is no valid reason why we should not win the race hands down . For Communism is not  --  I repeat , nor  --  the wave of the future . That is the basic conviction I took away with me from Eastern Europe . Go to West Berlin , to the shabby block of apartment houses where the refugees from East Germany are received , and there you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future . In dreary little rooms you wilt see them waiting , as refugees must always wait , the tired men in baggy pants , the sallow-faced women in kerchiefs , who have left everything be . hind , who have come again naked into the world in order to reach freedom . Es . cry day in every year they come over in their hundreds , as they always have wherever  --  as in Hungary or North Korea  --  a leak has developed in the Communist system . From East Germany more than 3,500,000 people have come over , leaving Communist Germany a bottle of human skimmed milk . No wonder Khrushchev calls Berlin a cancer which must be cut out , a bane in his throat . For Berlin underlines a simple fact  --  that Col munism , however successful it may be in producing rockets or infantry divisions , is in human terms a tragic failure . Communism will remain a failure even with an increasing standard of living . For the failure of Communism is not to be measured in average calorie consumption or the production of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overuse and misuse the word " freedom " has become a shabby , tired old word in the West . But spend a few weeks in the countries of un-freedom and it will become real to you again  --  as real and meaningful as any other word in the language . And it is a word which explains why , unless we in the ? Vcst are unimaginably foolish and flabby , the race to which Khrushchev has challenged us is a race he can not win .
