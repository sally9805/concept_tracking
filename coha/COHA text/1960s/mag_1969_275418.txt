Like General Sherman , most U.S. investors are convinced that war is something less than heaven . Last week , ignoring the normally bearish portents of monetary upheavals abroad and higher interest rates at home , Wall Street 's customers seized on rumors of brightened peace prospects in Viet Nam to continue the stock market 's best rally in more than a year . The Dow Jones industrial average rose four points to close at a year 's high of 961.61 . All told , the 38-point rise since late April was the Dow 's best performance since 13 months ago-when peace talk was also in the air . <P> Wall Street , and much of the American business community , favors what Economist Paul A. Samuelson calls a " dovish-bullish syndrome " - which conjures up visions of a hybrid creature with wings , hooves and horns . Recent history shows that peace pays . World War II and Korea were followed not by the depressions that had been predicted , but only by mild recessions that were soon erased by new bursts of prosperity . A stand-down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to open new opportunities for dealing with some of the social ills that hurt the nation and its economy . <P> Timetable for Transition . The economic consequences of peace would depend on the speed of its return . Only recently has the Administration begun a study , headed by Presidential Economic Adviser Herbert Stein , of how the transition should be made . No one expects a difficult conversion , partly because the war has driven a relatively small wedge into the economy . The defense budget accounts for only 9% of the nation 's output of goods and services , compared with nearly 13% in Korea and 41% in World War II . Direct spending on the war amounts to 3% of the gross national product , and some 1,500,000 people hold war-related jobs . <P> One schedule prepared last year by Charles Schultze , then Lyndon Johnson 's budget director , assumes that there will be a transition of two years or so from a war economy to something close to pre-Viet Nam conditions . Were a cease-fire to begin this July and troop withdrawal in January , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decline by $7 billion in 1970 and by $13 billion in 1971 . Since about one-third of the demobilized G.I.s would be going back to school , the labor force would have to absorb only some 600,000 new members-not enough to pose serious employment problems . <P> Peace Stocks . Besides bringing G.I.s home , the war 's end would free other draft-age Americans to pursue normal civilian careers and resume buying autos and houses . Those possibilities are reviving talk in Detroit of 10 million-car sales years . On Wall Street , shares of companies involved in construction have become favored " peace stocks .
