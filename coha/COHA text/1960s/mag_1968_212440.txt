Prompted by the pressure of soaring land costs and the national appetite for prime locations , builders lately have been stretching the skyline of U.S. cities to new altitudes . From San Francisco to Boston , apartment and commercial projects are growing to an unprecedented size and complexity for their areas . In congested downtown Chicago , a 100-story hive of offices , stores , apartments , restaurants and parking space is climbing toward completion next year . For a few years , the $95 million John Hancock Center will be the world 's second-tallest ( 1,107 ft. ) building , after Manhattan 's Empire State Building ( 102 stories and 1,250 ft . ) . Last week beneath the street level of Lower Manhattan , workmen were pouring 3-ft. - thick concrete foundations for the future champ , the Port of New York Authority 's twin , 110-story World Trade Center towers ( 1,350 ft. high ) . <P> All three skyscrapers , the only 100-story structures abuilding anywhere , are the handiwork of a remarkable general contractor : Manhattan 's Tishman Realty &; Construction Co . Long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and offices , Tishman has spread not only into building for others but into research and consulting , fields where few construction firms venture . Explains President Robert V. Tishman : " I got tired of seeing everybody else grabbing up our ideas-for nothing . " <P> From Home to Office . Working with such blue-chip clients as Alcoa , Dow Chemical , U.S. Steel and U.S. Gypsum , Tishman researchers have devised such cost savers as movable wall panels for faster changes in floor plans , noise-stifling floor-assembly systems , prefabrication techniques for kitchen-bathroom cores used in slum rehabilitation . Having built $630 million worth of structures across the U.S.-everything from a Philadelphia industrial park to Los Angeles ' Sheraton Wilshire Motor Inn-the company also has accumulated a salable store of insight into construction intricacies . For a consulting fee equal to 1% of the total cost , says Tishman , " we take an institution 's project and handle it like our own . " Among other things , that means spotting pitfalls that can range from wasteful structural methods to improperly designed floor areas . <P> Bob Tishman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owning tenements in Lower Manhattan . Since Bob , 51 , took command of the firm in 1962 , he has sold all but two of the 21 rental-housing projects that the company built following World War II , including all its holdings in rent-controlled New York City . The emphasis now is on a different kind of operation . Today the company operates 23 large office buildings , mostly in New York , Los Angeles , Chicago and Cleveland ; it owns more office space ( 5,775,000 sq . ft. ) than the total available in Denver , Atlanta or Kansas City . The buildings win few prizes for design ; architects still wisecrack that Tishman 's aluminum-skinned skyscraper at 666 Fifth Avenue in mid-Manhattan is " the tin can that the Seagram Building came in . " The company has $857 million worth of buildings going up , under contract or planned .
