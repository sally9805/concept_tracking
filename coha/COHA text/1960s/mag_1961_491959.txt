abnormal . Tokyo has become the largest city in the world , with a population well over 9 , o00 , - 000 . Economic production keeps climbing upward at the unbelievable rate of about 9 per cent a year . Foreign trade , especially with America , is growing even faster . Japan 's growth and change can he seen all too quickly by any tourist in his first few hours in Tokyo . The harrowing ride by " kamikaze " taxi from Haneda airport to his hotel will convince him that Japan moves at literally breakneck speed . He will sec buildings shooting up on every side , The neon lights of the Ginza will make him feel that Broadway and Piccadilly are dim relics , by comparison . But what really impressed me was the changes I found in the lives of the little people who live far away from the Ginza . I spent many hours this summer talking with Watanabe , an old fisherman friend of mine . He lives in a tiny seaside village , where the people are half fishermen and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because a near-fatal illness last winter had made him give up diving thirty feet or more for lobsters and abalone . After all , he is now seventy-five years old . He has also stopped being a part-time farmer and has sold his tiny patch of rice-land . His son has made such a success as a carpenter-contractor that the family doesn'tneed the extra income . This has given Watanahe 's wife a new deal as well , because as I remember it , she did most of the farm work . Watanabe and I reminisced about the war years , when I used to visit him as often as I could to get some of his farm products , which my parents and I needed desperately in order to stay alive at that time . We also talked about the changes which had come into his village in. ; recent years . " We all must learn to live with the times , " he remarked philosophically one 6. y . I could see what he meant . We were looking down on the beautiful , land-locked harbor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 94 ) 94 ' low , Tapan Surprised Me ( Continued from Page 31 ) been so quiet and peaceful only a few years ago . Now it was dotted with the yachts and powerboats of vacationers from Tokyo . A group of college-boy types were roaring over the tranquil surface in speedboats , most of them with water skiers in frothy tow . Change had crept into Watanabe 's own household too . His village had been incorporated into a nearby town , which had installed running water in each home . Up until then clothes and dishes had been washed out by the well , but now a tile-lined sink had been added in the kitchen . The old wooden bathtub near the well had been replaced by a shiny new bathtub in a tiled bathroom in the house . Watanabe , like all Japanese who can afford it , insists on his daily bath . As a woman , the change in the Watanabe home that impressed me most was the new electric washing machine . There it was all gleaming and beautiful , propped up on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finds in most farmhouse kitchens . It looked so incongruous there that I thought it might be mostly for show  --  a sort of status symbol . " Oh , no , " said old Mrs. Watanabe . " Every day when the grandchildren take off their clothes to have a bath , my daughter-in-law throws everything into the machine . " Then , in true mother-in-law fashion , she added in a disapproving whisper , " She even reads the newspaper while the clothes are being washed . When 1 was a bride here , I had to go down to the community well and carry up all the water myself . It 's more expensive this way , but it 's the way things are now . " It was near dinnertime , but from the room which formerly had served as the dining room came the blast of a children 's TV program . Looking in . I saw the four grandchildren , surrounded by a group of friends , squatting on the straw-mat floor in solemn concentration . The Watanabes , I learned , had been the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This , of course , had attracted all the neighborhood children , until the appearance of other sets in the village had somewhat reduced the crowd . Soon it became obvious that a single room would not do both for television viewing and for eating . The only solution had been to add a special little dining room , where the old folks could cat in peace , while the children had their fill of Japanese spacemen , American cowboys and the samurai swordplay artists who are the native Japanese counterpart of our Western gunmen . Transportation around the Watanabe house had also changed radically . Watanabe 's son , a local politico of some weight , already had graduated from a bicycle to a three-wheeled motorcycle-truck even before I left Japan four years ago . Now I found him whizzing around on a sporty motorcycle . And old Watanabe had taken an even bigger stride , status-wise . Whenever he wanted to go to the nearby town , about a mile and a half away  --  where , according to rumor , he was considered something of a gay old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : three cents for the phone call ; twenty-seven cents for the taxi ( and no tip ) . Watanabe may look to Americans , or even to city Japanese , like a survivor from the eighteenth century . But he is very much a man of the twentieth . He has been reading newspapers and listening to the radio ever since I have known him . He is thoroughly familiar with democratic procedures , having been in village and " county " politics most of his life . But sometimes he ca n't stomach the changes he sees coming to Japan . One day he exploded over a radio program he had just been listening to . " It was the silliest thing I have ever heard , " he fumed , " and if they 'd ask me , I 'd tell them to stop broadcasting such nonsense . " Apparently a group of senior-high-school boys and girls had been polled on such questions as " Do you date ? " " Have you fallen in love ? " and " Do you intend to choose your own husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your family to choose a mate ? " " They 've got no business asking boys and girls stupid questions like that , " Watanabe said . " Their job is to study while in school . " Watanabe 's generation does n't like the social changes of this type now spreading among younger Japanese . In some ways rural Japan seems to have changed more than the cities . Not so long ago the Japanese farmers lagged far behind their city brothers in their ideas , in their way of life and in their . economic conditions . Farming was backbreaking labor , and there were few mechanical gadgets , beyond bicycles and simple hand-powered threshing machines , to ease the sheer physical burden . Running water or powered equipment was rare . The diet was frugal , little but rice , a few vegetables and occasionally fish . Even in times of prosperity the farmer lived close to the edge of financial ruin . Now one sees signs of prosperity everywhere in rural Japan . Perhaps the most startling are the pint-size tractors , little bigger than lawn mowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plow , they have replaced oxen or horses in the fields . Hitched to a cart , they serve as both car and truck , transporting either the farmer 's family or his produce . A were couple of years ago the Japanese were ! ' saying that a farmer could n't get a wife if he did n't own a washing machine . Now it is , " No tractor , no wife ! " It is hard to January , , raus realize that the woman you sec today confidently driving her little tractor down the road is the same person who live years ago plodded along bowed down with a mountainous burden on her back . Fewer hands arc needed on the farms . Last year 640,000 persons left the farms , over half of them people under twenty . Many members of farm families also commute to factory jobs in nearby towns . Prime Minister Hayato Ikeda recently made the startling prediction that in ten years the agricultural working force might be reduced to a third of its present size . Prosperity has , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scale . Everyone talks about " the consumer revolution . " One of the main reasons for this has been the growing popularity of buying on credit . But whatever the causes , there can be no doubt that a lot of new goods and fancy gadgets have conic into the hands of the people . The case of our friend Motoko will illustrate what is happening in urban Japan . Long before the war Motoko , then in her teens , came to work as a maid for my husband 's parents , and four years ago she was our housekeeper . When we left Japan , we gave her a bond certificate for 100,000 yen , which sounds a lot grander than its equivalent American value , $278 . This she calls her " precious seed , " for from it has grown a prosperity that once would have been beyond the dreams of people in her position . Four years ago both Motoko and her electrical-technician husband were working , but they were only just managing to get by financially . They had two sons , one in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they hoped to send their boys to college . At the time , however , this seemed merely a pipe dream . After we left , Motoko decided to use the money we had given her to buy land on which to build a small house that would be a little more adequate for her family than the two rooms  --  nine-by-nine feet and nine-by-twelve feet  --  in which they were living . The piece of land she bought was far out in the suburbs of Tokyo , but at a place from which her husband could commute conveniently to the factory where he worked . But , while Motoko was waiting to secure a government loan to build her house , her husband 's factory moved far away from her plot of land . So , two years after buying it , she sold her little property  --  receiving , to her amazement , a 400-per-cent profit on her two-year investment . With her profits Motoko now bought another piece of land near the new factory site . But , before she could get around to building on it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a larger company  --  in still another part of the city . Enough profits remained from the sale of the first piece of property for Motoko to buy a second small piece of land near the new company . So she lent her husband the original " precious seed " we had given her as security to equip his one-room " factory , " where he and a couple of assistants turned out certain electrical parts for the main company . Business prospered . Motoko 's husband , in short order , paid back the " precious seed " to her and bought a little more land for their new housing site . They still have n't built their house , but Motoko and her husband , who four years ago possessed nothing more than their own clothing , a few household goods and the $278 bond we had given them , now own two small pieces of property and a little " factory , " while their " precious seed " is still intact . Their older boy expects to enter college this year . A. country where this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bustle . Tokyo is a boom town . Homes seem to sprout second stories or wings overnight . New subways are being dug . A monorail overhead railway is planned between Haneda airport and downtown Ginza . Steel-and-concrete office buildings are shooting up all over . Would-be tenants of office buildings clamor for the privilege to plop down $25,000 or more for the " key " to the office space they hope to occupy . After that it is up to them to put in their own partitions and the like  --  and , of course , pay the rent . Meanwhile the builder , having collected " key money " from all his tenants , now has the capital for still another building . Tokyo keeps spreading in all directions with an annual increase of several hundred thousand new residents . Fifteen to twenty miles out from the center of the city a rash of little suburban homes swallows up the little farming villages . The Japanese ideal is to have one 's own little house and garden , sealed off by a surrounding fence . But Tokyo is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expand upward as well as outward . Apartment houses are going up not only in the central parts of the city but also far Out in the suburbs . The danchi , or " group area , " has been the most interesting recent development . I visited a friend who lives in the largest and most famous of these . It is called Hibari-ga-oka , or Skylark Hill , fifteen airline miles from downtown Tokyo  --  that 's a long way to travel along Japan 's congested narrow streets . Skylark Hill consists of rows of concrete duplexes and four-story apartment 95 houses in a parklike setting . The buildings are all only one apartment wide , because every apartment must face south . This is for the sake of warmth in winter  --  there is no central heating  --  and to help dry the daily wash which fcstoons the front of each building . An average apartment  --  two rooms , kitchen and bath  --  occupies a **26;2059;TOOLONG rectangle and costs about eighteen dollars per month . Dozens of similar " group areas " are springing up all over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known in Japan . Skylark Hill 96 alone has 2718 units and more than 10.000 residents . Television also has brought a big change in Japanese life . Four years ago most people had logo to the local noodle shop or bar if they wanted to see TV . Today television sets are everywhere  --  Japan produces 175,000 of them a month . There are four commercial networks and two national ones , the latter carrying no advertising . The national networks enjoy popularity because of the educational material offered . The commercial programs do not break up their regular half-hour programs to insert advertising skits , but merely flash the sponsor 's name at the bottom of the screen from time to time . Baseball is the top television attraction . Tokyo TV stations carry simultaneously as many as four different night games between teams of the Central and Pacific Leagues  --  the Japanese " big leagues . " My husband assures me that Japanese baseball TV uses some tricks American TV could copy to advantage . Japanese telecasters keep tab on balls , strikes and outs in a corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the fine points of the plays and colorful background . Most TV programs are produced locally . but canned American soap operas and other shows are popular . It is startling to hear a couple of tough hombres from the Old West cussing each other in fluent Japanese . Perry Mason has a much deeper voice in Japanese than he does in English , but his attractive secretary , Della Street , who is the ideal of many a Japanese office girl , has the same soft-spoken style as in English . After four years away from Japan , one of the things 1 found most changed was the language itself . I had to learn a whole new vocabulary  --  including new slang . For instance , the young men who go zooming recklessly around on their motorcycles are called kaminari-zoku , or " the thunder tribe . " Hundreds of new words have crept in from English and other languages , undergoing startling transformations . A photography or knitting club is likely to be called a saakuru. or " circle . " If there is trouble , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patororu kaa , which is the Japanese rendition of " patrol car . " In a television play 1 heard a young man , himself distinctly beatnik , tell his old-fashioned father , " Old things themselves are no good . They 're only good if you make them nuberu-bagu . " ( Translation : nouvelle vague , and if you still want a translation , that 's French for " new wave " or " up to date . " ) Ibelieve the Japanese people are extremely friendly toward Americans , perhaps more so than ever before in history . Then why the big blowup last May and June over the security treaty with the United States and over President Eisenhower 's proposed visit ? Why the frenzied demonstrations by hundreds of thousands of people , just when American-Japanese trade relations , friendship and mutual respect seemed stronger than ever before ? Many Americans must have felt that , despite its modernization , Japan after all was still the mysterious and inscrutable East . Even my husband and I , with our knowledge of Japan , found it hard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstrating the way they did they were striking a blow for democracy . We reached Japan a few days after the troubles had subsided , but found everyone still terribly excited and eager to argue about the whole affair . We spent many interesting  --  though exhausting hours discussing it with students , professors . professional men , women leaders and housewives who had eilher participated themselves or else sympathized with the demonstrations . Our first and most discouraging conclusion from these discussions was that at no other time since World War I I had the gap between American and Japanese thinking been greater , Each side seemed to feel deep disappointment in the other . Many Americans felt that ail the demonstrations had been planned and carried out solely by the Communists , and that any non-Communist Japanese who had participated had been a stupid pawn of the Communists . Other Americans recognized that , although the Communists had organized some demonstrations and had profited from them , the bulk of the demonstrators were certainly not Communists or sympathetic to Communist aims , But even these Americans felt a sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves to be so highly emotional and , as it seemed to them , irrational . Many Japanese , on the other hand , seemed frustrated at what they felt was American unwillingness to understand their position . They were sure that they had been helping to achieve peace and democracy , and they wondered why Americans could n't see this . In fact , one of our friends insisted that the demonstrations were the start of real democracy in Japan . To understand what he meant , one has to go back to the history behind the demonstrations . When Nobusuke Kishi became prime minister in 1957 , he started negotiations on a new security treaty with the United States to take the place of the one imposed on Japan during the American occupation . Although the new treaty gave Japan many more powers and greater equality than had the old treaty , there was strong opposition to it in Japan . This did not come merely from the Communists , who are only a very small  --  if noisy  --  group . The two much bigger Socialist parties and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposed to the new treaty . Because of Japan 's bitter experience in World War II , most Japanese arc violently opposed to any thought of war . This carries over to opposition to rearmament and to any sort of military alliance , Japan , many Japanese feel , would be safer with no defense at all Ihan if allied with either Russia or the United States . This attitude may be entirely unrealistic under present world conditions , hut  --  reasonable or not  --  it is very widespread in Japan . Popular feeling about the security treaty was greatly intensified by the U-2 incident and the collapse of the summit conference in Paris . It became evident that , despite the clear majority of Kishi 's Liberal-Democratic Party in the Diet , the Socialists would fight ratification of the treaty bitterly . The Socialists ' design was to have the Diet go into recess before ratification could be voted , while Kishi was determined to extend the Diet session until the treaty was ratified . The Socialists , in order to prevent a vote extending the Diet session , barricaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sit-down encampment in the halls of the Diet building . Kishi countered by bringing in 500 policemen to drag the Socialist Diet members out of the way . During their absence from the Diet , Kishi had the extension of the Diet session voted and , even to the surprise of his own party members , had the treaty ratified without further discussion . This all happened on the night of May nineteenth . It meant that the treaty would go into effect a month later , on June nineteenth , the day President Eisenhower was scheduled to reach Japan . An already emotionally tense public was outraged . The ratification of the treaty without the presence of the opposition reminded Japanese of the actions of the militarists who had led Japan into a disastrous war . Kishi , a former member of the now-hated wartime Tojo cabinet , was the target of the indignation of the people . The timing of President Eisenhower 's visit was interpreted by many as an American effort to bring pressure to bear on domestic Japanese politics . People who had taken relatively little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their opinions forcefully . Crowds started clamoring for the resignation of Kishi , the cancellation of the President 's visit and the dissolution of the Diet , so that new elections could give a clear popular mandate on the treaty question . " Protect democracy " also hccame a popular slogan , because people fell that Kishi 's actions were a threat to continued parliamentary government . Many people who joined in the demonstrations felt that they were participating in politics for the first time in their lives , They had voted , of course . but otherwise they had been only side-line critics of the political game . Now they felt that they were out on the field themselves . They told us that this is why they considered the demonstrations a step toward the achievement of " full democracy . " The most curious thing about the disturbances of last May and June is the speed with which they subsided . And it should be pointed out that they were limited largely to Tokyo . The Watanabes throughout Japan , for the most part , thought the whole business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole kept its balance . This was demonstrated in the general elections of last November twentieth , when Prime Minister Hayato Ikeda 's Liberal-Democratic Party won 296 of the 467 seats in the House of Representatives . It was the biggest parliamentary majority given any Japanese Government since World War II , However , it must not be overlooked that the rioting over the American-Japanese security treaty produced some ugly hang-overs . The resort to violence by the Communists and their sympathizers induced the extreme rightists of Japan to turn to violence too . After World War II , these believers in Japan 's prewar imperialistic and fascist policies went underground , and nothing was heard from them . But last spring they engaged in fierce battles with the demonstrators , and some of their younger followers returned to the tactic of political assassination . Rightists stabbed both Prime Minister Kishi and a leading Socialist politician named Kawakami . Then , while he was delivering a heated political address on last October twelfth , Inejiro Asanuma , the chairman of the Socialist Party , was stabbed to death by a seventeen-year-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assassinations of this type helped Japan 's military fascists seize power before World War II . But the Japanese public 's reaction to Asanuma 's assassination was entirely different from public response to such tactics before the war . At that time there was little indignation ; indeed , there was instead a sort of approval for the " idealism " and " patriotism " of the assassins . This time there was no such sentiment  --  the assassin and everything he stood for were condemned by almost everybody . It seemed that the people had been doing some sober thinking about the responsibilities of the citizens of a true democracy , and about the necessity of adhering strictly to parliamentary procedures  --  to life by law , Since Prime Minister Hayato lkead has succeeded Kishi , he has shown evidence that he has learned a great deal from his predecessor 's mistakes . And some of his positive innovations have been popular  --  the appointment of Japan 's first woman cabinet minister , for example . On balance , it does not seem to me that the May and June @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japan 's politics or Japan 's friendly relations with the United States . But almost everything else in Japan seems to be changing at a merry pace . When I come back for my next visit to Japan . perhaps four years from now , I am sure I will find as many bewildering changes as I did this time.
