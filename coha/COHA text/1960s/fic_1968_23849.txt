WHERE DO THE DETECTIVES EAT ? a story by Margot Hent off Along time ago , when I was very young , Elizabeth Taylor and I got married  --  each for the first time and in the same summer . We traveled in Europe that July ; she with Nicky Hilton , I with my then husband , both of us visiting essentially the same places , she usually leaving an area some days before I arrived . T knew where she was because the European press kept following her , and I read the stories with an interest born of identification . What the papers did n't tell me was how she felt about being married , so I never knew what Elizabeth Taylor did ; but all that summer , I cried and cried and cried . I wept in Paris caf  --  s , in English bookshops , and in Swiss trains going over the mountains . But most of all , I wept on my twentieth birthday in a room in the Golf Hotel in St. Jean-de-Luz . I sat , that day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , the Pyrenees . The sky was blue , the trees green . There were flowering bushes in the gardens , and striped tents on the beach below . The more I looked , the lovelier it became , and the lovelier it was , the more I cried , knowing that not only was all Europe my jail , but that New York , where we lived , was not going to be any better because I was married now , and I was twenty years old , and everything had passed me by . Many years have gone . Elizabeth Taylor and I remarried ; she a number of times , I once . I still do n't know how she feels about things , but I have learned a lot since that summer . One of the things I learned is that I was n't so stupid when I cried . This morning , sick of the sound of children , I walk through my happy home . It is Saturday . Christina , my oldest daughter , is in her room . She has begun high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she entered at three . Her old class-73 mates are scattered . She has been writing to a friend . The letter lies on her bed as she dances around the room to WMCA . Swinging her dime-store hips , Christina , at fourteen , is hip . T have no compunction at reading her letter upside down . Why should I  --  we are enemies . School is rank the letter says . Nobody hear can dance . I read Candy yesterday . The part about her and the hunchback is groovy . Maybe my father will take me with him to New Mexico . I ca n't wait to get to Sante Fe ! On the envelope she has written : De liver De letter De sooner De bet ter I turn the radio dial to WINS for a weather report . " Oh God , " Christina says , " the news ! " She thinks the news is square and would prefer things to swing . I , too , would prefer things to swing , but am less hopeful than Christina , having listened to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to swing into life . " I ca n't wait to get to Santa Fe ! " Oh Miss Hippie , where do you think you 're going ? Christina 's desk is stuffed with letters . She and her friends communicate . " I love you , " the boys write her " There is something between us , I know . " Words from a popular song twenty years old . " I really like you a lot , " Christina writes to each of them in turn . No dope , she , but will keep them hanging while saving her passion for a seventeenyear-old from Lawrenceville who dances loose-kneed and jangly . On him , even short hair is okay . He sends her no letters . I see that Christina is eating a marshmallow cupcake for breakfast . And a Coca-Cola . 74 WHERE DO THE DETECTIVES EAT ? " You ca n't eat that way , " I say . " It 's disgusting . " " I want to live with my father , " she says . " I hate you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The words hiss through the Yardley Slicker shining on her lips . Her eyes are full of tears . The younger children from this second marriage live here too . But Christina is my obsession . Another day begins . It is October , once my favorite season . The sidewalk on Twelfth Street has trees which drop whips in October . My five-year-old son gathers them for his arsenal against the world . When I see them , I know that Christmas is almost here . Again . And my house will be wrapped in its Black Forest cheer . What no one knows is that I hate even the Christmas ornaments saved from my childhood , the ones I wrap so carefully in tissue paper each January and put away on the high shelf of the linen closet . We are very merry at Christmas in my house . I once read that Elizabeth Taylor loves Christmas , that she sends extravagant presents to friends . I , too , do that , shopping all December . But then , I am always buying . For a month now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Saks ' and Bloomingdale 's and Bonwit Teller 's entering the house on the shoulders of carriers like provisions for a caravan . The children need things for their journeys . But I need nothing . My closets are overflowing , and I am going nowhere . " What do you want for Christmas ? " the younger children ask me . I want to be left alone for Christmas . And for April . And for October . " I do n't know , " I say . " You think of something . " Do you know how many nights I have planned to run away ? Leaving a note on Christina 's ( yes , Christina 's  --  not my husband 's or the other children 's ) pillow which would say , I have gone . Do nut try to find me . Leave that to me . I have taken myself away . Today I am on my way to Bendel 's to buy a fall of hair . Thick and fake , with it on my head , perhaps I will stay on top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a momentary view of the sky , Blue . So what ? I am no longer beguiled by the October sky over New York . But then , neither do I shiver in despair when the late-winter sun comes in my window . There are , I expect , compensations for most things . Has Elizabeth Taylor found out what they are ? Upstairs , on the Beauty Floor at Bendel 's , which is latticed and wickered like a country sun-room , I am waiting for my fall . They bring it to me , attach it to my head , and I sail out through the ground floor Street of Shops , my neck like a swan 's bending under the weight of this great mass of hair which flows downward in a manner far too jeune file for a woman of my age and character . I walk to Fifth Avenue and there , in front of Tiffany 's , is Beejay Ward , Christina 's closest friend for all the years before this . She has been away at school in Vermont . At five , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Beejay still wears bangs to cover the mark . At eight , they shared a room at camp and cried in each other 's arms all night all summer . Last year they were hardly separated for a waking hour , and I wondered how they would ever exist apart . I had no idea Beejay was in town this weekend . " Beejay , " I say . " Have you spoken to Christina ? Are n't you coming to see us ? " Christina is busy . Beejay is busy . The moon is rising over Tiffany 's . It hangs pale and unadmired in the afternoon sky . Jesus  --  who needs a moon in the afternoon ? And what right have Christina and Beejay to be busy  --  they who had no business except with each other ? They have no right to do this to me who is left , ghostlike , a receptacle of their memories . Later , at home , Christina says , " God , you look dumb with that hair on . Anyone can see it is n't yours . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get yours . I tell her about meeting Beejay . " Mammy , " she says gently , " you ca n't stay best friends forever . " . Another afternoon , November . Sunday . Almost five o'clock . We are at the Central Park zoo  --  my husband and I and the two small boys . All day the sky has been gray and now , growing dark , it has an underlayer of mauve , of ashes of roses . " Paris light , " my husband says . The Delacorte clock had chimed earlier . The elephant danced , and the goat . Now , people are leaving the zoo as we move further in . The trees are bare except where escaped balloons hang from branches like strange shrunken fruit , at once both bright and withered . The park lamps go on , each globe a moon . The Dutch calliope plays , and the camel 's back is outlined against the darkness . Margot Hentoff 's writing has appeared in " Harper 's Bazaar " and the " Village Voice " and elsewhere . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , forever . This is her first story in " Harper's. " 78 WHERE DO THE DETECTIVES EAT ? " Popcorn ! Balloons ! " the boys cry . I walk ahead , A hundred moons are lit for me around the seal pool . The sea lions are dark in the dark water , " We want something ! " the boys cry in the distance . The zoo is almost empty . It begins to rain . " Where are you ? " my husband calls . " It 's time to leave . " Is she lost ? " the boys ask . " Get us balloons . " And we ride in a taxi , warm and crowded , home through the rainy streets . Christmas week . Christina is having a party for those friends who are back from school . The record player sends Donovan 's dreams into my room . In the living room , they are flushed and dancing . The lights are dim . Christina is moving to the music close to a boy who has grown so tall I hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I walk by . Beejay is here . She has brought with her a boy from her new school . They sit in a corner of the dining room , his arm around her , she leaning into his shoulder . They are so obviously in love as they talk , ignoring the others . Christina is enraged . She whirls into my bedroom . " Beejay has some nerve bringing her own date , " she says . " She thinks she 's so great . Well , I think they 're both creeps  --  and I 'm never inviting her again . And you , " she says before she slams the door , " stop coming out there and looking at us ! " She goes out , then opens the door again . " Mommy , " she says , her face softening , " Bruno is in love with me . " Bruno , I think , is a name for a bear . This morning , Sally , my friend of longest standing , called to tell me she had taken a lover . Twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blond hair falling across his eyes . He comes to her house to tutor her son in math . Her husband suspects nothing . But I can see Sally at twenty , and tonight I am appalled that we age in our own skins . Winter is over . I pack away the winter clothes and think of painting the summer house . At night I say to my husband , " You know , we 'll only have to paint the house about three more times before we die . " " In that case , " he answers , " one must be careful about the colors . " White , then , with black trim . And the furs to be sent to storage . Elizabeth Taylor and I have everything . And sometimes , these spring days , driving on the highway close to the river , I am happy . Evenings , Christina floats through the apart-merit in a mist . Her voice is liquid . I can hardly see her . Her new friends make me uneasy . Their speech is like music and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gravity ? She tells me nothing . Mirror balls hang in her room and music boxes play . I understand nothing of the change  --  feel primitive and brutal as I plow through her drawers looking for clues . There are none . She has emptied the desk of herself . Not even a scrap of paper written in her own hand . For my husband , a letter from a patient in the morning mail : Dear Doctor , The Family often uses detectives to ensure family unity . But what about holidays ? Do the detectives cat with the family on holidays ? If not , where do they eat ? If you do not understand this , there will be no further explanation . I do not understand it . A letter from a madman . But tell me , on holidays , where do the detectives eat ? An afternoon in June . I rest in a soft bed , the curtains drawn . The voices of the children are blank and far away . They are being tended by someone else . All is as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the funeral chapel , in her casket blanketed with daffodils , Beejay lies . Her lovely eyes are closed , her cheek and hair so smooth . We are weeping , all of us , parents , teachers , friends . Christina and I look at one another tenderly , holding hands in mutual sorrow . A ray of sunlight comes through the stained-glass window and falls , two rows behind us and to the left , on the head of Elizabeth Taylor , whose hair is short and fluffy as it was in the summer of 1950 , and from under whose dark lashes , large and perfect tears unceasingly roll .
