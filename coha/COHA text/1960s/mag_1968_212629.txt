As it develops , the discipline has spawned such hybrids or specialties as computational linguistics , sociolinguistics , psycholinguistics , even biological linguistics . All of which has led to a far higher standing in academe than universities traditionally accorded their linguists , who until recently were normally employed as mere appendages to anthropology or foreign-language departments . <P> As an academic discipline , the study of linguistics can probably be traced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked out the first systematic description of Sanskrit .
