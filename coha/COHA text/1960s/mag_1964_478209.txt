It is a temptation these days to dismiss Harry Bridges , the aging president of the International Longshoremen 's and Warehousemen 's Union , as an old radical gone soft and conservative . The same journals which once headlined his suspected communist affiliations now emphasize his preference for some Republican leaders over Democrats , his divorce from all major labor leaders with the exception of the Teamsters ' Jimmy Hoffa , his businesslike relations with the shipping lines , and his handling of some union projects with an eye on that familiar target of his wrath : the profit motive . The argument is persuasive . Today Bridges moves among his former enemies in shipping circles with the same respect he always commanded among the longshoremen . He has negotiated a succession of back-slapping deals with the shipping lines , culminating in an unprecedented automation agreement which will permit a steady reduction of the work force on the docks . The West Coast has been the pioneer in labor-management agreements dealing directly with automation . This is , as Bruce Bliven writes , not just a coincidence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of conservative tradition than the East , more willing to experiment boldly . " Two other major contracts with profound implications for the future have recently been negotiated in the area , one involving Kaiser Steel and its steelworkers , the other Southern Pacific Railroad and its clerks . Although in their details all three agreements differ considerably , their broad outlines are similar . Each union has pledged not to fight automation . In return , management in all three contracts is paying out big money as part of a guarantee that no worker will suffer from the introduction of labor-saving machinery . In Harry Bridges ' automation settlement , the Pacific Maritime Association , on behalf of the shipping lines , has exchanged a share in the profits to be made from automation for an end to old ILWU-negotiated work rules . These rules were designed to give longshoremen the greatest possible number of paid work hours ; they created unnecessary jobs and caused the operation of equipment at less than capacity . Bridges agreed to junk these work rules , for which he and his men had fought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return for a longshoremen 's trust fund into which the employers would pay $29 million during the five and one half years of the pact . The fund is used for vested early retirement rights and a no-layoff guarantee for the fully registered work force . Bridges insists that the word automation in the settlement is a misnomer . " Mechanization is the proper term ? machines and their use by the employer to increase profits . You ca n't go getting mad at the employer , because under our system he 's in business to make profits . So you have to try to work out a solution within the system , and ours is admittedly a pretty selfish solution . " His agreement provides that not a single worker can be laid off , no matter how many machines are brought in . " We 'll have a dwindling work force , " Bridges admitted to me one day . " But what is disappearing is not jobs . " Bridges eased his skinny frame far back into a swivel chair . One leg , jerking up and down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gray-haired , dressed in a conservative suit , with a white collar and a tie , he might have passed for some minor corporation executive . " Under our agreement , if there 's no work for a man in one part of the docks , he 's switched to another job . But there is no new work force . It is being replaced by machines . Our membership will slip . " ( It has already slipped from a peak of 90,000 to 65,000 . ) The longshoremen are guaranteed a thirty-five-hour work week , without speedups or increased work loads ; retirement benefits-87,920 on actual retirement and $115 a month income after the age of sixty-five ( plus maximum social security ) ; and full medical coverage for the workers and their dependents . " In all of this , " Bridges says , " a share of the savings of the machine goes to the worker . It goes to him in the form of job security , early retirement , and guaranteed work opportunity . The workers , as such , are entitled to a share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased wages , or any benefits . Under our agreement , we 've got a mortgage on all of the ships that come into port . We 've got a fund , based on tonnage-26 cents a ton on every ship that moves across the dock , The money goes into that fund whether the company 's got any profits or not . That 's not my concern . I 'm looking out for the working man . " Last of the Crusaders ? This is the executive side of the new Harry Bridges . But it is a miscalculation to take this aspect of his curious and contradictory personality as the only one . Just three years ago Bridges was caught by television cameras in the center of the fracas in San Francisco over the House Committee on Un80 HARRY BRIDGES AS BUSINESSMAN American Activities . Notwithstanding IICUA 's inflammatory film , Operation Abolition , which pictured him as a leader of the demonstrations , he was cleared of inciting a riot against the committee . But he most definitely was there to oppose the committee , and he continues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In his column in the ILWU 's official newspaper , the Dispatcher , he stresses the theme of peace with Russia and China . His union has refused to write a clause into its constitution banning communists from office . A dock worker , Archie Brown , who holds one of thirty-five minor positions on the executive board of an ILWU local , has been convicted by a jury in the U.S. District Court in San Francisco , under a clause in the Landrum-Griffin Act making it an offense for a communist to hold office in a union . His ease is on appeal . Bridges maintains that in a democracy a union 's members must have complete freedom of choice in an election . Bridges further tries to maintain an image of the last of the crusaders among major labor leaders by making his union a leader in civil-rights activities . It was the ILWU , along with a Negro church group , which organized a rousing civil-rights march down Market Street in San Francisco , The demonstration drew 20,000 participants , the largest of any kind in the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were conspicuous for their lack of participation , Bridges had an integrated drum-and-bugle corps marching in the parade . There is a considerable disparity between Bridges ' expressions and his actions . On the one hand he denounces the leaders of some of his own locals for casting aside idealism , confining themselves to moneymaking , and establishing " job trusts . " On the other hand he admits that his automation agreement was bound to mean a limited work force . His stated preference for Richard Nixon in the 1960 election is just as ironical , although he denies that he actually gave support to the Republican candidate . " I have no illusions about the Republican party being the party of the working class , " he says . " But I have no illusions about the Democratic party being the party of the working class either . Now , the bulk of our membership believes there is a difference in the parties , and they are Democrats . But as for me , I 'm anti-capitalist . I believe in the planned economy type of thinking . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communist or anything . " He ranks the " proponents of war " in the United States as ( 1 ) the AFL-CIO , ( 2 ) the Democratic party , ( 3 ) Wall Street and the Republican party . " In that order , " he says . A Life of Harassment Those who believe that Bridges has gone soft fail to understand the effects of his long isolation from the respectable levels of society . No major labor leader in the United States , including John L. Lewis and Hoffa , has been more continually harassed . He has been labeled a communist and attacked as a sinister figure not only by business , government , and the press , but also by a large segment of the American union movement itself . Bridges was born in Melbourne , Australia , sixty-three years ago . His father , a prosperous real-estate agent , had Harry collect rent from poor families , an experience which bore heavily on the young man 's mind . Later , in search of adventure , he shipped as an ordinary seaman and soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work as a longshoreman on the San Francisco docks . He became a leader against the attempt of an employer-controlled longshoremen 's association to impose dictatorial controls on the dock workers . Eleven years later , in 1934 , he obtained a ruling from a board appointed by President Roosevelt that foremen on the docks could no longer line up gangs of laborers and , with the help of strong-arm men , work them sixteen hours a day without overtime pay . The board 's ruling established the policy of employers ' obtaining crews from union-controlled hiring halls . In the same year came the famous " Bloody Thursday " maritime strike , in which police shot some of the militant picketers , killing two and wounding hundreds . Bridges headed the strike committee , which allegedly accepted aid from the Communist Party . On the basis of that allegation Harper Knowles , head of the American Legion 's subversive-activities committee , charged that Bridges was a communist and that the strike had been directed by Moscow . Bridges was not yet an American citizen , and Knowles urged deportation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bridges which was to continue for the better part of two decades . It took five years to work up a full-scale deportation hearing and by that time Bridges was monarch of the Pacific waterfront . Dean James M. Landis of the Harvard Law School , the first of many judicial figures to denounce the campaign against Bridges , presided over the 1939 hearing . Landis called much of the testimony by key witnesses " a morass of prevarication . " After a 7,700-page transcript had been filled , Landis ruled that there was no proof of Bridges ' being a communist . After another hearing in 1941 , * Judge Charles B. Sears , a retired New York judge , decided that Bridges had been " affiliated " with the Communist Party and recommended that he be deported . The CIO rallied to Bridges ' side , and its leaders became particularly incensed when Attorney General Francis Biddle , despite a reversal of the Sears decision , ordered Bridges deported anyway . In 1945 the U. S. Supreme Court ruled , five to three , that Bridges had received " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Communist Party , " and Biddle 's deportation order was canceled , In his concurring opinion Justice Frank Murphy said " The record in this case will stand forever as a monument to man 's intolerance of man . Seldom if ever in the history of this nation has there been such a concentrated and relentless crusade to deport an individual because he dared to exercise the freedom that belongs to him as a human being and that is guaranteed to him by the Constitution . " Four months later Bridges became a naturalized citizen . His troubles , however , were not over . In 1919 a parade of witnesses , one of them Bridges ' former wife , testified in federal court that he had been a communist during the ' twenties and early ' thirties . After two government witnesses swore to seeing Bridges at the Communist Party convention in New York in 1936 , defense attorney Vincent Hallinan ( who later got a six-months suspended sentence for contempt of court for his wild courtroom antics ) proved that Bridges had been in Stockton , California , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's key witness had been paid $5,000 to testify and that the Immigration Service had persuaded the Los An- * The most amusing development during the time of the second hearing was an editorial in Business Week which stated : " Many businessmen . who might once have welcomed his deportation , have learned to work with Australian Harry and they are concerned about the instability of labor relations which might follow in the wake of his martyrdom . " geles courts to expunge the witness 's criminal record . The jury was not impressed . convicting Bridges for perjury and for conspiring with others to conceal a communist background . He was sentenced to five years , a decision which was eventually overruled by the U. S. Court of Appeals . In 1952 the U. S. Supreme Court brought the lengthy dispute to an end by ruling that the statute of limitations had expired . Although his court battles were over , Bridges still had to face continuing recriminations from organized labor and the press . In 1950 , during his final trial , Bridges and the entire 1LWU had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infiltrating the union with communists . From that time until Jimmy Hoffa took the spotlight away from him , Bridges was to remain the whipping boy of organized labor . Incorruptible and Underpaid Many of Bridges ' activities today must inevitably be a reaction to a past which has left him embittered . He takes great satisfaction in thumbing his nose at the rest of organized labor . His power on the West Coast docks is supreme . The jurisdiction of his union is absolute , and his new automation agreement amounts to an impregna-ble bulwark against any worker who can not be sent to work through the ILWU . Life under Bridges has been good for the longshoremen . They are a respected element in the community . In San Francisco they average more than $6.000 a year in wages , compared to the $4000 average of other laborers . In Los Angeles the contrast is even greater , with the average for longshoremen $6,700 and for other laborers $ . ' , G00 . These averages , according to the 1960 U. S. Census , are also higher than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carpenters , auto mechanics , painters , and truck drivers in the area . Bridges has achieved this standard of living for his workers without the slightest trace of union racketeering . One shipping magnate calls him " incorruptible . " Despite the communist charges , he can hobnob with the leaders of industry and reach business agreements with big shipping interests with greater facility than any other unionist . Yet he himself remains the lowest paid of all the well-known labor leaders in the country , drawing a salary no higher than the top pay for some ILWU members ? $235 a week . He lives unpretentiously in a pleasant section of San Francisco 's Mission District . He is the only na84 HARRY BRIDGES AS BUSINESSMAN tionally known labor leader in San Francisco I know of who " makes the scene , " as they say here , with the ordinary people . He can be seen taking his child to a playground where everybody else goes . He is not a country-club man . John Dos Passos wrote in Midcentury that Bridges had been " keen about herding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Actually Bridges and the ILWU fought the relocation of the Japanese-Americans . In fact Bridges is now married to a nisei who , as a girl , had been sent to one of the camps . There are vast differences between Bridges and other big names in labor , and he is quite blunt in telling anyone what they are . " George Mean : . he says , " is the darling of the big corporations and big business . " When Bridges starts on this subject , his eyes grow wider and the sharp Australian accent he never lost seems to take over from any acquired Americanisms . " Meany was never on a picket line or on a strike in his life . The way he thinks of the working man is the way it affects me , George Meany . He has to bring about some benefits to make it look good , but he does n't care about the working man . All he cares about is George Meany . " Bridges ' attitude toward Meany is not mysterious . Meany himself admits to being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before a meeting of employers that he had never been in a strike or walked a picket line . He enjoys living high , rides in a chauffeured Cadillac ? the symbol of the boss in union literature and songs ? and conducts himself to a great extent like a corporation president . Furthermore , he is vigorously anticommunist , and anyone who is vigorously anticommunist is certain to become the enemy of Harry Bridges , the foremost defender of Russia and China in the American labor movement . " Labor Is Going No Place " It is somewhat more difficult , however , to appreciate Bridges ' attitude toward Walter Reuther . " Reuther is a stooge for the Kennedy Administration , " he told inc . " They all are . The AFL-CIO leaders put respectability above their interest in the working man . They were more guilty than the politicians in bringing on Landrum-Griffin . They were concerned first and foremost with their own personal images , their own respectability . They have to be thought of first as the champions of free enterprise . " To understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came up through the ranks of labor as swiftly as he did in the 1930s because he was a Socialist at a time when it was advantageous to be one ? at least in the United Auto Workers and the CIO . Moreover , when Reuther was leading a faction against the dictatorial , strikebreaking president of the UAW , Homer Martin , he permitted members of the Communist Party to do much of the necessary infighting . This is not to say Reuther was undisturbed by the alliance , but only that he went along with it because he considered Homer Martin the greater danger . Reuther was vigorously opposed to the business unionism of the Gompers school . which was adopted by Martin and also by George Meany . While Meany moved to the top of the . AFL through his conservative business unionism , Reuther won his fights by projecting the image of a labor leader who , while opposed to communism , was even more militant and effective than the communist faction in the CTO . Reuther later adopted new political positions , however , which were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to become an all-out New Dealer . In 1946 when he was elected president of the UAW with an opposing board , he eliminated his opposition by convincing the union membership that Communists were still a strong force in the CIO . Two years later , in 1948 , Bridges became engaged in an irrevocable clash with the other CIO leaders over Henry Wallace 's Presidential candidacy . Bridges supported Wallace : the CIO backed Truman . " They are not trade unionists , " Reuther said , in a famous speech assailing the Wallace supporters . " They are colonial agents of a foreign government using the trade unions as an operating base . " Bridges denounced Reuther and the other CIO leaders , arguing that in making peace with the Truman Administration they were abandoning the class struggle between employers and workers . As for the anticommunist attack , Bridges said : " It is a sad day for American labor when the workers themselves fall for the bosses ' time-honored trick of red-baiting . " When Bridges assails Meany and Reuther these days , he concentrates on communism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now the labor movement is going no place , " he says . " The official AFL-CIO leadership is more concerned about the residents of West Berlin than about getting jobs for all in the AFL-CIO . The leaders of the AFL-CIO are the leading warmongers in this country . They do n't want to do anything about unemployment . They just want to get us into a war over SG Berlin or Cuba . Within the AFL-CIO there are no solutions for unemployment . The AFL are the greatest supporters of free enterprise , of capitalism , in this country . In all other countries , the trade-union movement leads to some kind of socialized type of planned production . " The most ironical aspect of Bridges ' conduct today is that his paradigm for the rest of organized labor could easily be directed toward his own leadership . If AFL-CIO unions are run on the principle of business first , so is the ILWU . Today Bridges is more closely identified with Hoffa than anyone else . But this is for practical reasons . Both are opposed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jurisdictional disputes , lest they weaken their positions still further . Even though Bridges and Hoffa are friends , they stand far apart in their union methods and ideals . In these Bridges and Reuther ? the enemies ? are much more similar . Hoffa has tied himself in with hoodlums , used union funds to arrange big business deals , retained batteries of lawyers to keep himself out of jail , taken the highest salary of any labor official for himself , and raided one field after another to increase the size of his empire . Bridges and Reuther are strict moralists , absolutely above hoodlumism . Both keep their unions ' funds out of speculation , take salaries so small that they are actually niggardly for men in positions of such responsibility , and use much of their union machinery to deal with social problems . Hoffa is known to the public ? although not to all of his own men by any means ? as the big-money man ; Reuther and Bridges are known to all as the little man 's heroes . When Bridges is pressed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has much to say on peace , civil rights , and money . On other subjects , such as the solutions to unemployment which he says the others do n't have , he falls back on a condemnation of the system : " I do n't think under our present system we can do anything to stop unemployment and layoffs . Our present social system is based on the idea that when you ca n't use a worker for profitable production , you get rid of that worker without any concern over what happens to him afterward ? his food , medical care , education , or anything else . " But his own solution to unemployment and layoffs has been to get a share in the savings resulting from automation for his present union members ? without regard for dwindling future membership . Agreements like the Bridges automation contract are not works of a militant idealism . They are a retreat from the awesome problem of unemployment in future generations . For the most part Harry Bridges remains alone , isolated from all but the Teamsters , with whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is without the national influence of which he once dreamed . The hopes have not vanished , but they have now become an old man 's hopes , talked about at times with the animation of the past , but no longer pursued because pursuit has become impossible . He now spends most of his time taking care of the needs of 65,000 longshoremen . There is little else he can do .
