The grey colt was a son of the great Native Dancer , but he had chronically " mushy " ( swollen ) ankles , and it seemed he might never get to the races . So Owner Peter Fuller decided to get rid of him . He changed the horse 's name from A.T . ' s Image ( after Fuller 's father , former Massachusetts Governor A. T. Fuller ) to Dancer 's Image , and put him up for auction . The bidding reached $25,000 , stopped-and , just as the gavel was about to fall , Fuller had a change of heart . After bidding $26,000 himself , he paid the auctioneer 's 10% commission and took the animal back . <P> That was a year ago . Twice since then , Fuller has come close to selling Dancer 's Image-for $500,000 and $1,000,000 . Each time he held off . The colt 's ankles were still so bad that he had to stand for hours in buckets of ice to reduce the swelling , but he was winning races anyway-the Governor 's Gold Cup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fuller finally decided to take a big gamble , enter the horse in the Kentucky Derby , and pray that his ankles held up . Last week , with one of the most stirring stretch drives in Derby history , Owner Fuller 's gimpy grey won the 94th running of the famed race , and the question was : what price Dancer 's Image now ? <P> Name it-considering the race he ran . <P> Ridden by Bobby Ussery , Dancer 's Image broke tardily , was running dead last when the 14-horse field pounded into the backstretch . Rounding the final turn , he still trailed the pacesetting favorite ( at 8-to-5 odds ) , Calumet Farm 's Forward Pass , by eight lengths . Only then , when the horses straightened out in the stretch , did Dancer 's Image really begin to run . With Jockey Ussery merely clucking to him , he rushed up along the rail , caught Forward Pass at the imi . pole and drew away to win by H lengths . The victory was worth $122,600 to Owner Fuller , 10% of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Proud Clarion and is the first jockey in 66 years to win the Derby twice in a row .
