What are the basic elements of our policy in regard to Goa ? First , there must be peaceful methods . This is essential unless we give up the roots of all our policies and all our behavior . . . We rule out nonpeaceful methods entirely . <P> - Jawaharlal Nehru , 1955 <P> Last week , after years of advocating a policy of nonviolence and lecturing the world-especially the U.S.-about its aggressiveness . India 's Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru went , as he piously put it , " contrary to my grain . ' ' On Nehru 's orders , Indian forces invaded the tiny , 451-year-old Portuguese colony of Goa on India 's west coast . In a three-pronged attack , crack Sikh and Dogra troops of the Indian army 's 17th Division , abetted by gunfire and air force jets , overran Goa and the Portuguese enclaves of Diu and Damao in a naked act of aggression that forever tarnished Nehru 's self-burnished image as an apostle of peace . <P> Hot and Cool . India 's attack followed weeks of jingoistic dissemblance by Nehru @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Prodded by Defense Minister V. K. Krishna Menon and faced with elections in February ( see box ) , Nehru aimed a barrage of inflated and inflammatory charges at the Portuguese . He claimed that Portuguese naval vessels had attacked an Indian fishing boat and an Indian merchant ship , and that well-armed Portuguese troops were " massing menacingly " along the 180-mile Indo-Goan border . Portugal 's colonial authorities , Nehru said , were brutally oppressing the Goan people , most of whom were Hindus who eagerly desired to be reunited with India . <P> Actually , many Goans were cool to the idea of union . Goa was in far better economic condition than India , and was developing huge and profitable iron and manganese deposits in north Goa . Goan businessmen were more fearful of India 's confiscatory taxes and stifling bureaucracy than they were of the petty restrictions of the Portuguese colonial authorities . Union would also end Goa 's virtually duty-free status and the sight of peasant women buying Chanel No. 5 and field hands carrying transistor radios . Goan Christians , who account for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights among India 's 304 million Hindus . <P> Nehru dismissed such reservations . In answer to Portuguese " provocations , " he bivouacked 30,000 troops across the Goan frontier . Both the U.S. and the U.N . rushed to head off the impending conflict . In an ironic reversal of roles , Nehru , who savors the part of international peacemaker , found himself on the opposite side of the table . U.S. Ambassador to India John Kenneth Galbraith four times tried to talk Nehru out of taking military action ; Nehru was not listening . Replying to U.N . Acting Secretary-General U. Thant 's appeal that India and Portugal negotiate their differences , Nehru said : " It is hardly possible to negotiate with a government that takes its stand on 16th century concepts of colonial conquest by force .
