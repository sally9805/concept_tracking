txt WASHINGTON , March 6 ? Something terrible is happening to the Presidential campaign this year . It is all being settled in the press before anybody has had a chance to cast a vote . Most reporters announced Governor Romney 's defeat in New Hampshire weeks before he accepted the press returns and quit . As a result , the New Hampshire election , which came much too early even in the old days when the press waited for the votes to come in , may henceforth have to be held on New Year 's Day if the voters up there want to have any influence on its outcome . Governor Romney had barely finished his adieus , leaving the rest of us happily wringing our hands in anticipation of a splendid battle among the remaining heavyweights , when Newsweek announced that it was all over but the shouting . Richard Nixon , Newsweek 's present issue declares , now has 621 of the 667 votes needed to win the nomination at the convention . Anyone who knows the slightest thing about conventions knows that no man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Nixon has won it . Just to clinch it , The Washington Post telephoned Barry Goldwater Monday to discover what he would do should Governor Rockefeller choose to resist the decision of Newsweek . Goldwater , no doubt sensing that unless he played his cards immediately the press would publish the election results before he could even get a line in the papers , announced that he would refuse to support a Rockefeller ticket . Now , all of us knew that Goldwater would eventually declare that he would not support a Rockefeller ticket . We expected him , however , to refuse to say so until an interesting time in the campaign  --  just before the convention perhaps . Having him say it in March leaves us very little to look forward to . In fact , having the whole Republican campaign concluded by the press in March is a bit like arriving a minute late for the Super Bowl and discovering that the Packers are already ahead by 30 to 0 . In the press , the New Hampshire primary , which will be held next week , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , scheduled for Aug. 5 , may be over any moment now ; and Goldwater 's announcement of opposition to Rockefeller , anticipated for late July , has been registered before the first pussywillows could arrive . The Democrats have also suffered loss of drama from the press 's eagerness to get on with things . Senator Eugene McCarthy had scarcely begun to book airline tickets before the press announced that McCarthy 's campaign against Johnson had failed . Analyses of the factors behind his defeat were published before his campaign was two weeks old . McCarthy , they explained , had failed to " catch fire . " Lightning Warm-Up One problem of campaigning in an age when the press insists upon publishing the result six months before it is scheduled to be made known is that the candidate who can not warm up in a twinkling is sent to the showers before he can even get his track shoes on . Unfortunately for McCarthy , his defeat was reported in January when nobody was looking . This is another unpleasant consequence of having a campaign conducted by the press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural zeal to beat the competition , hold the elections at a time when mostpeople are too worried about ' paying the Christmas bills to , care how they may feel about war and taxes next summer . Ah , you may say , but then% is still Robert Kennedy . Not so . This shows that you were too absorbed in paying the Christmas bills to have noticed the press reports that Kennedy 's prospective plans for taking the nomination from Johnson were doomed . Kennedy , Too , Is Through It took several weeks after ' the press had reported his failure for Kennedy to accept the news , but he has now announced that he is finished . Thus , though not a single vote has been cast anywhere in the country , the nominees  --  Nixon and Johnson  --  have been picked , and the campaign is ready to begin . At least we must hope that it is only ready to begin . We may very well wake up any morning now to read in the ? papers that it is all over . It would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all over , particularly if the eighty million of us wile would like to vote are not even going to be consulted .
