THE DANDY : BRUMMELL TO BEERBOHM ( 372 pp. ) - Ellen Moers-Viking ( $6 ) . <P> The Duke of Wellington approved of elegance , but he felt obliged to advise his splendidly uniformed Grenadier Guards that their behavior was " not only ridiculous but unmilitary " when they rode into battle on a rainy day with their umbrellas raised . Such peacockery startles the 20th century male , who trembles dizzily at the brink of foppishness when he folds a handkerchief into the breast pocket of his sack suit . The rich man of today dresses more plainly , if anything , than his short-form employee , and there are social observers who theorize that the tycoon tries to be inconspicuous because he feels guilty about his wealth . <P> Things were different at the beginning of the 19th century . The eventual winner of the class war , the junior executive , had not even been invented . The upper classes of England , alarmed at Jacobin rumblings from France , put down the undeserving poor with vigor . And one of the battlefields on which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was that of dress . Leading a languid but deadly charge for the aristocracy was a new and resplendent creature , the dandy ( whom the author distinguishes from the mere fop by the social forces that created him ) . Thomas Carlyle wrote unsympathetically that a dandy is " a Man whose trade , office , and existence consist in the wearing of Clothes . " He ignored the dandy 's first function-to prove , merely by being himself , the unbridgeable distance between the elite and " the great unwashed " ( a phrase used by dandified Politician-Author Edward Bul-wer-Lytton to describe literary critics ) . <P> A Superior Valet . First and greatest of the dandies , of course , was George Bryan Brummell . The son of a well-to-do bureaucrat ( he confounded criticism of his birth by claiming that " my father was a very superior valet , and kept his place all his life " ) , Beau Brummell in his teens became the friend of the fat , feckless Prince of Wales . By dressing with unheard-of care and severity-he used only two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waistcoat and trousers-and by developing a haughty silence that could strike like a thunderclap , Brummell made himself the embodiment of bon ton in London society . From 1800 until he fled England to escape creditors in 1816 , " his dictates were obeyed in all the great issues of existence : the curve of a brim , the blend of a snuff , the turn of a phrase , the ways to pass those long boring years when wars were being fought , laws were being debated , history was being made . " <P> Dandyism flourished , exquisite and exclusive , until the passage of the Reform Bill in 1832 ( which shifted the balance of power from the Lords to the Commons ) . Such men as " Poodle " Byng , ' ' Apollo " Raikes , and the gorgeous Count D'Orsay followed or improved upon Brummell 's styles ; collars , stiff with whalebone , rose above the ears , cravats required pounds of starch , and coats became bosomy with padding . French aristocrats , in a wave of Anglophilia , embraced the fad-although , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his county cousin , the fox-hunting buck .
