Neighborly cooperation is a Nordic tradition , and Scandinavia 's parliamentary representatives meet annually to coordinate their countries ' laws . Doctors or teachers can practice anywhere in Scandinavia . Citizens move freely across borders , and criminals sentenced in another country can even serve their jail terms in their homeland . Now , Sweden , Denmark , Norway and Finland are moving to carry their friendship a step further by creating Nordek-a Nordic economic community . <P> Last week Swedish Prime Minister Tage Erlander , a major supporter of Nordek , met at his country estate with President Urho Kekkonen and Prime Minister Mauno Koivisto of Finland . Their decision-to push ahead with the year-old negotiations to bring Nordek into being-reflected a realization that , despite Charles de Gaulle 's departure , Europe is far from becoming one grand market . <P> Nordek will introduce a third grouping into the European economic picture . With a population of 21 million and a combined gross national product of $50 billion , the four countries already constitute the European Common Market 's second largest customer after the U.S. Under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trade Association , * through which four-fifths of intra-Scandinavian trade currently passes duty-free . They plan to establish a customs union that will free all trade among Nordic countries and enact common external tariffs against non-EFTA members . Most important , they will work toward closer economic integration , including completely unrestricted flows of capital across borders . <P> The negotiations mean something different to each of the participants . The Norwegians hope that Nordek will stabilize prices for their troubled fishing industry , which is suffering from growing competition . The Danes look to it for ways to reduce their staggering farm surpluses . The Finns see Nordek as a means of strengthening their commercial ties with the rest of Scandinavia and reducing their uneasy dependence on the Soviet Union . As for the Swedes , they see it as a way of broadening their powerful industrial base and moving deeper into the Russian market by way of Finland . <P> <P> * EFTA members are Denmark , Norway , Sweden , Austria , Switzerland , Portugal and the United Kingdom . Finland is an associate member .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
