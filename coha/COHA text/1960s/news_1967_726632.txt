txt Authoritative state officials reported here today that the New Jersey Racing Commission would approve the application of Jersey Downs Inc. to build a $20-million harness race track in the Secaucus meadows about 10 minutes from midtown Manhattan . High officials reported that only an extraordinary development could alter the commission 's impending decision , which is scheduled to be announced officially tomorrow . The expected approval of Jersey Downs is a victory for New Jersey 's political insiders led by John V. Kenny , the undisputed leader of the powerful Democratic organization in Hudson County , where the track will be situated . The approval will also mean that Hyman N. Glickstein , who controls harness racing on Long Island by virtue of his influence in Roosevelt Raceway , will exert the same infltlence in Northern New Jersey , too , by virtue of his controlling interest in Jersey Downs and his alliance with Mr. Kenny . State Revenue Threatened The commission may also approve the installation of harness racing at the Atlantic City Race Course , ' # : thoroughbred track . The two-track package would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would constitute a majgr threat to the continued prosperity of Yonkers Raceway in New York and cut into the $57-million in state revenue Yonkers and Roosevelt produce each year . A Secaucus track " will empty out Times Square , " predicted a top state official here . A Secaucus track also would represent the culmination of more than 20 years of agitation for horse racing in Northern New Jersey , led primarily by Mr. Kenny 's Hudson organization . Racetrack operators and Hudson County politicians have long coveted a Secaucus site . One of them , Anthony Alessi ? , who is part of the . operation g the Agua Caliente track in Mexico , once remarked : " When you people finally get around to building a racetrack in Secaucus , it 's going to be the biggest money-maker in the world  --  whether you race day or more an acre they expect to have to pay ultimately to the SLATED FOR TODAY state for a clear title represents a state " giveaway . " In addition , they charge that much of Jersey Downs site was reclaimed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mori-Galbreath holdings . Finally , Hudson Racing contends that there is a scarcity of good harness racing horses the e United States . Mr. Robinson says that Roosevelt Raceway , under Mr. Glickstein 's control , could manipulate purses so that Secaucus would only get inferior horses . " Bad horses mean small purses , small crowds and small revenue to the state , " - he said . However , none of these charges seemed to have impressed the commission during its recent public hearings . In fact , commission members repeatedly questioned Hudson ' Racing 's financial sources and the klleged shortcomings of its : proposed site . As for Mr. Kenny and his political organization , the way literally was paved to their site when the New Jersey Turnpike Authority went ahead with its plans last year to widen the turnpike from Woodbridge to Ridgefield Park from six to 12 lanes by building a new spur .

" Old-timers in Hudson Comity like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leanest pigs around a small , makeshift track on warm Saturday evenings . This was before the state , in a move to prevent interstate commerce from abandoning the main route south through Secaucus from New York , drove the pigs and their world-famous aroma from the community in the late 1950 's . The expected victory by Mr. Kenny is hardly a surprise to knowledgeable officials here , from Gov . Richard J. Hughes on down . Almost to a man , top officials from both parties concede that the Hudson Democratic organization was " preordained " to have the final say over which group was approved by the commission . The expected loser to Jersey Downs is the Hudson Racing Association , a group of political outsiders who charged to ? day that the commission 's choice of Jersey Downs and Mr. Glickstein was a " giveaway " of New Jersey 's racing interests to New York operators . Jersey Downs estimates that a track in Secaucus will handle more than $100-million in its first year , adding $8 to $10 million to the $30 million the state reaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also operates tracks in Puerto Rico and West Virginia , has rejected the " giveaway " charge as a " last-minute smear campaign . " Although he conceded that Jersey Downs would be competition for-Roosevelt , which is 36 miles away , he said that this did not necessarily " make for a conflict of interest . " A Conflict on . Conflict " That 's not so , " replied Fred Robinson , a principal figure in the opposing group . " For example , " , he said , " if Glickstein is running a $100,000 feature at Roosevelt , he sure as hell wo n't want to competition from another track ' that night . " . Glickstein 's contention thatMr the New York metropolitan area can support both tracks apparently convinced the commission here because its decision , which by law must be made by Friday , is expected to be unanimous . Right now , there are three thoroughbred race tracks in New Jersey  --  Monmouth Park in Oceanport , Garden State Park in Cherry Hill , and the Atlantic City track . There is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorized the commission to approve up to three more . Since all horse racing in New Jersey has been confined by law to glaylight hours , the allout drive to install a harness track in Secaucus did not really begin until last November , when the state 's Voters , led by Hudson County , overwhelmingly approved night racing in a referendum . Hudson County 's legislative bill to extend the harness racing . season from 60 to 100 days was passed by both houses and signed by the Governor , thus clearing the way for the commission 's consideration of the two Secaucus proposals and seven other applications for tracks elsewhere in the state . Nevertheless , the commission 's anticipated approval does not put Jersey Downs and the Kenny racing colors across the finish line , and therein lies Mr. Kenny 's trump card . decades . Mr. Brogan is a Democrat . Hugh L. Mehorter , a former Assembly Speaker from Gloucester County , has ties to State Senator Frank S. Farley , the powerMl Republican leader in Atlantic County . He is one of the commission 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a retired insurance executive from Short Hills . Despite his Republican label , Mr. Dupuis was ( understood to have been recommended by Mr. Kenny to Governor Hughes , a Democrat , who appoints commissioners to six-year , unsalaried terms . The fourth member is Richard V. Mulligan , , a former Democratic city commissioner in New Brunswick and now a vice president at the Johnson &; Johnson Company , Mr. Mulligan is allied with David T. Wilentz , the influential Democratic national committeeman from New Jersey and the party 's leader in Middlesex County . Along with that , Mr. Mulligan is reputed to be the " governor 's man " on the commission . Powers From Both Parties The commission 's makeup represents the established powers from both parties , which have historically been heavily influenced by the Hudson County political machines that have swung statewide elections . According to informed sources Mr. Kenny has the support of Mr. Mehorter because he , ' in turn , can offer Mr. Farley 's organization in Atlantic County a harness racing operation to bolster sagging revenues at the county 's thoroughbred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hudson Democrats many times during his 30 years in the Senate , led the drive that established racing in his own county . Mr. Kenny is reported to be able to count on Mr. Dupuis because Mr. Dupuis once counted on him . Mr. Kenny can rely on Mr. Mulligan because of his ties with the governor and Mr. Wilentz ? and their ties , in turn , with Mr. Kenny . The apparent support for Mr. Kenny from the three members shapes up as a fait accompli that Mr. Brogan is not expected to dispute since only three votes are needed to approve a track . In fact , the apparent inevitablity of Mr. Kenny 's selection is reflected by state plans to develop the Hacksensack River Meadowlands , which include Secaucus . State maps for the proposed meadowland development include a race track ( euphemistically designated as a " Sports , Exhibition , Entertainment Complex " ) right on the spot picked by Mr. Ken* and Jersey Downs . If Jersey Downs is the brainchild of Mr. Kenny , it is the direct descendant of Hague , whose heirs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hague lieutenant , in 1949 . The Jersey Downs 's application for a Secaucus track in enclosed in a brown manila folder in the commission 's office here . The application shows that Jersey Downs proposes to build a track that will cost from $18 to $20 million on a 254-acre tract in the northeast section for a Secaucus track is could hold 30,000 persons , 10,000 cars , a stable for 1,000 horses , and open by May , 1969 . The Jersey Downs site is part of a 773-acre tract jointly owned by Eugene Mori , who operates Garden State Park and Hialeah Park in Florida , and John W. Galbreath , the wealthy sportsman and owner of the Pittsburgh Pirates . The application states that Jersey Downs is the wholly owned subsidiary of the Greater Hudson Corporation , whose president is Thomas E. Lynch , a prominent Jersey City lawyer and bank dirctor . Mr. Lynch was a law partner of the late Gov . A. Harry Moore . Mr. Lynch is the executive vice president of Yonkers Raceway and is an old ally of Mr. Kenny . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the Atlantic Eastern Corporation , which owns 76 per cent of the stock worth $7.6-million . In turn , Atlantic East , ern is a wholly owned subsidiary of the San Juan Racing Association , which operates El Commandante in Puerto Rico . San Juan is controlled by a syndicate headed by Mr. Glickstein . The Jersey Downs application shows further that Mr. Lynch has an option to purchase the Mori-Galbreath property for $7.7-million or rent it for 15-year periods at a sliding scale rate of from $150,000 to $450 , - 000 a year , beginning Jan. 1 . Mr. Lynch told the commission that he would resign as executive vice president of Yonkers when the Jersey Downs proposal ? was finally approved . The application also shows that the track site originates from a real estate deal made by Mr. Mori and Hague in 1944 , when Hague was still in power . Papers show that Hague 's lawyers , at his and Mr. Mori 's request , immediately began to " assemble a tract in Secaucus for a racetrack . " After Hague 's death in 1956 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Mr. Mori , he was precluded from heading a Secaucus track syndicate because state law barred , anyone from controlling more than one track in New Jersey . While Jersey Downs proposes a track on the northeast corner of Secaucus , the rival Hudson Racing Association proposes a track on a 259-acre site in the southwest corner . Voters Have Final Say Final approval of any track rests with the voters in Seacaucus and Hudson County in the upcoming November election . Since Mr. Kenny 's organization can regulate elections much like a general staff can regulate the deployment of troops , he can veto the commission 's choice . Along with his veto power in the referendum , Mr. Kenny can command the support of the established political forces , in New Jersey . That power base has been translated into support for him within the bipartisan racing commission . The commission 's chairman is Thomas J. Brogan , a wealthy car dealer in Northern New , Jersey . His membership is ' reputed to have resulted , in part , from his ties to the late Frank ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hudson County and New Jersey politics for two A major figure in the Hudson group is Harry A. Robinson , a Philadelphia real estate operator , who tried to obtain an option on the Mori-Galbreath property before offering his 259-acre tract , which once belonged to the late lames J. Colt . Before Mr. Kenny solidified his control in Hudson , he was reported to have considered developing a track on the Colt site . Moreover , Mr. Kenny and Mr. Robinson have been friends for years . Their prior association led many observers to speculate that Hudson racing was Mr. Kenny 's " backup " choice , should Jersey DoWns be disqualified . According to Hudson Racing , one reason why Jersey Downs should be disqualified is Mr. , Lynch 's position at Yonkers , where he has been earning.up to $40,000 annually since 1954 . Fred Robinson of Hudson Racing questioned how Mr. Lynch could go ahead with a Secaucus venture knowing that it eventually would cut deeply into the ' Yonkers draw from northern ? New Jersey and New York . Riparian Rights at Issue Another argument made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question of who actually owns Ore meadowlands . The state claims an over-all riparian interest in all meadlowlands that are or ever were coveted by tidal water regardless of existing titles . The state Supreme Court is now considering the state 's claim . Hudson Racing contends that it has ? already gained ' a clear title to its site while Jersey Downs 's title could be later challenged in court . Furthermore , Hudson charges that the difference between the $25,000 an acre , Mr. Mori and Mr. Gal- Dapper Heir-Apparent The turnpike 's executive director is William J. Flanagan , the dapper heir-apparent to Mr. Kenny in Hudson County . When the expansion is completed , the existing roadway will virtually serve as a direct route to Jersey Downs from Bergen County and the George Washington Bridge . But perhaps most important , a new track in Secaucus guarantees that Mr. Kenny will control more than 500 jobs at the track . Hudson Democrats consider jobs more important than money because once money is gone , it 's gone ; a job lingers on . With this in mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a track in Secaucus . He was repeatedly opposed by the state 's newspapers , church leaders and civic organizations . He was stymied by Gov . Alfred E. Driscoll , a Republican who opposed Acing on moral grounds , and by Gov . Robert B. Meyner , a Democrat who opposed Mr. Kenny on political grounds . With the election of Governor Hughes in 1961 , Mr. Kenny finally found a friend in the Governor 's office . However , according " to informed sources , Mr. Hughes prevailed upon Mr. Kenny to . hold up his push for a track until after the , guberna torial election in 1965.
