The religion debate spread from pulpit to press to public . Some comments : <P> BOSTON HERALD : <P> <P> Can the voters , in weighing Mr. Kennedy 's qualifications , ignore his Catholicism ? Can they ignore Mr. Nixon 's Quaker persuasion ? They obviously ca n't . A man is the sum of all the influences at work on him and in him . Religion is an important influence . But in the political context , it is not , and must not be allowed to become , all-important . <P> <P> DETROIT NEWS : <P> <P> We believe that Kennedy has answered all of the relevant questions satisfactorily and that they should no longer be asked . <P> <P> CINCINNATI ENQUIRER : <P> Bigotry works two ways . It is bigotry to oppose a man for public office because of his religious faith . But it is also bigotry to accuse those who oppose him for valid political reasons of acting out of prejudice . <P> <P> DETROIT FREE PRESS : <P> There are occasions when it seems as though Kennedy or his supporters welcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time until the end of the campaign , Senator Kennedy would be wise in taking the position that he has said all that needs to be said about religion . <P> <P> MURRAY KEMPTON , writing in the NEW YORK POST : <P> <P> The religious issue has already cost Jack Kennedy all the votes it can ; the widespread disgust it has aroused can only help him from now on . He would be a fool not to keep it going . <P> <P> JAMES RESTON , writing in the NEW YORK TIMES : <P> <P> It is , of course , true that many people in Texas sincerely oppose Kennedy for both economic and religious reasons . But it also happens to be true that it is easier , and cheaper , to defeat him here among the working class voters with religious rather than economic arguments . <P> <P> ROSCOE DRUMMOND , writing in the NEW YORK HERALD-TRIBUNE : <P> <P> To try to make a voter 's opposition to Kennedy proof of bigotry is itself a form of bigotry . <P> <P> DORIS FLEESON : <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chancellor Adenauer , good Catholics both , to hear from America that a Catholic can not be trusted to lead a democratic nation . <P> <P> GEORGE E. SOKOLSKY : <P> The campaign will proceed as expected . It is likely to be one of the dirtiest in history . <P> <P> THE CHRISTIAN CENTURY , nondenominational Protestant weekly : <P> A time of sudden deterioration of the international position of the United States is not a time to magnify out of all proportion an issue which could fatally divide America . It is Khrushchev , not the pope , who is coming to the United Nations . <P> <P> WORLD OUTLOOK , a Methodist monthly magazine : <P> We do not know whether to vote against or for a man simply because he is a member of a group is bigotry or not . But it undoubtedly is bad politics and worse religion . <P> <P> REGISTER , national Catholic weekly : <P> The Republican candidate should denounce the support of the political parsons with as much vigor and decision as that with which Abraham Lincoln disowned Know-Nothing support in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations : <P> Both religion and democracy are downgraded when religion is used as a weapon of partisan political warfare . <P>
