txt Representative Adam Clayton Powell Jr . was criticized in the House today as a spendthrift in the use of funds appropriated to the Education and Labor Committee , which he heads . A Republican member of the committee , Representative John Ashbrook of Ohio , scored the New York Democrat 's stewardship of committee funds on a number of grounds . He was particularly critical of the expenditures for operation of the committee 's New York office and of the large amount of travel to Puerto Rico . Mr. Powell maintains a home in Puerto Rico . Phone Bills Entered Mr. Ashbrook said that . his study of the available records indicated that , over the last 18 months , 30 trips had been made to Puerto Rico at committee expense , either by Mr. Powell or by members of the committee . or staff . In the same period , the cornmitee has reimbursed Mr. Powell personally for travel and per diem expenses for 20 trips out of Washington . The sums have varied from $25 to $192 . In most instances the destination of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Ashbrook also entered in the record a tabulation of payments to the New York Telephone Company of $2,500 during 1962 and a part of 1961 to cover the account of the com mittee 's New York office . The Ohio Republican prefaced his remarks by asserting that he was offended by Mr. Powell 's statement at a news conference last week that , in his handling of committee funds , he was doing no more than other Congressmen and committee chairmen do . " I object to the reference that we all practice this type of activity , " Mr. Ashbrook told the House . " I certainly would not , nor would many members of the House , and yet the impression is given that this is the standard routine for all of us . " I believe that the reputation of this august body is at stake . " More than 100 members Were I present during the half hour that Mr. Ashbrook spoke . Mr. Powell was not among them , although he had been advised that his conduct of committee business would come under open attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his office said that he had left for the day . Attacked in Senate Last week , the New Yorker was attacked on somewhat similar grounds by Senator John J. Williams , Republican of Delaware . At a news conference . after that incident Mr. Powell said that he regarded all such attacks on him as base &; on the fact that he is a Negro . In addition to being a 10-term , member of the House and a leading Democratic figure in , New York , Mr. Powell is pastor of the Abyssinian Baptist Church with a congregation estimated to total 11,000 . Earlier today Mr. Ashbrook appeared before the House Ad- , ministration Committee , which passes on the request of the ' legislative committees for operating funds . Mr. Powell had requested an appropriation of $697,000 for the two years of the current Congress , an increase of $65,000 over the appropriation for the last biennium . The Ohio Republican urged the Administration committee to reduce that request " by at least $200,000 . " Later , he told the House : " It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money has been expended by this committee . " The Congress is always talk- of ing about economy . It could of well turn its attention on this of committee . Close scrutiny of its payroll , consultant fees , contracts , telephone and travel would , in my judgment , lead to a cut of some $200,000 and bring its expenditures drat to a realistic figure . " Appropriations Increased Mr. Ashbrook noted that the appropriations to the committee have risen from $120,000 in the 85th Congress to $633,000 at the beginning of the 87th Congress two years ago . At the earlier date , the committee 's staff numbered 16 , he said , whereas last year the number varied between 40 and 50 . As to travel , Mr. Ashbrook said that the Education and Labor Committee " had less reason to travel than any other committee in Congress . " But the figures show that such was not the case , " he continued . " Our expensive domestic travel was matched by our overseas travel . The Congressional record . . . indicates that $21,272 of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1961 . " He cited as " a typical example of a questionable trip " one made last year by John Young 3d , a New York public relations man who has been carried on the committee pay roll as a consultant . Mr. Ash brook said that Mr. Young last year made a 30-day " cultural tour of South America " that cost the committee $1,000 for transportation and $2,000 for , meals and lodgings , in addition to his consultant 's fee of $1,000 . Mr. Ashbrook complained about the unavailability of detailed reports on most committee travel , and chided Congress for its lack of self-discipline in regulating such questionable practices . " We consistently denounce waste and duplication in the executive branch of Government , " he said . " But a cloak secrecy covers all too much what we do in this branch Government .
