Maybe Kansas State really does have a " super , super , super , super " quarterback , which is the way Coach Vince Gibson modestly describes Lynn Dickey , the lad who made big sport of Oklahoma last week . And maybe Colorado 's exuberant Bob Anderson really is so splendid a runner that kindly old ladies baked him cakes after he bounced his pals past Missouri . In the big Big Eight anything can happen  --  and already has . Just when it had begun to look as if college football would get through a season without any mind-boggling upsets , here came this Dickey and this Anderson to throw their conference into such confusion that it may take weeks to unravel the knots . Let it be restated that those were n't printer 's errors . Kansas State , which has been back on the farm since about 1934 , giggled at the powerful Sooners 59-21 , and Colorado , which has the audacity to run wind sprints after a game , stuck it on unbeaten Missouri 31-24. // What all of this accomplished was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's strongest conferences . There was lots of talk about the Big Eight before last Saturday , because the league had gone 16-8 against outside teams , fattening itself largely on Big Ten schools to the tune of 6-0 . The Southeastern Conference could claim a superior intersectional record ( 25-5 ) , but the Dixie teams had hardly left Dixie . The Big Eight not only whomped the Big Ten , it knocked off some pretty good independents in Air Force , Houston and Syracuse . And now , as they settled down to play their conference friends , the teams that had looked like the Big Eight 's best  --  Missouri and Oklahoma  --  were suddenly in trouble in what has to be the liveliest conference race in the land . // The situation is this : unexpected Kansas State , thanks to Lynn Dickey 's passing arm and the wisdom of Vince Gibson , who just might be thinking himself into coach of the year , stands at 3-0 . But Colorado , Missouri , Oklahoma and Nebraska all have only one loss , and there are bunches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State miracleworkers must go to seething Missouri this week , and Colorado must visit Nebraska . In the future there are Missouri-Oklahoma and Kansas State-Nebraska and Nebraska-Oklahoma , not to forget what might be the biggest of all on Nov. 22 when Bob Anderson takes Colorado into the forgotten nest of Manhattan , Kans. , where only 35,000 seats are available for the big showdown with Lynn Dickey. // That would be a fitting place to end the race , for last week both Kansas State and Colorado got the victories they really wanted , and it was those upsets that caused all of the confusion anyhow . // A while back , the day before his team was to play high-ranked Penn State , and eight days before it would take on archrival Kansas , Vince Gibson sat at his desk by his purple and white telephone and said , " Beating Penn State would give us national prestige , and we do n't have a bigger game than Kansas , but the game I want is Oklahoma . " Small wonder Gibson wanted it . In 35 years Kansas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 34 losses , most of them by thoroughly humiliating scores . // The Wildcats narrowly lost to Penn State ( 14-17 ) , clipped Kansas ( 26-22 ) and went into the Oklahoma game with a 4-1 record and an astonishing lack of respect for the Sooners. // " We 've got a better team than Oklahoma , " Gibson told his boys . " They 've got tradition , but we are n't awed by that . They make mistakes in their secondary , and we can get to them . " // Lynn Dickey got to them , all right . A junior who wears white shoes because Joe Namath does , Dickey scattered passing records all over Manhattan as he hurled 28 completions for 380 yards and three touchdowns . He got the Wildcats on top quickly by 14-0 . When the Sooners closed it to 14-7 on a long pass by Jack Mildren , Dickey came back throwing to make it 21-7 . Another Mildren bomb made it 21-14 , but Oklahoma never got closer . Before the half was over , Dickey had again driven Kansas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarter K State held a delirious 49-14 margin . // It was in the last quarter that OU 's bruising Steve Owens got his 13th touchdown of the year and gained more than 100 yards for the 14th game in a row , all of which would be fairly impressive if it were n't for Kansas State 's 59 points and 535 yards of total offense. // The big day for undernourished Kansas State was best summed up by one of its broadcasters , Paul DeWeese , who told OU fans , " It 's no fun getting clobbered like this , and we are just the people to know how it feels . " // Colorado , meanwhile , knew how it felt a year ago to get physically clobbered by Missouri in Columbia . The score did n't hurt so much . It was only 27-14 . But the Tigers battered the Buffs around for a total of six concussions . Last week Bob Anderson , aided by a tough front four on defense , got revenge out in Boulder . Missouri could count about nine disabled Tigers as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // There are several things to understand about Anderson . First , he was a rollout quarterback for two seasons ( leading the Big Eight in total offense last year ) and for the first two games of 1969 . But then Coach Eddie Crowder secretly shifted him to tailback , believing Anderson might be all that Oklahoma 's Steve Owens is . Perhaps Crowder is right . With the 132 yards he cranked out of Missouri , Anderson now has 704 yards for the year  --  71 more than Owens  --  and with his two touchdowns against Missouri he has just as many as the Sooner star ( 13 ) , which makes them tied for the nation 's scoring lead at 78 points , along with Jim Braxton of West Virginia . Anderson 's two touchdowns also broke Whizzer White 's career scoring total at Colorado , as if it had n't been a tough enough year for the Supreme Court already . // Anderson is a strong ballcarrier , much on the order of Owens and almost as big at 208 and 6 feet . He bashes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off defenders like a fish flipping out of a boat . He also dates a former pompon girl , has an older brother , Dick , who made All-America on defense for the Buffs two years ago , and is so intense a competitor that it was his idea , along with Colorado 's other two captains , to lead the team in wind sprints in the end zone after every game  --  win or lose . // After the first few minutes there was little question about Missouri 's fate at Boulder . Anderson 's runs got his team off to a 10-0 lead , and when Missouri got back in the game on a 75-yard pass from erratic Terry McMillan to Mel Gray , the Buffs struck just as promptly . Paul Arendt , a substitute quarterback and another of those good sophomores who seem to be everywhere , passed 79 yards to Monte Huber to put the Buffs ahead by 17-7 . When Missouri cut that margin , Colorado scored again behind Arendt . And when Missouri came back again , Colorado , with Anderson bolting over everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win that a little old lady greeted Anderson outside the dressing room with a homemade cake , presented it and said , " You 've just done so much for me. " // Apparently , one of the best decisions Crowder ever made at Colorado was to move Anderson to tailback . Anderson 's throwing had never been quite satisfactory , but he was always a devastating runner . Crowder made the switch the week of the Indiana game in the most fascinating of ways . In workouts Anderson ran at tailback , but he wore another number . The quarterback , in turn , wore Anderson 's number . This was just in case there were any spies peering down from the Flatirons , the mountain range that overlooks Colorado 's scenic campus , a campus so noted for fun that coeds have been known to attend summer school there from the University of Hawaii , and so casual about recreation that a homecoming banner last week asked fans to PUT A TIGER IN YOUR PIPE . // It is no secret anymore that Bob Anderson is situated at running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least one-fourth of " super-super-super-super , " so , regardless of what fans are smoking out in Boulder or Manhattan , the whole Big Eight is more than slightly on fire .
