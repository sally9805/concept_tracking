txt Astronauts Charles Conrad Jr . and Alan L. Bean may have helped heal the breach between lunar scientists and the space agency . Their workmanlike performance has shown the potential value of using men to explore the moon . This pleases scientists , who have monitored their work from here . It also hones their desire for more . It shows that researchers may indeed have much to gain from cooperating fully with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) in developing a program for explorational research . Milestones ' noted " The people who wonder at the involvement of man in this program must have learned a few lessons , " remarked Dr. Gary Latham of Columbia University shortly after the astronauts had left the lunar stir-face . " The ability of the man to correct faults , which you do n't do by automation very handily , was clearly in evidence . " ' ( As of this writing , the astronauts were preparing for their splashdown in ' the Pacific . ) Dr. Eugene Shoemaker , of the California Institute ' of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . said ' the astronauts had " set many milestones ih terms of learning how to use men in exploratory activities . And they have set a pace , and a style that will certainly mean that the future missions will not only reach that but hopefully go beyond it . So , it 's gone extremely well . " Instrument work praised On Apollo 11 's mission last July , scientists had trouble getting their instructions relayed to the astronauts . This time , things went much more smoothly . Dr. Latham said that evPryone concerned seemed aware of the importance ofiscientists working directly with the astronauts on the lunar surface . It has been a matter of learning how to do it . Problems that interfered with this during Apollo 11 were , he said , " entirely gone . " While on the moon , the astronauts , for example , threw stones so Dr. Latham and colleagues could check the working of the seismometer . They rechecked some of the other instruments when data received here suggested there might be problems . Dr. Johannes Geiss , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been particularly helpful in setting up his experiment . This was the metal foil that was opened to catch electrically charged particles coming from the sun . It was tricky to unfurl and took astronaut help . // *Toward a lunar science // In many such ways the astronauts showed their value in setting up instruments , in scouting out and collecting rock and dust samples , and in describing the terrain they explored . Such activities , expanded in a carefully planned way , could make men on the moon valuable working partners in scientific exploration . They could go far beyond the capability of remotely controlled , robot systems . Even Dr. Shoemaker , who recently announced his resignation from the NASA program , admitted he was impressed . While the astronauts really did nothing that had n't long been anticipated , they did it so well that he called it " a good first step " toward a really meaningful manned moon program . But he added that NASA still " has to go a lot further to prove that putting men on the moon really pays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Dr. Shoemaker added . But he said that NASA should back it up with a determined effort to really put man to work . Men can do much more than just pick up rocks and discover how much fun moon walking is , said Dr. Shoemaker . He added that he would like to see the agency " put man on the moon and put him there for a week . " Sharp criticism recalled Last October , in announcing his resignation , he had criticized the Apollo program as virtually a dead-ended space race with the Russians . Having won that moon race , he said , it has ended up with " a transportation system that lets man go to the moon but does not let him explore it . " Since then , NASA seems to have been trying very hard to cooperate with the scientists . It reoriented the priorities for this mission to please them . The pinpoint landing near Surveyor had been a secondary objective . But it assumed first importance as a demonstration of ability on later flights to land exactly where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astronauts have seemed eager to proclaim that they were serving science , not just carrying out a space adventure . Dr. Shoemaker , like other scientists here , appeared to be responding to this extended hand of cooperation . Asked about his resignation , he said that it was due as much to exhaustion as to protest . He has been heavily involved in NASA work for a decade , since the days of the crash-landing Ranger spacecraft that photographed the moon . This long service has been very demanding . " I 'm tired , " he said , as he explained this . Questioned on future Would he consider returning to the program if he felt it offered a better research opportunity in the future ? " If it were possible for an individual scientist to come in and do a useful project , yes , I think I would consider returning , " he said . He added , " I 'm not saying there 's something seriously wrong with the system , so much as it is just a big system that demands too much of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your whole life . . . . I 'm under no illusion that anything can be done about it quickly . It wo n't be easy to change . " But , given the will on the part of both NASA and scientists , Dr. Shoemaker said he thinks man-on-the ? moon offers a tremendously challenging opportunity for lunar exploration in the 1970 's . Thus , in talking with him and others here , there 's a feeling of a softening of the estrangement between the lunar scientists and NASA that was so widely reported after Apollo 11 . NASA still has a lot of proving to do , from the scientists ' viewpoint . It has to show it means what it says about giving scienists high priority by doing its utmost to make Apollo mission scientifically meaningful . To the extent it was possible , NASA has tried to do this with the Apollo 12 flight . Much credit goes to the astronauts . As Dr. Shoemaker noted , what they did had been long anticipated . But the style with which they did it was impressive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they left behind . They showed an eagerness to get samples and explore lunar features which would have the most value for the scientists . " I think all of us are very much gratified at the performance of those astronauts , " Dr. Latham said .
