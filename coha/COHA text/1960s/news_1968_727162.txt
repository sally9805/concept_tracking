txt West Germany is deeply concerned over East Germany 's latest effort to make it more expensive to maintain West Berlin as an isolated outpost behind the Iron Curtain . Chancellor Kurt Georg Kiesinger flew to Berlin June 13 and promised West Berliners that larger federal subsidies soon will be on their way from Bonn , perhaps by the end of June . These subsidies will be designed to recompense individual West Berliners for the higher freight and visa charges which Communist East Germany has just imposed on traffic to and from Berlin . Generous terms Meanwhile , travelers trying to cross East German territory by the overland routes to Berlin reported traffic tie-ups lasting hours , as East German border guards began to implement the new visa and freight regulations . Dr. Kiesinger spoke in Berlin of effective countermeasures soon to be taken , perhaps in the realm of interzonal trade or travel restrictions on East Germans wishing to visit the West . Here the Chancellor was cautious , however . Bonn , he said , wanted to take no measures that would injure individual East Germans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , traditionally offers // *West Germans weigh Berlin countermoves // generous terms in interzonal trade as one way to raise the living standards of 17 million East Germans . A practical ? but very minor ? countermeasure would be for the Allied travel board in West Berlin to refuse visa requests by East German trade officials who had business to transact in NATO countries . Dr. Kiesinger declared his government expected the Western Allies ? the United States , Britain , and France  --  to take " serious countermeasures " against East Germany . It was not excluded that Foreign Minister Willy Brandt , currently on a trip to Yugoslavia , would fly to Washington to work out details with Secretary of State Dean Rusk . West Germany summoned its Ambassador , Helmut Allardt , home from Moscow Friday for consultations on the Berlin situation , the Associated Press reported . Greater efforts pledged As usual , Chancellor Kiesinger flew from Bonn to Berlin in a United States Air Force plane  --  a converted C-118 . No West German aircraft , either civil or military , is allowed to fly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and French aircraft have this right . Traditionally high West German officials choose American military planes in which to make their flights to the isolated city . " In the future , " Dr. Kiesinger declared , " we will do even more to engage ourselves in Berlin . " Everything would be done to demonstrate that West Berlin belonged to the Federal Republic . On June 17 Dr. Kiesinger will preside over a special Cabinet meeting to prepare a new version of the existing Berlinhilfgesetz ( Berlin aid law ) . This will be rushed to Parliament to be passed before summer vacation begins . Measures applauded It is known , for example , that West German investors willing to build housing and industrial plants in West Berlin will receive much larger tax write-offs and depreciation allowances than heretofore . But more federal aid for West Berliners does nothing to erase the latest Communist measures . Most observers see little realistic hope of doing so , since the Soviet Union has given its blessing to Eist Berlin . Izvestia , the Soviet Government news- paper , applauded the East @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as serving to strengthen the sovereignty of East Germany . Without Soviet backing , there is little that the Western powers can do , other than confront East German officials with military power at checkpoints and escort West Germans through the 110 miles of East German territory that separate West Germany from Berlin . No one is prepared to do this . In fact , nowhere on paper have the allies committed themselves to guarantee free and unhindered transit rights to West Germans  --  only to allied personnel . The maze of four-power agreements fashioned by the Soviet Union and the three Western allies after World War II were designed to apply to a temporarily divided Germany . Once the division became frozen , and the Soviets gave sovereignty to East Germany , including in it East Berlin , the Western allies were reduced to protecting allied rights in the western part of the city . Neither Moscow nor East Berlin shows any sign of directly challenging allied rights . The Communist aim is to make the position of West Berlin ultimately untenable , by wearing the Germans down . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more Walter Ulbricht 's East German regime is likely to nibble away at the Germans in Berlin . Bonn 's diplomatic relations with Romania and now with Yugoslavia were bad enough . What currently disturbs East Berlin is the flirtation between West Germany and Czechoslovakia . Mr. Ulbricht finds his government more and more isolated within the Communist camp , with only the Soviet Union and Poland firm allies today . One place where Mr. Ulbricht can strike back effectively at the West Germans , whom he regards as undermining East Germany in Eastern Europe , is through West Berlin . This he now has done . For the West to roll back the situation will be hard , if possible at all . Meanwhile , West German travelers will have to endure long waits at the border and the stamping of East German visas in their passports . Chancellor Kiesinger 's promise of more federal aid for West Berlin means in effect that West German taxpayers will foot the bill for the extra charges which East Germany is levying on traffic to and from Berlin .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
