txt The Airport Sales corporation 's monopoly on sale of air travel insurance at O'Hare International airport was terminated by resolution of the city council yesterday . The resolution was submitted by Mayor Daley , who said the company had signed an agreement waiving its right to sell the insurance exclusively . The move cleared the way for Tele-Trip Insurance company , a subsidiary of Mutual of Omaha , to negotiate ' with the city for the right to sell trip insurance at the big air terminal . Sought Share of Sales The company futilely sought a part of the business before Airport Sales , a subsidiary of Continental Casualty company , was given a seven year exclus- , ive contract for sale of the insurance by the city council last July 28 . In a strange side development , Mayor Daley named a special council committee which conducted a hearing of 2 hours 40 minutes later in the day to determine whether there was conflict of interest involving Aid . Thomas E. Keane 31st . The committee concluded there was no evidence of any conflict of interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairman of the finance committee , and an attorney for Continental Casualty company since 1938 ? eight years bef or e he was elected an alderman . Name Three Republicans The committee included Ald. Leon M. Despres 5th , independent , and Aldermen Nicholas J. Bohling 7th and Jack I. Sperling 50th , Republicans . Daley also named the only other minority alderman , John J. Hoellen 47th , a Republican , to the committee , but he was out of the city . Despres proposed establishing the committee , but it was Keane who asked that Daley name only the minority aldermen and called for the hearing in the afternoon . Keane said he received a retainer from Continental Casualty of $12,000 a year , and was paid more if he did more work than the retainer covered . He denied he ever did work for Airport Sales . He said he did not talk with anyone in the city administration about the contract , which came to his committee . It was referred to a subcommittee headed by Ald. John E. Egan 13th , which rec -- I ommended approval . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Tele-Trip had made an offer for the business . He said he made no secret of his work foil Continental Casualty . Meets Four . Minutes " If I had felt there was a conflict of interest I would have so stated , " Keane said . " There was no conflict . " The special committee , after four minutes in executive session in Keane 's private office , with Keane outside , issued this statement : " Under the evidence presented to us , we find no basis for innuendoes as to any improper conduct in the ' matter under consideration . We will ' prepare a written report with recommendations for the city council . " ' The council had referred to " the aviation committee , " headed by Egan , a resolution by Bohling asking an inquiry . Bohling said Wiliam E. Downes Jr. , commissioner of aviation , should have informed the finance committee last year of Tele-Trip 's offers . Negotiate Guarantees Eliminating the exclusive feature of the agreement with Airport Sales means the city will negotiate with that company regarding minimum guarantees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receive 25 per cent of gross premiums paid , - with guarantee of $75,000 this year and gradual increases up to $110,000 in 1967 . The department of aviation also will negotiate with TeleTrip , which bad offered to pay the city 25 per cent of premiums it receives . Last year Tele-Trip ' offered to sell the maximum of $150,000 of insurance - for $3.75 , compared with $5 charged for this amount of insurance by Airport Sales . Daley told the council TeleTrip had agreed to sell the $150,000 of insurance for $3.75 on a noncompetitive basis , which meant Airport Sales apparently must reduce its price . Low Rate Seen It appeared the developments here would give O'Hare patrons a lower rate for $150,000 than prevails at most airports . Downes said the charge is $5 for the $150,000 coverage at every other major airport except Washington , D. C. This is the rate charged by both companies at Midway airport . Both companies charge $2.50 for $75,000 of insurance , the amount most frequently bought here and elsewhere , Keane said . " We 've just witnessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolution was approved , " and it is good to see public officials rise above criticism . The great result is a credit to you , Mr. Mayor , and Me commissioner of aviation . " Bohling Praises Move Bohling praised the m o v e , too , but added , as he introduced his resolution calling for committee investigation , " I do feel there was a dereliction of duty by the department of aviation in not presenting all the facts to us when they presented the Airport Sales agreement to the finance subcommittee last summer . " Sperling termed it " a great break for the public , " saying Airport Sales no doubt would reduce its fees and air travelers apparently will be able to obtain $300,000 of coverage by purchasing a policy from each company . Despres ' proposal for establishing the special committee to delve into Keane 's role came after the council had turned to other matters . Keane Assailed Despres accused Keane of " personal vindictiveness " in having a proposal involving Despres ' ward referred back to the finance committee , instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorization to the South Park Improvement association to take water from fire hydrants for use in cleaning streets  --  a matter usually approved as routine . Keane said , " If the alderman wants to make specific charges of vindictiveness I 'll answer them . " Despres rose on a point of personal privilege to ask appointment of the special committee . Keane asked Daley to dame the committee , with the minority aldermen as its members .
