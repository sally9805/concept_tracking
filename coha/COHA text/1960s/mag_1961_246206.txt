After any military coup d'etat , the danger point comes when the zealous soldiers run out of ideas and into the hard facts of reality . It is then that they begin to quarrel and plot against one another . Last week , after only a month and a half , South Korea 's military revolution was already devouring its own offspring . Out went Junta Boss Lieut . General Chang <P> Do Yung , front man for the new regime . In came Major General Pak Chung Hi , Chang 's former " deputy " and the real strongman behind the May coup . <P> Ostensibly , General Chang quit of his own free will . " The foundations of a revolutionary regime have been to a degree established , " the military Premier announced . " I am voluntarily resigning , since I realize the urgent need of a more aggressive leader who will be able to carry out stronger policies . " In fact , his retirement had been hastened by a truckload of Pak 's troops , who swooped onto General Chang 's home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Seoul 's capitol building . Getting the point , General Chang called an emergency cabinet meeting and made his announcement . Then , with three other members of the junta , the hapless general vanished from sight , presumably to take up residence in sprawling Mapo prison . <P> The Enigma . At 44 , tough , hawk-faced little General Pak is an enigma , little known either to South Koreans or to the U.S. officers who , through the U.N . Korea Command , train , equip and largely control the tough , 600,000-man ROK army . A career officer who was trained in Japanese military schools , Pak was court-martialed for Communist activities as a South Korean officer in 1948 , escaped with his life to become an anti-Communist-and the ROK army 's chief of operations . He speaks little English , never made the study tour of U.S. military camps that has been the usual path to success for ROK officers . <P> To reassure the U.S. top brass , Pak named a U.S. favorite as new Premier in General Chang 's place . He is retired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 43 , who as army chief of staff in May , 1960 , pressured old President Syngman Rhee into resigning without a blood bath , then held the rioting students at bay until the nation calmed down . Song retired soon thereafter , has been studying politics and economics at George Washington University in Washington , D.C. Last month the junta generals called him back to South Korea to serve as the new regime 's Defense Minister . <P> The Other Chang . So far , the junta generals had been devoting themselves mainly to arrests of prostitutes , jaywalkers , hooligans , and harassment of suspected Communists , liberals and corrupt politicians . Pak 's first major move after taking over was to set off in full cry after the liberals again . Announcing a new law providing penalties up to death for Communist collaborators , the junta arrested former Premier John Chang and seven of his Democratic Party Cabinet ministers who were in his Cabinet before the May 16 coup , labeling them " proCommunist plotters . " Although John Chang is a Catholic and a well-known antiCommunist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " by contributing the sum of $770 to a South Korean relief society .
