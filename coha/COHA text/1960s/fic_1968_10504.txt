" Would you kill him ? " " I do n't know . " " In that case , someone will have to kill him for you . " In confusion , frustration , and anger , I cried out , " I would kill him if I had to ! " Abruptly , he swung around in the seat to face me . I felt his eyes boring into me . But he did not speak . It was only when I drove our jeep into the headquarters of the 34th Division that he said , matterof-factly , " When we go back to the Corps , I want you to get ready to go to Tokyo . I 'll have Colonel McKay arrange for the trip . Is that clear ? "  |p51Halfway  up the driveway toward a cluster of buildings which comprisedthe headquarters of the 34th Division , headlights shone suddenlyout of foggy darkness ahead and a jeep came toward us splashing muddy water . I stopped our jeep by the side of the driveway . We both got out . The other jeep came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Division commander , leaped out . He was alone . " Good to see you both , " he said . " The sentry at the gate reported you just passed through . " The thirty-six-year-old general , an old friend of Colonel Min 's from their days in Tokyo , had been the chief of staff at the Corps until the month before . Stocky and rather jovial , he sported an American-style crew cut . " I am glad you did n't bring the others . It would n't have done any good . Only would have gotten them all raving mad . " " Where is he now ? " said Colonel Min . " Would you believe it 1 He 's at the firing range , target practicing1 " I could not help swearing under my breath . " I 've had enough of him , " said General Yoon ; then in English , " Goddamn 1 "  | " So  --  that 's where he wants to see me , " said Colonel Min , " at the firing range ? Is he drunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am getting tired of babying him . Cousin or no cousin , just give me the word and I 'll break his bullyingguts . I can keep him here under guard till we are through with the coup . As far as his headquarters are concerned , he has gone fishing in the mountains , ha , ha , ha ! Goddamn it , we do n't need him around messing up our work . " " That wo n't be necessary , " said Colonel Min . " Besides , we do need him on our side or at least we have to neutralize him . As you know , he has cronies in key positions around Seoul and until we can replace them with our people , we have to go softly . We do n't want a senseless civil war on our hands , do we ? " " Well , I see what you mean , " said General Yoon . " How about the Marines and the Air Force , Major ? " " All set , General . As far as the Marines are concerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Air Force , according to my latest count , can give us four fighter squadrons at Kimpo , one bomber wing at Suwon , and enough transport planes from Taegue to airlift one of your regiments from Chunchun . But you 've got to make it to Chunchun without resistance on the way . " " No trouble about that . The Chunchun garrison commander is on our side . Have we been able to swing the artillery people ? " Colonel Min said , " Five artillery battalions altogether . " I said , " Three from the 22nd Division and two from the 17th Division . " " That 's near Panmunjom , is n't it . The Americans are n't going to like it , " said the general . " Ca n't be helped , " said Colonel Min . " What about the Presidential Brigade ? Any luck ? " " We can count on its armored units . They are solidly behind us . " Good ! I know the commander personally . " " He was one of my students at my university , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , so much the better , " said the general . " How 's ColonelSon doing ? " Colonel Son , our man , was General Mah 's deputy . " Excellent , General . He 's keeping an eye on General Mah . " " Has that son of a bitch made any move yet ? " " Nothing significant so far . We are watching him closely , " I said . General Yoon turned to Colonel Min . " We 've got to get rid of him . " " How ? " I said . " Assassinate him . " Colonel Min did not stir . " Just give me the word , and I will do it myself , " said General Yoon . " He is a vicious , ruthless man and he can ruin us all unless we eliminate him soon . " I ventured timidly , " Do n't you think there will be a proper time for that ? " The general blew up . " A proper time ! What the hell are you talking about ! A proper time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out what 's going on . " My voice rose . " Assassinating him now is n't going to solve anything . As far as I am concerned , murdering him in cold blood or , for that matter , killing anyone in cold blood merely for the sake of ensuring our own safety will simply stain our cause with blood from the start . We will be resorting to the same methods General Mah has been using to eliminate his opponents and that will ultimatelysabotage our own motivation and our own cause , which is to free the nation from the terrors and tyrannies of injustice with which evil men like General Mah have enslaved our people . We ca n't afford to descend to his level  --  no matter for what reason . " " You did n't know that General Mah tortured General Yoon 's father-in-law to death , did you ? " said Colonel- Min to me . " GeneralYoon 's father-in-law was one of the most respected journalists who was brave enough to criticize Mah in public . It happened while you were in Europe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . There 's nothing I can do about that , " said General Yoon . " But you know , surely you must knowP54as well as the whole country does , that that bastard has taken as hostages nearly all of those he considers potential threats to him . One of my maternal uncles , the only brother of my mother 's who is in the south , is in his jail on some trumped-up charge of being a North Korean agent . Even General Ham is no exception . Not that anyone is in jail , but Mah has had General Ham 's son , a second lieutenantin the Engineer Corps , assigned to his headquarters , just to have him around as a hostage . " " I know all that , General , " I said . " Well , then , do n't you see what can happen once the son of a bitch uncovers our plans ? He wo n't even have to roll out his troops . All he has to do is round up the hostages whom he already has in Seoul and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do what he tells us or else . " " Major Lee is aware of that , I am sure , " said Colonel Min .. " Yes , " I said . " Well , then , let 's do something , " said the general . " I have a plan , " said Colonel Min to both of us . " But I think it is a little premature to discuss it now . I will let you know about it when the time comes . So , will you both agree to leave the matter to me for the time being ? " " All right , " said the general . " Whatever you say . I am aware that you have to take other things into consideration , such as publicand foreign opinion and so on . But from my vantage point up here in the mountains , well , you understand my feelings . " Colonel Min nodded . He turned to me . " Well ? " " All right . I give you my word that I 'll abide by the decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough , " said General Yoon with a grin . " I wo n't be able to be with you much of the time but if and when the question of Mah comes up , you have my proxy vote for assassinating him in advance of our coup . " " Very well , " said Colonel Min . " Let 's get down to the more immediatebusiness . Shall we go ? "  |p55We  climbed into General Yoon 's jeep and drove in the wavering fog on the muddy trail that led us to the firing range on a small hill behind the Division headquarters complex . The moment we drove around the last bend on the trail , we heard a burst of submachinegunfire . " What in the hell ! " said the general . The jeep roared up the last stretch of the trail and onto the firing range . The general stopped the jeep and cut the engine . Another jeep , with its engine going , was ahead of us , its headlights illuminating the targets  --  bottles and beer cans lined up on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us , General Ham , in T-shirt , fatigue trousers , and rubber shower clogs , was reloading his submachine gun . General Yoon . switched off the headlights of our jeep . We remained in our seats . A young officer strode over to us . It was Captain Kang , General Ham 's aidede-camp . He saluted us . Colonel Min shook hands with him . The young captain let out a sigh . " Sir , I 've just about had it , " he said to Colonel Min . " You are n't the only one , " said General Yoon . " I understand , Captain , " said Colonel Min . " Patience . It wo n't be long now . How drunk is he ? " " Pretty bad , sir , as usual . Be careful , Colonel . " We got out of the jeep . " Please , be careful , Colonel , " whispered the captain . Colonel Min nodded . We walked over to General Ham . We gave him a salute . He did not turn around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , eh ? " he said . His high-pitched voice was unmistakably angry . " Where are the others ? " Colonel Min did not reply . General Yoon said , " What the hell do you want to see them for ? You can say anything you want to us . " " You keep out of it , " General Ham said , swiveling around . He raised his submachine gun in one hand and pointed it at Colonel Min . " I am speaking to your boss here ! " Captain Kang stepped up and stood behind General Ham.  | " Well , where are the others , Colonel ? " " Considering the time of the day , " said Colonel Min quietly , " I would assume that they are all sound asleep . " Brandishing the submachine gun , General Ham laughed out . " Ha , ha , ha , that 's a good one . I hope they have peaceful dreams , all of them . " His tone changed . " What are you trying to do to me ! Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Will you cut that out ! " said General Yoon . " You wanted to see him , so he is here , at this crazy hour . Is n't that enough ? Say your piece and get it over with . I 've got to go to bed , too . " " I told you to stay out of it , " said General Ham . " Cousin ! " General Yoon gave us a despairing look . Colonel Min said , " General Ham , I did n't come all the way out here to quarrel with you . So , please tell us what you have on your mind . " " Are you all ganging up on me ? " " Please , General , " said Colonel Min . " I am afraid you are badly indisposed toward us , and if you wish , General , we will be glad to come back and see you in the morning . " There was a moment of silence . Abruptly , General Ham said , " Well , I want to know what you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir ? " said the Colonel . " You heard me . I want to know what you think of me . " " What do I think of you ? " " That 's right . " Colonel Min glanced at us . " You are a lieutenant general of our Army , sir , and you command one of the most powerful and important field armies we have . " In a quiet voice , Colonel Min continued , " And , as an Army commander , you are responsible for the welfare and interest of nearly two hundred thousand young men of our country in uniform . Shall I go on , sir ? " I saw Captain Kang grin behind General Ham . General Ham did not respond . " Come on , " said General Yoon . " Let 's get out of here . "  |p57Colonel  Min said , " The general has asked me to tell him what I think of him , and I am going to tell him . Well , General Ham , if I may continue , sir , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ablest generals and field commanders we have in our Army , that is , sir , when you choose to be . In combat , you can be a brilliant tactician and I have seen you being one during the war . In short , sir , I think the country can count on you in time of war , on the field of battle . That is , you are a good soldier , sir , someone whom all conscientious professional soldiers can be proud of . " In a surprisingly sober tone of voice , General Ham said , " There  --  you are insulting me again . So , I am nothing but a good professional soldier , eh ? " " I fail to see how that could be construed as an insulting remark , General , " said Colonel Min . " Yes , you are a good professional soldier , sir . And , I should say , the country needs more people like you in uniform . " " So  --  that 's what you are going to do with me ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power , Colonel , that 's what you are going to do with me . Keep me in uniform ? " Colonel Min kept silent . " Is n't that enough ? Would n't you like to stay in uniform ? " said General Yoon . " I did n't ask for your opinion , cousin , " said General Ham . " Now , you listen to me , " General Yoon went on . " Take you and me . What the hell do you think you and I are good for ? Out of uniform , I mean . What do you think you can be ? A prime minister ? A cabinet minister ? Or the president of a bank ? Hell , no ! You and I are going to stay right here in the Army , cousin . As Colonel Min said , you are a good general , rather , knowing you as I do , you can be a good one when you try to be one . You are a commander of an army , and , who knows , maybe someday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " General Ham said , " I take it that you are either trying to insult me further or trying to bribe me . " He stared at Colonel Min . " Isp58that what you all have figured out ? To bribe me with the promise of making me the chief of staff of the Army when you take over the country ? " " You seem to think that we are going to occupy the country as if we were at war with an enemy in a foreign land . No , General , no one is trying to bribe you with anything . I am afraid you have failed to understand my position . " " I am so stupid , Colonel . You 'll have to tell me again just what your position is . " " All right , sir . If our coup is successful and we have a chance to set the country straight , we would like you to continue to serve the country in the best way you can , the way you have served it so far , as one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position will be , no one at this stage is prepared to say . And , in all sincerity , General , we must not think of such a thing . " " We must not think of such a thing , ' " General Ham said . " Well , well , how noble of you  --  when you are dreaming of becoming the President . " " You are drunk ! " shouted General Yoon . " Shut up ! " said General Ham . " Gentlemen , we are not going to accomplish anything this way , " said Colonel Min . " General Ham , if you please , I would be glad to see you in the morning . " " When I am sober ? " " If you like , sir . " " I am sober enough . " " Then behave yourself , " said General Yoon , " cousin . " General Ham , his eyes glaring through his rimless glasses and his face perspiring , hissed at General Yoon . " I could kill you for that impudent remark . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sober enough . Captain ! " Captain Kang stepped up to General Ham . " Captain , go get the carbine in the jeep . " " Sir ? " " I said , go get the goddamned carbine in the jeep 1 "  |p59Ca|ptain  Kang went over to the jeep and returned with a carbine . " Is it loaded ? " General Ham said . " Yes , sir . " " Give it to me . " General Ham turned to Colonel Min . " I am quite sober , Colonel , contrary to my dear cousin 's low opinion of me . And I 'll show you how sober I am . " With a sudden jerk of his head , he flung the carbineto the Colonel . " Now , Colonel , shall we find out who is more sober ? " General Ham clutched the submachine gun in his hands , facing Colonel Min , who stood with the carbine in one hand . General Ham raised the submachine gun , almost pointing it at Colonel Min 's chest . I tried to step forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood motionless . I saw Captain Kang , a few steps behind General Ham , reach for his .45 pistol . For one long moment , no one spoke or moved . The jeep engine , untended to , whined away . For the first time , I became aware of the thin fog all around us . General Ham tapped on the submachine gun . " How about it , Colonel ? " he said . He was sober enough and his voice was quite steady . " Shall we knock off some bottles ? " Colonel Min did not answer . He was holding the carbine in his hands , his head lowered , looking at the carbine . " What 's the matter , Colonel ? Are you afraid I 'll outshoot you ? " " This is ridiculous , " said General Yoon . " I order you to be quiet , " said General Ham . " You are in my territory , cousin , " said General Yoon . " Do n't you forget it . " Colonel Min said , quietly , " Captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came forward and took the carbine from Colonel Min . " Well , what 's the matter , Colonel ? " said General Ham . " General Ham , if you do n't mind , I would like to consider this meeting concluded . "  | " Just a minute , Colonel , " said General Ham . Colonel Min stood facing him . " Yes ? " General Ham grinned . " Would you rather chop those bottles with a sword , maybe , eh ? But , I do n't have any swords handy here ; besides , we do n't fight with swords nowadays , do we ? " " What the hell are you talking about ? " said General Yoon . " Let 's all get out of here and go to bed . You too , cousin ! " General Ham ignored him . " Well , Colonel , I am well aware of your violent temper and your great skill with a sword . Do you still practiceit ? " Colonel Min kept silent . " What is this ? " said General Yoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Min is a great man with a sword . He can cut you in half with a sword before you can blink your eyes , is n't that right , Colonel ? I know all about it . How do you do it ? Like this ? " General Ham , slashing at the foggy night air with one hand , yelled out at the top of his lungs : " Yaaaa ! " It gave me shivers . General Yoon drew himself up to General Ham . " Come on . This is enough . " General Ham pushed him away . " Colonel Min , you did n't know that I knew all about it , did you ? That poor Japanese captain ! Yaaaa ! And there he was , chopped in half . Horrors ! How did you do it ? Anyway , you caused a great deal of trouble for me . You see , Colonel , I was a captain in your regiment and I knew who you were but , of course , you did n't know who I was . Thanks to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mistrust of my Japanese fellow officers and missed my chance for a promotion . You did n't know that , did you ? I was even denied permission to join the search party to track you down . Oh , I would have been glad to track you down . After all , a murder is a murder , whether or not it was committed by a fellow Korean , do n't you agree ? " " What is all this about , General ? " I said . " Are you accusing Colonel Min of having committed a murder ? " " Hacking a man in half . . . I do n't know what else I could call it except a murder . Well , well , that 's all in the sweet past , is n't it , P61Colonel ? And now , irony of ironies , you are in a position to track me down and tell me what to do . How ironical it all turned out to be , eh ? " " Is it true , Colonel ? " I said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Was this Japanese officer  --  was he the one you brought home with you once ? " I said . He looked at me and then at General Yoon . He glared at General Ham ; his face was seething with an almost savage fury . But , in a moment , I sensed his fury withdraw as if into and beneath the dark skin of his face and what I saw after that was nothing but a stony expression that was colder than indifference . He slowly moved up to General Ham . He pushed the submachine gun aside . " General Ham , you are right . Now I am in a position to tell you what to do , and I am going to tell you what to do . I am going to tell you , GeneralHam , that , from now on , you must stop dreaming a foolish dream , that you must stop overestimating yourself , that you must not interfere with our plans and work , and that you must abide by your original pledge to keep yourself neutral . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ham , " Colonel Min 's words are my words , too . " General Ham turned to me . " And you  --  are they yours , too ? " I nodded . " So , I was right after all , " said General Ham . " You are all gangingup on me . Very well . Captain Kang ! Get ready . We are going back to the headquarters . " Captain Kang looked at Colonel Min . " So  --  you are telling me what to do from now on , " said General Ham to Colonel Min . " Yes . " " We shall see , we shall see , " he said . He handed the submachine gun to Captain Kang . " Well , let me tell you something before I go . Colonel Min , make no mistake about it . If I wanted to , I have all the power I need to crush you . " Colonel Min went closer to him . In a calm whisper , he said toP62the general , " General Ham , we have all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Please , make no mistake about it , General . " " Yes , General Ham , " I said . " We have all the power we need to resist you ! " General Ham stared at us . " Captain Kang ! Bring the jeep around . We are going ! " Captain Kang did not move . " Captain ! " General Yoon looked at Colonel Min , who nodded to him . General Yoon said to General Ham , " Well , cousin , it looks as though you are going to be my guest for a few days . " In an oddly quiet voice , General Ham said , " Are you putting me under arrest ? " " I am merely stretching my hospitality , cousin . " Suddenly , General Ham laughed aloud . " I knew you were all stupidbut I never realized you could be this stupid . Make no mistake about it , Colonel Min . I have all the power to crush you , every one of you , no matter where I am . " I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  bring the jeep around ! " Captain Kang , the submachine gun in his hand , did not stir . Colonel Min said , " General Ham , if you are referring to your secretcommunication with General Mah and to your planned rendezvous with him at ten o'clock this evening , I suggest that you forget about keeping the appointment . " General Yoon nearly leaped at General Ham . " Why , you sneaky ... " Colonel Min restrained General Yoon . " No need to discuss the matter with him now . " He turned to me and then to General Yoon . " I was hoping that , perhaps , some of us would accompany General Ham to his rendezvous with General Mah . That was the plan I referred to earlier . But , I am afraid the plan will have to be modified . General Ham , we will have to keep the appointment without you . I hope you do n't mind . We will give him your regards . "  |p63General  Ham stood motionless . General Yoon said , " Captain Kang ! " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from us into the fog beyond the jeep . We heard him call out into the darkness . " Captain Lee ! Captain Lee ! Bring the men up ! " In a minute , out of the fog came a squad of armed soldiers into our view . Quietly they came and stood by the jeep . Captain Kang saluted General Ham . " Are you ready , sir ? " For a second , I could not help feeling an uncontrollable shock . General Ham said to Colonel Min , " Are you going to murder me , too ? " In panic , I stepped up to Colonel Min , when he said quietly to General Ham , " No , General , we simply wish you to have a quiet rest here for a few days . " " We shall see who wins , Colonel , " said General Ham . " I have the power to destroy you , all of you ! " Colonel Min said , turning away , " We have the power to resist you , General , as you see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murderer ! " Colonel Min swung around violently , facing the general , his face distorted and twitching with anger as if he were about to shriek out , but he did not speak . In a second , he composed himself , his face betrayingnot a trace of emotion , and he walked slowly toward General Yoon 's jeep , alone . I did not know what to think . I did not know what to say . It was only when the three of us  --  General Yoon , Colonel Min , and myself  --  came down from the firing range that I realized that I had not spoken more than a sentence or two chagrin , into a state of ludicrous panic . The fog was thicker and the air more oppressive down at the deadly quiet headquarters than it was up on the hill . I suddenly became aware of the fatigue from the long drive from Seoul through rain and fog ; the sense ofp64relief at the outcome of our confrontation ( for , it was settled one way or the other without , thank heavens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , and I would have been glad to plunk myself down on any cot , then and there , and sink into an undisturbed , long sleep , without reflecting on that which had come to pass and without worrying about that which was to come . But there was no peace in my mind . General Yoon drove us to where we had left our jeep . Until then , neither of us had spoken . When we got out of the general 's jeep , Colonel Min held the general 's arm . " I am sorry we had to do this , " said Colonel Min to General Yoon . " He is your cousin , after all . " " It was about time , " said the general . " He has given me nothing but headaches . " " You 'll make sure there wo n't be any security leak , " said the Colonel . " Do n't worry about a thing at this end . Will you take care of his headquarters ? " " Of course . We will get in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get back to the Corps . Would you call our headquartersand speak with Colonel Park ? Where will you keep him ? " " There 's a little cabin up in the mountains about two miles from here . Remember that one ? Actually , it is a sort of hunting lodge he has used before to entertain American advisers . Well , he can now entertain himself for a few days . Speaking of American advisers , what do we do with his advisers at his headquarters ? " " I will have Colonel McKay take care of that . " " You trust him ? " " Yes . " " What do we do after that ? " " With General Ham ? " " Yes . " " Release him after our coup is well under way . I am sure he will come to his senses by then . " " There is one virtue in him . He knows when he is beaten . "  | " In spite of what happened , we do want him to be on our side . Besides , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the front , for a while at least . " " All right , then , " said the general . " I 'll give the instructions to Captain Kang and Captain Lee . Now , what about his rendezvous with General Mah ? " " To tell you the truth , I did n't know about it until he came out here . He was supposed to stop at the Corps . To see me , that is . That was the plan . He did n't stop and flew on to here . I thought there had to be some change in his plans . I was going to check with our people at his headquarters , but before I had a chance to do so , I had a call from his Intelligence chief , Colonel Bang . You know him , do n't you ? " General Yoon nodded . " Colonel Bang called me on the hot line and told me that he had been instructed by General Ham to make an arrangement for a secretmeeting . " " Where ? " " Outside Seoul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The rendezvous will take place about a mile north of the vil-lage . " " Did he tell General Mah why he wanted to meet him ? " " Nothing specific . He was playing a game , I am afraid . While Colonel Bang was on the line , a direct line , with General Mah at his house , General Ham came in and took it over from him . Colonel Bang told me that General Ham made it all sound rather mysterious . Something very urgent and important and so on , and that he wanted General Mah to keep it absolutely confidential . After I talked with Colonel Bang , I had Colonel Kim , our Intelligence chief , double-check it with Colonel Son in Seoul , and it was confirmed . General Mah has broken the confidence and informed Colonel Son about it . A piece of good luck for us . Colonel Son is making the arrangementfor General Mah . " " Well , well , it 's all working out fine ! " said General Yoon . " What do you have in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have to keep the appointment , do n't you think ? " General Yoon grinned . " Naturally ! We will have to show up at the rendezvous . " " Then what ? " I said . They both turned and looked at me as though they were surprised to see me there with them . Colonel Min said quietly , " I do n't know . I have n't thought about it that far ahead . " General Yoon said , " Bump him off . What else ? " I ventured , " I suggest we put the question to the Command Group . " Colonel Min nodded . " Of course . " General Yoon said , " Well , we know what the Group will decide to do , do n't we ? How about sending me down there ? I would like to volunteer . After all , I am General Ham 's cousin . If he ca n't keep the appointment , maybe his cousin can , ha , ha , ha ! " " I think it is not a matter to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , General . I pledged myself to the decision of the Command Group and I shall do ... " General Yoon cut me short . " Do what ? " " Do whatever I can to settle this problem without resorting to bloodshed . " The general snorted . " What the hell do you expect ? A lily-white revolution ? Major , let me tell you something . . . " Colonel Min interrupted . " That 's enough . " " All right , all right , " said the general . " Let me know how the Group decides on it . You know where I stand . " I felt I had to speak up . " I do not expect our coup to be a lilywhiterevolution , as you put it , General , but I do not want it to be an act of bloodstained vengeance . " General Yoon cried out , " Who is talking about bloodstained vengeance ! " " We are trying to create an opportunity for the country and the people to correct the past wrongs but not an opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "  | " Oh , you and your fancy words , Major ! " said the general . " You speak as though our coup were already successful and we had the upper hand . It is not revenge or bloody vengeance I am seeking , Major . I am talking about self-defense . Our self-defense ! The success of our coup depends entirely on whether General Mah is going to strike us first or whether we are going to strike him first . That 's how I see the whole situation from where I am . Do n't you agree , Colonel Min ? " Colonel Min nodded . " There is no doubt about that . " " Then you have made up your mind to kill him , " I said . Colonel Min said , " I did not say that . " " Just why are you so upset about killing him ? " said the general to me . " He will have to die sooner or later . " " Major Lee wants a court-martial for him , " said the Colonel . General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the same way ; that is , Major , if we are lucky enough to live through this . Well , we want the same thing , do n't we , Major ? So , then , what 's the dif-ference ? " " I want to prevent our coup from being stained with unnecessary and wanton bloodshed , General . I want our coup to be an honorable one . " " And I want our coup to succeed , Major . It has to succeed first to find out if it was an honorable coup or not . I know , I know ! I know what you think I am thinking . Means justify an end . Well , Major , I am not thinking about anything profound . I am thinking of survival , Major . My survival and yours , too . All of us . If we do n't strike Mah now , he is going to strike us down . It is as simple as that . If you do n't believe in what I am sure you think is my crude , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to live through this world of men in some other way . I want to do some good things , Major , but if some bad man tries to chop my head off before I have a chance ... " " So you chop his head off first , General . We shall all end up becomingbeasts . " " Hell ! It is not a question of our becoming beasts . We are al/ready beasts , do n't you know ? Only there are reasonably decent beasts and then there are evil beasts . " Abruptly , Colonel Min strode away from us . He flung himself into our jeep in the driver 's seat and gripped the wheel . " Get in , " he said . I did not stir . I thought his voice sounded harsh as though he were barking out a command . I felt bitter . I looked at General Yoon . He was shaking his head . He nodded to me , whispering , " Go on now ! " In that moment , I did not know what was happening . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then did I realize that his voice was not commanding me at all , but pleading that I speak no more . General Yoon tapped me on the shoulder . " We 've got big mouths , you and I. Get going now . I 'll see you around . " Suddenly , I felt choked by the dank , heavy , foggy darkness of the night that silently swallowed us . I gave a hasty salute to the general and crawled into the jeep . I felt very small.  |p69Colonel  Min drove slowly out of the division headquarters . We did not speak for a long while . A ghostly veil of gray fog drifted in and out along the winding road , swaying up and down . A mile or so from the entrance to the division headquarters , we left the muddy road and drove onto the main route of supply . The sky was dark and the air chilly . I could not tell the time ; the phosphorescent dial of my wristwatch dimly showed that the watch had stopped running somewherearound one o'clock . I glanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his mouth . " Can you tell me the time ? " I said . He did not look at me . " I do n't have my watch with me , " he said . " Mine stopped , " I said . " It must be nearly two o'clock . " " Must be , " he said . " Tired ? " I sat up on the seat . " No . " " I am , " he said . " You have lots on your mind . " For the first time since we had left General Yoon 's division , he looked at me . " I suppose I do , " he said . " Do n't you ? " " Yes . "   " Are you still thinking about General Mah ? " " No , " I confessed . He looked at me again . I said , " I have been thinking about what General Yoon said . " " About what ? " " That we are already beasts . Only there are reasonably decent beasts and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? " " What ? " " That you are a beast ? " he said quietly . " That we are all beasts ? " " Why should it bother me ? I do n't believe it . I refuse to think that way . " " Ah , but it would bother you , then , if you believed that we are all already beasts , is that it ? " " Even so , why should it bother me ? If human nature is basically evil beyond redemption , then there is n't much hope for mankind , and there would n't be any sense in any of us trying to do good , would there ? " " That is quite silly and you know it . Besides , it is an easy way out , do n't you think ? " " An easy way out of what ? " " Out of trying to do something good , trying to be a decent human being . " " Trying to be a decent beast ? " My voice sounded bitter . " Perhaps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of yourself , then ? That you are a decent beast and those you destroy are evil beasts beyond redemption ? " He did not reply . " Beasts devouring beasts . It 's a pretty picture of humanity . " With a voice thoroughly devoid of any emotion , he said quite simply , " Yes , is n't it ? " Before I had a chance to refute his outrageous words , he assaultedme with : " There is more evil in the world , do n't you know ? And  --  evil must be destroyed . "  |p71I  had had enough . The day had been a little too much to take . I shot back at him , " Who is going to destroy the evil ? Chaplain Koh insists that the evil in the world can not be cured by human effort alone . " He said , " And you insist that the evil in the world can be cured by human effort ? " " Yes ! " " I agree . " " What ? " " I said I agreed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it is the good in man that will ultimately destroy the evil in the world . " " No . " " Then what ? " " Perhaps , the evil in man can be destroyed only by the evil in man . Who knows ? " " Well ! There wo n't be anything left to salvage after that ! " I had not suspected that my words would agitate him or infuriate him so much . He jammed on the brakes , grinding the gears . The jeep screeched to a wild stop , jerking and bouncing . He swung it around and whipped it roaring back toward the division . Hanging onto my seat , I shouted , " What are you doing ! " His voice snapped , " We 'll take a shortcut ! " I stared at him in the dark . He slowed the jeep down . " Do you mind ? " " Go ahead . " He drove back about half a mile or so and stopped the jeep where , on the right side of the road , a narrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be nowhere . Someone had put up a road sign once , but the letters on the makeshift sign were blurred and unintelligible . Colonel Min said , " This is it . " " Well , if you say so . I am not familiar with this region . " He let the engine idle and lit his pipe . " I am . I know this area insideand out , every inch of it . You were on the western front during the war , were n't you ? "  | " Yes . " " I passed through here when we began our counteroffensive and pushed the Communists back into North Korea . I had a battalion . " " Rangers ? " " No . Before that . Infantry . Right here . " He drove onto the road . The slushy mud on this road was thicker than it was on the main road . The jeep bounced and skidded on . " A horrible road . Do you think we can make it through ? " " We 'll see , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth under its wheels . The hopping and bouncing headlights frantically thrust at the vaporywall of fog wavering above the slimy dirt . It was a rough , windingroad that had not been much used by many . I could not see too far ahead , and had I been at the wheel I would have missed nearly all the sharp curves and bends which seemed to appear suddenly and from nowhere . Colonel Min did not miss any . It was as though he had been traveling on that road for years , back and forth , memorizingevery single bump , dent , pothole , curve , and bend . He knew the road . In the dim glow of his pipe , I thought that I saw his taut , lean face break into a sardonic smile whenever he felt my tense reaction to a sudden , menacing curve , which he maneuvered with a deadly calmness . He muttered something . " What ? " " We 'll make it through , " he said . " Better hold on . " Until then , I had not fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now became noticeably sharp and quick . Colonel Min shifted the jeep into a lower gear . The jeep slowed down with a groan and shudder . The fog became thicker and heavier . In a few minutes , the road leveled off and ran straight ahead . Colonel Min stopped the jeep and cut the engine . Silence rushed in . and engulfed us . " Where are we ? " I said . " We are at the bottom of a valley . The road cuts straightp73through it . At the other end of the valley , it goes uphill and joins the main route about two miles from our headquarters . Here . " He switched the headlights off . " Now you can see it better . Look up . " I could not make out much of the surroundings . " Once your eyes get used to the darkness , you can see ... " " Yes . " I had not felt that the mountains were so close by . The bottom of the valley was walled in everywhere by darkly looming , towering precipices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a valley . My eyes traced the silhouette of the crest of the mountain on my right , following its jagged , undulating course . Clouds of fog swayed up and down . Somewhere I heard a stream gurgling . Suddenly , I felt as though we were completely sealed in by the dark mountains which might come crashing down on us any moment . I thought I heard a rock sliding down . " Actually , these mountains are not that high . Steep and rocky but not really high , " he said . " Watch this . " He reached into the back seat and brought out a revolver . Before I could say a word , he fired the gun into the dank air . The flash blinded me a moment , then I heard the shot echoing off into the sky , against the mountains which reverberated the sound one after another in an unending wave of shuddering roars . I felt as though thousands of beasts , their slumbers suddenly disturbed , crouching in fury somewhere in the deep , dark caves of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Min put the revolver away into the back seat and sat straight up in his seat . Then , taking me by surprise , he turned on the ignition , and the engine came to life , shuddering , trembling , and whining . A moment of shivery illusion overwhelmed me ; the sudden , frantic roar of the jeep and the sullen , growling , angryechoes of the gunshot seemed to clash against each other in the ghostly , foggy , night air , swirling in the vortexes of sounds and furries ; and the aroused mountains , black and brooding , massive and menacing , now taking part in the eerie slaughter of sounds , seemed to come closing in on us slowly and inexorably , nearer and nearerP74from all sides , threatening to squeeze and crush us  --  Colonel Min switched the headlights on  --  the mountains rushed toward us from the right and from the left like a gigantic vise . . . Colonel Min drove ahead , stopped , and drove on a little farther , stopped again ; then , he began rocking the jeep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swiveling , as it were , the jeep around . And only then it occurred to me that he was trying to find something out there in the dark , using the jeep 's headlights as a searchlight . " There ! " he whispered . " There they are ! Look ! " I squinted hard into the misty darkness . " What ? Where ? " " There ! There ! " The stem of his pipe jabbed at the dark air . Then I saw them , one , two , three , four , five .. mound aftermound of black earth . Colonel Min whispered . " Graves . Mass graves . " " Graves ? " " Each one of them must have fifteen , twenty corpses rotted inside . More of them at the other end of the valley , with more skeletonsinside . " Patches of gray fog wafted in over the mounds . I turned to him . " Your men , " I said . " Are they your men 's ? " He shook his head . " No . Communists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? " I said . " Were you here when . . . " " My men were up there , " he said , looking up at the dark precipices . His hand swept the air . " I had them positioned up there , all around , all over . I was there . " He pointed at an invisible crest of a mountain to our right . " Yes . I had my command post up there . From there , I had the full view of the valley , every inch of it , every corner of it . We had the whole valley sealed off . We had them trapped in here . " " The Communists ? " " And their political prisoners . None escaped . They were all massacred . We slaughtered them all . None of them got out of here alive . We killed them all . "  | " You killed them all . " I realized I was whispering . " But  --  but why ? " He did not reply . He turned off the engine and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the mounds , the mass graves , faded into the foggy air ; then , as my vision became accustomed to the darkness all around us , I could feel their blurred , shadowypresence . I looked up toward the sky and saw that the black rain cloud had been shredded into hundreds of fluffy patches now aimlessly drifting amid the star-studded sky . Colonel Min 's hushed voice startled me . " What ? " " The Japanese captain , " he said . " Yes , I killed him , too . " It was like a coup de main ; since we had left General Yoon 's headquarters , I had been searching for an opening in the armor of his silence , as it were , through which I could assault him with questionson General Ham 's accusation . Thoroughly taken by surprise , I blurted out , " Did he have to die ? This  --  this Japanese officer ? " He said quickly , " Did he have to die ? Did he have to die ? I do n't know . How would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Yes , I killed him ! Did he have to die ? No , that I do n't know . I would never know . I was not a judge . I was only an executioner , do n't you know ? " His shadowy face turned to me and his voice slashed at me with a ferocious savageness . " I was only his executioner , do n't you know ? I was never his judge ! Do you understand that ? I never judged him . I never had a moment to judge him . I simply executed him . Did I have time to evaluate him , cross-examine him , judge him , and find him guilty of being an evil man who deserved to be executed ? No , no , Major Lee . The evil in him manifested itself and it had to be destroyed . " " It had to be destroyed , you say , " I said . " There  --  you did judge him ! " " Ah , you do not understand , Major . I did not set myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good and the pure , handing down a fair , impartial , just verdict on the symbol of the evil and the corrupt inP76man . No , no ! It was a battle between the evils , do n't you know ! His evil was executed by my evil . As you said , beasts devouring beasts ! " He froze himself into a stony silence . I dared not disturb him . And he began , slowly , quietly , as if thawing himself out of the mass of ice he had just been . " You asked me if this Japanese captain was the Japanese officer I had brought with me to my hometown . I suppose Lieutenant Cho has told you about that . No , that was First Lieutenant Nomura . Nomura Tadashi . He was one of my best friends . And Lieutenant Cho 's father 's , too . We all went to a university together in Tokyo in nineteen-forty-one . And we roomed together , too , in downtown Tokyo . We had a small apartment , Lieutenant Cho 's father and I , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends . Nomura was the only son of an impoverished Japanese noble family . His father had a title , baronet , I think . Nomura never wanted to talk about that and about his family . At first , we were a little wary of him , I am afraid . In those days , Japanese and Koreans seldom mixed . The first year there in the apartment , we were polite to each other , met occasionally to exchange our notebooks or to go over our examinations . That was all . But three years of living together under the same roof , going to the same classes , reading the same books , being interested in the same subjects , well , all that enabled us to forget that he was Japaneseand we were Koreans and whatever social and political implicationsour relationships entailed . We became fast friends . By the third year , we practically lived together , sharing meals , books , and nearly everything else . And only then did he reveal to us that he thought Japan would be defeated in the war , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the sufferings of Koreans inflictedon them by the Japanese , that he hoped the end of the war would bring a long-hoped-for liberation of the Korean people . He believed that the system of emperors would come to an end and the defeat of Japan would usher in an entirely new , purified society toP77his country . He regarded the war as an act of purgation for Japanesepeople , the war they brought on themselves , a result of their hubris , their hamartia . A period of great atonement would follow the end of the war . He never lived to see that day . If he had , perhaps he would have been disappointed and disillusioned . He was a poet , a romanticist , a dreamy idealist who became a passionate Marxist in his second year at the university . Was I ever a Marxist ? No  --  even in those days , I never seemed to have had what it takes to be an idealist . Lieutenant Cho 's father was a Marxist , once , that is , until the Communists took over North Korea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Lieutenant Cho told me about it . " " Then you know . Yes , only to die at the hands of **25;9879;TOOLONG . Yes , he was an idealist , too , just like Nomura . In fact , it now seems that they had more in common than I with eitherof them . Well , at the end of our third year at the university , Nomura had to go into the army . He had to volunteer , do you understand ? " " Yes . Then our turns came , too . " He nodded . " Yes . So  --  Nomura became a second lieutenant in the glorious , sacred army of the Sun-God , and he was sent to Manchuria . We gave him a farewell party just before he went to see his parents in Kyoto for the last time . We drank , we wept , and we promised to each other that someday , someday when the whole world recovered from its madness , perhaps we would meet again somewhere and help each other in building a new world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up whatever was left from the ashes of the war . Perhaps I was an idealist , too , who knows ? So he went off to a war that he hoped would defeat his country , yes , defeat his country for the sake of her ultimate salvation . And then , we , too , left the university and Japan and returned to Korea . " " Only to be drafted by the Japanese into their army , like Nomura . " " Yes . I tried to escape from them . Heaven knows I tried . But , in the end , I could not get away from them , and I decided that the bestP78way I could escape from them was to join them . You see , I wanted to go to China , hoping that perhaps , once I was in China , I could run away from them and join up with the Koreans in exile who had combat units fighting alongside the Chinese against Japan . " " Some of them were with the Nationalist and some with the ChineseCommunists . Which ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days , it did n't matter which side , did it ? I managed to sneak myself out of Korea and go to Manchuria , near Mukden . Nomura was stationed there , you see . I knew that . He was a first lieutenant then , assigned to a makeshift officers training center set up by the Kanto Army . I hoped that he would and could help me to smuggle myself into China . It did n't turn out to be that way . " " He refused to help you ? " " No , no , that 's not what I meant . I got in touch with him and told him my situation and my hopes and plans . Well , to make a long story short , he , in the end , convinced me that the best way , the best plan for both of us , was for me to become a Japanese officer . How ? He had a plan . It so happened that the commandant of the training center was a young lieutenant colonel whose father was a vassal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nomura 's father had helped him through school before the Nomura family 's fortune declined . This colonel was quite loyal to Nomura 's father and to the Nomura family , and that was why Nomura was assigned to his training center as a favor . He had vowed to look after Nomura , you see . Nomura took me to see him . We planned this together , of course . I was to volunteer for the Army . I was to present myself and convince him I was a Korean loyal to the Japanese empire and its cause . And , naturally , being Nomura 's friend did n't hurt our plan . Nomura asked him to make an extraordinary exception and take me into the training center as an officer candidate . Without checking me out with the Japanese authority in my hometown , or notifying them of my volunteering , said Nomura , because , as the colonel surely understands , there is a strong anti-Japanese sentimentamong Koreans and if the fact of my having volunteered forP79the Japanese Army were to be publicly known in my hometown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family , no one could imagine what sort of humiliation and abuse my family might becomesubjected to , although my family would be quite proud of my being in the emperor 's army as an officer , and so on . The colonel never doubted Nomura 's words . Besides , I think he was actually glad to take me in , if not as a great favor for Nomura , then just to have another potential officer to carry on the war . In any case , I becamean officer in a month and a half . " " They were in a hurry to ship you out . I had n't realized their training period was so short . Of course , as you know , I became an officer , formally , that is , in about three months . " " I became one in two months in this Army . Anyway , when I was duly commissioned , I stayed at the center for a while as an assistant of a sort to Nomura , another favor from the commandant . Then , finally , Nomura @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a newly formed task force , and I volunteered to go along with him . The commandant made me a platoon leader under Nomura , an unheard-of thing for a Korean to take charge of a Japanese platoon , and we were to proceed to somewhere along the Mongolian border to guard against the Soviets and also to fight the Chinese Communists ' Eighth Route Army . We had a week of leave before our departureand it was then that Nomura really took me into his confidenceand revealed his plans to me . He wanted to escape . He wanted to desert , you see , to cross the Mongolian border into Russia and surrender himself and ask for political asylum in the Soviet Union . He wanted me to go with him . I was n't about to give myself up to the Russians . I wanted to join up with the Korean exile groups . Of course , I could n't quite convince him to surrender himself to the Korean units . In any case , we were of one mind on one thing , that we would escape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stroke of fortune , you might say , that we were to be stationed so close to the Mongolian border . And then we decided to visit Lieutenant Cho 's father . Mind you , it was not for any sentimental reason that we de/cided to take a chance and go to my hometown to see him . Not to see my family , either . I had already known that both my parents had died . We wanted to see Cho because , you see , he was an undergroundagent for the Korean exile group with the Chinese CommunistEighth Route Army . He was the only one I knew who was in constant contact with the exile group , who could help me to get in touch with the group and to be trusted once I reached them . So , Nomura volunteered to come along with me to my hometown , as an added protection for me , just in case , although my being a Japanese officer would undoubtedly prevent any kind of harassment from the local Japanese police . Besides , he wanted to see Cho @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , had to join me and give himself up to the Chinese Communists . Our plan was to have Cho send word to his contacts so that if and when I , or both I and Nomura , made it to the Chinese side , they would have had some sort of advance information on me or on us , however it was going to turn out . " " So  --  you went back to your hometown , " I said , " and the whole town adored you . " " Yes . They did . They did n't care about the fact that I was a Japanese officer . The only thing they cared for was that I was still alive . I think many of them instinctively knew what I was really up to , although no one dared mention it . Yes , they were good to me . " I ventured , " Was it because . . . ? Could it have been because of this thing about the Japanese detective ? I mean , the Korean detectiveworking for the Japanese police ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I stared at his dark face . " What Japanese detective ? " " Never mind , " I said . " I did n't mean to interrupt you . I understandLieutenant Cho 's father was sick . Tuberculosis ? " " Yes , he had tuberculosis . He was a brave , kind man . He gave us the names of some people in Manchuria , near the border , who might be able to help us . Nomura and I stayed in town for a few days , I paid my last respects to my parents ' graves , then we came back toP81Manchuria just in time for our departure to the Mongolian border . We arrived at our post sometime in the latter part of May . That was in nineteen-forty-five , and our first opportunity came in the second week of June . " " And you made it . " " No . We did n't make it . As I said , Nomura had wanted to go over to the Russian side , but he had to change his mind about it and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in touch with a Chineseagent Lieutenant Cho 's father had suggested that we see . This Chinese was an agent of the Chinese Communist Eighth Route Army , a Communist , that is . When Nomura told him of his intention of deserting to the Soviets , he advised Nomura against doing it . What he said to Nomura had a great emotional impact on him , I am afraid . The Chinese agent said that the Soviets were , at that time , not about to do anything to impair their relations with the Japanese . There had been cases of Japanese defectors crossing the border into the Soviet side and the Russians had simply arrested them and handed them back to the Japanese military authority . But I am a Marxist , said Nomura . The Chinese just snorted at him . It did n't make any difference to the Russians , he said . The Russianswould surely invade Manchuria as soon as they could afford the effort , but , until then , such an act on their part as handing Japanesedefectors back across the border was part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convinced and decided to come over with me . As I said , we never made it . We almost made it through , but we were caught by the Japanese at the top of a mountain , which at the time more or less separated the **25;9906;TOOLONG and the Communist-controlled region . There had been a stalemate of a sort between them , and if we had made it over that mountain , we would have been in the Chinese sector . As it turned out , it was Nomura 's orderly who had suspected us and when we rode out of the post that afternoon  --  yes , we went on horses  --  when we did n't come back to the post by the time we had said we would be back , the orderly reported to the battalion corn/mander . We had planned it carefully , but we did n't know that a battalion adjacent to ours had just been moved out that afternoon . We did n't have that information , that the battalion was going to try to take the mountain and set up an artillery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battalion on the move was alerted . We did n't have a chance . Our battalion sent a captain out to Nomura 's company to take over , and this captain , who had been a career noncommissionedofficer , about thirty-five years old , joined the search with a platoon from Nomura 's old company . Two days later , we were caught by the patrol from the other battalion ; that was in the early afternoon , and by nightfall we were handed over to this captainwho was given the job of escorting us back to our battalion , and then to the division . Only  --  he had no intention of taking us back all the way to the division . He meant to kill us on the way . " We started around six o'clock in the evening , this captain with his platoon of men from Nomura 's old company , some from my own platoon , too , all riding on horses . We came down the mountain and went about four miles , heading for the small village where we were supposed to spend the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , there would be Chinese guerrillas swarming all over . And I am sure we had been spotted by the guerrillas already and I am equally sure that they had followed us , too . About a mile or so from the village , the captain stopped us . We dismounted . The captaincalled the sergeant in charge of the platoon , the same sergeant who had been Nomura 's sergeant major . The captain ordered him to pick a squad of men out of the platoon and have the rest of the men proceed to the village . A squad stayed with us and the rest of them left . I think I knew then what the captain was up to . He was going to kill us . I am sure Nomura sensed that and the sergeant , too , because he began telling the captain that it was dangerous to break up the platoon there , at that time of the night , when the guerrillas might appear any moment , and so on . The captain would n't listen to that . Although it was in June @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moon , I remember , and I remember , too , that there was the dark , P83massive , silent mountain behind us and the endless , flat , great plains of Manchuria spread before us for miles and miles . And there we were , in the middle of nowhere , you might say , and the captain was getting ready for our execution . At first , I thought he was goingto have us shot by the squad , a makeshift firing squad . But he had a more devilish plan in his mind . " " He was going to kill you himself ? " " No . He was going to have us kill each other . Not exactly , but it would have come out that way . He had me untied . We had been bound with ropes , you see , and now he commanded the sergeant to untie me . Nomura was still bound . The captain  --  I never knew his name  --  he had the squad surround us in a circle , in the middle of which he had Nomura kneel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , and then he worked himself up into a savage tirade against Nomura . The point of his rage was that Nomura was a disgrace to the Imperial Army , to the Holy Emperor , indeed , to the Sun-God himself . He could understand why I would want to desert ; a cheap , despicable Korean who could never be trusted . Yes , he could understand a Korean wanting to escape ; he had never trusted , and he would never trust , Koreans even when they were in the uniform of the Imperial Army . But , Nomura , the son of a noble family , a volunteer , an officer , an officer of the invincible Kanto Army  --  that was a different story . In short , my act was a crime ; I was like a thief or an embezzler , a small-time crook , you might say . I simply committed a petty crime , from his point of view . But , Nomura 's act was treason ; Nomura committed a sin . I was a mere criminal whereas Nomura was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shameful punishment he could think of for Nomura was that he die at my hand . " " You  --  you kill Nomura ! " " Yes , I was to kill Nomura . Nomura was to die at the hand of a subhuman criminal , me . " " He would n't have had the authority to execute you and Nomura . "   " Ah , did it matter ? " " And what about you ? Were you to be shot ? Or kill yourself ? " " Nothing of the sort . He would let me go when I killed Nomura . Yes , he would let me go . But , of course , the moment I took a step , he would have shot me . He wanted me to execute Nomura , in any case . He drew his sword . Nomura was blindfolded . He was on his knees . He was delirious , but he knew what was about to happen to him . He could n't speak coherently but he was mumbling on , beggingme to kill him . He would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neck at the division and have everyone see him die . First he begged the captain to let him commit hara-kiri . You are n't good enough to be a samurai , ' sneered the captain . The soldiers were stone silent , as if mesmerized . The sergeant was shaking ; I could feel his hand on my arm and , indeed , his whole body trembling . Nomura was hissing , Min , Min ! ' He was calling me by my Korean name , you see . Min , Min , ' he was saying , please let me die at your hand ! Remember our friendship and do me a last favor . Kill me ! Kill me ! ' " I stood there paralyzed , mesmerized as in a nightmare . Nomura 's words still haunt me . As I said , he was delirious , and his maddening , high-pitched voice panting out , Kill me , Kill me ! ' The whole scene was like one on a slow-motion , hallucinatory screen . I felt as though I was both in and out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deathly silent , their grotesquely long shadows creepingon the earth . The sergeant 's grip on my arm tightened and I smelled his rancid sweat and felt his body trembling . I heard Nomura gasping , his words no longer intelligible , just a faint whimpering . The captain whipped around to me and grabbed my arm and pushed me toward Nomura . Nomura looked so small . His head on the ground , his arms tied behind his back . Watch me ! ' hissed the captain . He raised his sword . It flashed in the moonlight , pale , deathly white . He slowly brought it down over Nomura 's neck and then flipping the sword around , let the back of the blade touch the neck and Nomura screamed and shrieked and then he was silent . Ip85am sure he died then . Do it this way , hear ! ' barked the captain to me . ' Now ! Do it ! ' He thrust the sword to me . I was frozen still . He slapped me on the cheek . My body was shaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screaming out and fainting . I was sick . My mouth was parched . And the captain slapped me again . My mouth was filling up with rotten , sour saliva . And , like a sleepwalker , I found myself taking the sword from the captain 's hand and taking a step toward Nomura , when the sergeant ran over to the captain and began babbling , You ca n't do this ! You ca n't do this ! ' The captain slapped him away . And then I threw up and collapsed on the ground , half fainted , my mouth dribbling and my insides feeling as though they were tearing themselves up into shreds . And I remember the captain kicking me in the side and I doubling up . So there we were  --  Nomura kneeling down there like a fetus , and I sprawled on the ground like a battered insect . But I was still clutching at the sword , my hand gripping the hilt , my half-dazed eyes seeing its steely white blade that seemed so long on the earth . The sergeant pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ' Then , it happened . The captain took out his automatic from the holster and bent over the back of Nomura . He pressed the muzzle of the gun on the back of Nomura 's head and shot him . He shot him dead with one bullet . I remember the flash of the gun and the black shadows of the soldiers all tangling up and the sergeantletting me go . . . and the captain slowly turning to me and I was standing immobile and I saw him raise the gun and heard the shot and I felt my left shoulder jerk ; then I killed him . I felt the earth was moving , the sky tumbling over my head ; I did not think , I forgot the soldiers , the sergeant , everything , and I was screaming , roaring like a beast and I leaped at the captain with the sword . I do n't know what I did with the sword , how I used it  --  but I cut him from his neck down to his chest . We fell together , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't remember what happened immediately after that . When I came to  --  I could n't have been out for more than a few minutes ,  |p86I  suppose  --  when I came to , I saw the soldiers mounted on the horses , rather , I saw the black shadows of the soldiers and the horses . The captain 's body was n't there , and I could n't see Nomura 's body , either . The shadows began moving . Then I heard a horse behind me . I tried to stand up . I could n't . I twisted myself around to see what was behind me . The sergeant was there with his horse . He had a gun in his hand . I tried to shout , I tried to say something  --  I do n't remember what . But my voice had left me . Only hoarse , unintelligible gasping . He bent down , I saw his eyes peering into mine . I was sprawled flat on my back , delirious but aware of the clear night sky with millions of stars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shadowy , massive face of the sergeant slowly descended on mine . My body was twitching and convulsing . I thought he was going to kill me . I struggled to get up but he pushed me down and I ceased to struggle and let myselfgo and give in to an almost intoxicating sensation of leaden inertia . You are n't dead , ' the sergeant whispered to me . You are n't dead yet . You are n't going to die , understand ? Can you hear me ? ' I opened my eyes . His dark steel helmet was like an enormous mound of graves against the sky with stars twinkling around its silhouette . He whispered again , Wait till we are gone , then run . You run , understand ? ' He stood up , and his giant shadow leaped against me , and I saw him raise the gun in his hand . The flash and the explosionand the shower of dirt . . . and I fainted . I do n't remember how long I was in that state of unconsciousness , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone . I was there all alone , in the middle of nowhere , my shoulder on fire and bleeding , my face smeared with blood and slimy saliva , all my body splattered with the blood of the captain , all alone in the infinite expanse of the great plains of Manchuria , with only the cold , pale , blue moon and the wavering stars looking down on my battered , bleeding , aching body . I began crying . Then the Chinese guerrillas came . " They had just ambushed the Japanese platoon in the village . There must have been more than fifty guerrillas , more like a cav-P87airy detachment . It was a massacre . The Japanese were outnumberedand surprised . Only one third of them managed to get away . The guerrillas took me to the village and I saw bodies all over . Nomura 's body , too . And the sergeant 's , hacked to death . Those who got away must have taken the captain 's body . I could n't find it . You see , I told the guerrillas about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body . But it was gone . Four Japanese had been captured , but the Chinese shot them all before we left the village . Yes  --  it was a slaughter . " And  --  and it was a slaughter here , too , " he said , raising his face toward the dark sky . " Here  --  all those graves out there . I killed them all . I slaughtered them all , do n't you know ! All those North Koreans and their political prisoners , our people ... Our Intelligence had learned that a company of North KoreanSecurity Police was heading this way with over fifty politicalprisoners . Remember , we were on the offensive and they were on the run ; they had been routed out of Seoul . The American armor units were pushing so fast on the western front that they must have thought they had a better chance to escape through this mountainous sector . But they had been spotted by our reconnaissancepatrol and my battalion was given the task of tracking them down . Why they had decided to spend the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at night and hiding out duringthe day . We caught up with them soon enough and trapped them here . We surrounded them in the middle of the night . They did n't know that by dawn I had already positioned my units all around them , all over , on the mountains . We had sealed them in . There was absolutely no way for them to escape from our net . The operation would have been simpler if I had n't had the political prisoners to worry about . I did n't quite know what to do about them . But , first , I had to let them know that they had n't a chance either to slip out from our trap or to fight their way out . It was a steel ring I had set around them . There was not one gap or crack . I wanted to convince them , I wanted to show them , that the onlyP88sensible thing they could do was to surrender . When the morning came , they knew they were trapped . By then , I had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting , and , in addition , I had my regiment send a reconnaissance plane over and have it keep on circling . The bloody sun was rising higher and higher and we alreadybegan to feel the heat . We could see them all . Incredibly enough , they had n't even dug themselves in . They had simply slept through the night in a huddle at the foot of a hill on that side across from where we are . It was unbelievable the way they were there completely exposed to our full view . They must have been out of their wits , having been chased and hunted for so long , and I suppose they were starving and exhausted . At least I thought so . I thought our tactics should be to convince them that they had now come to the end of their run , and to wait , rather than doing anything to provoke them to fight . There were those prisoners , you see . I was willing to wait as long as it took them to lay down their arms and give up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't share my opinion . He wanted an immediate surrender . I had no choice . I spoke through the loudspeaker and demanded that they surrender . To show them that they were completely surrounded , I had my men fire into the sky , one position after another , all around them . " It did n't work . The man in charge of them must have been a fanatic or a madman . He knew he did n't have a chance , but he was n't about to give up . He was herding the prisoners into several small groups , in a circle , and it was obvious that he intended to use the prisoners as shields for his men . We watched and waited . Then someone shouted back to us . They wanted to make a deal . We would let them go and give them one hour and they would set the prisoners free after that . Or else , they would kill the prisoners and fight to the last man . Of course , I did n't believe that they would set the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could n't help believing that they would really kill the prisoners or use them as shields and try to fight their way out . Just to see what they would threaten to do , I replied there would be no such deal . Their commander respondedP89by lining up a group of prisoners in our full view with his soldiers aiming at the prisoners with their burp guns . It was a nightmare . We could see each other clearly , though we had a better view of them . The yellow-green uniform with red shoulder patches .. . I can still picture them . The sun flashing off their guns . We were so close to each other in distance although , of course , we were high up there , and we could hear their footsteps and voices . I called the regiment . The colonel said we would not make any deal with them . We would catch up with them , no doubt , but we would have to go through it all over again . They are just bluffing , ' the colonel said . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else ! ' Or else what ! I spoke through the loudspeaker again . They would n't surrender . The colonel called me and said I should tell them that I did n't believe those were really political prisoners at all but their own men disguised as prisoners to fool us . How do we know these are real prisoners ? ' said the colonel . You tell them that and see what happens . Maybe they are all Commies masquerading as prisoners just to insure their own protection . ' I told the colonel that it was not likely . We saw them . I saw them through my binoculars , these skeletonlike men in rags ! Tell them anyway , ' said the colonel , and see what happens . ' We must n't push them too far , ' I said . These are desperate men and they just might do anything . They might shoot some prisoners just to prove to us that they really are prisoners . ' Then we will know for sure , ' said the colonel . Well , what about the dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prisoners and if those prisoners turn out to be really prisoners , peopleon our side ! ' In that case , the Communists killed the prisoners , not us , ' said the colonel . I ca n't take that chance , ' I said . We ca n't sit there all day and let them stew us . We have to be on the move . We have to push up . That 's an order . ' A fool I was ! I had no choice . I spoke through the loudspeaker again . No sooner had the echoes of my voice faded into the air than they pushed four prisonersout from their defense perimeter , those human shields . The prisoners tried to run . They knew what was happening . And thep90Communists mowed them down with machine guns . I saw it all through my binoculars . The prisoners could n't even run ; they were just staggering away when they were gunned down . I called the colonel . Are you sure they are dead ? Maybe they are faking , who knows ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I shouted back at the colonel , I saw it happen with my own eyes , Colonel ! They are shot to death ! Do I have to tell you that I can see their blood ! ' Well , do n't get hysterical , ' the colonel said . Did you really see the blood ? " l am not playing a game here , Colonel , ' I shouted , and hung up . He called me back instantly . Lob down a few mortar shells , ' he said . That will tell them we intend to wipe them all out , prisoners or no prisoners . That 's an order ! ' I did n't do it . I could n't do it . The colonel called again . I told him I had n't fired the mortars . A moment of silence and he asked me to give him the exactcoordinates of the gorge . I gave them to him and then I knew what he was up to . I got panicky , I pleaded with him not to do it . You see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He gave me ten minutes . I grabbed the loudspeaker and told them that in ten minutesthey would all be blown up by our artillery unless they surrenderedimmediately . We were all going out of our minds . My operations officer kept on saying this was insane , insane , and we should let them all go . We could chase after them with patrols and sniper teams . But it was too late to do anything else . The Communists , too , had gone out of their minds . They began firing at us in all directions . I had no choice . I ordered a few mortar shells lobbed down without hitting them , to show them we really meant it about the artillery . Their firing stopped for a moment , and I called the regiment to hold the artillery barrage  --  and just then the first barrage of artillery whooshed in and that did it . A pandemonium broke out down here . I ordered my men to hold fire and I could see through the rising dirt and dust and smoke the prisoners running and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down by the Communists and the Communists were firing away at us , they too running in all directions . More artillery shells flew in . Thep91air was filled with the explosions of machine-gun chatterings and the smell of powder . I had no choice . Some of them were digging in , some crawling up the mountains . I ordered my men to fire . It was as if my men were mesmerized in a bad dream and just waking up from it still in delirium . Perhaps they had been as frustrated and helpless as I had been , and now , giving in to their pent-up feelings , they poured out everything they had . They were blasting away at everything that moved down below here . Rifles , machine guns , grenades , rockets , mortars ... it was now out of my hands . Down there , we could no longer tell who was what , the Communists and the prisoners , either blown up to pieces , sprawled dead , or still locked in a death struggle . A band of North Koreans somehow managed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were edging toward the northern gap of the gorge . I shouted to my radioman to tell the unit on the hill commanding the northern exit to let them go , but it was too late . As I watched through my binoculars , the last survivingband of Communists and prisoners was pounded on by mortar shells and cut down by machine-gun cross fires . It was all over . We had slaughtered them all . Suddenly it was all very quiet , no one spoke , no one moved ; there was the stinking smell of death all around us , the clouds of dust and hazy blue smoke of powder slowly rising from the bottom of the gorge in the blinding sun . It was all very hushed . Then we heard the drone of the reconnaissance plane that came diving out of the clear blue sky , circling and circlingover our heads like an eagle , like a vulture  --  and the colonel called me to move my battalion to a new position . Yes  --  it was all over . We counted a hundred sixty-four bodies in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call them graves , and buried them all together , the Communists and their prisoners alike . I did not go down the hill . I stayed up there , watching my men drag the bodies out and pile them up , then bury them away . My operations officer had orderedthe bugler to sound taps , and I , engulfed in the waves of the bugle 's echoes , I wept . " I muttered , feeling utterly helpless , " If the prisoners had n't pan/icked you could still have had time to call off the artillery . . . But the Communist commander . . . surely he must have known he did n't have a chance ... " Colonel Min thrust his dark face up close to mine . He spoke in cold fury , " Do you know who my regimental commander was ? It was a certain Lieutenant Colonel Mah . " I saw his eyes glisten in the shadow . " Come ! Let us go , " he said quietly . At the southern end of the gorge , we began climbing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ascent , until at the halfway point of the steep mountain it joined the main route of supply a few miles from the Corps headquarters . On the main road , Colonel Min stopped the jeep . We looked back down toward the bottom of the valley . We could not see it anymore . Cloudlike gray fog , thick and heavy , sealed off the gorge like a ceiling . I faced Colonel Min . " Captain Park . . . he had written me once when I was in Pyungyang . . . about the hand-to-hand combat he and his Marines had . . . in a valley like this . " He nodded . " I know of the battle . It was on the eastern front . " He was silent , brooding . " So , in the end , he went back to God , after all , " he said . " His last words were these : I have been clinging onto the precipice of History , but I give up . I am prepared to take leave ofit. 1 ) " Ah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . His voice rose . " How did I feel looking down at the bloody bottom of this valley ? How did I feel ? I 'll tell you . I felt like a beast . I felt like a beast , do n't you know ? " " That 's enough . Do n't say any more . " He looked up at the dark heavens . " In the dark of night I howl at the sky with all my sorrows , " he said . Tears glistened in his eyes.  | " But there is nothing out there to listen to my story . Do you understand ? " I gazed at his dark face . " No . There is nothing out there , " I said . " No , " he said . His voice was defiant . " We have only our-selves. "  |p94Lieutenant  Cho was waiting for us when we returned to the Corps headquarters . He met us at the gate . I checked my watch with his ; it was five minutes to three . He was on foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We moved away from the glaring lights of the gate and stopped in the shadows . " Is everything all right ? " asked Colonel Min . Lieutenant Cho shook his head . " I am afraid not , sir . You have an unexpected and , if I may say so , sir , an unwelcome visitor waiting to see you . General Ahn from Seoul , sir . He arrived about half an hour ago . He flew in . " I could not help swearing . " What is he up to ? What is he doing here ? " Colonel Min did not stir . Lieutenant Cho said , " At first , he wanted to see General Hyun . He called from the airstrip and talked with the general 's aide , but CaptainYang told him General Hyun could n't be disturbed and told him to see you instead . That was quick thinking on Captain Yang 's part , sir . Anyway , I went down to the airstrip and picked up General Ahn. "  | " How is the situation otherwise ? " said Colonel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communicated with us about General Ham . We have been in touch with our people at GeneralHam 's headquarters . Everything is under control there , sir . " " Has Colonel McKay wanted to see me ? " " No , sir . " " Have the members of the council been alerted ? " " Yes , sir . " " Has General Ahn talked with anyone in the Command Group ? " " No , sir . I made sure of that . " " That was very wise , " Colonel Min said with a grin . " Where are the Group members now ? " " They are waiting for you two , sir . Chaplain Koh , too . " " Where ? " " At Chaplain Koh 's quarters , sir . " " Why there ? " I said . " You see , sir , General Ahn is waiting for Colonel Min in the general'saide 's office and so they did n't want to go to the general 's officeand wait for you two . So they were going to the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his quarters and have some tea . " Colonel Min nodded . " Good . " I said , " Lieutenant Cho , has General Ahn said anything to you about why he came out here ? Has he come alone ? " " Yes , sir . He is alone . No , he has n't said much to me , except to say that it was very urgent for him to see General Hyun . " Colonel Min was quiet for a moment . " How much does General Ahn know about our Intelligence network and operations ? " he asked me . " Nothing , as far as I know . " " Are you sure ? " " Quite certain . "  | " Is there any chance that he might know about our connections with General Mah 's deputy chief , Colonel Son ? " " I am absolutely certain that he does n't know about it . Why do you ask ? " " Just a hunch , Major Lee . We 'll soon find out how much he knows . I do n't like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He could have talked it over with Colonel Hwang of the Airborne , who is looking after my assignments . " " Something 's not right , sir , " said Lieutenant Cho . " What do you mean ? " I said . " General Ahn 's still insisting on seeing General Hyun . I have a feeling he is not too anxious to see you ; I mean , sir , he seems a littledisappointed that General Hyun wo n't see him now . " " Major Lee , do you trust him ? " said Colonel Min . " Why do you ask that ? " " You know him better than I do , I suppose . " I hesitated a moment . " I think I 'd trust him to do the job he 's assigned to . For the coup , I mean . " " In short , you are not endorsing him completely , that is , without reservation . Am I correct ? " " Yes . " " Why ? Why do you have reservations about him ? " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Do you mean his eagerness to assassinate General Mah ? " " He calls it liquidation . " " Well , General Yoon wants the same thing . He is quite eager , too , as you know , to kill General Mah . " " There seems to be some difference between General Ahn and General Yoon , " I said , " in the way they approach the question of what to do with General Mah . " " You 'd better spell it out . " " All right . General Yoon is emotional and impulsive about it , whereas I am convinced that General Ahn seems quite deliberate , cold-bloodedly deliberate about it . It is as if he had it planned for aP97long time , even before the question ever came up in connection with our coup . Do you understand ? " Colonel Min nodded . " Yes . But , then , General Ahn is n't the only one who has thought of assassinating General Mah at one time or another . " " I am merely questioning his motivation . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of silence , he said , " I want you to come with me to see him , but I want you to make sure that you do nothing , say nothing , to let him know that we have infiltrated into General Mah 's headquarters . Is that clear ? I do n't want him to know anything about Colonel Son . Also , not a word about General Ham . Lieutenant Cho , you have n't told him about General Ham , I trust ? " " No , sir . Not a word about that , sir . " " Good . " " Why all this precaution ? You do n't trust him either , do you ? " I said . " I do n't know . Just being prudent , I suppose . Let him talk and we 'll listen but we 'll not take him into our confidence , for the time being . Lieutenant Cho , Major Lee and I will see him in the general 's office and I want you to go to the chaplain 's quarters and tell the others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen to run into General Ahn later on . Not one word about it . All right . Let 's get this over with . " " All right , " I said . " Remember this , Major Lee . Should General Ahn mention anything about or in connection with General Ham , we know nothing about him . Do you understand ? Nothing whatsoever about where he is now , or nothing about his plans for a secret rendezvous with GeneralMah . " We drove on toward the general 's office building . Then Colonel Min changed his mind . " I do n't want to talk with him in there . Lieutenant Cho , you go in and tell him we are waiting for him outside . " Colonel Min swung the jeep around and stopped it in thep98middle of the headquarters plaza . Lieutenant Cho hurried off to the general 's office . We walked away from the jeep toward the tanks and the helicopter . Here and there , the shadowy , massive , squattingforms of tanks loomed in the misty night air . We stood under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door open at the general 's office . In the hazy light of the lamp over the entrance , GeneralAhn paused for a moment , speaking to Lieutenant Cho . LieutenantCho was pointing his hand toward our direction . General Ahn came , limping . We gave him a salute . " Let 's cut out the formality , shall we ? " he said cheerfully . " I did n't come all the way out here for that . " " General , it is a pleasant surprise , " said Colonel Min . " Well , I must say it is good to be out on the front . You know me . I feel much more at home out here than back in Seoul at my desk . Good to see you again , Major Lee . " " Surprised to see you , General , " I said . " I left you only a short while ago . " " I know , I know , " he said . " I tried to get hold of you back in Seoul but it was too late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to get in touch with you in time , I would n't have had to make this trip , which I am sure you , Colonel Min , think might be too conspicu-ous . " " I am afraid it is , " said Colonel Min . " I understand you wish to see the general . " General Ahn tucked his cane under his arm . The silver tip of the cane gleamed faintly in the dark . " Colonel , let 's be quite frank with each other , shall we ? That 's why I said we should cut out the formality . Of course , I did n't come out here to see the general . I came out to see you . I do mean that , Colonel , because , well , we sha n't go into that now , shall we ? " " As you please , General , " said Colonel Min . General Ahn turned to me . " I do hope you wo n't be offended if I say this , but I should like to have a talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  |p99Colonel  Min said , " I would like Major Lee to be present , sir , if you do n't mind . And , if you do n't mind , Major Lee . " " I do n't mind , " I said . General Ahn said quickly , " If you say so , Colonel , of course I do n't mind . After all , Major Lee here is my special assistant , too , not that I have seen much of him lately . " He laughed . " We are very grateful to you for your consideration , General , " said Colonel Min . " You are quite welcome , Colonel . Anything for our cause . " Colonel Min said , rather coldly , I thought , " What brings you out here , General ? " " Well , where shall I begin ? The import of this information is so staggering that I hardly know where to begin . Have you seen or have you been in touch with General Ham recently ? " " No , " said Colonel Min . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid we have a traitor on our hands . General Ham has been in cahoots with General Mah . " Colonel Min kept quiet for a while . " I do n't believe it , General , " he said . " I know I must believe your words , but I ca n't quite bring myself to believe that General Ham would sell us out . He has nothing to gain but everything to lose by going over to General Mah 's side . " " Ah , but that we do n't know , " said General Ahn . " How do you know about it ? I mean , General , where and how did you get this fantastic information , if you do n't mind my asking , sir ? " " In my position , I do have my own sources and resources of intelligence , as Major Lee well knows . But this one will surprise you . I was told about General Ham by General Mah in person . " " I beg your pardon , sir ? " Colonel Min seemed genuinely surprised . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't understand this at all , General . " " I told you this is fantastic . Shortly after you left , Major Lee ,  |p100General  Mah called me up and asked me if he could drop by my of-fice . " " Just like that , " said Colonel Min . " Yes , just like that . I must confess I was frightened out of my wits . I was absolutely sure our plans had leaked and General Mah was rounding up every one of us . I was n't about to be arrested sittingat my desk . So , to see what he was really up to , I suggested he come to my house . He said he would . As you know , I live out in the outskirts , rather isolated , and it is close to the camp of my CommandoGroups . If General Mah is going to make a final move , I said to myself , I am going to put up a good fight . I had my Commando Groups alerted , naturally . I had defense plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreeable to my suggestion , I was quite taken aback . " " So you two met at your house , " I said . " Yes . Looking back , I ca n't help laughing at myself , but , at the time , I was expecting a swarm of his agents charging in . Well , he came alone  --  that is , with his aide and the driver who did not come into the house with him . " Colonel Min said , " In what car , General ? " " What difference does that make ? " said General Ahn . " Just being curious , sir . Was it a black sedan , 1958 Plymouth ? " " No . It was his own jeep . " " Marked ? " " Yes . " " Was it a Headquarters jeep or a Presidential Brigade one ? " " I am puzzled by your curiosity . It was the one belonging to the Presidential Brigade . " " Thank you , General . Sorry I interrupted you . " " May I go on now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me about General Ham . " " Specifically about what , General ? " I said . " General Ham has contacted General Mah and has requested a secret meeting with him . "   " When ? " Colonel Min said . " Tomorrow evening , " he said . " I mean , this evening now that it is already morning . " " Do you know the details , sir ? " Colonel Min said . " That General Mah would not tell me about . I am sorry . He had good reasons not to tell me too much about what had gone on between them . He is bargaining . Colonel , he wants to make a deal with you . " " I beg your pardon , sir ? " said Colonel Min . " Why with me ? Does it mean that he knows of our plans ? " " What do you think ? Of course he does . But I hasten to assure you , as he did me , that , at the moment , he is the only one who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been someone who gathered the information for him . " I said . " Naturally , " said General Ahn . " But General Mah would not reveal his source . Only to say that as long as he is alive , the secret is safe with him . " I snorted . General Ahn said , " Consider this . I now have , rather , we now have information that General Mah wanted to defect to our side . That , I assure you , is serious business and we now have that advantageon him . If this piece of information ever leaks out , he is in for it as much as we are . What he wants is this . He knows all about our plans for the coup . Who we are , where we are , and so on . He claims he has gotten hold of our organizational secrets and to prove that he has , he cited several names at random . Yours , Major Lee 's , and mine , of course ; the general , and the members of the Command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Colonel Min said . " Not so fast , Colonel . Before we know what he wants , we must understand why he wants what he wants . Here is the situation . He tells me that the Americans have been pressuring the President to fire him . Well , we do know that the Americans have become dis-P102enchanted with General Mah and have been trying to get rid of him . Of course , General Mah is the favorite of the President and the President has been resisting the Americans . Well , this time the President is giving in . That 's what General Mah believes . In any case , he thinks he is about to be sacked , and you know what will happen to him once that comes through officially . Everyone will be out for his blood . Now , there are so many important people involved with him one way or the other that he can never be brought to a trial , which will spill all the dirt and filth , the goings-on among the higher circle of our government . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him quietly , " said Colonel Min . " Precisely . Not so quietly , though . It will make lots of noises . He will be assassinated and the North Korean agents will be blamed for that , naturally . " " With the President 's sanction ? " I said . " Naturally ! What do you think ? " said General Ahn . " I am beginning to see a certain pattern in this , " said Colonel Min . " It is beginning to be a little clear to me . " " I am glad you say that . I was terribly confused by all this , but then something happened . I am going too fast . So , General Mah 's deal with you , Colonel Min , is this . He will release the hostages he now has in confinement , turn over to you all the documented results of his investigations of public and private lives of practically everyone who is somebody in this country . We are all included , of course . And he will quietly help our coup to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ openly in our coup and he does not think you will welcome his open participation either . He will understand your feelings about him , and , then , he still has a bit of conscience left in him not to turn against the President who , after all , is his benefactor . These are his words , not mine , mind you . That 's what he said . " " And what does he want from us in return ? " said Colonel Min . " One of two things . Either a command suitable to his rank and experienceon the front line , presumably a corps but he would set-P103tle for a division ; or a safe-conduct and passport for him to go to Europe . He said nothing about money . I am sure he has taken care of that problem , and he knows he is not welcome in America . He wants to go to Europe . Switzerland , most likely . " " And if we refuse his deal ? " " Colonel Min , you keep saying we , we , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am sure you understand why . " " No , sir , I do n't . We all stand or fall collectively . We are all in it Jtogether , General . I am not running a private show . " " I understand what you say , of course . Well , if you , if we declinehis deal , I am sure I do n't have to explain to you what he will do . " " What will he do , General ? " I said . " Do n't you know ? " " I thought , General , that you were quite willing to take care of him before he made his move , " I said . " You mean  --  kill him ? " " Yes , sir . " " What do you think , General ? " said Colonel Min . " Do you think he is telling us the truth ? And if so , do you think we should accept his deal ? " " I think he is telling us the truth . I have proof of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about killing him . You see , now there are people other than us who would be glad to liquidate him . We may not have to do anything . " " You mentioned a proof ? " said Colonel Min . General Ahn looked at us both and dropped his voice ; in a whisper , he said , " There was an assassination attempt on his life . He almost got killed . " Shocked , I was about to question him for details , when I became aware of Colonel Min 's brooding silence ; I did not speak . " How did it happen , General ? " said Colonel Min . " How did it happen ? How would I know ? All I know is what did happen . " " What did happen , sir ? "   " Just think . I could have been killed , too . You see , General Mah wanted me to come out here to see you about his proposals . I had no alternative . I agreed to do that . He was happy about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy me a drink , and take me out to dinner . He said he was a lonely man ; he had no friends and so on . And I believe him . He is a lonely man . " " He is an evil man , " I said . " You sound as if you have forgotten all about that , General , if I may remind you . " " There is no question about his being an evil man . " " Did you go out to the dinner ? " said Colonel Min . " I almost did . I said I would come with him . I wanted to go easy on him , you know . I wanted to tread softly . I felt as though I were holding a live bomb in my hands and it might , it could , go off any moment and blow all of us sky-high . You know what I mean . Then he changed his mind and said that for both of us to be seen together would n't be good . It would be too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must say I was glad he said that and was glad to get out of the dinner . I did n't want to be seen with him . " " So he left your house without you , " Colonel Min said . " That 's what happened . I saw him out of the door of my house and stood there for a moment to watch him go . Major Lee , you know my house . It 's on a hill , Colonel , and a long driveway goes down the hill and joins the main street . From upstairs in my house , you can almost see the end of my driveway . It was raining still , rather hard , and I was standing there in an upstairs room , watching General Mah 's jeep going down the driveway and onto the street , when I saw a dark brown sedan speeding up from behind General Mah 's jeep . I saw it all . The splashing of rainwater all around the sedan as it rushed up and passed , rather , came parallel to the jeep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the sedan sped off and disappeared from my sight . The jeep had crashed into bushes along the road by then . I ran downstairs and joined my aide who also heard the shots and we ran down the driveway  --  andp105there was the jeep , in the bushes , smoking away . I thought it might explode any moment . Then we saw General Mah staggering out of the jeep and the bushes . We ran to him and got hold of him . He was covered with blood , all over his uniform , hands , face . He had a .45 automatic in his hand which I had n't seen before , but it belonged to his driver . My aide saw to that . The driver was dead . And his aide , a captain , he was dead , too . The driver , a sergeant , was shot in the back , twice , I think , and the captain was . . . well , you might say he was riddled by the submachine-gun bullets . It was a horrible sight . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me about some of the people he was suspicious of trying to kill him and there he was being machine-gunned at . A hairbreadthescape ! And just to think that I could have been with him , sitting in the back seat of his jeep . " " Who was he suspicious of trying to kill him ? " said the Colonel . " Naturally , he did n't name them . Some people in the Army Intelligence , some in the National Police , some National Assemblymen , a few cabinet ministers , and then the American CIA . " " Why the American CIA ? " said Colonel Min . " They would gain nothing by killing him . " " I do n't know why he mentioned it . Perhaps he knows too much about their operations here . " " He could n't be the only one who knows too much about the American operations in this country or in North Korea . " " Well , Colonel , I would n't know . That 's what he seemed to im-ply . " " General Ahn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by any chance ? " " Do what ? " Colonel Min said , " Major Lee refers to this unsuccessful assassinationattempt on General Mah 's life . " General Ahn looked us over , then he laughed aloud . " I wish I had , " he said . " And if I had tried it , I would n't have bungled it up like that ! " We were silent for a moment.  |p106General  Ahn said , " There is more to General Mah 's proposal . " Colonel Min said , with what I thought was an undisguised sense of weariness in his voice , " Yes ? " " He told me that he had agreed to meet with General Ham this evening . " " You told me about that , General , " said Colonel Min . " Yes , so I did . But there 's more . He proposes to arrest General Ham and his intimate associates , if you know what I mean . Arrestthem and hold them in Seoul . For you , Colonel Min , that is . After the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you and you can do whatever you want to do with them . " I said , " In short , he wants to play a game with us with human lives . " General Ahn ignored me . Colonel Min said , " And what do you say to that , General ? " " Well , since you are kind enough to ask my opinion on that , I suppose I should be frank with you and tell you precisely what I think you should do . " " You mean what we should do , " said Colonel Min . " All right . What we should do , then . I think we should kill them all . " " I beg your pardon , sir ? " I exclaimed . " Do you mean to say that ... " General Ahn said , " Let me finish what I was saying , Major . This is what I think should and could work out . To our immense benefit and advantage , naturally . We should pretend that we would go along with General Mah 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him but that it is our modus vivendi , you might say , to cooperate with him at this time . He would understand that . After all , we should n't appear too eager to accept his deal . He might suspect us . We would tell him that we would like to see some concreteproof of the authenticity and genuineness of his intention to carry out his part of the deal . " " What sort of proof , for example , sir ? " I said.  | " Arrest General Ham and his cronies , as he says he would . " " Why not ask him to kill General Ham ? " I said . " That is perhaps a better idea , Major . It did n't occur to me . Itdid n't occur to me that you would be the one to suggest that , either . " Colonel Min said , " Now , this proof we are talking about . Whatdoes it really prove to us about General Mah ? " " Nothing , " said General Ahn quickly . " Nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said . " Look ! He is capable of committing every conceivable evil act without blinking an eye , " General Ahn said impatiently . " He would kill General Ham for no other reason than to make him look good in our eyes . Do n't you understand that ? " " Yes , I do , General , " I said . " But if he really goes through with it , would n't that be a tangible proof that he would abide by his part of the bargain ? " " Are you willing to take him up on his deal ? " said Colonel Min to me . I paused for a second . " Yes , " I said . " If his deal is genuine , I think we should accept it . " " Then what would you do with him ? " said Colonel Min . " Exile him , " I said . " That 's better than spilling his blood , you mean , " said Colonel Min . " Yes , " I said . " Are you saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Colonel Min . " Perhaps after he goes into exile , we could try him in absentia and that would expose to the nation all of his crimes . And , perhaps , we could strip him of his citizenship . " " Heavens ! " said General Ahn . " You are a cruel man , Major ! " I retorted , " I ca n't think of anything more cruel than killing him . " " You want him to have a slow death ! " said General Ahn . " If we should decide to accept his deal , " I said , " I do not see anyalternative. "  | " Who said we should accept his deal ? " said General Ahn . " I said we should pretend to take him up on it . " " Then what ? " said Colonel Min . " What , then , do you say we should do , having pretended , as you suggest , to accept his deal ? " " Listen ! Nothing he would do will ever prove to us that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatsoever ! We do n't really know why he is behaving this way . We shall never know . But that does n't make any difference . What makes a difference to us is that he now has his fingers in our plans for the coup and he can explodeus all to bits . It so happens that he is about to be sacked by his boss and he is full of vengeance . At least , that 's what he says . But there is no reason on earth whatsoever that we should believe him . Is that clear to you ? No reason whatsoever . The problem for us , I think , remains basically the same . General Mah simply has to be liquidated . He 's got to be killed . And General Ham , too , that dirty , double-crossing betrayer . " " In that case , why did you suggest that we should ask General Mah to offer us an evidence of his good intention by arresting or killing General Ham ? " " To get them together , " General Ahn said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said . " To get them together . Why ? " said Colonel Min . " We would kill them both at the same time , " said General Ahn in a whisper , though there was no one around to hear us . " Do n't you understand that ? We can liquidate two birds with one stone , so to speak . " He laughed again . Colonel Min was silent . " I am not sure if I like the direction our conversation is heading , " I said , " if you allow me to say so . We are talking about humanbeings , General . Not some sort of lifeless objects that can be broken apart or put back together at our will . " " Here comes your idealism again ! " General Ahn said . " But that will get you or us nowhere for our coup . Why do n't you try to understand that ? And why do n't you agree with me that you 'll leaveP109all the dirty work of the coup to someone like me and Colonel Min here and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Colonel Min . " I am sure Major Lee did not mean anything personal about you . " " Of course , I understand that , Colonel . To tell you the sincere truth , I admire your idealism , Major . I do mean it , Colonel . Surely , after the fire and smoke and din of our coup are all cleared up , we do need people like Major Lee to get down to the real business of the coup , that is , the humane purpose and program of rebuilding and reshaping the country and the people . " " You want to kill both General Mah and General Ham , " said Colonel Min . " What is your plan on that , General ? " " Simple . You people will trail General Ham from this end and I will trail General Mah from my end . That is , if we ca n't discover their plan in time . Or , I may even suggest to General Mah that he let me or you , Colonel , if you like , accompany him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confirm his good intentions . I can have the place , wherever it may turn out to be , ringed with my Commandos . " " Suppose General Mah brings his men with him ? He could easily mobilize units from the Presidential Brigade , " said Colonel Min . " Ah , he wo n't do that . He ca n't ! Remember , every one of his movements is constantly being watched . Whether or not that is true , we do n't know . But , since that is what he told me , he could n't possibly do a thing like that when he knows that we are also watching his movements . " " What is the rest of your plan , General ? " said Colonel Min . " We will kill them both as I said before . We will make it appear as an act of damned Communist agents from the North . Ah , some such thing . Simple enough . Or , it could be some sort of shooting it out , so to speak , between them . Everyone knows they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to play it by ear , I suppose . If General Mah 's story about the assassination conspiracy against him is true , and I think it is true  --  after all , I saw one happenright before my own eyes today  --  as I was saying , if the storyP110is true , then , we can assume that there wo n't be a thorough investigationfrom the government sources . As to what to do with GeneralHam , well , we can simply remove his body from the scene and dispose of it somehow . I can take care of that . " " Why not remove both bodies and dispose of them both , General ? " I said . " What is it ? Am I running a funeral home ? Ha , ha , ha ! Well , I can do that , too , I suppose . Actually , that seems to be a better idea , Colonel . Major Lee , you surprise me . You are far , far ahead of me in thinking this thing out . But then , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Min said , " After you dispose of the two bodies , what then ? " " Why , a green signal for our coup , " General Ahn said . " There wo n't be anything standing in our way after that . " " It all sounds very simple , " said Colonel Min . " It is simple , " said General Ahn . " You 've made it sound very simple , General , " said Colonel Min . " Ah ! I am a man of simple nature , Colonel . At least , I would like to think I am . I value simplicity and incisiveness . Getting right down to the heart of the matter , you see . But , I am afraid it will have to be a little bit complicated this time . " " It is already quite complicated enough , " I said . " I do n't quite know where to begin and where to end in this matter . " " Anything else on your mind , General ? " said Colonel Min . " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my position . I do n't know how to put it to you in such a way that you 'll not be offended . " " I can hardly imagine anything coming to me from you that could offend me , " said Colonel Min . " I should appreciate every word you say to me in connection with our coup . " " All right , then , since you put it that way . Very gallant of you , Colonel . Well , here is a hitch , so to speak , to what we have been discussing . In spite of what I said to you , Colonel , General MahP111wants to deal with you all collectively . That is , with you , Colonel , and with the rest of the Command Group . " Colonel Min gave me a quick look . He said , " General , that seems hardly surprising to me . In fact , I think that 's the way it should be and it will be . I would n't have it any other way . If I were in General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would n't you , General ? " " I ca n't really blame him for insisting on that , to tell you the truth , " said General Ahn . " You see , I told him that there was no need to make his deal collectively with everyone in the Command Group . I told him it would be more than sufficient and acceptable to everyone concerned if he and you two got together and worked this out . But , he wanted to be sure . Well , he is worried , to begin with , and then he is n't the kind of man who would trust others and I doubt if he trusts even himself . " I said , " Since we are supposed to kill him and General Ham anyway , I do n't see why all this is necessary at all , General , this business of collective bargaining . What difference does it make , sir , if General Mah is going to be killed ? " Colonel Min said , " Major Lee , you do n't understand . What GeneralAhn is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wants us to trust him . Well , until General Mah settles his score with General Ham , I think we 've got to show up as a group . And then we will take over from there . As a group . Am I right , Gen-eral ? " " I am glad you said that , Colonel , I must confess that I do feel a little uneasy about assuming personal responsibility for liquidating them all by myself . I hope you understand my feeling . After all , I am not made of stone . I do have feelings . So , if we do this as a group , I think I would feel much better about the whole thing . Besides , the credit should go to us all as a group . " " We shall all be guilty , is that it , sir ? " I said . " I was n't talking about any kind of guilt , " General Ahn snapped . " What guilt ? Quite the contrary , Major . We are going to make theP112entire country proud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after our coup . " Colonel Min said , " Nothing to get excited about . We will put this matter to the Command Group , and I am sure there wo n't be any objection to our accepting General Mah 's proposals and request , as long as he keeps his part of the bargain . " " I have no doubt whatsoever that he wo n't , " said General Ahn . " After all , from his point of view , his life depends on it . " " Either way he looks at it , " I said . General Ahn laughed . " Major Lee , you really are beginning to see it my way , are n't you ? Unless , of course , you meant it as a sarcasm , the nuance of which I might have failed to catch on to , eh ? " " Enough , gentlemen , " said Colonel Min . " No time for indulging in sentimentality . What we need now is daring and decisive action , do n't you think so , General ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's why I always thought you were a man born to action . Oh , yes , I know lots about you . All about you , in fact . By the way , have I ever told you about this North Korean colonel , a security officer , who knew you ? I am sure I have n't . Well , it was a pity because I had to have him shot later anyway , whether or not he knew you in the old days . " Colonel Min said , " I see . " General Ahn cluck-clucked . " Yes , he kept saying that if I checked with you about him he was sure you would try to help him . You see , he claimed that he had once saved your life . Before you came down to the South , that is . We captured him in one of our commando raids near Sariwon . Actually , he said you , too , saved his life . So it seems you two saved each other 's life , so to speak . Does it ring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , I knew him . In the old days , as you say . " " He told me you had shot your way out of the Russian garrison in your own hometown and he had helped you escape . Was he tellingme the truth ? " " Why do you ask ? "  | " Well , if what he told me was true , I thought you should have put that in your service records . After all , you shot the Russian garrison commander and quite a few Russians and I would call that daring bravery , which should be recognized and properly rewarded . But you had n't done that and I always admired you the more for that . So , although I 've known about it all this time I have n't mentionedit to anyone out of my respect for your silence . Daring and decisiveness , Colonel , as you said . You are a born man of action and , if I may say so , a born leader . There 's no denying that . " Colonel Min said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be shot . Indeed , I would have tried to help him . " " Well , I am sorry about that , too . But it was such a long time ago and the whole thing was very hectic those days , as you know . " " When did it happen , General ? " said Colonel Min . " Let me see now . That must have been shortly before we took Pyungyang . That makes it early part of October , nineteen-fifty . That 's right . Now I remember it all clearly . Yes , that 's it . " Colonel Min said , " I see . " " Well , I did n't mean to drag it out , " said General Ahn , " but I just wanted you to know what I think of you . " Colonel Min did not respond to that . General Ahn said , " Now , shall I wait around to see how the CommandGroup decides on General Mah 's proposals or would you get in touch with me later ? " Colonel Min looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said with a cheerful casualness that I had n't thought he was capable of exhibiting , " Oh , well , General . Actually , there is n't any compelling reason for having to go through the formality of group discussion and voting on this matter with the Command Group . Do you understand what I am saying , General ? I think the matter is as good as settled right here between us . No need to delayit , is there , General ? I say this is settled and that should be quite enough . " General Ahn said , " I am relieved to hear that , Colonel . Time isP114of the essence . We 've got to hurry now . You will lead the CommandGroup then ? " " Of course . " " I will fly back to Seoul right now , " said General Ahn . " There are a lot of things to do . If either of us finds out anything more about General Mah and General Ham , we will be in touch . I am sure I 'll have something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . General Mah will now have to tell me the details of his meeting with General Ham . I suppose you would n't want to approach GeneralHam from this end in any way ? " Colonel Min shook his head . " No . I think it best to let him think we are completely in the dark about his meeting with General Mah , do n't you ? Obviously . " " Obviously , " said General Ahn . I cut in . " I would like to protest this , Colonel Min . As a member of the Command Group , I would insist on bringing the matter to the Group . You two have decided to kill both General Mah and General Ham , but we do n't know how the members of the CommandGroup would feel about that . I , for one , will not accept that extreme measure , and ... " " Shut up ! " barked Colonel Min . " Stay out of this , Major ! " General Ahn grinned . " Now , now , gentlemen . No need to get all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I know how you feel about killingpeople and I am sorry you feel that way . But do n't you realize you are outnumbered in this matter ? The Command Group with the exception of you had already decided on this . You will have to accept the majority decision , Major . " I could n't help shouting . " Or else ! " " Or else ! Or else ? " Colonel Min spoke in a mocking voice . " If you refuse to accept the majority decision , you will simply have to be removed from the Command Group . " I could not control my rage . " In that case , if that is your ultimatum , I resign from the Command Group ! "  |p115General  Ahn stepped forward and put his arms around us ; his cane touched my back . " Now , now , you two . What is this ? Let 's stop this quibbling , shall we ? We 've got far more important things , our coup and the destiny of our country , to worry about . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now . I will leave you two and I am sure you will come to a satisfactory understandingwith each other . Remember , we are fighting against our common enemies and not among ourselves . " I disengaged myself from his theatrical embrace . Colonel Min said quite viciously , " Major Lee , I want you to go to my quarters and wait for me . That 's an order . " He said to General Ahn , " I 'll drive you out to the airstrip , General . We can settle on the details on our way . " Without a word to me , Colonel Min strode away toward the jeep between two tanks . General Ahn followed him , limping , squishing mud under his shoes . The thin fog still clung to the ground . The jeep 's engine started with a roar . I suddenly felt desperate , confused , and forlorn . The headlights shot out of darkness . I was outraged . The world around me stank with evil and deception and murderousblood . I felt alone . The jeep drove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hissing in a whisper charged with raging fury . Bloody murderers ! Oh  --  you bloody murderers ! What country , what people , what poor , innocent , suffering people are you trying to save from what  --  you blood-reeking , beastly murderers ! I felt like weeping . I felt my heart ache with the pain of now realizing that I had naively let myself be tricked into undertakingthe work of professional killers , extortionists , blackmailers , corrupt agents of evil , devils themselves on all sides . I was shaking with rage and guilt and remorse . I could not restrain myself from shedding burning tears , with frustration , indignation , and bitterness . I was there in the misty darkness all alone , surrounded by machines of death and evil men and the evil world . With a shudder , I knew that I was standing on the very threshold of unspeakable horrors of evil beyond redemption . I felt like shouting . I wanted top116shout  --  to claim my innocence back , to proclaim to the world that there was still within me a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the innocent . And , then , suddenly , I felt a soothingbreeze of hope , a delicious , delirious hope for myself , and I deeply inhaled a comforting breath of hope and then  --  a brilliantepiphany  --  a thought flashed in my mind and stood before my vision like a beatific rainbow : Blessed are the pure and the innocent , for they shall inherit the earth . I smiled , in spite of myself , for I now knew what I had to do.  |p117I  found my jeep in the parking lot nextto the general 's office building . There was not enough gasoline in the tank to make it back to Seoul , but I did not worry about it . I drove down the dark driveway lined with armored cars and medium tanks toward the main gate . The harsh , glaring light flooded the guardhouse and the two tanks . I slowed the jeep down and pressed the horn . I saw two MP 's in the guardhouse , then saw four MP 's lined up just beyond the guardrail , their figures in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floodlight . None of them made any move to lift the guardrail for me . I blew the horn again , and brought the jeep to a halt a few yards from the rail . I leaped out of the jeep . One of the MP 's stepped forward to meet me across the rail . I did not have a chance to utter a word . The sergeant saluted me , and said , " Sorry , sir . Colonel Min 's orders , Major . We are not to let you pass . " I had not expected this . In confusion rather than in anger , I blurted out , " What is it ? Am I under arrest ? " He said , " Oh , no , sir ! We ca n't let you pass through here . That 's all , sir ! Colonel Min wants you to wait for him . "  | " Colonel Min said that to you ? " " Yes , sir . He gave me the orders on his way out to the airstrip . Just a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colonel Min had been able to calculate precisely what my every move was going to be . I could not help feeling slightly peevish . I raised my voice . " Sergeant , you know who I am , do n't you ? " " Yes , sir . " " In that case , you 'd better let me pass . " " I am sorry , sir . " " I shall crash through . " I made a move back to my jeep . " Please , sir . I am just following my orders . " I went back to him . " Lift the rail . " " Please , sir ! " I ignored his plea . I tried to push the rail up . It would not budge . " Give me a hand , Sergeant ! " He did not stir . I tried again , harder , and the rail , with a creak , lifted itself up . I went back to my jeep and flung myself into the seat . Then I saw the MP 's , including the sergeant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For a moment , I did not know what to do . I cut the engine off . The sergeant came over to me . " Please , Major . " " Very well , Sergeant . I shall wait here until either you move your men away or Colonel Min gets here . " " If you promise , sir , to wait for Colonel Min , I 'll be glad to move my men away . " I heard a telephone ring within the guardhouse . An MP called out to the sergeant . " It 's Lieutenant Cho on the line . " The sergeantexcused himself and ran into the guardhouse . I could not make out his voice on the telephone . I saw him nod a few times . He came back to me . The other MP 's now lowered their submachine guns . " Lieutenant Cho will be here in a minute , sir . "  |p119There  was n't much I could do . I nodded in silence . The sergeant saluted me . " I am sorry , sir . " He went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . I started the engine , backed the jeep up away from the light , and waited for Lieutenant Cho . There was n't much else I could have done . I should have been angry and indignant at the way I had just been treated by the MP 's  --  at Colonel Min 's orders ; but , strangely enough , I was not ; I was more tired than anything else ; a sheer physical exhaustion overpowered me and my mind felt a leaden inertia . By the time Lieutenant Cho drove down and stood before me , the only thing I wanted was to go to sleep . " I am sorry about this , sir , " said Lieutenant Cho in whispers , peering into the jeep . " Colonel Min called me from the airstrip and asked me to make sure that you wait for him . I do n't know what has happened between you two , sir , but please , Major , I wish you would n't do anything rash , if you 'll forgive me for saying that . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I snapped . " Am I under arrest ? " " I wish you would n't speak like that , sir . Of course not , sir . Who would think of putting you under arrest ! " " Do the others know about this ? " He shook his head . " Of course not , sir . They are now over at the general 's office . " " Why ? " " Colonel Min wanted to call a meeting of the Command Group , sir . He wants you to be there . " " I did n't think he would want to call the meeting of the Command Group . " " I would n't know about that , sir . " " It seemed to me Colonel Min and the others had already decided what to do with General Mah . " " I beg your pardon , sir ? I do n't understand . " " Well , have n't they already decided to kill him ? " " You mean  --  formally , sir ? Voting and all that ? "  | " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know of , sir . I know the feeling of the Group , but I know of no formal resolution . I should know about it , sir , after all  --  I am the secretary . " " Do you mean to tell me that there has n't been a vote on this matter ? " " No , sir . " " How does Chaplain Koh feel about this ? " " I do n't know , sir . He has n't said anything about General Mah . " " Well , I am sure he feels the same way I do . " " What do you mean , sir ? You are in favor of not killing him off ? " " Yes ! " " I really do n't understand you , sir . I mean , sometimes . " " I am sure you do n't understand me . Well , never mind . " " Yes , sir . In any case , would you please come and join the Groupfor the meeting ? " " I would rather wait for Colonel Min here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , sir , if you wish . But , please , Major , wait for him . " I nodded . " I will then see you there soon , Major . " I nodded again . He drove back to the headquarters . I woke with a start . Colonel Min was sitting next to me in the jeep . I found myself stretched against the seat . I sat up . " Sorry to wake you up , " he said . " I know you must be tired but we 've got lots of work to do . Do you feel up to it ? " I rubbed my eyes and stared at him . " The MP 's told me what happened . I am sorry about that . I did n't think you would really try to leave . " " I was on my way back to Seoul . " " That was silly . " He laughed . " There 's nothing amusing about that 1 "  | " I am sorry , " he said . " What did you have in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you put it , I would call the meeting of delegates from other services to overrule the decision of the Command Group . " " And you think you would succeed ? " " I would do my best . " " Oh , come now . Let 's stop this nonsense . " I flared up . " There 's nothing nonsensical about my trying to stop needless bloodshed and murders ! " " Listen to me ! And let me finish what I have to tell you before you interrupt me . I am sorry that I appeared to humiliate you in front of General Ahn and with the MP 's , but I had to do that , do n't you understand ? I wanted to have General Ahn hear what I told the MP 's to do about you . Of course , as I said , I did n't really think you would try to leave , let alone try to crash through the gate ! I wanted to convince General Ahn that I believed every word of his . I am surprised you did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telling me that you were playing a game ? " " Yes . " " Why ? " " Why ? I am really surprised that you still do n't understand . We are all playing an elaborate game here . General Mah is playing a game , so is General Ahn , and so are we . For the time being , we have to play along . I wanted General Ahn to hear what he wanted to find out about our setup here , which I have no doubt he will reportback to General Mah . " " I still do n't quite understand . " " It is this way . We do not yet know whether or not General Mah 's proposals and his motivation for making those proposals are genuine . That we will soon find out . Colonel Kim is checking it out with Colonel Son right now . We shall soon see about that . Now , I am not so certain as to why General Ahn wants to rule out categoricallythe possibility that General Mah may genuinely want to make a deal with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempt on General Mah 's life , Colonel Kim is also checking it out with our people in Seoul , and I will see Colonel McKay about that , too . The American CIA may have something on that . In any event , I am a little uneasy about the way General Ahn has insisted on killing both General Mah and General Ham , that is , before we have a chance to find out just what General Mah may be up to . Do you understand ? " " You are questioning General Ahn 's motivation ? " " Yes . Just as you have said to me before about him . " " I told you he 's too damn bloodthirsty ! " " I am not particularly worried about that part of it . I am more interested in what I think is a slip of the tongue on his part . " " What do you mean ? " " What he said about the North Korean colonel . " " The security officer who knew you ? " " Yes . " " You see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , I saw him die , before my very eyes . In North Korea . Near the thirtyeighthparallel . " " Did you kill him ? " " You seem to have already judged me as a bloodthirsty murderer , have n't you ? " I did not reply . " And that 's why you wanted to leave . What were you trying to do ? Wash your hands of me ? Of us all ? " I kept silent . " Do you really want to withdraw from the Group ? " I remained silent . " Well , make up your mind ! " he shouted in fury . " Do you want to join our coup or not ? Do you want to see your coup succeed or not ? Do you want to save the country or not ? Do you want to save our people or not ? Answer me ! " " Save the country , save our poor , suffering people ! " I shouted back . " Save them from what ? Do n't you realize we are becomingP123more and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have pledged ourselves to save the country and the people ! We are becomingjust like General Mah and his cohorts ! " He shook his head with a sigh . " Good and pure do not necessarily and automatically come from good and pure . The world of man is not made that way . When will you ever see that horrible truth ? " " If it is not made that way , then we shall try to make it that way . We 've got to begin somewhere . " He did not speak . " We 've got to begin somewhere ! " I went on . " Do n't you see that ? Otherwise , it will be an unending circle of hell we will be helping to enlarge . The vicious circle has got to be broken somewhere . And we 've got to take upon ourselves that task . We 've got to make a clean break somewhere , sometime , now ! " With his eyes closed , he nodded his head . " Yes . Yes . You are right , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Then you will change your mind about killing General Mah and General Ham ? " He sat up straight . " I have not made up my mind about that ! " " Oh ? " " No , I have n't . And I did n't kill that North Korean major , either . " His voice was weary . " Would you believe me ? " " Yes . " " Thanks . Now , would you come with me to the meeting ? I shall put the matter of General Mah 's proposals and also the question of what to do with him before the Group . We shall vote on these . Would you come and stop talking about withdrawing from the Group and all the rest of your nonsense ? " " On condition that you would try your best to influence the decisionof the Group . " " How ? " " Obvious . We should not decide on a course of action which will force us to commit senseless crimes . " " Would you commit sensible crimes ? "  | " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared to commit a necessary murder ? " " You do n't have to be so sarcastic . I do n't like your mocking insinuation . " " I sha n't force you to answer my questions . All right . You have my word that I will do my best to influence the Group to go along with your way of thinking . Just this once , mind you . Will you be prepared to accept the majority decision ? " " I would rather not commit myself to that at this time . " " Nonsense ! I am giving in to your demand and I should have at least a promise from you that you will abide by the decision of the majority of the Group . " " Is n't it obvious that my motion will be outnumbered ? " " Do n't be so sure of that . " " Is Chaplain Koh going to be there ? " " Yes . " " Would you be able to persuade General Yoon to side with us ? " " I suppose . He will do what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case , all right . I give you my word that I will abide by the Group 's decision . " He nodded . " All right . " " Tell me before we go . About this North Korean major . You did n't kill him but you saw him die with your own eyes . " " Must you know ? " " Yes . " " He killed himself . " I could not help exclaiming . " I do n't understand ! Then why ? Why ? I mean , General Ahn 's story ? " " That 's what I want to find out about . " " I am confused . I mean , I ca n't quite grasp the meaning of this all . I ca n't begin to see the implications . " " There is always the possibility that the North Korean major might have lived , although even if he had n't died as I believed he had he would not have had a chance to live . They would have shot him anyway . "   " I am completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian major , the garrison commander in my hometown . He strangled him to death . " I said , " I thought you had killed the Russian ! " He glowered at me . Without a word , he left my jeep and strode over to his behind mine . He started up the engine and drove off . I thought I heard him as he passed me : " Come along ! " I followed behind him . The conference room adjoined General Hyun 's office . It was a simple room , barely furnished except for a plain wooden table and a dozen or so steel folding chairs ; a shaded lamp dangled from the low ceiling ; that was all . We sat around the oblong table . Colonel Min sat at the head of the table , quietly smoking his pipe . Chaplain Koh was seated at the other end of the table directly across from Colonel Min . There was Colonel Song , in charge of Personnel ; Lieutenant Colonel Kim , Intelligence ; Colonel Park , Operations ; Colonel Moon , Logistics . Lieutenant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hyun 's aide-de-camp , sat behind Colonel Song . I sat next to Chaplain Koh . There was an empty chair next to Colonel Min , which would have been occupied by General Yoon of the 34th Division . " All right , gentlemen , " said Colonel Min , " let 's get this over with . I think we all know why we are meeting here . I do n't suppose I will have to explain any more about General Ham . We have arrestedhim , and General Yoon will keep him at a hideaway in the 34th Division sector until our coup is over . We will release him after that . That will be our policy on him for the time being . Colonel Kim , what is the situation at General Ham 's headquarters ? " Colonel Kim said , " Fine . It could n't be better . As you all know , General Ham 's deputy commander is away in Japan at the moment . His chief of staff is on our side , and Colonel Bang , the Operations , is fully in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in short , is solidly behind us . In this particular circumstance , keeping GeneralP126Ham out of sight will pose little problem . Everyone , including General Mah , knows that General Ham pulls this sort of stunt rather regularly ; I am referring , of course , to his unpredictable behavior , such as disappearing into the mountains for a few days of hunting and fishing . Especially , General Yoon 's being his cousin helps . Colonel Min , you will take care of his American advisers ? " Colonel Min nodded . " Colonel McKay will see to that . It will be done discreetly , I assure you . " Colonel Kim said , " I have something rather important to report but I will wait . " He spoke with a thick Northern accent ; tall and muscular , he folded his arms over his chest , his eyebrows knit closely , his sharp eyes staring at his notes in front of him on the table ; he had commanded a battalion in the war and had taught at the National Defense College . He looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'll wait till you are finished with the others . " " All right , " said Colonel Min . " How about you , Colonel Song . Anything new ? " Colonel Song shook his head . " No . Nothing new to report . " At the age of forty , Colonel Song was the oldest of the Group , except for Chaplain Koh ; a sleepy-eyed , gentle man , he chain-smoked and was fond of quoting Confucius and boasting he was the only grandfather in the entire Corps , whipping out his wallet which contained , American-style as he put it , a folded packet of pictures of his granddaughters and his daughters ; a lovable man , a graduate of Tokyo Imperial University with a degree in economics , he had commanded a regiment on the east coast in the war , twice wounded in action . Colonel Park was saying , " . . . we now have three contingency plans , any one of which is highly desirable and flexible enough to meet our objective . The coordinations between the participating units from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to the last detail , and I thank Major Lee for the operationsplans to occupy Seoul . We can start anytime . As we stand now , we can mobilize one fourth of the entire armed forces . Otherwise , no change to report . " Quiet , efficient , brilliant , few wouldp127have thought that his ambition had been to become a concert pianist ; drafted by the Japanese in his third year at a conservatory in Tokyo , he had become a lieutenant in the Japanese Army ; wounded in Burma , he was captured by the British and later was allowed to join the Korean unit in the Chinese Nationalist Forces ; he had commanded a battalion in the war , taught at the Military Academy , and studied in America and observed the military establishmentof Scandinavian countries and Israel ; a reserved , a soft-spoken man , whose one luxury in the Army , in his words , was to have the Army ship his piano wherever he went , in peacetime , of course ; he was fond of Chopin and , as Colonel Min @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the war , who played a duetto with a very eccentric British brigadier who had to have his piano even under enemy artillery fire . Now he sat brooding , silently puffing on his cigarette , doodling in the notebook in front of him . " And how about you , Colonel Moon ? " said Colonel Min . " Not much change . We wo n't starve , I will guarantee that . " Colonel Song laughed . " Ah , that 's the spirit ! " " But I can use more gasoline , " said Colonel Moon , his dark face frowning . " We now have three days ' supply of gasoline and fuel for armored units . I would be glad to scrounge up some more . At least five days ' supply . Could you talk to Colonel McKay about that ? " Colonel Min nodded and looked back to Lieutenant Cho , who was making notes . " How about ammunition ? " " Plenty , " said Colonel Moon . " Depends , naturally . But once the Marines take the depot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ColonelMoon , a former lawyer , a misfit in the Army as he would say , had joined the Army during the war as a specially commissioned major ; he should have been a legal officer or a legislative liaison officer but the Army had turned him into an expert in logistics . He said , " Seriously now , I depend on Colonel Park to take the depot in Seoul as quickly as he can . Without having it all blown up . Otherwise , I ca n't guarantee that we will have enough supplies for every unit in action , just in case we might have to put up a hell of ap128fight  --  the contingency plan number three , that is . We will have to send in one of our divisions from here in that case and I wo n't have enough for an entire division . I 've scalped them enough already out here . " Colonel Park said , " We will do . Do n't worry . " Colonel Moon said , " Ah ! I have to worry . It is in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " All right , we will go over this again with our people at General Ham 's headquarters , " said Colonel Min . " Chaplain Koh , sorry you did n't get much sleep tonight . Will you be ready to fly down to Seoul in the morning ? " " It is morning already ! " Chaplain Koh laughed . " Of course , I am ready anytime . " " Major Lee reports that everything is under control in Seoul . You will get in touch with Colonel Hwang of the Airborne . " Chaplain Koh nodded . Colonel Min said , " Captain Yang , how is General Hyun ? " Captain Yang smiled . " Sound asleep , sir . I did tell him that GeneralAhn was here . He wanted you to take care of him . He said General Ahn should n't have come out here . " " Well , Captain , General Ahn 's gone back to Seoul now , so you can report to the general that everything is under control . You will not , however , report the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " No , sir . " " That I will do personally . Understood ? Does the general know about General Ham ? " " Not yet , sir . " " Good . I will take care of that , too . " Colonel Min turned to the Group . " Colonel Kim , would you rather I made my report first and then you would brief us on your latest intelligence ? " " Yes , I think so , " said Colonel Kim . " Please go ahead . " Colonel Min nodded , putting his pipe down on the table . He leaned over the table , clasping his hands in front of him , surveying everyone , one at a time , his face revealing a faint trace of a smile . P129He closed his eyes for a moment and when he had opened them his face had turned into a mask of impassivity . " Gentlemen , as you know , General Ahn has paid us an unexpected visit , and Major Lee and I have had an extremely interesting and significant conversation with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a subdued monotone . He did not take long to relay the substance of our conversation with General Ahn to the Group . " There are a few things we have to clear up before we can really understand the implicationsof the situation , " he said . " And I think we are now ready to hear from Colonel Kim who had been in touch with Colonel Son and others in Seoul . I 've also asked Colonel McKay to check with his people in Seoul to see if the American CIA and their other intelligenceagencies know anything more than our people do . He will be here shortly . All right , Colonel Kim , make your report now . " Colonel Kim shuffled through his papers , numbering each sheet with a pen . " Here we are , gentlemen . This is as much as I can now report . More will come in later , I am sure . Now , let me begin chronologically . I have to explain that what I have tried to do , for the time being , was to double-check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lee . So , as I said , let me go through this in sequence . General Mah did have a telephone conversation with General Ahn . They have a direct line between them as we know . Now , we do not know as yet who called whom first . General Ahn has said that General Mah had called him first , so , for the time being , we will have to assume that that was the way it happened . Next , General Mah left his headquarters with his driver and his aide in a black sedan , 1958 Plymouth , with a civilian license plate . He went to the headquarters of the Presidential Brigade , where he left the Plymouth and changed into a jeep , covered . It was raining at the time . He proceeded to General Ahn 's house in the outskirts . Oh , yes . He made a telephone call while he was at the Presidential Brigade , but we are unable to find out whom he talked with . Our agents followed General Mah 's jeep and confirmed that General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Colonel Min said , " Have the agents reported any sign of activityp130at General Ahn 's house ? For example , have they seen any of GeneralAhn 's Commandos in or near the house ? " Colonel Kim shook his head . " No . No sign of activity . All very quiet . If General Ahn had expected any trouble with General Mah , well , he had kept it to himself . " " General Ahn told me he had alerted his Commandos , " said ColonelMin . " Have you checked with our people there ? " Colonel Kim nodded , and said with a frown on his face , " We have failed to authenticate General Ahn 's alert to his Commandos . Either he had forgotten to alert them or he is lying . " Colonel Moon said , " That is a very serious charge against GeneralAhn , Colonel Kim . " Colonel Kim said , " Yes , it is . Let me go on . Unfortunately , we are unable to check on what went on inside the house . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assure you we would have had the house bugged . But it was too late . " Colonel Park said , " Perhaps somebody else has already bugged the house . Ask Colonel McKay about it , Colonel Min . I would n't be surprised if the American CIA has already bugged the house . " Colonel Min said , " Has Colonel Son had any information on that ? " Colonel Kim said , " I regret to say we have n't gone into that . I 'll take care of that . Now , our agents confirmed the assassination attempton General Mah . No , it was n't General Ahn 's doing , although I first suspected he might have done it himself . The description given by General Ahn checks out with that reported by our agents . A dark brown sedan , a 1957 Ford , with civilian license plate , which our agent was unsuccessful in identifying . It does not matter at this point , because the sedan was found later abandoned in an alley behind Duksoo Palace . This piece of information comes from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been stolen ; it belongs to a member of the National Assembly , who had reported to the police about the theft . He checks out all right . It was a genuine case of theft . But , here is an interesting item . The theft ofP131the sedan was reported to the police approximately half an hour after the telephone conversation between General Mah and General Ahn had taken place , and we have tried to pinpoint the exact time of the theft and it comes out that the theft , according to our calculation , took place about the time General Mah was at the PresidentialBrigade and made his telephone call . " Colonel Moon said , " Are you working on the assumption that the assassination attempt was faked by General Mah himself ? Those coincidences and circumstantial evidences you seem to be accumulating ... " Colonel Kim nodded . " Yes . The fact is that there is nothing coincidental about it . The dark brown sedan was seen by our agents to rendezvous with General Mah 's jeep near the Seoul National University Hospital . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over to the sedan which pulled up behind the jeep . The rendezvouslasted two minutes , then they parted . " " This is very serious ! " said Colonel Song . " Not that I doubt General Mah can do this . But is there any possibility that GeneralAhn was in on it , too ? " Colonel Kim said , " We are not sure at this time , but , so far , there is no evidence that General Ahn was in cahoots with General Mah 's diabolical scheme . " I said , " But how can we explain the deaths of General Mah 's aide and his driver ? They were gunned down while they were riding with General Mah , who himself was wounded . " " No ! He was not wounded , " snapped Colonel Kim . " But General Ahn said he was , " said Colonel Min . Colonel Kim said , " Either he was lying or exaggerating . " Chaplain Koh said , " You do n't like General Ahn , do you , Colonel Kim ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do n't ask me why . I just do n't . " Chaplain Koh said , with a smile , " I hope your dislike of him does not color your judgment . " " I am aware of that , Chaplain . Believe me I am . I am going byp132the factual evidences here , and as far as I can evaluate the situation , General Ahn is either too dumb to see the truth or too shrewd to pretend that he does n't . " Colonel Min said , " We will soon find that out . Do you have more to report ? " " Yes , sir . Gentlemen , we now come to the question of whether or not General Mah , as he is supposed to have told General Ahn , does indeed know of our plans for the coup . Has he really uncovered our organizational secrets ? Has there been any security leak on our side ? Has he really discovered our plans or is he merely playing a guessing game ? If he does know of our plans and organizational setup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Colonel Kim paused and quickly went through his papers . He held a small sheet of paper in his left hand and tapped on it with his pen . He went on , " Gentlemen , this is the report from Colonel Son . As far as Colonel Son knows , General Mah knows nothing about plans for the coup . " Colonel Min said , " Are you implying that General Ahn has deliberatelylied to me ? " " If General Ahn has indeed told you that General Mah knew of our plans and organizations , then I am inclined to think that he was indeed deliberately lying . Why was he lying ? That I would n't know . I am not denying that General Mah has no suspicion whateverof a coup . It is in his nature to suspect a coup at any time , always , but I am reporting here that , as far as Colonel Son is concerned , General Mah 's suspicion has not yet reached a point where he could name names and pinpoint our organizations and so on . " Colonel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than I thought . " Colonel Moon said , " Colonel Kim , is there any way to find out if General Mah may really know of our plans and Colonel Son may not know about that ? " " Colonel Son is checking up on that right now . But I doubt very much that any information this important would have gone undetectedby Colonel Son . To my way of thinking , the questions be-P133fore us are , first , whether or not General Mah was simply playing his guessing game as I 've just mentioned ; second , whether or not General Ahn has deliberately lied to Colonel Min and Major Lee ; third , whether or not General Ahn has indeed defected from us and told General Mah all he knows about our plans . " " And you suspect General Ahn 's defection ? " said Chaplain Koh . Colonel Kim took his time ; he glanced around the table , and said quite simply , " Yes . " " But why ? " said Colonel Song . " We shall soon find out , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you too , then , suspect his defection ? " He said , " We now have a simple problem of whether we believe in Colonel Son or in General Ahn . Any opinions ? " " If I may paraphrase your statement , Colonel Min , " said Colonel Moon , " the problem is whether we believe in Colonel Son , the deputy to General Mah , or in General Ahn , who has pledged his loyalty and support to our cause and , also , who has just as many reasons as any of us has for hating General Mah . " " There is no question about Colonel Son 's loyalty , " said ColonelKim . " I 'll stake my life on that . " " That 's a pretty strong endorsement , " said Chaplain Koh . " If General Mah has indeed uncovered our plans , " said Colonel Park , " would he have waited this long before he would take actions against us ? Would he have gone through this elaborate game with General Ahn and with us , too ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Colonel Song . I began to lose my perspective of the whole situation ; I did not know where it all had begun and where it would all end ; it was all very confusing and bewildering . I could not help thinking , however , that there had to be a simple solution to all this , somewhere ; and we had to find the solution , somehow , soon , before it all got out of control . I ventured , " There must be a simple explanation to this somewhere . " " No , there is n't , " snapped Colonel Kim . " I wish there were . "   " Ah , patience , " said Colonel Min . " It will all come to light soon . I should like to repose my question . Do you believe in Colonel Son or do you believe more in General Ahn ? " Colonel Moon said , " I am afraid we will have to discredit General Ahn 's words , some of them anyway . There was the question of whether or not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colonel Min that he has . We ca n't find any evidence that he has . And then this question of whether or not the assassination attempton General Mah 's life was a fake one . General Ahn reported that it was a genuine attempt . He may not have known otherwise , but we know it was a fake one . Then we have this conflicting report as to whether or not General Mah knows of our plans . I am afraid General Ahn 's case is not a very convincing one . " Colonel Park said , " Colonel Kim , does Colonel Son know about the meeting between General Mah and General Ahn ? " " Yes , of course . " Colonel Park said , " I meant to ask if General Mah has told Colonel Son about it . " Colonel Kim looked triumphant . " I am glad you brought that up . No . Not a word about that . Colonel Son is pretending that he knows nothing about it . " " Why should n't he have told Colonel Son about it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Now , why should General Mah have picked out General Ahn and not someone else ? " He paused to look around . " That is , if he had uncovered our plans and wanted to make a deal with us with that information as bargaining leverage ? " Colonel Kim said , " Yes . Why not directly with you , Colonel Min ? " He answered his own question . " General Mah does not yet know of our plans or our organizational setup . Colonel Son 's words check out on this point . " Colonel Song said , " If this is a case of General Ahn 's defection , then why is General Ahn so insistent on killing General Mah ? " I said , " General Ham , too . "  |p135Colonel  Moon said to Colonel Min , " You think General Ahn 's insistenceand plans for killing them are genuine ? " Colonel Min nodded . " He really wants to kill General Mah  --  andGeneral Ham , too . Why General Ham , too , that I would n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretending ? " said Colonel Moon . " I am quite sure . " " I am not sure if I understand all this , " said Chaplain Koh . " I am racking my brains to see a pattern in this but I do n't seem to be able to find one . " Colonel Min sat up straight in his chair . " Let me ask you this , gentlemen . Are we convinced that General Mah does really know of our plans and organizations ? " No one replied in words , but the general sentiment was apparent . Colonel Min looked at everyone . " All right . In order to untangle this cobweb of a situation , we shall have to assume , for the time being , that General Mah knows nothing about our plans for the coup , beyond his suspicion . Now , then , I should like to pose my next question . Is General Mah about to be sacked from his position , as General Ahn had told us , that is , General Mah himself is supposed to have told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information on that ? " Colonel Kim went through his papers again . " Colonel Son 's reportis that it is genuine . General Mah is indeed about to be fired from his position . General Mah has complained of this to Colonel Son on several occasions . He was quite bitter about it . Since it has been alleged by General Mah that the pressure from the Americans has been instrumental in persuading the President to decide on firingGeneral Mah , I am wondering if Coloney McKay might have something to enlighten us with . Without some assurance from the Americans , I would think that the President would not quite dare even seriously consider firing General Mah casually . It takes one evil man to understand another evil man , and they are two of a kind . They understand each other all right . " Colonel Min said , " I 'll check with Colonel McKay on this . " Hep136lit his pipe . " If the story about General Mah 's impending dismissal is true , why would he go about faking his own assassination ? Going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driver killed  --  just to make it look good ? What is the motivation behind this ? " Colonel Kim said , " May I interrupt ? " Colonel Min nodded . " Go ahead . " Colonel Kim said , " According to Colonel Son , who examined the bodies of General Mah 's aide and the driver , the bullets which killed them both were of .45 caliber , which makes it very hard to determine which bullets were fired by whom . " " Wait a second , " said Colonel Park . " Are you saying that .. . This is horrible . Do I recall that , at the scene of the assassination attempt , according to General Ahn , General Mah was seen with a .45 pistol in his hand which belonged to his driver ? " " Right , " said Colonel Kim . " The driver was shot in the backtwice . Two .45-caliber bullets went through his body , shatteringhis back . The .45-caliber bullets could have been fired from any.45 pistol or from any .45 submachine gun . The aide was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one in theshoulder , and one in the head . He was riddled , completely blasted . " Captain Yang said , " I knew him . He was my classmate at theAcademy . I 've always told him to get away from General Mah . " " Too late now , " said Colonel Song . " I am sorry for him . " Captain Yang said , " He  --  he did try to get himself transferredtoColonel Min cut in . " That 's enough . " " Yes , sir . " " You do understand me , do n't you ? " said Colonel Min . " Yes , sir . I am sorry , sir . " " All right . Now , let 's get back to the question of General Mah 's motivation for staging this fake assassination attempt . Any opin-ions ? " Colonel Song said , " I ca n't quite fathom the depth of Generalp137Mah 's demoniac mind at this point , but whatever was his motivationfor it , he must be in a desperate situation , and I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think we will have to go cautiouslyon this . You do not push a desperate man too much . Yes , it seems he is faced with a desperate predicament , a last-ditch battle for his own survival , you might say . " Colonel Kim said , " If this report that he is about to be sacked is true , and it seems the report is true , then I agree with you , Colonel Song , that General Mah is in a desperate position and he will do anything under the sun to save his skin  --  murder , blackmail , defection  --  defection to us or to the Communists . I am not discountingthat last possibility . He will do anything to save his neck and he is capable of doing what the Devil himself would not dare do . " Colonel Min said , " What makes you think of that possibility , Colonel Kim , that General Mah might even think of defecting to the Communists ? " Colonel Kim grinned . " Oh , I do n't know . It just popped into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Communists would simply shoot him , would n't they ? " Colonel Kim said , " He can always bargain with them . " Colonel Min said , " Yes , that 's true . I suppose we ca n't dismiss that possibility . But , then , does this possibility have anything to do with General Ahn ? " He did not wait for a reply . He went on quickly , " Colonel Kim , how much information do you have on GeneralAhn , besides his service records ? " " Not very much , sir . Why ? " " I want you to start working on him . Fast . Can you do it ? " " Yes , of course . But why ? " " I would rather not go into that at this time . " " Whatever you say . " Colonel Park looked up from his notebook , in which he had been writing with a pencil . " Well , here we are , " he said almost in a whisper . " I have been working on a theory about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting somewhere . Would you like to hear about it ? " " By all means ! " said Colonel Song . " You beat me to it ! ' ' Colonel Min smiled . " Let 's hear it . " Colonel Park gave Colonel Min a penetrating gaze , then looked about him . His long dark hair fell over his large forehead . He pursed his lips and rested his chin on his right hand which held the pencil . " All right . Here it is . I have been going on the assumption that General Mah does not know of our plans , but he is suspicious of something brewing in the air . Everyone in the country is , as far as I know . I have been also going on the assumption that General Mah is indeed going to be dismissed from his position , which would mean not only an end to his career but also a mortal danger to his life . There will be so many people who would go out of their way to skin him alive . He has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hate to be in his shoes at a time like this . Anyway , if we go on these two basic assumptions , I think we may begin to see a certain pattern in all this tangled situation . I think what happened between General Mah and General Ahn may be this . When General Mah received the message from General Ham who proposed a secret meeting , General Mah must have thought that something really big was in the making somewhere . His suspicion of a possible coup was doubly strengthened and he began grinding out his schemes . He starts casting his eyes about , trying to see who might be hatching a plot against him and his beloved President . He thinks about General Ham . No , he says to himself , General Ham is too ambitious , too ambitious , mind you , not simply ambitious as any man would be . No , General Ham is too ambitious to take a chance to risk everything he has . He will bitch , pout , grumble , but an either-or proposition , no , he wo n't take that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seoul who has under his command a sufficient number of combat troops who might be willing to challenge the Presidential Brigade ? General Ahn , the Commander of the Commandos , a young , ambitious , discontented hero who thinks he deservesmuch more than he 's got . All right . So General Mah sets outp139to build up an elaborate trap . I think General Mah baited General Ahn . Perhaps this is how it happened . General Mah tells General Ahn that General Ham has already spilled the secrets about an impendingcoup and has implicated General Ahn . General Ahn is baited and he swallows the bait . He is panicked , but he is shrewd enough to see that the reason General Mah came to him is that GeneralMah is willing to make some sort of a deal . That means althoughGeneral Mah may know something about the coup plans he does not yet know the full details of the plans . So , General Ahn is willing to hear what General Mah has to say . " Colonel Min said , " May I interrupt you for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Colonel Min said , " It seems to me that you are assuming that what General Ahn has told us is true , that is , General Mah , although he has latched onto our plans , is willing to make a deal with us . He might even cooperate with us and so on . Are you sure we can trust that ? " " I am sorry to say that there is no other way in trying to decipherthis business . I have to go by that assumption . " Colonel Kim said , " I kick myself for not having bugged the goddamnhouse ! " " Well , we did n't know it would come to this , " said Colonel Song . " Do n't blame yourself . " " But still , " said Colonel Kim . " Goddamn , I should have known better . " Colonel Min said , " All right . Let Colonel Park proceed . " " Colonel Min , may I ask you something ? " said Colonel Moon . Colonel Min nodded . " I have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about General Ahn , am I right ? " Colonel Min did not reply . Colonel Moon went on . " We have considered the possibility of General Ahn defecting from us . But your feeling toward him seems much more than that . Would you like to speak on that ? " " I would rather not go into that now , if you do n't mind . Every/thing in proper time . I am more anxious to hear the rest of Colonel Park 's theory , are n't you ? " Colonel Moon said , " Certainly . " Colonel Park was scribbling in his notebook . He looked up . " A new idea came to me , " he said . " Well , let me continue . Now , where was I ? Oh , yes . So  --  General Ahn is willing to hear what General Mah has in mind . Whatever General Mah might or might not have said to General Ahn  --  that we would probably never know . The truth , I mean . But I am tempted to think that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other , each pretending to know enough about the other , and at the same time pretending to know nothing . General Mah is n't telling General Ahn all that he claims to know about the coup plans . General Ahn , on the other hand , is n't spilling it all to General Mah either . They are bargaining , bit by bit . I think this may be what happened . General Mah pretends that he knows the people involved in the coup plans but deals with General Ahn in such a way as to suggest that if General Ahn were to be spared , from General Mah 's threat , that is , then General Ahn will have to prove himself to be in good faith with General Mah . How can he prove himself to be bargaining in good faith ? General Mah suggests obliquely that General Ahn help him get in touch with the ringleaders of the coup plot . Then he will see what he can do for General Ahn . I am sure he offered a deal more concrete than that , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the moment , short of interrogating General Ahn . I am sure General Mah put it all to General Ahn in such a way as to let his words appear to mean either of these : help me round up the ringleaders , or help me make a deal with them . But , of course , GeneralAhn thinks he is shrewd enough to have no delusion about what General Mah really means : help me round them up . But when General Ahn comes out here , for some reason , he conveniently forgetsabout that part of the game . So  --  General Ahn has agreed to the bargain , whatever it may be , and they set out to hatch a scheme , the substance of which has been related to us by General Ahn . This hocus-pocus about General Mah wanting to make a dealp141with us and all that . Then General Mah pulls a brilliant though diabolical stunt . I refer , of course , to the fake assassination attempt . Now , why this bloody melodrama ? Let me line up a few possible explanations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remind you that General Mah has not confided in his trusted deputy , Colonel Son , our trusted ally and confidant , about his secret meeting with General Ahn or about the fake assassination melodrama , although he did confide in him about General Ham 's proposal for a secret meeting . Why ? That I do n't know and I ca n't even begin to speculateon it . Now then , why this horrible melodrama ? Number one : It will provide General Ahn with a convincing and convenient piece of information in trying to persuade us to believe that General Mah 's intended defection to our side is genuine , that General Mah is , indeed , about to be fired and is in a mortal danger of his life itself . Number two : It will convince General Ahn himself that GeneralMah may be really bargaining in good faith , that he may indeed want to defect to our side . This , I think , General Mah has succeeded in accomplishing , that is , sowing a seed of doubt in General Ahn 's mind . Number three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then we can assume that there may be some people who would be anxious to kill him off before he may resort to a lastminute , desperate , dirty trick . Perhaps the President himself may be anxious to have him quietly put away . After all , doing away with him may prevent possible political scandals and also provide a good excuse to blame the Communists for the killing . In any case , General Mah can either throw every one of his political enemiesoff his guard or confuse them all by plunging them into hushhushspeculations as to who has done it , thereby buying time for himself . Number four : General Mah can do either of the two ; one , he can build up a convincing case that the North Korean Communistsare really out to get him  --  he is that valuable in our fight against the Communists ; it reminds everyone of the presence and threat of Communist terrorism among us ; and General Mah is sorely needed to combat the Communists  --  an old story ; two , GeneralMah can go to the President with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both of them are in the same boat and the dear President needs him more than ever . You can almost hear General Mah saying to the President , Your Excellency , please give me time and I 'll show you what I can do for you as I have always done . I 'll crack down on the plotters and crush the plot . Your Excellency , sir , then you will know you just ca n't get along without me , you understand ? ' Number five : General Mah will go to the Americans . He knows they are ready to cash him in . He knows they have been pressuring the President to fire him . But he thinks he knows the Americans  --  ah  --  these childish , naive , simpleminded Americans , he thinks , who would rather hang onto a status quo by hook or by crook than bravely and stoically face the challenges of uncertain , confusing , chaotic , unpredictable changes such as a coup d'etat . In his wishful thinking and ignorance , he will conveniently forget all about the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No doubt , he will tell them that a Communist-inspired and - led coup is in the making  --  another old story . Now , this is as far as I could go . " No one spoke for a while as though each of them had to take time to ruminate on Colonel Park 's words . I felt helpless ; I could not help feeling that way ; the more I tried to see my way clear through the tangled mazes of the situation , the less articulate my reasoning became , and the more bewildered and impatient I became in my effort to find  --  rationally , logically , and sanely  --  a way out of this seamy , seedy , sordid , and evil scheme of things . I glanced over at Colonel Min , who seemed to be looking into the bowl of his pipe ; a thin gray smoke was curling up from the pipe . He looked up . " Colonel Park , " he said , " you did say you had a new idea ? " Colonel Park nodded . " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having speculated on the possible motivations of General Mah 's deliberatelyunsuccessful attempt to kill himself , let me tell you just one more thing which I think is more important and interesting than all the rest . The question simply is this . Why  --  just why  --  did General Mah feel confident enough to approach General Ahn , of all people , and why  --  just why  --  is General Ahn , of all people ,  |p143undertaking  this unsavory task of brokerage between General Mah and us ? " Colonel Min said quickly , " Precisely the point . Why indeed ? " He jabbed the hazy , smoke-filled air with the stem of his pipe . " If you had n't raised that question , Colonel Park , I would have brought that up myself . " Colonel Kim said , " I do n't trust him . " " We 've considered the fact that he commands the Commandos at a stone 's throw from the Presidential residence , " said Colonel Moon . " Something is not quite right , " said Chaplain Koh . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved in this . What a mess ! " Colonel Min said , " Once more , I would like you to weigh the fact that General Ahn tried his best to persuade me , first , to bring you all to the rendezvous with General Mah and General Ham ; second , he wants to kill them both . He wants that very badly . Major Lee here thinks he is too damn bloodthirsty . Well , I have no doubt about that . But , in this particular case , there is something a little more than his being simply bloodthirsty . Let me tell you what I think . From what we know and from what Colonel Park has just explicated for us , I think I will have to say , to my regret , that GeneralMah seems to have something big on General Ahn . What is it ? What could it possibly be that is important and big enough to make General Ahn wriggle and dance to the tune of General Mah 's flute ? " " The implications of your words are quite sinister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Min kept silent . Colonel Kim said , " I am a little worried . Perhaps we should n't have let him go back to Seoul . " Colonel Min said , " I thought of that myself . I had a good mind to have him kept here , but that would n't have worked out . General Mah knows about the trip . " I said , " Obviously , General Mah knew and even approved GeneralAhn 's trip out here , and if so , General Mah has not taken anyp144action as yet . Does this mean that General Mah 's deal or his intentionfor defection is genuine ? " " A good point , " said Colonel Moon . " We shall see . Very shortly , " said Colonel Min . " Colonel Son has been instructed to keep his eyes open at his end . If , gentlemen , if General Mah should decide to act against us in any way before this evening 's rendezvous , Colonel Son is ordered to execute his contingencyplan number three : Kill him . " Colonel Kim nodded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Colonel Min said , " If not ? That brings us back to the original purpose of this meeting : What do we do with General Mah ? " Colonel Kim said , " Kill him . " He looked at everyone . " We 've got to strike him first . The situation is getting out of hand . It is either him or us . " Colonel Min said , " Colonel Park ? " " Are we going to the rendezvous this evening ? " " No matter what we decide to do with General Mah , " said Colonel Min , " we will have to keep the appointment , do n't you think ? Presumably , this is a rendezvous between General Mah and General Ham . We have been invited to join the party as an observer if I may put it that way . To witness , ostensibly , the good faith of General Mah in his proposition to us . " I spoke out , " I am willing , more than willing , in fact , to work this out on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I believe it is to our best interest and to the image of ourselves in carryingout our coup to avoid unnecessary bloodshed at any price . From what we know , General Mah 's own position is being threatened by his own people , and that fact itself seems to confirm the authenticity if not sincerity of his expressed desire for defecting to our side . I think we should give him the benefit of the doubt . " " In short , you do n't want to kill him , " said Colonel Kim . " I am not worried about tainting the image of ourselves . The whole country is going to say , A good riddance ! "  | " It will still be on our conscience , " I retorted . " This is a coldbloodedmurder we are talking about , Colonel Kim ! " " Well , we are talking about a cold-blooded murderer himself 1 " said Colonel Moon . Colonel Min said quietly , " All right . We are going to the rendezvousthis evening . Any objection ? " He looked around the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we are not all of us going to be there . We are not ready to honor that part of the bargain , is that clear ? I shall go there myself . " " I am coming with you , sir , " said Lieutenant Cho . Colonel Min nodded . " I do n't like the smell of it , " Colonel Kim said . " Let me go in-stead . " " I ca n't spare you . " " We ca n't spare you , either , " said Colonel Park . " You know that . " " If you do n't mind my saying so , this is far too important a matterfor me not to undertake myself . I am going to exercise the prerogative of the chairmanship . The coup can be carried out without me , but without any one of you , no . I shall go alone . If any of you is worried about my safety or security problem , do n't . Colonel Son knows what he is supposed to do if it should come to a showdown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to desert us at this time . I believe he really wants to kill General Mah . I am sure he will come prepared for that . As I said before , General Ahn appears to have a very solid , urgent reason for killing General Mah  --  and General Ham , incidentally . Trust me on that . I repeat . General Ahn wants to kill General Mah . So  --  I shall go alone but I will not be alone . I will have Colonel Son and General Ahn . " I said , " I would like to volunteer to come along . After all , I am the special assistant to General Ahn . " Colonel Min gazed at me for a long moment . His eyes were cold . " All right , " he said almost in a whisper . " I would like to put this to a vote , " said Colonel Moon.  | " That wo n't be necessary , " said Colonel Min . " If you insist , " said Colonel Kim . " I 'll make sure you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodded . " Good . That is settled . I would like to see you later , Colonel Park , about the contingency plan number four-teen . " The contingency plan number fourteen was about the structure of the chain of command for the coup and the provisions for commandtake-over in case of emergencies . Colonel Park said , " Yes . " " Good . Now , I should like to propose that we vote on the question of what to do with General Mah . Kill him tomorrow evening or accept his deal if it should prove to be genuine or kill him in any event . " I said , " I request that the last item be struck out . If his deal is genuine , there is no reason for us to kill him . Once we are certain it is genuine , we should accept it in good faith and carry out our part of the deal . " " General Mah would n't have any scruples about not carrying out his part of the bargain , " said Colonel Kim . " But , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happens , " I said . Colonel Moon sneered , " It will be too late then . " Colonel Park said , " I do n't think any more argument is necessary . So  --  let 's vote . " Colonel Min looked at Chaplain Koh . " Allow me to say this , Chaplain , but you are free to abstain from the voting . " I spoke out quickly , " I do n't think that is fair . " " Not fair to whom ? " said Colonel Kim . " To Chaplain Koh , " I said . " Ah  --  do n't argue , " said Chaplain Koh . " Thank you for your consideration , but I shall gladly participate in the voting . " " Good . All right . I think we 've talked about this enough . LieutenantCho , are you ready for us ? " " Yes , sir . " Lieutenant Cho stood up from his chair . He wentp147around the table , placing a small index card in front of everyone . The card contained two words : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . " All right , " said Colonel Min . " Let 's get this over with . " Lieutenant Cho once again went around the table and collected the cards and placed them before Colonel Min . Colonel Min looked them over and gave them back to Lieutenant Cho . Lieutenant Cho announced the result . The vote was five to two in favor of killing General Mah . I was on the point of getting up from my chair when Colonel Min said sharply , " Not one more word from you , Major Lee . Is that clear ? You 've had your chance as everyone else here . Sit down ! " There was nothing I could do . I had no choice but to sit down and  --  oh , you cold-blooded murderers ! Beasts ! Beasts ! We were all like beasts , like General Mah and his cohorts , like those we stood up against , in the name of justice and liberty and salvation  --  there was only one way to stop this cold , calculated , evil bloodshed ; I would call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There is one absentee vote I should like to put on record . GeneralYoon votes for killing General Mah . " I stared at Colonel Min . He stared back at me coldly . He spoke matter-of-factly , " As the chairman , it is my duty to remind you that this meeting has now reached a decision concerning General Mah . The majority decision dictates that we shall do all in our power , take all the necessary actions , to execute General Mah . It is also my duty to remind you that should there be any member of the Command Group and the subcommandgroups who ignores , disobeys , and sabotages the majority decision of this Command Group , I shall have him arrested and shot  --  including myself . Is that clearly understood ? " He was looking at me as he spoke . Cold eyes , cold bloodshot eyes . There was a knock on the door . Lieutenant Cho went out of the room and came back in instantly . " It is Colonel McKay , sir . I had him wait for you in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Colonel Min . " Gentlemen , this meeting is now adjourned . Thank you all . Now  --  go get some sleep , if you can sleep at all . " He turned to me . His face was impassive and his voice toneless . " Major Lee , I would like to see you when I am finished with Colonel McKay . Stay here . I sha n't be long . " The others were getting up from their chairs and quietly shuffling out of the room . Colonel Kim stopped to whisper to ColonelMin , then joined Colonel Park and went out of the room . LieutenantCho was hovering behind Colonel Min . Colonel Min said , " Lieutenant Cho , you may go . " Lieutenant Cho darted a quick look toward me and the chaplain , bowed slightly , and walked out . Colonel Min was filling his pipe with fresh tobacco . Chaplain Koh remained in his seat , looking down at his folded hands on the table . He did not look up . Colonel Min lighted his pipe , gazing at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which clouded his face for a moment . He leaned back against the chair . " Chaplain , " he said in a whisper . Chaplain Koh slowly raised his face and fixed his eyes on Colonel Min 's . The chaplain 's face looked old and weary , but his eyes were young and burning and defiant . " Yes , Colonel Min ? " Colonel Min 's gaze did not waver . Without a word , he nodded slightly . He sat up . " Chaplain , I want you to see Lieutenant Cho before you leave . Would you go over your plans once more with him ? He will take care of your transportation . " Chaplain Koh said , " Yes . " " Good luck in Seoul , Chaplain , " said Colonel Min . " We shall see each other again very soon . " He stood up . I did not stir . He came toward me . I did not look up . He stopped and stood behind me . I did not budge from my chair . " Will you wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stared at me . " You betrayed me , " I said . He was silent.  | " And you betrayed yourself , " I said . My voice shook with fury and shame . " Major Lee ! " Chaplain Koh said . " Hold your tongue and behave yourself ! " I heard behind me Colonel Min 's quick footsteps . " Not one more word from you , Chaplain ! " he spoke in whispers . " Not one more word ! " He was at his side . Chaplain Koh leaped to his feet . " Chaplain , good luck ! " said Colonel Min . " Take care of your-self . " Chaplain Koh nodded . They shook hands . Colonel Min stalked out of the room . I stood up . Chaplain Koh charged up to me . His face was angry . " I had to tell him , " I said . " I had to tell him what I thought of him , do n't you understand ? He 'd given me his word , do n't you see ? He 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I went on , " I had to try ! And I would try again and again and again ... " " Shut up ! That 's enough ! " " Yes . Yes . What 's the use of talking about it ! I did my best . " I stepped up to him and held his arm . " It was a lost cause , I know , but I thank you for your vote ! " He was shaking his head . " You are a fool , " he whispered . " I beg your pardon ! " Suddenly , his eyes were glistening with tears . " What is it ? What is it , Chaplain ! " He shook his arm out of my grip . " You are a fool , Major ! Do n't you see that ? " His voice slashed at me . I held my breath and stared at him . Before I could utter a word , his voice , now weary and weak , whispered , " And perhaps I , too , am a fool ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help muttering . " You  --  of all peo-ple ? " His voice was once again charged with savage fury . " Why ?  |p150Why  ! Because I am a chaplain ! Yes , yes ! I have two cheeks to offer . Two cheeks to be slapped twice ! And one life to be shot once ! And do you think the evil in the world will disappear with that ! " " But you said ... " " Ah ! That was my blasphemy , Major ! Forgive me , oh Lord , for I knew not what I was saying ! For we are not playing a nice , little , clean game by the heavenly rules of your book ! " With that outburst , he left me alone , shocked and confused , in the bare , empty , deserted room.  |p151Although  Colonel Min had orderedme to wait for him in the conferenceroom , I did not relish the thought of being alone in the barrenroom dimly illuminated by one shaded lamp from the ceiling . Theroom had no windows . The stale smoke from cigarettes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got up from my chair and walkedout of the room . But I had forgotten , momentarily , that ColonelMin and Colonel McKay were meeting in the adjoining general'soffice and that , in order to go outside the building , I would have towalk through the general 's office . Only when I closed the door of theconference room behind me and stood in the dark did I realize thatthey were both there , near the window that faced outside , sittingside by side on a couch . At first , I did not make out their figures ; then I saw the glow of Colonel Min 's pipe in the shadowy dark . Hestood up from the couch , his blurred figure framed by the window . It had become light outside though it was still dark gray and it wasraining . I could now see the raindrops streaming down the windowpanes . Colonel McKay , too , stood up from the couch . They bothremained quiet , standing side by side , against the gray , rainy dawnoutside the window . I had thought Colonel McKay was a tall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps an inch or two , than Colonel Min . " Major Lee , " said Colonel Min , " come and meet Colonel McKay . " I had been on the point of tiptoeing out of the room . I went up to them . " We 've met before , " said Colonel McKay , shaking my hand . " In Seoul . " " Yes , " I said . " I did n't think you would remember me . " Colonel Min said , " Oh , do n't worry . Colonel McKay rememberseverything . He has  --  what do you say ?  --  a photographic mem-ory . " " I depend on our computerized filing system , " said Colonel McKay , " if that 's what you mean . " He laughed . " I was discussing with Colonel McKay your trip to Japan , " said Colonel Min . " If all goes well , I would like you to be ready to leave tonight . " " Do you think the trip is really necessary ? " I said . " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Colonel McKay . " With your advice and cooperation , " said Colonel Min . I still could not make out Colonel McKay 's face ; a short , cropped haircut and a bushy moustache under his nose nearly hiding his mouth ; the rest of his face remained in the shadow . " If you both feel that the trip is absolutely essential , I am ready whenever you are , " I said . " Good , " said Colonel Min . " Fine , " said Colonel McKay . " Now , Major Lee , " said Colonel Min , " you will excuse us . I sha n't be long . " " I 'll be outside , " I said . " Good . Get some fresh air , " said Colonel Min . " See you tonight , then , " said Colonel McKay , " Major . " I walked out of the general 's office and into the aide 's room . LieutenantCho was there , sitting behind a desk . He stood up . " MajorLee. "  | " I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 've had your quarters ready , sir . The same ones you 've had before , behind the general 's mess . Your jeep 's outside . I had it brought over . " He handed me my raincoat . " This was in your jeep . Thought you would need it . It is going to rain all day . " I put the raincoat on . " What about tonight ? " " Rain , most likely , sir . That 's what our weather people said . " I nodded . " I am waiting for Colonel Min , " I said , moving toward the door . " I 'll be outside . " I changed my mind . " I am going over to the auditorium . Will you tell him I 'll be there ? " " Yes , sir . " I opened the door . A cool wind gushed in . I shivered . The rain was pouring down , flooding the field with eddying pools of muddy water . Streams of water flowed down the round , transparent cockpit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the heavy machineguns in the tanks ' turrets , and the anti-aircraft guns mounted on half-tracks had been draped with canvas covers . Heavy raindrops were splashing down near the tanks ' treads which had dug deep into the muddy earth . The sky was dirty gray . Lieutenant Cho was standing beside me . " You 'll be soaking wet , sir , " he said . " It 's all right . " I stepped out under the overhang . " Major Lee . " " Yes ? " " You will have breakfast with Colonel Min , wo n't you , sir ? " I looked at him  --  at the face of a gentle bulldog . " Yes . " He smiled . " I 'll have it sent over to Colonel Min 's quarters . " " All right . " I took a step out into the rain . " Sir ! " " Yes , Lieutenant ? " I did not turn around . His voice followed me . " Thank you , Major . " I nodded and headed for the auditorium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoroughly drenched from top to bottom ; my raincoatdid not do me any good . The muddy water was ankle-deep . The gray , rainy dawn had not yet fully dispelled the darknessp154within the auditorium . It was still shadowy and indistinct in there , but I could see rows and rows of steel folding chairs , the raised platform , the large movie screen on the wall behind the lectern . There was a table directly under the lectern down the center aisle , and ColonelMin 's phonograph was still on it . I walked down the aisle . It was a portable , stereo phonograph with built-in speakers which Colonel Min had brought back from Germany . The lid was down . I lifted it up . There was only one record on the turntable . I picked it up . Sibelius . I put the record back on the turntable . I started the phonograph . When it began to play , I stepped back toward the halfwaypoint up the aisle , took off my wet raincoat , sat down on a chair ; then the door creaked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Colonel Min . He came down the aisle toward me . He , too , was drenched with the rain . Water dripped from his cap . He took off his raincoat and cap and pulled out a chair in the middle of the aisle and sat down . He gave me a silent nod . " I hope you do n't mind my playing the record , " I said . " Do you like it ? " " It is too melancholy , too sad for my taste , " I said . As if he had not heard me , he whispered , " It is bitter music . Listen to the English horn ! Singing its own elegy , its own dirge ! " We did not speak after that , until the record was over and the phonograph turned itself off with a click . I watched him light his pipe . I waited till he had a few puffs . " I want to apologize  --  " He did not let me finish . " Enough , enough . " " You did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadowy face seemed to be brooding . " You did not betray yourself either , " I said . He remained silent . Awkward and uncomfortable , I was on the point of mentioning Colonel McKay to change the subject , when he looked at me fully and said , " I did not betray myself , did I ? " Then , speaking as though to himself alone , " No , I did not betray myself . " He turned to mep155again . " But not for you , do you understand ? Not for you alone ! For myself , for my sanity , for my salvation , do you understand that ? " I did not know what to say . " Ah  --  enough is enough 1 " he said . I nodded  --  rather mechanically , not fully comprehending his words . To my relief , he began telling me about his meeting with Colonel McKay . That the Americans had been pressuring the President to fire General Mah was true ; the President had at last given in to the pressure . Colonel McKay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assassination attempt on General Mah 's life had been staged by General Mah himself . I said , " And where does General Ahn come into the picture ? " He brooded on . " You are convinced that something is not quite right with GeneralAhn , " I said . " I know you believe that General Mah has something big on him , too . Do you think General Ahn has defected from us ? " He shook his head . " No . I do n't think we have to worry about that . Not yet , anyway . Colonel McKay feels the same way . " " Does Colonel McKay , then , have something on General Ahn ? " " Yes , but he would not tell me at this time . He is not certain of what he has on him . No , he would n't give it to me until he is absolutely sure of his information . After all , he is a general of your army with which we have a friendly relationship and are most eager to maintain that relationship , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are , at this stage , unable to confirm . ' That 's what he said . " " I must say it is strange logic he is using . He is quite willing to help us overthrow our government ! " A faint smile appeared on his face . " Colonel McKay finally confessed to me that the Americans have bugged General Ahn 's house . That , of course , is an admission that they have been suspectingp156him of something very serious . Needless to say , they have been bugging General Mah , too . " " Well , for that matter , I suppose they have bugged practically everyone in the country who is somebody . How about us ? " He laughed . " Not yet . But if our coup is successful and we are running the government , we will be . That 's his joke . " " If they have bugged General Ahn 's house , they must know the substance of the conversation between General Mah and General Ahn . " " They do . " " And he would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he gave me his word that he would give me the informationonce it is confirmed . For the time being , all he would tell me is that General Mah has threatened General Ahn that he knew enough about the coup plans which implicated General Ahn and has asked him to help him get in touch with the ringleaders  --  us , that is . And General Ahn has agreed to it . Colonel McKay guarantees that General Ahn has no intention of defecting from us at this time and that General Ahn does indeed want to kill General Mah , no matter what . Soon . At his first chance . " " I think it is very unreasonable of Colonel McKay to withhold any information , whether or not it is confirmed , when he is supposedlyhelping our cause . " " It does not really matter , " he said . " I am beginning to sense a certain pattern emerging from this situation involving General Ahn . " " Well ? " " I told Colonel McKay about the North Korean security colonel . Do you remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Well , to my surprise , Colonel McKay knew about that already . " " With the help of his computerized filing system ! " " Now , this is very serious , I think . When I mentioned this to him , he nearly jumped . You see , although he had known about thisp157North Korean colonel , he did n't know that I was somehow connected with it , that is , that I had known the North Korean officer years back . Of course , he thanked me for that piece of informa-tion . " " Well , what is he going to do with that ? " " That I would n't know . " " And what do you think it may all add up to ? " " I told you that I had seen this North Korean officer die before my own eyes . " " Yes . " " Well , General Ahn claimed that he had him shot . Either I am lying or he is . And I am not lying , of course . Naturally , there is always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I might have thought he was dead when actually he was n't . " " But did n't you also say that even if he had lived , the Communists would have shot him anyway ? He killed a Russian major , did n't he ? That 's what you said . " " That is true . That I saw happen . " " You were present ? " " Yes . " " In the Russian garrison in your town ? " " Yes . " " Was this North Korean officer  --  was he the one who had come from Pyungyang and arrested you ? " " Yes . You know that , do n't you ? Lieutenant Cho has told you ? " " Yes . You had come back to the town and settled out on your farm . " He nodded . " You had come back to the country from Manchuria with the Korean units which had been with the Chinese Communist troops . " " I think I told you that myself years ago . " " Yes . Now , those units @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its cadre . We know that . How did you leavep158them ? Were you demobilized ? Discharged ? Did you resign ? You came back to the country as one of their officers , after all . " " I simply left them and came home . " " And they would n't tolerate that . So they come looking for you , a deserter . Am I correct ? " " Yes . " " So this North Korean colonel  --  wait , he was a major , then . He comes to your town with his men and comes out to your farm . He arrests you and takes you into the Russian garrison . Did you know him before ? " " Yes . We were in the same unit in China and Manchuria . He had just been made a major in the new army . " " And what happened in the Russian garrison ? " " Are you interrogating me ? " Though his voice carried no sting of accusation , I checked myself . " No , no , of course not ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to piece things together . " He gazed at me . It had become a little lighter in the auditorium . I could now almost see the color of his eyes . " Piece things together for what ? To sketch in the rest of my past , my bloody past ? " His voice was calm and there was no hostility in the way he said his words ; it was , on the contrary , more like an amused grown-up gently chiding the impetuous curiosity of a child . He said , " Ah , never mind . It does not really matter now . " I went on , not without a certain degree of impudence , " Somethinghappened inside the Russian garrison . You are supposed to have killed the garrison commander  --  no , you did n't . You say the North Korean major did . How odd , though . However , you somehowmanaged to break out of the garrison and made it to Lieutenant Cho 's father 's house . There , his father and his brother helped you out of the house and presumably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smuggled you across the border into South Korea . Am I correct so far ? " " How odd , indeed . How odd , you say , that this North Korean security officer should kill the Russian major  --  "  | " You said you two were in the same unit . Were you friends ? " " Friends ? No . Battlefield comrades , perhaps , with the same dreams and hopes for the liberation of their country  --  until the dreams and hopes came true and then they began to dream and hope for different things , so different that one of them could not tolerate the other or live with him . " " He could not tolerate you ? " " So much so that he volunteered to come after me . Yes , he , too , was once a university student in Tokyo , a student of politics at Waseda University . He was two , three years older than I was , and he had joined the Korean Brigade several months before I did . He was tough , already battle-hardened when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but there was one thing common between us . An almost shameless love of our country  --  ah  --  that 's what we shared , do you understand ? If a Communist can be a patriot , a nationalistic patriot , then he was one . To this day , I do not really believe that he ever was a true Communist and Marxist with an international allegiance and loyalty . Korea  --  Korea ! That was all he could think of . His true loyalty and love were for his country and his people . " " Then  --  why ? Why would he set out to destroy you ? " " You see , he also wanted to be a good Communist , a true internationalCommunist whose allegiance and loyalty had to transcend the national boundaries and nationalistic consciousness of one 's ethnic loyalty , although little did he know then that the only choice they would give him after the war was either for him to be a good Communist with his unconditional , unquestioned loyalty to the Soviet Russia or to the Chinese Communists and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born out of time . Perhaps his case is not unique when we consider the nature of the Second World War and what happened after the war to various Communist movementsthat had originated during the war . In any event , therein lay what in the end became the seed of his tragedy . He did not know which way to turn and he had to destroy himself . " " You say he killed himself ? "  | " Perhaps it was not tragic after all . Perhaps it was more pathetic than anything else . Yes  --  so he came to arrest me . No , that is not true . He came to persuade me to return to Pyungyang and work with him . I had joined them during the war , when it did not matterwhat you were , what ideology you embraced . Did it matter ? We were all fighting against a common enemy and our common purpose then was to defeat this common enemy and liberate our country and return home . And that 's precisely what I did . When our common enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me and them to part company . I thought nothing of it . I did not even think about it , to tell you the truth . Perhaps I was naive ? But I had too much blood on my hands , do n't you see ? I had too many things I now wanted to forget . I had done many a horrible , horrifying thing in those few , short years . And  --  all that at my age , too ! I wanted nothing more than to come back to my hometown and settle on the farm near the graves of my parents , my poor parents for whom I had done nothing but bring suffering and misery and  --  well , the country was free now and there were more than enough people who wanted to run it . Let them , I said to myself , do you understand me ? Let them ! All I wanted was peace , a quiet peace and time , time to reflect on myself and on what I had done , time to turn back the clock , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I had grown up too quickly , too suddenly . I wanted the lost time back , back to myself and for myself . I craved peace and tranquillity and solitude for my life on the farm , far , far away from the hustle and bustle of crowds , soldiers and politicians , slogans and foreign ideologies , sensationalists and demagogues , true patriots and false prophets alike . I had heard them all . I had had enough of them all ! Farewell to all that ! I wanted to be a farmer . I wanted to be left alone and I would leave everyonealone . The world was full of people who wanted to do things for others , to others , who told you what was good for you and what was not good for you . Let them do what they wanted , but I wanted to be left alone . I had done my share of work , of sacrificep161for the country and for the people . Let me just be . So I went out to the farm . Then he came . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me alone , ' I said to him . Leave me alone . If you want power and glory , you can have them all . I do n't want any part of your grand design , grandiloquent dream . Leave me alone ! ' Persuasion became insinuation , insinuationbecame intimidation , intimidation became threat , and threat became torture . No , there was no meeting of minds . Look around you , ' I said , and see for yourself just where you stand and what you are . You are neither a good patriot , a good nationalist , a lover of one 's country , nor are you a good Communist . Look at yourself , ' I said , what has become of you ? An instrument , a weapon , of those false prophets and false patriots , foreign lackeys , who are once more enslaving the people , who are corrupted by their own power , who are bent on setting up a totalitarian , dictatorial society in the name of justice , equality , and liberty . What has happened to your dreams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to the Russian garrison . " We were to stay there overnight , then go on to Pyungyang the next morning . I shall never know why he decided to stay there for the night rather than go directly to Pyungyang the same day . After all , we were only a two hours ' drive away from Pyungyang . It seemed he had known the Russian major , the garrison commander , personally . At any rate , it was still early in the afternoon when we drove into the Russian garrison . The garrison was then in a large apple orchard which had belonged to a Japanese . Needless to say , the Japanese was the wealthiest man in our town . He owned not only the orchard but a few rice plantations , as well as stores and a restaurant and a whorehouse . He had built a mansion in the middle of his orchard , and rows of tenant houses for the Korean laborerswere about a mile or so from the mansion . The Russian commander and his staff were living in the mansion and their men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the underground warehouses . I stayed there in a dark , damp cell of the warehouse all afternoon , in one of the many concrete cells wherep162the Japanese used to store his choicest apples , which , as rumors would have it , were later wrapped in special papers embossed with chrysanthemums and shipped to Japan for use in the Imperial household . It was late in the fall and it was cold in there . Then the night came  --  not that I could tell the time  --  and a Russian soldier came and dragged me out . The warehouse must have been nearly two miles from the mansion . The Russian soldier , who I now saw was a lieutenant , drove me in a jeep to the mansion . He took me in and led me downstairs to the basement . There I found myself face to face with the Russian major and the North Korean major , my former comrade in arms and now my captor . The Russian lieutenantlocked the door of the basement and stayed there with them . " " Interrogation ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know ? I remember there was a party going on within the mansion , upstairs ; when I was pushed into the mansion , I heard singing and shouting and a phonograph going on very loud somewhere upstairs . The officers were all there , I thought . Yes  --  I remember the phonograph was blasting out some old Japanesewar songs and the Russians were bellowing out , imitating the songs , laughing and roaring , and I remember hearing glasses breakingand footsteps bouncing overhead . But , downstairs in the basement , behind its locked door , we were all quiet . The Russian major was short and fat ; his head was shaven smooth and his big , blue eyes were darting from me to the North Korean major , back and forth , back and forth ; I do n't remember his face too clearly now , but it was a small face , somewhat out of proportion to his thick , stubby figure . The Russian lieutenant was big and large , his head also shaven and I remember how big and strong his hands were when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major said something to the lieutenant and the big man pushed me forward to the center of the room and , with one big hand , pressed me down on my knees . I saw their boots ; the three of them wore black boots and I saw six boots before my eyes and they squeaked and squished . I tried to raise my head and the lieutenant pushed it down . TheP163Russian major was speaking to the North Korean major , though I could not tell what he was saying . Then a pair of boots moved away  --  the lieutenant  --  and the next thing I knew , he began whipping me . I was whipped exactly nine times , on my back . I did not cry out , I did not budge , I did not even stir . The whipping stopped and the lieutenant pulled my hair , yanking my head up and back , so that I could see the Russian major and the North Korean major full in their faces . I remember the big , blue eyes of the Russian , expressionless , peering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes were flaming and full of hatred . He hated me , understand ? He was hating me with all his might . Such hate ! Such vicious , violent , horrifying hate ! And I said to him , Why do you do this to me ? Why do you let them do this to me ? ' He spat in my face . The Russian major wanted to know what I said , I think . The North Korean major was shaking his head , furiously saying something in Russian . And the Russian major took out his revolverfrom the holster and handed it to the North Korean major , who had his own revolver strapped to his waist . He did not take the revolver and was shaking his head , staring , staring at me . Your master wants you to kill me , ' I said to him . Why do n't you kill me ? ' Shut your filthy mouth ! ' he screamed . The Russian major wanted to know what I said . His stubby fingers snapped , as if to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ' And the Russian major hissed to the lieutenant  --  perhaps , to begin whipping me again . And the North Korean 's boots stomped on the concrete floor and leaped over to the lieutenant . He snatched the whip , a long whip , from the lieutenant . I saw the tail of the whip slither on the floor after him . He said something in Russian to the two of them . The Russian major shrugged his shoulders and backed off a few paces and sat down on a chair . The lieutenant stood beside the major . Then the North Korean major started whipping me . He did not say a word . He was simply hissing with his violent breathing . He whipped and whipped , on my back , on my shoulders , on my arms , and  --  and on my face and that was enough for me and I couldn'tp164take it any longer , I could n't bear the humiliation any longer . Mind you , it was not the physical pain , not the bleeding pain that forced me to stand up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take it any longer , this insult and humiliation , this beastly humiliation ! I stumbled on my knees and I staggered up . I collapsed . He whipped me hard across my chest and the tail of his whip slashed into my face , into my eyes , and I knew my face was bleeding , my eyes were bleeding , and I was screaming , What have I done to you ! What have I done to you ! What harm have I done to you ! You hate me ! Why do you hate me ! What have I done to you ! I have done nothing to harm you , to hurt you , to destroy you and your cause ! What have I done to you ! ' He whipped and whipped me . What hate , what vicious , violent hate ! What sadistic hate ! And then  --  in one blinding , bleeding , aching moment , it flashed across my seething , boiling , burning mind that , that perhaps , perhaps , whipingme in his sadistic , demoniac hate and fury , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he himself that was being whipped . But all this is perhaps my afterthought , looking back on it as I am now . Who knows ? All I know is that , the next moment , I raised myself fully , spreading my arms , while his whip kept on lashing me , and I caught the tail of his whip and I hung onto it and pulled it with all my might in all my blinding rage and the whip came flying at me , coiling up in the air garishly lighted with red and blue lamps . The whip had jerked out of his hand and now it was in my hand and I began whipping him , half mad , screaming and screaming  --  ' What have I done to you ! ' I whipped and whipped him , not thinkingfor one moment that the Russians were there , not thinking that they could shoot me dead . The North Korean major raised his arms , and his elbows were bent , his hands covering his face , and the whip slashed and slashed at him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and whipped him to the wall near where the two Russians were . And it was then that I realized I was the one whipping , and I staggered on my feet , vaguely aware that the whip now rested , coiled , beside my feet , and the North Korean major loweredp165his arms and looked at me and around him with his bloodshot , dazed eyes , and it was then that we , both of us , saw that the Russians , the Russian major , the garrison commander , and the big lieutenant  --  they were laughing and laughing and laughing . Their roaring laughter bounced and danced in the room , echoing and echoing , shaking the room , so it seemed to me , and , suddenly , I thought I could hear the roaring laughter and the old Japanese war songs and the tinkling and shattering of glasses upstairs and I felt my body freeze up for a second , then  --  then , I looked at the North Korean major , looked at his bloody face , bleeding face , looked into his bleeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face , my bleeding face , looked into my bleeding eyes , and I was standing there still clutching the whip and the Russians were looking at us laughing and laughing and laughing . Suddenly the North Korean major flung himself at the Russian major , his body nearly flying in the air , his arms outstretched , his bloody hands and fingers outstretched and spread wide . The chair the Russian major was sitting on fell crashingonto the floor and both of them tumbled down , together , the North Korean major on top of the Russian major , and I saw his hands were around the other 's neck , the open neck that the Russian 's unbuttoned jacket had bared . I felt as though the room was whirlingaround and around and I felt dizzy and sick ; then I saw the Russian lieutenant , who was suddenly jerking up as though wakingfrom a bad dream , mumbling and stuttering . Then I saw him reach for his revolver and I slashed at him with the whip and he charged at me , and I whipped him hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gun out of the holster and I whipped him and whipped him and the gun went flying from his hand and bouncing on the floor . I whipped and whipped him and saw him doubling up , his big hairy hands covering his face and I ran after the gun and he came after the gun , too , and I whipped him again and again and he was roaring like a beast , getting up from the floor , raising his arms over his head , and he grabbed the hissing tail of the whip and I let it go before he could snatch it from my hands and he fellP166backward on the floor , his black boots scraping against the concrete floor . Then I had the revolver in my hand and I instinctively clicked the bullet chamber around twice , cocking the hammer at the same time and when the big beast , now half standing , on his knees , raised the whip ready to lash at me , I shot him . I shot him twice . " He was dead instantly . I knew he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The memories and experiences of the battles all came rushing back to me . My face was bleeding and sweating and I was breathing hard but I was now calm and strangely composed . I was standing firm and quiet . It was as though a great tide of anger and battle had washed me clean and left me peaceful . I went over to the others . The Russian major was dead , strangled to death . He was sprawled flat on the floor , his arms stretched out , and his face now seemed to have shrunk into the open neck of his jacket . The North Korean major was sitting next to him , his knees drawn up , his arms dangling limp at his side . He looked up . I stood before him . He looked up at me , squinting his bloody eyes . One of his eyes was swollen , bleeding . He staggered up to his feet . I still had the Russian'srevolver in my hand . His was in the holster . We stared at each other for a moment . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the holster . We were still staring at each other . He slowly turned his head and looked at the body of the Russian major . He looked back at me . Then he looked at the body again . We did n't have to speak . I knew what he was thinking . He raised his revolverand shot the Russian major 's body , once , in the neck . Then we left . Still we did not speak . Not one word , do you understand ? We unlocked the door and stepped out of the basement . There was no one in sight . There was no sound , no noise from upstairs . It was very quiet and hushed . We did n't run . We simply walked across the large hallway and out of the mansion . Still not one word had passed between us . The jeep was still there outside . We got in . He drove . We drove in silence down the graveled driveway which was about half a mile long to the entrance of the garrison . There were two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't have to speak . We knew what we had to do . He slowed the jeep downp167as the two guards came out of the sentry box ; he stopped the jeep when they came close enough and shouted something in Russian and the guards , one on each side of the jeep , raised their hands as if to salute , then we shot them . He jumped out of the jeep , picked up the German submachine gun the Russian guard on his side had dropped on the ground , leaped back into the jeep and handed me the submachine gun . Then we drove out of the gate . He did not know our town and I had to direct him . About two miles from the garrison , I had him drive off the main road and onto a dirt road that was a shortcut to where Lieutenant Cho 's family lived . I did n't really know why I directed him toward that way , except that the dirt road went along the side of a mountain and , in case we were followed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mountain . The mountain road went winding for three or four miles and came out behind the town . There he stopped . We could look down on the town , quiet and dark . It must have been after midnight . The moon was up , half hidden in black clouds , cold and silent . He turned off the engine and looked at me fully , then he began crying . He wept without sound , leaning his head back against the seat , letting his tears bathe his face , as though abandoning himself to the whirlpool of his tangled emotions . I spoke to him for the first time . What will you do now ? ' He did not respond to my words . I said , I 'm going to try to cross the border to the South . Will you come with me ? ' He sat up slowly and looked at me . He nodded , without a word . Wait here , ' I said . I know someone who will help us find people who can get us across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' I 'll wait for you here , ' he said . His voice was calm . All right , ' I said . I got out of the jeep and started down the hill , at the foot of which was Lieutenant Cho 's father 's house . Halfway down the hill , it struck me that I still had the German submachine gun in my hand . I thought of hiding it there and picking it up on my way back . But I did n't let it go and carried it all the way down the hill . Lieutenant Cho 's father and his brother came out with me . I told them what happened as we climbed up the hill . We 've got to get you across the border , ' said Lieutenant Cho 's father . Yes , '  |p168I  said . Can you help me ? ' Without replying to me , he turned to his son and told him to run back to the house and come back with some money , clothes , and food . The boy ran down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had left the North Korean major . " A few more steps and we would be on the dirt road , and I held Lieutenant Cho 's father back . I wanted to be sure . We could see the jeep , shadowy in the moonlight , and I whispered , Chung ! Chung ! ' That was his name  --  Major Chung , Comrade Chung ! He did not respond . There was no sound . We waited for a few moments and I called again . Not a sound came from the jeep . I told Lieutenant Cho 's father to wait for me there . I checked the submachine gun , loaded it , and crawled up the remaining few paces . I had to be sure . I lay flat on the dirt , pressing my ears to the ground . I could not hear a sound except the pounding of my own heart . I got up and went over to the jeep , a step at a time , the submachine gun at ready . I approached the jeep from behind , then I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jeep , whispering , Chung ! Major Chung ! ' I found him  --  his body  --  halfway out of the jeep on his side , his left shoulder leaning against the back of his seat . He was dead  --  or so I thought . The moonlight was bright enough in the jeep and I saw that his face was covered with dark blood , then I smelled the pungent odor of gunpowder and I looked for his gun . I found it on the floor at the foot of the other seat . I knew he had shot himself but I had to be sure . With the submachinegun in my right hand and his revolver in the other hand , I laid myself flat on the dirt in the shadow of the jeep , listening for sound , and checked his revolver . The barrel was still warm and the bullet chamber showed two empty holes . Yes  --  he had shot himself . I was now sure of that . " There was no time to lose . I threw the revolver away down the hill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cho 's father to come up . Then , instinctively , I suppose , I searched for Major Chung 's wallet and found it in a pocket inside his jacket . I wanted his papers , you see ? I took his papers and whatever money there was in the wallet and threw away the rest of the contents , stillp169in the wallet . Lieutenant Cho 's father came up , with his son beside him , and they both stood next to me without a word . He 's dead , ' I said . He killed himself . ' The boy  --  I think he was about sixteen  --  he just stood there , looking at the body . His father said to me , Come ! Let 's get away quickly ! ' He sent his son back to the house . The boy gave me a bow and quietly walked down the hill . That was the last time I saw him . You know  --  he was shot to death only two months later in Pyungyang during a student demonstrationagainst the Communists . " The boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right there , then we started on our way . I never had to use Major Chung 's papers . Lieutenant Cho 's father knew the border smugglers ' route , you might say their underground organization . Before long he had me in the hands of my first contact , a farmer , who handed me over to a local fishmonger . Then I parted with Lieutenant Cho 's father . The fishmonger had an old truck and he put me in a fish barrel and drove me to a fishing village about ten miles or so from our town . We got to the village before the sunrise and I was hidden in a cave on a cliff on the beach . When the night came at last , a boy of about fifteen appeared and led me down the cliff to a waiting boat . Two men rowed me out ; I ca n't remember how far they rowed out , but we rendezvoused with what looked to me like a torpedo boat . Soon we were out in the open sea , heading for another rendezvous with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or more escapees like me on board . It was a South Korean ship and I learned that she was manned and operated by the members of the Northwest Youth Association , you know , the organization of anti-Communist North Korean refugees in the South . The ship picked up more refugees on the way to the South and at dawn we were at the other side of the thirty-eighth parallel . I had escaped from the North ; I had left my hometown ; and my exile had just begun . " He sat brooding , his dark face lowered , his arms crossed over his chest . " I am sorry , " I said .   " Sorry for what ? " he said quietly without looking up . " I am sorry I thought you 'd killed the Russian major , " I said , " and I am sorry , too , that you had to go through all that ! " " Now you know that I did n't kill the Russian major , " he said . His voice was cold and steady . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian lieutenant . " " I did n't mean it to sound that way , " I said . " Please ! " " Does it make any difference to you whom I killed ? " I did not know what to say . " Are you relieved that I killed the Russian lieutenant instead of the Russian major ? " " I wish you did n't speak that way to me ! " He closed his eyes . " Sorry , " he whispered . " I am glad you told me about the circumstances , " I said , " because now I know that , well , you know , you did n't have any other choice . " " Are you exonerating me from being a cold-blooded murderer , " he said with a sharp bitterness in his voice , " now that you know I had no other choice ? " I stared at him , not knowing what to say . " If there had been other choices , " he assaulted me relentlessly , " would you have judged me a cold-blooded murderer ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! That 's enough ! We'vesaid enough ! " " Yes , we 've said enough ! " He stood up from his chair . He looked weary . " Come ! Let 's go . " I got up and followed him up the aisle . Suddenly , he stopped and turned around to me . " Listen ! Listen to me ! " he shouted in fury . His face was flushed with fierce anger , , and his voice  --  at once defiant and pleading  --  burst out , " You  --  all you do-gooders , the noble-minded , the pure , the innocent  --  you  --  you  --  do you know with what anguish , with what agony , with what nightmarish human horror I have to say I did not have a choice ? "  | " Please ! Please ! " " Do n't you understand ? Do n't you know ? " " Please ! " And  --  as suddenly as his anger had exploded  --  he looked into my eyes with a somber , brooding , dark calm , and his voice whispered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a saint , nor an angel , nor a god , do n't you know ? I had no other choice , you see , because I am a mortal man . "  |p172In  spite of the weather report that the rainwould continue throughout the night , it began lifting shortly after four in the afternoon . By seven , when we were preparing ourselves to leave for our rendezvous with GeneralMah , the rain stopped . The sky began to clear up . The air becamehumid and warm . Thick fog began rising from the earth . We had gone over our plans with the members of the Command Group , especially with Colonel Kim who had been in constant contactnot only with Colonel Son in Seoul but with every single source of intelligence that was available to him . It was our good fortune to have Colonel Son where he was  --  in the heart of General Mah 's headquarters as his deputy . We had learned that Colonel Son had been instructed by General Mah to take charge of the details of the rendezvous , which General Mah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Another piece of luck for us was that General Mah had also instructed Colonel Son to place General Ahn under surveillance , although General Mah had not yet confided in Colonel Son about his secret meeting with General Ahn . When we met later once more for the final briefing , Colonel Kim said with a triumphant grin , " So  --  you see , we are now in a posi/tion not only of telling General Mah what to do and what to expect for the rendezvous but also of keeping an eye on General Ahn 's everymovement . General Mah wanted Colonel Son to tell General Ahn to be present at the rendezvous . Colonel Son is to give the details of the rendezvous to General Ahn at the last minute . And , Colonel Min , thanks to you , General Mah has been kept busy and incommunicado all day . " " Thanks to Colonel McKay , you mean , " said Colonel Min . GeneralMah had been requested to appear for a series of private conferencesand briefings with American Intelligence people . He had to leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He could n't afford to turn down the American request , " said Colonel Min . " Not at this time when his career and life may depend on winning back the Americans ' good grace  --  from his point of view , that is . " " Colonel Son has reported to General Mah that he has been able to trace General Ahn to General Ham 's headquarters . As far as GeneralMah is concerned , General Ahn flew out to see General Ham and flew back to Seoul . Colonel Son is certain that there has been no communication between General Ahn and General Mah since GeneralAhn returned to Seoul from here , " said Colonel Kim . " Colonel Son will tell General Mah that as a result of his communication with General Ham there is to be a last-minute change of location for the rendezvous . As you suggested , Colonel Min , we changed it to an emergency airstrip about twelve miles from the village which as you know , gentlemen , was the original location proposed by General Mah . " Colonel Moon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to be allowed to bring out his Commandos ? " Colonel Kim said , " Colonel Park has taken care of that . " Colonel Park said , " This is the way it will be operated . Colonel Son is keeping an eye on General Ahn 's movements . We have our people with General Ahn 's Commando Groups and we will find out , when Colonel Son tells him to appear at the rendezvous , what Gen/eral Ahn is going to do . Most likely , he will alert his Commandos and try to sneak them out of Seoul  --  some of them anyway . As soon as Colonel Son gets that information , he will contact LieutenantColonel Hwang of the Airborne , who had orders from me to interceptGeneral Ahn 's Commandos  --  in the name of General Mah , if you know what I mean . Colonel Son will see to that . So  --  Colonel Hwang will have no problem getting his Paratroopers out of Seoul . It will be done all properly and with authorization from General Mah himself . " Colonel Song said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intercept the Commandos ? I mean , what if the Commandos do actuallyappear at the rendezvous ? We might have a bloody mess on our hands . " Colonel Kim said , " Ah ! You worry too much , Colonel Song . That has been also taken care of . You tell him , Colonel Park . " Colonel Park said , " As you know , Colonel Son will be giving General Ahn the details of the rendezvous at the last minute , but he will not tell General Ahn that the location has been changed . GeneralAhn and his Commandos will proceed to the village , where Colonel Hwang 's Paratroopers will intercept them . By interception , I mean that Colonel Hwang will tell General Ahn that he is to proceedto the airstrip , alone , and send the Commandos back to Seoul . This part of the operation , by the way , will be done in the name of this Command Group . " " If General Ahn refuses ? " said Colonel Moon . " If he refuses to obey our orders ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take care of the Commandos . Since the Paratroopers will be operating under General Mah 's orders , thanks to Colonel Son , they will be properly armed . If it comes to that , the Paratroopers will have everything they need to knock out General Ahn 's Commandos . " Colonel Song cluck-clucked , shaking his head . " Ca n't be helped if it comes to that , " said Colonel Kim . " I think General Ahn will be smart enough not to risk everything there , " said Colonel Min . " I am counting on his cleverness . "   " Another part of this operation , " said Colonel Park , " is to secure the airstrip with our men . And that will be taken care of by Colonel Jung of the Presidential Brigade . Colonel Son has been in touch with Colonel Jung . An amusing aspect of this is that this will be also carried out by orders of General li Iah . General Mah has instructedColonel Son to secretly deploy men from the Presidential Brigade around the village . Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his armored units deployed at the air-strip . " " Thank you for all that trouble , " said Colonel Min with a faint smile , " to make sure that we come back alive . " " I still do n't like your going there , " said Colonel Song . " Anythingcan go wrong . " " General Yoon was furious , " said Colonel Moon . " He wants to go there himself . Understandable , of course . " " The matter has been settled , " said Colonel Min . " You will be going in two jeeps , " said Colonel Kim . " I am assigningfive of my special agents to you , so do n't object . Besides , it would look better , you know , as though we were all there with you . " Colonel Min nodded . " You , Major Lee , and Lieutenant Cho will ride with one of the agents in the forward jeep , and the other four agents will be behind you . They will be well armed . The four of them behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine gun mounted on it . In addition , they will be carrying rocket launchers and grenades . I put a box of grenades in your jeep , Lieutenant Cho . Remember that . " " Yes , sir , " said Lieutenant Cho . " What kind are they , Colonel ? " " Not fragmentation type . They are anti-tank grenades . I put a rifle with the attachment there , too . You know how to use it ? " " Of course , sir . " " Are you expecting tanks ? " said Colonel Song , frowning . " It sounds as though you expect them to have a real combat ! " " I am simply expecting the worst , " said Colonel Kim . " We aren'tp176playing a game , you know . As you said , anything can go wrong . Seriously , I am not expecting that General Mah will come riding in in a tank , but I am expecting that he might come in one of his sedans and you know they are armor-plated . I guess you could call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more dirty tricks than you can count . Naturally , I hope they wo n't have to go through the trouble of using anything they are going to take with them . Incidentally , Colonel Min , I want you all to carry a couple of hand grenades . You 'll see to that , Lieutenant Cho . I 'd better give you a couple of submachine guns , too , come to think of it . " " Do we really need all those ? " said Colonel Min . Colonel Kim said , " By all means . You never know . Just take them . You will make us feel better here . " " All right , if you insist , " said Colonel Min . " Anything else ? " Colonel Park said , " You will arrive at the airstrip by 2230 , at the latest . The rendezvous is to take place at 2300 sharp . You know that . Colonel Jung will have completed deploying his men at the airstrip by 2200 . Colonel Son is to go ahead of General Mah and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you arrive . You will enter the airstrip from the eastern end of it and when you enter , you will stop , turn off all the lights , then exactly ten seconds later , turn the lights on . Repeat this twice . Colonel Son , if he is already there , and if he is n't , then Colonel Jung , will follow the same procedure , after you finish . Then you will proceed to the center of the airstrip on the northern side , which will be on your right as you go . Colonel Son , or Colonel Jung , will take care of the rest from that point on . Any questions ? " Colonel Min said , " Are we sure that this emergency airstrip is not in use at the moment ? " " I 've checked it out . It is not in use , " said Colonel Park . " What if someone in emergency wants to land ? " said Colonel Moon . " I am glad you brought it up , Colonel Min , " said Colonel Park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is my solution whichp177I think serves two purposes . I am having an L-17 fly over the airstrip just about the time you will be arriving . It will buzz the airstrip once and leave you for the time being . It will then continue to fly over you in a circle , more or less , sending any light aircraft in emergency away from the area and , at the same time , keeping an eye on any unusual night traffic toward the airstrip . It will naturally warn you if it spots any heavy traffic heading for the airstrip ; that is , General Mah might , just might do something unpredictable . For all we know , he might mobilize the entire PresidentialBrigade . " " How would the L-17 warn us in such an event ? " said Colonel Min . " By radio ? " " I ruled out the use of radio communication . It will buzz you . Twice . Remember . Twice . It will then go , and radio us . It looks better that way ; it might pass for someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you are on your own after that . " " All right , " said Colonel Min . " Anything else ? " " That is all from me , " said Colonel Park . " Same here , " said Colonel Kim , " except to wish you all good luck . " Colonel Min looked at each one of us . " In that case , I have somethingrather important to report and to ask for your advice and cooperation . But , first , would anyone like some tea or coffee ? I would like some tea . Will you join me ? " We had been sitting in Colonel Min 's quarters . Colonel Min sat on his cot between Colonel Park and Colonel Kim . Colonel Song sat on a chair at Colonel Min 's desk ; Colonel Moon and I sat on a low wooden bench against the wall ; Lieutenant Cho was sitting on the floor , in the center of which Colonel Park had spread a large sketch of the airstrip and its surroundings , including the network of roads . Lieutenant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The tin-roofed hut had two small rooms ; Colonel Min used the other room as his office rather than the one adjoining the general 's office . The room we were in had only one window . The sky was gettingp178dark outside . It was dark inside the room , too , but no one had bothered to turn on the lamp on the table . Lieutenant Cho returned with a pot of tea , a teakettle with hot water , a jar of American instantcoffee , sugar , spoons , cups , and a can of evaporated milk . It was as if he had them all neatly placed on a tray , which he now carriedinto the room at a cue from Colonel Min . Lieutenant Cho 's big , stubby hands began serving us tea and coffee . I took tea . " Well , well , " said Colonel Song , clearing his throat . " This is a surprise ! " The others were quiet . " This could n't be a farewell party ? " said Colonel Kim , laughing . " Ah , nonsense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what to say . Colonel Park said , " Well , now , let 's hear it . " He bent over and picked up the sketch of the airstrip from the floor . The paper crackledas he folded it and put it in his breast pocket . " I saw General Hyun just before we met here , " said Colonel Min . " And Colonel McKay was with me when I saw the general . I had already seen the general in the morning as you know and I had made my report on General Mah . Gentlemen , I am going to exercise my prerogative as the chairman of the Command Group , with the adviceand consent of General Hyun and upon recommendation of Colonel McKay , and ask you to reconsider our decision on General Mah . " No one spoke for a while . At last , Colonel Park said , " Colonel McKay had been to see General Hyun ? " Colonel Min nodded . " Yes . " " And Colonel McKay told him that it was a bad policy to kill General Mali @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " And he agrees with Colonel McKay ? " " Yes . " " And , now , do you agree with them ? "  |p179Colonel  Min did not reply immediately . He took time to look at each of us in the shadowy darkness . He said , " Yes . " " I see , " said Colonel Park . " In that case , let 's hear your alter-native . " " Keep General Mah alive , " said Colonel Min , " and bring him here . He can afford to disappear from Seoul for a few days , especially after the assassination attempt on his life . " " Bring him here , " said Colonel Kim . " Then what ? " Colonel Min said , " Keep him here until our coup is over . " Colonel Song said , " Does this mean that we no longer consider him to be our major threat ? " " He still is , " said Colonel Kim . " I do n't like this . " " This alternative  --  is it based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deal with us or defect to us and that we accept him ? " said Colonel Moon . " The alternate plan is not based on any assumption , " said Colonel Min . " It simply recognizes the fact that , in view of the situation and of our own strength as you have just been briefed on by ColonelKim and Colonel Park , there is no compelling need to execute General Mah at this stage of our plans . It is also in recognition of Colonel McKay 's wish and advice that our execution of General Mah at this time will not be viewed favorably by the Americans , particularly by their State Department . Colonel McKay cited what he called a melancholy precedent in Viet Nam , if you know what I mean . And I do n't have to remind you all that , for the time being , we need the assistance of Colonel McKay 's people . And , also , the general 's wish is involved here . " " What I want to know is what your wish is , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you personally feel about this , " said Colonel Song . " All right . Consider our plans for our rendezvous with General Mah , " said Colonel Min . " We have trapped General Mah , we will shortly , that is . This is our first test of our real strength , gentlemen , and what we can see for ourselves is quite reassuring . Inp180short , General Mah as a major , prime threat to our cause does not exist any longer . I think both the general and Colonel McKay are not asking us to alter an irrevocable course of action . We can now afford to accommodate their wishes . I propose , therefore , that we proceed in this order . First , our primary objective shall be to persuade , by force or otherwise , General Mah to come with us , whether there is a deal to be made or not . In short , we shall kidnap him . If this plan succeeds as I think it will , we shall have Colonel Son , who will take full charge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrest if necessary those on our list who are in commandpositions in and near Seoul , those who are not desirable from our point of view . Colonel Son will have an excellent , ready-made excuse for it : that is , General Mah has been gunned down and nearly killed and has now disappeared ; it will be his duty to open an investigation , a quiet inquiry if you like . No one will stop him . Second , if the first plan does not work , then we shall proceed in accordance with our original plan . Any opinions ? " " Would you like to put this to a vote ? " said Colonel Park . " If you all want to , " said Colonel Min . I wanted to say something , but I did not know what . I merely watched the shadowy , dark face of Colonel Min who sat on the cot , immobile , impassive , and  --  inscrutable . " Well , I do n't think we have to vote on this , " said Colonel Park . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " For you , Colonel Min , " said Colonel Kim , shaking his head , " I will shut up just this once . " Colonel Song and Colonel Moon both nodded . " And you ? Major Lee ? " said Colonel Park . " You must be happy about this , Major , " said Colonel Kim . " Now , now , " said Colonel Song . I wanted to say something meaningful , something appropriate ; I wanted to say something desperately . But I only managed to blurt out , " I must thank you all . " Colonel Park 's sharp words cut into me . " Thank Colonel Min ! "  | " All right , " said Colonel Min , standing up . " I want to thank you all , and I assure you we wo n't fail you . " Colonel Kim said , " Let 's synchronize our watches . " We did and all stood up . Lieutenant Cho collected the cups and saucers . Everyone filed out of the room . Colonel Min walked past me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lieutenant Cho whispered to me , " We 'll be all right , sir . Do n't worry about a thing . " I stepped out of the room into the dark outside . We all shook hands silently . Colonel Park came up to me . " Sorry , " he said and tapped me on the shoulder . " Good luck . " " All right , " said Colonel Min to everyone . " Let 's get this over with . " " Lieutenant Cho , do n't forget to pick up the submachine guns , " said Colonel Kim . " I 'll give the word to my agents . "  |p182Twenty  minutes past ten o'clock . In another five minutes , we wouldget off the main road and onto a dirt road going north , when the jeep behind us blew its horn three times , flashing its headlights on and off . The special agent who had been riding with us , sitting in the back with me , said to Lieutenant Cho at the wheel , " Slow down , Lieutenant . They want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Lieutenant Cho . " Just a routine precaution , sir , " said the agent . " We 'll let them go ahead of us . " The jeep passed us at a high speed I had never thought a jeep was capable of doing ; none of the four agents even looked in our direction . Lieutenant Cho accelerated our jeep . It jerked over a bump on the road . The submachine guns at our feet clanged against each other . " Almost there , sir , " said the agent to Colonel Min , who checked his watch and nodded . We drove off the main road and turned to the right . The jeep ahead of us had now slowed down . The land was flat on both sides , but ahead of us I could see the dark hills rising . The fog becamep183thicker . The dirt road was muddy and bumpy . I saw the taillights of the forward jeep dimly through the fog as they bounced up and down , intermittently illuminated by the headlights of our jeep which also bounced on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leaning slightly forward as he peered out through the windshield . " I think they want to stop . " The dirt road turned to the left , to the west ; the forward jeep stopped ; an agent was getting out of the jeep . Lieutenant Cho slowed down and brought the jeep to a halt a few yards behind the other jeep . " What is it now ? " said Lieutenant Cho , racing the engine in idle . " He will explain it , sir , " said the agent . " May I get out ? " Lieutenant Cho got out of the jeep . The agent bent over and leapedout as Lieutenant Cho held his seat up for him . The senior agent came to Colonel Min 's side . " We are going to wait here , Colonel , until we sight the L-17 . " " All right , " said Colonel Min , checking his watch again . " It should be here any minute . " " Yes , sir , " said the agent . " Would you mind stepping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir ? I want my men to put the top down and also the windshield . " " Go ahead , " said Colonel Min . " Lieutenant Cho , give them a hand , will you ? " We got out of the jeep . The agents began working on the jeeps . The windshield was down and the top folded down . Two agents were mounting the .50-caliber machine gun on the forward jeep . The agent who had been riding with us was checking the rocket launcher on our jeep . He spoke to the senior agent . " Do you want me to load this thing ? " " Yes . " The two agents in the other jeep finished mounting the heavy machine gun and were checking it , tapping on it , and swiveling it around . Then they fed it with a cartridge belt ; the long , sleek bulletsgleamed in the dimmed headlights . The senior agent lookedp184over the rocket launcher on our jeep and checked the submachine guns . He called to the agents on the other jeep . " Bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An agent brought a boxful of them ; we each took two grenades ; we put them into the side pockets of our fatigue trousers . " Anything else ? " said Colonel Min . " Yes , sir , " said the senior agent . " I hope we wo n't have to use all these , but if you decide we are going to have to shoot it out , we 'll be ready . The only thing I want to make sure of , sir , is who is going to give the firing order . " Colonel Min said , " Major Lee will do it . " " Why me ? " I did not mean to protest but I was taken by surprise . Colonel Min said , " I want you to ride in the other jeep . " " Why ? " " When General Mah appears , I will see him alone . I want to see him alone . Remember this , all of you . " The other agents had gatheredaround us . " When I talk with General Mah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want the jeeps standing twenty paces apart from one another and have them placed so that the headlights will cross each other , is that clear ? In case we have to shoot it out , you will give a cross fire , understood ? I do n't think it will happen but if it does , and if I want you to start firing , I 'll clasp my hands behind my back . Give me three seconds before firing . Three seconds after my hands are clasped behind my back  --  and you should be able to see me doing that  --  I will drop down on the ground and you will start firing . Any questions ? " The senior agent said , " I 'll count on Major Lee to give me the firing order , then . " He turned to an agent who stood next to him . " You take charge of this jeep and I want you to keep an eye on me . When Major Lee gives me the firing order I 'll drop my arm and you can give them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sure . " We heard the sounds of a plane . We looked up at the sky . Though the moon was hidden by black rain clouds , stars were out.  |p185We  saw red and green lights blink over us and I could make out the L-17 . " All right , " said Colonel Min . " Let 's get it over with . " " Take care , " I said to him . " I will see you when we get to the airstrip , " he said . " All right . " I walked over to the forward jeep . As Colonel Park had briefed us , we entered the airstrip from the eastern end of it . There we stopped and turned off the lights . I began counting . Ten seconds later I ordered the agent at the wheel to turn on the lights . I had it repeated . At the other end of the airstrip , headlights shone , then went off . Ten seconds . The lights came on again and off again . " All right , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly toward the center of the airstrip , driving along the northern side of it . Two agents in the back of our jeep were standing up , clutching at the machine gun . The runway was bumpy and uneven though it was surfaced with what felt like concrete . From the other end of the runway , a jeep came toward us , its headlights on fully . Colonel Min 's jeep , behind us , had its headlights off . The other jeep stopped . Someone bounded out of it . We stopped . It was Colonel Jung of the Presidential Brigade ArmoredRegiment . I got out of the jeep . Colonel Min came out and stood beside me . Colonel Jung saluted Colonel Min . Just then the L-17 boomed down low from the western end of the airstrip and flew off toward the east and banked away to the north . " Colonel Min , " said Colonel Jung . " And you too , sir , Major Lee . " We shook hands . He was one of the youngest lieutenant colonels in the Army ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my university before the war ; tall , trim , and handsome and impeccable in his military bearing , fluent in English and French , he was a favorite of the American advisers and an idol of the cadets at the Military Academy . " I take it that Colonel Son is n't here yet ? " said Colonel Min . " Not yet , sir . He should be here any minute . Shall I brief you in the deployment of my men , sir ? " Colonel Min said , " Please . "  |p186Colonel  Jung said to the senior agent , who was directly behind Colonel Min , " Have all the lights off , will you ? We can see better . " With the lights off , I saw that it was not as foggy as I had thought it was , though it was misty enough ; in the dim starlight and the moonlight that filtered through the rain clouds the wet surface of the runway glimmered here and there . I could see the straight line of the runway and at the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the airstrip , running from the west to the north . " I have three platoons out there , Colonel Min , " said Colonel Jung . " All heavily armed . I thought of bringing out armored cars but decided against it . They would have been too conspicuous . I have one platoon deployed on that foothill at the other end of the runway . Another platoon where we are . You ca n't see them , sir , but they are out there , and they can see us . I have deployed the third platoon along the dirt road between two miles from the main road and the entrance to the airstrip . " Colonel Min said , " What about the southern side of the runway ? It is wide open as it is . " " I am afraid we do n't have enough men to cover that sector , sir . We will have to count on a cross fire . " He said to the senior agent , " I have a machine gun set up at the western end of the runway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will you cover this half of the southern sector with your .5o caliber ? I put a marker up out there for your line of sight . It 's white , so you should be able to see it . " Colonel Min said , " What is your signal setup ? " " I will have to depend on my flashlight here , Colonel , " said ColonelJung . " Two blinks and my men will emerge from their positions and surround the runway or us all if necessary . Three blinks and my men will commence firing . When I give three blinks , will you all please run to those bushes there and take cover ? I have sandbags piled up there behind the bushes . You ca n't see them from here but they are there . Of course , this action will be taken only when I think what we have out here in the open is not enough . If theP187L-17 up there buzzes us twice , as Colonel Park has arranged , that is , before General Mah shows up , we will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my platoon on the west will try to join us there ; my executive will fire a green flare  --  a green flare , remembereveryone  --  and my platoon out there on the road will retreat to the south . If anyone comes onto the runway we will have him trapped , but we will have the eastern sector open for us to withdrawif necessary . " Colonel Min told him of his own signal . " Major Lee , I 've just changed my plan . I want you to stay here with me when I see General Mah . " He turned to the senior agent . " You will take charge and give the firing order . " We saw lights on the dirt road that led to the western entrance to the airstrip . It was an open jeep  --  or so I thought  --  its headlight beams swaying up and down . It stopped about fifty yards from the entrance . The lights went off . They came back on . Colonel Jung counted quetly . Ten seconds . The lights were on again , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir , " said Colonel Jung . He held his flashlight . He turned it on . Ten seconds . He turned it off . Another ten seconds . He turned it on . Ten seconds . He turned it off . The headlights of the open jeep came back on and it drove onto the runway , then dimmed its lights . Colonel Jung turned the flashlight on and held it . The jeep stopped about ten yards from us . Colonel Son jumped out of it . He came toward us , his heels clicking on the concrete runway . I checked my watch . It was fourteen minutes to eleven . We shook hands . The senior agent led his men away from us . They started the jeeps and deployed them in the middle of the runway , facing the western entrance . " I ca n't tell you enough how good it is to see you here at a time like this , " said Colonel Min to Colonel Son . " Same here , " he said . " Good to see you , Major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The misty darkness enveloped us.  |p188I  could not see the face of Colonel Son too well though I was standingclose to him . He was short and lean and his head came barely up to Colonel Min 's shoulders . Shadowy faces and shadowy figures  --  I realized that the moon was emerging from black rain clouds into scattered thin clouds . I looked about me . The long barrel of the .50-caliber machine gun on one of our jeeps gleamed . I could make out the dim reflection of the glimmering light of the moon on the bullets in the cartridge belt that drooped from the barrel . I caught a quick glint of the moon on the folded-down windshield on the jeep . The special agents , two of them standing up in the back seat hovering over the machine gun , were still and dark , looking in our direction . " We are ready , sir , " said Colonel Jung to Colonel Son . " Yes . This is what I have to do , " said Colonel Son , speaking slowly , enunciating each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have a radio in my jeep . I am to radio General Mah at eleven o'clock sharp . I am to say  --  Have you caught the rat ? ' Then he will say  --  No , but I have caught the fox . ' If all is clear , I am to reply  --  Bring the fox . ' And if not  --  and this I will not say  --  No , we want the rat . ' " Colonel Jung burst out laughing . " What the hell is all that about ! " Colonel Son laughed , too . " Your guess is as good as mine . He insisted on it . Apparently , he has spent a great deal of time thinkingthis up . When he was telling me about it , he was giggling and rather silly , obviously having a good time and I am sure congratulatinghimself on what a clever and amusing fellow he was . " He tut-tutted . " I pulled a straight face and he said , You do n't think it is funny , eh ? ' I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , so I said , It was very funny , sir . ' Ah , I can see you do n't think it is funny . But you will see , you will see ! ' Yes , sir , I will see , General , I will see . ' He gave me a dirty look . Now , he will get here exactly ten minutes after eleven , that is , if all is clear . When he approaches the entrance to the runway , he wants me top189have all the lights on here and stand alone in the light , but he also wants everyone in the light , too . So we will stand apart but will all be in the light . I want someone to stand behind me when he comes close . " " Why ? " said Colonel Jung . " Until the proper time comes , I want to have a ready alibi for his sake and for my sake , too . I want someone pointing a gun at me behind my back . He thinks General Ham is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him that General Ham is not here but why I had to radio him that all was clear . " " All right , " said Colonel Min . " How far is he behind you ? " " Twenty minutes . But he is out there , right now , on the main road . " " What car is he coming in ? " said Colonel Min . " When we left the headquarters together , he was in his sedan , the black one . " " That 's the one with armor plate ? " said Colonel Jung . " Yes , and with a radio . " " Are you sure that 's the one he will be coming in ? " said Colonel Min . " I see what you are getting at , " said Colonel Son . " He might havechanged cars , for all I know . No , I ca n't be too sure about that . " " So , then , you left together but were separated later on , " saidColonel Min . " Where ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colonel Min seemed to brood on it . " I do n't quite like it , " he said after a while . " What about General Alm ? " " I was coming around to that , " said Colonel Son . " There is a slight hitch to our plan . " " Yes ? " " As you know , our plan , which General Mah had approved , was for me to instruct General Alm to proceed to the village , the originalmeeting place proposed by General Ham . When General Mah came back to our headquarters from the American Command , heP190wanted to revise the plan and now wanted me not to contact GeneralAlm , that is , he did n't want General Alm to be at the rendezvous . He would not explain why and he is not accustomed to havinghis subordinates question his motives . " Colonel Jung said , " Then , does this mean you have n't alerted Colonel Hwang of the Airborne ? His Paratroopers  --  where are they now ? " " As far as General Alm is concerned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take place . He knows that it will take place sometime tonight , of course . From my point of view , since he will not have time to move his Commandos out of Seoul even if he found out about the rendezvous now and even if he did he would n't know where to have them go , I thought it unnecessary to mobilize the Paratroopers . We have enough men out here as it is . " " You may be sure of that , " said Colonel Jung . " So you are not expecting General Alm ? " " I would n't be too sure of that , " said Colonel Min . " No , you are right , " said Colonel Son . " You can never be sure of anything with General Mah . Do n't forget . He still has a hatful of tricks left . One thing we can be sure of , though , is that General Ahn 's Commandos are not going to show up anywhere tonight . Actually , it saves much time and trouble for us . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , after I talk with him on radio , he will arrivehere  --  let us say  --  in ten minutes . He should if he is going to appear at all . When he comes , he will ask to see General Ham . Well , he will know he is not here . I will have to say something to him about that . Now , then what ? What do we do after that ? " " You 'd better leave it to me from that point on , " said Colonel Min . " I 'll do the talking . " " All right . Just give us the word , " said Colonel Son . I checked my watch again ; one minute to eleven . " It 's time , " I said . " All right , " said Colonel Min . " Let 's get this over with . " P191We all walked over to Colonel Son 's jeep ; there was no driver  --  he had driven out himself . Colonel Son radioed . " Have you caught the rat ? Have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No , but I have caught the fox . No , but I have caught the fox . " " Is that his voice ? " said Colonel Jung . Colonel Min nodded . " It is . " Colonel Son turned his shadowy face to Colonel Min . Colonel Min whispered , " All right . Go ahead . " Colonel Son radioed back , " Bring the fox . Bring the fox . " He waited for a few moments , then switched off the radio . Colonel Jung said , " I 'd better go and stay with my men . I will be over there behind the bushes . I 've piled sandbags there , Colonel Son , so if you need a cover , just run for it . I 'll move your jeep . " He started the jeep . " Good luck . " He drove the jeep to the northern edge of the runway , in the center of it , reversed the jeep so that it faced the western entrance to the airstrip . " Turn all the lights on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running toward us . " Sorry , Colonel Min . I forgot all about the searchlights . I have two searchlights set up and ready . How could I have forgotten about that ! One is halfway up the hill beyond the western entrance and the other one is up there beyond the bush . So if the searchlights go on , do n't be alarmed . They are ours . " The special agents had been gathered by Colonel Min . He said to everyone , " We have a change of plan . When I want you to fire , I 'll do what I told you before . I 'll clasp my hands behind my back . Three seconds . I 'll drop down to the ground . We will turn off all the lights out here and , Colonel Jung , you 'll have your searchlights turned on . Is that clear ? " Colonel Jung said to the senior agent , " I want one of your jeeps moved to that end of the runway . Not the one with the .50 caliber . What do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A rocket launcher , sir , and submachine guns . " " Good . Have the rocket launcher ready , will you ? Let 's have three of you stay with the .5o caliber . How many submachine guns ? " " Enough for everyone here , sir . " " All right , then . Have two of you in the other jeep . And now , Major Lee and Lieutenant Cho . " " Major Lee will stay in the jeep , " said Colonel Min , " until I call him . You , too , Lieutenant Cho . " " Yes , sir , " said Lieutenant Cho . Colonel Jung said to the senior agent , " Give them the submachine guns . " " They are in the jeep already . " " All right . Good luck . " Colonel Jung went back to his position behind the bushes . " I do n't see the L-17 , " said Colonel Son . " It 's up there , somewhere , " said Colonel Min . It was suddenly still and hushed . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see only the dim shreds of light through the clouds . The air was warm and damp . Colonel Min said quietly to me , " When General Mah 's sedan  --  or whatever he is going to be in  --  appears , Colonel Son will wait till he comes close enough . ColonelSon will then move toward General Mah and at that point I want you to get off the jeep and come slowly and with a submachine gun . Try to walk behind Colonel Son in the shadow if at all possible . Stay close behind him and when you two get close to General Mah Colonel Son will start talking and you will then cover him . " " Just do n't overdo it , " said Colonel Son . " I have a sensitive back . " He laughed . I blurted out , " I ca n't see how you can be so cheerful at a time like this 1 " Colonel Son shrugged his shoulders . " What else can I do ? " He laughed again , giving me a pat on the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't look so morbid . "  |p193Colonel  Min said , " All right , that 's enough now . " One of the jeeps quietly slid down the runway to the western end of it . Colonel Min said , " Get going now , you two . " Lieutenant Cho and I walked over to the jeep with the .50 caliber . Two agents were standing in the back seat , huddled close to the machine gun ; the senior agent stood against the right rear fender with a submachine gun . We climbed into our seat , Lieutenant Cho at the wheel . The senior agent handed over to me the submachine gun he had been holding in his hands . " It 's loaded and ready to go , sir . " He took another one from the back seat . I put the submachine gun on my lap ; it felt heavy . Lieutenant Cho whispered to me , " Everything is going to turn out all right , sir . " I had to nod my head . We waited . Lights shone suddenly beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrubbery on the dirt road leading to the western entrance to the airstrip . They came fast . The light beams shot out straight , then swiveled to our direction , then swiveled back to a straight line , jerking up and down . It was a sedan  --  General Mah 's black , armor-platedPlymouth . " Look ! There 's another car behind it ! " whispered Lieutenant Cho . Before I could make out the shape of the car behind the Plymouth , light beams flashed out from the sedan , lighting up the rear of the Plymouth . I heard the senior agent mutter behind me , " I did n't know about that car . " The car was long and low , obviously an American make . They were now driving into the entrance , their lights galloping , tires squealing . They stopped just inside the entrance . Their head/lights bounced wildly up and down , then they came slowly toward us . They picked up speed and , suddenly , they both swerved to the left as though going back toward the entrance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sprang to their feet , pulling the long barrel up . " Hold it l " hissed the senior agent stepping up . The cars stopped , skidding and shrieking , then instantly began backing up toward us . The other car was a convertible . " Cadillac ! " whispered the senior agent . " When did he get that ? " Colonel Min was standing erect , his back fully illuminated by the lights from our jeep . Colonel Son stood about ten paces apart from Colonel Min to the right , illuminated by the lights from the other jeep . Colonel Son 's own jeep had the lights off . I picked up the submachine gun from my lap . The stubby barrel and the long magazinefelt cold . Lieutenant Cho had already picked up his and had rested the barrel over the folded-down windshield . The cars had now come to a complete stop . They turned off the lights . Their red taillights glowed in our lights . Colonel Son took a step forward . " Now ! " whispered the senior agent to me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clattered against my knee . I stood beside the senior agent . " Take care , sir ! " I watched Colonel Son . He took another step . I went forward slowly , as quietly as I could . I held the submachine gun in my right hand , holding it behind my right leg , pointing it downward . " That 's good ! " I heard the senior agent whisper behind me . ColonelSon was moving toward the cars . I quickened my pace , trying to stay in the shadow cast by Colonel Son . There was no sign of activity in the cars . No one came out . No sound came from them . I walked past Colonel Min , about fifteen paces to his right . Suddenly I thought I heard the faint humming of the L-17 over my head . 1 was now about five paces behind Colonel Son . Still there was no sound from the cars . No one opened the doors . We were now about twenty , twenty-five paces from the Plymouth . The rear window of the Plymouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Still  --  no one came out of the cars . Not a sound came from inside the cars . We moved on slowly . Ten paces from the Plymouth . Colonel Son stopped . I stopped . Colonel Son looked back toward Colonel Min . Then , looking at the Plymouth  --  its windows were all closed tight and I could see a dark figure in the right front seat , not looking at us but facing toward the western end of the runway  --  Colonel Son said aloud , " General ! " There was no response from either of the cars , which were side by side about five paces apart from each other . Colonel Son called again , " General ! " Instantly , the right front door of the Plymouth swung open . GeneralMah stood on the concrete runway , his left hand holding onto the door . Colonel Son said , " General ! " I stepped back a pace from Colonel Son , whipping out the submachinegun from behind me . I had the muzzle jammed into ColonelSon 's back . Colonel Son jerked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you see , sir , I am at gunpoint . " General Mah took a step forward , fully coming into the light . He was of medium height , of an ordinary build ; a common , ordinary face ; a double-breasted brown suit , baggy pants , a black b ( * tie ; long , thick hair , pomaded , parted in the middle ; shiny black shoes . He stood there silently for a few moments , his eyes darting from here to there to Colonel Min . He left the door open and took anotherstep . I stepped aside , behind Colonel Son ; I could cover the side of the car , I thought . General Mah said to me , " Put that thing down . " It was not a command or an angry voice . " You wo n't need it , " he said . He turned to Colonel Son . " What 's Colonel Min doing , standing there like an idiot . Tell him to come close over here . " Colonel Son said with his clipped accent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Ham is not here at the moment . " " Oh , I knew that , " said General Mah matter-of-factly . " I beg your pardon , General ? " said Colonel Son . I thought
