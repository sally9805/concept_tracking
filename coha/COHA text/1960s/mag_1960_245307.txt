Fidel Castro last week placed his country on the Soviet side . He did it in the most public manner possible : in a speech at the U.N . General Assembly in Manhattan , and in subsequent public utterances . <P> Castro 's four-hour and 26-minute speech , the longest ever delivered before the General Assembly , charged that U.S. " monopolists ' ' turned Cuba into a colony , concluded with a Red-eyed view of world problems . He took the Soviet position on disarmament ( " We warmly support the Soviet proposal " ) , on the Congo ( " The only leader is Lumumba " ) , on Red China ( " We support seating the true representatives of the Chinese people " ) . Castro also started to attack U.S. Presidential Candidates Kennedy and Nixon but General Assembly President Patrick Boland asked him to stop , and he did . <P> Nkrumah 's Hail , Nasser 's Hug . Delivered from a single page of handwritten notes , the speech made plain that Castro is an exceptionally talented demagogue in his own right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underdevelopment struck home with many Latin American delegates , but Castro 's 100% line-up with the Reds hit home even harder . Said Chile 's delegation chief , Daniel Schweitzer : " Castro exposed himself in all ways . " Among the Latin Americans , only the delegation from Mexico applauded him , with occasional support from Venezuela and Bolivia . But with Khrushchev cuing the applause , pudgy palms pounding high over his head as the signal , Castro got enough cheers even for his mammoth ego . Ghana 's Kwame Nkrumah hailed the speech as " dramatic . " Egypt 's Gamal Abdel Nasser hugged Castro and invited him to Egypt . <P> One hour after he finished orating , the Cuban chief passed through the doors to the headquarters of the Czechs , the leading arms dealers in the Soviet bloc , and stayed three hours . Next day he had a 40-minute talk with Nkrumah . Meeting Poland 's Wladyslaw Gomulka , Castro agreed to exchange ambassadors . He received visits from India 's Nehru and from Bulgarian Red Boss Todor Zhivkov , but paid only one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Said Cuban Foreign Minister Raul Roa : " Of all the men Dr. Castro met , next to Khrushchev , he felt a bond for Nasser . Nehru is weak . Not Nasser-he really is a man . " <P> Just like Lincoln . At midweek Castro 's spear-bearers shouldered Fidel 's special refrigerator , two cages of white mice , a bunch of 3-ft. - tall stuffed toy animals bought in Manhattan , and prepared for a triumphal return to Cuba , where every TV station had carried the U.N . speech live , via the Straits of Florida over-the-horizon transmission link , which costs $2,200 hourly . Just before leaving , Castro received a gift package , later opened by the police bomb squad . The contents : ten lbs . of flea powder .
