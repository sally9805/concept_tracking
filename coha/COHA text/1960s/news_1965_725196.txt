txt PARIS , Dec. 14 UPI  --  President Charles de Gaulle said tonight the United States " is becoming an interventionist power , " and he auarreled with United States policy in Viet Nam but added , " I am not anti-American . " In a television appearance , de Gaulle seemed determined to meet the charges of Francois Mitterrand , his Socialist opponent in Sunday 's runoff election for the presidency , that he has d a m a g e d traditional friendly ties with the United States . " Friend and Ally " The president said France was a friend and ally of the United States , but also was on good terms with communist eastern Europe , had made contact with Red China and was a friend of Latin America , Africa , India , and Japan . Michel Droit , editor of the weekly newspaper Figaro Litteraire , asked de Gaulle about the charge that he is antiAmerican . " In reality , " the president replied , " who has been the ally of the Americans from start to finish if not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been another , and , in case of need , if the unhappy event should arrive and if the liberty of the world was threatened , who w ould automatically be the best allies if not France and the United States , as they have of ten been in such a case . " " Not With France Twice " De Gaulle observed that the United States was not with France at the outset of the two world wars , but added : " I do n't say that they were anti-French because they did not always move with us . Well , I 'm not anti-American because at the present I do not always move with them , and in particular , in the policy they are leading in Asia . " After de Gaulle 's 30 ? minute appearance on the national television network , Mitterrand appeared a n d delivered a slashing attack on de Gaulle 's domestic policies , saying not enough has been done for the wage earners and farmers . He said , " each of the 62 Mirage IV planes that are bought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1970 " and " each one of these Mirage IV 's cost the price of two big high schools , of 600 low rent housing units , or of the most modern hospital in the Paris region .
