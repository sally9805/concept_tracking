txt WETHERSFIELD , England , Dec. ** triple invasion of American air bases and headquarters in Britain by the Committee of 100 and its ban-thebomb supporters fizzled today against a barrier of civil and military police , ' dogs , barbed wire barricades , and transport problems . More than 850 demonstrators were arrested , and not one succeeded in setting foot inside a base . Their biggest success came at the air force administrative center at Ruislip just outside London where 1,500 anti-bomb campaigners sought to jam the highway leading to the main gates . By dusk 591 had been bundled into trucks and sent to a nearby Ruislip school , temporarily converted into a police station . Special courts were set up to handle the rush . Most of the demonstrators were fined $6 and released . 400 Turn Up At the Wethersfield H-bomber base in Essex , billed as the main target for the demonstrators , only 400 turned up .

They were met 200 yards from the gate by police manning a metal barrier across the highway . The demonstrators sat on the wet ground . Twenty-one were arrested .
