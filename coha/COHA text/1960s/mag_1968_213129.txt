Eric Wyndham White , 55 , has spent the past two decades coaxing industrial nations into lowering their tariff barriers to international trade . As head of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) ever since its creation in 1948 , he earned a reputation as a trusted and respected mediator . But when cooperation eluded him , the outspoken Briton 's most characteristic tactic was a blunt threat to quit . And often enough , that threat got him what he wanted . <P> He hung on to prepare and manage six rounds of talks aimed at abolishing or reducing trade barriers for more than 20,000 items from toenail polish to turbines . The last of these talkathons , the four-year Kennedy Round , he believed , crowned his work - and his intention to leave became irreversible . <P> Last week his successor , Olivier Long , 53 , moved into Le Bocage , the 150-year-old lakeside villa set in the greenery of a Geneva suburb that serves as head quarters for GATT and its small professional staff of 60 . A native @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of St. James 's since 1966 , Long brings a portfolio of experience that he collected during six years as head of the Swiss delegation to the Outer Seven . <P> Like his predecessor , Long feels that a specific postwar period came to an end with the Kennedy Round . " Our task is to secure this achievement , " he says , " like a mountain climber secures his foothold . " It will be a difficult task , since U.S. legislators , prompted by shrinking markets for U.S. goods , are already considering a score of protectionist measures ( TIME , April 12 ) . Such measures would invite retaliation and the resulting dustup could undo years of bargaining almost overnight . <P> But if the Kennedy Round agreements hold , the new head of GATT and his associates will be able to start work on another major effort to liberalize world trade . They plan to tackle the area of nontariff obstacles to commerce from border taxes to sanitary regulations . Also high on GATT 's agenda are measures to encourage trade between developed and underdeveloped nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead in which the problems of poorer countries will be " of paramount importance , " and his main job will be to help stop the widening prosperity gap .
