For adults who long ago decided that the only TV drama worth watching was the evening news and the Super Bowl , a boon awaits in a minuscule series of specials called CBS Children 's Hour . That 's right-children 's specials . If J.T. , the first offering , is any indication , children and adults alike will be stimulated , moved and entertained by a kind of drama almost never found on commercial television . J.T. , which will be broadcast on Saturday , Dec. 13 , * is an original story written by Jane Wagner and beautifully directed by Robert Young . It is , mercifully , different from most of the pap usually fed to the kiddies on Saturday mornings . Or to any age group at any time , for that matter . " We wanted a children 's drama , " explained Mike Dann , senior vice president for programming at CBS television . " But we did n't want Disney . We did n't want a story about a cat in Scotland , in other words . " <P> Real and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes horrifying account of J.T. , a Negro boy played by Kevin Hooks , son of N.Y.P.D. 's Robert Hooks . J.T. is trying desperately to grow up in Harlem amidst peeling paint , dank buildings , rubbish-filled lots and a way of life that is guaranteed to turn any American Dream into a nightmare . He steals a transistor radio , then befriends a decrepit street cat . He is set upon by two older boys determined to steal the radio from him . <P> Out of this develops an hour of television drama that few viewers will have trouble identifying with , though its story is far from the lives of the nation 's more privileged . There are the familiar dilemmas of childhood ( stealing , lying , response to bullying ) , the familiar authority figures ( mother , adult store owners , schoolteacher ) and familiar emotions ( fear , love , sorrow ) . <P> After moments of intense despair and fear , the climax does turn out neatly and somewhat happily . But that is quite acceptable simply because the audience has been transported-not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another . <P> Unfortunately , there are only two more programs scheduled for the Hour series . Why ? " J.T. cost $300,000 as compared with the $7,000 we normally spend on that hour for kids , " explains Dann . But it was worth it . <P> <P> 812 noon-1 p.m . E.S.T. ; 11 a.m. - 12 noon , C.S.T. and P.S.T. ; 10 a.m. - ll a.m . M.S.T .
