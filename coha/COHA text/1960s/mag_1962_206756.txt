The Long Absence . In a village on the Seine a widow ( Alida Valli ) keeps a small cafe . Her husband , caught by the Gestapo during World War II , has been dead for 15 years , and she has long since made her peace with life , and found a lover , and stopped thinking about things that thinking can not change . <P> One evening , while she muses on her doorstep , a tall old tramp ( Georges Wilson ) strides by . She staggers back , moves as if to cry out , hesitates , stares after him bewildered . Impossible ! But for an instant she could have sworn the old tramp was her husband ! Next day when he comes by again she asks him in . He has a kind mouth and sad eyes that light up wonderfully when she plays Rossini on the jukebox , but something in his face suggests a damaged and diminished man . " I 've lost my memory , " he explains shyly . She faints . She is sure it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband 's name : " Albert Langlois . " No reaction .

She feeds him the dishes her husband loved . He can not remember them . In agony she cries out : " Why do you refuse your past ! Why do you refuse your life ! " Then she sees the awful scar on the back of his head . <P> He takes her hand . " You are a nice woman , " he says gently , regretfully . And then he leaves . She runs to the door . " Stop , Albert Langlois ! " she screams after him . " Stop ! " the villagers take up the cry . " You are wanted ! " He stops as though a shot had been fired , and then , as if compelled by a reflex he can not control , he slowly and with infinite hopelessness lifts his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and if the picture as a whole is rather less impressive it is nevertheless a fine little film . Director Henri Colpi , a 40-year-old film editor ( Last Year at Marienbad ) who had never before made a feature picture , has started strong . The Long Absence is notable for modesty , sincerity , genuine warmth . It is never impelled to seem larger than life ; it is never felt to be less than human .
