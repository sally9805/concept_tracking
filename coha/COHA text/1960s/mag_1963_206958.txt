Inflation is a bogy word that has almost passed out of the news in a day when businesses have so much unused capacity around . But there was no mistaking the stock market 's feeling about it last week : the market loves inflation . As the Dow-Jones industrial average rose 7.19 points , the market clearly showed that it once more sniffed inflation in the air-whether it was really there or not . Spurring the market 's expectations were President Kennedy 's request for the largest federal budget in history and his tax-cut proposals , which will help spur investment even while they contribute to a near-record peacetime deficit . And the Washington-dictated inflationary settlement of th East Coast dock strike led Wall Streeters to surmise that the brakes were at last off on labor 's demands . <P> The market also has more parochial but equally important reasons for feeling confident about a continuance of one of its fastest rises in history ( 100 points in the last 61 trading sessions ) . Leading those reasons are the encouraging earnings reports coming from U.S. executive suites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning to appear in appreciable numbers for the first time since Blue Monday-a sure sign , says E. F. Hutton Partner Robert Stovall , " that businessmen think the climate of the market is going to be good . " <P> On the Big Board , there has been a big falloff in short selling ; in January , short sales hit a four-month low of 5,736,831 . Short sellers borrow stock to sell in the expectation that prices will have dropped when it comes time to buy the shares to pay back the loan . To many , the falloff in short positions indicates that the professionals are currently not willing to bet that the market is going down . <P> Lending further strength to the market is the predominance of buy orders from the normally studious and shrewd managers of mutual funds and investment trusts . The little investor , who deals mostly in odd lots , is still selling more than he buys-and for cynical Wall Streeters , who believe the public is always wrong , this clinches the case for a bright future for stocks . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax cuts and budget deficit may convince even the amateurs that inflation is a danger once more . At such times , they usually take refuge in the market to protect their funds from erosion . Before this happens though , the professionals look for stock prices to slack off a bit from their recent rise-just enough to look like enticing bargains .
