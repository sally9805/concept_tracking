The winner of the 0 . Henry Award for the best American story of 1961 tells out of deep personal experience of the persistent influences that keep a writer from his work . What toll , she asks , is taken during those enforced and unnatural silences that are so much a part of the creative life ? Literary history and the present are dark with silences : some the silences for years by our acknowledged great ; some silences hidden ; some the ceasing to publish after one work appears ; some the never coming to book form at all . What is it that happens with the creator , to the creative process in that time ? What are creation 's needs for full functioning ? Without intention of or pretension to literary scholarship , I have had special need to learn all I could of this over the years , myself so nearly remaining mute and having let writing die over and over again in me . These are not natural silences , what Keats called agonie ennuyeuse ( the tedious agony ) , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Creative Process , " given at the Radcliffe Institute for Independent Study.necessary time for renewal , lying fallow , gestation , in the natural cycle of creation . The silences I speak of here are unnatural ; the unnatural thwarting of what struggles to come into being , but can not . In the old , the obvious parallels : when the seed strikes stone ; the soil will not sustain ; the spring is false ; the time is drought or blight or infestation ; the frost comes premature . The very great have known such silences ? Thomas Hardy , Melville , Rimbaud , Gerard Manley Hopkins . They tell us little as to why or how the creative working atrophied and died in them ? if it ever did . " Less and less shrink the visions then vast in me , " writes Thomas Hardy in his thirty-year ceasing from novels after the Victorian vileness to his Jude the Obscure . ( " So ended his prose contributions to literature , his experiences having killed 154 SILENCES : WHEN WRITERS DO N'T WRITE all his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) But the great poetry he wrote to the end of his life was not sufficient to hold , to develop , the vast visions which for twenty-five years had had scope in novel after novel . People , situations , interrelationships , landscape ? they cry for this larger life in poem after poem . It was not visions shrinking with Hopkins , but a different torment . For seven years he kept his religious vow to refrain from writing poetry , but the poet 's eye he could not shut , nor win " elected silence to beat upon his whorled ear . " " I had tong had haunting my ear the echo of a poem which now T realized on paper , " he writes of the first poem permitted to end the seven years ' silence . But poetry ( " to hoard unheard ; be heard , unheeded " ) could be only the least and last of his heavy priestly responsibilities . Nineteen poems were all he could produce in his last nine years ? fullness to us , but torment pitched past grief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eunuch , never to beget . " Silence surrounds Rimbaud 's silence . Was there torment of the unwritten ; haunting of rhythm , of visions ; anguish at dying powers ; the seventeen years after he abandoned the unendurable literary world ? We know only that the need to write continued into his first years of vagabond-age , and that on his deathbed he spoke again like a poet-visionary . Melville 's stages to his thirty-year prose silence are clearest . The presage is in his famous letter to Hawthorne , as he had to hurry Moby Dick to an end : I am so pulled hither and thither by circumstances . The calm , the coolness , the silent grass growing mood in which a man ought always to compose , that can seldom be mine . Dollars damn me . What I feel most moved to write , that is banned , it will not pay . Yet altogether , write the other way I can not . So the result is a final hash . Reiterated in Pierre ( Melville himself 1 , writing " that book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idea obtruded that the wiser and profounder he should grow , the more he lessened his chances for bread . To have to try final hash ; to have one 's work met by " drear ignoring " ; to be damned by dollars into a Customs House job : to have only occasional weary evenings and Sundays left for writing How bitterly did unreplying Pierre feel in his heart that to most of the great works of humanity , their authors had given not weeks and months , not years and years , but their wholly surrendered and dedicated lives . Is it not understandable why Melville began to burn work , then refused to write it , " immolating " it , " sealing in a fate subdued " ? Instead he turned to sporadic poetry , manageable in a time sense , " to nurse through night the ethereal spark " where once had been " flame on flame . " A thirtyyear night . He was nearly seventy before he could quit the Customs dock and again have full time for writing , start back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devastation of " arid years that filed before " to work through before he could restore the creative process . Three years of tryings before he felt capable of beginning Billy Budd ( the kernel waiting half a century ) ; three years more , the slow , painful , never satisfied writing and rewriting of it . Kin to these years-long silences are the hidden silences ; work aborted , deferred , denied ? hidden by the work which does come to fruition . Hopkins ' last years rightfully belong here , as does Kafka 's whole writing life , that of Mallarme , Olive Schreiner , probably Katherine Anne Porter , and many other contemporary writers . Censorship silences . Deletions , omissions , abandonment of the medium ( as with Thomas Hardy ) . Self-censorship , like Mark Twain 's . Publishers ' censorship , refusing subject matter or treatment . Religious , political censorship ? sometimes spurring inventiveness ? most often ( read Dostoevski 's letters ) a wearing attrition . The extreme of this : those writers physically silenced by governments . Isaac Babel , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what wanted to be written ? Or in Oscar Wilde , who was not permitted even a pencil until the last months of his imprisonment ? Other silences . The truly memorable poem , story , or book , then the writer never heard from again . Was one work all the writer had in him , and he respected literature too much to repeat himself ? Was there the kind of paralysis psychiatry might have helped ? Were the conditions not present for establishing the habits of creativity ( a young Colette who lacked a Willy to lock her in her room each day ? or other claims , other responsibilities so writing could not be first ) ? It is an eloquent commentary that this one-book silence is true of most Negro writers ; only eleven , these last hundred years . have published more than twice . There is a prevalent silence I pass by quickly , the absence of creativity where it once had been ; the ceasing to create literature . though the books keep coming out , year after year . That suicide of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kilimanjaro : He had destroyed his talent himself ? by not using it , by betrayals of himself and what he believed in , by drinking so much that he blunted the edge of his perceptions , by laziness , by sloth , by snobbery , by hook and by crook ; selling vitality , trading it for security , for comfort . No , not Scott Fitzgerald . His not a death of creativity , not silence , but what happens when ( his words ) there is " the sacrifice of talent , in pieces , to preserve its essential value . " Almost unnoted are the foreground silences , before the achievement . ( Remember when Emerson hailed Whitman 's genius , he guessed correctly , " which yet must have had a long foreground for such a start . " ) George Eliot , Joseph Conrad , Isak Dinesen , Sherwood Anderson , Elizabeth Madox Roberts , Joyce Cary ? all close to , or in , their forties before they became writers ; Lampedusa , Maria Dermout ( The Ten Thousand Things ) , Laura Ingalls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their sixties . Their capacities evident early in the " being one on whom nothing is lost . " Not all struggling and anguished , like Anderson , the foreground years ; some needing the immobilization of long illness or loss , or the sudden lifting of responsibility to make writing necessary , make writing possible ; others waiting circumstances and encouragement ( George Eliot , her Henry Lewes ; Laura Wilder , a daughter 's insistence that she transmute her storytelling gift onto paper ) . Unmined Genius Very close to this last grouping are the silences where the lives never came to writing . Among these , the mute inglorious Miltons : those whose waking hours are all struggle for existence ; the barely educated ; the illiterate ; women . Their silence the silence of centuries as to how life was , is , for most of humanity . Traces of their making , of course , in folk song , lullaby , tales , language itself , jokes , maxims , superstitions , but we know nothing of the creators or how it was with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( as at least one Shakespeare must have been ) , was the ritual , the oral storytelling a fulfillment ? Or was there restlessness , indefinable yearning , a sense of restriction ? Was it as Virginia Woolf in A Roost of One 's Own guesses ? about women ? Genius of a sort must have existed among them , as it existed among the working classes , but certainly it never got itself onto paper . When , however , one reads of a woman possessed by the devils , of a wise woman selling herbs , or even a remarkable man who had a remarkable mother , then I think we are on the track of a lost novelist , a suppressed poet , or some Emily Bront ? who dashed her brains out on the moor , crazed with the torture her gift had put her to .

Her eyes quicker to see than ours , delicate or grand lines in the homeliest things .. . . Everything she saw or touched , nearer , more human than to you or me . These sights and sounds did not come to her common ; she never got used to living as other people do , She never got used to living as other people do . Was that one of the ways it was ? 156 SILENCES : WHEN WRITERS DO N'T WRITE So some of the silences , incomplete listing of the incomplete , where the need and capacity to create were of a high order . The Frightful Task Now , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for full functioning ? as told in the journals and notes of the practitioners themselves : Henry James , Katherine Mansfield , Gide , Virginia Woolf ; the letters of Flaubert , Rilke , Conrad ; Thomas Wolfe 's Story of a Novel , Valery 's Course in Poetics . What do they explain of the silences ? " Constant toil is the law of art , as it is of life , " says ( and demonstrated ) Balzac : To pass from conception to execution , to produce , to bring the idea to birth , to raise the child laboriously from infancy , to put it nightly to sleep surfeited , to kiss it in the mornings with the hungry heart of a mother , to clean it , to clothe it fifty times over in new garments which it tears and casts away , and yet not revolt against the trials of this agitated life ? this unwearying maternal love , this habit of creation ? this is execution and its toils . " Without duties , almost without external communication , " Rilke specifies , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a spaciousness which puts no limit to vision and in the midst of which infinities surround . " Unconfined solitude as Joseph Conrad experienced it : For twenty months I wrestled with the Lord for my creation ... mind and will and conscience engaged to the full , hour after hour , day after day .. ? a lonely struggle in a great isolation from the world . I suppose I slept and ate the food put before me and talked connectedly on suitable occasions , but I was never aware of the even flow of daily life , made easy and noiseless for me by a silent , watchful , tireless affection , So there is a homely underpinning for it all , the even flow of daily life made easy and noiseless . " The terrible law of the artist " ? says Henry James ? " the law of fructification , of fertilization . The old , old lesson of the art of meditation . To woo combinations and inspirations into being by a depth and continuity of attention and meditation . " " That load , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That sea which to drink up , that frightful task . , . The will , the discipline and self-control to shape a sentence or follow out a hard train of thought . From the first rhythmical urge of the inward creative force towards the material . towards casting in shape and form , from that to the thought , the image , the word , the line , what a struggle , what Gethsemane . Does it become very clear what Melville 's Pierre so bitterly remarked on , and what literary history hears out , why most of the great works of humanity have come from wholly surrendered and dedicated lives ? How else sustain the constant toil , the frightful task , the terrible law , the continuity ? Full self , this means , full time for the work . ( That time for which Emily Dickinson withdrew from the world . ) But what if there is not that fullness of time , let alone totality of self ? What if the writer , as in some of these silences , must work regularly at something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arts in the United States today ? I know the theory ( kin to starving in the garret makes great art ) that it is this very circumstance which feeds creativity . I know , too , that for the beginning young , for some who have such need , the job can be valuable access to life they would not otherwise know . A few ( I think of the doctors , Chekhov and William Carlos Williams ) for special reasons sometimes manage both . But the actuality testifies : substantial creative work demands time , and with rare exceptions only full-time workers have created it . Where the claims of creation can not be primary . the results are atrophy ; unfinished work ; minor effort and accomplishment ; silences . ( Desperation which accounts for the mountains of applications to the foundations for grants ? undivided time ? in the strange breadline system we have worked out for our artists . ) Twenty years went by on the writing of Ship of Fools , while Katherine Anne Porter , who needed only two years , was " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , away from my jobs of teaching and trooping this country and of keeping house . " " Your subconscious needed that time to grow the layers of pearl , " she was told . Perhaps , perhaps , but I doubt it . Subterranean forces can make you wait , but they are very finicky about the kind of waiting it has to be . Before they will feed the creator back , they must be fed , passionately fed , what needs to be worked on . " We hold up our desire as one places a magnet over a composite dust from which the particle of iron will suddenly jump up , " says Paul Valery . A receptive waiting , that means , not demands which prevent " an undistracted center of being . " And when the response comes , availability to work must be immediate . If not used at once , all may vanish as a dream ; worse , future creation be endangered , for only the removal and development of the material frees the forces for further work . There is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's . For every one entry from his diaries here , there are fifty others which testify as unbearably to the driven strategems for time , the work lost ( to us ) , the damage to the creative powers ( and the body ) of having to deny , interrupt , postpone , put aside , let work die . " I can not devote myself completely to my writing , " Kafka explains ( in 1911 ) . " I could not live by literature , if only , to begin with , because of the slow maturing of my work and its special characte ? . " So he worked as an official in a state insurance agency , and wrote when he could . These two can never be reconciled . . . . If I have written something one evening , I am afire the next day in the office and can bring nothing to completion . Outwardly I fulfill my office duties satisfactorily , not my inner duties however , and every unfulfilled inner duty becomes a misfortune that never leaves . What strength it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little the time or how badly I write , I feel approaching the imminent possibility of great moments which could make me capable of anything . But my being does not have sufficient strength to hold this to the next writing time . During the day the visible world helps me ; during the night it cuts me to pieces unhindered . . . Calling forth such powers which are then not permitted to function . Which are then not permitted to function . 1.912 When I begin to write after such a long interval . I draw the words as if out of the empty air . If I capture one , then I have just this one alone , and all the toil must begin anew . 1914 Yesterday for the first time in months , an indisputable ability to do good work . And yet wrote only the first page . Again I realize that everything written down hit by bit rather than all at once in the course of the larger part is inferior , and that the circumstances of my life condemn me to this inferiority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make it possible to continue working writing late into the night , senseless . Then at one o'clock can no longer fall asleep at all , the next day at work insupportable , and so I destroy myself . 1917 Distractedness , weak memory , stupidity . . . . Always this one principal anguish ? if I had gone away in 1911 in full possession of all my powers . Not eaten by the strain of keeping down living forces . Eaten into tuberculosis . By the time he won through to self and time for writing , his body could live no more . He was forty-one . I think of Rilke who said : " If I have any responsibility , I mean and desire it to be responsibility for the deepest and innermost essence of the loved reality writing to which I am inseparably bound " ; and who also said : " Anything alive , that makes demands , arouses in me an infinite capacity to give it its due , the consequences of which completely use me up . " These were true with Kafka @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rilke wrote that about responsibility , he is explaining why he will not take a job to support his wife and baby , nor live with them ( years later will not come to his daughter 's wedding nor permit a two-hour honeymoon visit lest it break his solitude where he awaits poetry ) . The " infinite capacity " is his explanation as to why he can not even bear to have a dog . Extreme ? and justified . He protected his creative powers . What 's Special About Women Kafka 's , Rilke 's " infinite capacity " and all else that has been said here of the needs of creation , illuminate women 's silence of centuries . I will not repeat what is in Virginia Woolf 's A Room of One 's Own , but talk of this last century and a half in which women have begun to have voice in literature . ( It has been less than that time in Eastern Europe , and not yet , in many parts of the world . ) In the last century , of the women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another , nearly all never married ( Jane Austen , Emily Bronte , Christina Rossetti , Emily Dickinson , Louisa May Alcott , Sarah Orne Jewett ) or married late in their thirties ( George Eliot , Elizabeth Barrett Browning , Charlotte Bronte , Olive Schreiner ) . I can think of only three ( George Sand , Harriet Beecher Stowe , and Helen Hunt Jackson ) who married and had children as young women . All had servants . In our century , until very recently , it has not been so different . Most did not marry ( LagerlOf , Cather , Glasgow , Gertrude Stein , Sitwell , Gabriela Mistral , Elizabeth Madox Roberts , Charlotte Mew . Welty , Marianne Moore ) or , if married . have been childless ( Undset , Wharton , Woolf , Katherine Mansfield , H. H. Richardson , Bowen , Dinesen , Porter , Hellman , Dorothy Parker ) . Colette had one child . If I include Kay Boyle , Pearl Buck , Dorothy Canfield Fisher , that will make a small group who had more than one child . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moldy theory that women have no need , some say no capacity , to create art , because they can create babies ? And the additional proof is precisely that the few women who have created it are nearly all childless ? No . The power and the need to create , over and be160 SILENCES : WHEN WRITERS DO N'T WRITE yond reproduction , is native in both men and women . Where the gifted among women ( and men ) have remained mute , or have never attained full capacity , it is because of circumstances , inner or outer , which oppose the needs of creation . Wholly surrendered and dedicated lives ; time as needed for the work ; totality of self . But women are traditionally trained to place others ' needs first , to feel these needs as their own ( the " infinite capacity " ) ; their sphere . their satisfaction to be in making it possible for others to use their abilities . This is what Virginia Woolf meant when , already a writer of achievement , she wrote in her diary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 96 , yes , today ; and could have been 96 , like other people one has known ; but mercifully was not . His life would have entirely ended mine . What would have happened ? No writing , no books ; ? inconceivable . It took family deaths to free more than one woman writer into her own development . Emily Dickinson freed herself , denying all the duties expected of a woman of her social position except the closest family ones , and she was fortunate to have a sister , and servants , to share those . How much is revealed of what happened to their own talents in the diaries of those sisters of great men , Dorothy Wordsworth , Alice James , And where there is no servant or relation to assume the responsibilities of daily living ? Listen to Katherine Mansfield in the early days of her relationship with John Middleton Murry , when they both dreamed of becoming great writers : The house seems to take up se much time .... I mean when I have to clean up twice over or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and want to be working writing . So often this week you and Gordon have been talking while I washed dishes . Well someone 's got to wash dishes and get food . Otherwise " there 's nothing in the house but eggs to eat . " And after you have gone I walk about with a mind full of ghosts of saucepans and primus stoves and " will there be enough to go around ? " And you calling , whatever I am doing , writing , " Tig , is n't there going to be tea ? It 's five o'clock . " I loathe myself today . This woman who superintends you and rushes about slamming doors and slopping water and shouts " You might at least empty the pail and wash out the tea leaves . " 0 Jack , I wish that you would take me in your arms and kiss my hands and my face and every bit of me and say , " It 's all right , you darling thing , I understand . " A long way from Conrad 's favorable circumstance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and noiseless . And , if , in addition to the infinite capacity , to the daily responsibilities , there are children ? Balzac , you remember , described creation in terms of motherhood . Yes , in intelligent passionate motherhood there are similarities , and in more than the toil and patience . The calling upon total capacities ; the re-living and new using of the past ; the comprehensions ; the fascination , absorption , intensity . All almost certain death to creation . Not because the capacities to create no longer exist , or the need ( though for a while , as in any fullness of life , the need may be obscured ) but because the circumstances for sustained creation are almost impossible . The need can not he first . It can have at best , only part self , part time . ( Unless someone else does the nurturing . Read Dorothy Fisher 's " Babushka Farnham " in Fables for Parents . ) More than in any human relationship , overwhelmingly more , motherhood means being instantly interruptible , responsive , responsible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society , the family must often be the center for love and health the outside world is not ) . The very fact that these are needs of love , not duty , that one feels them as one 's self ; that there is no one else to be responsible for these needs , gives them primacy . It is distraction , not meditation , that becomes habitual ; interruption , not continuity ; spasmodic , not constant toil . The rest has been said here . Work interrupted , deferred , postponed , makes blockage ? at best , lesser accomplishment . Unused capacities atrophy , cease to be . When H.H. Richardson , who wrote the Australian classic Ultima , Thule , was asked why she ? whose children , like all her people , were so profoundly written ? did not herself have children , she answered : " There are enough women to do the childbearing and childrearing . I know of none who can write my books . " I remember thinking rebelliously , yes , and I know of none who can bear and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her side . Almost no mothers ? as almost no part-time , part-self persons ? have created enduring literature ? so far . A Private Journey If I talk now quickly of my own silences ? almost presumptuous after what has been told here ? it is that the individual experience may add . In the twenty years / bore and reared my children , usually had to work on a job as well , the simplest circumstances for creation did not exist . Nevertheless writing , the hope of it , was " the air I breathed , so long as I shall breathe at all . " In that hope , there was conscious storing , snatched reading , beginnings of writing , and always " the secret rootlets of reconnaisance . " When the youngest of our four was in school , the beginnings struggled toward endings . This was a time , in Kafka 's words , " like a squirrel in a cage : bliss of movement , desperation about constriction , craziness of endurance . " Bliss of movement . A full extended family life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dairy-equipment company ) ; and the writing , which I was somehow able to carry around within me through work . through home . Time on the bus , even when I had to stand , wa 's enough ; the stolen moments at work , enough ; the deep night hours for as long as I could stay awake , after the kids were in bed , after the household tasks were done , sometimes during . It is no accident that the first work I considered publishable began : " I stand here ironing , and what you asked me moves tormented back and forth with the iron . " In such snatches of time I wrote what I did in those years , but there came a time when this triple life was no longer possible , The fifteen hours of daily realities became too much distraction for the writing . I lost craziness of endurance . What might have been , I do n't know , but I asked for , and received , eight months ' writing time . There was still full family life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go out on a job . I had continuity , three full days , sometimes more , and it was in those months I made the mysterious turn and became a writing writer . Then had to return to the world of work , someone else 's work , nine hours , five days a week . This was the time of festering and congestion . For a few months I was able to shield the writing with which I was so full against the demands of jobs on which I had to be competent , through the joys and responsibilities of family . For a few months . Always roused by the writing , always denied . " I could not go to write it down . It convulsed and died in me . I will pay . " My work died . What demanded to be written , did not ; it seethed , bubbled , clamored , peopled me . At last moved into the hours meant for sleeping . I worked now full time on temporary jobs , a Kelly , a Western Agency girl ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always hoping we could manage two , three writing months ahead . Eventually there was time . I had said : always roused by the writing , always denied . Now , like a woman made frigid , I had to learn response , to trust this possibility for frui. tion that had not been before . Any interruption dazed and silenced me . It took a long while of surrendering to what I was trying to write , of invoking Henry James 's " passion , piety , patience , " before I was able to reestablish work . When again I had to leave the writing , I lost consciousness . A time of anesthesia . There was still an automatic noting that did not stop , but it was as if writing had never been . No fever , no congestion , no festering . I ceased being peopled , slept well and dreamlessly , took a " permanent " job . The few pieces which had been published seemed to have vanished like the not-yet-written . I wrote someone , unsent : " So long they fed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing or hope of it , my life ? and now they destroy each other . " I knew , but did not feel the destruction , A Ford grant in literature , awarded me on nomination by others , came almost too late . Time granted does not necessarily coincide with time that can be most fully used , as the congested time of fullness would have been . Still , it was two years . To Give One 's All Drowning is not so pitiful as the attempt to rise , says Emily Dickinson . I do not agree , but I know of what she speaks . For a long time I was that emaciated survivor trembling on the beach , unable to rise and walk . Said differently , I could manage only the feeblest , shallowest growth on that devastated soil . Weeds , to be burnt like weeds , or used as compost . When the habits of creation were at last rewon , one book went to the publisher , and I dared to begin my present work . It became my center , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ( By now , had begun a cost to our family life , to my own participation in life as a human being . ) I shall not tell the " rest , residue , and remainder " of what I was " leased , demised , and let unto " when once again I had to leave work at the flood to return to the Time Master , to business-ese and legalese . This most harmful of all my silences has ended , but I am not yet recovered , may still be a one-book instead of a hidden and foreground silence . However that will be , perhaps we are in a time of more and more hidden and foreground silences . men and women . Denied full writing life , more may try to " nurse through night " ( that part-time , part-self night ) " the ethereal spark , " but it seems to me there would almost have had to be " flame on flame " first , and time as needed afterwards , and enough of the self , the capacities , undamaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to believe this for what has not yet been written into literature .
