The world has known many tyrants , but few were as reckless , as demanding , as pretentious , as noisy and , at the end , as rejected as Kwame Nkrumah . He was the founder of his country and had been the very symbol of black African independence . Yet last week when he was overthrown , scarcely a tear was shed for him in Africa or anywhere else in the world . <P> The end came while Nkrumah was flying toward Peking on a self-appointed , self-inflated peace mission . Like the Nigerian coup six weeks earlier , it was led by Sandhurst-trained officers who knew precisely what they were doing . At 4:30 a.m. in the predawn darkness of Accra , two brigades of Ghanaian troops quietly took over the airport , the cable office , all government ministries and the government radio station . While early-morning market mammies stared , Jeeploads of soldiers moved into the suburban gardens of government Ministers and tanks deployed around Nkrumah 's presidential compound itself . <P> White Handkerchiefs . There was little resistance . Nkrumah 's presidential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the compound , held out for several hours ; but by noon , downtown Accra was jammed with jubilant Ghanaians , dancing in the streets , cheering , singing , many of them wearing white handkerchiefs around their heads and white clay on their faces as a token of victory . " Fellow citizens , " announced Colonel E. K. Kotoka , one of the coup leaders , in a broadcast over Radio Ghana , " I have come to inform you that the military , with the cooperation of the police , have taken over the government . The myth surrounding Nkrumah has been broken . " <P> It was quite a myth while it lasted . In his 15 years as Ghana 's Prime Minister , Founding Father , President , Commander in Chief and Osagyefo ( Redeemer ) , Francis Nwia Kofie Kwame Nkrumah , son of a village goldsmith , had striven with some success to make himself all but synonymous with God . His face appeared on Ghanaian stamps and coins , statues of him littered the country , and his name flashed in neon in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Nkrumah is our Messiah , Nkrumah never dies . " Among his official titles were Victorious Leader , the Great Messiah , His Messianic Majesty , the Pacifier , the Aweful , and His High Dedication . <P> Maginot Hilton . Ghana used to be known as the Gold Coast , and independence , in 1957 , came with a silver lining . With cocoa exports thriving and the beginnings of a modern industrial plant , the country had $560 million in foreign currency reserves , boasted one of Africa 's highest per capita incomes . Nkrumah squandered it on such expensive status symbols as an international jet airline , which loses almost twice as much money as it earns , and a $20 million international conference site which includes a bulletproof , bombproof , twelve-story apartment hotel that Accra wags call " the Maginot Hilton . " To promote his image abroad , he opened 61 foreign embassies ; his entourage to Peking last week numbered no fewer than 71 persons .                  @ @ @
