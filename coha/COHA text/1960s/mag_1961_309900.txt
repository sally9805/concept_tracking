A bobbing sea of flag-waving Mexican peasants jammed into the main plaza in Oaxaca last week to witness one of the rituals of contemporary Latin America . President Lopez Mateos announced that his government had just expropriated 267,000 acres belonging to the U.S.-owned Real Estate Co. of Mexico . The land would be added to 807,000 acres of government property , and divided among peasant farmers . <P> Of all Latin American nations , Mexico has waved the magic wand of land reform longest . Before the 1910 revolution , 97% of Mexico 's farm land was held by 836 owners . Today 65% of the old haciendas have been divided into cooperatives , the rest given to small farmers . But now even in well-reformed Mexico , the need to feed a suddenly ballooning population grows daily-along with a peasant land hunger fanned by the propaganda of Fidel Castro . <P> The twin pressures of hunger and desire are increasing throughout Latin America , making the land reform the No. 1 issue . Panama wisely began an integrated plan of land development in 1956 ; Venezuela , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onto 2,500,000 acres under President Romulo Betancourt 's crash program . Brazil 's Janio Quadros and Colombia 's Alberto Lleras Camargo are pushing comprehensive reform and agrarian-development laws through their Congress . <P> In most other Latin nations , land reform is more talked about than brought about . Chile has been talking reform for 30 years , but has settled only an estimated 4,000 families on redistributed land . In Peru , where peasant incomes are among the world 's lowest , land-reform legislation is pending-and still pending . The need and the delay are much the same in Guatemala , El Salvador , Ecuador . <P> The one thing likely to be worse than no land reform at all is a mismanaged land reform . In Bolivia , peasants moved into the big landowners ' fields after the 1952 revolution , barbecued the livestock and planted only enough crops for their individual families . Land reform failed and now the country , which was once self-sufficient , has to import more than half its food . With the same kind of rush , Fidel Castro grabbed Cuba 's richest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production fell immediately , and Castro switched to the Soviet scheme of state-controlled " People 's Farms . " But the People 's Farms are not succeeding either , and fertile Cuba faces growing shortages of every staple , from arroz to polio .
