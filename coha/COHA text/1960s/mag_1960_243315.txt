Sons and Lovers ( 20th Century-Fox ) effectively translates a fine novel into film . The acting , in particular , is exceptional . Wendy Hiller is repellently pitiable as the carnivorous mother who entraps D. H. Lawrence 's hero . Dean Stockwell fits exactly the author 's descriptions of Paul Morel , the almost girlish young artist who calls his mother " pigeon " and dotes on her doting . Heather Sears and Mary Ure are appealing as the young women with whom , and by means of whom , Paul tries to break free ; their characterizations are deep enough to show that each girl is in a trap of her own . But it is Trevor Howard , as Paul 's hardhanded father , who gives the film 's best performance . <P> Lawrence regarded the coal miner Morel with a somewhat priggish distaste , and the attitude marred his novel . Howard 's Morel has a clumsy kindness and a drunkard 's fitful dignity . He is no mere brute , although he has been brutalized by the pits in which he has grubbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between father and son , but Howard makes it clear , as Lawrence did not fully do , that this is part of the younger Morel 's great loss . <P> The black-and-white photography is excellent , and it is to the credit of Director Jack Cardiff that he has used his Cinema-Scope cameras in sets seldom larger than the parlor of a miner 's cottage , with none of the 40-foot ear lobes that sometimes result from wide-screen intimacy . Spectacle is firmly resisted ; a disastrous mine explosion is recorded merely by a faint tremor on the surface of a millpond beside which two lovers are lolling . The impact , of course , is twice as forceful as if the air had been filled with flying coal carts . Much of the dialogue is Lawrence 's , and it is a reminder of what a remarkable dialogue writer he was . Says a rasp-tongued widow : " I like a man about the house , if he 's only something to snap at . " Morel evokes enormous sympathy when he says quietly to his wife : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ye ? " <P> These days , major films generally run well into the third hour , at great profit to the popcorn interests and at great cost to the patience of viewers , but this production , in only 103 minutes , includes everything important in Lawrence 's 500-page novel . The most serious objection to the film is that it is inconclusive . But so is the novel : Lawrence chose to shut off his narrative after Mrs. Morel dies , but before Paul learns whether he has really been set free . If the ending lacks force , it is because it owes more to life than to art .
