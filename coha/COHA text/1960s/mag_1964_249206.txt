Point of Order . The Army-McCarthy hearings were superb political theater . In this fascinating film , a 97-minute prcis of what television audiences saw at the time , the theater is heightened by intelligent and impartial editing . <P> The reason the Senate held the hearings is explained in a terse foreword : the Army charged that McCarthy and two members of his staff , Roy Conn and Frank Carr , had sought special favors for Private G. David Schine , one of McCarthy 's assistants . McCarthy and Cohn countercharged that the Army was holding Schine as a hostage to prevent their investigation of subversion in the Army . <P> Then the drama begins , and it is constructed like a prizefight . In the early rounds the opponents politely feel each other out , and there is time for the referee to provide low comic relief ( " Am I running this committee , " Senator Mundt splutters ineffectually , " or am I not ? " ) . In the middle rounds the opponents get down to serious slugging , and both take damaging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that the Army then attempted to buy McCarthy off . But in the later rounds , McCarthy begins to swing wildly , and Joseph N. Welch , the Army 's counsel , delicately cuts him into paper dolls . His methods are exposed as stupid , his morals as prehistoric . " At long last , " Welch cries in revulsion , " at long last , sir , have you no decency left at all ? " - and the spectators burst into sustained applause . In the end , the other Senators on the subcommittee turn fiercely against McCarthy . " No one is afraid of you ... in or out of jail , " bellows Senator McClellan , and Senator Symington hoots : " Go see a psychiatrist . " Even Counsel Cohn looks as though he longed to desert the sinking ship . As for McCarthy , he just sits there with a strange and frightening look on his face : a smile that is some how vicious , a grin like the grin of a wounded and desperate hyena . The look is the look of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damage McCarthy 's case than any evidence introduced against him . When the hearings were finished , McCarthy was finished as a force in U.S. political life .
