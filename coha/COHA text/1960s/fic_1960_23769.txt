Potaw/Tatorni 's Daughter A Story by Johannes V. Jensen DrawingS by Robert Osborn I T WAS spring on Pistakcc Bay in Illinois . Pistakee Bay is the Indian name of an arm of Fox Lake , one of the countless lakes in this America that is so rich in waterways . The lake is a continuation of Fox River which after draining through a mass of swamps and marshes flows into Lake Michigan . A man in a canoe could find his way from here over the Great Lakes to the St. Lawrence and the Atlantic ; he could paddle through the marshes north to Winnipeg and out into Hudson Bay or look for a tributary of the Mississippi and float a thousand miles to New Orleans and the Gulf of Mexico . Each spring the ducks move north over the mighty prairies , from Texas and Arkansas , touch down on the lakes and rivers en route and continue their journey , fly and swim , quack and dabble their way through air and water toward the Canadian frontier , always keeping step with the sun and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sky ; they pass overhead The late Johannes V. Jensen , one of the great Danish writers of this century , won the Nobel Prize in 1944 . Two of his novels translated into English are " The Long Journey " and " The Fall of the King . " The American inspiration for " Potawatomi 's Daughter " doubtless came from Jensen 's several visits to the United States , including one duck-hunting trip in Illinois in. 1903 .

I stayed by Pistakee Bay to greet the clucks when they came . And there I met Potawatomi 's daughter . She mingled with my hunting almost without my noticing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day and at last my whole existence , the only reason why I was there and lay by the edge of the hay each evening and waited with my shotgun before me in the frosted grass . In the beginning I still looked after the ducks . I rowed out each morning to a brushwood-covered spit that stretched far out into the lake , where I had set out my decoys , a dozen beautifully shaped and painted wooden ducks , which I had arranged in an attractive group on the water just off the spit . They lay and rolled , shining bright on the choppy little waves , anchored with a cord and a lead weight ; they rolled like a fleet of dragon ships and stared strangely , up one moment and down the next and all around , with their painted eyes . They were painted very realistically , correct to the smallest detail , for if you want to fool ducks you have to go about it properly ; there were models of various species , from the thick-bellied Canvasback with splendid 54 POTAWATOMI 'S DAUGHTER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water , to the short little BluebilI , which bobbed so merrily on the waves and sat on its tail and looked up in the sky as if it were just about to take off . A flock of dumb traitors , painted birds of death , which I had set out for the spring migration up above . It was a grim joke to see the communication which could arise between a flock of ducks far up in the air and the deceitful group which lay and rolled like living corpses outside the brushwood where I sat hidden . When the morning flocks came I could see a detachment turn aside from the long sharp line of flight , swing round in a great arc like the profile of a mountain down through the sky to investigate what kind of chaps were tossing there by the spit ... wondering perhaps at the comfortable way they seemed to lie dabbling there . And then when they came trustingly with welcoming quacks , there was a shot and a duck fell headlong like a rush shoe into the lake and all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneath them , and stood straight up in the air as if nailed to a cloud ; and toward such an extended bird-belly sped the second shot ; a moment after the flock is away , spread wildly like a bunch of darts from a catapult . And in the silence after the shots the water seeps through the rushes , the least movement of the oars against the side of the boat rings out like a harsh alarm in the morning stillness in that deserted spot , as I row out to where a bundle of feathers turns in the bloody water . And the silent birds lie there as before and swim on the spot and shine in gay colors like Egyptian coffins and keep their eyes stiff in their heads , rocking a little in the ripples . But if the morning flocks were too well-fed or hurried past too ravenously to notice my artificial ducks , then I gave them a rousing ballad from my hiding place among the brushwood where I stood in rubber boots in water that creaked with ice after the night frost , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aid of a little shawm , a duck call , and the cupped hand . Ra-rap , I played . Vail vark , vakvakvak ! vark ! vark ) vakvakvak ! I could feel it in the marrow of my bones , standing there quite alone in the soundless morning before sunrise , causing this bestial music . I felt like a great duck from Hell , giving an abominable solo in the midst of nature 's innocence . Quack , quack , quaquaquack ! But the ducks came . It was so alluring , it must be a wonderful duck that sang good morning to them . I saw them turn their necks high up in the air and listen , lessen speed , and look about , and then they turned in that great delicate circle which is the hunter 's delight , until one or two of them flew into the deadly shot . I could produce several tones on the shawm ; I always knew how to find the right morning mood . I quacked up to them in bright joy , as if the whole world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sad , urgent death rattle to bring them down in sympathy , I pleaded , wept into the shawm , I sent fiery cries up into the sky and amorous quacks as if from a charming young duck , I put all my heart into the call . I had learned the art from an old hunter in Arkansas called Low . He needed no shawm , he could speak duck language without one ; he sang straight from his throat up to them , so movingly , so sweetly that their wings became weak and they had to glide down to listen . He talked to them up in the air long before I could see them , he quacked and wooed , witched anti lied to them , and filled them with blarney ; he sat as motionless as the stump of a branch on a fallen tree in the middle of the flooded wood with rubber boots up to his thighs in the ice-cold water , coaxing the duck so intently , while he gazed up into the sky with his pale far-seeking old man 's eyes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in between quacking and singing he spoke as a friend to the birds , said extravagant things to them up there , scolded them , but affectionately , and irresistibly . He sat there with a drop on the end of his cold nose , brittle with age like a thousand-year-old being who can not die ; you could see how his old man 's heart beat in rhythm with the weak , frozen echoes in the wood before sunrise , his look matched the violet half-light of morning far away between the trees and the wintry , hopeless dawn overhead . How cold and icily still the day awoke . But old Low 's breast hid that indomitable warmth , the hunter 's love ; it was with an inexhaustible fervor he sat there and called and pleaded until the winged creatures came and he could shoot ! The flocks obeyed him and came from afar , nearer and nearer , rill the long-necked , stubby profiles of the individual birds suddenly made the yellow dawn above the treetops expand , and the sharp wing-beats swelled near like hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Low fired . I. have seen him implore even a single duck , which came flying past high above the treetops on a seemingly very important errand ; he made it hesitate in its flight and turn round , seeking : who called , what voice was that from the swampy woods ? Come down here , you damned lovely duck , said Low , intensely confidential , with a voice of silver as he sat holding the double-barreled .8 in his hands , which shook a little with the cold . I T HAD begun as everything begins , with a slight observation , which I would have forgotten if it had not repeated itself  --  something I saw one evening on the lake . There is an inn on Pistakee Bay , and I ate there , but I lived alone in a house ten minutes ' walk from it . Each evening I went home through the wood along the edge of the lake , and the evenings began to get lighter now , the twilight longer . After sunset the water of the lake lay still and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home from the inn about this time . Then one evening as my gaze fell on the brass-yellow , mirror-like water , I saw that something had disappeared from the surface at the very instant that I had happened to look out . There was a very faint trace more like a soft depression than no more than if a drop had fallen there ; but a little distance away a long flat dome showed on the shining water , a piling up of the water as if a large body was sliding underneath . The next evening I saw it again , just the same way , but a little higher up along the shore . And this time I had a strange sense of being watched by that something that had ducked under at the same moment I looked in its direction . Now my curiosity was aroused . The third evening I approached warily through the wood .. . And then I saw a remarkable thing : a dark head was moving gently down parallel to the lakeside , about ten yards out . A very delicate wash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's yellow water . It was late , the light was nearly gone from the low-lying lake , and as I stood and watched the mysterious head , night fell . The water became dark anti colorless , but still the head came swimming down along the shore right toward me . There was no sound 56 POTAWATOMI 'S DAUGHTER from the swimmer , the dark head seemed to be separate from the water and stand out from it with supernatural softness in all its movements . A black head , gliding on the water , fine streaks after it as if after long loose hair on the surface . . I must have moved , breathed too loudly , or the head out there must have noticed my gaze , for it suddenly disappeared  --  not with a splash , not precipitously , it was simply not there any snore . I had never seen a big creature disappear with so little trace from a smooth water surface : there was not even a ripple or the slightest ring behind it . But a few seconds later the surface some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the water , which quickly subsided again as if the lake 's breast heaved up in a great sigh . This went on for three evenings . I hid myself on the shore or between the trees , I held my breath when the dark head came , but the creature out Eisele always knew I was there , discovering it with some sixth sense or other , and dived down before I could fire at it . I kept away one evening so as not to disturb it , and then I saw from a distance that the dark head swam across the bay in a curved line right by the house where I lived , and then over toward the spot where the lake Bows out toward Lake Michigan . There she disappeared in the falling darkness . Oh , the girl from the lakes , I thought , it must be she , Potawatomi 's young daughter , the immortal ! What does she want in Pistakee Bay ? Why has she trailed her black hair through the rivers to this place from the great open lakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she on her way out to the Mississippi to swim toward the spring in the cold nights ; why does she circle round Pistakee Bay ? Is it for me the lake girl has a message , and what does it mean for me in my solitude ? is it the only Spring of them all , that which is eternally lost , that you will lead me to and share with me , Potawatomi 's daughter , whom the prairie sun and the breezes in the wood and the waters have caressed ? Will you emerge from the edge of the wood with moccasins dripping from your swim across the river , slip out between the bushes to say " Ugh " to me and draw me into the woods , companion of my dreams , my squaw ? By the face of the great Spirit , by my enemies ' stinking scalps , I will show myself worthy of you ( T H E next evening I stayed in my house and concealed myself by the attic window with a pair of binoculars . There was but little light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did manage to see her as she swam by  --  and I could have thrown the glasses , an ordinary pair of binoculars , from me in panic , like a piece of a branch one picks up in the virgin forest and which turns out to be a living caterpillar , so shaken was I as in the glasses ' dark field of vision , against a background of the yellow water , I looked into two dark brown eyes surrounded by dark hair ! The scene disappeared from my view , and when I found her again it was so dark that I could only make out a black body moving through the faded water . Soon after she went under . But this time she left a big ripple behind her in the water , and a little further away the surface broke into a peak of foam , as if she had plunged herself down into the water 's night with strong strokes of her limbs , the redskin 's smooth , eel-supple limbs . She was angry or she was afraid ; she must have bent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water she could reach and that her sinewy joints could master , she must have made the water stone-hard about herself as she threw herself downwards and thrust her small Indian feet against it as against a springboard ; her long-hair must have left a foam pattern from the surface down into the depths . hey-ho , and now you cleave the watery night down there with your low hairy brow and shoot like an arrow over the water plants , now you turn and throw out your arms for a new arm-full , turn and dart quivering into the deep cold water , Potawatomi 's lovely daughter , oh you who can never die . I N THESE same days Spring came to Pistakee Bay . One sign after another had presented itself . The wild geese had passed by and gone north in long , shining white wedges , which looked like harps and sounded like music from the tall cloud castles which spring raised to the top of the blue sky . The redbreast , America 's starling , had come , and the bluebirds , the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woods . In the swamps , in the deep brimming ditches which the capricious sun now made wonders of crystal clarity with beautiful things , plants and mud castles on the bottom , and then extinguished , so that they lay as dark as pools above the underworld  --  in all this flowing and stagnant water the warmth of the nights and the sun brought forth all the creatures which swimand breathe gloriously with gills and thrive in the wetness . Great gold-glittering turtles turned down there in the twilight of the lake bed , two by two , and mirrored the sun in their faceted shells . Bubbles rose from the mud bottom , a gurgling and muffled humming could be heard between the sprouting growths in all that water . Instead of the blue frost which used to lie each morning over the other side of the lake , a delicate green shadow now spread above the shore , and the woods had taken on a reddish tint from the germinating buds . The earth no longer resembled a shield of wintry metal tarnished by the blue frost ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm showers of rain . And the evenings were very light now , although the dusk did not last long . For five minutes at the most the dark girl 's head was visible out there , as she took her stolen and wary swim along the shore , regularly every evening just after sunset . So shy was she , so sharp-sighted , so wide-awake , that I had not yet been able to approach within a hundred feet of her . She must have felt 58 POTAWATOMI 'S DAUGHTER my presence , snuffed it with every hair on her head , she was more sensitive to sounds than one could really comprehend . And quiet , pliable as a willow shoot ; nothing in the world was so gentle , so obedient to the water , as when she sank without a trace and left only a dimple behind her on the surface . Quiet , supple . . . yes and strong as a shark , elastic as a steel thread when she plunged the little propellers , her hands and feet , into the walls of water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lake bed . Delicate and quick , not to be outwitted . . . I had tried every trick , I had hidden myself in every thinkable way , but she spotted me . The same soundless game repeated itself evening after evening . B U T I got her at last . One sun-warm day after rain , a high spring day , when all the world was just like a space in the bluest possible sky , I dug a hole for myself at the water 's edge and planted a bush in front of it , a willow bush with big catkins in full bloom . Now was the time . Now she had been admired long enough ; I wanted to pit myself against her . Long before evening I sat down in the hole completely hidden by the bush and with my shotgun out between the twigs . I had stuck a twig with willow flowers on it in each barrel  --  now , let 's see what she says to that ! I sat so that she could not notice my dugout before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shore , but at that instant she would be no more than fifty feet away from me , and then it would he a matter of who was quicker to react . The water lay yellow and still as she came . And as I knew well enough , she was quick , quick as a fish . The black head had hardly shown itself on my side of the point before it sank  --  but I had had enough time even so to give her both barrels together  --  in a two-foot circle around the spot where the head sank the shot ripped up the surface as if a harrow had been thrown there . I jumped into the dinghy in the falling dusk and rowed out to the spot . There were two fathoms of water , and it was over an hour before I found her . She had not gone straight to the bottom , though she was stone dead ; she had drifted some distance out . It was quite dark , a warm spring darkness , in which the croaking of the frogs sounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said , " Back , back , spring is back , " in chorus , as I rowed in with the dead body . The creature I had shot was a muskrat . Potawatorni 's immortal daughter , who could let herself sink in the water without a trace , and when she wanted to could uproot the deep in great floors : she was a beast of the rodent family , not much bigger than a rabbit . She was the most beautiful little animal I have ever seen swim ; she made that spring by Pistakee Bay into a strange and wonderful time . She had a roundish head with wet , black eyes and a fan of whiskers round her nose , which must have felt the water and every breeze more delicately than we can understand , so intimately that it must have been a part of her nourishment just to sniff around and drink in the lakes , the wind and the rain . She had an excellent tail , as flat as an oar , strong and armed with scales . It was waxed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it was this that gave Potawatomi 's supple daughter her power over the waves ; she had hair round her toes to help her swim and the smoothest and softest fur in the world . Hcr belly was gray . Clad in this fur , which was so smooth that her movements were not to be detected , Potawatomi 's daughter skimmed as rapidly over the water plants as a shuttle through a loom . The four great incisors , on which the mouth could not close properly , were a yellowish red in front , an unusual color that reminded one of buried amber ; I kept them for a long time as a souvenir. -4 , . : -7 ' : - " ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' - ' ; ' ' ' ' N ' , ..
