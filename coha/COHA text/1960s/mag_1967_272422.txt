It was only 40 years ago that Charles A. Lindbergh did it , but now an average of nearly 24,000 people fly the Atlantic - every day . Most of them are eating their way across on the 707s and DC-8s , but down below there is a growing little flock of private adventurers who get their vacation kicks by playing Lindy - crossing the sea in a small plane with little but an extra load of gas and faith in their own skill . Last year about 300 private planes made the trip , and already in the first five months of this year , more than 200 have done it . Some of the flyers are pilots-for-pay who ferry small craft from U.S. manufacturers to European buyers , but many are just plain though well-fixed folks who fly for fun . <P> <P> In their case , more than half the fun of travel is getting there . " Flying , " says New York Film Producer Sidney Stiber , who pilots a Cessna 320 , " gives you a combination of the satisfaction of intellectual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York Real Estate Broker Edward Cowen , such a trip offers " both pleasure and challenge , " but there is no question in his mind that " the whole thing is dangerous . " Says Earl Howard of Ames , Iowa , who , with his wife as copilot , flew his twin-engine Piper Aztec to a Rotary International convention in Nice this year : " If cost is a problem , I 'd suggest forgetting a trip like this . But if you get as much satisfaction from it as we did , it 's worth every cent of it . " <P> Dead-Reckoning Navigator . The most serious source of danger is essentially the same in 1967 as it was in 1927 : bad weather . On the favorite summertime route-from the U.S. to Sept lies , Canada to Goose Bay to Greenland to Iceland to Scotland-sudden storms blow up without warning ; ice can form on wing surfaces at the drop of a single degree in temperature , and the approach to such key mid-flight havens as Greenland 's fiord-fringed Narsarssuak airfield ( known to thousands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is as often as not socked in blind by icy mists . Even though it is daylight almost round the clock along that route in summer , there are few landmarks to use as checkpoints . As Pilot Stiber says , " Any man who does n't completely understand dead-reckoning navigation using only charts and compass had better stay home . " <P> Of course there are plenty of post-Lindbergh improvements along the way . Whether a pilot takes the northern route or one of the less volatile southern routes ( New **25;14653;TOOLONG or New **26;14680;TOOLONG ) , he can get essentially the same map and weather-chart information that airline pilots have . Beyond that , there are radar checks on his progress all along the route , chiefly from nine ocean vessels on station that send out radio beacons . Canadian officials refused for years to allow single-engine planes to begin transoceanic flights from their airfields because the ensuing air-sea rescue missions were costing Canada too much time and money .
