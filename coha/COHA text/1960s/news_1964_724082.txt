txt WASHINGTON , July ** would be a novelty in platform-writing if the Republican National Convention of 1964 affirmed the " constitutionality " of a law before the Supreme Court has resolved that issue . If the advocacy of this declaration were not a final move in the effort to prevent the nomination of Senator Goldwater , the text of previous convention platforms supports a conclusion that this supervention of the judicial function by a lay body would not have been proposed . Its political design is repudiation by the party of Goldwater 's equally lay opinion that two sections of the Equal Rights Act of 1964 are " unconstitutional . " This repudiation , it is hoped , would impair or reverse the present prospect that the Arizona Senator will be the Presidential nominee at San Francisco . But it also would register prejudgment of a legal issue , already raised in suits filed , by a national party convention . " Under the pretense of military necessity , " read the platform of the Democratic convention which nominated General McClellan against President Lincoln in 1864 during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been disregarded in every part , and public liberty and private right alike trodden down . . . . " A. principal target of this attack was the 1863 act in which Congress authorized the President to suspend the writ of habeas corpus whenever , in his judgment , the public safety required it . But if there is an instance where an act of Congress , especially one submitted to the courts , was more directly identified , it has eluded a fairly ' thorough inspection by this correspondent of " National Party Platforms " ( by Porter and Johnson , University of Illinois Press , 1961 ) . The Weight of Evidence This inspection did , however , supply impressive evidence of the soundness of the cynical observation that " platforms are made to run on , not to stand on . " The Democratic convention of 1952 nominated Adlai E. Stevenson for President and Senator John J. Sparkman of Alabama for Vice President on a platform which committed them , if elected , to the amendment of Senate Rule XXII , " so that majority rule prevails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blocked by a minority . . . . " But , replying to an inquiry from Representative Adam Clayton Powell , Sparkman declined to commit himself to this pledge . " No one , " he answered , " can properly give his blanket assurance in advance as to his action on every measure . " The Democratic National Convention of 1960 pledged the party and its Presidential and Vice-Presidential nominees , John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson , to " close the more conspicuous loopholes in the tax laws by which certain privileged groups legally escape their fair share of taxation , " citing the " depletion allowances " of the oil industry in particular . The allowances are still legalized ; the Kennedy-Johnson Administration has exerted no real pressure for their elimination . Moreover , President Johnson in 1960 was a candidate for re-election as Senator in Texas as well as for the Vice-Presidency . But in the nation he ran on the platform , adopted at Los Angeles in July , which the Texas Democratic convention totally disclaimed in September , especially the plank opposing the oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repudiated this Los Angeles plank , but also denounced Negro sitins on privately owned property and endorsed decentralization of the Federal Government , the state openshop law and absolute state control of education  --  all in conflict with the national platform . When Alton B. Parker was nominated for President by the Democratic National Convention of 1904 , after the New York delegates had failed in their effort to have the platform express satisfaction with the gold standard , the nominee notified the convention that he regarded the gold standard as " firmly and irrevocably fixed , " and offered the delegates a chance to choose someone of contrary opinion . They declined the opportunity , and Parker campaigned as the " gold " candidate of a " silver " convention . In 1928 , after the Democrats at Houston had adopted a platform in which the issue of repealing national prohibition was evaded , the Presidential nominee , Alfred B. Smith , served public notice on the delegates that in the campaign he would express his conviction that these laws should be changed and pledged efforts to this end if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
