She did this with her body braced against walls of the well shaft by her back and feet while holding the baby in her lap . Once sure . the child lived , she climbed out of the well by inching her back up the rough sides , propelling herself by pressing hard with her feet against the opposite side of the well .

" " I could find footholds and handholds as I went down , " she said . " When I reached the water I picked her up and somehow got her into my lap . She was unconscious and I thought she was dead .
