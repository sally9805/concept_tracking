To the sun-worshiping Indians of the Americas before Columbus , gold was not so much precious as sacred . The Incas of Peru used it freely in wall coverings , in breastplates , in artificial flowers , in provision for tombs-never thinking of it as rare , always stressing the religious emotion they felt from gold 's sunlike luster . <P> To the avaricious Spaniards , gold was simply rare and therefore of monetary value ; when a nation had enough , it became rich . The Indians were astonished at this attitude , and surmised that the white men had some physical disease that could only be cured by gold . The Inca Emperor Atahualpa had to ransom himself from the swinish Spanish Adventurer Pizarro with a roomful of the stuff-13,000 lbs. , all told . ( For his pains , Atahualpa was strangled . ) Indifferently , the Spaniards melted art into bullion ; their pillage increased Europe 's gold supply by 20% , part of which went to finance the ill-fated Armada . To the modern world , pre-Columbian gold again has great value apart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> For much gold remains in tombs and other archaeological sites , and every new find becomes an artistic Klondike . Laws in Mexico , Peru , Colombia , Costa Rica and Panama that attempt to curb the export of the " national patrimony " are by and large circumvented ; if the gold is no longer exported in galleons , it nonetheless gets out . Last week a superb new collection of pre-Columbian art , " The World of Ancient Gold , " opened at the Travel and Transportation Pavilion at the New York World 's Fair ( see opposite page ) . <P> One of the top art exhibits at the fair , it shows how pre-Columbian goldsmiths of America beat , hammered and cast little miracles of design . For motifs they used the swamp and sea creatures that they knew best-the frog , snake , shark , turtle , crab and crocodile . These ancient masters also made the malleable metal wriggle with curvilinear life : 2-in. - thick ear plugs , nose pendants , golden mustachios that covered the mouth . They drank from gold goblets and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the light . They abstracted condors into broadtailed triangles and sought symmetry in two-headed animals . <P> <P> The show is the work of John Wise , a scholarly , self-effacing New York dealer and collector , and Peter Pollack , former director of the American Federation of Arts . For 75 admission , the viewer sees 500 pieces of gold worth $3,000,000 on the art market , stunningly shown in window-cases designed by Gene Moore , display director for Fifth Avenue 's Tiffany &; Co . Through it all shines the innocence of the pre-Columbian artist , who comes out vindicated in his greatness , as predicted by an early Spanish chronicler : " Thus the Sun taught his people how to be kings and lords over all .
