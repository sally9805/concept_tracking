One of the favorite remarks of men in public life is that during the years ahead we must build a better world for our children . It is a noble statement which expresses the aspirations of every decent citizen . And yet over the years it has become an almost meaningless cliche , because all too often we who make the speeches  --  I include myself in this comment  --  fail to go on from there . We leave the statement dangling . We content ourselves with the broad generality , possibly because we ourselves have too little idea of exactly what we mean . And so in this article , my fifth for The Saturday Evening Post since I left the White House , I want to get down to some specifics  --  in a random way . I want to touch a few bases which seem highly important to me , matters which have a bearing on that elusive better world of the future . Perhaps I should say first , however , that what follows has nothing to do with the push-button life which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mars , new forms of energy , transportation by rocket , or the shining new kind of cities visualized by the planners . Such glimpses into the future I leave to those who are prone to indulge in this sort of speculation . Rather l want to discuss here some of the fundamentals which can make a nation great or , when lacking , can destroy it . And if there are those who regard this as sermonizing , so be it . My mother , who was a highly religious person and a great student of the Bible , also loved to play solitaire . It was her favorite recreation , and out of it and her religion grew a bit of philosophy which she often repeated . With a twinkle in her eye , she would say , " The Lord deals the cards ; you play them . " It was her way of saying that human beings are given talents and abilities in greatly varying degree and that it is up to each one of us to make the best use of what he has . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to nations . This country of ours is endowed with great gifts , indeed  --  far more than most nations  --  but I can not help wondering these days whether we are making the most of what we have , particularly in the area of human resources . Our most important resource for the future is today 's youth , and , while I am filled with admiration for many of our young people , I believe most earnestly that we all need to do some careful thinking about the kind of training the vast majority of our boys and girls are getting in such things as patriotism , morals and ideals , the value of hard work , pride in a jobwell done , the desire to excel  --  and even in the matter of personal health . The question that we should ask ourselves , I believe , is how thoroughly and how well is our generation doing those things that alone can give to our children and grandchildren a deep appreciation of these special values . The problem , l think , stems from the fact that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shifted from a rural to an urban civilization , and as yet we have not fully learned how to live with it . The nation has grown more mature ; people have become more sophisticated . The family by and large is not the closely knit unit it once was , and in too many homes the simple old virtues are no longer given the emphasis they were in earlier times . The problem is further complicated by the fact that a large segment of our population moves frequently , from one locality to another and from region to region . Many families have little chance to get their roots down . I hasten to add that this article is not intended as a lament for the " good old days " ? which in some ways , of course , were not so good after all . Actually , in one important way  --  the area of intellectual attainments  --  our young people today arc far ahead of past generations . But I do think it is wise to take stock now and then and see whether we are losing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant so much to America 's progress in the past  --  and which , of course , mean so much to our future . What happened to patriotism ? Suppose we first consider patriotism . i was about to say that patriotism once was a thing that was taught in every home , in every hamlet , in this country . But actually the word " taught " is hardly precise . Patriotism did not have to be taught  --  at least , not in the sense of a copybook lesson . It was absorbed ! It was there , in all of us  --  a living emotion that permeated the nation . Some of the historians now tell us that it was an unreasoning emotion that sometimes blinded us to our faults . Maybe so , but it was an emotion that on balance was good for the soul  --  and good for the country . I have participated in two world wars , and there was one striking difference between the first and the second that perplexed me and made me a little sad . The American Army in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second it was not . Now , I do n't mean that our American soldiers in World War 1I were not deeply loyal to their country , nor do I mean that they failed , in combat , toperform as well as any of their predecessors . Neither of these is true . But there was a difference in attitude . Somehow , somewhere along the way between those two wars , we had lost something  --  although it may have been only a loss of zestful deportment . Not long ago Mamie and I attended a Broadway musical , Mr. President , and we highly enjoyed it . Written into it was some of that fierce love of-country that our parents , our teachers , our political leaders , and even our preachers instilled in all of us a half century ago . Yet some of the critics panned the show , and one of their criticisms was that it was " corny . " I think perhaps this is symptomatic . Too many of us Americans have become so sophisticated that we arc inclined to think of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as being corny . It is hard for me to imagine anyone being ashamed of , or even indifferent to , patriotism , and yet there it is . And , worse , it is an attitude of mind that can scarcely fail to seep down to our children . America is a magnificent country , with the right kind of national motives . Since the end of World War 11 we have demonstrated over and over our idealism and our sense of justice . We have buoyed up the free world at a great cost to ourselves  --  a cost that often has been tough on families of modest means . We have many reasons to be proud of our nation . What 's wrong with saying so ? Sometimes I look at the emerging nations of Africa  --  which , the good Lord knows , are in a muddle in many ways  --  and I note in all of them a flaming pride in their new status as independent nations . Maybe our country needs to recapture the pride of its earlier years . The only way I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our children when they arc young , before the cynics have a chance at them . Also , elementary American history needs to be taught once more with the same kind of fervor and pride in country that it once was . I wish every schoolchild and every teacher could see the original of the famous Leutze painting of Washington Crossing the Delaware  --  which is now housed in a fine new building at Washington Crossing , Pennsylvania  --  and hear the inspiring recorded narrative of that exploit that is run off there many times each day . 1 wish the eloquence and meaning of Lincoln 's Gettysburg Address could again be taught with the same glowing patriotism that it was in my school days . I wish we could have a revival of great patriotic music . And , above all , l wish parents would learn to talk freely with their children once more about the proud deeds and idealistic traditions of our country . One song in Mr. President had this line : " If this is flag waving ... do you know of a better flag to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old Glory with its 50 fine stars ? In any event , this is one of those things of the spirit  --  this revival of patriotism  --  that we need for that better world we all like to talk about . It could easily become vital to national survival in this time of danger and doubt . Love of country is closely related to some other basic things which must be preserved if the fiber of this nation is to continue strong and true . I have read that church membership and attendance figures are climbing , and that is good . Yet it is also true that many families have quit going to church . People have said to me that morality and religion are not necessarily connected  --  that you can have ethics and high ideals without attending church . Undoubtedly this is so in individual cases , but I doubt that it holds true when applied to our population as a whole . If parents cease to be active in the church and their children are allowed to bypass the moral instruction that they should be getting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rear our young people in the ways of honesty and decency . The nation develops all sorts of problems such as gang warfare in some areas of the cities and pockets of vicious delinquency even among the so-called better families of the well-to-do suburbs . We begin to see trends toward carelessness in ethical standards . Cheating in examinations becomes so commonplace that a great many people apparently are not even disturbed . Parents try to shunt the teaching of morals and ideals to the schools , and that does not work . Our public schools , with all they have to do , can not replace the church and the sincere teaching of decent human values in the home . One of these values is the deep understanding that there is virtue in hard work , in doing a job well . 1 hear people complain frequently these days about shoddy workmanship in some of the things they buy and about slipshod practices in the service and repair industries . If these complaints are justified  --  and I am afraid that too often they are  --  it is a sad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always had a certain number of people , of course , who have no pride in their work , who take the easy way out . This is no new phenomenon . But if the failure becomes chronic  --  if we reach the point where most of us are interested primarily in the weekly paycheck and something called security  --  this will no longer be a vigorous nation . I must confess that I am perplexed as to how you go about teaching children sound work habits these days . In the days of my youth  --  and I refer to myself only because my experience was somewhat typical of the times  --  virtually every kid in my home town of Abilene , Kansas , hadjobs to do . 1 here were always plenty of chores around the home , and on Saturdays and during summer vacations we earned money in outside jobs . If there were no jobs available , we made them . For example , I frequently raised sweet corn for the market . Soon after high school-1 did n't enter West Point until I was 21-1 got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapidly to be second engineer . I was so proud of my job that I almost burst my buttons . I was on duty from 6 P.M. to 6 A.M. , seven nights a week , and I thought I had the best job in Abilene . Later , when I was about to graduate from West Point , there was some question as to whether I would receive my commission because of some rather serious injuries I had received in football and riding . Naturally I was concerned , but I was by no means frightened by the threat that I might be denied the occupation of an Army officer . I had learned long before how to work , and I knew that , come what may , I could earn my living . Children need physical work Yet , in our present urban civilization , so many of the home chores and so many of the jobs that once were open to youngsters have evaporated that parents are confronted with a hard , hard problem . True , schoolwork is more demanding than it used to be , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help in teaching habits ofindustry . Still , there is great value in a reasonable amount of physical work for children  --  accompanied by a reasonable degree of responsibility  --  and I think parents make a great mistake when they do n't insist that their youngsters be responsible for some of the tasks that are still left to do around the home . And while we are on the subject of physical things , I want to say a word about sports and good habits of play . When I hear of children  --  as I often do  --  who come in from school and , with at least tacit parental permission , plunk themselves down in front of the television for hours on end , instead of indulging in healthful outdoor play , I am , as the saying goes , fit to be tied . I think of the startling statistics on physical rejects in the drafts of World War II and the Korean conflict . I also think of the increasing mental troubles of the young and the middle-aged , many of which I am convinced stem partly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people to place enough emphasis on the cleansing therapy of vigorous physical recreation . Our public schools could help more than they do on this problem  --  by trying harder to get all the youngsters into healthful sports , instead of concentrating so much of the effort on the handful of superior athletes who are good enough to make the team . Parents could do more to encourage the young fry to get into the Boy Scouts and other youth organizations which help build young bodies . And in the cities , where there is far too little space and opportunity for outdoor play , we certainly should have more , many more , gymnasiums , basketball , tennis and handball courts , and all the rest  --  not only for the vital matter of physical development , but also to work off some of that excess energy which builds up in youth and can become dangerous if undirected . In that nebulous better world of the future , I certainly would hope that every young man would develop at least a little skill in some interesting sport which he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the White House , I am told , there were a good many gibes in the press about my habit of playing golf regularly . Actually , I did n't read these attacks very often , because I regarded them as trivial sniping and not worth my time or attention . I never took the trouble to defend myself , and I am not doing so now except in the context of what I am saying about the therapeutic value of sports . Of one thing I am quite sure : My rounds of golf made the confining life oldie presidency easier to bear and its problems easier to face and solve . Incidentally , it could be that some of the omniscient columnists never did find out that I tried every day in the late afternoon  --  weather and daylight permitting  --  to go out onto the White House grounds to pitch and putt and hit a few longer ones for an hour or so . It was a wonderful relaxation . It soothed the spirit and enabled me to be more congenial at dinner , and go back refreshed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strikes me that any boy , any young man , who fails to learn the need for regular exercise is asking for trouble in later life . We have made profound medical advances in the past generation , but all the good doctors in the world , all the medical science at our command , can not keep us healthy and clear of mind if we do not take care of ourselves . As Mother so often said , it is up to each one of us to play the cards . College is not for everyone Many millions of words have been written about our schools during the past decade , and there is no space in this brief article to dwell extensively on education , even if I were qualified to do so . On the whole , I think our public schools are doing a reasonably good job  --  an increasingly better job  --  and , with all the ferment now going on in the educational world , I am sure they will make still further progress in providing high-quality education . I am delighted to see that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our better schools to fit teaching and learning to the individual pupil  --  to give both the bright students and the slow ones the opportunity to progress at a speed commensurate with their own abilities . I hope the time will come when every public school will be able to take this important step . There is one other observation I want to make on formal education . For a time in this country17 there was a great ground wave of opinion that every boy and girl was entitled to a college education . It was , I suppose , an extension of our democratic ideal that everyone should be educated . I believe profoundly that every young person should receive the maximum education and training commensurate with his ability ; yet college for everyone is not an altogether realistic goal . We may as well face up to the fact that there are some boys and girls whose aptitudes do not qualify them for college . The answer to this problem may be the establishment of many more two-year junior colleges at the local level  --  schools with two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ academic achievements ; the other , through superior vocational training , to the skills so urgently needed these days . But in any event , even on the vocational side , the student should receive enough education in the requirements of good citizenship to enable him to distinguish between the specious and the sound in our way of life . The latter is most important . Equally important is the need to arouse in our boys and girls an ambition to excel in whatever they do . The instinct to do well , I am convinced , exists in most young people , but sometimes it lies deep . It needs the prodding of parents and teachers to bring it out . Ambition is like the temper in steel : If there is too little , the steel is soft ; if too much , the product is brittle . We have all seen cases where too much ambition has made a man ruthless and callous to the rights of his fellows . The stirrings of ambition in the young human animal must be directed with wisdom and balance . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other matters . . . One of the improvements I would hope to see in that better world of the future lies in the area of communications  --  the press and television  --  which are also a form of education , unofficial but nonetheless important . They are important not only to this generation but to the youngsters whose thinking is profoundly influenced by radio , television and the printed word . In many ways our public communications are excellent , far superior to those in many other countries . I never cease to be amazed at the speed and accuracy with which news is gathered and given to the people these days . The depth and perspective of many magazine articles is a tribute to the intelligence of the nation . I note a good many signs that television is beginning to become the great educational medium that it is someday bound to be . And yet there is another side of the matter . As I prepare this article , the controversy over Dick Nixon 's farewell speech to the press is still raging . Whether or not it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the press is a question which I shall not discuss here . But he did have a point . Throughout his public career , it seemed that a considerable segment of the press was on his back . I suppose it was an extension of the curious " I do n't like Nixon " cult , which I never could really understand . In any event , it was obvious that many of the reporters did not like him , and frequently their bias showed through in their reporting of his activities and speeches . Bias and the technique of the bitter personal attack are nothing new in the American press . We all know how the newspapers vilified Abraham Lincoln , but I suspect that most of us have forgotten that even George Washington was subjected to the same kind of defamation . During the latter years of his second term , newspapers spoke of him as a " tyrant , " a " dictator " and an " impostor . " A paper called the Philadelphia Aurora said , " If ever a nation has been debauched by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington . " Now , I believe implicitly in the freedom of the press , but I also believe in the responsibility of the press . The press and television are not just another business whose sole purpose is to make money : they are a public trust . If a thing needs attacking . then it should be attacked , and I honor our newspapers and magazines for the job they have done over and over in exposing evil . Moreover , every public man must expect criticism of his official acts and opinions . That is part of the democratic process . What I am talking about , however , is not that kind of critical journalism . I am talking about bias in reporting and the arrogant sort of journalistic sharpshooting that occurs daily and weekly in all too many publications . This is the kind of character assassination before which a public man usually is defenseless , because libel action too often is quite futile . It could be that someday we shall have to enact stricter libel laws such as England has . I hope not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will of itself come to show greater maturity . I have a lot of good friends in the newspaper , magazine and television worlds . and I respect the principles and accomplishments of many of them . But there are others who confuse freedom of the press with license to be irresponsible . I think it would be well for the critics , both writers and commentators , to be thinking more about the effect of their words and tactics on their own children 's development than about the size of the fees they get for their efforts . Another situation which I trust will be improved in the years ahead is the climate of opinion in which our competitive-enterprise system operates  --  and will be operating when today 's boys and girls are men and women playing their adult parts in American life . We have reached a point already where a great many people simply do not understand our American brand of economy and the profit motive which is its mainspring . I discussed this problem a few months ago in The Post , and I shall touch upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in which one economic class seems consciously pitted against another  --  a deplorable thing in a democracy  --  has come about through demagoguery . But the business community itself also is partly to blame . Through indifference and frustration and sometimes timidity , it has often failed to defend the very system which has made America strong and prosperous . Business leaders have told me occasionally that they can not participate in political activity because they have products to sell to all and they can ill afford to risk the displeasure of one large segment of their market . Frankly , I think this kind of withdrawal is both dangerous and needless ; the American people are going to buy the best products they can get for the money regardless of the politics of the maker or distributor . During the political campaign this past autumn , I was told of one manufacturingfirm whose officers took a strong public position for a candidate of their choice . There was some talk of a labor-union boycott of the company 's products , but the officials of the firm did not back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase , and the candidate in question , who is an idealistic and highly able man , was elected . Here was a fine lesson and a bright example for our youngsters . We need more courage of this sort . Labor-union officials certainly do not hesitate to participate in politics  --  as is their right  --  and if we are ever to have a more equable climate of opinion in this country , the leaders of our private-enterprise economy will have to stand up and do battle for their principles . I look to the day when all economic classes will have a better understanding of the other fellow 's problems  --  this works both ways  --  and we can get on with the harmonious building of a world which will be happier for all of us . In the area of government itself , there arc various things which need to be done to make our democratic system work better . Discussion of these may one day appear in another article ; I can give here only brief mention to a few matters which have been much on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been wondering , for example , whether possibly we should limit United States Senators to two six-year terms , and whether members of the House should be elected for four years instead of two and permitted only three of these longer terms . In the early years of the republic , there %%as a strong tendency for men to come into public life for relatively brief periods and then return to their regular occupations . We had fewer people who made a lifetime profession of office-holding , and as a result we had more frequent infusions of new blood and fresh viewpoints . If we should now limit . by amendment to the Constitution , the tenure of members of Congress . we would no longer have the unhappy spectacle of elderly Senators and Congressmen perpetuating themselves in powerful official positions , handling legislative matters of the utmost importance to the entire nation . They have been able to do this simply because they represent " safe " districts that habitually return them to Congress  --  where , by reason of mere longevity , they become chairmen of legislative committees . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any members now in Congress , but for all new entrants in the future such a reform could have some advantages . One big effect should be to encourage more Congressmen to vote their own convictions rather than to use their votes , principally , as a crutch to help them to reelection . After all , we have already limited the presidency to two terms , and it strikes me that what is good for the President might very well be good for Congress . There are other governmental matters which urgently demand our thoughtful attention . We need a complete overhaul of our tax structure to restore incentive . We need better executive salaries in government to enable it to compete on a more realistic footing with private employers for the top talent that is so badly needed in Washington . We must push on , reasonably but steadily , toward the goal of full civil rights , so that this will be a better world for all the children , whatever the color of their skin . And one of these days , surely , we must learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need . I believe in compassionate government , but I do not believe in making handouts from the public purse so easy that we develop in this country a permanent class of mendicants who do n't want to work . We must tell our children that relief should not become a way of life . Finally , the better world I envision for future generations would be the kind of world in which people can lead what we call normal lives . For a whole generation , between 1930 and the early 1950 's , we plodded through one cataclysmic period after another  --  deep depression , world war , serious inflation and economic strife , and more war . I understand that some of the political critics now charge the government which existed from early 1953 through 1960 with the high crime of producing tranquillity in America . I happen to be proud of the relative tranquillity of those years , and I think this country could use some more of the same . There is , after all , something to be said for stability with its greater opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people complain that there is no point in trying to make anything of their own lives , because one of these days the world is going to be blown up , anyway . Well , in the first place , I do not believe the world is going to be destroyed by nuclear explosion , although any sane person must recognize that the possibility exists . Secondly , the surest way to " blow up " our nation is by indolence and lack of principle . This is the danger from within  --  perhaps greater than the danger from without  --  but I firmly believe we shall survive it , too , and go on to even finer things as a free and self-dependent people .
