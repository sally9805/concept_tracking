ANTI-INTELLECTUALISM IN AMERICAN LIFE ( 434 pp. ) - Richard Hofstadter-Knopf ( $6.95 ) . <P> <P> To hear some tell it , U.S. intellectuals have been under siege in the modern world as never before . They should relax , says Richard Hofstadter , a practicing intellectual himself and a Columbia University historian ( The American Political Tradition , The Age of Reform ) . " Men do not rise in the morning , grin at themselves in their mirrors , and say : ' Ah , today I shall torment an intellectual and strangle an idea ! ' " Anti-intellectualism , argues Hofstadter , is part and parcel of any popular democracy . <P> Pushed from Politics . American anti-intellectualism began with American religion , according to Hofstadter . There has always been a conflict in Christianity between heart and mind , but in America it was resolved in favor of heart . The Puritans were genuine intellectuals who supported their religious convictions with learning . But as the homesteaders pushed westward , popular religion fell into the hands of evangelists who preached a direct communion with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly and as widely as possible . " Evangelical anti-intellectualism reached its zenith in the revivalist Billy Sunday , who hated learning like hellfire . " What do I care , " he scoffed , " if some little dibbly-dibbly preacher goes tibbly-tibbling around because I use plain Anglo-Saxon words ? Jesus was no dough-faced , lick-spittle proposition . Jesus was the greatest scrapper that ever lived . " <P> Religious anti-intellectualism spilled over into education . The self-made man and the dirt farmer alike were suspicious of knowledge that could not be put to immediate practical advantage . They considered higher education a frill . Unlike their counterparts in Europe , American men deserted teaching in droves for occupations that were considered more manly . <P> Intellect suffered a like fate in politics . The Founding Fathers combined intellect with power . But when John Quincy Adams was trounced by Andrew Jackson for the presidency , the rule of the intellectuals was over , and for the rest of the 19th century intellectuals and politicians went their separate ways , the intellectuals despising the politicians for their ignorance , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Dangerous Time . It took Theodore Roosevelt , whose virility was beyond question , to restore intellect to politics . He called upon intellectuals for help , and there began an intellectual invasion of government that culminated in the New Deal . The 1950s ' reaction against the intellectuals was not so serious as intellectuals supposed . They interpreted <P> Adlai Stevenson 's defeat as a repudiation of intellect in politics . But it was a Republican year , argues Hofstadter , and almost any Republican would have won - let alone Eisenhower , who had the added advantage of enormous personal charm . Nor were all intellectuals for Stevenson . Following the current lodge rules for intellectuals , Hofstadter seems to assume that an intellectual is necessarily a " liberal " - thereby neglecting a whole genealogy of conservative intellectuals from Alexander Hamilton through Henry Adams to Henry L. Mencken and Robert Frost . <P>
