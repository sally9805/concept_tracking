txt // kind of love that develops emotional security ? a confidence in one 's own worth and a certainty about one 's valued place in the world . Moreover , his economic circumstances were the best . Unlike Joseph Priestley , Antoine Lavoisier would never know from personal experience , as boy or as man , what it meant to be poor . Yet poverty of the most miserable , soul-destroying kind was all around him in the Paris of Louis XV , in which he grew to maturity . Even as a child , he could not wholly avoid the sights and sounds and smells of it . One of his biographers , Sidney J. French , pictured him clinging to his father 's cloak in shrinking fear of the wretched children who mocked him , as the Lavoisiers , father and son , homeward-bound from the heart of the city , walked past the Place de Greves and through the filthy , narrow , crooked streets of the Paris slum.l In 1750 , when he was seven , riots raged through the wintry streets of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aroused in him a deep personal sympathy for the oppressed is questionable : The ragged , dirty , hollow-eyed creatures , their faces distorted by hate and suffering , appeared more bestial than human . They were a dangerous rabble ; they must be kept under control . Grinding poverty was also unavoidably witnessed whenever he was taken , as he was each year , for extended visits with relatives in Villers-Cotterets . The peasants of France were beasts of burden , living far less well than the dogs and horses of the nobility . Using inefficient tools and antiquated methods , they struggled to wrest family livings from a few acres of unfertilized soil , and of their meager cash income ( it has been estimated to have averaged no more than 100 livres annually per family ) they were required to pay out more than 80 percent in direct taxes and a substantial portion of the remainder in indirect taxes . " It seems incredible that the peasants survived at all , under such ruthless extortion , " wrote Gaetano Salvemini in The // French Revolution . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interfere with the cross-country sport of aristocratic huntsmen ; if they were caught poaching in the numerous and extensive hunting parks , they were cruelly executed . The hovels they lived in had dirt floors and no windows . They ate the coarsest food , which rarely included meat or wine , and were continuously at the edge of starvation . Often they were pushed over the edge by bad harvests . Oftener still they died of epidemic disease . There was talk in Antoine 's boyhood home about the deplorable financial condition of France and about the need for financial reform . Much of it concerned the Parlement of Paris , where Jean Antoine continued to serve as a magistrate . The Parlement not only was a supreme judicial body but also had the function of " registering " ( that is , publishing and promulgating ) royal decrees , a function which in practice had come to involve the right to criticize the edicts submitted to it and even , on occasion , to refuse to register them . The king might then enforce the registration by calling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de justice , although this naked display of monarchical power was not without risks for the Crown in such times of economic distress and popular unrest as those that prevailed all through the reign of Louis XV . They were risks the king was often reluctant to run . Thus , both Crown and Parlement had weapons to use against each other , and they used them in continuous strife while Louis XV was on the throne until at last , in 1770 , he felt driven to the dangerous extreme of abolishing the Parlement of Paris and banishing 150 magistrates from the city . It was then reconstituted with new members and on a new basis . But those who sided with the Parlement in this strife were not on that account siding with liberty and progress // against repression and reaction . As a political institution , the Parlement was reactionary . Through it the nobility and higher clergy sought to force a weak , mistress-dominated Louis XV to restore to them feudal powers they had lost to the Crown under Louis XIV . Such success as they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to effect desperately needed reforms ? reforms which would reduce their privileges and which most of them therefore stubbornly opposed . Nor was the Parlement any better as a final court of justice . On the contrary , it was notoriously inefficient , corrupt , inhumane , and intolerant , as the great Voltaire ( 1694-1778 ) repeatedly and angrily charged . The consequences of its acts and of its failures to act were all too frequently horrible in that age and land of barbarous punishments . Consider , for example , one not untypical case that came to Voltaire 's attention ; it throws light on that " justice " of the Old Regime that made the regime a continuous reign of terror for common folk . On a highway in Lorraine , one morning in 1769 , a man was found robbed and murdered . Someone said the victim had taken a jacket from a peasant , named Martin . This was deemed a sufficient motive for the crime , and Martin , a very poor and ignorant man , was arrested . He protested his innocence , claiming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crime was committed . None of the stolen money was found in his possession . None of his family or neighbors was questioned . Nevertheless , he was tortured , briefly tried , and quickly condemned to suffer death on the wheel . The Parlement of Paris , called on to review the case , did so in the most perfunctory manner , if at all , before it confirmed the sentence , which was then immediately carried out . Not long afterward a condemned criminal confessed that he had done the murder for which Martin had died . And what // was the form of poor Martin 's death ? It was then a common form of execution in France . Let Georg Brandes describe it : He the condemned was tied face-outward on a St. Andrew 's cross , and laid on the scaffold . Over niches in the cross lay the extremities that were to be broken with an iron rod by the executioner . Next came a few blows on the chest . The executioner 's art consisted in keeping the criminal alive as long as possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a way that the toes touched the the back of the head .... The poor wretch who was unfortunate enough to remain alive on the wheel as long as two days and two nights was strangled in some cases .... If ... the French people showed cruelty in the French Revolution 's Reign of Terror , it was because they had learned it from the autocracy , and it was mild in comparison with that of the Monarchy.3 Of at least one of the major quarrels between Parlement and King , young Antoine heard a great deal when , in his teens , he became a regular member of his grandmother 's salon . The Parisian salon of the eighteenth century was a unique institution , whose importance extended far beyond that of mere social recreation . It developed conversation into a fine art ; it refined manners ; it elevated formal aesthetic tastes ( if at a substantial cost in terms of spontaneity and sincerity ) ; and in a country where the freedoms of press and public speech were severely limited , it provided one of the few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society was small , but it included nearly all the truly influential , a fact giving historical importance to such glittering rival salons as Mme. Geoffrin 's and Mme. du Deffand 's . No such importance was attached to the salon of Mme. Frere Punctis . It was very small , intimate , excessively earnest by prevailing salon standards , and wholly unknown to fame . Nevertheless , it numbered among its most faithful and regular attendants a famous // man , whose influence on young Antoine was of decisive importance . His name was Jacques Etienne Guettard ( 1715-86 ) . Guettard , who had been raised and educated by Jesuit fathers , was passionately committed to the Jesuit order . Most Frenchmen were passionately hostile to it , on political more than on theological grounds . Especially was this true in the bourgeoisie , where Jansenism ( Catholic Puritanism ) flourished despite a papal bull branding the teachings of Cornelis Jansen ( 1585-1638 ) as heretical . Thus , in 1762 , when Jansenists dominated the Parlement of Paris , they ordered the confiscation of all Jesuit property devoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1764 , a royal edict , issued under pressure from the Parlement , expelled the Jesuits from France . Guettard was embittered . He missed no opportunity , favorable or unfavorable , to defend his beloved order with a vehemence that bordered on violence . But it was not Guettard the angry polemicist who pro-foundly influenced Antoine . It was Guettard in his total character as a man and in his role as a scientist . He was a crusty old bachelor , strongly opinionated , set in his ways , and inclined to identify politeness with hypocrisy and harshness of manner with honesty . He made a fetish of brutal frankness and so made many personal enemies . Yet , as with many people of his type , his crustiness was a protective armor for feelings that , in his bachelor 's loneliness , were more easily hurt than most men 's . If he was contemptuously indifferent to the kind of affection that is widely but thinly spread and goes by the name of " popularity , " he craved and was able to give a rare warmth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for whom he cared . He was an absolutely dedicated scientist , who had become a distinguished botanist before turning his attention to geology , a science he helped found . He was a memAntoine // ber of the French Academy of Science . He was also curator of the natural history museum established in the Palais Royal by the Duc d'Orleans . Young Antoine spent many hours in the museum with Guettard and many more on geological expeditions with him into the country around Paris . They studied rock formations , they collected rock samples , they examined the waters of springs and streams , and the boy listened with fascination to the man 's plan for making a " mineralogical " ( geological ) atlas of all France , a task analogous in scope and difficulty to the exploration of a newly discovered continent since no geological map then existed . As for the crusty Guettard , he came to love Antoine as a son of whom he was very proud and for whom he had high arnbitions . He recognized brilliant talents in the youth and was eager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in France , even more than in the England of those days , science was not a profession but an avocation , pursued in such hours as were free from duty . Jean Antoine Lavoisier stressed this fact in conversations with his son , while the latter , in his mid-teens , studied in Paris ' College Mazarin . ( The college had been founded by Cardinal Mazarin , Prime Minister under Louis XIV . ) The father urged on his son the advantages of the law as a profession ; it was agreed that Antoine would enter the Paris law school when his college studies were completed . In any case , the achievement of scientific fame was not Antoine 's chief personal ambition at this time . At the College Mazarin he began to study mathematics under Abbe Nicholas Louis de Lacaille ( 1713-62 ) , who had an astronomical observatory attached to the college . He attended other scientific lectures whenever he could . But his principal aspiration was for literary distinction ? an aspiration encouraged by the college 's curriculum . He wrote drama , but significantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // related to science that he won his only recorded literary success . At the Sorbonne , when he was seventeen , he won second prize in a general competition for an essay on the topic " Is uprightness as essential as accuracy in research ? " How he answered the question is unknown ; the essay has been lost . This was in 1760 . In the same year he suffered a great personal tragedy . His beloved sister , Emilie , died . He was for a time overwhelmed by grief , and it was perhaps a partial consequence that his late adolescence and early manhood were marked by a tenseness of spirit , a seriousness of purpose unusual in one of his years and social position . An Education in Science and the Law Certainly the regimen he imposed on himself was severe when , aged eighteen , he entered the Paris law school . He carried two burdens , either of them heavy enough to test the strength of most young men . One consisted of his lawschool studies ; they were rigorous , and although his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do well in them for his father 's sake . The other consisted of his scientific studies , to which he devoted a whole heart and all he could give of his time and energy . He hoarded the last jealously in order to commit them to his purposes from early each morning until late each night . He cut himself off from all social recreations . He denied himself to his friends , giving ill health as his excuse . Indeed , the excuse may have become a valid one under the continuous strain he imposed on himself : For some months he lived on an exclusive diet of milk . More awesome than endearing was his display of . driving ambition and willpower , and it moved one of his worried and exasperated friends to send him a bowl of gruel with a note saying , " One year on earth is worth more // than a hundred in the memory of men . " If the implied advice had any modifying effect on Antoine 's regimen , there is no evidence of it . Under the Abbe de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mastered the calculus invented by Newton and Leibniz ) until the Abbe died when Antoine was nineteen . He studied botany and zoology at the Jardin du Roi under the academician Bernard de Jussieu ( 1699-1777 ) . From Guettard he took formal courses in geology and mineralogy . He studied anatomy and meteorology ; the latter particularly fascinated him . He purchased a barometer , a thermometer , and a rain gauge . He began to take barometric and temperature readings several times each day , writing them down in a leatherbacked notebook , in which he also recorded precipitation figures . He established a regular correspondence with men whom he persuaded to undertake similar observations elsewhere , thus establishing what are now called weather stations not only in various parts of France but also in places as distant as Baghdad . He continued this active interest into the last months of his life , his belief or hope being that there would emerge from the masses of data thus accumulated a definite pattern whereby rules of weather prediction could be devised . ( In 1790 he suggested the daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in view of his future work , were the lectures on chemistry he attended at the Jardin des Plantes . These were delivered by the academician Guillaume Francois Rouelle ( 1703-70 ) , a great teacher and lovable eccentric , whose influence on Lavoisier 's mind was profound and lasting . It was through Rouelle that he was introduced to the phlogiston theory of combustion that was to loom so large in his later life , and it was in Rouelle 's private laboratory that he first stained his hands with chemicals as he repeated primitive experiments . // Simultaneously he completed on schedule his law-school courses . He became a bachelor of laws in 1763 and a licentiate in 1764 . He was thus formally prepared to step into the place his father held open for him in the Parlement of Paris . But he was not prepared by natural inclination to do so . On the contrary , he was by this time determined never to practice law if he could avoid it , and he was enabled honorably to avoid it in the very year that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old friend Guettard , who had launched his ambitious project for mapping France mineralogically and had found , as he neared his fiftieth year , that he could not possibly complete the task unaided . He had been encouraged to hope for a grant from the government to finance his work , but none had yet been given . Meanwhile , he desperately needed an assistant of superior abilities , who could or would work for nominal pay . His natural first choice was Antoine Lavoisier , and the twentyyear-old Antoine joyfully accepted the offer . For the next three years , from 1763 to 1766 , his major activity was the collection of data Guettard needed , usually in Guettard 's company ? data he later worked over in the Punctis mansion or in Villers-Cotterets , where he continued to spend his vacations with relatives . The two men concentrated their efforts in the Ile-de-France , as the region around Paris was called , accumulating masses of facts about rocks , soils , fossils , minerals , and water supplies . When the Ile-deFrance work was completed , there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at last received the official patronage he had sought : The government agreed to finance the mineralogical atlas , specifying that he begin by mapping Alsace and Lorraine . He asked Lavoisier to collaborate with him , and Lavoisier , then twenty-four , accepted . Meanwhile , Lavoisier had continued to exercise the iron // will and disciplined energy he had first displayed in law school . His social life remained meager as he continued to bear a double burden , that of his assigned work with Guettard and that of his own creative work . In 1764 he engaged in his earliest known original research , a study of the mineral gypsum . When gypsum is carefully heated to a temperature of about 125 degrees Fahrenheit , it becomes a fine white powder , whose essential composition is now known to be hydrated calcium sulfate ( CaSO4 ) . The addition of water transforms the powder into a plastic mass , which quickly hardens , or sets , expanding slightly as it does . These properties make the substance uniquely valuable for the making of casts , for stuccowork , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had become known as plaster of Paris because it was so widely used in Parisian buildings . But what actually happened when gypsum was heated and water was added to the resultant powder ? Why ( in the scientific sense , meaning how ) did the heated gypsum become powder ? Why did the plaster set ? The very simple experiment devised by Lavoisier to answer these questions became , in one essential respect , the pattern of all the great work of his later years . The assumption of the perfect balance between material forces ( the sense of an " equality of oppositions ' ' ) which permeates Newton 's physics ? a way of thinking doubtless encouraged in Lavoisier by his lawschool training , with its emphasis on " justice " ? had evidently become so deeply ingrained in the youthful Frenchman that he applied it as if by instinct to the problem now before him . He very carefully weighed his samples of gypsum before heating them , he weighed the powders afterward , and he weighed the hardened plasters formed by the addition of water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the initial heating , he calculated the amount lost and found that it precisely equaled the // amount that recombined with the powder to form a hardened plaster . He concluded that the process by which the plaster set was one whereby , through a recombination with water , the crystalline structure of the original gypsum was regained . The paper in which he reported this to the Academy of Science in 1765 , when he was twenty-two , was the least important to science of the dozens of papers , many of them classics , which he was to submit before he died . Nevertheless , it is significant to the historian and biographer on three counts . The first count concerns method : It impressed on chemistry a habit of precise quantitative measurement that had not formerly characterized it . The second count concerns the " proper attitude " of the experimental scientist : Lavoisier insisted that the chemist reporting his experiments confine himself to demonstrated facts and avoid speculations . For instance , it had long been known that an overheated gypsum would not bind with water to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact ; but although he believed he could guess its cause , he refused in his report to do so , saying that such guessing was out of place in a science that could advance only through exact experiment . The third count has to do with a personal characteristic of Lavoisier 's which later would involve him in difficulties : He was loath to acknowledge his debts to the work of others . In 1759 , six years before Lavoisier 's The Analysis of Gypsum , there had appeared a French translation of a work on the same subject , reaching the same general conclusions , by the German chemist Andreas Sigismund Marggraf ( 1709-82 ) , chiefly remembered today as the discoverer of beetroot sugar , but also important for the improvements he made in the methods of qualitative chemical analysis . A preliminary " review of the literature " was by then already an established practice for the reAntoine // searcher , but no mention of Marggraf is made in Lavoisier 's paper . In the same year , 1765 , the government of Paris offered through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best means of lighting city streets at night . Lavoisier entered the competition . He studied all the kinds of lamps then available , those burning oil , as well as those burning candles . He calculated the relative efficiencies of different oils , of wicks having various shapes , of elliptical and hyperbolic reflectors , and of different light standards . He estimated the costs of installation and maintenance and even made suggestions for financing the project . He failed to win the prize ? it was divided among three other contestants ( one of whom , Jean Sylvain Bailly , became a good friend of Lavoisier 's ) ? but his paper displayed such mastery of the theoretical aspects ? the physics and the mathematics ? of the lighting problem that the Academy chose it for a signal honor . In a public ceremony on the evening of August 20 , 1766 , in the Academy 's impressive quarters in the Louvre , its president , the elderly aristocrat Trudaine de Montigny , presented to the twenty-three-year-old Lavoisier a special gold medal " by order of the King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paris . Said the Mercure de Paris in its report : " The public views with pleasure the flattering distinction bestowed upon this young author , for which there is no precedent in the Academy of Science . " Mme. Frere Punctis died that year , 1766 . Her estate , which was of a considerable size , was divided between her daughter , Constance , and her grandson , Antoine . The latter also received at this time about 200,000 livres from his father , Jean Antoine , who had exercised to good effect the typical Lavoisier shrewdness in money matters , multiplying through investments in land the small legacy left him by his uncle , Jacques Waroquier . All this was added // to his sizable portion of his mother 's estate with the result that , at twenty-three , two years before he had reached the legal age for Frenchmen , Antoine Lavoisier was financially independent . No urgent necessity to earn a living could henceforth interfere with the career in science he had launched so auspiciously . On June 14 , 1767 , at three o'clock in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept his diary ) , Guettard and his young assistant set out from Paris for their geological expedition to Alsace and Lorraine , accompanied by a family servant , named Joseph . They were on horseback ? the condition of the roads where they were going would not permit their traveling in a wheeled vehicle ? and Antoine 's father and Aunt Constance were anxious for his safety . He had not before been separated for any length of time from his immediate family . In any case , some anxiety over so long a journey was justifiable in that day of abominable roads , which were infested by bandits , and wretched hostels , where bad food and filthy beds were the common rule . Guettard and Lavoisier carried pistols as a matter of course . So did Joseph . Thanks to Antoine 's diary and his almost daily letters home , we have an unusually full record of this expedition . He left detailed instructions with his father and aunt for the keeping of his weather records in Paris , instructions they precisely followed . He himself kept similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between five and six o'clock , before they began their day 's travel and work , he took readings from the barometer and thermometer he carried along with a hydrometer to measure water density and other scientific : apparatus , in his closely packed saddlebags .

He visited quarries , mines , ironworks , and bleaching works ; invariably took temperature and density readAntoine // ings of the water of rivers he crossed , of mineral waters , and even of the water in the inns where he stayed ; and paid particular attention to the kind of stone quarried and plaster used in the regions he visited . At Basel , Switzerland , his barometer was accidentally broken , and Jacques Bariere , an innkeeper otherwise unknown to history , insisted on presenting the expedition with the barometer he owned . At Strasbourg , in Alsace , Lavoisier spent 500 livres to purchase German books on chemistry that were at the time unavailable in Paris , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father . He also met two famous chemists , who no doubt encouraged the growth of the interest in chemistry which Rouelle 's lectures in the Jardin des Plantes had aroused in him . One of them was F. L. Ehrmann . The other , J. R. Spielman , had just published a major work ( it was one of the books Lavoisier bought ) , entitled Institutiones chemiae ( brought out in Paris in 1770 as the Instituts de chimie ) . At Bourbonne-les-Bains Lavoisier was met by his father , who journeyed with the party to Chaumont , where he left to go to Villers-Cotterets while Guettard and Antoine continued to Paris . In the evening of October 19 , after an absence of a little more than four months , Antoine arrived safely at the Punctis mansion , where he was greeted with joyful relief by his Aunt Constance . He was very glad to be home again and very eager to lie again in a good bed , fatigued as he was by his journey . Nevertheless , he did not forget to take a barometric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lavoisier as geologist was not destined to have a happy issue . Minister of Police Bertin , the principal official supporter of the atlas , had given insufficient consideration to financing its publication . The result was that all government money in support of the project had been used up by 1770 , when only 16 of the proposed 230 sheets had been engraved . Lavoisier then // suggested reducing the project to a total of 28 maps , to be completed in five years at a total cost of 40,000 livres , half of which would be supplied by private donors . He himself promised a generous donation . But at about this time the crusty Guettard 's uncertain temper gave way under the pressure of frustrating delays and the hostility of powerful men whom he had personally offended . He presented a report to the Academy , in which he paid glowing tribute to the work of Antoine Lavoisier . Then , in anger , hurt , and disappointment , he abandoned his long-cherished dream . The atlas was finally published in incomplete form in 1780 by the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its joint authorship to himself and Guettard , while using without credit the abundance of valuable data for whose collection Lavoisier alone was responsible . Lavoisier protested Monnet 's " impudence , " as he called it , and a lifelong enmity was developed between the two men . Ambition On June 1 , 1768 , about eight weeks before his twentyfifth birthday , Antoine Lavoisier was formally admitted to membership in the French Academy of Science ? the youngest by several years of the Academy 's sixty-eight members . In those days the Academy 's structure reflected the class structure of the nation as a whole . There was a hierarchy of membership , each grade having rights and privileges greater than those of the grades below it . At the top were twelve honoraires , chosen from the nobility ; from this rank alone could be chosen the president and vice-president . Next came eighteen pensionnaires ; they , along with the honoraires , were the only members permitted to vote on Academy affairs , and from among them might be chosen the director , the secretary , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twelve associes and then , the lowest grade , twelve ad joints , who had virtually no rights at all , save that of membership , and were relegated at Academy meetings to hard benches behind the chairs of the associes . Only as vacancies occurred in the higher ranks could an adjoint become an associe and an associe a pensionnaire . In addition to these fifty-four regular members , there were fourteen special members , listed as associes libres , associes strangers , pensionnaires veterans , and associes veterans . Lavoisier had been proposed for membership as early as 1766 , but there was no vacancy to be filled until one Baron , a chemist , died in the spring of 1768 . It then appeared certain that young Lavoisier ? already personally and favorably known by most of the academicians and strongly backed by several of the most distinguished of them ? would be appointed an adjoint by the king after having received a majority of the Academy 's votes . A formidable rival now appeared , however . He was Gabriel Jars , a thirtysix-year-old metallurgist who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he had introduced the manufacture of red lead into France ) , and he was strongly backed by the president of the Academy , a minister named De Saint-Florentine . Five other names , including Monnet 's , were formally presented to the Academy on election day , which was May 18 that year , but the only serious competition was between Jars and Lavoisier , who was nominated by Lalande , the astronomer . Although Lavoisier received more votes than any other candidate in the balloting that followed , his margin over Jars was slender and in any case was not decisive . The Academy proposed , but the king disposed ? and De Saint-Florentine , presenting the names of both Jars and Lavoisier to Louis XV , recommended Jars for the appointment . He was , however , respectful of the majority opinion of his colleagues in the Academy and accordingly further recommended a special // arrangement whereby Lavoisier would be appointed an ad joint , increasing the membership by one above the legal sixty-eight , with the understanding that there would be no new election when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his interest in the Academy and in science was very slight ) , and Lavoisier " won at his tender years an honor seldom attained under the age of fifty , " to quote a letter received by Aunt Constance from a cousin of Antoine 's . ( Jars died a year later , and Lavoisier 's membership was regularized . ) Election to the Academy was not the only crucial event in Antoine 's life in the year 1768 . When Lalande concluded his nominating speech , on May 18 , he did so in the following words : " Monsieur Lavoisier is a young man of excellent repute , high intellect , and clear mind whose considerable fortune permits him to devote himself wholly to science . " But if his " fortune " was " considerable , " it was evidently not large enough to satisfy the ambitious young man . He had taken steps to increase it just two months before ? steps that were regarded at the time as highly questionable on moral grounds by many of his scientific colleagues . ( The latter were reassured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinners that he will give us will be all the better ! " ) He had entered the ferme gene'rale , the company of financiers who collected the king 's taxes for him in the expectation ? usually but not always fulfilled ? of large profits . Each farmer-general , as the member was called , paid into the royal treasury the sum of 1,500,000 livres , purchasing with this the right to retain for himself such taxes as he could collect over a six-year period , at the end of which period he must renew his lease with the payment of another 1,500,000 livres . Antoine Lavoisier had only a third of the required amount to invest in March , 1768 , but with it he purchased from a full-fledged farmer-general , named Baudon , a one-third interest in the lease of // Jean Alaterre . Lavoisier became a full-fledged farmer-general in 1780 , a year after Baudon 's death . There were valid reasons for the loathing inspired in the masses by the farmers-general ; Lavoisier 's joining this enterprise has required apologetic explanations from his otherwise admiring biographers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morals and manners of an American racketeer , extorting taxes by violence or the threat of violence from those least able to pay them , while flaunting their own wealth before the eyes of their victims . If the situation had somewhat improved during Louis XV 's reign , it remained outrageous to acutely sensitive social consciences , and as one of Lavoisier 's biographers put it , " it is difficult to understand why Lavoisier chose to enter this nefarious organization . " This biographer , Sidney J. French , went on : His social status as a farmer would certainly be no higher than that which he would have gained by entering his father 's profession , or becoming a member of parlement . He knew the malodorous history of the tax farm , * since in his investigation of it he prepared a paper on its history . ... It is reasonable to conclude that Lavoisier was prompted by no other motive than that which would give him con siderable free time to devote to science . Yet , it was the most unfortunate step the young man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so to a backward look , but at the time and long after , Lavoisier might count it one of the most fortunate steps he ever took . It greatly increased his wealth ? he profited to the extent of nearly 1,200,000 livres from the ferme between 1768 and 1786 , according to one careful estimate ? and it led directly to his marriage , which proved to be singularly happy . // He was assigned to the tobacco committee of the tax farm . The committee was headed by a very able administrator of wide culture and moderately liberal political views , named Jacques Paulze . From Paulze as a public administrator , the young Lavoisier evidently learned a great deal , and to the work of Paulze 's committee he began at once to make valuable contributions : He was away from Paris for months at a time , examining tobacco warehouses , manufacturing plants , the watering of tobacco , and customs arrangements and in general collecting the factual information with which to support the proposals he was soon making for reforms of the f erme 's operation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even more : In the brilliant Paulze salon , which he frequented , he met and mingled with France 's liberal intellectual leaders , men strongly committed to the reform or abolition of antiquated social institutions . All these men were imbued with the spirit of the French Encyclopedia , the multivolumed work whose publication , begun in 1715 , was called by Andre Billy " the greatest event . . . in the history of intellectual civilization since the invention of printing . " Certainly the Encyclopedia was of prime importance . Its basic theme was that of Locke 's philosophy ( liberal France learned from England in those days ) ; its articles emphasized over and over again that the facts of sense experience must be the final test of the validity of ideas ; and as a whole it generated a mental climate of skepticism , materialism , and humanism that favored science while subverting the ancient authorities of Church and Crown . One of its later contributors , whom Lavoisier met in the Paulze salon , was the Marquis de Condorcet , whose lifespan was virtually identical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lavoisier ; the two were to die in 1794 ) and whose temperament was evidently so similar to his as to make it difficult for the two to like each other , // despite their great mutual respect . Condorcet , a brilliant mathematician , became a member of the Academy of Science in 1769 . He might have come in as an honoraire , for he was of noble birth , but he preferred to enter as a working member . In this capacity he was destined to become , in 1777 , the Academy 's permanent secretary ? not a very satisfactory one , in Lavoisier 's view , since his interest in science lagged so far behind his interest in political economy that he neglected ( charged Lavoisier ) his official Academy duties . Condorcet himself denied , in effect , any basis to the distinction between " science " and " political economy , " for he was what is known as a " Physiocrat . " So were the other key figures encountered by Lavoisier in the Paulze salon : Anne Robert Jacques Turgot ; Pierre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part as a consequence of his close friendship with Lavoisier , were to found in America the giant chemical firm of Du Pont de Nemours ; Chretien Guillaume de Lamoignon de Malesherbes , the jurist , who was to serve Louis XVI as minister and was to be one of the defense counsels when the king went on trial for his life before the National Convention in 1793 ; Trudaine de Montigny , tax reformer , academician , Director of Highways , and already a great friend and admirer of Lavoisier 's ; and Paulze himself . Lavoisier became essentially a Physiocrat insofar as he theorized at all in this field . What did the Physiocrats believe ? As followers of Francois Quesnay ( 1694-1774 ) and as perfect specimens of the eighteenthcentury rationalist , they believed there was an " inherent natural order " whereby society could and should be governed , the proper or just laws of society being of a piece with those that " govern " the physical world . To recognize this order and these laws was to recognize that land is the basis of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that // unlimited freedom of industry and trade could alone ensure their " natural " development . A growing interest in Physiocratic doctrine and the companionship of brilliant men were not all that drew Lavoisier to the Paulze salon in 1770 and 1771 . After the death of Mine . Paulze in 1769 , Jacques Paulze 's hostess was his daughter , Marie Anne Pierette . She was only thirteen when her reign as hostess began , but mentally and physically she was remarkably mature for her years . She was also remarkably attractive ? a proud , slender , vivacious girl , whose eyes sparkled with intelligence below level brows , who played the harp and painted pictures with more than common talent , and who displayed in conversation a quick wit and an equally quick appreciation of the wit of others . Lavoisier was drawn to her . Easy to discern in the charming child was the exciting woman she would become ? a somewhat haughty beauty who would possess all the social graces , as well as a precise mind joined to a strong will , not unlike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revealed in various ways to her and her father that he wished her for his wife . To the realization of this wish there was , at the outset , a serious obstacle . Her rnother 's uncle was the powerful , ruthless , and hated Abbe Terray , at the time Controller General of Finance , who wished for personal political reasons to arrange a marriage between his grandniece Marie and the Comte d'Amerval . The count had nothing to recommend him to a young convent-educated girl , save his title and a position in the highest society . He was fifty years old , ugly , dissipated , and penniless ( the probable size of Marie 's dowry was one of her chief attractions for him ) . But he happened to be a favorite of the king 's mistress , Mme. du Barry , whose powerful support the Abbe Terray then badly needed . Hence , the latter was furious when this mere slip of a girl , Marie , put up a wrathful , tearful , stubAntoine // born resistance to the proposal ? and was sustained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to marry a man to whom she has so decided an aversion ! " said Paulze firmly . He risked much for his daughter 's happiness and his own honor ; it appeared certain for a time that the Abbe would carry out his threat to dismiss Paulze from the ferme in disgrace . But Paulze was not wholly defenseless , and the Abbe was pointedly reminded of this by one of Paulze 's most influential colleagues in the ferme , who wrote : " M. Paulze is necessary to the ferme . He has instituted many needed reforms . . . . His loss would be a great blow .... " Terray was made to realize that the dismissal he contemplated might produce reactions dangerous to his own position ; after all , if this position had been perfectly secure , if he had not felt the need for more support , he would not have proposed this marriage in the first place . He backed down . Lavoisier at once proposed . The child-woman Marie had been constantly comparing the ugly old count with the handsome young scientist ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ d'Amerval . Lavoisier , now twenty-seven , was a handsome figure of a man . He was not especially robust ? indeed his physical strength was not always equal to the strains he imposed on it ? but he was tall ( Marie at her tallest came barely to his shoulder ) and beautifully proportioned , his well-shaped legs showing to advantage in the long hose and tight knee breeches which were the standard masculine attire in those days . He was handsome of face , too . It was an oval face , rather smaller than might be expected above a body of his size , its tall forehead framed ( when he was in his natural , private , unpowdered state ) by long chestnut hair . His eyebrows had a proudly perfect arch above clear deep-set eyes and , with his aquiline nose and finely modeled lips and chin , imparted to his countenance as a whole a far more " aristocratic " look than that which characterized the truly // aristocratic count . Lavoisier 's manners were as pleasing as his person . His essential seriousness had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of his contemporaries , possessing his means , were involved in a succession of light love affairs and otherwise indulging themselves in the frivolities of Paris ; but it did not follow from this that he was at all gauche in fashionable drawing rooms . He had , on the contrary , an abundance of savoir faire , thanks in part to his Aunt Constance 's training and even more to the quiet deep self-confidence born of the love lavished on him as a child , his economic security , and the honors he had won at an unusually early age . Mlle. Marie Paulze was flattered by the attentions of so eminently eligible a bachelor . Very soon she deeply loved him . His offer of marriage was accepted as soon as it was made ; it was deemed well that Marie become a bride as quickly as possible , to forestall possible further aggressions by the Abbe Terray or the Comte d'Amerval . The marriage contract was signed on December 4 , 1771 . In it , Paulze agreed to pay 20,000 livres at once to the prospective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . If this seems a substantial amount , it was certainly not so large in the circumstances as to justify the charge sometimes made that Lavoisier married for money . He already had money ; his annual profit from the ferme approximated the amount that Paulze was pledged to pay him over a period of six years . He also had , or soon would have , a patent of nobility , purchased for him by his father , Jean Antoine . The sale of such patents , whose owners became equerries to the king , was one of the ways that money was brought into the perpetually depleted royal treasury of Louis XV , and although Antoine Lavoisier seems never to have used the title thus conferred on him , he gained from it various privileges . Far more important to Antoine 's happiness than the size // of Marie 's dowry was the fact that among the 200 guests who gathered at the home of Terray de Rozier , brother of the Abbe , to witness the signing of the contract , were the dowager Comtesse d'Amerval and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruin that had threatened him . The Abbe Terray , reconciled , offered his private chapel for the wedding ceremony , which was performed there just twelve days later , December 16 , 1771 . The couple then moved into a small mansion , in the Rue Neuve-des-Bons-Enfants , presented to them as a wedding gift by Antoine 's father . The husband was then twenty-eight . His bride was fourteen . The child bride was destined never to become a mother , but she became much more than a typically loving wife and keeper of her husband 's house . She knew her husband was a genius ; she was determined to make herself the companion and collaborator of genius ; and her natural abilities ? her quick intelligence , her industry , and her selfdiscipline ? were fully equal to the role . She put her talent for drawing at her husband 's service , illustrating his scientific reports with accurate renditions of his experiments and equipment . She learned English to translate into French , for her husband 's use , the current scientific papers of Englishmen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She so trained herself in the techniques of science , under her husband 's tutelage , that she was able to serve him as laboratory assistant ; many of the entries in his now-classic laboratory notebooks are in her script . First Steps Toward a New Chemistry By the tirne Lavoisier was married , chemistry had clearly established itself as his principal scientific interest , outstripping such rivals for his attention as geology and meteTHE // orology . Actually , as exemplified by The Analysis of Gypsum , his interest in chemistry had grown directly out of his work with Guettard in mineralogy . When his method ? employed in his mineralogical work ? of determining the purity of water by use of sensitive hydrometers was criticized in 1767 , he was stimulated to make his first truly important contribution to the transactions of the Academy . What the hydrometer directly measures , of course , is the density of water ? its weight per unit volume ? but Lavoisier had assumed that this was tantamount to a measurement of purity since density increases with the quantity of dissolved impurities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purer the water , the ultimate standard of purity is distilled water , whose density remains constant so long as its temperature is constant . The assumption ? involving the constancy or unalterability of distilled ( pure ) water ? was brought into question by the fact that when distilled water was evaporated to dryness in a glass vessel , a slight but palpable residue invariably was left . Le Roy , a chemist of distinguished reputation , explained this in a paper presented to the Academy , asserting that the addition to water of heat ( then considered a " subtle " or " imponderable " fluid ) resulted in the transmutation of water into earth . To deterrnine the truth or falsity of this assertion , Lavoisier , in the fall of 1768 , devised an experiment similar to , if not modeled on , one conducted by the Englishman Joseph Black ( 1728-99 ) about thirteen years before . " Lavoisier bought from the official of the mint , named Chemin , who had made it , a balancing scale of such sensitivity that it would turn with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five or six pounds . He also had a glassblower make a vessel whose peculiar shape had caused it in the days of the alchemists to be called a " pelican . " When water poured into the base of a pelican was boiled , its vapor and steam // went up the neck into an upper chamber , where because of the lower temperature , it condensed and then ran back down the neck into the base , where it was again vaporized . Thus , the same water could be distilled in the same vessel over and over . Lavoisier 's first step was to obtain water that had already been distilled eight times and was therefore , by his assump-tion , perfectly pure and unalterable . Using some of this water , he carefully washed and dried the pelican ; then he weighed it with extreme care , first in one pan of the bal-ance and then in the other , recording the mean between the two readings as the weight . Next , he poured a meas-ured quantity of water into the pelican and warmed it gently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's stopper from time to time so that some of the heated air might escape , reducing the danger of breakage by the pressure of expanding air . This done , he thrust the stopper hard into the pelican and weighed the vessel with its water in the same way that he had weighed it empty . Finally , he sealed the stopper in the pelican , which he placed in a sand // bath * in such a way that whatever solid substance accu mulated in the vessel 's base would be observable . The preparations were now complete . On October 24 , 1768 , the actual experiment began . Below the sand bath had been placed a lamp of six wicks , which were to be fed by a constant supply of olive oil and trimmed every twelfth hour . This lamp was now lighted , and it burned steadily , uninterruptedly for 101 days , main taining a water temperature in the pelican of from 60 to 70 degrees on the Reaumur scale he used , or of from 167 to 192 degrees Fahrenheit . For the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then Lavoisier saw some very fine particles dancing through the water , particles that appeared through a magnifying lens as irreg ularly shaped gray flakes . In the days immediately follow ing , the flakes increased in size ; but they ceased doing this after December 15 , and after December 20 they settled to the vessel 's bottom , the water above being again perfectly clear by the end of January , 1769 . On February 1 , Lavoisier removed the heat from under the sand bath and removed the sealing stuff from the stopper , without removing the latter . He then weighed the pelican and found that it weighed precisely the same as it had when the experiment began . When the stopper was partly removed ? a difficult operation , because of the partial vacuum inside the pelican ? a hissing rush of outside air into the flask proved that no outside air had entered while the experiment was going on . This fact , combined with the equivalence of weight before and after. , indicated conclusively to Lavoisier that neither air nor any other external @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grayish flakes . Whence , then , - came these flakes ? Obviously they had come either from the transmutaAntoine // tion of water into earth which was hypothesized by the chemist Le Roy or from the pelican 's glass walls . Chemin 's delicately balanced scales would say which , and Lavoisier promptly appealed to them . After emptying very carefully all the water and earth from the pelican and drying the latter , he weighed it and found that it had lost 174/10 grains of weight . He then dried the gray flakes , placed them in the scales , and found that they weighed 4%10 grains . There was a difference of 125/10 grains between the weight lost by the pelican and the weight of the flakes . What accounted for it ? Probably this difference was the weight of glass material that remained still in solution , thought Lavoisier . This probability was increased when he tested the experimental water with his hydrometer and found it had a higher density than that of the distilled Seine water from which his experimental sample had been originally drawn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evaporated most of it , transferring what remained to a flat glass dish , wherein he carried the evaporation to dryness . Sure enough , there was a residue of gray flakes ! When he placed them on the scales , however , he found that they more than made up the weight difference for which he was trying to account : They weighed 155/.0 grains , instead of 125/10 , or precisely 3 grains more than tb.ey h ? uldhave . Lavoisier realized almost at once that the increase of 3 grains , far from being a contradiction of his hypothetical explanation , was a further confirmation . He had poured the experimental water into a glass vessel , he had evaporated it in glass vessels , and according to his hypothesis , some of this glass material must dissolve into the water and remain as residue after evaporation was complete . Hence , the extra 3 grains . This experiment , although it now seems to be of a childish simplicity , was of major importance to science if only // because it developed the essential type of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all laboratory chemistry . It was absolutely conclusive in its own terms . It proved what Lavoisier had initially assumed to be true ? namely , that repeated distillations do not change the Mature or properties of water , either by transmuting it into earth or by so " refining " it that it passes through the pores of glass ( a theory then widely held ) and that distilled water may therefore be used as a standard substance , provided the distillation process is carried out in containers that are not water-soluble . ( That glass is slightly water-soluble was also proved . ) But the experiment 's greater , more fundamental importance lay , to repeat , in the type which it modeled ? a type that insists on a rigorous and exclusive quantitativeness or , in other words , on the translation of all qualities into number readings on a quantitative scale . Whatever actually exists in the world as an object of scientific study is measurable in quantitative terms , and its accurate measurement is a sine qua non of the experimental method . Although it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a memoir received by the secretary of the Academy on May 10 of that year , Lavoisier 's water experiment was not formally reported to the world until November 14 , 1770 . He read his memoir to a public meeting of the Academy on that date . The eighteen-month delay was caused by the secretary 's wish to avoid undue public embarrassment of the distinguished Le Roy , whose memoir of 1767 , now to a large degree discredited by Lavoisier 's work , had been presented at a rentree publique of the Academy ( hence , Lavoisier 's insistence that he be permitted to do the same ) but was still unpublished in 1769 . Indeed , the slowness of the publication of Academy transactions was a continuing source of frustration and irritaAntoine // tion to scientists in those days ; often two or three years intervened between the initialing of a memoir by the secretary and its appearance in print . Meanwhile , Lavoisier was attacking the water problem on another front , that of sanitary and hydraulic engineering . An engineer , named De Parcieux , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply , and when he died in 1768 , his proposals were taken up and strongly pressed by Lavoisier . " One is alarmed when one realizes that the inhabitants of this great capital are nourished on water carted from the Seine on the backs of men or beasts , " he wrote in an article published in the Mercure de France . " The scarcity of water contributes enormously to uncleanliness of person and unhealthful air . " When the proposals were publicly ridiculed , Lavoisier defended them so persuasively in a paper presented to the Academy that the city government adopted them ; this action had no practical effect for a couple of decades , because of the chronic shortage of public money . The shortage also militated against the practical adoption of Lavoisier 's proposal to establish a system of pumps whereby water would be available in sufficient amounts and at sufficient pressures to be used in the fighting of fires . In 1771 he presented to the Academy a paper in which he calculated , from barometric readings taken at various levels of the city and from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steam pump for the Paris water supply . He was also actively interested at this time in the problem of what happens to diamonds when they are heated ? a problem that led him directly into a consideration of the problem of combustion in general , whose solution was to constitute his great , his revolutionary , achievement . For a century it had been repeatedly observed that diamonds were apparently destroyed when strongly heated , but it was not known whether the process was one of evaporation // or combustion or crackling disintegration into particles . Lavoisier , in collaboration with two other investigators , proposed to find out , making precise use of his balancing scales , of course . The three men first established definitely that strongly heated in air , a diamond did lose weight and polish . They then proceeded to test the theory of a jeweler , named Maillard , who was convinced that the apparent evaporation of the diamond would not occur when it was heated in the absence of air . Using three diamonds furnished by Maillard for the purpose , Lavoisier and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Placed in a clay pipe that was first filled with powdered charcoal and then sealed , the diamonds were intensely heated for several hours without any loss of weight or polish . This work was reported to the Academy in a paper read on April 29 , 1772 . The three men were now joined by a fourth person in an effort to determine precisely what happened when the diamond was heated in air . They obtained for this purpose the use of a great burning glass , the lens of Tschirnhausen , which had come to the Academy from the Duc d'Orleans and had been formerly used by scientists who were investigating the effect of heat on metals . This lens and another lens ( also made by Baron Tschirnhausen ) lent by a French nobleman were set up in August , 1772 , in the Jardin de 1'Infante , where full advantage could be taken of the noonday sun to produce at the lens ' focus the highest temperatures which men could achieve at that time . The studies made then and continued in October of the following year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common with many other combustibles ? charcoal , whale oil , spirits of wine , and candles ? because when it was heated in a confined ? hence measurable ? volume of ordinary air , it diminished the volume of the latter , while in the process of being itself " reduced " to " fixed air . " Two // tests showed the air above the " reduced " diamond to be " fixed " ? to be the same , in other words , as the air with which Joseph Priestley was " impregnating " water that same year . One was the addition of limewater to it : A precipitate of powdered chalk was produced . The other was the introduction of a lighted candle to it : The flame was extinguished as promptly as if it had been snuffed between thumb and forefinger . These conclusions about the combustion of diamonds derived not only from the diamond experiments of August , 1772 , and October , 1773 , but also from experiments with the combustion of phosphorus and sulfur conducted in September and October , 1772 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? a theory of the nature of combustion in general . Early in 1773 he initiated a long series of experiments deliberately designed to develop and test his theory , which , he predicted in a notebook entry for February 20 of that year , was " destined to bring about a revolution in physics and chemistry . " What he learned from these studies affected the conclusions he finally drew from and about the diamond experiments . Lavoisier could not complete his revolutionary theory , however , until a crucial piece of factual information , hitherto missing , was supplied by Joseph Priestley in the autumn of 1774 and the spring of 1775. 3 . Priestley the Experimenter Fire and Air : The Quantitative Approach of English Chemists To appreciate Joseph Priestley 's remarkable experimental work in his laboratory at Bowood , some knowledge of the development of chemistry to that time is required . As the Introduction to this book records , mechanistic theory had scored a seemingly absolute triumph in virtually every field of knowledge as the eighteenth century opened . Kepler , Galileo , and Newton had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of which ? the largest , as well as the smallest ? operated according to mechanical laws . It followed that the terms of mechanism were the only ones in which any problem could be truly stated and solved , whether that problem was of man and his society or of the natural world around him . Such was the deep-seated belief , the all-pervasive assumption , in leading minds . But this triumph of mechanism was absolute , or seemingly so , only in the realm of general theory . In the realm of 93 // particular practice the terms of mechanism were very unevenly applied among the various fields of knowledge , or classes of problems . They were rigorously and universally applied to the problems of physics and astronomy , the fields in which the terms had been originally defined ; they were very loosely and partially applied to the problems of medicine and chemistry ( chemistry was then largely the handmaiden of medicine ) , with the result that these fields remained weird mixtures of precise knowledge , vague speculation , and magical nonsense . Whereas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physics from theology and metaphysics , eighteenth-century chemistry was very imperfectly divorced from medieval alchemy and the cosmology of the Greek philosophers . The picturesque but hopelessly unsystematic nomenclature of alchemy continued to be employed ? chemical substances still went by such names as " oil of vitriol , " " powder of Algaroth , " " salt of alembroth , " " flowers of zinc , " and " butter of antimony " ? and chemical theory still embraced , in various ways and to varying degrees , the four " elements " of Empedocles ( circa 440 B.c. ) ; namely , fire , earth , air , and water . There were few unambiguous definitions of the things and processes which chemistry purported to explain or describe . Chaos reigned over the field . But not altogether : There was a segment where order prevailed as the Age of Reason opened , and for this the pioneering work of Robert Boyle was largely responsible . Boyle , the seventh son of the Earl of Cork , was one of the founders of the Royal Society , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physics , scoring his successes in the former field by applying to it the mechanistic principles defined in the latter . Boyle made several additions to the body of specific chemical knowledge . He discovered methyl alcohol , and he prepared copper chloride by applying mercuric chloride to copper ( to use modern // nomenclature rather than that available to Boyle ) . He also observed that iron filings treated with a mineral acid yielded a highly flammable " air " ? the earliest recorded observation of hydrogen . But by far his greatest contribution to chemical science was in essence a philosophical one in the tradition of Francis Bacon , who profoundly influenced him . In The Sceptical Chyrnist ( published first in 1661 ) Boyle heaped ridicule on the ambiguities , inconsistencies , and pretensions of the chemists of his day while issuing a clarion call for precise definitions and close reasoning . He complained of the " unreasonable liberty " chemists gave themselves " of playing with names at pleasure . " He scorned their incapacity for plain , unequivocal statements . He more than suspected that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notions too precious to be explained , but because they fear that if they were explained , men would discern that they are far from being precious . " Of course , " they can not write otherwise than confusedly of what they but confusedly apprehend , " but he hoped that " judicious men skilled in chymical affairs " would " agree to write clearly and plainly of them , and thereby keep men from being stunned ... or imposed upon by dark and empty words . " Those who could not write in this way might then be discouraged from writing at all and so cease " to trouble the world with riddles and impertinencies . " Boyle was especially critical of the failure of chemists to define clearly the key term " element " ? a failure which rendered meaningless the conceptions of " mixtures " and " compounds . " His own definition laid a cornerstone of chemical science and also anticipated , if it did not actually help shape , the distinction between " primary " and " secondary " qualities made in John Locke 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boyle held the world to be made of one " Catholick or Universal Matter , " // which was divided into infinitesimal fragments ? atoms , cor-puscles ? having size and shape and local motion . These were minima or prima naturalia in his Latin terminology , and they came together in primary clusters , which were the smallest units into which a perfectly homogeneous chemical substance could be broken down . Variations in the microscopic local motions of these primary clusters determined the seemingly infinite diversity of objects , each of which possessed in itself definite size and shape and other primary qualities that impressed on perceiving minds such effects ? secondary qualities ? as color , temperature , and odor . The primary clusters varied in kind , and each kind constituted what Boyle called an " element . " " I must advertise to you , " he wrote , " that I now mean by Elements . . . certain primitive and simple , or perfectly unmingled bodies which not being made of any other bodies ... are the ingredients of which all those called perfectly mixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultimately resolved . " Or to put it an-other way : " I must not look upon any body as a true principle or element , but as yet compounded , which is not perfectly homogeneous , but is further resoluble into any number of distinct substances , how small soever . " While yet in his early twenties , in collaboration with Robert Hooke ( 1635-1703 ) , whom he had hired to build an improved air pump , Boyle conducted a series of funda-mental experiments on what he called " the spring mean-ing the elasticity of air . " They were experiments whose implicit assumption was Newton 's third law , which asserts that for every action there is an equal and opposite reac-tion . In the cylinder of the pump , which Boyle termed his " pneumatical engine , " a precisely measurable pressure could be exerted by the piston on a precisely measurable volume of air , enabling Boyle to discern an inversely pro-portionate relationship between the two measurements . // When he doubled the pressure , the volume was halved . His general conclusion , still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the basic equations of physics : P refers to the smaller pressure and V to the volume of an ideal gas under this pressure , and PI refers to the greater pressure and VI to the volume of ideal gas under this pres sure . Thus was prepared the way for experiments in pneu matic chemistry wherein an investigator might partially infer the nature of a chemical reaction from its effect in increasing or decreasing an initially given volume of air ( gas ) kept at a constant temperature and pressure . Boyle and Hooke also determined that when a bell is rung inside . a jar from which the air has been evacuated , no sound issues ; that insects and animals can not live ? nor can a candle burn ? in the absence of air ; and that gun-powder burns as well in a vacuum as in air . The last two ? observations led them to conclude that " something " in the air which is necessary to combustion and the respiration of animals ? phenomena evidently related in kind to each other ? is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ingredient of gunpowder . ( Saltpeter is potassium nitrate , KNO3. nce ordin y.air was ... not an element , as ... cleined by Boyle ; it was not a perfectly homogeneous substance but , instead , a mixture . Hooke said so explicitly in early 1667 , asserting that " the dissolution of sulphurous bodies is made by a substance inherent , and mixt with the Air , that is like , if not the very same , with that which is fixt in Salt-Peter . " In other words , what the saltpeter gave up when it burned was precisely what the " sulphurous bodies " took up when they burned . The connection between respiration and combustion was still more closely made during the next two years by // John Mayow ( 1643-79 ) , a physician in Bath who was led by the Boyle-Hooke experiments to make investigations of his own along the same lines . ( Mayow became a Fellow of the Royal Society in the year before his early death . ) It had been known by the natural philosophers of ancient Alexandria that when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water , the water level rises steadily in the vessel until the candle goes out , the level remaining constant thereafter . Mayow substituted a live mouse for a candle and found that essentially the same thing happened : The water level rose until the mouse died , then remained stationary . He also discovered that when a mouse and a lighted candle were placed together in a closed container of air , the candle went out first , and then the mouse died ; but that a mouse lived twice as long in the container if no lighted candle was placed beside it there . Mayow then devised an experiment to test Hooke 's conclusion that the " substance " enabling gunpowder to burn in a vacuum was the same as that which , " mixt with the Air , " enabled " sulphurous bodies " to burn . In enclosed air in which a candle had been burnt to extinction or a mouse had breathed until it died of suffocation , he burnt gunpowder and found that the foul enclosed air was restored : A candle would again burn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He inferred that air is indeed a mixture of two kinds of particle , only one of which is active in the support of fire and of breathing . He called this kind nitro-aerial because such particles were present both in niter and in " good " air . The next step toward a recognition of the nature of combustion was taken by Boyle . In a pamphlet describing his " new experiments , " issued in 1673 , he told how he had weighed a piece of tin , heated it until it became what was then called a calx ( an oxide ) , and , then as a last step , weighed the calx . He found the latter was heavier than the // original tin . From the fact that the weight increase re sulted from the application of heat , he inferred that heat must be a " ponderable matter " that had united with the tin to form the calx . The experiment showed , said he , " that ' it is possible to render the parts of fire stable and ponderable " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the great merit of emphasizing the impor tance of weight measurements in chemical experiment and of describing combustion as a process of combination or addition , rather than of reduction or subtraction. * It had also the merit , inadvertent on Boyle 's part , of stimulating experiments along the same line by Mayow , who concluded that the weight increase that occurred when he heated tin with a burning lens was due to the addition to the tin , not of " heat " or " parts of fire , " but of the nitro-aerial particles whose existence he had inferred from his earlier observations . Further study of what we now call " gases " ( a term first used by Jan Baptista van Helmont 1577 ? - 1644 , who de-rived it from the Greek word for " chaos " ) and of what Englishmen in Priestley 's time continued to call " airs " was inhibited in the late seventeenth century by the fact that no adequate method of collecting and storing them had been devised . Mayow , it is true , employed a primitive spe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this important piece of chemical laboratory equipment was not made until 1726 , when Stephen Hales ( 1677-1761 ) first // used it to collect and store an " inflammable air " produced by the burning of Newcastle coal . Hales , a clergyman who became a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1717 and a winner of its Copley Medal in 1739 , has been called the " father of vegetable physiology . " He conducted fundamental researches into the ways in which plants use water , accomplishing the difficult feat of measurPriestley // ing their rates of imbibition and respiration , and he was led by these researches to inquire specifically into the nature of " air . " As he put it in his Vegetable Staticks ( published in 1727 ) : " Having produced many Experiments , to prove that the Air is plentifully inspired by Vegetables , not only at their roots , but also thro ' several parts of their trunks and branches . . . this put me upon making a more particular inquiry into the nature of a Fluid which is so absolutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Animals and Vegetables . " Using quantitative methods , he studied the respiration of animals , repeating with improving modifications " Dr. Mayow 's Experiment , to find out how much air is absorbed by the breath of Animals inclosed in glasses " and to compare this absorption with that of a burning candle . He also made " an Attempt to analyse the Air , by a great variety of Chymio-Statical Experiments , " to quote the descriptive subtitle he gave Vegetable Staticks . He produced gaseous ammonia by heating sal ammoniac with lime , he attributed to the " addition " of some substance the weight increase of lead calcined into red lead , and he described combustion as the " action and reaction of the aerial and sulphurous particles . " He did not , however , recognize the existence of different kinds of " air . " He continued to regard atmospheric air as a single substance , a true element whose different properties ? as in gaseous ammonia , coal gas , and the expired breath of animals ? were due wholly to " impurities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an original illustration from Vegetable Staticks , greatly facilitated his studies of " the Air " in general . But his use of water in the trough prevented his noticing any gas ( or " property " of " impure " air , as he might initially have said ) which was water-soluble . Had he used mercury , instead of water in his trough , as Priestley was to do , he // might have gained the distinction of discovering " fixed air . " Indeed , Mayow before him might have done so had Mayow inverted his glass vessel enclosing a burning candle over mercury , instead of over water . The " fixed air " produced by the candle is insoluble in mercury but highly soluble in water , as we saw in the case of Priestley 's " soda water . " Hence , there would have been no rise in the level of the liquid mercury within the enclosing vessel as the candle burned to extinction , the gaseous pressure on the liquid surface inside remaining the same as the atmos pheric pressure on the liquid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure over water and " air " pressure over mercury , in these circumstances , could hardly have failed to stimulate so acute an observer as Mayow , and so // ingenious an experimenter , to inquire successfully into the reason for it . But all this lies in the realm of unrealized possibility . In the actual event , the distinction of proving that the earth 's atmosphere is a mixture , rather than a single element , was gained by Joseph Black ( 1728-99 ) , whose crucial experiments , which are generally believed to have become the model for Lavoisier 's , entitle him to be called the founder of quantitative pneumatic chemistry . Black was born of Scottish parents in Bordeaux , France , where his father was at the time engaged in the wine trade . He went to school in Belfast , Ireland , and he studied medicine and chemistry at the University of Glasgow and the University of Edinburgh , in Scotland , in both of which he later taught these subjects . It was a specific medical problem that led him into his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1754 , he began his experiments with quicklime , magnesia alba ( magnesium carbonate , MgCO3 ) , and other alkaline substances , he was in search of a more powerful agent than was then available for the dissolution of the stones that sometimes form in the human urinary bladder . This initial and specific interest did not , however , blind him to the significance of the remarkable weight equivalents he soon discovered through his unprecedentedly precise use of the balance at every stage of his investigation . It had long been known that when limestone is strongly heated ( calcined ) , it is transformed into quicklime , or produces quicklime , which is caustic ? that is , capable of burning human flesh . It had also long been known that , in general , mild alkalies can be rendered caustic through treatment with limewater . Although magnesia alba was regarded by Black as a mild alkali and perhaps even as a species of limestone at the outset of his experiments , he found that a treatment of it with limewater produced no // caustic solution . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heating it strongly . He was astonished to find that it lost a full seven-twelfths of its weight through such heating . When he tested the five-twelfths of residue , he found that it dissolved in the same common acids as did the original magnesia alba and produced , in interaction with such acids , the same salts ( compounds of acids and metal , as we now know ) . But this residue did not effervesce in the process of dissolution ? as did the original magnesia alba ? nor did it precipitate limewater . His next effort was to explain experimentally the missing weight . Something had been lost . What was it ? He heated a precisely weighed sample of magnesia alba in a retort from which he could collect the issuing vapors . The vapors condensed into liquid water , which , he found , accounted for but a small part of the total weight loss . The difference , he concluded , must be the weight of an uncondensable " air , " whose loss was also indicated by the fact that the original sample effervesced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He then calcined another precisely weighed sample of magnesia alba ; weighed the calx , recording the precise weight loss ; dissolved this calx in " oil of vitriol " ( sulfuric acid , H2SO4 ) ; and reprecipitated it as a solid powder by adding alkali to the acid solution . Carefully collecting the precipitate , he weighed it and found it precisely the same weight as the original sample ( precisely , that is , within the smallest possible margin of experimental error ) and to have the same general properties : It effervesced in acids , and it precipitated limewater . Evidently it was again ordinary magnesia alba . Black concluded that the " air " which had been lost through heating was restored by the precipitating alkali ? a confirmation of Hales ' observation that alkaline salts when acted on by acids give up an " air " that is " fixed " in them . Further confirming experiments were then devised by // Black . He took a precisely weighed quantity of pure fixed alkaline salt ( sodium carbonate , Na2CO3 ) and mixed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of vitriol . He found the mixture weighed less than the combined weights of the original ingredients . Approximately the same thing happened when lie saturated oil of vitriol with magnesia : This mixture , too , lost weight . But when he calcined precisely the same amount of magnesia , weighed the calx , and dissolved it in diluted oil of vitriol , he found that the weight of the solution equaled the combined weights of calx and acid . There was no weight loss . Moreover , approximately the same amount of acid was required to dissolve the calx of an ounce of magnesia as that required to dissolve the original ounce . Thus , all experimental evidence confirmed Black 's conclusion that the difference between uncalcined and calcined magnesia was due to the " considerable quantity of air " present in the former and absent from the latter . It was due to what he called " fixed air , " borrowing the term first used by Hales . Nor did Black stop there . He experimented with chalk and found that heating it to make quicklime resulted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ release of the same kind of " fixed air " as that which resulted from the calcination of magnesia . He found , too , that when acid was poured over chalk , " fixed air " bubbled through the solvent and could be collected in a container inverted over it . He was enabled to make some study ( although ill health prevented his making a detailed one ) of the nature and properties of this gas , which is now known as carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) . He found that it would not support combustion ( nothing would burn in its presence alone ) ; that it occurred as a small constituent of atmospheric air and could be removed by bubbling air through limewater , forming a chalky precipitate in such water ; that it was a product of the fermentation of beer ; that it was a product // of the combustion of charcoal ; and that it was expired from the lungs as a man breathed . The specific knowledge thus gained was of major im portance in the history of science . So was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same sort might be made . Of at least equal historical importance was the fact that Black 's work struck the first heavy blow against a false theory of burning that dominated chemical thinking in his time ? a theory he himself accepted ( insofar as he accepted any general theory ) and continued to hold even after his blow against it had been delivered . The Phlogiston Theory : The Speculative Approach of Continental Chemists This theory was initially the work of a German , Johann Joachim Becher ( 1635-82 ) , who lived as a contemporary of Boyle , Hooke , and Mayow ( he was born in the same year as Hooke ) but who was not in any close correspond ence with them and whose approach to chemical problems was very different from theirs . Hooke 's pregnant experi mental inference in 1667 showed that saltpeter has in common with atmospheric air a " substance " necessary for " the dissolution of sulphurous bodies . " Mayow 's imme diately following work showed not only that an animal 's breathing and a candle 's burning are chemically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can he made " good " through the burning of saltpeter in it . An interesting his torical coincidence is the fact that Mayow was conducting the latter experiments , which pointed clearly in the right direction , in the very year ( 1669 ) that Becher published his Physica Subterranea , which pointed , if far less clearly , in the wrong direction . Becher had no such penchant for exact quantitative observation , using rigorously objective measurements , as // that which Boyle and Boyle 's followers manifested in Eng land . His was a speculative , rather than an experimental , mind . Moreover , as a scientific theorist , he possessed grave weaknesses : He was addicted to the classifying habit of mind ( like Aristotle 's ) , deducing consequences from clas sifying statements , and he failed to practice the consistency of basic definition which Boyle called for in The Sceptical Chymist . Nevertheless , some historians of science assert that he deserves honor for suggesting the first " rational " theory of combustion and that the general effect of his theory , at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress of chemistry . Becher 's theory , briefly stated , was as follows : Combustion is a process of decomposition ; it is the dis solution of the combustible body into its constituents . From this it follows that no simple body , consisting of a single substance , is combustible , for it has no parts into which it can be decomposed . But not every composite body is combustible . Combustion is a specific effect , and every such effect must have a specific cause . Hence , every combustible body possesses , as the cause of its combusti bility , a " something " which Becher called terra pinguis or " oily earth " ( " fatty earth " ) . This is expelled from the body during combustion , and only " stony " or " vitreous " earth is left behind . Some combustibles contain more terra pinguis than others , a fact " explaining " their greater combustibility . The mineral substances that are combus tible contain , in general , very little . Charcoal , on the other hand , is almost pure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slight amount of ash when it burns . But it was not as Becher left it that the theory achieved its enormous fame and influence . For the latter develop ment the credit belongs to Becher 's pupil and follower , Georg Ernst Stahl ( 1660-1734 ) . It was Stahl who substituted for the term terra pinguis the word " phlogiston , " which // ( ironically ) he borrowed from Boyle 's masterpiece of 1661 , the book in which Boyle inveighed against chemists ' " play ing with names , " and it is with Stahl 's name that the phlogiston doctrine is primarily associated in history . The theory " formed the groundwork of chemical research for the next fifty years , " wrote James Campbell Brown in his History of Chemistry , " dominated the minds of philoso pliers for a hundred years , and was the outstanding fact of chemical history in the eighteenth century . " z When Priest-ley was first introduced to chemistry , " the doctrine of Stahl " was universally considered , as he later wrote , to be the greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Priestley himself had a reverential regard for it in the 1770 's , as he conducted his experiments at Bowood . So did nearly all other chemists . Lavoisier , depositing a sealed note with the secretary of the Academy of Science on November 1 , 1772 , said that he did so to protect his right to a " discovery appearing to me one of the most interesting of those that have been made since the time of Stahl , " indicating his view that Stahl 's , up to that time , was the greatest name in chemistry . That this should be so appears to present-day eyes one of the curiosities of intellectual history , for Stahl 's own statements of his doc trine are so ambiguous in their meaning ? so hopelessly confused in respect to " matter , " " essence , " and " principle , " none of which is clearly defined ? as to render them essen tially unintelligible . His clearest statements are to the effect that phlogiston is the principle of combustibility . But this , standing alone , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ com bustibility " of " combustibility . " In other statements the " principle " becomes " material " ? an actual ingredient of combustible bodies , as Becher had held " oily " earth to be . " It is to be kept in mind , " Stahl wrote , " that as well in // the fat with which one smears his shoes , as in the sulphur of the mines and all metals that are partly or wholly combustible , there is actually the same essence ( or principle ) which gives and constitutes its inflammability . " His most widely quoted passage is almost incomprehensible : " Briefly , in the act of composition , as an instrument , there intervenes and is most potent , fire , flaming , fervent , hot ; but in the very substance of the compound there intervenes , as an ingredient , as it is commonly called , as a material principle and as a constituent part of the whole compound , the material and principle of fare , not fire itself . This I was the first to call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lamp will not burn in a closed vessel by asserting , on the basis of no experimental evidence at all , that phlogiston assumed a rapid / whirling motion , requiring much open space , as it was expelled from the burning body . Where there was insuffi-:w cient room for this motion , the phlogiston could not leave the combustible body ? that is to say , the body could not burn . A more sophisticated " explanation " was developed in the later phlogiston theory ; namely , the air has a limited capacity to absorb the fire principle and , when saturated , acts as a barrier to the escape of phlogiston . Fire will not burn in a thoroughly phlogisticated air because there is no place where more phlogiston can go . As for metals and their calxes , the phlogiston theory held the latter to be simpler in composition than the former . Iron , tin , and lead were deemed to be compounds of metal plus phlogiston . Their calxes were what was left after the phlogiston had been expelled through combustion . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the explanation thus made of the most familiar of the industrial chemical processes in Stahl 's time ; namely , the smelting of metallic ores to obtain the usable metal . // Consider , for instance , the smelting of iron ore ( iron oxide ) . According to the phlogiston theory , the ore is a substance lacking phlogiston . It is incombustible . But when this ore is mixed with charcoal and strongly heated , it becomes combustible . Why ? Because the ore absorbs phlogiston from the charcoal with which it is in contact , charcoal being almost pure phlogiston . The reaction is as follows : Iron ore + phlogiston ? ) metallic iron The theory seemed also to explain what happens when lime is burnt and when mild alkalies are made caustic through contact with slaked lime . In both cases , said the theory , there is a transfer of phlogiston : The burnt lime becomes caustic when phlogiston from the fire pours into it ; potash and soda become caustic when phlogiston from the slake lime pours into them , leaving mild lime behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ + ( mild lime + phlogiston ) ? ) ( mild alkali  --  phlogiston ) + mild lime Joseph Black 's experiments can not be said actually to have disproved the phlogiston hypothesis as it applied to magnesia , lime , potash , and soda . Phlogiston might indeed play the part it was alleged to play in the above reaction . But there was no evidence that it did so or even that it existed . If it did , the scales gave no sign of it . It must indeed be as weightless as an idea ? a superfluous idea at that , since the facts could be fully explained without it . There was so perfect a correlation between ( a ) the presence or absence of fixed air in precisely measurable amounts and ( b ) the changes in causticity and in the capacity to effervesce in acids as to imply a causal connection between ( a ) and ( b ) . The causticity of lime was evidently caused by the loss of fixed air . The restoration of // mildness to lime was evidently caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to assume that phlogiston entered at all into the transaction . But Black 's resort to the balance for clues to the nature of chemical reactions and his use of it as a final arbiter of laboratory truth or error were not widely imitated in England , and still less so on the Continent , during the two decades immediately following his great experiments . The phlogiston theory continued to be accepted as true by virtually all chemists , who deemed it as fundamental to their science as Newton 's laws of mechanics were to physics . The embarrassing fact that metallic calxes weigh more than the original metal was largely ignored , along with the fact that no calx is formed of metals heated in a vacuum . Even when the weight-change problem had at last to be faced squarely the theory found resourceful defenders . They sought to remove the difficulty by endowing the formerly weightless fire principle with the very opposite of weight . Ancient Greek philosophers , from the observation that flames always rise , had concluded that fire has the property of levity ( lightness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some of them , reached the same conclusion.4 Phlogiston . t1iP . 1 ? 7 1nraPPra nnccacc levity , the opposite of gravies . Ithad negative weight , . - Hence , when phlogiston was added to a substance , as in the smelting of iron , the substance lost weight . When phlogiston was removed from a substance , as in the formation of iron calx , the substance gained weight . Such speculative ingenuity foundered on the fact that a negative weight should be as definitely measurable in a balance as a positive one , and no measure of it appeared in quantitative experiment . Indeed , in the light of such an experiment , a phlogiston endowed with levity was quickly seen to be less satisfactory by far than a phlogiston possessing no weight at all . Every weight change in Black 's // experiments , for instance , was fully accounted for by the gain or loss of fixed air . The data left no single gap into which a " negative mass " of phlogiston might be inserted . The " Experimentarian Philosopher " Joseph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to work in the laboratory he established in a room at one end of the long library at Bowood . This is not remarkable : There was at the time no alternative general theory against which the phlogiston doctrine might be measured . But it is remarkable that Priestley remained a phlogistonist ? and an ardent one ? even after his greatest discovery had led directly to the development of a new general theory , one that gained almost universal acceptance before he died . Among the last of his scientific pub-lications was a pamphlet , entitled Considerations on the Doctrine of Phlogiston , and on the Decomposition of Water , which was issued in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , in 1796 . In it he warmly defended the " doctrine of Stahl " against " what is now usually termed the new system of chemistry , or that of the Antiphlogistians . " The fact that " we are not able to ascertain the weight of phlogiston " was , he admitted , a " difficulty " of the old theory . " But neither do any of its pretend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though we do not doubt that they are properly substances capable by their addition , or abstrac-tion , of making great changes in the properties of bodies , and of being transmitted from one substance to another . " All this adds up to one of the famous ironies in the history of science . It is also a psychological significant irony . This is the reason that it is mentioned here before // the work from which the irony springs has been described . For it should be emphasized that as a man of science , Priestley was " timorous " and " conservative " ? in the words of T. E. Thorpe s ? only in the realm of general theory . In the realm of particular facts he was bold and often marvelously ingenious . Moreover , it is an open question whether he could have contributed to science as richly as he was now about to do , had his been a theoretical system-building mind . The possessors of such minds often incline toward a kind of intellectual arrogance joined to an excessively inhibiting self-criticism ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serves to check since its essence is a fear of being caught in humiliating error . Such men often lack the humility of mind ? the humble willingness to submit their minds wholly to external fact ? which is necessary for swiftly accurate observations of the natural world . There are , after all , two general ways of science ? one empirical ( i.e. , experimental in a hit-or-miss fashion ) , the other systematic . Both are necessary in the development of scientific knowledge , neither is wholly exclusive of the other at any stage of the development , but the importance of the empirical , compared with the systematic , is greatly diminished as a science progresses from youth to maturity . " In the historical order of the development of a science , " writes Arthur Pap , " the first step usually consists in the experimental verification of various logically independent laws ; this body of laws is thereafter systematized by a comprehensive theory . " ' To put it another way , experience is a precondition of wisdom , in a developing science as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observations may be predicted , can not be shaped until a multitude of past observations is recorded . Now Priestley , operating as a pioneer in pneumatic chemistry , was the empirical researcher par excellence . As // has been said , his function was to accumulate through more or less random observations ? carefully made , precisely reported ? the raw materials , the " brute facts , " out of which genuine scientific knowledge might be manufac tured . His Success in this enterprise required an ability to recognize the significant fact , and this in turn required his possession of at least rudimentary theories or hypoth eses which might measure relative significance . His grasp of these , however , was slight : It is a paradoxical but prob ably true statement that he would have abandoned the phlogiston doctrine very soon , as a result of his own dis coveries , had he grasped this theory and its implications more firmly , more completely . Theories in themselves ? scientific theories ? simply did not interest him very much , and he made small use of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Instead , he depended very largely on fortunate contingencies ( so-called " happy accidents " ) for his successes . In this he was like the solitary old-time prospector of the American West , who was trained to recognize precious ore when he saw it and who possessed some slight knowledge of the kind of rock formation in which ore of this sort was most likely to occur , but whose main reliance was on lucky chances as he roamed the wilderness . We have seen how the accident of Priestley 's having moved into a house in Leeds next door to a brewery , where an abundance of " fixed air " was available above the fer mentation vats , led him into his first experiments in pneu matic chemistry . These suggested further experiments , not in terms of an underlying theory or overall hypothesis , but directly , on a strictly ad hoc basic . One thing led to another until there had been formed " a web of experiments un interrupted by reasoning , " as Lavoisier later called it with some justification , if with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught and held a mass of useful , if unrelated , // facts ? more items of specific information than would have been gained in all likelihood by any man who insisted on organizing his external observations into an internally consistent body of knowledge . Priestley was willing to try anything in his laboratory , even things that appeared in the light of " reasoning " and earlier experiment to be certain of failure . For in-stance , by 1771 it had been established through experi ment and observation that air is as necessary to vegetable as to animal life . From this it was " reasonable " to conclude that vegetable respiration and animal respiration would // " use up " common air in the same way , rendering air unfit ' to support a candle 's flame or a mouse 's breathing . " I own I had that expectation when I first put a sprig of mint into a glass jar standing inverted over a vessel of water , " reported Priestley , " but when it had continued there for some months I found the air would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inconvenient to a mouse , which I put into it .... " This suggested that there was " something attending vegetation which restored air that had been injured by respiration " and that " the same process might also restore the air that had been injured by the burning of candles . " He went on : " Accordingly , on the 17th of August 1771 , I put a sprig of mint into a quantity of air in which a wax candle had burned out , and found that on the 27th of the same month another candle burned perfectly well in it . This experiment I repeated , without the least variation in the event , not less than eight or ten times in the remainder of the summer . " He then proceeded to test whether " this remarkable effect " depended on something " peculiar to mint , which was the plant I always made use of till July 1772 . " On July 16 " 1 found a quantity of this kind of air to be perfectly restored by sprigs of balm , which had grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The same thing happened when he tried other plants , although " the most effectual of any kind that I have tried for this purpose is spinach , which is of quick growth but will seldom thrive long in water . " His . final step was a series of experiments to T determin e . whether plant respiration was as effective in restoring . air Infected with Animal Respiration or Putrefaction " as it was in restoring " Air in which a Candle has burned out . " He found that it was , and he concluded that this was one of the methods whereby " Nature " prevented 11 the whole mass of the atmosphere " from becoming " in // time ... unfit for the purpose of animal life . " He cited a number of decisive experiments he conducted to prove 11 that.pj ; mts , instead . of affecting the air in- , , the sameman  - -  ner with animal - respiration , reverse  --  the effects of breathing and tend to keep the atmosphere . sweet and wholesome - whenit is . become noxious in consequence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putrefying in it . " s ( What he was here the first man to notice scientifically was , of course , an effect of the process now called " photosynthesis . " In the presence of light the chlorophyll or green stuff in the leaves of plants uses the carbon of carbon dioxide , which it takes from the air , to make carbohydrates . Free oxygen is thereby released to the atmosphere . ) Simultaneously with these experiments , Priestley conducted others that were related to them , in his mind , only by the fact that they too dealt with air . Some of these other experiments were suggested by Hales ' essays . Hales had observed that when air was confined above a paste formed of sulfur , iron filings , and water , its volume was notably reduced ; evidently the paste absorbed some of the air . Priestley , repeating this experiment , found that about a fifth of the air 's volume was thus absorbed and that the residual air was lighter than common air , would not support animal life , and produced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not " fixed air " ) . We now know that this residual " air " was almost wholly nitrogen , which makes up approximately four-fifths of the earth 's atmosphere , and it is possible that Priestley , as a result of this and subsequent experiments , would have recognized it as a distinct and separate " air " had his mental vision not been blinkered by the phlogiston theory . The theory told him , however , that this residual air was as it was because it had become filled with phlogiston ; it had become " phlogisticated " from the metal filings , which were calcined . Hales had also treated iron pyrites with " spirit of niter " // ( nitric acid , HNO3 ) and found that there was generated an " air " which , mingled with common air , formed a thick I red . cloud . It appeared to Hales that there was " an equal diminution " in the volumes of the two airs as they interacted over water in his pneumatic trough . Priestley , who said that he was " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eager to repeat the experiment but had at hand no pyrites . He finally proceeded on the assumption , suggested by a fellow scientist , that the peculiar " air " derived from the " spirit of niter , " rather than from the pyrites . The assumption proved correct . He applied the " spirit " to several different metals ? iron , copper , and silver ? and found that in each case there was produced the peculiar new " air . " That it was new and distinctive he proved through a series of experiments designed to test its properties . He named it " nitrous air , " confessing that although he did not " altogether like the term , " neither he nor his friends had " been able to hit upon a better . " We now call it nitric oxide ( NO ) . He observed more precisely than Hales had been able to do the reduction in volume that occurred when " nitrous air " was mixed with common air over water to produce the red fumes . He found that the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common air , and as much of the nitrous air as is necessary to produce that effect ; which , as I have found by many trials , is about one half as much as the original quantity of common air . " In other words , he found that the maximum reduction occurred when he mixed 1 volume of the new " air " with 2 volumes of the " best " available atmospheric air . The reduction in this case was astonishingly large . Within a few minutes the original 3 volumes ? 1 of " nitrous " air and 2 of the " best " common air ? were reduced to approximately 1.8 volumes , or 10 percent less than the volume of the atmospheric air alone before the " nitrous air " was added to it . " I hardly // know of any experiment that is more adapted to amaze and surprise than this , which exhibits a quantity of air which , as it were , devours a quantity of another kind of air half as large as itself , and yet is so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerably diminished by it .... " He further observed ( a ) that although the colorless " nitrous air " was not soluble in water , the red fumes , which we know as nitrogen dioxide ( NO2 ) , were highly water-soluble ; ( b ) that the red fumes were not formed when " nitrous air " was mixed with confined air in which a candle had burned until its flame had gone out ; and ( c ) that the diminution in the combined volumes of " nitrous air " and common air varied with the " goodness " of the latter ? that is , with the ability to support life and fire . The " better " the air , the greater the reduction of volume . The " best " air could be reduced by one-fifth . The " worst " air was not reduced at all : One volume of " nitrous air " added to two volumes of thoroughly " bad " air produced three volumes of mixture . Evidently ( thought Priestley ) the formation and dissolving of the red fumes removed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was free of phlogiston ( dephlogisticated ) , leaving that which was saturated with phlogiston . Hence , " nitrous air " could be used to test " the goodness of air ... much more accurately than can be done by putting mice or any other animals to breathe in it . " It was this " nitrous air " test which helped Priestley make his greatest discovery . Meanwhile , he continued to play with his new " air " in the laboratory . When he brought it into contact with metallic iron , he found that " a most remarkable and unexpected change was made " in it . Not only would a candle now burn in it , but also the candle burned with a flame " twice as large as it is naturally , and sometimes not less than five or six times larger . " In other words , the action
