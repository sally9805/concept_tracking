THE INSIDE TRACK // Baseball 's interleague trading session begins November 20 , runs through December 15 . American League expansion ( to 10 teams ) will scramble the pieces even more than usual , but look for these names  --  and situations  --  to make trading headlines : // ? Dodgers ( loaded with promising youngsters ) will sell or trade Gil Hodges and Duke Snider while they still have market value . // ? Giants will trade discontented Johnny Antonelli , most probably to Yanks or Reds , try to land an above-average catcher ( like Yanks ' Elston Howard or John Blanchard ) and steady shortstop ( like Reds ' Roy McMillan ) . // ? Orioles need strong young outfielder who can hit with power , will send Pitchers Jack Fisher and Hal Brown to the National League in exchange for one . // ? Tigers ' new regime will shake up smug also-rans , try to peddle Pitcher Paul Foytack , Outfielder Charley Maxwell , maybe Second Baseman Frank Boiling . // ? Angry Braves will put Wes Covington , Johnny Logan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corner a first-rate second baseman . Best bet is a deal with Cleveland , which needs pitching badly and would like to send Johnny Temple back to the National League . // ? White Sox , along with Braves , will be most active in trading name players . Sox will part with anyone but Luis Aparicio and Nellie Fox , and Bill Veeck may ship away two power hitters he got just last year , Roy Sievers and Gene Freese. // ? Red Sox will offer Batting Champ Pete Runnels for an NL shortstop , will even relinquish " untouchable " Frank Malzone for a price . His replacement : Rookie phenom Carl Yastrzemski. // ? Phillies have no choice but to trade Gene Conley , who says he will not play for them any longer . For him and fading hero Robin Roberts , the Phils hope to get a couple of established major leaguers to steady a lineup of developing youngsters . // ? One trade that wo n't happen : Kansas City 's Bud Daley to the Yanks . In past years this would have been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But new KC owners will be working hard to erase the two clubs ' chummy reputation . // JUICY Guard Don Manoukian of the Oakland Raiders was asked by a waiter how rare he wanted his steak . Said Manoukian : " Just knock the breath out of it . " // SAY " AHHH " // When Forest Ranger Ed Moorehouse found a young moose leaning dispiritedly against a tree , he diagnosed the trouble right away : advanced dental decay . Moorehouse pried open the moose 's jaws to confirm his diagnosis . Then he gently led the animal to his truck . In his Upper Blackville , New Brunswick backyard , Moorehouse yanked out seven rotten teeth with his fingers . He first put his patient on a whole milk liquid diet , later added oak and dead cherry leaves . // The moose , a female , quickly regained her health and composure . She clowned around for visitors , showing her bare gums . When a sick moose regains his health , does he long for the freedom of the wild woods ? Moorehouse fears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be pushed out , became a showgirl , so to speak , in a New Brunswick government wildlife exhibit . // TARZAN IN VEGAS The tall man went out for an early-morning dip in the swimming pool of a Las Vegas hotel . A caretaker waved him back and said , " You ca n't swim without a lifeguard on duty . " // " Do n't you know who I am ? " said the tall one . // " No , " said the guard . " Who are you ? " // " I 'm the new lifeguard , " said Johnny Weissmuller and he plunged into the water . // THE MOSTEST // Not many people know it , but the brewers of Guinness stout also brew books . The fourth edition of The Guinness Book of Records , a Matter-horn of minutiae , is now on sale . Started as a promotion for Guinness and as a means of settling barroom arguments , the book has sold 500,000 copies to people who want to identify the " largest , oldest , smallest , richest , heaviest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , highest , slowest , mostest " of anything , e.g. : // ? The smallest full-grown fish ever caught was a Schindleria praematurus in Samoa . It weighed 1/14,000 of an ounce . // ? The shortest prizefight ever recorded took 10 ? seconds ( including a full count of 10 ) , when Al Couture struck Ralph Watson " while the latter was adjusting a gum shield in his corner . " // ? The lowest golf course in the world is the Sodom and Gomorrah Golfing Society at Kallia on the Dead Sea , 1,250 feet below sea level . // ? A snail 's pace is .000361 mph. to .03125 mph. // ? A flea in California jumped 13 inches in 1910 . High jump record is 7 inches . // ? The most brainless animal in history was the Stegosaurus . It weighed six tons , but its brain was only 2 ? ounces and " it was probably only dimly aware it was alive . " // A fellow who can not make money with this book does not know how to handle himself in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Percy Cerutty , the highly vocal and highly talented Australian track coach , thinks that someone someday will run the mile in 3:20 . Furthermore , says Cerutty , he may have the someone in hand . Cerutty 's choice : 9-year-old Ivor Caudle of Adelaide , Australia . // Cerutty ran into the Caudle family on shipboard in 1958 , when Ivor was a lean and compact child of 7 Cerutty invited the Caudles , father and son , to join him in trotting around the boat deck each dawn . Watching the loose-jointed Ivor loping alongside , Cerutty was impressed by the boy 's steady , even strides , his instinctive control of breathing and his calm temperament . He suggested that Papa Caudle , an orange grower , bring the boy to the Cerutty miler factory at Portsea . This was all the suggestion the Caudles needed , and since then they have shown up at every available opportunity . Says the Senior Caudle : " Perce can inspire young chaps . It is something more than technique . He moves them inside . " Says young Ivor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ games . Sometimes it seemed funny running in a race against an old man with white hair . But really he does n't seem old at all . He 's a beaut. " // At Portsea the brown-haired , impish Ivor enjoys an idyllic existence . Cerutty limits him to two hours a day of dune running and light weight lifting . The rest of the time Ivor goes fishing with Herb Elliott or just hangs around , listening . At night he sleeps in John Landy 's old bunk . Meals are typical Cerutty : raw oatmeal , dried fruit and walnuts for breakfast ; salads for lunch ; vegetable stew with a little meat and cooked barley or fish or chicken for dinner . // The elder Caudle , who once ran a 4:20 mile , is so taken with the Cerutty interest in Ivor that he has contemplated moving the family to Portsea from Adelaide . But Cerutty counseled against the move . " I told him to wait until the boy does something , " the coach said . So far the best " something " Ivor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a world record for 10-and-unders. // THE BRAVE BULL // There was a bullfight in Providence the other day . The combatants were a bull buffalo named Pal , who resides in an enclosure in a city park , and a fierce matador named Manuel ( Manolete ) Viera , who oversees the buffaloes in the park . // At 4 a.m . Pal got out of his cage , and Viera went after him . Aided by a troupe of peones , Viera got a rope on the bull , but el toro would not be held down by anything so fragile . At that point the true corrida began . Manolete decided to tire the bull with a series of passes . He began with a ver ? nica , followed with a couple of estatuarios and finished off with a pase de pecho . The bull gored him in the leg . // A substitute torero named Dr. Seymour Hoffman was brought in for la hora de la verdad . Declining to go in over the horns for the grand estocada , Dr. Hoffman approached the problem from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tranquilizer . Pal climbed happily into a cattle truck , his tail and both ears intact . Ol ? ! // MUSICAL HOUSES Seasonal housing is a problem with professional athletes . They may live in Schenectady and play for Fort Worth . The same is true of coaches . Three pro basketball coaches have handled it this way . Paul Seymour , who lives in Syracuse and coaches in St. Louis , has rented a house occupied during the baseball season by Cardinal Pitcher Larry Jackson . He has rented his Syracuse home to Syracuse Basketball Coach Alex Hannum . Hannum , who lives in Los Angeles in the off season , has rented his home to Fred Schaus , new coach of the Los Angeles Lakers , who moved from Morgantown , West Virginia . Now if Jackson could be persuaded to move to Morgantown .... // THE SAGA OF SOCKEYE SAM The single-mindedness of some of nature 's creatures has always amazed man  --  the lemmings and their suicidal drive to the sea , the eels ' annual return to the Sargasso , the swallows ' comeback @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Denver recently , naturalists heard another such saga . Scientists at the Bonneville Dam fisheries laboratory on the Columbia River had decided to find out how seriously the salmon takes his yearly task of swimming upstream to spawn . A system of connected pools , each a foot higher than the other , was set up , and a salmon was introduced . Affectionately known as Sam , the sockeye kept climbing to the top of the system , only to be sloshed down to the bottom by the ichthyologists . At the rate of 50 jumps an hour , Sam went through 6,648 pools , gained a total elevation of a mile and a quarter . By this time , Sam had n't even worked up a salmon 's version of a sweat , but the naturalists had . They opened the last gate and let Sam swim upstream .
