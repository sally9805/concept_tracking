WINNIE ILLE Pu ( 121 pp. ) -A Latin Rendition of Winnie-the-Pooh-A . A. Milne , translated by Alexander Lenard - Dutton ( $3 ) . <P> <P> Latin scholars , whenever they peek out from behind their soup-stained neckties and that untidy mess of irregular verbs , seem to be nice old dears . Take Alexander Lenard , M.D. , a 50-year-old Hungarian linguist who for the last eight years has been teaching and farming in a small town near Sao Paulo , Brazil . When he first read A. A. Milne 's Winnie-the-Pooh , he apparently thought of all those poor little children in ancient Rome who would never be able to read it , and he felt just awful . There was only one thing to do : translate it for them . So he did . Unfortunately , publication in ancient Rome turned out to be impractical , so Dr. Lenard paid for his book 's first edition himself . Surprisingly , there was a lot of interest in the modern world , and finally , the translator turned to the U.S. He had obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crib in every nursery . <P> Published this week , Winnie Ille Pu proves to be a Latinist 's delight , the very book that dozens of Americans , possibly even 50 , have been waiting for . For the weary pedagogue , home from The Gallic War , it provides surcease of solecism and a welcome chuckle . It might even make a suitable Latin text in a progressive school . <P> Classic , Medieval . On the whole , the translation is excellent ( see box ) . In fact , it is superior to the English original in at least one respect : Milne 's occasionally cloying cuteness can not be rendered in the sober Latin tongue . The tone of the translation is innocently serious , childlike rather than childish , and its style is graceful and frequently inspired . Milne 's names and phrases take on a rich new intonation in Lenard 's Latin . Heffalumpum ( for Heffalump ) sounds like the name of a dirty German town transliterated by Tacitus , lor ( for Eeyore ) might be a monster out of a Persian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Tiberian vintage , seldom earlier than Augustus , seldom later than Pliny , but the verse forms he employs are those of medieval doggerel , which he writes with distinction . <P> No Toast , No Butter . Now and then , of course . Dr. Lenard suffers a slip of the stylus . Forgivably enough , he fumbles a number of Milne 's choicer puns ( " ambush " as a bush , " issue " as a sneeze ) , and the great gag about Piglet 's grandfather . Trespassers W. somehow just lies there in Latin . Furthermore , panistostatus cum butyro , though verbally correct , makes no sense at all in the Roman context as a translation of " buttered toast . " According to Dr. Frederick L. Santee , a leading U.S. Latinist , the Romans had no toast and no word for it , and though they had a word for butter ( borrowed from the Greek ) , they never used the stuff . Why not just panis cum olio ?            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
