In the ancient city of Fez last week narrow alleys blazed with Morocco 's red and green colors and the air was heavy with incense and the odor of kif ( marijuana ) . From jampacked rooftops thousands of spectators roared " Marhaba ! " ( welcome ) . Amid the cheers , Morocco 's King Mohammed V , followed by scholars from 39 nations , walked a cobblestoned mile to the huge Karaouine mosque to celebrate a momentous occasion : the 1,100th anniversary of Fez 's Karaouine University . This Moslem school is older than any university in Europe . <P> Golden Days . Early in the 9th century , when Fez was still a young hamlet , its ruler cried : " O God , make this city a center of law and science where your book the Koran will be studied . " To fulfill this dream , a wealthy widow of Fez commissioned Karaouine mosque , which took 278 years to complete . The mosque was already famed as a university when the first European university was established in Bologna about noo . Begun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything from medicine to geography . <P> In these golden days of Arab power , Moslems were the world 's intellectual elite-the perfectors of algebra ( from the Arabic al-jabr : binding together ) , the founders of analytical geometry and of plane and spherical trigonometry , pioneers in astronomy ( through their need to locate Mecca precisely ) . As scholars flocked in from all over the world-among them a young Frenchman who later became Pope Sylvester II ( 999-1003 ) - Fez flourished as the " Baghdad of the West . " <P> Big Sleep . But with Europe 's resurgence , the Moslem world sank into a long intellectual sleep . By the mid-18th century , Karaouine 's able scientists had departed , leaving behind an obsolete religious curriculum taught by ulemas ( wise men ) , whose main claim to tenure was their power to vote on succession to the Moroccan throne . <P> <P> Under the French protectorate ( 1912-56 ) , the once proud university sank even lower as a kind of Moslem Kaffeeklatsch , without exams or degrees , a place of courtyard classrooms where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived in airless cubicles , three to one windowless room , sleeping on the floor and cooking on charcoal burners . <P> New Mecca . In 1956 came Morocco 's independence . Determined to propel his nation into the 20th century , King Mohammed slashed Karaouine 's religious studies , introduced math , physics , chemistry and foreign languages . In 1957 he jolted traditionalists by setting up a female branch at Karaouine , where the enrollment ( 6,325 ) now includes 1,197 women . Soon will come another big revolution : 3,000 cramped boarders will move to airy dormitories on the new campus outside Fez , which will boast 70 modern classrooms and laboratories and such un heard of niceties as a laundry , athletic field , infirmary and dining halls .
