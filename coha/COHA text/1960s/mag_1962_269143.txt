Alabamans last week picked for their next Governor a man whose segregationist ideas would make Orval Faubus seem like an admirer of the N.A.A.C.P. Winner of a Democratic primary runoff : former Circuit Judge George C. Wallace , 42 , of Barbour County . <P> Wallace , a onetime state Golden Gloves featherweight champion ( " The Barbour Bantam " ) , campaigned on a segregationist platform that seemed extreme even by Alabama standards . The federal judiciary , he claimed , is " lousy and irresponsible . " U.S. District Judge Frank M. Johnson Jr. , who once ordered voting records turned over to the U.S. Civil Rights Commission , was an " integrating , scalawagging , carpetbagging liar . " Promising that he would refuse to obey " any order to mix races in our schools , " Wallace offered to " stand in the schoolhouse door , " and , if need be , go to jail before permitting integration . To suggestions that his position might be too strong for the voters to stomach , Wallace retorted : " How can you be too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any middle of the road . You 're either for it or against it . " <P> Wallace 's opponent , State Senator Ryan deGraffenried , 37 , assured the electorate that he was as good a segregationist as the next man . But Wallace 's intemperance , he charged , would only stir up violence and chaos . Cried he : " It 's been the same pattern in every state where you have a loudmouth , rabble-rousing Governor . They have brought the walls of segregation tumbling down on their heads . " <P> Wallace won , 338,961 to 267,612.
