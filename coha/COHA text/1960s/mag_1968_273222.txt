For the third time since the start of the school year on Sept. 9 , most of New York City 's public schools were shut down-in large measure owing to the actions of one man . At the urging of its belligerent president , Albert Shanker , the United Federation of Teachers again walked out on strike ; more than 50,000 teachers abruptly abandoned their classrooms in the latest battle over the city 's ill-planned efforts at school decentralization . <P> Before the week ended , everyone was shouting angrily at everyone else . Those teachers who crossed the picket lines in an effort to keep some 400 of the city 's 900 schools limping along with skeleton staffs ran into a bitter barrage of invective . " Commies ! " " Fascists ! " " Nazi Lovers ! " " Nigger Lovers ! " shouted the highly confused strikers , many of them veterans of years of tortured teaching in the city 's ghetto schools . Mayor John Lindsay , wearing a yarmulke , was jeered and insulted in a Brooklyn synagogue by a teacher-dominated audience as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shanker himself was shouted off the stage at a Manhattan meeting by a highly vocal crowd of black parents , who called him a white racist . <P> Vomit from Hell . The issue reaches beyond New York . Washington , Philadelphia , Milwaukee and other large cities are also grappling with the problem of how to run a sprawling urban school system . Like New York , they are trying or considering experiments in decentralization , and some of the arguments for such experiments are persuasive . Citywide school boards tend to become remote and impersonal ; parents , particularly in ghetto areas , want more and more to have a say in choosing teachers for their children . Yet the problem of how to delegate powers to local boards without disrupting a whole system can be staggering . <P> New York 's trouble began after a neighborhood governing committee in the Ocean Hill-Brownsville section of Brooklyn summarily transferred teachers because they were supposedly trying to sabotage the experiment . The committee was never able to document its harsher charges , but it stubbornly refused to back down , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school board finally suspended the Ocean Hill committee and its administrator , Rhody McCoy , because it refused to return the unwanted teachers to their regular duties . The move seemed to ease the crisis . The teachers were grudgingly accepted in seven of Ocean Hill 's eight schools , and attendance throughout the citywide system returned almost to normal . <P> But in Ocean Hill 's heavily Negro and Puerto Rican Junior High School 271 , the controversial teachers were harassed by the nonunion staff . One acting principal , herself a Negro , claimed that she was confronted and threatened in her office by outside militants and later intimidated by Ocean Hill Committee Chairman the Rev. C. Herbert Oliver-a charge Oliver dismissed as " a vicious lie , vomited from the jaws of hell . "
