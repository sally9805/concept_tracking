At an interesting watershed for the much manipulated U.S. economy , two of the nation 's most prestigious economic voices last week prescribed the same course-for widely differing reasons . Gardner Ackley , chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers , and William McChesney Martin , chairman of the Federal Reserve Board , renewed the call for a tax increase to fend off inflation . <P> Ackley , testifying before the Congressional Joint Economic Committee , conceded that the economy in the first half of 1967 had performed " more sluggishly than we anticipated " and " is not advancing too rapidly today . " Still , he forecast a hot second half . Said he : " A strong revival of demand is on the way - one that will produce either unacceptable inflationary pressures or a return to tight money , or more probably both , by early next year at the latest . " Only a 1967 tax increase , by Ackley 's recipe , will forestall such a future . Yet he an- noyed the committee members by refusing to be pinned down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase . <P> Not so Bill Martin , a much less political and much more independent man than Ackley , but nevertheless an early supporter of President Johnson 's January request for a 6% surcharge on corporate and personal income taxes . Speaking to the Toledo Rotary Club , the FRB chairman bluntly urged higher taxes without delay . Moreover , he said he would back an increase even larger than 6% , " if warranted , " after Congress makes this year 's appropriations . Unlike Ackley , who based his argument on bullish expectations of a strongly rising market for durable goods , a burst of spending for factories , and an early end to the economic drag of falling business inventories , Martin accentuated the negative . <P> Martin 's argument was founded on anticipation of a huge and inflationary federal budget deficit . Having closed the 1967 fiscal year July 1 with a deficit of about $11 billion , second highest since World War II , the Administration now estimates that the next year 's will be $13.6 billion . Treasury Secretary Henry Fowler recently admitted that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of the Viet Nam war . Warned Martin in Toledo : " We must have adequate , effective-and above all - prompt tax action that would whittle down the deficit to manageable proportions . Delay would permit inflationary forces to gain momentum . " <P> Dark Spots . Behind the words of both Ackley and Martin lay the fact that the U.S. economy is pulling out of the winter downturn which is being called , in current vogue , the " mini-recession . " Though the economy , as Martin noted , " is beginning to show signs of moving ahead again , " many dark spots remain . Despite massive stimulation to business through an easing of credit and a sharp rise in federal spending , industrial production has slipped four months out of the past five on the Federal Reserve Board index ; in May , it fell 2% below its December peak . The nation 's real output of goods and services , in the first three months of this year , missed its clockwork quarterly advance for the first time since 1961 . <P>    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
