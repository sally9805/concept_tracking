There is nothing quite so Arabian in Lawrence of Arabia as an actor named Omar Sharif , a flashing dark fellow with the white Formica smile of a desert chieftain , the scowling fury of a sandstorm , and the overall dash of half a dozen swordsmen trained by Abdul Abulbul Amir . Actors like that usually come from Pasadena , or some similar place , but this one is an exception . He is a citizen of the United Arab Republic , born in Alexandria , raised in Cairo . <P> At the outset of the vast trackless movie , when T. E. Lawrence ( Peter O'Toole ) and a guide drink at an oasis , a rifle shot cuts down the guide . It is Sharif who has thus spoken ; the oasis is his . Lawrence adroitly talks his way past this crisis and proceeds with Sharif as his new guide and eventual friend . For the remainder of four hours-through thick , thin and thaumaturgy-Sharif stays close to the side of the English Enigma . Women who have seen the picture say that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alec Guinness , Anthony Quinn , Jack Hawkins and so on , but at night they dream about Omar Sharif . <P> General Sheriff . Since Omar would n't really qualify as an actor unless there were something a little bit fake about him , there are a few small redeeming flaws in his essential oneness with the desert . His Arabic is , well , shocking , and he is studying to improve it . He is the son of a rich lumber dealer , who sent him to Cairo 's Victoria College , a properly English Eton on the Nile , where he captained the association football club . French was spoken at home . <P> Omar 's dazzling teeth are his own , but his name is not . He is actually Maechel Shalhoub . Years ago , planning ahead toward international fame , he guessed correctly that to Western ears there was no chic-of-Araby in the sound of Shalhoub . He thought , he says , of Omar Khayyam and Omar Bradley , both familiar names several thousand miles west . He may also have thought of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he entered his profession as Omar Sharif . <P> Gently forced into his father 's business after school days , Omar hated the lumber game , and he cost the firm thousands of pounds by extending credit only to dealers who needed it most . He became a Cairo playboy , good at billiards , unfaithful to his sports cars and always buying new ones . He played , too , with the theater , acting a little . Then one day he got a chance to audition for a leading role opposite Fatten Hamama . <P> Every syllable of her precious name-fat ten ha ma ma-was a treasure on the tongues of the moviegoers of Egypt . She was , by Egyptian description , " the Shirley Temple of Arabian movies " -a star since the age of seven and a radiant symbol of sweet , untouched Islamic puritanism . She was 20 and spoke no English . When she auditioned Omar in her east-side apartment high over the Nile , she said to him : " Do something . " <P> " What ? " <P> " Act , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nunnery , " bellowed Omar , pointing a long finger at her and pouring Prince Hamlet 's cruel speech into her uncomprehending ears .
