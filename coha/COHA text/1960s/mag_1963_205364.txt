The Strait of Messina , a turbulent , six-mile-wide ribbon of water that separates Sicily from the toe of Italy , has never been a popular place for water sports . It was the home of Scylla and Charybdis , the mythological monsters that wrecked ships and snatched unsuspecting seamen from their decks . And if sailors beware , swimmers positively shun the place . Only the very rash-or the very bold-venture into its treacherous currents . <P> <P> The water temperature was a frigid 54 one day recently when Mary Margaret Revell , a pretty blonde of 25 , stepped into the surf at Sicily 's Lido di Mortelle , pulled a pair of goggles over her eyes , and set out for the distant Italian coast . Two and a half hours later , she waded ashore , paused just long enough to gulp down honey , glucose tablets and tea , then started back toward Sicily . The going was tougher now ; her right arm developed a cramp ; she swallowed sea water and vomited . Only her legs kept her going . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water , Mary Revell staggered ashore at Grotta , Sicily-the first person ever to swim the Messina Strait both ways . She blew a kiss to the cheering crowd on the beach , then collapsed . <P> Against the Shark . Queen of the world 's marathon swimmers , Mary is the daughter of a Shafter , Calif. , dentist who would have preferred a Portia to a naiad . But law was for landlubbers , and in 1958 she swam from Malibu to Santa Monica , a distance of 18 miles , in 8 hrs. 19 min . Next came California 's 25-mile Catalina <P> Channel . Mary made it , but not before she had collided with a shark-which fled . <P> In 1961 , she splashed 7 miles across Michigan 's Straits of Mackinac , and 18 miles down the Detroit River . <P> Marathon swimming is an expensive hobby-boats must be hired , support crews trained-and Mary needed someone to bankroll her adventures . Daddy did not offer , and Mary did not ask . To her rescue came the National Tea Council ( she drinks tea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Society of Non-Smokers ( she does not smoke ) and the National Swimming Pool Institute . When Mary swam the Strait of Gibraltar last June , solicitous Spanish smugglers provided boats and guides . In July , a Turkish newspaper persuaded her to visit Turkey . She shocked the staid Turks by wandering around in Bermuda shorts , but within a month she made herself a national heroine by swimming the Bosporus ( both crosswise and lengthwise ) and the Dardanelles , then chugging 20 miles across the Sea of Marmara in 8 hrs. 13 min . <P> Against the Grease . Mary already has more records than any other lady marathoner , and now she has set her heart on the Sea of Galilee , Lake Geneva , Loch Ness , New Zealand 's Cook Strait and , of course , the English Channel . Tall ( 5 ft. 91 in. ) and lissome ( 137 Ibs . ) , Mary is a featherweight compared with most Channel swimmers , who pile on fat as protection against the chilly water . She spurns the traditional coating of axle grease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more water-repellent . And when she is in the water , her thoughts are miles away . " I concentrate on my family and other people who are fond of me , " she says . " The worst thing you can do is worry about whether you 'll make it . "
