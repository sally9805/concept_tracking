txt Senator Barry Goldwater said today that he had long believed " taw with Red China might be profitable " to end the war in South Vietnam . If he were elected President , he indicated , he would be willing to permit negotiations with Peking . He also expressed a qualified belief that the Johnson Administration was working for a negotiated settlement of the war in South Vietnam . A little later , however , Mr. Goldwater appeared to modify his remarks to indicate that he had in mind some form of ultimatum rather than negotiations in the usual sense . Mr. Goldwater interrupted a five-day Pacific cruise to hold a news conference aboard the yacht Sundance in this harbor on Santa Catalina Island . lie ' wore bright red trousers , a white terrycloth shirt and blue sneakers without socks . His face was tanned beneath a day 's growth of beard . Asked if he meant he would be willing to negotiate with Peking for a settlement of the war in South Vietnam , Mr. Goldwater said , " I think that is where you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would be willing " to see such talks , he would not personally negotiate with Chinese leaders . After reporters had left his yacht , Paul Wagner , a press aide to Mr. Goldwater , called him on a ship-to-shore telephone to say that some of them were uncertain of his meaning " about Red China . " Paraphrases Goldwater Mr. Wagner then gave the following explanation , which he said was a paraphrase of what Mr. Goldwater had told him from the yacht : It has been suggested by military men and some civilian ex-I perts that when the military situation in South Vietnam grows stronger , the American position in South Vietnam will make it possible to tell Communist China that unless it stops supplying the Vietcong insurgents , the United States will take some , specific action ? " blowing up a bridge , or something , " in Mr. Goldwater 's words . This was not a recommendation , but a " not impossible " idea , Mr. Wagner said . According to Mr. Wagner , Mr. Goldwater said that the United States could prevent ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this would be " a convincing way . " " He was talking about nego tiation in the sense that you tell them what you 're going to do if they do n't stop , " Mr. Wagner explained . This varied from the impression some of the reporters received in the news conference . On the yacht . Mr. Goldwater had also expressed a qualified belief that the Johnson Administration was already working toward a negotiated settlement of the war in Vietnam . " My political clones tell me , " he said , that the Administration will act to negotiate a peace before Election Day . In other remarks , he said that Southerners should not be excluded front consideration for seats on the Supreme Court because smile might make " fine members . " The Republican Presidential nominee also reported that his private polls were " pretty much the same " as the public polls showing him far behind President Johnson , but that there were " good signs of improvement .

Mr. Whiteman is a Beverly Hills real-estate man . Fears a Giveaway Clearly the Goldwaters were enjoying the cruise . Boatloads of people sailed by , and Mr. Goldwater often interrupted his news conference to shout , " Hi , folks . " He remarked wistfully , " If I could just campaign out here . " He appeared to show sympathy to the idea of a properly safeguarded settlement in Vietnam , but then indicated serious doubts about its wisdom . He said he felt sure the Johnson Administration was taking steps toward negotiations to end the Vietnamese war . But he also said he was only " guessing " on ' this point . . After saying he expected a negotiated peace almost- any day , he added : " I hope it will be an honest one , and not one that will give the country to the Communists . I 'm afraid that 's what- we will have if we have one . " He said he " could approve of some kinds " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that set up a troika type government like Laos , which loses the country . " In Laos , the establishment of a **27;732;TOOLONG coalition government failed to halt military thrusts by the proCommunist Pathet Lao . The current military situation in South Vietnam , he said , " gives the United States little bargaining power . " The Senator added that " if we had kept up our attacks " on North Vietnam and had " in-I terdicted supply lines to the Vietcone , guerrillas , North Vietnam and China would " recognize there is no future in a long , futile war . " Wary of Geneva Talks . To obtain an honorable peace , he went on , " you have to make the military situation more favorable , " and this can not be done inside South Vietnam itself . He seemed to suggest that negotiations might be initiated through the United Nations . Asked what he thought of reconvening the 1954 Geneva conference that partitioned Vietnam , set up a neutral Laos and ended French colonial rule in Indochina , Mr. Goldwater said , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come out with . " Washington has opposed calls by France and the Coral/midst bloc for new Geneva talks . At one point , predicting a negotiated settlement , Mr. Goldwater said , " The white papers are out , and the runners ' are up . " This appeared to allude to a proposal by Willard Matthias , a member of the Central Intelligence Agency 's Board of National Estimates . He was  --  the author of a 50-page working paper , dated June 8 and published last week , suggesting the possibility of " some kind of negotiated settlement . " While publishing the paper , the Administration insisted that it did not represent American policy . Mr. Goldwater stressed his be lief that a proper settlement of the war in South Vietnam would have to preserve the sovereignty of . the South Vietnamese Government . He said he opposed any inclusion of the National Liberation Front , parent movement of the Vietcong , in a coalition government . But he said at another point , that a satisfactory agreement would be one with " as little Communist participation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no quick answer " to the war in Vietnam . He said that he had " nothing to offer " in the way of i solutions , and that " I know that ' the solution is not . military the long run . " Good Lawyers ' in South Mr. Goldwater was ask about reports that some South- ; ern Republican leaders had been saying privately that if he was elected the South 's feelings on civil-rights issues would be considered in the appoint- , meat of an Attorney General ' and in other matters . A President , he said , must " take into consideration the whole country . " " Any President would 13e wrong to say that because the South is against civil rights , that they do n't have any good lawyers down there , " he added . He said some Southerners would make fine members of the Supreme Court . Mr. Goldwater added that if he were President he would take the question of appointments to the nation 's highest bench seriously and would not " want them biased one way or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news conference on the Sundance , Mr. Goldwater was also asked what he meant yesterday in a Cleveland speech when he spoke of " conventional nuclear weapons , " which he said should be furnished to the North Atlantic Treaty Organiaztion . " Any weapon carried by an infantryman or a team of infantrymen , " he said , " could and should be called a conventional nuclear weapon . " He said the United States was working to develop smaller tactical nuclear weapons and added that he could see the day when mortar-size and possibly rifle-size nuclear weapons could be developed . Such weapons , he added , could deliver " the same firepower on a battalion position " as present infantry weapons , " but ' with one weapon " rather than several . He said he had broached the matter because he hoped to inform the American people during the Presidential campaign that not all nuclear weapons were massive and that not all were designed az'city- , killers " or " blockbusters : " ,              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
