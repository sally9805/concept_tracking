No human being has yet ventured into the fearsome region beyond protection of the earth 's ( magnetism . Neither Gagarin , I Titov , Glenn nor Carpenter penetrated so far . How will the moon men survive ? How will they react , live , and work ? Today , in the great laboratories and test chambers of Project Apollo , answers to these questions are being worked out . Since life evolved on earth , two great shields have stood between that life and the radiation , meteors and other perils of space .

Because the first astronauts will land on the moon during the two-week lunar day , the temperature of the surface onto which they step will probably be close to 240 degrees Fahrenheit . However , the environment will differ from that on a city , street " hot enough to fry ? an egg . " We feel the heat of the pavement in two ways : by conduction and by radiation . Heat speeds up the motions of atoms and molecules . This agitation spreads through a gas , liquid or solid because of increased molecular collisions . This is known as conduction . On the moon there is no air and hence there should be virtually no conduction , except through an astronaut 's feet . However , the radiated heat im. ; pinging on his space suit , both from the naked sun above and from the torrid surface below , will be searing . Hence , the lunar astronaut will probably carry a. back-pack cooling system .

Several of great intensity have been observed since - then . Follows Cycle The frequency of solar flares follows the eleven-year sunspot cycle . But it is not yet certain that ' this is true of the hazardGUS type . Hence it is not possible to predict the chances of such a flare with much accuracy . . This prediction capability may be improved by the time of the first manned flight to the moon . Meanwhile , , it may be possible to give a few minutes ' warning . The dangerous flare emits a peculiar radio noise that reaches the earth Shortly before ' the lethal particles do . The last sunspot maximum occurred in 1958-59 and the next minimum is expected in 1964-65 .

The United States is expected to make its first attempt to land men on the moon between 1967 and 1970 . By the latter date the sun probably will be highly active . Even then , however , the chances of a lethal flare 's occurring during a weeklong round trip to the moon , more than 200,000 miles from earth , seem slim . There are many other forms ' of radiation in space , including ) those that span the entire electromagnetic spectrum from radio waves through infrared , vis-1 ible and ultraviolet light , Xrays and gamma rays . Cosmic rays are not rays of light . They are high-energy particles , a small percentage of which have sufficient energy to pierce the earths magnetism and atmosphere . About 10,000 of them hit every square yard of New York every second . This is part of the natural radiation of our environment . At very high altitudes cosmic rays have caused graying of hair in experimental animals . At least one balloonist was similarly affected . It seems so far that cosmic rays do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that planned for the Apollo flight .. The Apollo vehicle will , it is hoped , provide adequate shielding against most flares . Construction material , skin thickness , arrangement of equipment in the vehicle  --  all will be designed for maximum protection . On the way to the moon , sunseeking equipment will keep the axis of the vehicle pointed towards the sun . This should provide some protection . The particles ejected by a flare probably follow a curved path . It is not possible at present to predict to what extent they would strike the vehicle from the side , or even from behind . If the men work outside the spacecraft , they will retreat to it when warned from the earth that a flare has occurred . Titov 's Illness The problem of weightlessness became of increased concern after it was announced by the Russians that Maj. Gherman S. Titov , in his seventeen-orbit flight last August , felt ill after the first few orbits . His is the only flight that has lasted a full day . Weightlessness occurs when the force of gravity is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A vehicle and its passengers , cancel each other out . This is true of any object in free flight , whether it be falling to earth , flying to the moon or in orbit . The phenomenon is experienced , to some extent , by the passengers in an elevator that descends suddenly . It can be achieved , for ' up to one minute , by zooming high-speed aircraft into upward arcs . According to Dr. Stanley C. White of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration , Major Titov apparently became ill on his sixth orbit . Apollo medical men are particularly interested in observing American astronauts who make six or more orbits . Dr. White is chief of the Life Systems Division of the Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston , Tex . Perhaps the sickness that the Soviet astronaut felt was a selflimiting condition . Major Titov was apparently able to perform his tasks . He went to sleep after the sixth orbit . This raises the possibility that fatigue might have been a factor in his illness and that his - inactivity while sleeping might have cured him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only thing that can be done now is to see whether American astronauts do develop a sickness related to prolonged weightlessness . It might be a mild illness that could be remedied by pills or rests . But , - at worst , it may prove necessary to provide artificial gravity in the spacecraft by rotating it . If artificial gravity is needed  --  and gravity like that at the surface of the earth could be achieved by rotating a space vehicle of fifteen-foot radius every 4.5 seconds  --  then the question arises how much gravity is essential . Should 6 desicrners try to duplicate the gravitational field of the earth , or should they select the gravitational field of the moon , which is one-sixth that of the earth ? Human Relations Problem To date , the problem of human relations has not arisen in space travel . The orbits flown by American and Soviet astronauts have all been solo flights .

Two of the three men might form an alliance b excludin. - the third . Some experience with twoman crews has been attained in the two-man space cabin simulator of the Air Force School , of Aerospace Medicine at Brooks Air Force Base , San Antonio , Tex . The purpose of the ' experiments , as described by Dr.I Hans G. Clamann , is to study reactions in space cabin atmospheres in preparation for Projects Gemini and Apollo . In Project Gemini , two-man teams of astronauts will orbit the earth for up to two weeks at a time , practicing skills necessary for Project Apollo . Dr. Clamann said it was expected that the Gemini cabin would contain 100 per cent oxygen at a cabin pressure of five pounds a square inch . The Apollo cabin , he said , will probably have an atmosphere half oxy- , gen and half nitrogen at a Ares-1 sure of 7.35 pounds a square inch , about half the atmospheric pressure of the earth at sea level . It has long been known that man can not breathe 100 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reactions . However , if the pressure is reduced , oxygen breathing becomes more acceptable . In the Gemini and Apollo spacecraft , lowered pressure would simplify design . In the experiments at Brooks , volunteers lived inside space cabin simulators with artificial atmospheres . They followed a daily pattern ' of work and sleep and had contact with the outside world through dials and Wires . One test lasted thirty days with crew members breathing 40 per cent oxygen and 60 per cent nitrogen at a pressure equivalent to that at 18,000 feet altitude . Other tests lasted for sixteen days with the two-man erc breathing a 100 per cent oxyg.et atmosphere at a simulated 1-titude of 33.500 feet .
