The Birds . With a shrieking din , the lettering of the titles and credits comes on , only to be pecked from the screen by a squadron of crazed starlings . Having hinted at the ornithophobic horror to come , Director Alfred Hitchcock goes nattering on with an hour of some silly plot-boiling about a flirtatious society girl ( Tippi Hedren ) , a lovelorn schoolmarm ( Suzanne Pleshette ) , an Oedipus wreck ( Rod Taylor ) and a pair of lovebirds . Hitchcock addicts will just be getting jittery for their first fix of gore when it suddenly becomes clear that the birds is coming : man 's feathered friends set themselves to wipe out an entire village on the California coast . <P> <P> Finches and crows stage nasty attacks , but seagulls turn out to be deadliest . At the climax , Rod Taylor has barricaded his house , nailed planks over the windows , locked the doors , lighted a fire against invasion down the chimney . Suddenly , out of the stillness , comes the thud of heavy bird bodies hurling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smash windowpanes , the splintering of wood as beaks peck through the door . One gull manages to wriggle inside a window barricade ; before Taylor can strangle it , his arm and hand have been bloodied . The sound track - there is not a note of music throughout the picture-reaches a deafening crescendo of screeching , whistling , chattering , flapping cacophony . <P> Now . Why did the birds go to war ? Fans hooked on Hitchcock may be dismayed to discover that , after 38 years and more than 40 films dealing mainly in straightforward shockery , the Master has traded in his uncomplicated tenets of terror for a new outlook that is vaguely nouvelle vague . The lovebirds , ostensibly family pets , perching smugly in their cage throughout the attack , seem to Know Something . Are they spies for the gulls ? Do they somehow madden other species ? Or are they just a comment , a wry admonition that men should " love birds " ? Hitchcock does not tell , and the movie flaps to a plotless end . <P> Newcomer Hedren bids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hitchcock Ice Princesses ( bland , blonde predecessors : Eva Marie Saint , Grace Kelly , Kim Novak , Madeleine Carroll ) if she can learn to register horror more convincingly before the cameras roll again . Veteran Ethel Grififies , as a sensible-shoed bird lover , provides a deft and daft counterpoint to the bird-damning villagers . But the most unforgettable performers in The Birds are the birds . They are utterly , terrifyingly believable as they go about their bloody business of murdering humanity . Pigeons loitering around the exits of theaters where this movie is shown would be wise to lie low until the next change of feature .
