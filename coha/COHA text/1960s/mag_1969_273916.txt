In 1968 , the company earned about $60,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a considerable feat for an African enterprise . Nzeru has just introduced a portable model that , together with a new radio-phonograph , promises to increase sales . <P> Kroeker has also produced a phonograph record called Ufa Wa Mtedza ( Peanut Flour ) ; its rock songs were composed and sung by Peace Corpsman Jack Allison , who dispenses health hints musically .
