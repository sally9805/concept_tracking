As the nation grows , so grows the Capitol building . But for every hand raised to make it truly workable , a thousand protests rise from preservationists who feel that the monument should be as immutable and functionless as the Statue of Liberty . <P> Approval of plans to extend the west front of the Capitol was greeted predictably last week . Senator Joseph Clark of Pennsylvania threatened a bill making it a crime to deface the Capitol . Representative Sam Stratton of New York promised to organize a committee of 1,000,000 . Senator Mike Monroney of Oklahoma called the plans " inconceivable . " William Walton , chairman of Washington 's Fine Arts Commission , said : " We have come to the conclusion that to erase this great historic facade would be a national tragedy . " <P> Problem is , the ancient sandstone walls have crumbled like cake , and the limited space inside is pinching tightly . The $34 million reconstruction will move parts of the main facade as much as 88 ft. westward , adding 41 acres of badly needed floor space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new area will fit conference and committee rooms , 109 offices for Congressmen , a pair of auditoriums seating 400 each , cafeterias and dining rooms seating 1,600 people . Many of the new facilities , including those for eating , are designed to handle tourists who now visit the Capitol at a rate of 30,000 a day . Every detail of the present painted sandstone exterior will be copied as exactly as possible in durable white marble . However , an added triangular pediment , similar to the one already in place over the east front , and several columns worth of widening are proposed . <P> What spurs on preservationists is that the project is controlled by an Architect of the Capitol who is not an architect . They recall that J. George Stewart , 76 , an engineer and onetime Congressman , was responsible for the multimillion-dollar fiasco of the Rayburn House Office Building across the street south of the Capitol . Stewart 's critics were also furious when he used marble in the east front extension . <P> Oddly enough , Stewart 's earliest predecessor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When he designed the original Capitol in 1792 , he begged President Washington to use marble . Washington vetoed his request as too expensive and supplied sandstone from his own quarry .
