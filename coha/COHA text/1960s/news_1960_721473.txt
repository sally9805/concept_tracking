txt Jimmy Hoffa promised to whip up a politic:1J hurricane this year But . for all his huffing and puffing most of his foes who weir ? ? ? upposeci to be %%haled zia%ay are relaxing in what is more like a pleasant In eeze As pi esident of the Teamsters , the nation 's biggest union Jimmy seemed not only cocky but convincing last October when he plunged his organization into national politics . Today , out of 56 legislators he marked for extinction , a very few , in seats already shaky , are rated in danger of defeat For at least as many , the Hoffa campaign has boomeranged ; it 's helping them . But for most it is just nothing at all . Fighting failure , the Teamster chief scurries about the country exhorting his followers to " get into politics with both feet . " He sounds two battle cries ' Beat Jack Kennedy , who is accused o ' trying to crucify the Teamsters : and elect " friendly " Congressmen of either party . To pump political fervor into local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along with thousands of black-andgold key chains to be awarded to cash contributors Poor Results Yet by the testimony of politicians and Teamsters themselves , these ate the results to date The anti-Kennedy crusade has not caught fire Many Teamsters. union officials privately confess , have proved skeptical about opposing the Democratic Presidential nominee , no matter what Mr Hoffa says . Most of Mr Hoffa 's Congressional targets are scarcely being molested , either openly or furtively In no more than a dozen of these districts , reckons one union official , is there any serious Teamster effort to oust the incumbents The union 's biggest drives are directed against Republican Congressmen In New York City , Chicago and Akron . Lawmakers bearing the Teamster stamp of approval , even those who say they 'd welcome open support from the union , have received scant electioneering help " We ca n't drop Teamster work to go out and do that , " insists a local union official in Wheeling , W.Va , where Teamsters theoretically are backing the re-election of G 0 P Rep. Arch Moore The union is hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , except to say kind words or harsh ones about certain candidates . When the Teamsters did endorse one Democratic Senate hopeful , South Dakota 's George MrGovein , he promptly repudiated Mei ! support Cash Contributors As a potential 3 million-plus voters among Teamster members and their families , less than 10G , about 250,009 , have so far come across with the cash contributions entitling them to the gift of a key chain It 's true Teamster money has been ladled out to favored candidates and more will follow , possibly as much as $1 million will be available But as Mr. Hotta himself notes ? " Political success will not come through the handing out of dollars to politicians " It will come , he says , through door-to-door precinct work to register Teamsters and get them to the polls By that yardstick ? Mr Hoffa apparently is ( loomed to disappointment His union spreads into 27S Congressional ( listings in all 50 states Mote than half its 17 million members are r one entrated In six key states - New York .

Teamster election ambitions are further handicapped by the fact that Mr. Hoffa 's two top political strategists are out of action at this crucial time . Harold Gibbons . Teamster vice president . and Sidney Zagri. the union 's political director , went on trial in St. Louis last week , charged by the Federal Government with unlav , ful use of dues money for political purposes in past campaigns But do n't count Mr Hoffa out forever " This is really just a dry run . " contends a Teamster executive privately . " We 're aiming for 1962 and 1964 " And Mr. Hoffa has at least picked a cadre to build around in future years . Although the Hoffa drive is falling far short of its goals , it is making progress in some areas . In New York City , with the greatest concentration of Teamster members in the nation , a model registration drive ( estimated cost : $75,000 ) is aiming to ' double the roster of union members registered to vote ; the ell. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This campaign could spell trouble for two Republican Congressmen in the New York metropolitan area , Francis Dorn of Brooklyn and John Ray of Staten Island . Both are priority Teamster targets Both had skimp victory margins in 1958 Additional thousands of Teamster votes in their districts could turn them out . Chicago Campaign In Chicago . another Teamster power center , a similar block-by-block registration drive is well advanced under a full-time Teamster political director , Joe Bernstein Rep. Edward Derwinski , a Republican , is the chief Teamster foe there , and his district also is marginal . But the feverish activity in New York and Chicago is by no means typical . Consider , for example , the first Congressional District of West Virginia , that finger of the Mountain State that sticks up between Ohio and Pennsylvania . Coming from this district loaded with union members , Republican Rep. Moore broke ranks with his party colleagues last year and voted against the Landrum-Griffin labor reform bill . So grateful Teamsters in Washington decided to support him , regardless , of party . When local Teamsters were skeptical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rushed the word to West Virginia to back Mr. Moore . The Teamster Washington office dispatched to West Virginia a kit of pamphlets instruct:g local leaders how to make card ' files listing names of Teamsters and their wives ; how to conduct a street-by-street canvass ; how to recruit " neighborhood stewards , " one for every 15 Teamster families ; how to pinpoint unregistered voters and persuade them to sign I up . In Rep. Moore 's district , this plan , if it 's followed and proves successful , would produce about 6,000 Teamster votes , counting members ' families . What Is the district 's Teamster leadership doing to marshal this . force behind Mr. Moore ? " W6 have n't dug into that part of it , " replies H. Cletis Tuttle , broad-shouldered secre- tary-treasurer of Teamster Local 897 in Wheeling . " We have n't taken too much active participation " Studying the Kit Has he studied the kit of instructions sent out by Teamster headquarters ? Mr Tuttle ? - efleets a bit ? ' It seems to me we did get one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here but I have n't studied it . " Is Mr. Tuttle just being discreet ' Rep Moore does n't think so , and neither does his Dernoci atm opponent , 41-year-old Steven D Natick . Both vouch for the union 's local reputation , neither would repudiate a Teamster endorsement But neither has detected the slightest sign of Teamster political activity . Mr. Moore says he 's never been informed he was to get Teamster support . In some areas , Teamsters are working in cooperation with the A F.L - C.I 0 . Committee on Political Education , so evaluating the effect of the Teamster work alone is difficult . Rep Bill Ayres of Ohio , for example , is under combined assault from Teamsters and other unions Mr. Ayres represents a district packed with unionized rubber industry workers , yet has eked out a victory five straight times despite his Republican label . This year , labor " put on the greatest drive ever to get voters registered in the Democratic precincts of Akron , " Mr. Ayers says . He estimates the vote in these precincts will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Teamsters , with a full-time political director working out of Cleveland , have had a big hand in the Ayres fight But more typical are the experiences of such avowed Hoffa targets as Rep Bruce Alger of Texas , Rep William Avery of Kansas and Rep Thomas F. Johnson of Maryland . Supporters of these Congressmen say they have yet to detect any signs of activity by the Teamsters . An aide of Rep. Johnson , one of two Democrats on Mr. Hoffa 's list , puts it this way : " Hoffa 's blowing off that he 's going to do so much ? I do n't think he 's doing much of anything . "
