As FOR me , to go to Poland is to step through the Looking Glass . The people are superb , but there 's also the Red Queen , dressed up as the State now , and I have simple Alice reactions to the State Queen : barking mad and beastly , is what I say to myself . The Polish people are used to the Red Queen , and besides are indestructible . They stay sane and make jokes . On my second visit to Poland I thought I learned more , but in the end I was only sure of what I felt . This would be of supreme unimportance except . that I imagine that my emotions are standard , typical , those of anyone of low-average stamina brought up in the Western world and accustomed to such amenities as the lifelong habit of calling your soul your oWn . We sat in a charming candlelit cellar in the beautifully rebuilt old town of Warsaw , and it might have been a glamorous restaurant anywhere . The other tables were filled , although this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchange , let alone on the thieving official rate . I marveled at the girls ? fragile pretty creatures , soft-voiced , fair , wearing the new beehive hairdos , modern products of modern hardship who retain a gentleness and grace seldom seen amongst us . The young men looked chipper . The older couples were neat , dark-clad , middle-class bourgeoisie , you would think , dining out on the cook 's night off . My companions might have been a tweedy English professor and his delicate wife . My professorial friend has been in prison sometime or other , for one of the new reasons : these have to do with economics and are pure **30;1359;TOOLONG . I listened to a trial in Krakow where eight men were being judged , under the criminal code , for incompetence in their State-owned cooperative . They could easily have been stupid or inexperienced , but that sort of common-sense interpretation of life is not the way the law works . Whether you lose money or make money , you can always go to jail , if the State wishes . Listening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jail , to have been in jail , is about on a par with our reaction to a bad case of influenza . Nasty , rotten luck , can happen to anyone , nothing to shout about , something to avoid if possible , and obviously no stigma attaches to it . Self-pity seems unknown among Poles , and this lack imparts a fine astringent tone to their thinking and conversation . They talk about themselves and the life of their country as if they stood several miles away . I was therefore not surprised to hear my friend point out , with detachment , some valuable accomplishments of the State . He said , " This regime gets no credit , even for the good things it does ; the people are so against it because it was imposed from the outside . " At the end of this journey I tried , within my limited knowledge , to draw up a balance sheet in the only terms I understand ? which have to do with happiness , decency , dignity ? on the good and the bad in Polish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They know what I do not : they know what existence is like in the other satellite countries and in Russia . Compared with what others have got , the Poles think they have something resembling real life . THE State giveth and the State taketh away , and the State gives an amazing amount of what it calls culture . True , the tone of this culture has been so brilliant only since 1956 , when the Poles made their national revolution against Stalinism . And true , the State is clamping down again on the rationed freedom and range of the arts . A wise journalist explained this gradually renewed but strongly resented death grip on expression : " I think there are three reasons . The first is economic . We are even poorer than we were a year and a half ago ; since there must be saving , some of it must be made on the arts . As to books , we now export more wood because coal did n't turn out well , so there is simply less paper . The second reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Polish films , Polish painting , Polish books have been too much praised in the West . East Germans and Czechs tattle to the Russians ; it is very embarrassing for our government , this unorthodox , un-Communist success . Finally , the regime believes that intellectuals of every kind always have to be kept in their place . " Throughout Poland , there is an enormous attentive audience for the best work that can be done in the theater , in films , in music , in painting , and in writing . Every little provincial town has its theater and orchestra ; companies go on tour regularly to the smaller villages ; editions of the classics and of good foreign and Polish writers are sold out in a matter of days ; picture galleries are jammed . I would be amazed to find that Alton , Illinois , had a permanent stock company , with a range from Shakespeare to Arthur Miller ( and no bilge in between ) , and played all week , every week , to a crowded theater . But the theater in Katowice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was putting on Arthur Miller 's A View from the Bridge while I was there , and on a sunny Thursdayafternoon you could not get a seat in the hushed house . " Why do they like it , Julek ? " I asked . " The public adores it , " he said . " They adore such complicated fantastical problems . It is a nice rest . I think Miller talks too much . Very heavy . The provinces love him . " And is there any town in America of half a million people , the size of Krakow , which has ten legitimate theaters , one puppet theater , one operetta company , and a philharmonic ? While in Krakow , I noticed advertisements for three current plays by Aeschylus , Shakespeare , and Shaw . A young friend just graduated from the Krakow Beaux Arts , where he studied stage designing , has his first job as one of the designers for the largest Krakow theater , a whopping place with a huge auditorium . He showed me his sketches for the costumes and sets of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imaginative warriors ' costumes , which will be made of silvered cardboard , cheesecloth , dyed horsehair plumes ; movable panels to suggest the camp of the Greek army , the battlements of Troy , nothing but painted beaverboard giving a heroic impression of space and power . " It is a very interesting play to the people , " he said , " because of the political allusions . " This boy earns the equivalent of twenty dollars a month , which means that he lives on scraps , but he is happy because he has the greatest possible luxury , a room of his own . It is a real attic , with a small skylight for air and light , a chair , a table , a cot , a bookcase ; and one part of the room is high enough to stand up in . The washing facilities are distant and lamentable . Young Poles have never known even rudimentary ease ; for twenty years the main problem has been to eat . They do not think in material terms ; our Beatniks would seem luxurious pampered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money , nor the prospect of having it , is to cherish more fiercely the values of the mind . So this boy , who does not dream of a better physical existence , dreams of ballet , and notably of American ballet . He eats even less and saves to buy ballet books that are published in New York . They cost a terrible lot , by his starvation standards ; he owns four of them . The Poles do not ask favors , they prefer to offer them ; pride is part of their bravery . My young friend knotted himself in apologies before he could bring out his one vital request . " Could you ask Mr. Jerome Robbins if he would have me do a set and costumes ? I do not want money ; I would be happy to give . I wish only to work for him . " Sadly , I had to point out that life did not function exactly like this in America , and also I did not know Mr. Robbins . Privately , I doubted whether at his age , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anywhere in America to do the work he does in Krakow . No one believes that the State ? in its concrete form , the high Communist bureaucracy ? is a devoted lover of the arts . The State merely refuses to waste its money on what it considers junk ; the Poles wo n't endure being bored ; the result of these two different viewpoints is exciting , good art . I think the Polish public is better trained and more eager than we are and wants more from art than we do ; and it is nobly served by its artists . In my opinion , the culture ? odious word ? in its quality , quantity , and availability , is the most laudable aspect of this regime . The Poles would probably say they have wrested their culture from the State , they have made it because it is in them , and that would be true ; but the culture is there , and although the State pays misery wages for it , as for all else , still , it pays . CULTURE rests on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fascinating mystery . ' here are twice as many universities as before the war . I have no statistics on student population , but the small city of Krakow alone has forty thousand students , of university level . Entrance examinations are the same throughout the country and very stiff ; no laggards are allowed to remain in classrooms . And beyond all the formal schooling , the sense of a whole people clamoring for and gulping down education is something you feel as a fact , like the weather . I sought enlightenment ; when you want a thoughtful point of view you go to the opposition , the Catholic liberal elite . I put my questions to a man of generally recognized fairness and intelligence . " Why is n't Communism sowing dragon 's teeth with all this education ? If education does nothing else , it teaches people to ask , ' Why ? ' And not only does the State provide so much education , but apparently it permits real education , not the teaching of dogma to parrots . Is n't this a crazy risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Communists here , anyway . They 're going to get a nation of free , liberal intellectuals . " It should be noted that this man is an honorable anti-Communist and bears no relation to the horrible world-wide crew of professional anti-Communists once headed by Hitler , ably abetted by the late Senator McCarthy , now recently joined by Dr. Verwoerd . Many and very nasty people are anti-Communist because they are natural Fascists who:see in Communism a power threat to their own repulsive dreams of power , or use Communism as a handy word for smearing all dissenters . This man is pure in his rejection of Communism , and for my part , I stand with people like him who hate Communism because they believe in humanity , one by one , the only way it comes . Peace and dignity , responsibility and freedom are what we want for ourselves , and so for all other men . The genuine anti-Communists know that the end never justifies the means , in terms of human life . We are accountable for the means ; the end is always lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as of Fascism , are inhuman . His answer astonished me : " Of all the bad things anyone can say about Communism , I do not think you can say that they want to keep people stupid so as to control them . " I asked him to repeat this , I found it so startling , both as coming from him and as an unexpected revelation of hope for the world . " The Communists may have believed that a middle intelligentsia , half educated but thinking itself educated , would be better prepared to swallow their ideology whole . But of course , so far , this does not work . " There is little or no material advantage , for a Pole , in being educated , yet educated people are the aristocracy of the classless society . There is also no such thing , and never can be any such thing , as a classless society ; men , luckily , are not equal . The Poles are equal enough in poverty , but any bright young . Pole would rather be an underpaid intellectual than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a young man in a cafe in Nowa Huta , which is the modern steel town the State has built outside Krakow . This eighteen-year-old was enrolled in the law faculty of Krakow University ; his father was a steelworker . He announced that after Ile had finished law he would like to study philosophy , and after that he would like to become a journalist . I was thinking how cross a normal capitalist father would be , having to pay for all this education , and , besides , quite unnecessary education , as we journalists would be the first to testify . How much does it cost ? I wondered . Tuition is fourteen dollars a year . Adding up , generously , we figured that with books , carfare , lunches , some clothes , some spending money , he cost his father sixty dollars a year , which is a lot , a very good month 's wage in Poland . The young man ? delightful soft voice , open face , the usual manners of all classes in this " classless society , " which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , innate politeness ? seemed unworried by his father 's financial problems . He loves sports , jazz , movies : the international freemasonry of youth . He reads classical drama for pleasure . He wanted to know whether America was as beautiful as he had heard . Then he wanted to know whether people lived very nervous lives there ; he had also heard this . ( Few Americans would deny that life is needlessly nervous in God 's Own Country ; but few of us could take what Polish nerves do , and have to . ) Change this boy 's clothes , teach him English , and he would be one of the better-bred , more intellectually alert freshmen at Princeton . SOMEONE said , " Do you want to see a peasants ' university ? " and indeed I did , so off we went , I and three Poles who had never heard of such an institution , although they lived twenty miles from it . We arrived at an old shabby country manor and found that this house sheltered sixty students who come for seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their high schools . Throughout Poland there are ten such peasants ' universities , based , we were told , on the Danish model . The couple who ran this school reminded me of the best type of Quakers ; in fifteen years they have graduated 2200 students . They have many more applications than they can accept : young men , back home in their villages , send their fiancees to this school , wishing their future wives to have the same advantages they had ; . alumni bring their children for visits ; the local peasants pour in on Sunday afternoons for coffee and cake and discussions with the undergraduates . The school has no other aim than to set the mind free . It wants to make whole people . It believes , evidently , that truth is beauty , beauty truth , and in a modest way it tries to show students something of the wide world of the mind . After which , the students return to their small poor villages and share this new knowledge , this vision ; and they are gladly welcomed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems too happily good to be real , but it is real . For seven months , these boys and girls study dancing , painting , singing , acting ; they take courses in geography and history . But above all , they are encouraged to read . Sometimes a student will read fifty books during his stay , sometimes seven ; no pressure is exerted . The library is a good one . The students organize almost nightly book evenings , at which one of them reviews what he has read . The schedule of these literary gatherings was tacked on the principal 's wall : Balzac , Dickens , Dostoyevsky , Conrad , Hemingway are the foreign authors I remember . One night a student had reviewed a life of Lenin ; there was no other indication of politics . We were treated to a heavenly show of old Polish folk dal-cing and singing , in costume . When we left , a small group of students were preparing a play for that night ; they had dramatized Goethe 's Sorrows of Werther and were about to stage it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever costumes they had invented and sewed . No one had told them to do this or helped them ; the teachers arrive at the evening entertainment as visitors . There it is . I can not explain it or fit it into any preconceived notions ; I only know it exists . My three Polish chums were as amazed and impressed as I was . A gentle bourgeois housewife teaches English in a Krakow public school , to earn some extra money . She has twelve students , aged eleven to thirteen , and for two hours twice a week they slug away at the job with rapt attention . Within three months they can take simple English dictation without making mistakes . She says it is wonderful to teach them , they are so clever , so eager to learn . ? What she reports seems to me a sort of miracle ; try thinking of it in reverse , our children learning Polish . The professor from the medical school at Krakow is , as they always politely say in Poland , " over sixty . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very great people in Europe , and he was accustomed to quite an elegant standard of life . His university will celebrate its six hundredth anniversary in 1964 ; it is Ivy League in Poland , a famous center of learning . He does n't so much talk as explode with energy ; he shouted joyfully that , in his work , it is a thousand times better than before the war . There are now ten medical faculties instead of five , no trouble- with politics for the last five years , all the money you want for research , every scientific publication from all over the world , colleagues coming from the West to visit ; Ile himself does not want money , he has time only for work ; what is bad is that the young assistants are not paid enough , very bad ; and they lack foreign exchange to buy equipment in the West ; but there are more students with more chances , and young doctors can go to the country , where they are needed ; and snake a good living . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marvelous man . I thought it fine Polish-funny that if you wanted a miner 's point of view in Katowice you searched out your man in a night club . In a vast , ill-lit , dingy hall ( standard for popular night clubs ) , the younger mining set was doing frantic rock-'n ' - roll and did not look suitable for serious conversation . We found a very correct , nice , pudgy middle-aged man who turned out to be in the engineering section of the mine . He reads technical material in English , German , and Russian , but he is not a university graduate ; he is a plain worker . Perhaps the final comment on education in Poland was made by an old peasant woman who lived in a meadow by a brook , in a log and plaster cottage painted pale blue , with a thatched roof . I loved the looks of this place and the inside of her house , with its big yellow tile stove for heating and cooking , its oil lamps . I thought this was the nearest I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was as jolly as a grig ; everything was right , her kerchief , her heavy boots , her large wool skirts , her lined face , her small gay blue eyes , her voice like a cackling giggling croak . We brought vodka with us , as a help to knocking on doors and asking personal questions of strangers , and this worked like a charm ? not that any private person would refuse to let you in and to answer anything you asked . She wanted mainly and disconnectedly to talk of her sister , who had been in Auschwitz and was always ill , sick with the concentration-camp sickness ? terrible changes in the body induced by starvation , which end , by some metabolic twist , as disabling obesity ; her sister could not take a job where she had to stay in one room . This old woman 's life can never have been anything but stony hardship , ? nd it is the same now ; she would not think it worth while to complain . But suddenly she said , " I can only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to school . " ILOVE and admire the Poles , and for their sake I wish I could report that life is better in Poland , more room to breathe , more hope , and more money . In 1958 , there seemed little enough of those commodities , and now it is worse . " Everyone is sick of politics , " said Antoni . " All they care about is making money . " " And do they ? " " Oh , no , of course not . There is always less money . And prices go up and wages stay the same , or else , plop , they go down . And many people have no jobs . But there is no unemployment relief , because in a Communist State there can be no unemployment . And the labor exchanges do not find people work . It is a joke , no ? " " Since I 'm not . Polish , the answer is No . " " Many people are becoming Communists now , just for the sake of a job . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should at least be sincere , do n't you agree ? " A year and a half ago , we talked a great deal about the past war , about Russia , about fear of another war , even occasionally about the Polish government . This time , topic number one was economics , which is the nagging desperate preoccupation of the Poles . When they say they are interested in making money , they mean they are interested in staying alive . People exist who can write intelligently about Marxist economics . To the ignorant outside observer , Marxist economics in Poland seems like a mad doctrinaire system , unrelated to human life or human nature , which is designed to keep people ' , miserably poor . The State , the overall paymaster , does not pay a living wage . And meantime , it hounds the pitiful relicts of private enterprise that have somehow survived . ( A miller by a stream : since the last of the Polish Kings , over two hundred years ago , his family has owned and operated an ancient wooden water wheel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a threat to any economic system . A wiser state ? we will skip the idea of a kinder state ? would even consider this man and his mill wheel as art objects to be preserved . He is being chevied out of existence by taxes ; one small man lost in the countryside , one man with a handsome mourning face who sees the end of his line . ) Communist economics in Poland apparently works like Prohibition in America . Prohibition made the United States a nation of ihegal drinkers ; Communist economics forces the Poles to be finaglers , cheats , little or big crooks . If a charwoman is paid ten dollars a month for full-time work , she must obviously have several jobs or starve . So she checks in at two or more jobs , works a little , and badly , at each , and lives . If a janitor who shovels coal into boilers all night in the ravaging Polish climate earns sixteen dollars a month , he must obviously steal some of the coal to sell it on the black market , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scale of employment , you can rob more from the State , and be caught and go to jail : a visit to the law courts any day will confirm this . " The most honest woman you could ever know , " I heard , " she is in prison for embezzling . She did it for everyone else where she worked , too ; she had to help them . " " We are all honest here , " said the peasant woman who rents rooms in her house for vacationing city people ; she could not make a living off the farm . " But in the next village , someone robbed the co-op . " " Oh , well , " said the driver of our hired car , " they were only stealing from the State , not from real people . " Terror changes its face ; for the past few years , there have been no political trials . In fact , what use is political rebellion of any kind ? The Poles know their catastrophic geography and their ruthless neighbor . Now the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-being , for legally there should be none . Lawyers , organized into cooperatives , have private practices , with a fixed scale of fees ; but they must not earn more than sixty dollars a month . A peasant remarked , " If you wear a pair of good trousers , they follow you to see where you got the money . " A year later , a man is ominously questioned as to how he managed to buy a car for his work . The ever-present , ever-menacing State , which taps telephones , opens mail , searches rooms , follows people , seems turned into a suspicious cash register with an X-ray eye . Those who have nothing must go on having nothing . I do n't pretend to understand what purpose or excuse there can be for such economics ; I only know the atmosphere ? anxiety , disgust , hopelessness ? and the visible results . Dirt and neglect : oh , the bad food and scruffy rooms , the broken plumbing , the filthy , slow , overloaded trains , the antique planes with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoddy goods at the absurd prices ; and why not , why not ? I also think that the pitiful drunkenness of the poor ? half the ragged cotton-clad farmers in a squalid village pub dead drunk at two o'clock on a Monday afternoon , shabby men reeling dangerously in the dark streets ? is due to this antihuman economics . If you can not earn enough for a clect nt life and can no longer hope , you can at least get drunk . The State 's solution is to raise the price of vodka , not wages . When , by some miracle of good sense , a living wage is paid , the effect is of light flooding into darkness . One day we were following the usual custom of knocking on strangers ' doors and were thus let into a flat in Nowa Huta . It was a clean one-room dwelling for a young man , his wile , and baby ( plus kitchen and bath ; rent $1.72 a month ) . The young man was a mason ; starting here as an unskilled worker at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten years in building these vast complexes of gray cement sardine tins and was now earning fifty-six dollars a month . That is more than a judge earns in Poland . He had medals for good workmanship , of which he was shyly proud . He reads six or seven newspapers a day and saves them . He loves the movies ( favorites : Hitchcock 's Rear Window , Francis , the " talking mule , " and anything with Eartha Kitt ) . He had two books out from the lending library : Feuerbach 's Essence of Religion and The Count of Monte Cristo . Once a month he goes to the theater ? there is an especially fine one at Nowa Huta ; to the movies three or four times a week ; he watches and plays soccer . He is a contented man and a hard , competent worker . The State should arrive , in pilgrimage , and study this man and try to learn from him the basic truths about human needs , human hopes , human nature . THE Communist Founding Fathers and their latter-day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it as weak , contemptible , not here to stay . The result is a perpetual war between the State , which does not care for individuals , and the people , who continue to be individuals since they can not deny their nature and become sheep . The most obvious battlefront in this war is religion . You can not push your way into any church in Poland on Sunday morning ; overflow crowds stand outside the doors listening to distant liturgy and music . Anyone , except the State , would realize what the Catholic Church means to the majority of Poles , to each one alone , in his heart . But the State does not learn about people ; it only interferes with them . The last stupidity of the State produced a riot . This happened at Nowa Huta , and none of us saw it because the police arrested all journalists who appeared on the scene . About eight hours in the clink for foreigners ; no news of what became of foolhardy Poles . We heard about it within fifteen minutes of its start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was printed in the papers for three days , and finally only a dotty paragraph which spoke of " irresponsible elements . " Nowa Huta is the State 's favorite showpiece ; the steelworks are reputed to be first class , and though the housing is hideous , it is habitable , and there are special advantages ? the theater , movies , a cabaret , cafes , library , sports grounds , and so on . The peasantry was then uprooted , brought here , taught skilled work , and paid well . Nowa Huta was meant to be an example of the brave new Communist world . The State did not , of course , build a church . There are 110,000 people living in Nowa Huta , and they collected money amongst themselves to build a church , which must have depressed the State . They had a plot next to the theater ; a cross was raised and foundations partly dug . One morning three workmen arrived and began to dismantle the cross . Workers ' wives , in nearby flats , saw this and rushed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had decided to build a school here , which was more necessary . The housewives hurled themselves on the unlucky workmen and beat them with bits of the cross ; in no time there were 30,000 people rioting . They burned the Nowa Huta city hall , which is standard operational procedure when rioting ; the object is to burn all the dossiers . They fought the police and some contingents of the army who were called in . There was n't a policeman left in Krakow . Reports from Krakow residents who lived near the military hospital said that there was a heavy traffic of ambulances . Truckloads of workers were seen driving off to jail . Curfew was declared at Nowa Huta . There were excited rumors of a partial strike at the steelworks . After four days , the cross was back in its place . The workers would have their church . People laughed and congratulated each other in the streets of Krakow ; this was a victory for human nature . COMMUNIST countries are prisons in the simplest sense ; people are not allowed freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to . Since 1956 , Poland has been a prison with small doors opening to the West ; much better than the doorless prison lands . But the Communist rulers ' attitude toward travel in the open world is not only a total admission of failure ? contented people need not be denied the right to roam ; it also proves their contempt for human needs , or indifference , to them . People can not bear to be locked up . Maybe they would not be able to travel if they were free to do so ; money is problem everywhere . What eats into the soul is the sense of being trapped . If a Pole can arrange to be invited by someone , preferably a relative , living in the West who will pay for his round-trip ticket in hard currency and guarantee to support him while he is away , he can , with luck , and after both his and his host 's massive struggles against red tape , get a passport . ' This may take anywhere from three months to a year and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars ( I have no idea why there is this price range ) and is valid for a short period , a few . months . And the Poles long to travel in our world ; not to leave Poland forever , but only to breathe another air for a while , see another life , learn . They have been jailed for twenty years . A young painter asked me where I had been since last he saw me . I tried to remember the countries : various visits to France , Italy , Spain , Switzerland , all over America . He laughed as if I had told him a magical tale , something between the Arabian Nights and the best joke of the year . He laughed with joy to think that all the countries were there and that someone he knew could actually go to them . He no longer talks of traveling himself . I heard of a man who had been coping for over a year with the maddening , wearing obstacles put in the way of travel ; at last he had his passport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whereupon the police advised him that it would be better not to go . Why ? No reason . At this point , sane people go almost insane from the stupid , oppressive frustration of it all . My informant said , " It is not now like eyes burned out or somezing like zat ; it is only ze tedium , ze tedium , it sacks ze nerves . " Every day these people are forced into contact with the deadly , cheap , E. Phillips Oppenheim spy-story mentality of the State . Every day they have to swallow sickening doses of illogical bureaucracy , a bureaucracy which is Kafka mixed with Asiatic deviousness . And what for , what for ? What does the State want ? Clearly , everyone is guilty until proved innocent ( crime not specified ) . Is the sole intention of all this hateful , invisible controlling to intimidate the Poles ? It intimidates me all right ; it does not intimidate the Poles . The enslaving State is itself a slave of the Russian master ; and Russian government has relied for centuries on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long-term hope of the Poles is that the Russian people will demand more and more personal freedom ; more human dignity , and so , by contagion , government in Poland might eventually become an open , daylight business . One night , four of us were having a feast in a room like a stage set : it was an abject-poverty room , a tiny cell in a dark , dirty , overcrowded flat on an ugly street . There was an iron cot , three folding chairs , a table , an unshaded light bulb , and we were gloriously happy . I have n't been to such a good party since the last time I was in Poland . Our host , the youngest of the three young Poles , had spent his money , to my anxiety , on lots of bread and butter , some salami , a tin of sardines , withered apples , and vodka . We sat in the cold room , on the hard chairs and harder bed , for five perfect hours , eating , drinking , and laughing . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I learned much of great importance to me . " The worst hotel rooms are supposed to be those with numbers ending in 2 , " I said . " It 's so revolting and so pointless ; and where are the mikes ? And coming back to a hotel in the north and asking for your key , and the brute of a police agent at the desk says you must have taken it with you ; but you could n't take any room key anywhere in Poland ? either it has a wooden turnip attached to it or a ring like a handcuff . Then the second police desk clerk arrives with your key in his hand and says blandly he was just checking to see if the room was still occupied . And never daring to speak anyone 's name on the telephone , not that you have anything to say except ' Where shall we meet ? ' but you 're afraid someday they 'll get in trouble because they 've talked to you . " I was breathless ; I had been at it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they looked uncomfortable .

It becomes a form of entertainment for us . It is much more irritating if you can never get the sort of shoe polish you want . " The others laughed , the conversation changed , and I stood deeply corrected . I had behaved like someone who comes , for a few hours , to the front , where others live in constant peril , and babbles fear , spreading panic or dismay . This is not acceptable behavior at any front , nor in Poland . What the Poles ' private secret feelings may be I do not know ; singly and collectively they are sardonic about the hazards of their lives , always a little more weary , unyielding . I listened to my friends and thought of all the Poles I knew or had met in passing . I thought of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different forms of tyranny has not chipped away . Each person owns his mind , and they are original , interesting minds , too . Bits of conversation , pictures of places float about in my memory : the entrancing barmaid , who looked like a Bryn Mawr Brigitte Bardot , teaching historical fact to a long , lean , foolish young American . He was saying , " It 's better to get any story over with . In a week , who is going to remember Chessman ? " " I disagree , " she said . " Do n't you remember the Rosenbergs ? People will remember Chessman . " The taxi driver who spoke perfect Italian ; his father had been killed by the Gerinans as a Communist ; he himself hates all politics . He wished he could have met in his life Jack London and Hemingway ; he had all their books in Polish and Italian . He admired America ? " all Poles do " ? but he deplored " the war against the Negroes in America . That is not good ; that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes if they stopped that war . " The student 's cabaret , in a small , vaulted , grimy , cellar : could not understand a word and grasped at snippets of translation , but even with such a handicap it seemed to me wildly , irreverentlyfunny and professional , better than any expensive night-club show I could remember . In the middle , the young performers sang " in honor of our American friend " Tipperary in Russian , to the howling delight of the audience , which continues to regard anything in Russian as automatically , killingly comical . " Antoni , " I said , " could you ever live outside Poland ? " " No , I would not even try . " The evils that befall their country have no effect on the love of the Poles for their country , which is unique in the line of passionate patriotism . I think , at last , I know why . The very evils that befall them , and have through the centuries , and most cruelly these last twenty years , feed the love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ History treats Poles almost as specially and nearly as badly as it treats Jews . In another , very different room , a Pole , whom history had flung about from Manchuria to Lithuania to Brazil , said , " If our country were rich and happy , we could all go away . But. , as it is not , we will never leave it . " " Julek , " I asked , " have you ever been bored ? " " I do n't know . Perhaps I have been bored all my life without knowing it . But what arc you to do if you are kept waiting for half an hour in a restaurant ? Hang yourself ? " Great backhanded compliments can be paid to poverty , suffering , and oppression : if they do n't kill , they sharpen the mind and strengthen the spirit . The sharpened mind is lively , hungry , daring , and singularly free . The strengthened spirit is generous , loyal , grateful for life and for any small chance blessing . A visit to Poland is like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highly therapeutic step . You remember again the splendor of human courage , and you learn humility . I wonder if this is any sort of balance sheet on what is good and what is bad in Polish life today .
