txt  | tween activities ; but the effort is amply rewarded by the production of a detailed works schedule in which problems of labor and equipment and financial fluctuations are overcome as far as practicable . In chains of activities involving numerous operations , with various labor requirements and skills and different types of equipment , the most satisfactory way of carrying out detailed resource leveling is to begin with the labor craft ( or major equipment item ) having the greatest fluctuations . Smoothing this out first , without regard to other skills or equipment , one then proceeds with a second craft ( or piece of equipment ) , and so on , one skill ( or machine ) at a time , until a satisfactory overall labor and equipment force is attained . With complex chains the same craft or machine may have to be reviewed several times and relevant activities shifted and reshifted before an acceptable solution appears . As pointed out , the best approach is first to shift those activities with small float and then those with large float . In drawing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is often helpful to sketch in ( as on a critical path bar chart ) the time ranges available for all the noncritical activities ; this will ensure not making any incompatible decisions during the activity shifting procedure , especially when reshifting is found necessary . An alternative aid , preferred by some planners , is to block out all times not available for the execution of each activity . Finally , once the ultimate works schedule is determined , financial expenditure and income may also be added to the resource leveling tabulation , as demonstrated in Section 10.2 ; in this way the estimator can present a complete picture of all the essential resources in strict conformity with the network model . 7.3 SCHEDULING FOR TIME LIMITATIONS Normally , CPM is used to plan a project so that it will be carried out in the minimum economic time ; it has been shown in Chapters 5 and 6 how compression and decompression enable the project duration ( and cost ) to be varied to determine this time . In many projects , however , certain events must be completed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enable the network analysis to be valid under such circumstances , it is necessary to show such time constraints on the diagram by means of artificial activities . Figure 7.4 shows a project network in which it is specified that event 7 must be achieved within 20 weeks of the commencement of work , event 15 is to be achieved within 12 weeks thereafter , and the entire project must be completed in not more than 48 weeks . The activities 0-7 , 7 - 15 , and 15 ? 20 are therefore artificial activities denoting such time constraints ,  | figure the total durations of these three equaling the specified project duration of 48 weeks . The relevant events 7 , 15 , and 20 are known as milestone events , and are shown as double circles to distinguish them from the ordinary nodes . This network would first be analyzed in the usual way to determine the most economical solution for the scheduling of events 7 , 15 , and 20 ( ignoring the presence of the three time constraint activities ) . If this solution conforms with the three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then each subnetwork is crashed as appropriate until the artificial time activities are all critical . It will be clear that this use of artificial time limitation activities enables the duration between any two or more events to be controlled . 7.4 EFFECT OF RESOURCE LIMITATIONS ON PROJECT DURATIONS : RESOURCE SCHEDULING Inherent in the initial approach to critical path network analysis is the assumption that the resource requirements for the various activities can be met , whenever required , from the available project resources , independently of the requirements of other concurrent activities . If this is not the case , and if the network diagram does not properly so indicate in its logic ( such as by the use of crew and equipment constraints ) , then the basis for the determination of the critical path will be invalid . When resources are strictly limited , the situation can arise where chains that are otherwise noncritical must exceed their total float while waiting for their special resources to become available , thus delaying the entire project . Consider the case shown in Figure 7.5 in which activities 2-3 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with other activities requiring crew sizes as indicated . The minimum project duration is 15 weeks , and all activities are classified as continuous operations . It can be shown ( excluding the subcontractor 's forces ) that the maximum number of men required at any stage of the project to meet this duration with an earliest start schedule is 140 men ; by resource leveling within the available floats this can be reduced to a maximum of 90 men , using the procedure described in Section 7.2 . Suppose , however , that for some reason ( for example , a management constraint ) it is necessary to restrict the maximum manpower requirement to 70 men in addition to the subcontractor 's forces . The procedure follows that explained in Section 7.2 , except that , when float is no longer available , critical and noncritical activities must be further shifted and reshifted until the minimum project duration is achieved without exceeding the imposed manpower limitation . Table 7.4 shows the solution to this resource scheduling problem . The critical activities are scheduled first , followed by noncritical activities in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the earliest start schedule in the first instance . The first step , designated ( a ) in Table 7.4 , is to shift activities 1 ? 2 ( and 2 ? 3 ) , 3 ? 6 , 1 ? 7 , and 7 ? 8 within the limits of their available float , since critical activity 1 ? 4 requires 60 men and all other activities require more than 10 men ; manpower is now satisfactory to the end of week 7 , the position shown in row ( I ) in the table . The next step ( b ) is to shift activity 7 ? 8 ( and hence critical activity 8 ? 9 ) beyond its available float to reduce the manpower requirement below the specified 70 until the end of week 10 , the smallest shift of critical activity 8 ? 9 being 3 weeks ( that is , the float overrun of activity  | figure 7-8 ) . This current situation is shown in row ( II ) in the table . Since the project duration is now 18 weeks , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ additional float , and can be further shifted within this amount as shown in step ( c ) . The situation is now summarized in row ( III ) of the table and satisfies the imposed manpower limitation . Hence the minimum project duration under these circumstances is 18 weeks , an increase of 3 weeks due solely to the resource limitation . If desired , the subcontract activity 2-3 can be further shifted so that it will follow activity 4-5 , for 6 weeks float is still available to it . With this additional subcontractor constraint , the final network for this project will be as seen in Figure 7.6 ; the nodes must , of course , be renumbered . It is important to note that the network must be reanalyzed for float each time available floats are exceeded . An alternative resource leveling procedure is to examine the project in successive steps of one time unit at a time , shifting chains of activities as required at each step until a valid solution appears for each successive time unit examined ; activity-shifting begins with the chain having the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again the problem shown in Figure 7.5 . Table 7.5 is prepared with all activities scheduled for EST in their order of increasing float ( as in Table 7.4 ) , and the EST manpower requirements are listed for each time unit . It is seen immediately that the manpower limitation of 70 men is violated from the outset ( week 1 ) . Hence the chains 1-7-8 and 1-2-3- 6 ( in that order ) are shifted 1 week to the right to give a valid solution for week 1 : the manpower position is then as shown at the bottom of Table 7.5 after  | step 1 . The next step is to examine week 2 ; chains 1 ? 7 ? 8 and 1 ? 2 ? 3 ? 6 are again shifted one week to give the manpower position noted in Table 7.5 after step 2 . For steps 3 and 4 ( weeks 3 and 4 ) it is necessary only to shift chain 1 ? 7 ? 8 to reduce the manpower requirement to 70 men . These and subsequent steps are not shown in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reader to develop the final solution as an exerciser ; this will appear as designated in row ( III ) of Table 7.4 . The initial stages , outlined above , of the superposition of a limited resource logic for the project of Figure 7.5 can be represented on the network diagram . Figure 7.7 shows the situation initially ( a ) ; and at the end of the second ( b ) and third ( c ) weekly time intervals . Both arrow and circle networks are shown , and it is clear that for changes in logic , circle notation is superior . Note that it may be possible to suppress initial technology logic ( now superseded by resource logic ) to reduce the number of arrows in the diagrams ; however , it must be recognized that if this reduction is effected , some information is lost and may have to be regenerated at a later stage . The resource scheduling procedure outlined above can be generalized and formulated as follows : Consider two activities A and B as shown in Figure 7.8 in general CPM bar chart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and B only when both activities are working during any specific time interval and not otherwise , then the conflict can be 1 For week 5 no shifting is required . For weeks 6 and 7 only activity 7 ? 8 is shifted , reaching the end of its float and becoming critical . No shifting within remaining floats will satisfy week 8 ; consequently , the critical path and project time must be extended . For week 8 shift activity 7 ? 8 ( and 8 ? 9 , both critical ) , and for weeks 9 and 10 shift activities 7 ? 8 ( with 8 ? 9 ) and 3 ? 6 ; notice that the chains 1 ? 2 ? 3 ? 6 and 4 ? 5 ? 6 ? 9 have now gained 3 weeks additional float . Hence for weeks 11 , 12 , and 13 shift activities 3 ? 6 and 6 9 ; weeks 14 to 18 will also be satisfactory , and a valid solution has been found . The leveling of subcontract activities 4 ? 5 and 2 ? 3 can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to follow A , or A to follow B. Obviously , it is better to select the sequence that increases the project duration the least . If B is to follow A , then the best strategy is to schedule A as soon as possible ( that is , at ESTA ) and B as soon as A is finished ( that is , at EFTA ) . The increase in project duration TP then becomes figure The second equation means that no project extension results since B can be shifted after A within the float available to B. Similarly , if A is to follow B , then the increase in project duration becomes figure The best scheduling sequence is then readily determined . If more than two activities are simultaneously involved in a resource conflict , a systematic evaluation , similar to that indicated above , becomes necessary for each possible scheduling sequence . Since the result of each search is to order two activities only , the process may have to be repeated again and again until the resource conflict has been removed . Before proceeding to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeated on the new network model to obtain updated values of EST , LST , EFT , LFT for the network activities . The method then continues on through all the remaining time intervals in the project . It is interesting to note that if the resource scheduling strategy is adopted of not shifting " in progress " activities , then equations ( 7.3 ) and ( 7.4 ) shift resource-conflict activities in the total float order . Thus if activities B and C simultaneously enter in resource conflict with " in progress " activity A , then equations ( 7.3 ) and ( 7.4 ) yield : figure Thus the activity with largest total float is shifted in sequence first . Limitations of manpower , finance , equipment , or other resources frequently occur in practice . Sometimes these resource limitations can be incorporated into the network logic by means of dummies or allowed for by skillful resource leveling . When this is not possible , the project duration is increased and the usual critical path ( based on unlimited resources ) may be radically altered , as can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is therefore obvious that , in some realistic diagrams , the critical path , although still being the most time-consuming path through the network , is not easily determined , for it depends on the availability of a wide variety of resources and on the network characteristics . For a limitation in maximum allowable financial expenditure during construction , the procedures are similar to those for a maximum manpower limitation , using either of the methods illustrated in Tables 7.4 and 7.5 , except that the estimated cost per unit time for each activity is substituted for the crew size in compiling the tabulation . Activity shifting and summation of requirements will follow , until the final totals are found to lie within the specified financial limitation . With equipment limitations either of these procedures can be adopted , and indeed manpower and equipment limitations can often be handled simultaneously ( as done in Table 7.3 ) , whether available floats have to be exceeded or not . It is simply a matter of logical activity shifting and reshifting until the desired result appears . Another method of handling equipment limitations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crews , is illustrated by considering the small network diagram shown in Figure 7.9a . Associated with each activity is a duration tij and a resource requirement Rij for its duration . Figure 7.9b presents the development of the critical path in the usual way , based on the assumption that unlimited resources are available . The actual resources necessary for this project duration of 32 days are two sets of equipment I and one set of equipment II , as presented in Figure 7.9c . The second set of equipment I is required for only approximately one-fifth of the project time , and this requirement can not be reduced by activity shifting within the available floats . Now suppose that only one set of equipment I exists ( or can be made available ) . Consequently , the network diagram in Figure 7.9b is logically incorrect and that of Figure 7.10 must be substituted . Notice that con-  | siderable alterations have been made to ensure that correct logic holds for the special resource limitations now imposed on the project . The determination of the critical path then proceeds as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This increase of 4 days is attributable directly to the imposed resource limitation . The actual cost of this enforced delay can be determined , if necessary , for comparison with other alternative construction methods ( if any are feasible ) . It is important to appreciate that both network diagrams ( Figures 7.9b and 7.10 ) are logically correct in their respective portrayal of their different resource constraints . In both diagrams the critical paths are validly determined as critical time paths , that of the second network differing from the first solely because of the network characteristics and the resource constraints . The price paid for the imposition of the equipment limitation is thus the increase in project duration , as was the case for the manpower limitation example ( Figures 7.5 and 7.6 ) . 7.5 SIMULATION NETWORKS FOR RESOURCE LIMITATIONS In projects with highly interconnected networks and varied resources , it is virtually impossible to anticipate and incorporate all the resource constraints that may become necessary . A realistic approach is then to formulate a network that resembles the usual diagram in its presentation of the valid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time providing for the control on network timing and critical paths dictated by the imposed resource limitations . Such a network is a special type of arrow diagram incorporating appropriate resource  | availability and utilization graphs . The analysis of the network proceeds under the constraints dictated by the resource graphs and thus has features related to simulation ; consequently , this type of network is referred to as a simulation network . In this network , each separate resource considered in the project has an individual resource availability graph , showing to what extent in time and numbers it is available in the project . During the scheduling of the work , as soon as an activity has been assigned a resource for a specific period , this resource utilization is recorded on the resource availability graph , thus indicating whether and when the particular resource will be available for other activities . Before any activity using project resources can commence , the necessary resources must be available . Such activities in a simulation network are called conditional activities . The arrow representing this kind of activity incorporates near its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to question the availability of the essential resources required for this activity . For instance , suppose an activity needs n sets of equipment X in order to finish in its all-normal duration ; the question at the test-box is : " Are n sets of the equipment X available now ? " If the answer is " Yes , " the activity can commence ; if " No , " the activity must wait , or be deferred , until the equipment becomes available . It therefore follows that , with this simulation network concept , the critical path determination proceeds hand in hand with resource scheduling and may have to be revised several times if unwanted characteristics develop . To illustrate the technique for the problem postulated in Figure 7.10 , a simulation network diagram , together with its associated resource availability and utilization graphs for the equipments I and II , is shown in Figure 7.11 . The comparison of these two network diagrams demonstrates that the constraint dummies of Figure 7.10 ( which were logically required for the specific resource allocation concerned ) are no longer necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at the expense of continual close correlation of the usual network calculations with the relevant resource graph during the entire network analysis . In this particular problem , various schedules are possible , depending on the preliminary precedence in allocating resources to the activities ; that used in Figure 7.11 gives preference to full utilization of equipment I and precedence to activity 2 ? 3 over activity 2 ? 4 , both of which require equipment I.1 ' Having mastered this technique , the reader should reschedule this project , giving precedence to the full utilization of equipment II as far as possible , and should also consider nonuniform resource availability graphs .  | figure The method of calculation will be clear from the following logical approach . On starting with activity 0-1 ( requiring one set of equipment I for 8 days ) , the answer as to equipment availability at day 0 is " Yes " ; hence this activity proceeds and the availability and utilization graph for equipment I is blocked out for 8 days with activity 0-1 , as shown . The situation is similar for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Proceeding to activity 1-3 ( requiring equipment II for ( i days , starting at day 8 ) , the answer from the availability and utilization graph for equipment II is " Yes , " and thus it is scheduled as shown ; notice that the El ' ' T of event 3 by this chain 0-1-3 is 14 days  | at this stage of the calculations . When activity 2 ? 3 is considered ( requiring equipment I for 7 days ) , the answer from the graph at day 5 is " No , " so the start of this activity must wait for 3 days ( to day 8 when the answer will be " Yes " ) ; this is recorded on the simulation network , making the EFT for event 3 now equal to 15 days ( 5 + 3 + 7 ) . Similarly , for activity 2 ? 4 the answer at day 5 is " No , " but since at day 15 it will be " Yes , " a 10-day wait is necessary . This procedure is repeated step by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached at day 36 . Notice the intermittent use of equipment II and the full employment of equipment I. The most interesting development is that the critical path is no longer a continuous chain through the simulation network ; the usual continuity of Figure 7.10 has become the discontinuous path of Figure 7.11 because the resource constraint dummies are no longer inserted in the simulation network diagram . When resource limitations affect the project duration , the critical sequence becomes a combination of those activities lying on the critical time path and those on the critical resource path and is thus called the composite critical path . The technique of using simulation networks can be employed for any project where fixed limitations may exist in manpower , equipment , finance , or other resources . The simpler problems may be solved by manual calculations as shown above ; the complex situations will need computers . 7.6 COMPRESSION OF SIMULATION NETWORKS WITH RESOURCE LIMITATIONS An interesting development in network compression techniques is the optimal compression of simulation networks with imposed resource limitations . Once resources are allocated to a project and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , with simulation networks , there is an added complication in that , if critical resource paths develop , additional limitations are imposed on available compressions by the temporarily ( or permanently ) unavailable resources . An illustration of these compression problems is the simulation network model shown in Figure 7.12a ; this is identical with the problem shown in Figures 7.10 and 7.11 . It has been assumed in this case that the conditional activities can be performed only in one of two ways : either in the all-normal manner using one piece of equipment or in a fully crashed manner using two pieces of equipment . Consequently , all conditional activity compressions are " jump " compressions . In the utility data of Figure 7.12a are shown the effective cost slopes , ti'ic , together with  | the total cost of changing from the all-normal to the crashed method of performing each activity . In this example , three resource allocations , A , B , C , for the project have been considered . Allocation A has one piece of equipment I and one piece of equipment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of II ; and C has two pieces of each equipment . To conserve space here , the network compression calculations are demonstrated for allocation B only with equipments I and II ; calculations for the other two allocations are similar in principle . No other resources are introduced in this example , but the problem could , of course , be extended to include manpower , finance , etc. , if these are subject to management constraints . By using resource availability graphs for allocation B , the all-normal solution ( B1 ) is developed in Figure 7.12b . This is characterized by each conditional activity using one piece of equipment only ( although more are available ) to avoid needless cost . The project duration TPN of 32 days is identical with that of Figure 7.9 , because no resource limitation affects the critical time path . This all-normal ( cheapest direct cost ) solution for resource allocation B is assumed as datum for compression cost comparisons . In considering this solution ( B1 ) , it will be noticed that because only one piece of equipment II is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 ? 3 , and 3 ? 4 can not be speeded up any further and are therefore already crashed from a practical viewpoint . The critical path activities 0 ? 1 and 4 ? 5 only may consequently be considered for compression . Activity 4 ? 5 has a potential compression of 5 days and a cost slope of 60 units per day . No network limitations exist ( activity 3 ? 5 has a free float of S days ) , and therefore the project duration can be shortened 5 days . Activity 0 ? 1 , on the other hand , has a potential " jump " compression of 4 days , a total cost of 1S0 units , and an effective cost slope of 45 . However , the effect of this " jump " compression on the project duration is limited to 2 days ( as a trial calculation will show ) ; this is because the critical path switches to 0 ? 2 ? 3 ? 4 ? 5 , leaving activity 0 ? 1 with a 1-day FF . Hence the effective project cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ units per day ( 4 days decrease in activity 0 ? 1 at 45 , divided by 2 days decreased in project duration ) . Compression stages for this simulation network are therefore : 1 . Compress activity 4 ? 5 by 5 clays to full crash at a total cost of 300 units . This solution ( B2 ) is not illustrated , but is similar to 131 , except that activity 4 ? 5 now has a duration of 8 days . 2 . Compress activity 0 ? 1 by a " jump " of 4 ( lays , with an e fective reduction in project duration of 2 days , at a total cost of 180 units . ' 1'liis solution ( R3 ) is shown in Figure 7.13a.  | The switched critical path is apparent and results from the necessity for the start of activity 2 ? 3 to wait for satisfaction of event 2 , notwithstanding the fact that all equipment I is idle from day 4 to day 5 , as seen in resource graph I in Figure 7.13a . The new critical path in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It can be " jump " compressed by 3 days if both sets of equipment I are used ; however , a close study will show that , if this activity only is compressed , event 4 still occurs at day 17 and no reduction occurs in project duration . Thus despite the fact that event 3 can occur 1 day earlier ( at day 11 ) , activity 2 ? 4 can not begin until equipment I is free from activity 2 ? 3 at day 9 . Hence , unless activity 2 ? 4 is also " jump " compressed , the crashing of activity 2 ? 3 would be useless . Therefore : 3 . " Jump " compress activities 2 ? 3 and 2-4 for a 1-day reduction in project duration , at a total cost of 355 units . The result of this expensive compression is shown in Figure 7.13b . No further compression is possible . The derivation of the optimal project direct-cost curve for resource allocation B is seen plotted in Figure 7.14 as well as those for resource allocations A and C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same all-normal duration of 32 days , derived previously in Figure 7.9b . In  | other words , in this particular case , resource allocation A is the only one with a limitation preventing the usual CYiI all-normal solution ; its effect was previously seen in Figure 7.11 . This has a most important practical significance in that it shows that the project would be underequipped if resource allocation A were employed . In more general problems , families of curves would develop from the several possible restricted all-normal durations between the points corresponding to Al and BI in Figure 7.14 until the resource allocations exceed the minimum required for the usual CYM all-normal solution ; thereafter , another family of curves would radiate from the real allnormal duration as the various resource allocations imposed their limitations on the compressions of the simulation network model . This latter feature is demonstrated by the way in which the C curve departs from the B curve and offers cheaper optimal solutions ( in terms of direct cost ) at the expense ( indirect cost ) of bringing to the site the additional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of equipment II ) . The particular problem examined above is , of course , extremely simple . Uniform resource availability graphs were assumed , no activity shifting was required , and consequently no maneuvering was necessary within the resource utilization part of the graph ; also the " jump " compressions , although a proper practical consideration , reduced considerably the number of possible compression stages . It is felt , however , that from this indication of the nature of compression calculations for simulation networks , more complex problems can be undertaken by the reader . In conclusion , it is apparent from Figure 7.14 that , in effect , a threeparameter problem is developing , with the variables of project duration , number of pieces of equipment I , and number of pieces of equipment II . This means that a multidimensional cost surface could be evolved , for which more general optimizing compression calculations are feasible , thus enabling computation of the optimal resource allocation for a given project duration . This development leads immediately to the field of digital computers , which will be considered further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deriving the project direct-cost curves for various resource allocations and computing the actual indirect costs for providing each of these resource allocations on site , the problem arises of selecting which allocation to adopt for the project . In other words , which resource allocation will give the best overall economical solution ? The general method for determining this optimum solution , discussed in Section 5 . S , can be readily applied to projects involving resource limitations , as the following exercise will show .  | figure The project direct-cost data for the problem discussed in the preceding section are given in Figure 7.14 . Taking the cost of providing resource allocation A as datum , assume that allocations B and C require additional indirect costs of 200 and 400 money units , respectively ; assume also that the general indirect costs for the project are 50 money units per day . The project total cost curves can now be derived for each resource allocation and appears as shown in Figure 7.15 . The minimum project total cost is for a project duration of 27 days , with resource allocation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OVERVIEW The limited resource problem arises naturally in the ( ' 1 ' ; 11 process because of the positions adopted ( luring the planning and the manner in  | which the network model is developed . The emphasis on the separation of the planning and scheduling functions ensures an initial concentration on the development of the construction logic and the deferment of project resource considerations . Frequently , the deferment is total and tantamount to a blind acceptance of project resource requirements as dictated by the CPI schedule based on earliest starts . Often this attitude is discovered only the first time a schedule is generated , which leads to a conflict between the resources that can be made available to a project and those apparently needed as determined from the network model . The prime emphasis on the planning function in the CP1I process means that there is a strong tendency to formulate the construction logic independent of project resource requirements . This tendency , coupled with the initial assignment of resources ( implied or otherwise ) to each individual activity during the activity utility data definition stage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the construction plan and the network model . In fact , the CPM process has been described as being based on the assumption of infinite resource availability . The CPM process leads to two classical , limited resource problems , the resource leveling problem and the resource scheduling problem . The resource leveling problem adopts the network model and project duration based on the assumption of infinite resources and activity utility data , and searches for that schedule of the project activities which removes peak requirements of limited resources , or minimizes the number of certain specific limited resource types . The resulting resource requirements are then often adopted as being a natural attribute of the project , when , in fact , they are really a consequence of the specific construction plan and model developed independently of resource requirements . The resource scheduling problem commences with the network model and a project duration based on the assumption of infinite resources and activity utility data , and seeks that minimum time extension of the project duration so that a schedule of the activities becomes possible , yielding resource requirements that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintaining the construction logic . This approach does not question the resources originally assigned to the activities nor their durations . Currently , no formal mathematical model exists that considers the interaction between the various possible resource allocations per activity , the construction logic , and defined acceptable resource availabilities . , Vumy heuristic models exist based on arbitrary criteria , which obtain feasible solutions by considering a limited view of the problem area and  | taking advantage of a particular structuring of the limited resources problem . None consider tradeoffs between different resource allocations for an activity and its effect on project resource requirements , and all require a new start ( human initiated ) to provide feedback if unacceptable solutions result . Possibly the most successful attempts to date are those that incorporate repeated subjective input , in an on-line real time mode on computers , which permit reevaluation of activity status , construction logic , and acceptable resource availabilities . In this way the user can repeatedly make tradeoffs between planning and scheduling . Although optimal solutions are rarely obtained , at least the solutions so derived are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Recent research has been directed toward eliminating the rigidity implied in a full definition of the construction logic . That is , no attempt is initially made to specify completely the form of the network model , a necessary prerequisite for the CPiI process . Instead the construction logic is considered as being made up of three types of specifications : ( 1 ) the identification and ordering of collections of activities which must be contiguous , these collections forming rigid subgraphs which must be incorporated into the network model without distortion ; ( 2 ) the identification and relative ordering of collections of activities which are generally structured relative to each other , but which within limits can be further separated or closed in time , and can therefore be incorporated into the network model in an elastic fashion ; and ( 3 ) those activities that are independent and can be located almost anywhere in the project . The precise ordering is effected in such a way that either predetermined resource availabilities are not exceeded or resource requirements are kept to a minimum . These methods are heuristic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the advantage of combining the planning and scheduling stages without undue penalty in the formulation of the construction logic . In conclusion , it is doubtful if a formal mathematical method will ever appear because of the increasing number of sophisticated requirements that the method must meet . Even if it does eventuate , it is doubtful if it will be as computationally efficient as current heuristic methods . PROBLEMS 7.1 .

Every works operation , and the relevant constraints , must appear on the network , the development of which forces the planner to consult the various departments connected with the project . Hence all concerned acquire a fuller understanding of the problems , for it is in this preliminary planning phase that most of the vital decisions are made . Normally , several alternative methods for carrying out the project are possible ; these are each shown on separate networks , and associated calculations and schedules are made from approximate utility data . Although the final selection of a method for construction may occasionally depend on detailed calculations , a decision can usually be made from these preliminary networks and from approximate utility data . With large and complex projects , the preliminary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduce the size of the diagram until the best solution is determined ; for example , formwork , reinforcement , and concreting for a particular part of the works may be conveniently grouped into one activity . Once the best preliminary solution has been obtained , this condensed network diagram may be expanded ( if necessary ) to show each individual activity in more detail . The necessity for activities showing important materials deliveries and supply of vital drawings should not be overlooked . From the preliminary networks one or more may be chosen for complete examination . This requires compilation of complete utility data and a detailed network for the scheme . Isolated subnetworks of parts of the works , where alternatives still seem favorable , may be more closely examined . After deciding on a final scheme , a complete schedule for the  | project is prepared . Equipment , manpower , and other resources are then listed , and resource leveling requirements investigated . Considerable attention should be paid to the constraints , especially those imposed by manpower and special skill requirements . Often it is helpful to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Figure 3.9 ) to facilitate the proper understanding of constraints ; and it is usually easier to lay out the original network assuming unlimited resources and then to impose the constraints on it . Special attention must be given to events and activities along the critical and near-critical paths , and a check of activity relationship is worthwhile . Starting with the critical path , a reexamination of all constraints reveals whether any further speeding-up can be achieved , either by a rearrangement of sequences or of resources , still at the all-normal level . This examination of the critical path also reveals many especially critical events . The activities preceding each of these may then be reviewed to see if any alternatives exist which will achieve any of these events in less time . In any project there is no unique method of construction , and the best plan is obtained only after considering all possible alternatives . The selected method is then represented by a unique network diagram : the cheapest feasible ( all-normal ) solution . Following this procedure , crashed solutions may be examined according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the final network model emerges . Thus , before site operations begin at all , the selected optimum plan for the project has been carefully chosen and agreed on . This plan depends not on experience and judgment only , but on a mathematical and logical solution to the problems involved . 8.2 PREPARATION OF UTILITY DATA The proper presentation of activity utility data is of major practical importance . There are several types of utility curves , which may be broadly classified as follows : 1 . Smooth continuous concave curves , as in Figure 2.2a , which are ideal and theoretical ; these are never encountered in practice . 2 . Piecewise linear curves , such as in Figures 2.2b , 3.11 , and 6.1 , which are known as multistage utility curves and which approximate the ideal . The direct-cost/time relationship is continuous in that any duration between normal and full crash is feasible and valid . 3 . Single-stage straight-line linear approximations to the ideal or to multistage curves , when utility data are available only for normal and crashed durations ( as shown in Figures 6.14 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is validly continuous . 4.  | 5 . Noncontinuous discrete point curves of the type referred to for activity 1 ? 2 in Figure 6.4 . These may consist of two or more points , depending on the nature of the activity and the method of crashing . Here the direct-cost/time relationship is not continuous , and only specific durations are feasible and valid . 6 . Mixed concave-convex curves , as seen in Figure 6.9 , where the direct-cost/time relationship may be continuous , but where it is desirable to use only certain durations that are on the concave portions of the curve . The inefficient durations are thus avoided , as was done in Figure 3.14 for the combination of activities E and F. Here the utility data take the form of a discrete point curve . In practical planning it will rarely pay the estimator to prepare such detailed utility data that the curve will closely approach the ideal theoretical shape . At the most , piecewise linear approximations are adequate for continuous direct-cost/time relationships ; usually , single-stage ( that is , constant cost slope ) data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and considered is whether the utility curve is , in fact , continuous or whether ( as is often true ) discrete point utility data are essential ; this decision is fundamental if the network compressions are to yield feasible and valid solutions . Discrete point data are precise in their relationship to the actual direct costs and durations ; they are not an approximation , as with other types of practical utility curves . The preparation of the utility data required for the practical planning of construction projects may therefore be taken directly from the conventional cost estimates . In most project planning , all relevant alternative construction methods are examined as the direct-cost estimate for each activity is being prepared ; thus the utility data for these are immediately available when the network is being developed . The proper presentation of activity utility data therefore requires little additional effort by the busy estimator and entails merely the listing of all the separate activities with their appropriate durations and corresponding direct costs . Cost slopes ( when required ) may be computed by slide rule and added to the model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this procedure , several examples of CPM planning of actual construction works follow . ' ' To conserve space , the listing of activity sequence data and constraints has been omitted from these examples , and several steps in network development may be taken at one time . As an exercise , and to aid in a full appreciation of these examples , the reader may wish to list the activity and constraint data for himself from the networks . He may then try other alternative approaches to these projects .  | 8.3 EXAMPLE OF THREE-SPAN BRIDGE This example is presented first in order to demonstrate , in some detail , the development of a satisfactory feasible solution for executing a simple project on a one-shift basis . Various alternative proposals were investigated in sequence with the object of producing a " near all-normal " solution ; as will be seen , only a small amount of compression was used to derive the final network for this bridge . Network diagrams are drawn as sketches , for the busy planner has no time for finished drawings ; and essential information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the final network is attained , a proper drawing may then be made , showing all floats and utility data ; this is then the network model for the project . This project comprised the construction of a prestressed concrete girder bridge of three 100-ft spans , with a cast-in-situ deck , supported on two river piers and two abutments on level banks . The piers and abutments had precast concrete pile foundations , with pile caps below water level , each therefore requiring cofferdams . The river was reasonably stable , with no flood problem , and pier cofferdams could be withdrawn as soon as the lower half of the pier shaft was completed . A girder casting yard was necessary on the site , and the prestressed girders could easily be transported by trolleys running on rails across the flat banks and over the river on falsework . The concrete piles could either be cast on the site or purchased from a concrete products manufacturer in a neighboring town . Access was available to either bank , the existing road crossing the stream a short distance down-stream by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Local supply of labor was adequate , and a 40-hour working week was feasible . From direct costs in the works estimate , utility data for the project were as given in Table 8.1 . Indirect costs and overheads were estimated at $120 per working day . The contract time was 16 months ( 345 working days ) . First Network It was originally assumed that pile-driving would be a critical operation so that the structure could proceed rapidly ; it could therefore pay to purchase the piles for this reason alone . It was also assumed that , since access to both banks was easy , it would be advantageous to drive both sets of abutment piles consecutively while the falsework was being constructed ; and then to drive the piles in both piers . In this way , no floating plant was required , and sufficient falsework could be erected for access to the piers by the time the two abutments had been driven .  | figure  | The falsework was of timber , on timber piles , constructed entirely by mobile crane ( which could drive the timber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cofferdam material , one set of pier formwork , and one set of abutment forms were considered adequate . One pile-driving rig could be provided for the concrete piles , and the cofferdam installations and removals could be handled by the mobile crane and doubleacting hammer . Figure 8.1 shows the preliminary network prepared on the above assumptions if piles were cast on the site . For convenience , activities J2 and K1 were grouped , because they had the same duration and were concurrent ; likewise J3 and K2 ( a practical step to keep the network as small as possible ) . The calculated minimum project duration was 332 days . The initial assumption that it would be advantageous to drive both sets of abutment piles before the piers ( to gain time for falsework construction ) was not substantiated ; this is obvious from the total float available for activities F1 ? F2 ? F3 at event 20 . This initial network therefore was useful in presenting a picture of the job , but was certainly capable of improvement . Second Network The effect of driving the piles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pier 1 , pier 2 , abutment B was the next obvious step ; piles were still to be cast on the site ( cheaper than purchasing ) . The result is seen in Figure 8.2 : a minimum project duration of 317 days . This proposal not only saved 15 days , but still provided considerable float in pile casting and falsework construction at no extra direct cost . Analysis of plant scheduling showed that the mobile crane still had sufficient time to carry out falsework and cofferdam operations in the required order . Third Network Retaining the sequence of pile-driving adopted in the second network , the effect of purchasing the piles was investigated next ; activities Cl to C4 were thus eliminated , and both cost and time savings were obtained in a smaller casting yard . The result is shown in Figure 8.3 : the minimum project duration was reduced to 295 days . In addition , it was found that , with the time now available , the pile-driving rig could cope with both the concrete piling and the cofferdam work . The mobile crane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ released from the job . Compared with the second network plan , this scheme cost $4000 extra  | for the piles , but saved $800 in crane charges and $1200 in casting-yard construction ( activity B ) , a net extra cost of $2000 . The indirect cost saving of 22 days at $120 was $2640 , so this scheme just managed to pay off . On this network , the critical path followed the pile-driving operations ; this led to the suggestion that the pile rig crew should work a 9-hour day to avoid probable delays in the project . Fourth Network The utility data for a 45-hour week for activities D and E are given in Table 8.1-the piles were still to be purchased . Figure 8.4 shows the network for this proposal : the project duration was now 285 days . With an increased direct cost of $660 for overtime plus the additional net $2000 from the third network total extra direct cost was 82660 , compared with the second network ; the indirect cost saving of 32 days at 8120 = 83840 therefore made this proposal more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critical path now lay through the casting yard ( where further compression was not feasible ) , and the pile-driving operations had a float of 8 days throughout . From a practical viewpoint this was a more preferable critical path , because precasting operations are more easily controlled than other site work ; and furthermore , pile-driving procedures are such that some float is practically essential . This network presented a satisfactory plan for a " near-normal " solution and was therefore adopted for bidding purposes . The total cost of the works , compared with the original proposal ( first network ) was : figure Conclusion Although the reduction in cost from the first to the fourth proposal was barely $3000 in this case , the use of CPlt-I enabled a superior project plan to be evolved , from a practical viewpoint , with greater certainty of the relationship between all the operations of the job . Further revision of this project plan , during construction of the bridge , is discussed in Chapter 9 . The complete CP1VI analysis , from the conclusion of the direct-cost estimate to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data ) , took one estimator just over a day . Before the end of the second day , the scheduling and a first draft of the bar-graph construction  | program had been completed . ' The use of CPM therefore gave an assured works cost reduction of $2980 , and a sound plan for doing the job , at the expense of 2 days ' extra work by the estimator. 8.4 EXAMPLE OF ROCK-FILL DAM Many construction works require careful assessment of site hazards . The effects of such hazards , and the constraints which they produce on relevant activities , may be shown on network diagrams by means of artificial " hazard activities . " This technique is particularly applicable to the constraints induced by river behavior in dam construction works , as the following example of a rock-fill dam project illustrates . This rock-fill dam , approximately 1000 ft long and 175 ft high , involved the winning , placing , and sluicing of 500,000 cu yd of rock in the main bank , with 35,000 cu yd of packed rock on the upstream face , supporting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The spillway , located at one end of the dam , required 18,000 cu yd of concrete and an additional 1250 cu yd would be needed for outlet works , and so on . A good quarry site was available at an average haul of half a mile , and it was estimated that about 85% of quarry rock would be suitable for use . The river had a reasonably regular behavior , with a definite flood season . It was specified that bank construction begin at the end of a flood season and that the rock-fill be completed to RL 1400 before the next floods ; placing of rock-fill could then continue to RL 1475 , leaving a suitable flood gap , and thereafter the embankment could be completed to final level ( RL 1500 ) . River diversion was to be handled in four stages : ( 1 ) through a temporary diversion culvert under the dam , which would ultimately be part of the outlet works ( this could carry normal river flow and minor freshes ) ; ( 2 ) after construction of the inlet tower and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( with flood gap ) , the stream could be taken into a temporary opening in the base of the inlet tower and then through the culvert ; ( 3 ) on completion of the main bank and a reasonable proportion of the face slabs , the temporary opening in the inlet tower could be plugged and the reservoir permitted to fill ; ( 4 ) the outlet pipeline from the inlet tower to the downstream valve house would be installed in the culvert . Because construction labor was in short supply , it was decided to attract workmen to the site by providing a long working week and hence ' The reader may care to carry out the scheduling and prepare the construction program showing relevant float times as an exercise .  | higher wages . The utility data , based on a working week of six 9-hour days ( original network ) , is shown in Table 8.2 ; also shown is a revision , based on two 8-hour shifts on excavation and rock-fill , and one 9-hour shift on other work , 6 days per week , used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ included in activity A in each case . Indirect costs for the project amounted to $500 per working day . The construction time allowed was 20 months . Specified constraints , additional to those already stated , were : ( 1 ) figure  | activity F must be completed before E2 begins ; ( 2 ) G must follow E3 , and H must follow B3 ; and J2 can not begin until E2 is finished . The flood season lasted for 6 months with a month 's uncertainty as to starting and finishing dates . It was decided to assume a flood period of 31 weeks . Adopting a 6-day week for the project ( 312 working days per annum ) , it was assumed for estimating purposes that the flood season would cover 190 working days and the clear season 120 . By the use of " hazard activities , " the influence of floods can be shown in the network diagram as constraints on the activities affected by flood conditions . First Network : 54-hour week The specified starting date for the bank construction controlled the project starting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ construction time permitted was 520 working days . In Figure 8.5a is seen the network diagram developed from the original utility data . The constraints due to flood hazards are indicated along the top , together with the hazard activity dummies and notes on the diagram ; these affected all work except activities A , B1 , B4 , D , E2 , E3 , G , J1 , J4 , J5 , K2 , and L ( H could be done if the flood were not severe ) . For clarity in following separate chains of activities , the start of the project has been divided into three separate events , numbered 0 , 1 , and 2 ; these are connected by dummies to retain the logic . The project duration was 505 days by this scheme , which was considered very tight for works of this type . Furthermore , it can be seen that because of the flood constraints , nearly every path in the network is critical ; and , in addition , the network still contains flood dangers , notably at events 9 , 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore essential , and was computed ( on the basis of worst possible damage , plus delays and penalties ) at $96,000 . The works cost estimated with this original network thus became figure Even with this contingency , this scheme did not offer a very attractive proposition for the construction of the works . Revised Network : Partial Shift-work It was obvious that a shorter project duration had to be achieved and that the flood hazards should , if possible , be removed . After some trial networks , it appeared that two 8-hour shifts on excavation and  | rock-fill and one 9-hour shift on other operations would be satisfactory . The utility data were revised , as seen in Table 8.2 ; after crashing the later 75% of activity J2 to a two-shift operation , the revised network appeared as in Figure 8.5b Activity K1 was postponed until after the flood season , to be done immediately prior to K2 , thus providing continuity for a metal-work crew ; and since the hazard activity dummies are now real dummies , the network is logically tied together . Event 13 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flood season ; if the floods finished early , the project time could be reduced . However , for safety , advantage was not taken of this , and a project duration of 453 days was adopted . The critical paths on this revised network diagram were 1 ? 3 ? 6 ? 11 ? 13 ? 16 ? 22 ? 23 , with 1 ? 5 ? 7 ? 9 for the first clear season . Project duration was well within the allowed time , and no flood contingency was required ; indeed , a saving of 10 days ' indirect cost ( $5000 ) could be made in all probability if the flood season ended on its predicted time ( the flood hazard period of 190 days included for probable lateness ) . There was a very reasonable float on the two-shift rock-fill operations , and a possibility of slackening off to single shift toward the end of embankment construction ; subsequent resource leveling proved that this could be done . In other words , this revised proposal included a small but sufficient hidden contingency . The works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure Final Network : Crash Finish Because of the necessity to crash the last 75% of activity J2 to a two-shift operation to attain the solution shown in the revised network ( Figure 8.5b ) , the next obvious step was investigating optimal compression beyond event 13 . Figure 8.6a shows this portion of the network as in Figure 8.5b , but with the necessary compression utility data added . No crashing of the critical path was possible before event 13 because of its control by the flood season ; nor was it considered advisable to compress the final activity L ( 22 ? 23 ) . Therefore the two activities 11 ? 13 and 22 ? 23 are marked with a cross ( X ) to indicate that they are not available for compression . Furthermore , if activity 13 ? 16 ( the last 75% of J2 ) was to be crashed from its existing two-shift to a three-shift operation , it would be necessary to complete event 17 before event 13 to avoid a clash in concrete requirements between activity J4 and the  | fully crashed J2 ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have to be introduced . The first full compression was of activity 16 ? 22 ( B4 ) ? the cheapest cost slope available which immediately introduced a new critical path . Subsequent compressions of activities 16 ? 18 ( J5 ) by 6 days and 11 ? 17 ( J4 ) by 20 days ? with introduction of a new dummy ? enabled a full compression of activity 13 ? 16 , together with full compression of 15 ? 16 ( B3 ) followed by partial compression of activity 13 ? 14 ( B2 ) . These compressions resulted in two looped critical paths in the final network , as seen in Figure 8.6b and reduced the project duration by 37 days to a total of 416 days . ' figure Additional shift supervision for 81 days at $25 2,025 Hence the total extra direct cost of this crashing = $8,135 The reduction in indirect costs for 37 days at a rate of $500 per day was $18,500 , giving a net saving for the crash finish of $10,365 and a works cost estimate for the final network of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project an estimate had been taken out by the contractor in the conventional manner , on the basis of the 54-hour week . The conventional bar chart construction program showed that the timing was tight for flood periods and also for the completion date so that a conventional contingency would have to be added . On the erroneous but normal assumption that a faster program would not result in overall decreased cost , the conventional ' The reader should formulate the logic and carry out the network compression calculations as an exercise . Obviously , this final network model requires redrafting with the events renumbered to accommodate the new constraint introduced as dummy 1IA-13 ; the reader may wish to do this , too , and then perhaps to investigate this project for financial resource planning after mastering Section 10.2.  | estimate for bidding purposes was composed as follows : figure The critical path network analysis used the same direct and indirect costs to obtain its utility data and commenced with the 54-hour-week proposal as a preliminary examination of the problems of the project ; this immediately disclosed the flood risks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 5% arbitrary contingency sum . The subsequent critical path planning proved not only that the flood risk could be removed but that the second flood season could be avoided , at the same time gaining considerable reductions in cost , a less rushed move-in time , and a much more satisfactory sequence of operations ; even the crash finish pulled over $10,000 off the cost . The application of critical path methods to this project at the bidding stage resulted in a reduction of the original conventional bid estimate by almost $96,000 and gave the contractor a superior construction plan for the execution of the works . It required a little over 2 days work by the CP1I planner and was based entirely on the contractor 's own estimates of cost rates and productivity . It should be added , before leaving this example , that when major hazards exist on a construction site , a series of network diagrams may be drawn up ( during the preliminary planning ) to determine the advantages of one starting date in comparison with another . This will often provide additional insight into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the relative risks involved in the various alternatives investigated . On certain occasions it may prove economical overall to delay the start of a project quite considerably , and then to adopt a crash program , in order to finish the job within the permitted time . Critical path analysis is the only logical way to investigate this aspect of construction planning . Furthermore , it can be employed to assess and compare the costs of risks which have to be tolerated . 8.5 EXAMPLE OF SEWER MAIN This trunk sewer extension , a little over a mile long , was laid partly in trench ( 3600 lin.ft ) and partly in tunnel ( 1800 lin.ft ) . The tunnel section presented no unusual difficulty , but sections of the trench passed  | through very bad ground , requiring considerable support . Access to the tunnel section was by several manhole shafts forming part of the works . The specific problem here , after determining the construction method , was obtaining the optimum solution for the cheapest overall cost . Alternative Solutions There were only three feasible solutions : the all-normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least-time ( working as fast as possible from a practical viewpoint ) , and a partially crashed solution . The utility data for the various activities at different shifts are given in Table 8.3 and the relevant networks in Figure 8.7 . For convenience some concurrent activities are grouped in the diagrams . Following activities B and C , there are artificial activities introduced to cover waiting periods ; these are labeled " wait " and represent an assessed delay , after finishing excavation , to permit the completion of other activities . figure  | The all-normal single-shift solution required 353 days and involved fluctuations in labor requirements . The practical least-time solution has a number of critical paths and could not economically be crashed further , except to work shifts on activities A and M , which was not considered feasible ; the project duration was 145 days ( see Figure 8.7c ) . The optimum solution must lip between these two . Examination of the network in Figure 8.7a showed if activity C were crashed that activity B must also be crashed for a satisfactory network ;  | Figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main . ( c ) Practical least-time solution : Tno = 145 days . this was then developed as the first-crash solution and is seen at ( b ) . After a few other trials , it proved to be the only practicable alternative ; its duration was 203 days . Optimum Solution The time-cost curves were plotted in Figure 8.8 , where it is clear that network ( b ) is the most economical method . The most interesting feature of this analysis was that , with the purpose of finishing the job as fast as possible , the practical least-time method of working would have been selected by the contractor , except for CPM ; had he done so , he would have needlessly cost himself an additional $4570 . It took barely a halfday 's work with CPM to obtain the optimum solution . The scheduling and financial budget for this project are developed later in Figures 10.1 and 10.2.  | Every construction job will normally lose some time because of snow or rain . This should be recognized in preparing the network model for a project so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more realistic . Determination of inclement weather cost allowances is made by the estimator when computing the labor rates for the direct-cost estimate . These allowances are then included in the manhour rates as part of the labor on-cost ; for a realistic network diagram these weather allowances should be translated into time when considering the duration of each activity . For example , if 1 day per week is expected to be lost because of inclement weather , then those activities affected by these conditions should have their theoretical durations increased by about 20% . Activities that may proceed irrespective of the weather do not require such adjusted durations . By notation on the network , it can be made clear to the field staff which of the activity durations include this allowance for lost time : one method , for instance , is to show duration as " 10 (  --  2 ) " to indicate that the computed no-delay duration of  | 10 days has , in addition , an allowance of 2 days for expected delays ; this activity is then assumed to require 12 days duration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occur at weekends and public holidays . Network durations show only working days and for programming , therefore , these must be converted to calendar dates . This , however , requires no adjustment on the diagram , but rather an attached tabulation showing the actual dates corresponding to specific days on the network timing . Depending on the hours to be worked on the project , weekends and public holidays may be counted as working days or not , as appropriate . If the project is delayed during construction , a new date tabulation is easily prepared . This is much more preferable than trying to show dates on the network diagram itself . In preparing date tabulations , and indeed in the compilation of network diagrams , it must be remembered that some activities and constraints are specified by calendar dates and not by working days ; simple examples are concrete curing periods and formwork stripping times ; these lose no time through weekends , public holidays , or inclement weather . For a simpler explanation and for clarity in presenting the preceding networks and examples , no allowances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be realistic in practice ) , every network model and every project schedule should provide for predictable lost time that may be regarded as normal , as well as including as constraints all the essential time delays pertinent to the job . This has been done in Figure 8.9 , using one of the many conventions adopted for indicating lost time allowances ; in this connection , the authors recommend the following . Essential time delays should be shown as artificial activities , having time but no cost . If , for instance , it is specified that the formwork of a concrete beam can not be removed for a week after casting , then the stripping of this beam must be removed from the concreting by an artificial activity having a duration of 5 for a 5-day working week ( or 6 for a 6-day working week ) , as shown with activities 5 ? 6 and 10 ? 11 in Figure 8.9 . Similarly , if a 2-week curing period is specified before any loading may be placed on a member , an artificial ( delay ) activity is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Figure 8.9 with activity 5 ? 7 ( at the same time incorporating the shorter delay of 5 days , for stripping formwork , as activity 5 ? 6 ) . Expected time delays , which may not occur , are shown as increases to the normal or crashed durations of an activity , and should be in parentheses to indicate that they are not factual . Expected time delays include the normal lost times which generally occur , and are predictable , but not precisely computable ? such as inclement weather ; the method  | of showing these is seen in Figure 8.9 for activities 3 ? 8 , 8 ? 13 , 4 ? 9 , 5 ? 10 , and so on . Thus in a network there are two ways of providing for lost time that is expected to occur on the site . If the delay is specific or if it is assessed as essential for any valid reason , it is represented as an artificial activity within a finite duration and zero cost ( as was done with the " wait " periods in Figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is expected to occur , but may not , then it is shown as an addition to the durations of the activities which it will affect ( as was done with activity 11 ? 13 in Figure 8.5b and Figure 8.6 ) . The addition , however , is written separately in brackets so that the field staff may differentiate between an efficient speeding-up of an activity and a gain in time because a probable delay did not occur . Thus , both in planning and in project control , the network diagram presents a logical and practicable delineation of the project , resulting in a plan that is reasonably capable of achievement on the site . 8.7 PLANNING FOR ANNUAL WORKS PROGRAMS Many organizations carry out construction and maintenance works with their own day-labor forces and equipment , operating on an annual financial budget ; in addition , some of them may apportion part of their work on contract . When possible , they endeavor to provide regular employment for their labor and plant forces ( which preferably should remain fairly steady ) so as to carry out efficiently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annual budget . Examples of these organizations include public utility authorities , local government councils , certain government departments , and some large industrial undertakings . All of them will derive considerable benefit from using CP1V1 in planning their annual works programs . The planning procedure is based on the principles already discussed . First , detailed direct-cost estimates are prepared for all the works awaiting attention in the following year and in the subsequent near future ; the list of works should be then arranged in order of preference for construction . Usually the list is larger than can be accomplished with available funds , so it is useful to know at least the more urgent works . Where jobs are of sufficient magnitude , they may be individually submitted to network analysis to determine their durations and costs . Whether or not this is done , it is essential that accurate predictions of time and cost are made for every item on the list of works . Second , the manpower demand and a plant schedule are derived for each item ; where necessary for the major jobs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requirements .  | The individual works are then coordinated into a combined network diagram , accommodating first the urgent and important works , adjustments being made as expedient to ensure continuity of labor and plant utilization . The floats are then calculated and recorded ; if desired , a CYM bar chart may be drawn up to visualize the problem at this stage . During analysis of the individual job networks , and in the combined network diagram , every endeavor should be made to retain all-normal operation . If some activities must be crashed , the additional costs must be derived and added to the utility data , for the annual budget is usually not very flexible . At the conclusion of this stage , the major works pro-  | gram and costs are established , manpower and plant schedules for the combined operations are computed , and the available floats and gaps tabulated . The minor jobs are then fitted into the gaps or into the available floats , thus completing the year 's program within the budget . As a simple example of this method of planning for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose principal equipment comprises two motor graders , one bulldozer , a front-end loader , and a small portable concreting plant . With these it carries out general maintenance and improvement works within its area , all major construction ( and works beyond its capacity ) being let out on contract . The council owns and operates service vehicles only , general haulage jobs being done by hired trucks when required . The annual funds available for direct-cost works expenditure amount to $245,000 . Table 8.4 shows  | the works awaiting attention , in the preferred order of precedence , together with the utility data pertaining to each . It is impossible to accomplish this program completely since it exceeds available funds . The problem is to find the optimum works schedule that takes full advantage of resources , bearing in mind that the rainy season ( of 2 months duration ) occurs from weeks 37 to 46 . After computing the utility data from the detailed cost estimates and small networks for individual jobs , the combined network diagram for the year was begun with items A , B @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , H , and I ( the principal essential works ) ; these were rearranged as required until a reasonable sequence appeared , and then the other works were fitted into relevant spaces . After further rearrangement , the final network looked like Figure 8.10 . Examination of this diagram shows that the specified items were programmed to avoid the rainy season , that there are reasonable allowances for normal lost time , as well as a general float of one week , and that the equipment is kept reasonably well occupied . The total expenditure amounts to $241,800 , which is very satisfactory in comparison with the annual funds available , allowing for the one week float . ( Some money must be available to cover expenditure for this week 's work if this float is not consumed . ) There is , of course , no critical path in this network , because of the deliberate provision of float . The EFT and LFT of events 20 , 21 , 22 , and 23 demonstrate this point . Activity J ( 23 ? 24 ) may start either at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time ; its timing is not vital , because it is planned to continue into the next financial year . Activity M can begin at week 51 if the one-week float is still available then . In a large organization , there may have to be considerable activity shifting within the proposed program period to accommodate all the work in a smooth-flowing sequence and within the total allowable expenditure while still retaining a reasonably fixed labor force and avoiding idle plant time . Normal lost times must be provided for and some margin of float preserved for unforeseen delays . Such planning will ensure that the Council members , or members of the governing Board , fully understand why certain works are scheduled at their specific times and why they can not be done economically at other times . It is obvious that adequate project control must be exercised ( luring execution of the program and that revisions may have to be made for unforeseen conditions ; hence the necessity to preserve some float for possible activity adjustment during the year and some funds for the resulting cost variations . Activity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project control follow in the next chapter .  | 8.8 PLANNING FOR REPETITIVE OPERATIONS Frequently , in construction work a series of activities will recur in a specific order , either continuously or from time to time . A simple example is the construction of a high , reinforced concrete retaining wall in which the sequence of activities between events 10 and 15 in Figure 8.11 will be repeated for every lift of concrete in the wall . Obviously , with such a series , the crew size and duration for each activity will be arranged to provide , as far as possible , continuity of work between events 10 and 15 ; or , alternatively , other work on the project will be planned to enable the activities between events 10 and 15 to be done by appropriate crews without loss of time . In the simple case of Figure 8.11 , if the various operations were all carried out by one crew , this group of activities could be combined conveniently into a single activity 10-15 , comprising the six detailed tasks involved from the finish of placing concrete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lift y . In the network diagram of the project this single activity would then have a single appropriate duration and would be repeated for each lift of the wall . If , however , the various tasks are carried out by different crews , they can not be combined into a single activity , because it is not then possible to show the individual durations and tasks affecting the work of each crew . In practice , there are many cases of repetitive operations in which the series of activities can not be logically combined . In these cases the repeating subnetwork must be shown each time it occurs , and some care will be necessary to ensure that the correct network logic of interdependency of activities is maintained ; this can only be achieved by the judicious use of dummies . A typical example is seen in Figure 8.12 in which details of successive lifts of the concrete retaining wall are shown employing three separate crews : one for concrete placing , another for preparing the construction joint and installing the reinforcement , and a third for the formwork @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work on other parts of the project .  | A similar but more complex situation occurs in the construction of multistory buildings where the finishing trades are scheduled to follow one another in a predetermined order from floor to floor . Figure 8.13 demonstrates in arrow notation the necessity for dummies to preserve the logic ; for instance , on any floor the carpenter and plumber can not start until the bricklayer has finished , and yet they are not dependent on one another ? and the plasterer can not begin until the carpenter and plumber are both finished ; however , the finish carpenter ( joiner ) and electrician , who follow the plasterer , are dependent on one another and must work each floor together , after which the painter can follow . Obviously , the double events are required to differentiate between the end of work by a trade on one floor and the start of the same trade on the next floor ; if only one node were used , the logic of the network would be incorrect , since it would show , for example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fourth , plumbing on the fifth , and so on . Figure 8.14 models the same situation in circle notation and illustrates the general advantage a precedence diagram has over arrow notation in quickly representing complex logical situations . It is interesting to note the subnetworks in both representations for a typical floor ( say the third ) . Figure 8.15 shows these subnetworks in arrow and circle notation side by side . It is possible to convert one network into the other by making simple changes in the modeling of the activities . If this is done , it will be seen that the logic for both networks is , in fact , identical . PROBLEMS 8.1 . Given the following network , draw the diagrams for ( a ) the earliest start schedule and ( b ) the latest start schedule .  | 8.2 . It is desired to purchase a new crane .

The separate crews for each construction operation are to be organized to progress at the rate of 4 miles per week , the pipeline being 40 miles long . Draw sufficient network diagram for this project to indicate logically the con , struction planning and determine the minimum project duration required in the field . ( Construct the network diagram roughly to scale , with each horizontal chain representing the progress of one construction operation , such as survey and delivery. ) 8.4 . A new road deviation with concrete pavement , shown below in longitudinal section , is 11,600 ft long .

A major bridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 7 steel truss spans in the main channel , and 15 steel approach spans on the right bank . The substructure consists of concrete piers and abutments . On the left bank the abutment and 5 piers are on dry land and also the abutment and 8 piers on the right bank . All piers and abutments are supported on precast concrete piles to be cast on the site and not to be driven until they are at least 28 days old . It is planned that the casting yard will manufacture piles at a rate of one pier or abutment every 12 weeks . On dry land pile driving is estimated to require 2 weeks per pier or abutment ; on the river , 3 weeks . Construction of the pile caps at each land pier will take 2 weeks , and at each river pier 3 weeks ; each abutment or pier shaft above the pile caps can be built in 22 weeks at any location , and must cure for 2 weeks before steel is erected on it . Assembly and erection of approach span steelwork over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water 2 weeks ; assembly and erection of truss steelwork will require 3 weeks per span . The concrete deck slabs in each span will require 2 weeks to form and cast in place at each location and will be constructed alternatively from each end of the bridge to the center , thus averaging 1 week per span . A period of 3 months should be allowed to move in , procure materials , and set up equipment . Clean up and move out will take 41 weeks . It is planned to use two pile-driving crews , two pier construction crews , two steelwork crews , and one concrete deck crew with two sets of forms . Prepare a network diagram for this project , showing the broad scheduling requirements .  | Project Control with Critical Path Methods 9.1 NECESSITY FOR PROJECT CONTROL The construction industry has special features that are not encountered in other industries . First , there is a wide range of operations and processes , from excavation to dam construction , from pile-driving to multistory buildings , from tunneling to bridge erection , from marine work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ construction methods , equipment , and labor skills . Second , the work sites are always temporary and often remote ; full-scale production on any one site may last only a few months or at best a few years . Third , the local site management rarely has full control of policy and finance and can never be selfsufficient . Finally , construction personnel are divided into two groups , the more-or-less permanent executives and the transitory operatives . Thus the field organization must be adaptable to the varied conditions from project to project , and must be flexible enough to control adequately the works being executed under a multiplicity of site conditions . Furthermore , the planning and estimating of construction works must take into account these characteristics . Construction projects are therefore carefully planned and estimated so that they may be successfully completed with regard to quality , time , and cost . Planning helps in selecting the most economical construction method , determining the plant , meeting manpower and financial requireinents , proper ordering and delivery of materials , establishing the necessary supervisory staff , engaging competent subcontractors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the anticipated cost . No paper plan , however , will work continually in practice , even if it is perfect theoretically . Unforeseen delays , unpredictable constraints , and unknown factors will all affect the smooth operation , as depicted on the 215  | network or shown on a bar chart program . Hence it is essential that management is kept continually and accurately informed of the progress of the works and that precise predictions are made of the effect of each site occurrence on the available resources and future operations . To review the current procedures and forecast the future requirements of the job , so that the works may be successfully completed , is the primary purpose of project control . To work effectively , there must be some means of determining rapidly sound solutions to the day-to-day problems , so that the essential requirements for remedial measures may be promptly initiated . To do this , it may be advisable to reestimate the cost of the uncompleted portion of the works and to revise the utility data in the light of current costs of operations ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new ones ; it may indeed , be essential to revise the entire remainder of the program in order to finish the job within the specified time at the least possible cost . By employing critical path methods trouble can be foreseen in sufficient time to determine the required logical revisions for any new situations . The former method , that of speeding up everything on the job running behind schedule , has no place whatever in the office of the manager who has CPM at his elbow . The more accurate and logical the planning , the easier it will be for the work to be performed in accordance with the program . Highly detailed planning , however , takes time and costs money . Consequently , project planning at the bidding stage may not proceed far enough to provide all the necessary particulars for project control . For this reason , it is essential that , before beginning operations on the site , the project schedule ( and its accompanying networks and charts ) be reviewed for special details . Although this reviewing procedure is actually the final phase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step toward the actual site control of the project and should be done with considerable care . 9.2 REVIEWING THE SCHEDULE AND NETWORKS With the main network diagram completed and doublechecked for inaccuracies or omissions , and with subsidiary networks showing more intricate details of parts of the project worthy of more personal attention , the estimator has a master plan for the scheduling of labor , materials , and plant . Very often in construction planning , however , the network ( and its accompanying schedule ) may be left at the development stage reached in the examples given in Chapter 8 , for this is often adequate for bidding purposes : a range of starting and finishing dates for each ac-  | tivity has been determined and a CPM bar chart ( as in Figure 2.5 ) or time-scaled network ( Figure 3.9b ) drawn up . When a contract is obtained , however , the fullest details are required . It then becomes necessary to know the optimum dates for the actual start of each operation , having in mind the smooth flow of all the required resources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but for noncritical activities these may now be reviewed , leaving some float available for unpredictable delays . Originally , the time estimates for all activities in the project were based on obtaining the optimum duration for minimum total cost . Within this limited duration , noncritical activities can be shifted across the program within their available float ; or it may be more practical to use smaller crews ( taking a longer time ) at no change ? or at a saving ? in cost , thus helping to smooth out labor and equipment requirements . Alternatively , two activities using the same plant or labor skills , originally planned for simultaneous performance , may now be made consecutive , if one or both of them have enough float . In short , resource leveling is carried out so that noncritical activity durations and starting dates are so assigned that they smooth out avoidable labor , equipment , and budget fluctuations . The procedure for the leveling of labor and equipment was discussed in Chapter 7 and that for financial planning occurs in Chapter 10 . In seeking these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the float on noncritical chains is not completely consumed ; otherwise no means for maneuver will remain during construction . The changes resulting in the schedule from the above review will , of course , necessitate changes in the timing on the network diagram itself . Obviously it is preferable for the final network model for the project and the final schedules to be fully developed in the office , if possible at the bidding stage . Even if done later , it is nevertheless essential that all activity starting dates should be determined for the field staff before beginning work on the site . The tedious detailed scheduling in the field is thus avoided , the field staff can concentrate their efforts toward the construction operations from the start , and the construction manager is presented at the outset with a feasible plan . 9.3 REGULAR PROJECT REVIEWING DURING CONSTRUCTION Basically , project control with CPI is the need for regular periodic reviews of the work completed to date , together with revisions of the network model as necessity demands . This technique has been compared to that for guided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all  | known corrections before firing the shot ; with CPI the trajectory may be continually changed , so that the project is consistently steered to its completion date at least overall cost . The general procedure is to revise the project network periodically , replacing the original time predictions with actual facts as time elapses . Whenever the activity durations are revised , the network is analyzed to determine whether the critical path and the project duration have been affected . If the job is found to be running behind time , the network may be amended and the appropriate future activities crashed to restore the position . Such crashing may take the form of overtime work , introduction of additional plant and/or labor , resort to shift work , etc . The actual cost of these remedial measures may be forecast and alternative proposals compared with one another in order to determine the optimum overall solution . Sometimes it may even prove economical to accept the delayed completion date . Delayed noncritical activities may be permitted to consume their available float without affecting project duration . If the delay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critical path will change and the uncompleted portion of the network must be reanalyzed . Sometimes it will be advantageous to manipulate deliberately the critical path or to change the sequence of activities when one is faced with site delays and unforeseen problems . Whatever one does , the consequences may be quickly analyzed and costed , which enables a quick comparison with other proposals and with the original estimate . After the remedial measures have been decided , the network , with its schedules and bar charts , are appropriately revised , and thus a new plan is available for the uncompleted portion of the project . In this way the construction plan may be " updated " whenever necessary . The usual causes of time delay on construction works include : 1 . Incorrect estimates of activity durations. 2 . Unforeseen weather conditions or site hazards . 3 . Unpredictable delays in delivery of materials . 4 . Strikes or other labor troubles . 5 . Unexpected site conditions . 6 . Extras or deductions in works quantities . The criterion for network revision is the magnitude of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say a few days only ) which can be tolerated , the tabulation of calendar dates may be revised and a note made on the network diagram . Extensive delays , the necessity to change the sequence of events , or the introduction of new activities to cope with  | ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) will demand full revision of the network model in order to depict properly the new plan . Regular reviewing of site operations may be made at any appropriate time . Usually weekly or two-weekly periods will suffice ; but on large , fast-moving jobs ( working on a three-shift basis ) daily review of the major operations is warranted . Alternatively , reviewing may depend on the occurrence of specific control events. - The system is quite flexible and may be suited to the desire of the construction manager . Project reviewing may be confined to examining critical and near-critical activities or it may consider the status of the entire works . Similarly , network revision may cover the whole diagram or may be confined to a particular portion . The degree of uncertainty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completion , and the troubles encountered are all factors influencing the frequency of periodic project reviewing . It would appear at first sight that it is only necessary to save time on critical activities in order to bring a late project back on schedule . In the periodic reviews of works progress , therefore , there is a tendency to concentrate on activities lying on the critical path . If this is carried too far , however , noncritical activities may slip behind time to such an extent that they become critical . The two methods of guarding against this are either to review all activities in full or to use the current rate of works expenditure as a warning . The first method may necessitate a considerable amount of unprofitable review work , unless there has been serious slippage of the noncritical activities ; it is nevertheless the only positive way to determine the matter . In the second method , the current rate of expenditure is compared with the scheduled works expenditure rate . If the critical activities are on time or ahead of schedule , but the expenditure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the noncritical activities are slipping ; on the other hand , under similar circumstances , if expenditure is in accord with or ahead of schedule , no serious slippage has occurred unless the critical path timing has been maintained by the use of resources taken from the noncritical activities ( and this latter will be apparent from the costing control ? see Chapter 10 ) . With a view to avoiding unnecessary paper work , and yet ensuring that any slippage of noncritical activities is readily detected , the simplest practical way on a large project is to review critical and near-critical activities at regularly short intervals as well as the works expenditure rate . When the expenditure rate indicates the possibility of a slippage , and in any case at longer regular periods ( or at the occurrence of selected control events ) , a complete activity review is undertaken . If the project is equipped for cost control with CPAI ( see Chapter 10 ) , the periodic review of the entire works may well coincide with ( say ) the monthly cost  | periods , which in turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finally , if it is found at any time that the critical activities are behind time , or barely on schedule , while at the same time the works expenditure is higher than expected , then either critical items are being neglected in favor of noncritical activities or the cost of meeting critical dates was underestimated ; the detailed costing of each activity will disclose the actual cause . 9.4 REVISING THE NETWORK DURING CONSTRUCTION Information for the periodic reviewing of site operations is collected in activity status reports ; the simplest form is illustrated in Figure 9.1 . Each report should cover every relevant activity in progress , due to start or due to finish , during the review period . This information is then transferred to the network diagram or model , which becomes , in fact , a permanent record of works progress . This transfer is accomplished by , first , coloring each arrow to show the proportion completed ( thus finished activities are indicated by a completely colored arrow ) ; second , by crossing out the estimated durations of completed activities and inserting the actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the original earliest and latest finish times in the " time-box " of all completed events and superimposing ( in color ) the actual completion time ; and , finally , by indicating in pencil the expected completion time of all activities in progress . The network is now up to date . It is so revised at every review period . If all the activities are on schedule and no difficulties are anticipated , there is no more to be done until the next review period . If , however , some activities are not on time , the earliest and latest finish times of all future events are then computed from the new data and written in above the " time-box " at each event ; in this way , the currently estimated project completion time ( and cost , if desired ) , as well as the current critical path , are determined for all to see . If this estimate is acceptable , the project may continue as scheduled ; this simply means that the current status of the project is tolerated until the next review @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project duration prove unacceptable , two remedial courses are available . The first course is to recover the position by manipulation of available resources within the present network concept . Redistribution of manpower and equipment will introduce new characteristics in the diagram and may produce new critical paths ; any changes will be apparent as soon as the network model is analyzed . The proposed remedial scheme is rescheduled and costed . If this is satisfactory , the project may proceed on this new schedule with new control  | events ; if not , further resource redistribution may be tried . It may be possible to recover the position entirely without recourse to compression . If not , crashing of critical activities is the obvious first step . The second course is to design a completely new network model from the current position to the project completion event , introducing new construction methods and/or equipment , together with other additional resources , in order to maintain the desired completion date . The new total cost is then determined . If this position is acceptable , the project is rescheduled and proceeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternative plans may be devised until finally the cheapest overall solution is obtained . The greatest advantage of CP 1I is the logical determination of the proper activity for attention in order to bring a late program back on schedule . Overtime may be necessary if the works must be speeded up ; but instead of accelerating the whole project , CPM indicates the key operation for overtime working , thus saving unnecessary expenditure on unimportant activities . To assist in the visual appreciation of the network diagram , and particularly in considering the status of the job at any given date , it may be helpful if the diagram is drawn as a time-scaled network , as in Figure 3.9b . Alternatively , " time contours " may be added to the diagram , as in Figure 9.2 . Various other refinements , warranted by the type and magnitude of the project , may be devised as visual aids , such as codification of each resource pertaining to an activity or the use of symbols I , II , and III , to denote shift work . For foremen and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this may show all floats , etc. , and should be kept up to date whenever the network is revised . In short , every endeavor should be made to keep all personnel informed of the current status of the project . 9.5 EXAMPLE OF NETWORK REVISION DURING CONSTRUCTION : THREE-SPAN BRIDGE The principles of periodic network revision presented above are illustrated in Figures 9.2 and 9.3 which demonstrate the simple techniques of project control as applied during the construction of the three-span bridge discussed in Chapter S. The final plan for this project was shown in Figure 8.4 and entailed the pile-rig crew working a 45-hour week . It was decided at the beginning of the work that the first two major review periods would be at day 50 and day 100 , and the " time contours " for these dates were drawn on the network ( see Figure 9.2 ) when work began on the site .  | From the status reports at day 50 , it appeared that no serious problems had as yet arisen . By day 100 , however , it was obvious that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event 9 had already lost all but one day of its available float . The corrected durations of completed activities and the forecast finishing times for future activities are clearly seen on the revised network at day 100 ( see Figure 9.2 ) . Although precasting , in-situ concreting , and falsework were satisfactory , it was essential to prevent any further slippage of the pile-rig operations ( activities D and E ) ; only 1 day 's float was now available in this chain . The slippage to date was about 12% : 85 days had been consumed , instead of the 76 days originally allotted . The future timetable could only be maintained , therefore , if the pile crew 's working time was increased from 45 to 50 hours per week ( i.e. , a 10-hour day ) ; this increased productivity would allow the originally allotted durations for activities on the chain 9 ? 11 ? 13 ? 17 ? 20 ? 21 ? 22 to be retained . This chain , having only 1 day 's float , was now virtually critical , but further slippage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activity 21 ? 22 ( E5 , not yet crashed at all , see Table 8.1 ) . After these remedial measures were taken at day 100 , work proceeded reasonably on schedule , with regular project reviewing every 10 days , until unprecedented cyclonic weather caused a general loss of 8 days by day 200 ; the status of the work at this date is seen in Figure 9.3a . Logical investigation clearly showed that the position could be retrieved without any crashing of unfinished activities ; in fact , the current network should continue to run 8 days late ( Figure 9.3a shows the position ) until event 22 was reached on day 238 . Thereafter some rearrangement of resources would allow part of activity L to begin earlier than originally planned , and similarly some of activity F4 could be done before K3 was finished . The revised network shown in Figure 9.3b demonstrates how the 8 lost days were fully recovered without any necessity for remedial action until 38 days after the slippage was discovered . Without CPM it is certain that immediate speeding-up would have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to bring the works back on time ; such immediate acceleration was not only uneconomical , but entirely unnecessary . 9.6 RESOURCE CONTROL ? RESTRICTED RESOURCES It was shown in Chapter 7 that , by means of the resource leveling technique , labor and equipment , materials , and other resources can be allotted to or distributed between the various activities of a project at the final planning stage , in accordance with their respective availability ,  | so as to present the construction manager with a feasible plan and schedule with which to start the job . It goes without saying that , whenever a change occurs in the original plan during the construction of the works ( due to delays or any other cause ) , the revised plan must be reviewed with regard to resource distribution in order for the new schedule to present the optimum use of available , or newly introduced , resources . This resource reviewing is not difficult , requiring merely resource leveling calculations based on the revised network model . Project control of these common vital resources is therefore linked with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using techniques already fully described . There is another type of resource , however , which is extremely vital , but which can not be controlled directly on site in the normal way , based on consideration of the current activity status of the project . These are known as restricted resources . One example is the amount of project finance that has been budgeted as coming from progress payments ; another is the amount of storage capacity still unused . Both of these may be vital and must be kept under control , yet neither can appear in a network diagram , because , in each case , the quantity of restricted resource to be controlled is the difference between two other resources or quantities of work . On most projects there will be some restricted resources which must be watched intently , for the completion of particular activities or events earlier than scheduled may have to be prohibited , because of these restricted resources . It should be clear that , for job finance from the progress payments , the restricted resource is the difference between the actual amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revenue earned ( and received ) by the works . The dictum for this type of restricted resource is that it shall always exceed a specified minimum . Consequently , since progress measurements may be expected at certain fixed dates , costly activities may have to be programmed for completion as late as practicable just before these measurement dates ; in this way , the expenditure is delayed as much as possible , although ensuring that the revenue derived from such costly activities is earned as soon as possible after the expenditure was incurred . Provided that the requirements are clearly defined , the technique of resource leveling may be used ( on a-trial-and-error basis ) to make certain , both during the planning and later during the site control of the project , that the terms of this restricted resource are net . With site storage problems the dictum is again the provision of a minimum restricted resource at all times ; this can be very important on a restricted construction site or when delay appears likely to one of  | the relevant activities and not the other , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delivery of an item and its use or erection into the works . As an example , consider the three-span bridge project planned in Figure 8.4 . From the chain 2 ? 14 ? 15 it is clear that , for the rate of production envisaged for this casting yard , at least 116 days ( and at most 147 days ) precasting production must be stored on the site ( T2E = 30 ; Ti = 146 and Ti = 177 ) . If activity 14 ? 18 can start earlier than day 100 by faster production in activity 2 ? 14 , or if event 15 is delayed beyond day 177 , then in each case the storage requirement increases . With this type of restricted resource , therefore , the dictum is not only that a specified minimum must be provided , but ( perhaps ) that a certain maximum must not be exceeded . Suppose now that the bridge site had ample space for storage of 116 ( lays production from the casting yard , but only enough to cope with a maximum of 125 days output @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must then be scheduled with its EST of 146 and its LST at 155 provided that event 14 is prohibited from occurring before day 100 . ( Notice t hat T = 155 is quite satisfactory for T to = 135 and t101 ; = 20 . ) Leveling of all other resources would then have to be dependent on retaining these restrictions on event 14 and activity 15 ? 19 . When this project was reviewed during construction at day 100 ( see Figure 9.2 ) , T5 had become 153 and would therefore be just tolerable ( 7 ' ; ' , would still be 155 ) ; in the event , T15 became 154 , as shown in Figure 9.3a , so that a restrictive situation was barely avoided . Had this occurred , it would be necessary either to obtain additional storage space for temporarily housing the bridge units or to close down production ; in both cases extra costs would be incurred . Restricted resources , therefore , are constraints and must be specified ns definite minimum ( and also perhaps definite maximum ) requirements around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dune this , the wise planner then prepares an alternative scheme for the construction manager , showing what is the most economical remedial course to take if the restricted resource constraint is violated ; thus , for the duration of the project , the position can be reviewed regularly and preparations initiated for remedial action as soon as the first signs of trouble appear . Although restricted resource constraints can not be directly delineated on the network model , at least their requirements may be designated Indirectly at the events and activities concerned . For instance , for the three-span bridge project , the following information could be added to the network diagram ( Figure S.4 ) .  | 1 . On the chain 2-14-18-22 , the maximum rate of casting to be permitted 2 . On the chain 15-19-22-23 , the minimum rate of erection required 3 . Near event 15 , the maximum storage available . Project planning and control with restricted resource constraints may be easily handled by manual methods during resource leveling ; it is necessary , however , that the events and activities affected by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activities , so that their remaining floats are known , before any other activity shifting is undertaken . If this procedure is to be handled by computers , however , it will be necessary to resort to project simulation . In this technique the machine simulates a group of activities linked by the restricted resource , working on preprogrammed resource distributions and instructions ; after exhaustive computations using all feasible distributions ( which the computer can do in a very short time ) , a series of results is presented , enabling a decision to be made expeditiously as to the best combination to meet the restricted resource constraint at minimum cost . In the example of the three-span bridge , the computer could have simulated the casting yard and produced the vital information of storage space required with different combinations of production and erection rates on the site . Simulation by computers is not actually a feature of C , but it is nevertheless briefly mentioned here because of its adoption in connection with complex projects constrained by restricted resources . 9.7 PROJECT CONTROL IN BUILDING CONSTRUCTION Because of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fruitful field for using CPM1 in project control . Indeed , it has been acknowledged by many experienced construction managers that only since the introduction of CPMMI have they really known where the project stands at any desired time . To obtain this result , however , p formal system of progress reporting is essential ? and this is particularly true when a building construction company is carrying out more thaq one major project at the same time . Although the simple status repor of Figure 9.1 may be quite satisfactory for general purposes , sometliin more is required when intensive control is desired on complex buildin operations . Various systems of progress reporting can be devised , each suited to th problems of the particular construction work and of the building compan involved . One very effective system , designed for use where a comps ' ) possesses planning offices covering large operational areas , is current ) used on many building sites ; the following description of this projo  | control system is by courtesy of P. E. Consulting Group ( Australia ) Pty Ltd . For adequate control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first is a daily job progress return , illustrated in Figure 9.4 , which is made out on the site by the foreman , or perhaps by the project supervisors , depend- figure  | ing on the size and scope of the job . It should be filled in no later than the evening of the day to which it refers so that it is available to the office the next morning . Its circulation will depend on circumstances , but it should certainly go to the project manager and to the planning office ( where the project networks were originally prepared ) . This daily report is simple to use and requires very little time to compile . It is divided into three sections . The first shows the activities completed today , and the second the activities started today , whereas the third section lists those operations that are now five days before their LST . For each of these activities identification is by their network node numbers ; the labor skill coding , the activity description , its total float , its latest start or finish day number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the critical days lost ( if any ) are all shown in the appropriate columns . The first two sections , which merely list the activities finished or begun , enable keeping up to date the records in the planning office . It is obvious that , where the days before LST or LFT ( as appropriate ) is a positive number and there are no critical days lost , this part of the project is well under control and indeed ahead of schedule . The third section of the report has two purposes . First , it serves as a warning that activities are due to start shortly , for as soon as an operation first appears here it has only 5 days to go before its LST will expire ; thus 5 days warning of possible trouble is given . Second , it forces the site personnel to look ahead at least 5 days , and hence focuses their attention on preparations for starting an activity , as well as encouraging them to always look ahead in conducting the job . The second control document is shown in Figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and weekly statement . It is made out by the foreman ( or supervisor ) immediately after the first report and lists the activities overdue for start or within 5 days of their LST . I t. therefore takes the items from the third section of the daily job progress return and adds to them any activities now overdue for starting . Needless to say , if the project is entirely on time , this document becomes it " nil " return ; if , however , any critical activity is late ( or a near-critical one is becoming late ) , this second report provides both information to that effect and a directive for taking action . The activity node numbers , operation description , days before LST , critical days lost , labor skill coding , critical man or machine days lost , and the reason for being behind , schedule are all shown on this return , which is forwarded to the project manager and the planning office every day . Again , this daily return fore the site personnel to look at every trouble spot in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by giving the ( ntie , il days lost ) , and then state the reason for being late .  | Once a week these second daily returns are summarized on an identical form , and the area manager 's approval ( or other instruction ) obtained for the action taken or proposed . Thus the weekly statement then becomes the remedial directive . The project manager has the responsibility of seeing that action is taken to recover the lost time . This action will , of course , depend on the circumstances of the case . It may be necessary only to increase the resources being used or to make some slight change in the methods of working ; he therefore completes the ninth column of the summary . Where the delay is more serious , however , it may be necessary for the planning department ( or the purchasing department ) to take specific action and to reschedule part of the project ; or it may be necessary to investigate in detail why some supplier or some subcontractor is not producing material or services on schedule . A meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement of the daily summaries is considered and discussed and any further action agreed on . The tenth column of the form is then completed , the whole form photocopied , and sent out by the area manager for immediate action by the appropriate officers . If desired , the same form can be used for a monthly summary to the general manager , or to the Board of Directors ; with this monthly summary from each project , a complete picture is presented of all the trouble spots in the operations of the company and of the action being taken to overcome them . It is also abundantly clear which projects are under control and not behind schedule in any way . 9.8 USE OF COMPUTERS IN PROJECT CONTROL In complex construction works , comprising over 300 or so principal activities , the planning and scheduling are usually done with computers to save the planner much tedious and repetitive manual computation . Even if the network is reduced ( by suitable grouping of activities ) to less than 300 activities in the planning stage so that manual methods can b @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ construction if the formerly grouped activities are now returned to their individu identities . As has been said , a concrete wall may be treated as one a tivity during project planning , but should be expanded into its constitu ent formwork , reinforcement , and concreting for adequate project contr and costing . For this reason alone , computers may be required during si construction where manual methods were adequate during the origin planning . Furthermore , project control includes not only the processing of tivity status reports and the consequent network revisions , but also t  | costing and accounting procedures discussed in Chapter 10 , which are not necessarily part of the reviewing of day-to-day job status . With a computer-oriented control system these phases are combined , and much laborious updating of networks and schedules by manual methods is avoided . The principal advantage of the computer is that the project schedule can be stored away in the machine to be amended and reprinted as a new schedule ( completely replacing the old ) whenever necessary . The basis of the schedule is , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from which activities are identified by their node numbers for storage in the machine . Suitably coded instructions for program changes may then be issued to the computer to be executed when desired ; hence the human effort is directed toward determining feasible changes and not to the laborious recalculation of the new schedule . Several computer programs are available , one of which ( PROMOCOM ) is described in Chapter 13 . It reports the time status of every activity ( on schedule , behind schedule , or overdue in starting , whether critical or not , ( ? to ) , and it provides a new schedule , as well as printing out the critical path together with the three or four next most critical chains through the network . Although this same information can be calculated by manual methods , computers will be essential ( and economical ) with detailed networks comprising more than 300 to 400 activities . When project control is expanded to include integrated cost and accounting control , the computer provides both time and cost status reports for each current activity in the network @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overall financial status , future commitments , value ul ' work in progress , etc . A system of this type was devised for the site control of the construction of the $35,000,000 Sydney Opera House and is outlined in Section 9.9 by courtesy of the contractors , R. Hornibrook ( V.S.W. ) Pty Ltd , and the computer company , Australian General Electric Pty Ltd. 9.9 PROJECT CONTROL AT SYDNEY OPERA HOUSE , AUSTRALIA When completed , the Sydney Opera House will appear as in Figure 9. 6 . It comprises a massive base of cast-in-situ reinforced concrete ( in which the various theaters , stages , amenities , etc. , are housed ) surmounted by fourteen upright shells of precast concrete , stressed down to the foundations . These shells are composed of segments of very complex shape , the total number in the complete structure being nearly 1600 . Some idea of the vastness of the building and of the complexity of the project will be  | figure gained from Figure 9.7 , which shows the work in progress . Its overall dimensions are : 640 ft long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground level to the top of the largest shell . All the segments are precast on the site and are erected ( after curing ) by three Weitz tower cranes , each of 300 meter-tons capacity . Areas available for casting and stacking of segments are extremely restricted , since the site is a promontory adjoining the city proper . Hence it was essential that a coordinated manufacturing and erection program be instituted from the start . To this end , two distinct networks were initially developed , one to cover the casting yard and the other to cover the erection and in-situ work ; these networks were respectively composed of 1400 and 1700 activities . As the project progressed and the number of activities was reduced ( by their completion ) , it was possible to refine both networks and then to combine them into one composite diagram for the remainder of the project ; even then , the combined network contained 1750 activities and 940 events . This network is updated at regular monthly periods or whenever special circumstances may require additional review , using tho principles outlined previously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by computers ; thus the time status of the project is available to management immediately after the close of a review period . Time status , however , is not sufficient . The main problem in prope construction control is to have accurate costs available as soon as possible after the close of a review period . With conventional costing system it may be possible to produce labor costs quickly , but materials costs in evitably lag behind by at least a month ; on this project such a situatio.  | was intolerable , and consequently computer cost control was deemed essential . Although the initial costing and accounting procedures introduced on the Sydney Opera House project were not directly linked to the critical path network control , the entire system was devised so as to require only simple amendments in order to incorporate the necessary features for such a linkage . In this system , the daily labor data are punched on cards , showing manhours against activities and cost dissections . Similarly , all materials orders , invoices , and site deliveries are also converted to punch-card records . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppliers ' names , and the estimated value of the goods . Site delivery dockets show initially the order numbers of the items delivered and the percentage of the total order on this delivery ; later other data are added for costing purposes if the invoice is not available . Invoices show the order number , the invoiced amount , and whether the order is completed . General details of project cost control with CPIN1 are discussed in Chapter 10 . It is sufficient to say here that the principal output from the Sydney Opera House control system includes a monthly cost report showing the cumulative and period costs for each cost dissection ; estimated materials costs are used where the invoices are not yet available Figure 9.7 Sydney Opera House under construction , June 1964 . The outlines of the roof shells are shown . The casting yard in the inuuediate foreground is not visible .  | so that this report may be ready within 3 days of the close of a cost period . In addition , the system reports on future financial commitments , outstanding deliveries , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order . Furthermore , the monthly purchase journal and payment advice slips ( with the supplier 's name and address , ready for mailing ) are also produced . The next extension of this cost control system is its connection to the project network diagram , so that each order shows the appropriate activity number . Whenever the network is updated ( to determine periodic project progress in time ) , the system then presents all the information mentioned in the preceding paragraph , together with the value of work in progress , the value of work then completed , and the value of stock on site . Thus , the entire control information required by the project manager is assembled and presented to him while it is still not more than 3 days old . The ultimate objective , which is only awaiting the introduction of a suitable computer program , is to link this composite progress-control system to a project network based on resource allocation . PROBLEMS 9.1 .

This would still permit completion in 104 days . On day 35 status reports showed that all work was on time except the culvert at Ch.96 , which required 9 days for completion before curing . ( a ) Draw the original network and update it to show project status at day 35 . What is the total delay ? ( b ) What remedial measures can be used to retrieve the position ?  | Financial Planning and Cost Control 10.1 NECESSITY FOR FINANCIAL PLANNING AND COST CONTROL There is undoubtedly room for improvement in financial management and cost accounting in the construction industry . Competition is essential to healthy business , but so are the profits which enable private enterprise to finance contracts , maintain an efficient staff , and make a reasonable return on the money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relatively small profit margins because of keen competition , the financial planning and budgeting must therefore walk hand in hand with first class technical management , construction planning , estimating , accounting and costing ; until this objective is attained , the failure rate in construction companies will remain a serious problem . Financial planning includes correct calculations of the profit margins necessary to provide for fixed administrative expenses , equipment replacement , dividends , and project financing . The maximum economic volume of work which can be handled with a given financial structure must also be known . Essential prerequisities for fulfilling these intentions are , first , an efficient system of budgeting and costing , and second , a reliable and accurate estimating department . Since estimating data are based on production performance and costs , it follows that construction accountants should find CPAI a powerful , quick-acting tool for cost control and an aid in producing more accurate estimating data . Critical path analysis divides projects into activities of short duration so that each activity may be estimated and scheduled logically . In the same way , each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accountant , so that variations from the estimate can be determined as soon as they occur and remedial steps taken just as the construction manager detects and remedies site variations from his original estimated activity durations . By comparing estimated with actual costs as each activity is finished , the financial planning becomes more accurate . Furthermore , it may be 237  | adjusted as necessary while the work is in progress , just as the actual construction work is adjusted to meet remedial changes in the network model . " Costs to complete " become more reliable and are repeatedly tested as the various activities are concluded . In addition , the cost accountant conversant with critical path procedures will be able to introduce techniques for evaluating quickly the effects of either slackening or crashing of any operation on both activity and total project costs . By breaking down direct costs into labor , materials , plant charges , and so on , for each activity , the actual cost of each completed operation can be quickly analyzed and compared with the estimate , just as the physical progress of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ department can be notified of all significant variations in cost performance and all costs may be annotated to show whether they originated from normal , crashed , or partially crashed operation . The estimator thus has access to more detailed and meaningful cost histories on which to base forthcoming contract bids . With reliable estimating and accurate cost control , the required profit margin may be properly assessed . Furthermore , a close working relationship will develop between the estimator , the accountant , and the manager because of benefits accruing to each from adopting CI'Af as a logical solution to their problems of planning and controlling work and resources . 10.2 USE OF CRITICAL PATH METHODS IN FINANCIAL PLANNING In preparing the overall financial plan for a project , it is necessary first to examine closely the network model , and from it to schedule the essential site costs that must be expended in executing the works ; this is readily computed from the activity timing and activity direct costs , to which is added the indirect expenditure at its appropriate rate of occurrence . A plot of these total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required . The next step is to fix the gross profit margin to be added to this particular bid . This depends on the annual gross profit plan for the company and the ratio that the value of this particular contract bears to the total contracts ( gross turnover ) expected to be obtained . From past records and normal accountancy practice this profit can be determined as a lump sum or ( as some companies prefer ) as a particular amount per manweek of the average labor force annually employed . In the latter case , for example , if the average overall work force employed by the company in the immediate past has been , say , 10,000 manweeks per annum , and if this particular project has an estimated labor content of : 3:300 manweeks per annum , then it would be marked up with a profit sum equal to 33%  | of the total gross profit per annum which the company requires in order to stay in business . ' The major advantage of CPI in this connection is that it provides more accurate estimates of project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimating procedures . Having added this profit margin to the total site costs , and priced out the contract bill to equal the total bid amount required , the network diagram ( or its bar chart schedule ) now provides an accurate program from which to calculate the rate of cumulative income-earning capacity of the project , in accordance with the progress payment provisions of the contract . This is then superimposed in the usual way on the plot of cumulative site expenditure , to give the financial investment required by the project . Again the advantage of CP11T is the accuracy attainable in these calculations , so that the maximum and average overdrafts , and the period for which they are required , are accepted with confidence . A further direct advantage of CPII is that the gross profit plan of the company has been founded on a system which , in practice , will enable the work to be done within closer budgetary limits than is otherwise attainable , and hence the profits earned are close to those anticipated ( except in very unusual circumstances which could not possibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to watch the volume of business obtained , and to interpret the profit consequences with reasonable precision . The most important feature of CPl1 in construction finance , however , is the use of compression and/or decompression to determine logically and mathematically the optimum duration of a project for least overall cost . By this feature alone one determines with certainty the most economical plan for doing the whole contract . This , in turn , ensures obtaining a reasonable proportion of available work , and hence meeting the financial requirements and profit planning of the company . The accountant will therefore be quick to appreciate the potentialities of CPII network analysis for more efficient administration of financial affairs . ' In the development of a fully detailed construction plan for a project , the first use of critical path scheduling was to obtain the optimum project duration ; then , by means of resource leveling ( see Chapter 7 ) , to take ' Gross profit required is the sum of head office costs , business promotion costs , planning and estimating costs , capital retention for future growth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profit to be paid as dividends to the company 's shareholders . s Some accountants comment that precise utility data for crashing ( as well as the compression calculations ) are difficult to estimate ( and execute ) . It is well to remember that about two-thirds of all activities never deviate from normality ; and that , in the other one-third , few eventually reach full crash . Optimal solutions , therefore , may be satisfactorily derived from reasonably approximate data ( see Section 8.2 ) .  | advantage of the float times of noncritical activities to obtain a more even distribution of labor and other resources , and even to vary the sequence of operations . Next , the final network model was examined in order to determine the overall project financing and profit margin , and thus the total contract price was derived conformably with the adopted project plan . The detailed budgeting for material , labor , plant or other resources required , and for the funds necessary to finance the project , may now be developed . Budgeting ( or forecasting ) for the plant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project network has been established ; and future variations necessitated during construction can be easily dealt with , because the altered requirements are known well in advance . Finally , from the costed network the total project expenditure and income can be budgeted accurately . This financial resource budget is arranged so as to fit in with the general overall budgeting for the company 's operations ; by further resource leveling ( if necessary ) the requirements for , say , cash flow can be suited to the availability of funds . This can obviously be very important with a large company having a number of projects at the one time . Cash requirements can be accurately foreseen , and the peaks and hollows which normally occur can , to a certain extent , be smoothed out . Consider , for example , the sewer main extension project discussed in Section 8.5 , where the network for the optimum solution was found to be that shown in Figure 8.7b , and the total works cost was determined as $161,080 ( see Figure 8.8 ) . After resource leveling , the final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expenditure indicated at A ; from this the works expenditure curve is plotted in Figure 10.2 . The gross profit markup was fixed by management at $18,000 , giving a contract price of $179,080 . It was specified that progress measurements would be made every 4 weeks ( 20 working days ) , with payments ( less 5% retention ) due 20 working days later ; on this basis anticipated income was calculated and added to the bottom of the schedule , as shown at B , and the works income curve then added to Figure 10.2 . As will be seen , the maximum financial accommodation required is $36,380 midway through the job , with a general average of about $25,000 . Management thus has an accurate forecast on which to arrange the necessary finance . It must not be forgotten , however , that the accuracy of any budget depends on the accuracy of the data on which it is based . This maxim is important , because not only does financial planning include the cash resources required to support the required expenditure , but also the income to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conclusion of the project . Although the expenditure and income-earning capacity may be speedily planned with reasonable accuracy , it is essen-  | figure tial to realize that the client may not be so meticulous in payment of claims . Although one can not perhaps provide against such a contingency , one can nevertheless use the critical path network to determine ( from available float ) which activities may be postponed until the cash position is rectified ; or , alternatively , if additional cash resources must be obtained elsewhere in order to carry on , one can assuredly determine from the network schedule the most economical sequence of activities to pursue . Finally , in the development of the financial plan , one also determines the major monetary control points for the project . These subsequently  | become the main network events , around which is built the structure of the cost control system to be initiated as soon as work commences on the site . 10.3 USE OF CRITICAL PATH METHODS IN COST CONTROL It is not proposed to expound here on details of the conventional accountancy methods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to point out that , with the introduction of critical path procedures for the planning and site control of construction operations , it has become essential for construction engineers to learn something of works accountancy and for cost accountants to familiarize themselves with this new mathematical technique . This applies to both vocations , whether they are engaged as professional practitioners or as salaried officers in construction companies or in management advisory services . Furthermore , by this new management tool , improved communication is achieved between the construction engineer and the cost accountant : both can now speak the same language , both can now see the project from the same viewpoint , each can readily learn and understand the procedures and the objectives of the other in their respective daily tasks . It will be realized at the outset that an estimate is intended to be a reliable forecast of probable costs ; as such , no matter how accurate , it can only be an opinion . Costs , on the other hand , are the actual historical records of expenditure incurred ; as such , they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recorded for all the activities in various types of projects , they provide invaluable data for the calculation of future estimates . This accurate correlation between estimated and actual costs has only been practicable since the introduction of CPiI drew attention to the great significance of the activity in construction . The concept of the activity as a costable unit is the basis of a new accounting philosophy . The works items customarily provided in a bill of quantities are only remotely connected with the actual detailed operations to be performed , and a costing system based on these items or similar work subdivisions can not provide proper works control . With the new philosophy , however , each activity is planned with an estimated duration and cost , and it is then a very simple matter to compare these with actual performance in time and money as each activity is completed . Estimates of the percentage of work completed to date are eliminated ; the actual accomplishments for each activity are a much more precise measure of the progress of the works . Herein lies not only the advantage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the required answers for both estimators and management .  | The use of CP1I , therefore , simplifies for the manager his task of controlling the costs of a project and provides him with more accurate information from which to prevent losses occurring . It can also simplify the overall accounting function through the integration of costing with the general accounts . There are many ways of achieving the degree of control and integration required , and it is therefore sufficient to present here only the main points and principles involved . In industrial operations , one compares the actual cost with the " standard cost , " which is ( as its name implies ) a standardized cost for the operation or work under consideration , and is determined by some analytical process such as work study . In construction this is not feasible , because of the wide variations in the nature of the operations ; control must therefore be based upon the estimated cost . This is indeed a very satisfactory way of achieving control , for the profits of any construction project are also based on estimated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimate , then the profitable operation of the work can be ensured . Where cost control systems are based on critical path methods , the requirements of accuracy and speed , in the production of the results , will make the network somewhat more complex . It is necessary to break up the job into more detailed activities and to bear in mind the objects of control when preparing the diagram . For instance , it is preferable to have , wherever possible , only one trade or one crew in each activity . Furthermore , activities should , as far as practicable , have durations not exceeding 1 week ; those which would normally take longer should ( except for operations like delivery of materials , approval of plans , etc. ) be split into two or more activities . This will allow effective control to be exercised over continuing activities by drawing attention to variations from the estimate as soon as they occur during the execution of prolonged site operations . The scheduling of the network includes the duration of the activity , the number of men required , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the estimated direct costs of labor , plant , and materials . For activities that will be subcontracted , only the duration and total direct cost need be recorded , and these should be as agreed on with the respective subcontractors . The total of these estimated direct costs , plus the preliminaries and other indirect costs , together with the contractor 's overhead and profit , equals the contract price . The estimated direct costs are recorded on a cost card or ledger sheet ; each activity is identified by its node numbers in the network . Thus the cost classifications match the defined work items shown in the network model as specific activities ; this is a most important feature of this method of costing , as will be understood shortly .  | In order to avoid unnecessary duplication , it is preferable to integrate the cost accounts with the general financial accounts as the work proceeds . At the beginning of the project , each activity account , an overhead account , and a preliminary account would be credited with the estimated costs , and the total of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be made to these figures for any variations as received , and also for variations occasioned by provisional items . Labor Costing The foreman or supervisor records the hours spent by site labor on each activity in the usual way . The total gross payroll is then debited to a labor variance account weekly , and the weekly summary of manhours spent on each activity is used to debit the labor costs to each activity account ; the total of these debits is then credited to the labor variance account . It goes without saying that basic timekeeping information must be reasonably accurate ( as has always been the case for construction costing ) , for it will be obvious that time is the unit by which all productive and unproductive labor is controlled against the estimate . The introduction of C has emphasized the significance of time , and it has also added two other important factors : rate of work ( normal or crashed ) and crew size . It is therefore a waste of clerical effort to compute money costs for each activity or each labor skill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observations of crew size , overtime or other premium payments , and variations in the average overall project manhour cost rates ) which enable the actual performance to be measured against the estimated performance or its site revisions . When required , the gross manhours spent ( luring a cost period may be readily converted to money at the average overall project manhour cost rate currently applicable . From the start of a project right through to its completion , one is thus able to compare the actual with the estimated manhours for each activity , or for common services or indirect operations , and in total . On appropriate occasions one can check the efficiency of the crew sizes by applying two or more different teams to the same operation and comparing their productivity per manhour . The former detailed periodical labor cost statements are replaced by manhour expenditure statements , showing , for each activity : 1 . The estimated time required . The time spent to date . 3 . The time remaining in the program . 4 . The time required to complete the operation , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anticipated gain or loss on the time allowed . 6 . On completion , the actual time gained or lost , and its percentage effect on the total labor content of the project . Figure 10.3 illustrates a statement of this type ; these manhour reports place the proper perspective on labor costing , both for estimating and for project control . One further aspect of labor costing deserves further consideration ; this is the unit of work to which labor costs should be equated . Traditionally all labor charges in the past have been costed against some type of material unit , such as cubic yards of concrete , square feet of formwork , tons of steel , and so on . It is now being realized that this is , in many cases , most unsatisfactory . Dr. R. H. Clough has pointed out ' one classical example in the conventional method of measuring labor for concrete stair soffit forms on a square foot basis : " The labor costs associated with this construction are about the same for a four-foot wide stair as for a six-foot wide stair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more area per lineal foot . Here , as in many similar instances , it is preferable to ascribe a labor cost per job rather than to use a labor unit . ' " Every construction estimator knows that the prediction of labor costs is the most difficult part of his work . This is the field in which he requires the maximum amount of help from the cost accountant . The real cost of labor is the number of manhours required to perform a specific work task . With CPA , the recording of reliable labor costs has become possible , for each relevant work task may be shown on the network model as a separate and unique activity . Activities representing specific work tasks must be devised around suitable crew sizes and labor skills . The site costing of these individual work task activities , over a wide range of projects , will eventually enable the compiling of labor task costs . This will then provide the estimator with the proper figures on which to base his future predictions , for he will then have real values , based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual work processes is not new , as such ; its importance has , however , been emphasized by the introduction of C , and its development into " activity costing " has resulted . What is new is the concept that labor costing and manhour productivity records must show the size ( and skills ) of the crew and especially whether the activity was completed at normal or crashed speed ; in crashed speed , the nature of the speeding up overtime , shift work , and so on and the percentage of full available crash should be indicated . Only when such cost data are availConstruction Contracting , Richard II . Clough , John Wiley and Sorry , New York , " Estimating and Bidding , " Chapter 6 , Section 6.21.  | able will the estimator be able to prepare really practical utility data for his compression calculations . Materials and Services Costing The system adopted for ordering materials and services , including subcontractors and for collating the commitments incurred , must follow wellproven methods , designed to ensure that purchases do not exceed the planned distribution of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planned by CPM , the purchase orders are allocated to individual or groups of activities by the appropriate activity numbers . To reduce the volume of clerical work , the quantity of orders issued should be kept to a minimum , but separate orders must be directed to each service , commodity , or collection of materials purchased from one supplier ; and separate orders must be likewise issued to each subcontractor . From the network model of the project , the materials schedule will show the total quantities ( and prices ) required , the delivery dates to be met , the allocation of quantities and expenditure to each activity , the estimated rate of expenditure , and the total materials fund for the project . Every purchase order should stipulate the first three of these , so that the supplier or subcontractor may be well aware of the requirements he is expected to meet . On receipt of materials at the site , the delivery notes are marked with the activities in which the material or service will be used , showing the quantity for each where the delivery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system may lead to a larger number of smaller deliveries , but this in itself provides a very effective control . The delivery notes are immediately checked against the appropriate purchase orders , and are then priced and extended , thus obviating delays arising from waiting for the invoices . These extended delivery notes are used to debit the activity accounts , and the corresponding credits are made to a materials variance account . The debits to the materials variance account are made from the purchase journal , and the balance transferred to a project profit and loss account . Cumulative figures of actual and estimated costs of certain materials ( such as cement and bricks ) may be separately maintained , if desired , to provide a check against spillage or theft ; serious discrepancies disclosed by these figures may then be investigated . Subcontract performance and costing follows a similar pattern . It is essential in this case that the subcontractor , in submitting his price , is made fully aware of the requirements of the project network and of the effect on the project duration of his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for assessment of the subcontractor 's performance ; his progress payments will be computed at each of these con-  | trol events . During the construction it will be necessary for all parties to cooperate in any desirable replanning , and to define and value variations promptly , so that activity modifications may be adopted without delay when network revision is to be undertaken . Plant and Equipment Costing As with labor , the number of productive hours worked ( in this instance , by the machine ) is vitally important from a costs viewpoint . Plant operation , like labor , is therefore recorded as the time spent on each activity ; and from this it follows that the weekly summary of machinehours consumed ( for each class of machine , if necessary ) on each activity in the project is the basis from which to begin the costing by debiting plant costs to each activity account and crediting the total to a plant variance account . This principle applies , whether the plant is hired from an outside source or whether it is owned by the contractor ( irrespective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he may do by an internal hire system or by a specific expense write-off ) ; the same processes are used for costing plant and equipment as were used for labor and materials . Unlike labor , plant productivity may often be estimated with reasonable certainty . Costs are therefore generally estimated against the traditional units ( cubic yards of excavation , lineal feet of trench , areas of finished surface , etc . ) . Nevertheless , there are still a number of machine tasks where the conventional unit cost is not a true measure ; it is in these cases that only CP VI provides a satisfactory alternative by enabling plant costs to be evaluated for individual tasks represented by unique activities in the same way as labor costs may be determined for special work tasks . To be of value as a control criterion , performance is required in machine-hours , and the periodical plant costs should be presented as planthour expenditure statements , covering each activity , as was described for the presentation of labor costs ( see Figure 10.3 ) . Costing Overheads and Indirect Expenses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unproductive work items , preliminary operations , project services , final clean-up , and various other necessary tasks which are usually included ( for estimating and costing purposes ) in the indirect costs . In this way these important ? and sometimes costly ? items are portrayed as unique individual activities on the network model , and hence in the costing system ; thus they may be separately recorded and reviewed in the project cost returns .  | There is indeed no limit to the multiplicity of overhead and indirect charges which may be separately portrayed in this way , except that of practicality and economy . A detailed breakdown should not be incorporated in a network merely to accumulate the costs of trivialities , but only if this will serve some useful purpose either in project control or for future estimating . Where , however , they are of importance , their delineation as network activities will enable regular and accurate evaluation of their magnitude and seriousness ; they may thus be watched by management as site construction proceeds . The manner and extent to which indirect expenses are thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the duration of the project to a whole complex series of short duration each . Many items of site expense and overheads are worthy of attention in this way on a major project . Indeed there has been a scarcity in the past of reliable information concerning indirect costs ; with the use of CPDI this lack can be rectified . Periodic Cost Reports and Accounts For cost reports to be of real value , they must be up to date , accurate , and regular . The use of the activity as a costed unit enables all these objectives to be achieved . As was mentioned in Section 9.9 , the monthly  | detailed cost report for a complex project comprising over 3000 activities can , with the aid of computer processing , be presented to management within 3 days of the close of the costing period . On smaller projects , without resorting to computers , comparable speed may be attained . These cost reports should present not only the costs to date plus forecasts of costs to complete each unfinished activity , but also cumulative valuations compared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicate the gross profit so far attained and the final profit now envisaged . A suitable cost report of this nature is shown in Figure 10.4 . In such reports , the current and future predictions may be progressively adjusted to follow the vagaries of the work in hand . At the same time , economies or excesses may be readily assessed , on similar forms to that of Figure 10.3 , with respect to labor , materials , plant , site overheads , etc. , as may be expedient . In every cost period the main accounts are brought up to date . It will be remembered that the daily job status reports described in Chapter 9 show which activities have been completed . At the end of each week ( or other suitable period ) the accounts for the activities finished that week are closed off , and the balance transferred to the project profit and loss account . The journal entry shows , for the information of site management , any significant variations from the estimates which have occurred ;  | a copy of this information can also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preparing future estimates . The cost-to-complete account is credited each week with the total estimated costs of the activities finished that week , and this is in turn debited to the client 's account . Each month the client 's account is also debited with the overheads and other indirect costs incurred that month and the cost-to-complete credited . The client 's account is also debited with the profit earned , and this amount is credited to the project profit and loss account . The accounts for overheads and other indirect costs are debited with these items as they occur , and a monthly and cost-to-date report and budget prepared in the usual way for controlling these items . Where the cost and financial accounts are integrated , clerical procedures are oriented to the rapid preparation of periodical " Profit and Loss " and " Income and Expenditure " statements , as well as balance sheets , overhead expense analyses , and statements showing the source and distribution of funds . With these regular up-to-date reports , management is in a position to review and properly control its construction operations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Directors and the company Secretary will therefore appreciate the benefits deriving from the speedy presentation of financial accounts through their integration with a project costing system based on CPM techniques . 10.4 PROFIT CONTROL The cost report illustrated in Figure 10.4 presents not only costs , but valuations as well , thereby enabling the gross profit position of a project to be constantly watched . For a company with several projects in hand simultaneously , a similar form may be used to summarize for top management the overall operations of the organization , so that the periodical changes in total gross margins are regularly under review . For rapid assimilation , actual profits may be plotted against planned profits , both for individual projects and for the entire operations . Based on project networks , these figures are not only accurate and currently up to date , but remedial proposals ( when required ) may be rapidly analyzed on the appropriate network models . Where an element of uncertainty is present in forecasting future trends , the three time predictions ( and corresponding costs ) of the PERT technique may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logic and precise mathematics . In this way the element of risk in taking important decisions is calculated , if not entirely removed , and the relative effects on profit evaluated . As a further point , consider a single project in which cash is becoming  | critical ( because progress payments are late or for any other reason ) ; an examination of the network model will at once disclose where advantage may be taken of available float to defer purchases or other expenditure , thus temporarily reducing the finance required ( and the interest payable thereon ) until the cash situation can be rectified . This technique of resource leveling is a most useful adjunct to the planning and control of finance and profits . The incorrect prediction of profits through inaccurate estimating is immediately apparent when costs and valuations are related to network activities . When this position arises , true forecasts of future trends may be predicted from accurate current site costs to date , applied to the unfinished portions of the network . It must be conceded that this is much better than the sometimes current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimation can be expected to be perfect , and from time to time remedial actions will be necessary ; with CP-I their relative effects may be logically analyzed before the situation becomes serious and alternative strategies may be given ample consideration before a final decision is taken . Profit planning , like project planning , is capable of analysis on a network model . It follows that profit control , like project control , is more accurately achieved when based on CPM. 10.5 PERIODICAL CLAIMS FOR PROGRESS PAYMENTS The costed network can be put to a further use in valuing the work done for progress payment claims . The treatment required will depend on the nature of the construction and on whether the bill of quantities allows for preliminaries and temporary works as separate items or not . If the preliminary and temporary works are separately itemized and paid for , the costed network can be used for progress claims as it stands ; if the contract is one in which the cost of all nonpermanent items is spread over the specified permanent items in the bill ( say on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added to the estimated activity costs to arrive at the price for each activity . In either case the network , with suitable variations , still forms the basis for arriving at the amount of each periodical progress payment claim . There is , however , one very important point which must be appreciated when the costed network is used for this purpose . In the planning , and in the cost control system discussed previously , the cost figures used in the network model for each activity are the estimated direct costs ; indirect costs and site overheads are regarded as extra activities , and are so costed , but these values on the network are still estimated costs . Monthly prog-  | ress claims , however , must be calculated against the contract prices shown in the contract bill of quantities . Clearly , the difference between the estimated direct cost of an activity representing a billed item and the contract price for this item is the amount of estimated indirect cost and the profit pertaining to this item . It is not difficult to convert the estimated direct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the bill by applying a standard percentage correction ; this approximation is usually reasonable enough for the purpose of progress payments , from which a retention amount will doubtless be withheld in any case . When the overheads and profit markup are spread evenly throughout the direct cost estimate , this method is precise . However , when the overheads and profit are varying from activity to activity , or from one section of the project to another ( as may be the case on some projects to suit particular circumstances , or to suit the cash flow required ) , some complexities will arise although the costed network can not then be adopted directly , a system can be devised to cope with the situation . ' One of the great advantages , in the restriction of the duration of each activity to a maximum of a week for costing purposes , is the ease with which sections of the project may be assessed for the proportion completed at the close of each costing period . It will be obvious that the internal costing periods , and the periods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : first , so that costs , valuations , and progress claims may be compatible and second , so that duplication of clerical work is avoided . There is no reason , however , why costing periods should not be fractionally shorter than payment periods , if this is advantageous to project control . The critical path network , each activity of which has a predetermined income payable by the client and an estimated expenditure incurred by the contractor , has thus provided the construction manager with the simplest means of preparing cost records , works valuations , and claims for progress payments . It also provides an accurate assessment of costs , both direct and indirect , involved in works variations which may be ordered by the engineer or architect during the construction period , 1 The reader may appreciate this situation better by studying the sewer main project schedule shown in Figure 10.1 . In the financial planning of this job the indirect costs are to be recovered at a uniform rate with time ( irrespective of the direct cost value of the work done each 20-day period ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percentage onto the total works cost . The contract bill is then priced so that progress payments may be claimed every 20 working days directly in proportion to the total works cost . The uniformity of the rates of expenditure and income is apparent from Figure 10.2.  | thereby substantiating legitimate claims for extras ( or deductions ) logically and mathematically . Furthermore , the effects of delayed performance by suppliers or subcontractors and of enforced delays occasioned by the client ( or his engineer or architect ) can also be determined with precision , so that recompense for such delays may be claimed with reason and justice . The method of evaluation of the costs of variations and delays follows in Chapter 11. 10.6 CONTROL OF LIQUIDITY In Section 10.2 the finance chart for the sewer main project was developed for the first-crash solution . This plan leads to a maximum overdraft of approximately $36,000 and an average overdraft of $25,000 . The adoption of other plans leads to different overdraft requirements . Figure 10.5 indicates the financial requirements of the three plans developed for  | the sewer main project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project duration decreases , the rate of total works expenditure increases , and both the average and maximum overdraft similarly increase . If the overdraft requirements are plotted against project duration , the graphs of Figure 10.6 are obtained . Using these graphs , it appears that a project duration of about 300 days would require a maximum overdraft of $25,000 and an average overdraft of about $18,000 . Clearly , in certain circumstances , it may be necessary to schedule a project to suit available overdraft limitations rather than to adopt the all-normal solution or the least total cost schedule . In addition to project finance requirements , the estimated demand on cash resources for a project can be determined once a schedule has been evolved . Figure 10.7 , for example , indicates the cash demand for the first-crash solution for the sewer main project . The inclined lines represent cash outflow and the vertical lines correspond to the monthly progress payments ( income ) . The actual cash demand is , of course , complicated by many factors , such as the time delay in account billing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the precise time when materials are landed on the site , and equipment hire charges ( especially if the equipment is owned by the contractor ) . In these situations the overdraft schedule shown in Figure 10.7 may be excessive ; it should be possible to carry the project on a lower overdraft , because the actual cash flow out may be lower than indicated . Nevertheless , the general  | shape and characteristics of Figure 10.7 will still pertain and should be studied carefully . Then adjustments can be made toward more realistic monetary budgets . Obviously , the cash requirements of Figures 10.5 , 10.6 , and 10.7 are estimates only , and the actual amounts needed during construction will in most cases be different . Indeed , by management decision during the course of the work , the cash flow can be varied by activity shifting within available float , or by changing from one construction plan to another . This may become essential in order to eliminate or alleviate a critical cash deficiency . If another construction plan is used , the project duration may change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the duration of the project will not alter . If a broader view is taken , it is possible to relate all existing and planned projects to the overall liquidity situation ( or working capital ) for the entire organization . In this way CPM can help formulate realistic policies , especially regarding the commencement dates for new projects and construction rates to suit available liquidity . Figure 10.8 , for example , may indicate the estimated company cash commitment or working capital status for a specific budget period , say for the next 21 to 3 years . Committed expenditures for current and planned projects are drawn on this chart to indicate the total cash demands on the working capital during this period of time ; incidentally , similar techniques can be used  | to indicate other resource 's requirements . In this way attention can be focused on problems such as the decision to bid for new projects , determination of project duration , and optimum start times , so that financial crises in the company can be planned for , if not eliminated . In this view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scale that can be shifted within float to suit the resource requirements of the entire company . Thus the project duration for the new project , and its rate of works expenditure , can be considered in the same way as shown previously for activities , using resource leveling concepts and network compression techniques . At the same time , allowances can be made in the working capital budget for investments such as new equipment purchases and other capital expenditures . It must always be remembered that these cash requirements are estimates , and must be updated with actual facts as the data become known . Clearly , then , in estimating for a budget period , cash flow requirements must be regarded in a probabilistic sense , and there must he sufficient  | float , when several projects are added together in time , to allow for unexpected cash flows arising from unforeseen situations , change orders , and so on . Whatever the situation , however , it will be clearly realized that cash flow requirements computed from the network give a more reliable and realistic view than other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associated data processing and retrieval facilities enabled progress and cost control of the type outlined in Section 9.9 to be adopted at the Sydney Opera House in 1962-1963 . Since then , further developments in computer programs have permitted network-controlled accounting procedures to be introduced to the construction industry ; thus management may have readily available reliable and regular information concerning the financial status of the entire organization , as well as the detailed time and cost status of every project in progress . Accounting data comprise first , the necessary entries for each individual financial account , whether debit or credit ; second , a series of financial accounts subdivided into assets , liabilities , expenditure , income , accounts payable , accounts receivable , and so on ; and third , the information ( derived from these financial accounts ) to be entered in each line of the financial statement of the enterprise . Hence , if all the financial accounts of the subdivisions are totaled , the result is the entry for that subdivision in the financial statement , and from these statement entries the balance sheet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each individual financial account originate in one of the projects in progress or in the head office , and are suitably referenced to a particular set of cost accounts . Each of these cost accounts , whether they are for a particular project or for central administration expenditure , represents an activity on some CPII network , so that the entire system of accounts is based on activity costing , as described at the beginning of Section 10.3 . These cost accounts begin with the estimated quantities and costs appropriate to the account . For a project these will be the estimated direct costs of labor , plant , materials , and services , or the estimated indirect cost if appropriate , whereas for head office accounts they will begin with the budgeted amount for the period . As work progresses , these cost accounts accumulate data comprising actual quantities and costs as these occur , and thus they form the basis of the periodical project cost reports referred to at the end of Section 10.3 . In addition , payroll processing is included in the accounting system , so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ac-  | counts , but also wage data are collected into separate employee record files , where each individual 's earnings and deductions are accumulated . Control of works in progress is obtained by simultaneous updating of the project cost accounts and the project network . The resulting information provides the basis for the regular revision with respect to duration and cost of all activities not yet completed . From this updating of each project follows the ability to update the financial records of the complete organization . The result of this combination of CPM with project cost reports and overall company financial status provides management with a dynamic and realistic tool for reporting on current conditions , predicting future results , and proposing changes in methods and procedures to improve performance . PROBLEMS 10.1 . Consider a simple project consisting of two parallel and concurrent activities A and B. Contract conditions specify that progress payments are to be made every t days with payments ( less r% retention ) due t days later . Given the following data : figure Draw the project finance chart showing the effects on overdraft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days . 10.2 . In the sewer main extension project considered in Section 10.2 in the text , the finance chart of Figure 10.2 is derived from the bar chart schedule of Figure 10.1 , assuming uniform distributions for direct costs over each activity duration . Determine the effect on the overdraft requirements for the project if : ( a ) ( i ) $6000 can be considered as an initial landed direct cost for activity 4 ? 13 on its first scheduled day with the remaining $32,100 distributed uniformly over its duration of 154 days . and ( ii ) activity 5 ? 9 similarly has an initial landed direct cost of $8,000 with the remaining $28,500 distributed uniformly over its duration of 139 days . ( b ) the contractor owns the excavation equipment used in activities 4-13 and 5-9 and the two landed direct costs represent internal equipment rental payments .  | Evaluation of Work Changes and Delays 11.1 LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS In the construction of nearly all civil engineering and building projects there will usually be a number of changes in the volume , nature , and order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the start . The term " work changes " is used to refer to all alterations , variations , deductions , extras , or omissions of this nature , whether the works are executed by day labor or contract . The magnitude of these changes depends on a number of factors , not the least important of which include the thoroughness of site investigations undertaken prior to the design , the completeness of the working drawings available at the time of preparation of the estimate or proposal , and unpredictable circumstances ( luring construction . Some of these work changes may result in a variation in the actual cost of the project ; others may not . Again , some may require additional time to perform , others may require less , whereas some may have no effect at all on the project duration . Although these effects are important on any project , they present a vital financial problem on works carried out by contract . In addition to work changes , delays to various parts of a project may also occur , due to eventualities such as late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contractor or his subcontractors , tardy provision of detailed drawings , protracted inspections and approvals , shortage of labor strikes and industrial troubles , unusually inclement weather , enforced retardation of work to suit the owner or other contractors on the site , and financial problems . Some of these delays may result in late completion of the entire project , whereas others may have no effect on the total construction time . All these delays usually cost money . The problems of work changes and delays occur in all contracts , whether firm price or prime cost , but are more difficult in firm price for obvious reasons . With prime cost , the cost is always paid by the owner , 261  | but if he is to treat his contractor reasonably , there should be adjustment of the fee and the contract time . In the preparation of all general conditions of contract , it is therefore necessary to anticipate and provide for such work changes and delays , and to place a legal liability on one of the parties to accept financial responsibility for them . Usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the work without vitiating the contract , and that they shall be valued by the owner 's engineer ( or architect ) and the contract price ( or fee ) adjusted accordingly . In addition , if the work is delayed , the engineer ( or architect ) is empowered to extend the contract time under certain circumstances . Delays can be divided into three categories : ( 1 ) those over which neither party to the contract has any control ; ( 2 ) those over which the owner ( or his engineer ) has control ; and ( 3 ) those over which the contractor ( or any subcontractor ) has control . It is generally recognized in modern contracts that delays of type ( 1 ) are part of a contractor 's normal and legitimate monetary risk , and hence should give neither party grounds for monetary recompense , but that the engineer should extend the contract time in order to protect the contractor from any resulting liquidated damages for late completion . It is also recognized that for delays of type ( 2 ) the contractor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and time , whereas for type ( 3 ) delays the contractor should get no recompense at all . In law , claims by a contractor for time and cost recompense for work changes and delays due to the acts of the owner are validly reimbursable except when expressly provided otherwise in the contract conditions ; but the law also requires the parties to take all reasonable steps to minimize the time and the cost . The method of evaluation of valid claims , for both time and cost , depends on the terms of the particular contract . Usually such determinations are made the responsibility of the engineer ( or architect ) , but he is given no guidance nor any basis on which to make his valuation . In some cases it may be stipulated that changes shall be measured and the value determined from the unit rates stated in the contract ; but this is of no help in determining a valid time extension or in computing a new rate for work of a different nature from that in the contract . Work changes include variations in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a work item is changed ; they consequently result in more or less cost and time to execute the varied item ,  | and they usually require some rearrangements of resources . Alterations and extras both change the nature of the work and may involve resource replanning as well as changes in costs , whereas the time to do the work may or may not alter . Omissions usually mean less cost , but not necessarily less time , and may result in wasting resources . Frequently , a work change is a mixture of types , as in the omission of one item and its substitution by a variation , alteration , or extra ; or there may be a double variation with a deduction from one item and an addition to another . Whether the work change is a mixture of types or not , there is no simple path to its proper evaluation . In practice , when cost and time are not agreed on before the changed work begins , the contractor submits a price for the change , and probably also a request for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the engineer ( or architect ) two serious problems have been created : determination of a fair cost and evaluation of a reasonable time . With respect to compensation for delays , contract conditions presently in use vary greatly in their provisions . Even if they were all in agreement that time extensions will apply only for type ( 1 ) delays , and that time and cost may be recovered in full for type ( 2 ) , the problem remains of assessing the extra time and/or cost attributable to each delay and of applying this to the project as a whole . It may first appear that only the evaluation of delays of types ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) is of prime interest in contract administration , since reimbursable delays fall within these two categories . This is , however , fallacious because if two delays are concurrent or overlapping , that is , one of type ( 1 ) or ( 2 ) and the other of type ( 3 ) , it becomes essential to evaluate both in order to determine the resulting overall effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two problems of fair cost and reasonable time have been created . Acting for the owner , the engineer ( or architect ) tends to minimize the value of such work changes and delays , whereas the contractor 's natural reaction is to maximize them . Often much unpleasant dispute occurs . This is a continuing problem in contract administration , because no principles for computing time extensions or costs are provided in a contract . Furthermore , in practice , all construction contract rates include not only the direct cost of the item , but also a proportion of the indirect costs , overheads , and profit for the entire project . Hence any change in the quantity of work , or in its nature or order will affect the return to the contractor of some or all of these components of his contract rates . I n addition , when a contractor carries on some work while experiencing delay in other items , he will encounter labor and plant inefficiencies due to the discontinuity of his program and the necessity to reallocate his  | resources ; to be fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cost of the work change itself . The legal requirement is therefore to establish a principle for the determination of time and cost for any eventuality . It should provide for evaluation of the net effect of a number of concurrent changes and delays , as well as the net result of a multiplicity of occurrences on site performance and productivity ; and it should also enable a determination to be made as to whether the contractor had the ability to perform within the contract time if he had not encountered the various changes and delays . Probably the most valuable feature of CPM is that it enables the required principle to be established . On a project planned and controlled by network analysis , the contractor 's original network program depicts the basis on which he determined his price and time for the work ; it therefore follows that , if this initial network is accepted as part of the contractor 's bid , any change from this program constitutes a change in the contract , irrespective of whether the change was instituted by the requirements of the contractor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond the control of either . If another network is drawn to show the effects of this change on the rest of the project , then its analysis and direct comparison with the initial network will enable all the resulting time delays to be determined . Since only delays affecting critical paths can affect the project duration , these critical delays may thus be readily examined and their basic causes identified . Equitable evaluations for extensions of time , in conformity with the provisions of the contract conditions , would then be available . If , in addition , the contract schedule provided direct and indirect cost items separately for the various parts of the work , then by analysis of the network it would also be possible to derive equitable monetary evaluations for all the validly reimbursable work changes and delays which had occurred , whether these were critical or not , and to assess these within the terms of the contract . Hence fair and reasonable contract values for both time and cost may be determined for any proposed change or delay , and any advantageous replanning to suit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties concerned , thus enabling agreement to be reached before inauguration of the change . To summarize , therefore , it is clear that the principle for determining compensation in time and cost , for any eventuality affecting the contract work , is the derivation by network analysis of the critical delay ? arising or likely to arise from such eventuality ( bearing in mind the legal necessity for all parties to minimize the effects resulting therefrom ) , together with the calculation of the net cost of such critical delays , and the resolving of liability therefore between the parties in strict accordance  | with the provisions of the contract ( whether these are fair and reasonable or not ) . 11.2 EFFECT OF A SIMPLE VARIATION As a simple illustration of the principle stated above , consider the pipeline construction example for which the optimum solution was computed in Sections 5.7 and 5.8 . The most economical duration was there found to be 102 days , with a corresponding network model shown in Figure 5.7f . Suppose now that this project is under construction and had reached event 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordered to provide an additional 50% of concrete anchor blocks because of bad ground encountered . From the utility data ( Table 4.1 ) , it is obvious that the durations and costs of activity 7 ? 8 ( concrete anchors ) will be increased by 50% , becoming : figure Examination of the network model shows that activities 5 ? 7 and 7 ? 8 are both critical and already fully crashed , so that any increase in the duration t7-8 must delay event 8 and consequently the entire remainder of the project . Since the critical activity 7 ? 8 is to be extended by the extra-work order , it is obviously best to continue it at crash speed , thus delaying critical event 8 by 4 days only . The position is shown in Figure 11.1a , which is a reproduction of the relevant part of Figure 5.7f with the new data added ; the project duration is increased by 4 ( lays and the project direct cost by 260 units ( Tp = 106 and Cp = 13,050 ) , whereas the project indirect costs will increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indirect cost curve in Figure 5.10 ) . At first thought , therefore , the contractor might claim 4 days extension of time , and an extra payment of 745 cost units plus profit . This would not , however , be justified in this case . Notice the looped critical path 5 ? 6 ? 8 : activity 6 ? 8 is not compressed and hence can not be lengthened and cheapened ; but activity 6 ? 5 can be decompressed if required by as much as 8 days at a cost slope of 50 units . It follows then that , since event 8 is only delayed by 4 days because of the extra work , the correct solution is to decompress activity 5 ? 6 by 4 days at a cost saving of 200 units . The result is illustrated in Figure 11. lb , where Tr = 106 and Cp = 12,850 only ; the additional direct cost of the extra-work order thus amounts to only 60 units , and hence the contractor 's expenditure need rise by only 60 ( direct ) plus 485 ( indirect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost units . The additional time required is confinned at 4 days , but the correct extra payment is 545 cost units plus profit . An identical approach may be made for deductions ordered from contract work . It is therefore clear that an arbitrary increase or decrease in price , based on the quantity , extended at the billed rate , may have no justification in fact . The only correct way is to submit the proposed addition or deduction to network analysis and to compute the true value of the alteration by optimal solution , using compression and/or decompression as appropriate . 11.3 EFFECT OF A SIMPLE DELAY Another related problem is the evaluation of delays to the project , either by late performance on the subcontractor 's or supplier 's part , or enforced retardation of work to suit the owner or the contractor . When the contractor is not legally liable for such delays , it has been extremely difficult in the past to calculate and substantiate an actual monetary claim for recompense . Countless arguments have been waged between contractors and owners , or between contractors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situations regarding both the costs and the project duration arising therefrom . With a critical path network the position is very clear , enabling the true time and cost of the delay to be logically and quickly calculated . Indeed this may well be done with advantage when such a delay appears probable , so that the consequences may be appreciated beforehand and the parties thereby forewarned . Consider the case in Figure 11.2 showing ( a ) part of a fully resourcelevelled network in which a skilled crew of 14 men is scheduled to carry out activities 30-31-33-34-35-38 concurrently with 30-32-37-39 as indicated . Event 30 is scheduled for achievement in day T. Suppose now that at day T + 4 the critical activity 29-33 is delayed one day by some cause . To maintain project duration , the work must be rescheduled from day T + 5 to give the network shown in ( b ) . As a result there will be 2 mandays lost at the end of activity 32-37 , event 37 is achieved 1 day early , critical event 35 one day late ( 35A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working overtime on the last part of activity 37-39 , event 39 remains on time . The project is not delayed , no time extension is required , but the direct cost of the work has increased . This remedial solution is only valid , however , if efficient rearrangement of subcrews is feasible . If not , the position will be as shown in Figure 1.1.2c . I ere 10 mandays of labor are lost before event 33 , and  | thereafter critical path I runs 1 day late ; this immediately affects the parallel critical path II , where its entire crew is idle for a day at event 36 . In addition , the noncritical activity 37 ? 39 loses 4 mandays of labor , and event 39 is also 1 day late . The ramifications of the day 's delay to activity 29 ? 33 are , in this case , more complex . Additional time as well as additional direct and indirect costs are required . It is therefore clear that any arbitrary decision regarding time or cost can have no real justification . Even with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to submit the problem to network analysis and determine the true effects of the occurrence . 11.4 CHANGE AND DELAY REPORTING The usual methods of reviewing a project and revising its networks during construction were discussed in Chapter 9 . If , in addition to the regularly updated version of the original network , another network is plotted progressively as the work proceeds , this latter network provides at any given time an authentic record of the work executed to date . Such a network may show , as they happen , all work changes and delays encountered , and the actual starting and finishing dates of every activity . Since it is a record of facts , it is known as a factual network . On finishing a project it provides a complete record of construction performances , the same as work-as-executed drawings provide a complete record of the technical details of the finished structure . When compared with the original program ( initial network ) , it furnishes the data for the evaluation of all time delays encountered during the contract . The initial network may be as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it may show only direct-cost activities and constraints , or it may include a series of arrows for indirect-cost services and operations . The limit of detail is that of useful practicability . Each activity is identified by its node numbers , as usual , but lengthy operations should be broken down into a series of short , consecutive activities for better status reporting . The factual network consists of the same activities as the initial network , plus any others required because of work changes and delays encountered during construction . For reporting regularly on activities in progress , just completed , or about to begin ? or for introducing new activities ? the conventional forms shown in Figures 9.1 and 9.4 are satisfactory ; but further documentation is required for recording work changes and delays in detail . A suitable report form is seen in Figure 11.3 in which a progressive  | account is kept of every occurrence that may affect the time and/or the cost of any activity in the project . Delays from all causes , as well as work change orders , should be included @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparent until later . In Figure 11.3 the first column shows the date that the change or delay became known . The second and third columns are used to identify the occurrence ( by some numerical system ) , and record its basic cause or category . A brief description is reported in the fourth column , followed by reference to site instructions , minutes of meetings , change order numbers and so on As soon as the change or delay becomes known , the record may be filled in to this point . The last three columns are completed subsequently when the facts are available . This record , like the activity status reports , should be kept strictly up to date ; not only does it provide an authentic summary of all eventualities , but also a valuable basis for estimating future performances . It is emphasized at this point that it is quite fallacious to form any opinion about the importance of any single change or delay ; this will not be known until the factual network is analyzed and its critical paths established . This analysis may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dynamic project control . It is axiomatic that the recorded data must be realistic and indisputable ; preferably all information should be mutually agreed upon between the parties , or at least notified from one to the other in writing with adequate substantiating evidence . The prime purpose of change awl delay reporting is not to favor one party or the other , but to establish the facts of the matter .  | 11.5 PLOTTING THE FACTUAL NETWORK The regular status reports ( Figures 9.1 or 9.4 ) provide the data from which may be plotted progressively , as work proceeds , the actual attainments on the site . Any new constraints arising during construction are shown as they occur , so that the network will be completely accurate . This is the skeleton of the factual network . It is a record of facts concerning the times at which each event was achieved , whereas the initial network was merely a plan for doing the work . Direct comparison between the two shows the project status at a glance . Project control and replanning as discussed in Chapter 9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ network at any date , extended by an estimated network to completion ( realistically based on current performance ) . The ultimate effects of such replanning will be reflected in the factual network later as actual attainments are recorded and plotted . If now the data from the change and delay report ( Figure 11.3 ) are added to the skeleton of the factual network , this network will not only show the current time status of the project , but also the causes of all the time changes that occurred . It has become a reliable record of work as executed , with circumstances affecting performance clearly designated . The two ways in which changes and delays may be indicated on a network diagram are ( 1 ) by the use of new and artificial activities ; and ( 2 ) by codified notation on existing activities . Either or both ways may be used as convenient to indicate realistically the significant facts unforseen when the initial network plan was adopted ? that have eventuated during the construction period to date . In Figure 11.2 new and artificial activities are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diagram and enforced " idle " periods in ( b ) and ( c ) . Figure 11.4 illustrates the various ways that delays may be shown on factual networks . Figure 11.4a is a reproduction of Figure 11.2c ; the effect of the enforced delay of one day on activity 29 ? 33 is shown solely by the revised timing of the events . If this enforced delay is designated delay " n , " and if all its effects are shown as artificial activities , the diagram will appear as Figure 11.4b ; this diagram demonstrates clearly the influence on all other affected activities of the direct delay " n " to activity 29-33 . In Figure 11.4c the ramifications of delay " n " are indicated by notation on the existing activities . Different symbols are used to show different  | types of delay , so that the contractor 's scheduled " wait " may not be confused with the enforced " idle " periods resulting from delay " n " ; the duration of each delay is also noted beside it . For ease of progressive plotting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factual and initial networks are drawn to the same timescale . As discussed in Section 3.4 , time-scaled networks are helpful in emphasizing the relative times of achievement of the events , for on a time-scaled initial network the nodes may be numbered in chronological sequence while still preserving the conventional logical order ( arrowhead number always greater than arrowtail ) . With the same events still shown by their initial node numbers on the factual network , examination of the actual sequence of event achievement ( originally planned to be in chronological order ) provides a clear , qualitative indication of work disruption . This is especially valuable with milestone events ( see Section 7.3 ) and interfaces ( Section 15.3 ) . Time-scaled networks also enable float calculations to be avoided , since spare time is shown by horizontal broken lines . Furthermore feasible program revisions are easily seen . Figure 11.5 shows Figure 11.1 plotted to a time-scale ; the possible decompression of activity 5 ? 6 is immediately apparent , as is also the unaffected free float in activity 8 ? 11 . The progressive factual network @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ periodical reporting of project status and claims for progress payments . At any stage it may be used for estimating the effects of current eventualities and for reallocation of resources as critical paths change . As soon as the contract is finished , however , the complete factual network , showing all the facts pertaining to site performance , is immediately available for a realistic determination of the total effect on the project of all the eventualities encountered during its construction . 11.6 ANALYSIS OF FACTUAL NETWORKS Until the progressive plotting of a factual network reaches project completion , it can not be analyzed in the usual way by calculation of earliest and latest finish times for each event . The method of determining current critical paths on a progressive factual network of this type is to proceed backward from the cutoff date , starting with that event exhibiting the greatest tardiness with respect to its original LFT , and to trace back through the network those preceding dependent activities currently having no float , until finally the start of the project is reached . Sometimes several critical paths are apparent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully closed from start to finish ,  | may be analyzed in the conventional manner ; or , since its final event is that showing the greatest tardiness at the date of project completion , it may with equal accuracy be analyzed in the same way as a progressive network . If , as a result of either method of analysis , there should be more than one critical path in the network , each is examined in turn to determine its net working duration . The net working duration of any path through a factual network is found by deducting from its total duration to date the delay times of those work changes and delays ( and only of those ) lying on the path being analyzed . The net working duration is , in fact , the actual time in which all the activities along that path could have been completed if there had been no work changes or delays affecting that path . Having examined all apparent critical paths between two common events in this way , the primary path is determined as that with the longest net @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have been completed in less time than this , even if the delays had not occurred . Other parallel apparent critical paths may be classified as secondary , tertiary , and so on , as their net working durations decrease . The determination of the final primary factual critical path for a project , or for a separable part of a project , can not , of course , be made until its final event has been achieved . It is thus a reliable and accurate determination in retrospect , because it is based on facts and not on estimates , in contrast to the analysis of a progressive factual network extended by an estimated network to completion . Consideration will show that if the net working duration of a final primary factual critical path is less than the total duration allowed in the initial network , then the planned performance could have apparently been achieved if the delays had not occurred . Conversely , if the final net working duration is greater than the initial duration , then it would seem that the original activity times were underestimated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further discussion of this aspect appears in Section 11.7 . Nevertheless , it is possible by this technique to establish the total amount of critical delay experienced by a project to any desired date , and to say generally whether this is due entirely to identifiable causes or to possible incorrect estimation of some of the original activity durations , or partly to both factors . Furthermore , at any time after its completion , a valid analysis may be made of a project in order to identify its overall critical delays , provided reliable data are available . This is called analysis in retrospect . I t will be obvious that any path through a network may be analyzed , if it is of interest to inquire why it has undergone tardiness ; but it is  | emphasized that the overall effects of all eventualities to date on a project as a whole are determined solely by analyzing its primary factual critical path . The total effect of all unforeseen occurrences is the difference between the total actual duration and the net working duration of the project 's final primary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the project . Further discussion of this aspect appears in Section 15.5. 11.7 RESPONSIBILITY FOR CRITICAL DELAYS The responsibility for total project delay may thus be accurately determined by examining critical delays alone ; no other occurrences , whatever the cause , affected the performance of the work as much as those on the primary factual critical path . However , in applying the principle stated at the end of Section 11.1 , it must be remembered that delays on other critical paths ( if any ) also led to protracted performances . Hence examination of secondary and subsequent critical paths is necessary to enable the times and causes of their delays to be similarly determined . By this approach , therefore , it is possible to find all the causes of protracted performance beyond the original completion date , and to apportion responsibility in accordance with the relevant terms of the contract . For instance , if the contract conditions stipulate only certain occurrences as entitling a contractor to recompense , then his proper entitlement is solely the delay times of those specific occurrences that lie on a critical path @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on noncritical paths have no effect on the project duration . Clearly , theoretically the net working duration is the time taken to carry out the work with no critical delays at all . It is also clear that no contractor can expect in practice to achieve this efficiency and must allow for some lost time in his estimate of project duration for his initial network ( see Section 15.5 ) . Consequently , if the net working duration is less than the estimated duration shown on the initial network , the contractor has demonstrated his ability to perform within his estimated time . However , if some of the critical delays are due to causes over which he had control , or to causes for which he has no time entitlement under his contract , these critical " contractor delays " must be added to the net working duration to see whether this total exceeds the contract time . If it does not , the contractor has demonstrated his ability to perform within the terms of his contract . Conversely , if the net working duration exceeds the contract duration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original estiniatcs  | were apparently incorrect because of arithmetic mistakes or optimistic views on site productivity . There is , however , one exception to this situation : if the delays are so numerous or complex that the general site productivity and efficiency suffered , then the apparent inability to perform may be due to this indirect effect of the delays encountered , and not to a contractor 's error or underestimation . Thus he may be validly entitled to compensation if the originating delays are reimbursable . Inability to perform because of this reason is determined by productivity factors , and can only be assessed for the finished project . To do this , a comparison must be made between various undelayed activities in the factual network and their counterparts in the initial network to find examples where the work was , in fact , done under the anticipated conditions ; hence " normal " productivity can be determined in manhours or plant-hours per unit . It is important to observe that this normal productivity is completely unrelated to any estimated value ; it is what is actually achieved on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operations have been delayed on site , their actual productivity factors may likewise be derived . This approach is not absolute , but if it can be established that productivity has decreased when there is no other valid cause , the difference represents a measure of inefficiency attributable to the overall effect of a multiplicity of delays or of enforced piecemeal working . 11.8 PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS Since computer processing of factual networks is not yet feasible , application of these procedures must be carried out manually . This can be laborious on a large and complex project , but it is the only logical way to evaluate the effects of delays and work changes on the intended project construction plan . It is not possible within the space of this book to present the details of the actual evaluation in practice of work changes and delays encountered on several major projects recently concluded . The initial and factual networks , drawn to a scale of one week to an inch , are too large to reproduce , and the analysis of the factual networks for the derivation of the primary and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , appreciate the procedures by studying Figure 11.6 , which shows a series of hypothetical work changes and delays applied to the pipeline construction example of Figure 5.7f . In Figure 11 6a , the initial network ( Figure 5.7f drawn to a time scale ) shows the original plan for completing the work in 102 days . Figure  | 11.6b shows the final factual network , incorporating the occurrences designated in Table 11.1 , and some expediting of certain activities where the contractor was delayed through his own fault , with the end result that the work occupied a total of 116 days . Analyses of all the factual critical paths are presented in Table 11.2 , from which the primary path is shown to be 0 ? 1 ? 2 ? 4 ? 5 ? 7 ? 8 ? 9 ? 10 ? 11 ? 12 , since it has the longest net working duration . As a result of this analysis it is clearly established that the responsi-  | bility for delayed completion of 14 days beyond the original 102 days should be apportioned against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days , work was fully crashed to 4 days ; net delay = 2 days . If the contractor is entitled to time extensions for all causes beyond his control and to monetary recompense for all causes over which the owner has control , then he should receive 14 days extension of the contract time , and an extra payment of 2772 cost units plus profit , computed as follows ( direct-cost data from Table 4.1 , indirect costs from Figure 5.10 ) : figure Notice that , in this example , the contractor took steps ( at his own expense ) to recover the time lost by his own fault , thus avoiding liquidated damages . If he had not , the project would have overrun more than 14 days . In such case he is entilted to 14 days extension plus the above money less the value of liquidated damages incurred . Although it is impracticable ( because of space limitations ) to present here the complete details of an actual project controlled by the factual network technique , Figure 11.7 is included to illustrate some particulars of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a portion  | of the factual network affected by the delays summarized in Table 11.3 , and serves to demonstrate the complexity of a variety of delays of different categories , as well as the method of identifying their causes by symbols defined in the " delay legend " on the drawing ; the specific symbol denoting the basic cause of each delay is plotted on or beside the appropriate activity arrow . Observe also that the original critical path through 41 ? 47 has switched to 40 ? 43 ? 47A ; with a multitude of delays the current critical path differs frequently from the original one shown on the initial construction network . Clearly , although reasonable predictions may be made during works progress , the final total time extension under the terms of a contract can be determined accurately only after project completion , by factual network analysis in retrospect , and should be granted only when contractually reimbursable delays critically prolonged the duration of the works . Once accurate time evaluations are available , equitable cost recompense can readily follow , provided the contract unit rates are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs stated separately , and profit spread throughout as the contractor may desire . A suggested subdivision for indirect costs sums would be the following : ( 1 ) establishment and all fixed charges ( move in ) ; ( 2 ) supervision and administration ( all time-dependent charges ) ; ( 3 ) clean up and dispersal charges ( move out ) . A few overhead and indirect cost items do not lend themselves to this easy classification , but they are usually small and unimportant in comparison with the total ; however , if necessary , they could be shown separately in the contract schedule . It must not be overlooked that the detailed site management of a construction project is the prerogative of the contractor , and that ( unless he is prevented by the contract conditions ) he is entitled to change his original program whenever he chooses , provided he completes the works , or separable parts of the works , within the specified contract time(s) . Hence all such changes must be built into the factual network as a contractor 's responsibility . Furthermore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sequence of operations on the site , as well as to vary the work to be done . This power must be preserved , but in these instances each such change must be built into the factual network as an owner 's responsibility . Another problem associated with claims for extensions of time should also be clarified . Suppose that , with an owner-specified contract period of 100 weeks , a contractor submits a bid with an initial network offering  | completion in 70 weeks , and that on revision for sundry changes and delays by the owner the final factual network shows that the project took 90 weeks . Is the contractor entitled to time and indirect-cost recompense for the additional 20 weeks ? Under present contract conditions there need be no extension of time , and hence no monetary recompense other than unit rate payments for the changed work ordered , since the specified contract time was not exceeded . Under the factual network concept , where the initial network is part of the contract , the contract time becomes 70 weeks , and the contractor is entitled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time occasioned by the owner . Hence bid proposals must be based on realistic construction times , if they are to be competitive , and preplanning must be tempered with practical allowances for normal delays rather than with fictitious activity durations . The factual network concept is a powerful management tool ; but it is a double-edged tool available to both owner and contractor . With the initial network as the basic contract program , all parties are aware at the outset of the time available for provision of details , samples , final approvals , material deliveries , and so on . With each updating of the progressive factual network , all parties know of the gains or losses of time in the various activities , and of the remedial measures and/or replanning necessary to maintain the desired progress . Contract rates are more realistic , yet none of a contractor 's private cost information is disclosed . Disputes are minimized and hence bid prices are lower . There are better relations between contracting parties , and more efficient construction administration . Finally , at every stage of the project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis for future planning in order to find the best way to finish the works from the currently existing status . PROBLEMS 11.1 . Draw the network shown as the answer to Problem 7.3 to a time-scale as an initial network , with resources requirements tabulated beneath . Suppose now that , because of work changes required by the owner , the following additional activity times and resources are imposed on the contractor figure Suppose also that only one equipment A and one equipment C are available . Determine the correct extension of time and the additional direct costs ( ex-  | pressed in mandays and equipment-days ) due to the contractor and draw the revised network to the same time-scale . 11.2 . Draw the original network shown as the answer to Problem 9.2a to a time-scale as the initial network for this project . Beneath it , to the same scale , draw the factual network incorporating the following work changes and delays . figure If the contract provides for time extensions only for weather delays and for time and cost recompense for extra work and delays caused by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the completion of the project ?  | An Introduction to Program Evaluation and Review Technique 12.1 INTRODUCING UNCERTAINTY INTO THE NETWORK Planning and scheduling with CPM require a reasonably accurate knowledge of time and cost for each activity , for the CPM network model is essentially deterministic . In many situations , however , the duration of an activity can not be accurately forecast , any time estimate being subject to doubt . If such an activity lies on a noncritical path having considerable float available , the usual CPM calculations remain valid , but there will be a local uncertainty in resource leveling and in the scheduling of men and materials , equipment , and finance . If , on the other hand , the activity lies on a critical path , the project duration and the scheduling of at least all subsequent critical activities become uncertain , unless sufficient resources are made available to crash the activity at will ; if this is not possible , uncertainty becomes a factor in the construction project and must be reflected in the network calculations . PERT ( Program Evaluation and Review @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and project durations . It is therefore well suited for those situations where there is either insufficient background information to specify accurately utility data or where project activities require research and development . PERT uses an activity duration called the expected mean time ( te ) , together with an associated measure of the uncertainty of this activity duration . This uncertainty may be expressed either as the standard deviation ( at ) or the variance ( vta ) of the duration . The expected mean time is intended to be a time estimate having approximately a 50% chance that the actual duration realized will be less , and a 50% chance that the actual duration will exceed it . From this it is clear that the formal determination of such activity data necessitates using a proba-287  | bility distribution curve for the activity completion times . Since no information actually exists regarding the probability distribution of activity completion times and since its determination is not feasible because activity durations are subject to random disturbances and delays , it is necessary to assume a probability distribution curve . To ensure tailoring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activity , three engineering time estimates are made and embedded within the theoretical curve . These three estimates of the activity 's duration enable the expected mean time , as well as the standard deviation and the variance , to be derived mathematically . The optimistic time ( ta ) is an estimate of the minimum time required for an activity if exceptionally good luck is experienced ; it is not a crashed time ( unless the three time estimates are being made for the crashed completion of an activity ) . The most likely time ( t , , ) is based on experience and judgment , being the time required if the activity is repeated a number of times under essentially the same conditions . The pessimistic time ( to_the ) is an estimate of the maximum time required if unusually bad luck is experienced ; it may take account of an initial failure or delay , but should not be influenced by major hazards ( such as floods ) unless these are inherent in the activity . The calculation of these three time estimates forces the planner to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the activity . They tend to offset the effects on the planner 's judgment of known target dates . They become the framework on which is erected the probability distribution curve for the activity duration . The general shape of this curve is shown in Figure 12.1 , where it is seen that there is a peak ( or mode ) corresponding to the most likely time ( CO . This peak may take up any position within the range of the distribution to conform to the characteristics of the activity under consideration ; this range is roughly that defined by the optimistic ( ta ) and the pessimistic ( to_the ) times , because these time estimates represent extreme cases having little chance of being realized ? and therefore these two times have very small probability . A probability distribution curve that can represent this situation is called the beta-distribution . In this curve mathematically simple ( and slightly conservative ) approximations can be made for the activity 's expected mean time and its standard deviation . The expected mean time is derived from the following equation :  | The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread of the distribution curve about its mean value ) is given by .... Finally , the variance is defined as the square of the standard deviation , so that vte = ( o ) 2 = ( ib 6 to 1 ' ( 12.3 ) From equation 12.1 , except for a symmetrical distribution ( where t ? + to_the = 2t , n ) , the expected mean time ( le ) will be different from the most likely time ( t ) , as indicated in Figure 12.1 . Furthermore , since the optimistic ( ta ) and pessimistic ( to_the ) times have small probabilities of attainment ( 1% chance is usually assigned to these two time extremes ) , they approximately define the range of distribution of feasible activity durations . The standard deviation , measuring the uncertainty , is onesixth of this range ; consequently , the smaller the range becomes , the more certain becomes the activity 's duration . In the limiting case , certainty of an activity duration occurs only when the three time estimates coincide , so that the standard deviation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in C calculations are assumed theoretically certain , and thus may be considered as special cases of he more general time estimates used in PERT . By adopting activity expected mean times , the critical path calculations proceed as before . Associated with each duration in the PERT  | approach , however , is its standard deviation or its variance . The timing of events thus computed will be expected mean event times , and consequently subject to doubt ; the measure of this doubt in the timing of the events requires the derivation of event standard deviations . The computation of event standard deviations and variances is amply illustrated by considering the project completion event as follows . The project duration is determined by summing the activity expected mean times along the critical path and will thus be an expected mean duration . Since the critical path activities are independent of each other , statistical theory gives the variance of the project duration as the sum of the individual variances of these critical path activities . Therefore , for a project duration of expected mean time Tx1 ' , VTXP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 0-e ) 2 ( 12.4 ) from which the standard deviation of the project duration is easily determined . If more than one critical path exists , the project duration variance is taken as the maximum of those summed along the various independent critical paths . From this it is clear that the variance of the expected mean time of any event is the sum of the variances of those activities along the most time-consuming path ( in terms of expected mean times ) leading to that event . Once the expected mean time for an event ( Tx ) and its standard deviation ( vrx ) are determined , it is possible to calculate from probability theory the chances of meeting a specific event scheduled time ( Ts ) . To do this the event completion time is considered to have a normal probability distribution with the mean value Tx and a standard deviation 0-Tx , determined as before from the series of individual activity beta-distribution curves . This hypothesis implies that the effect of adding a series of independent beta-distribution curves gives a curve of normal distribution ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approximately true in practice with reasonable-sized networks . Hence , to calculate the chances of meeting the time Ts , it is necessary to plot a normal distribution curve centered on time Tx , as illustrated in Figure 12.2 . With this curve , the probability of meeting the desired scheduled time Ts is obtained by determining the percentage of the area cut off by this time from the total area beneath the normal distribution curve as shown . Instead of plotting a normal distribution curve each time , the practical approach is to use standard probability tables prepared for normal distribution functions , of which a condensed version is given in Table 12.1 ; it is emphasized that determining probability to the nearest 1% is more  | accurate than is generally required in construction practice and hence condensed tables are adequate . To use this approach , the difference between the scheduled and expected mean times for the event is scaled down to the standard curve by computing a factor Z , where Z=Ts ? Tx 0Tx Using this computed value of Z , a direct entry into Table 12.1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interpolating in the table , if warranted ) as will be demonstrated shortly . An equivalent form of equation 12.5 enables the scheduled time for an event to be determined , based on a given risk level ; thus 7 's = Tx + Z 0-Tx ( 12.6 ) where the value of Z is obtained from Table 12.1 for a specific probability or risk level acceptable to management . In the PERT technique , time is the essential factor to be analyzed , for it is useless to introduce costs until the time predictions and the likelihood of achieving these predictions have been determined . It will be clear to the reader that , apart from the probability feature , much of the PERT technique is similar to CP1Y1 ; indeed , there is a certain amount of overlap between the two , as will be seen in the remainder of this chapter . It is proposed here , however , to pursue the procedures of PERT only far enough to enable the construction planner to introduce uncertainty into a network should the necessity arise ; the full ramifications of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this book .  | Although the time analysis of an activity requires the evaluation of three time estimates , from which the expected mean time , standard deviation , and variance are computed , the PERT time analysis of a network uses only the expected mean time and the variance of each activity ; this is sufficient to introduce into the network diagram the uncertainty iii each individual activity . Because a single time estimate is used , PERT calculations for network analysis differ from the corresponding CPM calculations only in the introduction and handling of the activity variances . As an illustration , consider again the pipeline network of Chapter 4 . Table 12.2 shows the individual activity time estimates required for a PERT analysis , together with their computed statistical time information . The three time estimates for each activity have been so arranged that the expected mean times ( te ) are identical with the CPM durations ( ti ; ) ; this will enable the reader to make a direct comparison between the two methods of network analysis . The PERT network calculations for the earliest expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event variances ( VxE ) are shown in Figure 12.3 . The times TxE are computed in exactly the same manner as the EFT of CPM ; they are tabulated in the E rows of the event " timeboxes . " From the chain of activities that determines the time 7 ' , -H of each event , the activity variances are summed to give the variance 1'xs  | applicable to each event , and this value is also entered in the E row of the relevant " time-box " ( see Figure 12.3 ) . Thus , for example , for event 5 , the earliest expected finish time and its variance are computed from the figure This particular value of VSIE is adopted notwithstanding that the summed variances along the chain 0-1-3-5 is 177.59 , a value considerably larger than 46.65 . The uncertainty involved in satisfying event 5 is the uncertainty of the chain 0-1-2-4-5 ; PERT calculations ignore variances along chains that do not determine the earliest expected mean times of events . In practice , however , the chain 0-1-3-5 ( with considerably more uncertainty ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is satisfied . This fact emphasizes the need with PERT to control the project with dynamic review techniques , for otherwise the computed critical paths may have no significance in practice . Discussion of PERT critical paths follows in the next section .  | Referring to Figure 12.3 , it will be observed that event 12 , and hence the project itself , has an earliest expected finish time of 122 days , a variance of 74.41 , and therefore a standard deviation of 8.63 . This information is used to define a probability distribution curve for the project duration . In networks containing many activities this distribution tends to become ( and in practice is assumed to be ) a normal distribution ; therefore the distribution curve for the pipeline project duration will be similar to Figure 12.2 , being centered on the TXE of 122 days with a standard deviation of 8.63 days . From these data it is possible to compute readily the approximate probabilities of meeting specified or selected target dates for completion of the project , as shown in Table 12.3 . In a similar manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time for any event can be found , once the event 's earliest expected mean time and its variance are available . There is a theoretical difficulty for events close to the start of a project , because these event times and variances can hardly be considered as having a normal distribution ; nevertheless , for want of better information , this assumption is made in practice , and ( although in error ) gives an adequate indication of the magnitude of the probabilities involved . It will now be clearly understood that the scheduling of particular event times for a project requires an assessment of the uncertainty in the project and the acceptance by management of the risk levels in the desired schedule . As a preliminary to the actual scheduling of particular event times with specific risk levels , it is often an advantage to determine the latest expected finish time ( TxL ) for each event , based on a neutral or 50% chance . In the pipeline project , this determination would be made from an expected project duration of 122 days , and the calculations then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in CPM calculations . The corresponding event variances ( aTxL ) 2 are derived similarly to those  | for the TxE variances , starting from the project completion event ; these results are shown in the L rows of the event " time boxes " in Figure 12.3 . Examination of these " time boxes " will show that , in some cases , the TxE and the Txz values are different ; this difference is called the event slack , and is expressed mathematically as Slack = Txz , ? TxE ( 12.8 ) Slack in PERT corresponds to the total float concept in CPII , and is a measure of the flexibility available in a project schedule . An event with zero slack must therefore lie on the expected critical path . Two variances are now applicable to each event , VTXE and V , TXL . The first measures the uncertainty in the most time-consuming path ( computed on te for each activity ) up to the event under consideration ; and the second measures the uncertainty still to be encountered along the most time-consuming path from this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events on the expected critical path , the sum of the two variances must be constant ; that is , VTx + VTXL = VTXP ( 12.9 ) In the pipeline project , the total variance for critical events is 74.41 . Suppose now that a project duration of 122 days is not acceptable and that completion in 117 days is demanded . With CPI this reduction would necessitate the crashing of one or more activities by applying more resources to the project ; with PERT , however , this 5-day reduction may be available without activity compression if favorable conditions are met in completing various activities . Hence , if a schedule is adopted on the assumption that these favorable conditions can be expected , then it contains the risk that , in fact , these conditions may not occur ; and the magnitude of this risk may be computed from the statistical time data for the project . Figure 12.4 shows a schedule for the pipeline project , giving a duration of 117 days . A detailed discussion of this schedule is unnecessary , but the scheduling of activities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will be seen that for each activity the pessimistic time  | includes an allowance for rain , a hazard inherent in both these activities . However , although the individual pessimistic times must consider this rain hazard independently , it is reasonable to assume that both activities collectively ( being sequential in the project ) will have less rain hazard than they have separately ; in other words , the combined risk is less than the sum of the individual risks . If the difference between the most likely and the expected mean times is considered to be the allowance for rain , then a scheduled duration for one of the activities equal to its expected mean time ( te ) would enable the other to be scheduled at its most likely time ( tm ) , or even less , with reasonable safety margin for the combined operation . In the case of the pipeline , since event 5 also depends on the chain 1 ? 3 ? 5 , activity 4 ? 5 was scheduled at its expected mean time ( 30 days ) , whereas activity 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) of meeting good conditions and fine weather , enabling its completion in 19 days ( a time midway between its most likely and its most optimistic durations ) ; the risks involved in this schedule for events 5 and 7 will be found in Table 12.5 . It will be seen in Figure 12.4 that the adopted schedule for activity and event timing has produced a change in the critical path from that shown in Figure 12.3 ; instead of the expected critical path , the project  | now has a scheduled critical path . The risks in achieving this schedule may now be calculated for every event in the network , based on the scheduled time ( Ts ) , the earliest expected mean time ( TxE ) , and its variance ( QTXE ) 2 . In Table 12.5 are the results of these calculations , where the risk for each event is expressed as the probability of achieving the time Ts . 12.3 PERT CRITICAL PATHS The actual time consumed in completing an activity is only known when the activity is finished . If informed time estimates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice should lie within the range covered by its optimistic and pessimistic times . However , its actual duration , relative to its most likely time and its expected mean time , depends on circumstances not easily foreseen and generally beyond control . Consequently , the expected critical path , based solely on activity expected times , can not always be realized ; it is , however , of great assistance in estimating the overall expected project duration and for testing the feasibility of various scheduled project durations . The number of activity chains which may , in fact , become the actual critical path for the project depends on the form of the network diagram and the characteristics of the individual time estimates for the activities . Figure 12.5a illustrates a very simple network from which the time when event 3 can be reached , along the three possible chains , is readily determined in Figure 12.5b . It will be apparent that each chain can be completed within a large and different time range . The completion of the project requires the finishing of all three chains , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the three time ranges for the three chains . It can be easily shown that the optimistic critical path , the expected critical path , and most likely critical path all follow chain I activities , although the pessimistic critical path follows chain II activities ; in fact , it is not difficult to imagine valid scheduled durations that would permit any one , or two , or all three of these chains becoming critical paths through the project . This fact emphasizes again the need for continuous reviewing techniques in PERT project control . In some cases certain chains of activities can not influence the project ( lunation and therefore can not become critical . However , in many instances considerable doubt exists as to which chain will lie on the critical path , because of the complexity of the risks involved . But it is always possible to compute ( with reasonable approximation ) the probability that a given chain , or portion of a chain , will become critical ? and then to assess the situation with respect to the relative chances . p 300 The timing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Figure 12.6a shows that event 5 is reached along the expected critical path ( chain I ) in an expected mean time TEI of 68 days , with a variance of 46.65 . Event 5 is also reached along the expected noncritical chain II in an expected mean time TE11 of 50 days with a variance of 177.59 . The problem is to determine the probability that chain II becomes the critical path , and hence the probability that it will determine the timing of event 5 . If the probability distributions for chains I and II approximate , or may be assumed to approximate , normal distributions , the problem is simple . Statistical theory shows that the difference of two independent normal distributions is itself a normal distribution , with a variance equal to the sum of the two component variances . The probability curve for the time difference ( TE1 ? TF11 ) is a normal distribution , located symmetrically about the time difference value of 1S ( lays , with a variance of 224.24 , and hence a standard deviation of approximately 15 , as demonstrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two  | chains are considered only from event 1 ( the branching node ) and that variances are considered relative to that node . The probability that chain II becomes critical is then the probability that the time difference ( TE1 ? TE11 ) becomes negative . From Figure 12.6b and Table 12.1 , the area under the curve on the negative side of the zero value is 12% of the total area under the probability curve . Therefore the expected noncritical chain II has only a 12% chance of becoming the critical path to event 5 ; and hence the expected critical path ( chain I ) has an 88% chance of determining the timing of event 5 . If three or more chains terminate in an event , the determination of the probability that any one of these will be the critical path is much more complex ; the problem is simplified somewhat if the paths are not interconnected and are independent , but the statistical treatment of these situations is beyond the scope of this book . If desired , an approxi-  | mate solution can be obtained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comparing separately the other chains with it , one at a time , as discussed previously . 12.4 PERT NETWORK COMPRESSION Since the three time estimates are used to define a probability distribution for the duration of an activity , it follows that scheduled activity durations which are progressively smaller than the expected duration have progressively smaller probabilities of being realized . In fact , as the scheduled duration approaches the optimistic duration , the probability of meeting the schedule rapidly approaches zero . In particular circumstances , however , activities must be scheduled for smaller durations that those normally specified and yet have a high probability of attainment . Consequently , the basis on which the time estimates were made must be reviewed and altered , subject , of course , to making available additional resources for the activity . By using this approach , a series of probability distribution curves can be defined for various durations of an activity , corresponding in essence to the CPM concept of activity compression . Figure 12.7 shows a typical arrangement for the probability distribution curves for the normal , partly crashed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is obvious that in some situations very favorable circumstances may make the use of additional resources unnecessary , whereas , on the other hand , extremely unfavorable circumstances may more than offset the advantage presumed with such additional resources . These considerations again illustrate the dynamic and fluid situations which PERT techniques may have to assess .  | It is clear from Figure 12.7 that considerable simplification results if geometrically and proportionally similar time estimates are assumed ; that is , if it is assumed that the optimistic and pessimistic times are fixed proportions of the expected mean time . In that case , figure where r1 and r2 are two specific ratios which may be evaluated . This device enables all partly crashed and fully crashed time estimates ( and variances ) to be related to the particular compressed expected mean time assumed . By adopting a scheduled expected mean time tes the following equations are obtained : To introduce the cost slope concept , it is usually assumed that expected all-normal and fully crashed costs are available that is , that CN and Cc ' are known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the expected cost slope Se becomes figure Using the all-normal expected mean time ( taN ) , its variance Vt. ' , and the expected cost slope S. for each activity , network compression proceeds as for CPM calculations . The only difference will again lie in the treatment of the variances . The variance of the expected mean time for an event is computed as before ; however , as compression calculations proceed , previously noncritical paths will become critical , and hence their summed variances become candidates for the event variance . This may lead to sudden increases  | in event variances , notwithstanding the general reduction in magnitude of event expected mean times . In this manner , uncertainty in the various activity chains can be introduced into network compression calculations ; but it is obvious that PERT compression yields indefinite results , indicating only the areas within the project that can be considered for economical and probable compressions . In effect , the overall compression characteristics of the network model are too vague to provide other than an approximate forecast of the time-cost behavior . Compression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it can to a CPll model . In practice , with PERT , compression could be used to provide , at a given point on the network model , qualitative information as to the probably best areas of the project in which to invest additional resources in order to probably regain known or assumed current slippages behind schedule . Of course , only on rare occasions are construction projects encountered that would merit this approach . 12.5 SCHEDULING FOR ALTERNATIVE PLANS WITHIN A NETWORK MODEL In many situations when a network model is being prepared for a construction project it is not known beforehand which of several alternative plans will be adopted for the completion of specific portions of the project . Each of these alternative plans will require specific and possibly different durations , resources , and so on , and the arbitrary selection of one for inclusion in the network model may be misleading . It may be desirable therefore to build into the network model the uncertainty associated with the selection of the alternative plans . In some instances , the selection of one alternative or another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or on the condition that a particular activity has reached a certain stage of completion . In other instances , the selection may be based on a decision to be made at some stage in the project . Initially the final outcome of the decision is unknown , and all that can be said is that this or that outcome has such and such probabilities . As time passes the probability associated with each possible outcome of the decision will change until eventually the final decision is made and one plan is definitely adopted and implemented , all other alternative plans being rejected . It is possible to introduce the uncertainty associated with alternative plans into the network model and the associated calculations for scheduled durations and resources , using probabilistic concepts . If , as is usual , we associate a probability of 1.0 for certainty on a scale ranging from zero to unity , then we can construe the zero probability as representing  | total rejection of an alternative plan , and unit probability as representing the total acceptance or decision to implement a particular alternative plan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and J certain works can be carried out using either plan A in time tA with resources rA or plan B in time tB with resources rB . At the start of the project the probability that plan A is implemented is estimated as PA and that plan B is implemented is estimated as pB . These probabilities will change from time to time until at time T1 , when event I is satisfied , one plan is implemented and the other is rejected . Clearly , one of the probabilities for an alternative plan is now unity and for the other zero . Since plans A and B are mutually exclusive , we have figure It is thus possible to incorporate into the network model one activity .1 , j with duration tij and resources rij which is affected through the probnbility factors PA and pB by both of the alternative plans . In this way by repeatedly updating the probabilities and rerunning the CPAI or PERT computations , it is possible to handle alternative plans , and to have dy-          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
