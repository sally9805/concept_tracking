txt THE MAIL POUCH : THE EAR MUST JUDGE pg . 119 THE MAIL POUCH : THE EAR MUST JUDGE To the Music Editor : I ENTIRELY agree with Harold C. Schonberg 's remarks that it is legitimate to consider music as patterns in sound ; but these pat-7 terns must be apprehended by the ear . It is also legitimate to say , as many composers would say , that it is a function of the composer to train the ears of music listeners to apprehend patterns that they would not have been able to hear before . In this sense every great piece of music enlarges our idea of what music is . Every composer who is able to make us hear music in what we formerly would have thought of as noise , is performing a musical service . I have no doubt that almost everything that Stravinsky ( name any other first rate composer ) wrote sounded good to him ; whereas I believe there are many people writing music who do not give a damn ? if they even know  --  how it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his favorite styles only . Otherwise he will be frustrated by new musical demands ( consonant or dissonant ) and will regard new works as a personal attack on his good taste , as well as an abrogation of the past . Before a critic expresses his likes and dislikes about modern music  --  which he should do ? his contact with it should be active : actual participation , close to its events , places and people . Not opinions from " reliable " friends . Not newspapers or new books on the subject . I mean going to the concerts , reading the scores and keeping up with the latest experiments , even if they seem crazy . This period of modern music is tough on everybody . . . the composer as well as the performer and listener . Atonality and her " sisters " are trying to make a place for themselves and some brilliant hearts ( not just clever minds ) are trying to help them . Criticize these people ? it strengthens them , but understand what they are trying to do . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Where is he ? " MICHAEL COLGRARIL New York . LADY HALLE To the Music Editor : In regard to Mr. Schonberg 's article , " The Distaff Side , " on women as musicians in the nineteenth century , may I call attention to Wilma NormanNeruda ( Lady Halle ) , who was a prominent nineteenth-century violinist . There are numerous references to her in G. B. Shaw 's " London Music " and , of course , she is listed in Grove . WILLIAM SQUIRE . Morgantown , W. Va . THE FAIR SEX To the Music Editor : Maybe Mr. ? Schonberg has found the clue in paralleling the lady musician with the lady composer . Unlike writing and painting , in which women have found success , mathematics and composition require the ultimate in thinking , minus interpersonal relationships . Since the great composer was an innovator , . he must have had enough self-esteem to survive the possible disapproval and lack of recognition in his time , were not strong enough emotionally , or were not trained to endure these disciplines and tensions . Today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of excellent lady composers who , are productive , but who are finding it almost impossible to get performances from the men who stick together . The solution might be for the women to stick logether , accept the differences between the sexes , and not to ' resent being identified as lady musicians . BEATRICE WITKIN New York .

Do n't make In the past , perhaps , women I think it likely that young composers are thrown somewhat off the track by the fact that it is very difficult to get serious and respectful critical attention for a piece of music that sounds good .

There are composers who want to replace the past with " something new . " They are guilty of the faddism , lack of personality and over - intellectualism of which Mr. Schonberg wrote .
