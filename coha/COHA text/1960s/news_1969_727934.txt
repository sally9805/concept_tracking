txt At a meeting disrupted by a student who served a court order on the chairman , the trustees of Long Island University yesterday selected Glenn W. Ferguson , former Ambassador to Kenya , as the university 's new chancellor . The selection was challenged by student leaders who ? less than an hour before  --  had obtained a State Supreme Court order restraining the trustees from making the appointment . When the restraining order was signed in Brooklyn Supreme Court shortly before 4 P.M. by Justice Frank J. Pino , the students rushed to the Century Club at 7 West 43d .. Street. , .. Manhattan , where the trustees were to meet at 4.1 For a while , club employes prevented the students and , their lawyer from entering tol serve the court order on the trustees . But at 4:55 P.M. , a slightly built senior , Peter Wal1 ter , squirmed past a startled attendant , sprinted through the lobby and burst into the room where 16 of the 18 university trustees were seated around a table . Mr. Walter thrust the court papers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seated at the Ir ad of the table , II Mr. , a former City Corporation Counsel , said later that the students ' court order had no effect , since the trustees had voted " 15 or 20 minutes surlier " to appoint Mr. Ferguson . Mr. said the vote was unanimous . Whether the Ferguson appointment was legal remains to be argued at a hearing before Justice Pino next Monday . The students ' attorneys contend the trustees deliberately " ducked " service of the court order while they rushed through the appointment . The court action was instituted by Ronald Berman , president of the Student Government Association at the university 's Brooklyn Center . Mr. Berman , a psychology major , is a junior from Cleveland . He emphasized that the students did not object to Mr. Ferguson personally . He said that , in fact , Mr. Ferguson 's background appeared good . The students ' grievance , Mr. Berman said , was that they had not been consulted in the selection of the new chancellor . Mr. Berman said in the court papers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a solemn promise to Ithe Student Government AssoIciation , the plaintiff , no chancellor or other officer would be appointed without prior consultation with the student organization . The university did not honor his promise . " Legal Steps Stressed Mr. Berman and fellow student leaders who appeared in court stressed that they were using legal procedures because they wanted to avoid the rioting and other violence that have marked student protests on other campuses . " I 'm personally not a radical in the usual sense of the word , " Mr. Berman said . " I would never take any radical action prior to trying the conventional methods . " In an affidavit attached to his application for the court order , Mr. Berman pointed out that the university had revised its statutes earlier this year in the wake of student protests that led to the resignation of the last chancellor , R. Gordon Hoxie . Among other things , he noted , the new statutes provide : " Responsible student bodies must be given the opportunity to convey student concerns and recommendations to those in authority . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than " direct " action of the type that students at Columbia and other universities had used , Mr. Berman replied : " Going to the courts is direct action . " Purposes of Court Action In a formal statement , he said the court action had three purposes : " First , we wish to make clear that we will not be party to this or any future arbitrary appointment of a university official ; particularly in the wake of a new spirit of consultation between students and administrators in colleges across the country , we deem the present actions of the board both an insult and a display of bad faith . " Second , we seek to reaffirm our confidence in the established legal framework for the procurement of what we believe are our rights as students . " And third , we are determined to end the element of backroom politics which continues to color the majority policy decisions of the university . " Mr. Ferguson , who was present at yesterday 's meeting of the trustees , said afterward he had not read the court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
