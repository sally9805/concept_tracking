THE U.S. is a frustrated nation , but not all the blame for that condition attaches to the war in Viet Nam , racial bitterness , campus violence and crime in the streets . Government , business and consumers are deeply troubled by another major source of national tension : the rising pace of inflation . Though the U.S. standard of living is still the highest ever achieved , the value of the nation 's currency is dwindling alarmingly . It has gone down by almost two-thirds in the past 30 years . A 1958 dollar is worth only 790 today , which means that a man must earn 26% more after taxes to buy the same goods . This year the erosion in purchasing power has sharply accelerated . A dollar received as recently as January is worth only 960 now , and at the current rate of price increases will shrink to about 920 by Christmas . <P> Inflation has distorted the entire economy . It has forced the Government to raise taxes , curtail its spending for social programs and reduce the supply of money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their highest levels in a century , spreading turmoil in the financial markets and discomfort in corporate board rooms . Businessmen gloomily foresee a slow year for profits . Consumers , despite their affluence , feel financially strapped and vexed to the point of outrage at the soaring prices they must pay for both the necessities and the luxuries of life . President Nixon says that an attack on inflation is his number one domestic priority . His economists , led by Chairman Paul McCracken of the Council of Economic Advisers , are guiding a delicate effort to control inflation gradually and avoid bringing on the recession that Nixon deeply fears . <P> Last week the battle against inflation entered a new and crucial phase . The phase began when the nation 's commercial banks raised their minimum interest charge for loans from 71% to an unprecedented 81% - a move that was widely interpreted as a portent of a serious credit crisis . The next day , the Government 's top economic policymakers managed to sound downright alarmist as they made a rare joint appearance at a Washington press conference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal and corporate incomes . That tax , which is due to expire June 30 , is designed to fight inflation by reducing demand and increasing the Government 's budget surplus . <P> Red Flags <P> Chairman William McChesney Martin of the Federal Reserve Board warned that without the surtax " we can not succeed " in slowly controlling today 's " critically serious " inflation . Sitting at his side , Treasury Secretary David M. Kennedy* declared : " The problem is much more difficult than I realized . We ca n't let this escalate into runaway inflation , and we 're very close to that now . " If Congress allows the tax to expire , he added , the economy could race far enough out of control to create " the possibility of a serious recession . " To prevent that , Secretary Kennedy warned that the Government would have to consider further budget cuts , tighter money and perhaps , as a last and unwelcome resort , the price and wage controls that the Administration abhors.            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
