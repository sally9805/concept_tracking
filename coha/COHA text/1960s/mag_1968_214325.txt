It was embarrassing , to say the least , when experts predicted that the U.S. basketball team would finish no better than second or third in Mexico City . After all , the game is an American invention , and the U.S. had never failed to bring home a gold medal . It had never even lost a game in Olympic competition ( overall record : 66-0 ) . <P> But this year 's team hardly ranked with the star-studded squads of the past . Notably absent were the top two collegiate players of last season : U.C.L.A. 's Lew Alcindor , who pleaded pressure of studies , and Houston 's Elvin Hayes , who chose to sign a $440,000 contract with the pro San Diego Rockets instead of going to Mexico . The tallest man on the starting five was 6-ft. 8-in . Spencer Hay wood , a 19-year-old sophomore from the University of Detroit . The other starters included a 24-year-old Army captain and a 28-year-old rubber-company foreman . And with only three weeks to prepare for the Olympics , the makeshift U.S. squad hardly seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been playing together ever since the 1964 Olympics . <P> As it turned out , it was the experts who were embarrassed . The man responsible for the red faces was U.S. Coach Hank Iba , 64 , the grand old man of U.S. college basketball from Oklahoma State University . Iba worked so hard at molding his players into a cohesive unit that he lost his voice . They responded by rattling off eight straight victories , including a surprisingly easy 73-58 triumph over Yugoslavia . They also got a big break when the Yugoslavs beat Russia 63-62 in the semifinals-thereby ruling out any confrontation between the U.S. and the favored Russians . <P> In the finals , it was the U.S. against Yugoslavia again , and at halftime the Americans led by the slender margin of three points , 32-29 . Then they cut loose . With young Haywood playing like a dervish , popping in baskets and blocking shots , the U.S. put the game out of reach . By a score of 65-50 , the team that was thought to be the weakest the U.S. had ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basketball .
