Funny thing . Nebraska once again voted-or thought it was voting-its straight-furrowed conservatism even while re-electing Democratic Governor Frank Morrison over Republican Fred Seaton . <P> Seaton wore tailored suits , had spent a lot of time in the effete East-meaning , Washington , D.C.-as Dwight Eisenhower 's Interior Secretary . He came out for a more costly teacher-retirement program , increased funds for the University of Nebraska , a stepped-up highway construction plan . Morrison , a **30;14161;TOOLONG sort of fellow , made fun of the Kennedy Administration , declined to let New Frontier Democrats come into the state to campaign for him , insisted that Seaton 's programs would require a 40% increase in the state 's property tax . Nebraska Republicans decided that Democrat Morrison was more conservative than Seaton . Morrison won easily .
