txt Letters to The Times To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Whenever in gatherings such as the recent meetings of the International Monetary Fund solutions can not be reached , a committee is appointed and the unsolved task is shoved over to it . In the present case , two committees were appointed , and they were ' instructed to study the problem of lack of international liquidity . Editorial Oct. 3 There may not be too much harm done ? if only the two committees had been called upon to study the real problem . When one considers the figures of how much various international institutions can lend out to governments which may be in need of liquid funds , it will be seen that there is money available to cope with any emergency . Our Government has demonstrated this by exercising its drawing rights on the $6 billion fund only to the extent of $500 million and assuring the public that even this amount may not be needed . In the wake of the world wars many countries temporarily lost their credit standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their people succeeded in getting on their feet again . Among them were some less favored by nature and even some poor countries . They have successfully re-established their credit and confidence in their money by reverting to traditional fiscal methods and by restricting the powers of their cred-1 it system to create excessive means of payment . In Role of Borrower We in the United States have been averse , and are averse , to take the hard way . In consequence , the ' richest country of the world , after having reached the top of productive knowledge and capacities , finds itself in the position of having to borrow on short terms from the poorer countries , which only a decade or two ago we were helping to overcome the danger of starvation and misery . We have devbloped the technique of this international borrowing to a remarkable extent , until we seem to have reached the point where we find it difficult , or where at least we resent the necessity of being borrowers on all sides and at all times . We also rightly hesitate to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funds created in the last years with our help , because we resent accepting the terms for these borrowings as they have become usual in such lending operations ( when we were on the creditor side ) . Hence the idea to create another lending institution , which would advance its funds more or less automatically and at terms which we would help to write into its bylaws ( this time conceived from the debtor side ) . At the Washington conferences this was called improving the international liquidity . The normal way to increase a country 's liquidity ( that is , to be able to make international payments exceed international income ) is to use its gold . We have done so in the last decade for purposes both necessary and less so . Now we find ourselves at the limit of using more of our gold , because our short term liabilities have risen beyond the amount of gold left to us . Backing Promises We have supplemented our funds usable for international payments by borrowing dollars , which under our monetary constitution are upon demand repayable in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face value ( $35 equal to one ounce of gold ) until the world has realized that there was not enough gold in our coffers to fulfill these promises without bringing about a world crisis . There is no bad will on the side of the lenders , nor have they been lacking in cooperation up to this point . However , funds lent out by the central ' banks of various countries have the same role as those of private deposit banks ; they are reserves out of which they pay their obligations . Therefore these reserves must be held in instruments of payment , which can be used at all times and in all circumstances for international transfers . Such means of payment of general acceptability have , since an international bank and credit system exist , been gold or currencies which are readily convertible into gold . As doubts in this unlimited convertibility arise , these currencies become less and less usable for their role of reserve currencies . Since the world has learned to fear that claims in dollars may not be readily convertible into gold , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committees will seek a solution has been brought about . Our recently emphasized policy of restrictions of international payments , which tend to make the dollar less usable for international payments and therefore reduce the readiness of foreign central banks to hold increasing dollar amounts for reserve purposes , will not facilitate the work of these committees . There is no problem of international liquidity . There is doubt in the convertibility of the dollar . How confidence- in its convertibility can be restored may be read in the textbooks ( especially in the old ones ) . FREDERICK G. STEINER . New York , Oct. 8 , 1963 . Invitations to Speak Value of Asking Southern Governors to Universities Queried To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : On Sept. 28 under the heading " Governors on Campus " you began an editorial with the sentence , " Free inquiry should be part of the curriculum of every college , North and South . " To this , of course , I say ? Amen , but then deny that the invitations to Governor Barnett at Princeton and Governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intended . These invitations could only serve to build the prestige of Governors badly in need of help . Now they stand irrefutably convicted in the court of conscience , not only of words but deeds contributing directly to the shameful tragedies which disgraced Mississippi and Alabama and our whole cduntry .. The authorities at both universities were right in deploring the invitations but in allowing the right of the students to issue them . The weight of your editorial should have been added to their disapproval of this exercise of student judgment . If , outraged by this apparent approval of the Governors , some students should carry protest into riot , democracy and the good name of the universities would be impaired and the object of violent protest given a martyr 's crown at least in his home state . No wonder both Governors accepted . Fortunately , at Princeton , students , members of the faculty and town folk found a way , without precipitating a violent riot , to express their abhorrence of Governor Barnett 's policies which led to such disgrace to the state and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by other information , this protest was very well handled while Governor Barnett 's right to speak unimpeded was preserved . But without this protest , the whole episode would not have had the effect of holding " repugnant persons and ideas ... up to the light , " which was your declared desire . NORMAN THOMAS New York , Oct. 2 , 1963 . Italian-Americans ' Pride TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TI ES : Relative to the news article published in The Times Oct. 4 entitled " Italian-Americans Here Resent Crime Hearings . " To feel that " the effect of two dozen names mentioned by Valachi " could possibly embarrass " 21,000,000 productive , responsible Americans of Italian descent , who have shown their loyalty for America in peace and war " is inconsistent with the " noble Italian heritage " mentioned . It is indeed absurd for any of these " responsible Americans " to contend that the Kennedy Administration is seeking political advantage from the " grim circus . " We Italian-Americans who can in no way empathize with the gangsterism which may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dilemma of the second generation " should concentrate our efforts on the positive deeds which will , in due time , give ample evidence of the nobility of our heritage . To think there is cause for embarrassment is to question the very nobility of culture that we can so proudly assert . JOSEPH PETER MARTORI . Cambridge , Mass. , Oct. 4 , 1963 .. Origin of Wigorish ' ? To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The word " vigorish , " as a betting term , whose origin you attempted to trace in your Oct. 1 issue , may stem from the Russian word , " vigrosh " which means " winning . " A " vigroshni billet , " for example , means a " winning ticket . " GERSHEN MARINBACH . Brooklyn , Oct. 1 , ' 1963 .
