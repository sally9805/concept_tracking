The hijacking of U.S. airliners for unscheduled trips to Cuba has become so commonplace that a virtually automatic routine has evolved for the prompt release of planes and passengers . The matter was far more serious last week when three well-dressed Arab passengers seized Israel 's El Al Flight 426 an hour out of Rome and forced it to divert its course from Tel Aviv to Algiers . What the Arabs wanted from their skyway robbery was not a free trip but bounty and hostages to use against Israel . <P> One of the hijackers , a swarthy man who had evidently had flying experience , opened the unlocked door to the flight deck , clubbed Copilot Maoz Poraz with the butt of his pistol , and slid into a seat behind Captain Oded Abarbanel , ordering a change of course to Algiers . Back in the cabin , his two accomplices brandished pistols and hand grenades in order to keep the frightened passengers in their seats . <P> When the big Boeing 707 touched down at Algiers ' Dar-el-Beida airport , Algerian authorities impounded the plane . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France on Air Algrie Caravelle jets after treating the detoured travelers well and giving them a sightseeing trip around Algiers . Twelve Israeli passengers and the crew of ten were held along with the plane , possibly as hostages for hundreds of Arab guerrillas currently in Israeli custody , though ten women and children were released at week 's end . The hijackers were quickly identified as Palestinian Arab commandos attached to the Jordan-based Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine . They were equipped with Iranian and Indian passports . <P> Israel at once started dealing through diplomatic channels for the return of the plane , its male Israeli passengers and crew . It may take a while . Algeria formally declared war on Israel a year ago and rejected the cease-fire that ended the six-day Arab-Israeli conflict . Because El Al carried military cargo in the war , Algeria considers it a paramilitary organization . Furthermore , there is local precedent for long detention of unexpected guests . When a private plane carrying former Congolese Premier Moise Tshombe was hijacked to Algiers in June of last year , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months to free the plane . Tshombe himself is still being held . <P> If diplomatic efforts fail , Israeli retaliation seems inevitable . Israel has often mounted punitive raids to redress alleged Arab wrongdoing . Air Algerie flights call regularly at Cairo , which is not far from Israeli airspace . It would be a relatively simple matter for Israeli fighter-interceptors to force one to land at Tel Aviv for use as a bargaining weapon .
