Charles Evans Hughes once went to bed thinking he was President of the U.S. , and woke up to discover that he was just another citizen . Carl Michael Yastrzemski of the Boston Red Sox went to Puerto Rico at the end of the 1967 baseball season , apparently certain of winning unanimous selection as the American League 's Most Valuable Player . And why not ? Outfielder Yastrzemski led the league in batting ( .326 ) and RBls ( 121 ) ; he was tied for the lead in home runs ( 44 ) , and had personally powered the Red Sox-who finished ninth in 1966-to the American League pennant . In the World Series against the St. Louis Cardinals , he hit .400 and clouted three home runs . <P> Last week , when the votes of the Baseball Writers ' Association were counted , Yaz was indeed the Most Valuable Player-but only on 19 out of 20 secret ballots . The other vote went to Cesar Tovar , a utility infielder for the second-place Minnesota Twins who batted .267 , hit six homers and drove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I would have liked it to be unanimous . But I 'm happy to have won . "
