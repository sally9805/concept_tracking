In televisionland , summer comes a little earlier every year . Reruns that used to start appearing in June , now arrive practically in the shadow of the groundhog . Last week no fewer than six series , from CBS 's Gunsmoke to NBC 's Tuesday Night at the Movies , began their long cold summer of repeats . This week six more shows , including ABC 's Garrison 's Gorillas and CBS 's The Lucy Show , break out the old film cans . <P> The explanation is financial , not seasonal . A heavy season of costly specials makes any curtailment of new production an attractive idea . As a result , a " year " for a typical series now lasts 26 weeks . Jackie Gleason , in fact , turned out only 22 in his " season . " He went to reruns on Feb. 17.
