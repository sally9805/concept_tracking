? ? - it ki ? 401. - tr - - Homecoming A Story by Torn Mayer We came up the long rise to the top of the Galisteo shelf at about sixty , which was all the car would do , and then we could see the whole northern end of the Estancia Valley . The steel of the railroad tracks below glinted in the afternoon sun , and we could see the steeple of the church at Lamy behind the roils in the plain . I could tell there was n't much wind , which was unusual , because there were n't any twisters . Sometimes you can see seven or eight separate twisters from the top of the shelf . I was driving and my mother was sitting in the front seat with me. her eyes inflamed and pinkish from a week of crying . I glanced over at her , and / could see her holding herself erect , almost as if she were sitting at attention , but the left corner of her mouth kept twitching , the way it does when she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up on the gas , and the old Hudson began backfiring . " We really ought to trade this thing in , " I said . " It 's gone 106,000 miles and it has a perfect right to blow up anytime . " " It was your father 's car , " my mother said , " and , besides , we do n't have enough money for a new one . We 'll just have to make do . " The part about money was a lie , but I did n't answer , because I did n't want to start an argument with her . I had only been trying to start a conversation . The Galisteo shelf , under one name or another , runs all the way from the Sangre de Cristo Mountains to the Jemez . In the west , on the other side of the Ortiz , it is called La Bajada . At its base is Lamy , the railroad depot for Santa Fe , and , as I said , from the top you can see the whole northern end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from overgrazing and the sun , and it stretches all the way to Texas . I know the northern end of it well , I have ridden over most of it many times , and it became a habit with me to pick out the most important places from the top of the shelf . I do it every time I drive down . We were at the bottom of the grade , almost to the overpass where the road goes over the tracks , when my brother Johnny , who was sitting in back , said , " Do you think it 's gon na rain this afternoon ' ? " He was only thirteen , and my father 's death was very hard on him . " No , " I said . " What makes you think that ? " " There 's some clouds over the Ortiz , so I thought it might rain . " " You know rain never comes from the west , " I said . I was n't mad , just stating a fact . " No , I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Come on now and think of once when it 's rained from the west . " Johnny thought for a minute . Then he said , " I guess I ca n't . " " Damn right you ca n't , " I said . " You know rain clouds always start from the Sangres . " " Do n't pick on Johnny like that , " my mother said . " He did n't mean anything . " " I know . " " Well then why were you picking on him ? He did n't do anything . " " / was n't picking on him , " I said . " You were too . " " Oh for Chrissake , " I said . " I was not . " Mother started to cry . " Shut up , will you , Mother ? " I said . " You 've done nothing but cry all week . " Of course that only made her cry all the more , so after a minute I said , " Mother , I 'm sorry . I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That calmed her down a little bit , but I did n't look over at her , because I knew the corner of her mouth would be twitching . Iturned left toward Lamy just before the overpass . When we got to town I parked behind the station . Lamy is a very small town . It has an old adobe church , a few adobe houses , mostly unplastered and crumbling , the station , a general store , a Gulf filling station , the Pink Garter saloon , and five or six of those yellow-board railroad shacks , There are yellow shacks like those in every town along the Santa Fe , and the railroad even paints A T &; SF on some of them . There was a redcap sitting on one of the baggage carts when I got out , and he said , " You need help ? " " Yeah , " I said . " I got ta coffin coming in on the baggage car . " " Which train ? " " Eastbound Chief . " " O.K. " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Westbound comes through at four was why I asked . " " Fine , " I said . It was five past three by my watch and I walked around to the platform . There were a couple of people I had never seen before and Donal McNally . Donal McNally was my father 's best friend , and whenever anything went wrong we knew we could count on Donal . He and my father had been in the Australian army together in the first world war , and my father brought Donal out to New Mexico to work on his ranch . Donal did n't stay on the ranch , but got into political writing , and now he is syndicated in sixteen newspapers . Sometimes we did n't see Donal for a long time , but whenever anything went wrong we could always count on him . " Hello Jerry , " he said . " Hello , " I said . Johnny came walking over and Donal ruffled his hair . Donal is a big man , getting fat , and Johnny hardly came to his waist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mortuary ? " Donal asked . " Hudson , I guess . " I had n't really thought about it . " It might be a tight fit . I got to thinking about that so I hired a hearse to take it up in for you . Also it might upset your mother pretty bad if she had to ride all the way back with it in the car . " " You 're right about it upsetting her , " 1 said . " And about the rest of it , too . Where did you park the hearse ? " I had n't seen it when we drove in . " Over at the filling station . Driver had to get some gas . " " Thank you very much , " I said , " for thinking of it . " " That 's all right . . .. How is she ? " " Mother 7 " " Yes . " " Pretty shaky , I guess . She 's been crying a lot . " " She 's upset . " " I know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " Tom Mayer , who comes from Santa Fe , New Mexico , wilt be a junior at Harvard this fall . He is the winner of the 1962 College Short Story Contest Award of " Story Magazine . " JO HOMECOMING No you ca n't . " " Johnny , " he said . " Come on . Let 's go cheer up your Mommy . " They walked off and left me standing by myself . Donal had his hand on Johnny 's head . I looked down at the overpass , and the semaphore was down and the signal light red . You can see the overpass , which is several miles away , from the platform , though at the eastern end of the station the tracks twist off out of sight into the Glorieta Canyon . 0 n an impulse I started to walk one of the rails . I was out of practice , but I did n't slip too much . I learned to walk rails when I was five or six . Whenever we 'd load sheep , my father would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very touchy business , and he did n't want to have a little boy around to spook the animals . You got to have a goat to lead them up the ramp , and if you panic them they bunch up and crush each other . You lose 2 per cent to crushing anyway , but no more if you are careful . My father was a very careful loader and he did n't want to take chances by having me around . " Jerry , " he used to say , " why do n't you go down and practice rail-walking ? I 'll come down later and we 'll have a contest . Be sure you stay on the siding and do n't get on the main line . " Sometimes I would have to practice rail-walking by myself for three or four hours or even half a day while the borregueros and my father loaded . Loading is dirty work , but no matter how tired he was my father would always have a rail-walking contest with me after he was finished . He would be covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually beat me . By the time I was eight , though , I stopped walking rails and learned to use a sheep counter . Not that it was hard work , but it is very important . Later I learned to help with the herding itself , and then I would be tireder and dirtier than my father when we finished . When we were loading animals from the Peele place , a ranch my father bought in the ' twenties , we used the Lamy pens , which are on the other side of the overpass from the station . The sheep from the old Torreon ranch , which belonged to my great-grandfather , we loaded at Vaughn on the southern route of the Santa Fe . We sold the Peele place after my father had his first heart attack three years ago , but I imagine we 'll bold onto the Torreon as long as we can . I slipped off the rail once and turned around to come back . I guess thinking about loading , and the rail-walking , had started me off , becauseremembered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harvey House at Lamy . They tore the Harvey House down in the summer of 1950 and this was the winter before . The Harvey House was a big California-Spanish hotel like the ones in Gallup and Flagstaff , and they tore it down because nobody even used the dining room any more . My father told me that in the old days when he was a kid it was a very swanky place . There were lace vines growing all over the archways , and in the courtyard was a goldfish pond . Except for stock tanks , that goldfish pond was the only pond I saw until I was seven or eight . I remembered I 'd always wanted to go wading in it and try to catch a goldfish . We stopped there often coming home from the Torreon . We have always lived in Santa Fe in my mother 's house as well as on the Torreon . Her father was a Supreme Court justice , and we kept the house in Santa Fe partly so that Johnny and I could go to school in town , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ranch all year round . When we stopped at the Harvey House in winter we would sit around in front of the big fireplace in the lobby and drink hot chocolate , and if it was summer we would go into the bar . The bar was very dark and cool , and my parents would have Tom Collinses while I drank ginger ale . The time that Dinah had puppies we were driving north on a very cold day . It was snowing a little , and the wind was blowing so strong it swayed even the heavy Hudson . My parents and I were sitting in the front seat , and Old Mike and Dinah , my father 's Airedales , were in back . My father had kept Airedales ever since the ' thirties when he ran sheep in the Jemez summers and needed bear dogs . Old Mike had been a bear dog , and one of his ears was missing . Dinah had been whimpering for quite a while , and my mother said she thought maybe her time was coming . Suddenly Dinah snarled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old Mike did n't make a sound . My mother turned around and said , " Oh my God , Ned . She 's whelping . " Sure enough Dinah had Old Mike 's shoulder clenched in her teeth and the first pup was about halfway out . My father said , " Jesus H. Christ , " which is what he always said when he was annoyed , and stopped the car . He got out and got into the back seat . Very carefully he pried Dinah 's teeth loose , and then he snapped his fingers so that Old Mike jumped over into the front seat with us . His shoulder was bleeding a lot , and my father said , " Jerry , take this handkerchief and hold it on Old Mike 's shout-der to stop the bleeding . You drive , Agnes . I 'll stay back here . " Dinah snarled again , but my father petted her , and she quieted down . He was wonderful with all kinds of animals . My mother said . " We ca n't drive all the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I know , " my father said . " We 'll stop at Lamy . " We were only about five miles from Lamy and we drove on in with me holding the handkerchief on Old Mike 's shoulder , and my father in the back seat petting Dinah . My father was the only one who said anything , and he talked to Dinah . " Easy little girl , " he said . " Easy darlin ' little girl . Everythin 's all right and nothin 's gon na hurt my darlin ' little girl so easy little girl easy . " Dinah lay down on her side and put her head in my father 's lap . When she had finished with the first pup my father leaned across her very carefully and cut the cord with his pocket knife . He sterilized the knife every morning , because sometimes he had to puncture bloated sheep with it . If a lot of sheep are badly bloated you do n't have time to give them all bloat medicine , so you puncture their stomachs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that happened . He took the pup in his hand and said , " It 's dead . She must have crushed it . " Then he put the dead pup on the floor and kept talking to Dinah . When we got to Lamy my father said . " Stop in front of the Harvey House . " He picked Dinah up and carried her into the hotel . The clerk was a young man named Silvo Torres . His father was old Reginaldo , one of our best borregiteros , and Silvo had been born on the Torreon . He saw the situation right away and he said to my father in Spanish , " Take her over by the fireplace . I 'll get some blankets . " There was a big Navaho rug in front of the fireplace , and my father sat down on it with Dinah , Just then she whined , and cried , and the second pup had started . Silvo came back with the blankets , and my father covered her with them . The second pup took about fifteen minutes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rat  --  Airedales are ugly puppies until they are almost a month old  --  and my mother put it in her sheepskin to keep it warm . Old Mike and I sat away at a respectful distance and watched . Dinah had five more pups in three hours . At one point a lady in a fur coat came in to wait for her train , and , when she saw what was going on , she said , " Oh how repulsive . " My father did n't look up , but my mother was mad . I could tell because her cheeks got red . Old Mike snarled at the lady . She waited for a minute or two and then she went out . A story by Tom Mayer 91 Silvo fixed up a whelping box from old boards , and brought it in . My father put Dinah in it with the pups , and covered them with blankets . We stayed at the Harvey House overnight , and Old Mike slept in my room . We were probably its last guests . The next morning we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slipped off the rail again , while I was trying to turn around , and I looked at my watch . Three fifteen . I went over and sat on a baggage cart in the shade . I looked toward the east end of the station where the Glorieta Canyon starts . The only important train I 'd ever met before was a westbound . That was when Mother came back from Chicago after she had my little sister Janet , who died when she was less than a year old . All of us were cesareans , and my mother went to Chicago because she did n't have much confidence in the local hospital . Janet was born December sixth , and my mother came home Christmas afternoon on the Super Chief . My father and I met them . My father brought half-a-dozen roses down to the train , and I remember he looked a little funny standing there on the platform in his dirty old ranch sheepskin holding half-a-dozen roses . The train was late arid both my father and I thought we heard it several times before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ track , which was very cold , to listen . When the train did come , my mother was the only person who got off . She was carrying Janet in her arms , and she cried when she saw the roses . She let me hold Janet while she kissed my father , and she cried some more . Thinking about her standing there crying , heard the whistle of the train . I looked toward the overpass , and I could see the headlight of the diesel . Donal came up , and I jumped off the baggage cart . " Where 's the redcap ? " he asked . I looked around and saw the redcap pulling another cart up toward where the baggage car would stop . " There , " I said , and pointed . Donal and started after him . I turned to watch the train come by . I love to watch the big five-unit diesels the Santa Fe uses , and usually I wave to the engineer . That day , though , I thought I probably should n't . The engine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't going very fast , and the baggage car 92 HOMECOMING stopped exactly in front of the redcap . The door of it opened and the brakeman lifted two mail sacks onto the cart . " Got a coffin ? " asked the redcap . " Yes , " the brakeman said . " As a matter of fact I 've got three . Phelps , Huevelle , and Gordon . " The redcap looked at me . " Gordon , " I said . " Edmund Gordon . " The brakeman said , " Your father ? " " Yes . He died of a heart attack . At a stock growers ' convention in San Francisco . " " I 'm sorry . " " Thanks . He 's had a bad heart for a long time . " The redcap climbed into the car and they slid the coffin onto the cart . Donal looked at the tag and said . " This is the one . " Then he put his arm around my shoulders for a moment . The redcap pulled the cart away down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the station . " Take it over to the hearse , " Donal said . A Cadillac hearse was pulled up by the buses . Donal turned to me . " I 'll tip him . You get your mother on home . This is awfully hard on her , and she needs you . She needs you and rest . I 'll look after everything at the mortuary ; you just get your mother on home . " " Thank you very much for everything , " I said . He put his hand on my shoulder again , and walked off after the redcap . Johnny was crying when we got in the car , though my mother had stopped . " Should n't we look inside and see if it 's Daddy ? " Johnny asked . Mother smiled . It was the first time she had smiled all week . Johnny was sitting in front with us this time , and she put her arms around him . " No Johnny , we ca n't look inside . Not here . I wanted to too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't do any good to look . " " Why not ? " Johnny asked . " I do n't know , " my mother said . " It just would n't do any good . " I was afraid she was going to start crying again , so I said , " Donal 's going to ride up to the mortuary with the coffin . It 'll be better that way . " " I know , " my mother said . " He told me he was . It 's very nice of him . " I backed the car out as the hearse pulled around us . I let the clutch in , and the motor almost died . It backfired loudly , and I said , " Jesus H. Christ . " I said it again . " Jesus H. Christ . " I felt like slamming my fist into the dashboard as hard as I could , but the motor caught and I put the car in second gear . - - -              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
