Harry Jackson is a stocky man of 36 who sports a beatnik beard , wears a handsome pair of cowboy boots , and is just about as restless as an artist can be . Ten years ago he was hailed as one of the most promising newcomers to the New York school of abstract expressionism . But last week he had on display at Manhattan 's Knoedler Gallery a series of brilliant little bronzes of cowboys and cattle , proving himself an apt pupil at an older school , that of Frederic Remington . <P> As a boy growing up in Chicago , Jackson had two passions : drawing and horses . A headache to his truant officer , he decided at 14 to skip town altogether . He had heard of a romantic place called Cody , Wyoming , and without even a word to his mother , he headed west . <P> At Cody , he recalls , he " saddled horses for dudes , slopped hogs , and generally did n't do anything romantic . " In World War II , he joined the Marines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Saipan . By the time he got home , his non-reconnaissance " war painting " had begun to attract attention . <P> It was in New York , where he began studying art under the G.I. bill , that Jackson underwent his first transformation . " It was just bad luck that I did n't run into any realist painters like Hopper , " says he , " for all I could see in realism was dried-up old people worried about whether there were fingerprints on their canvases . " He fell " like crazy " for Jackson Pollock . He studied with Mexico 's gentle Rufino Tamayo ( " He never taught you anything , but at least he left you alone " ) , came to know De Kooning , the new panjandrum of action painting , and for a while was married to Grace Hartigan , one of the lady prophets of abstract expressionism . Then , in 1954 , Harry Jackson suddenly stopped painting abstractions and set off for Europe to copy the old masters . " I wanted to get back to my old point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to bring to the old way the freedom I 'd been given . That 's the artist 's secret , you know : to put that freedom into forms anyone can recognize . " In his bronzes , Jackson found what he was looking for . <P> His cowboys battle a thundering stampede , sing their long ballads , rope their steers , and , in solemn ritual , bury a friend under the big sky . They manage to combine power and tenderness . " I like taking something the movies and TV screwed up , " says Jackson . " I like taking something they have made saccharine and make it real again . "
