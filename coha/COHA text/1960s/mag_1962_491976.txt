Europe is in the chips . An affluence undreamed of a few years ago is filling European pockets with hard cash , European kitchens with new gadgets , and European highways with new cars . Rooftops have sprouted forests of antennas . Luxurious jet planes ferry busy men and women across the Alps , across the Rhine . People who used to ride the streetcar now drive to work . The stores are crammed with great quantities of the good things in life . Three hundred million human beings  --  the inhabitants of Europe on the sunny side of the Iron Curtain  --  arc enjoying a prosperity that is unprecedented in the Old World 's history . Postwar reports of Europe 's demise have since proved premature . That it was a narrow squeeze nobody here denies . " l 1 we are still around at all , " a ranking French official said , " it is most likely due to the forty-odd billion aid dollars the United States has lent or given Europe since the end of World War I I. But we are now on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered a new phase , and we are moving forward on our own momentum . " In my own little world , the nook of Paris where I make my home , things have crept up on me . Since when , 1 wonder , has Monsieur Louis N , ho owns the bistro down the way  --  a favorite haunt of truck drivers and workmen  --  used an expensive station wagon for his marketing ? The television antenna marring the view from my back window dates back  --  let 's see  --  to last July . 1 seem to have a neighbor who gives cocktail parties . An expensive-looking candy store has recently opened its doors . The toy shop has taken on an extra salesgirl and put out a neon sign . The bank has had its face lifted . My friend the antique dealer and his wife spent their summer vacation driving all the way to the North Cape and back again . The man who runs the inn around the corner has bought the rickety apartment house adjoining his property and plans to do it over . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and take his wife al id little boy off to the country every fair weekend .

Project this picture post card on a vaster screen and what you get is Europe , 1962 . While the United States has passed through at least two recessions since the Korean War , Europe has suffered nothing worse than a couple of mild dips . And while we have increased our national ? . vealth since 1950 at the modest rate of 3.8 per cent a year , France 's annual rate of growth has averaged 7.1 percent ; Italy 's 8.4 percent ; and finally , Western Germany 's , a staggering 9.6 percent . The rise from rags to riches , to be sure , must be seen H1 its proper perspective . In several European countries expansion has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during World War 11 . Starting at the bottom , they came up fast , while our own economy was merely clambering from an already high plateau to a still higher one . Even today the average European is still " poor " by our standards , his annual income being roughly half the income of the average American in terms of real purchasing power . Moreover there remain some ugly holes in the bright picture of Europe 's new prosperity . Greece , Portugal , Southern Italy and parts of Spain are still beset by their old incubus , mass poverty . Slums , even cave dwellings , exist in many cities . There are regions where such necessities of life as electricity and running water are still considered luxuries . Even in Britain , WesteiTi Germany and France the electricity output per person is less than half our own . Housing , almost everywhere in Europe , is still distressingly inadequate , with many families living in one small room or sharing the homes of relatives . Last but not least , the distribution of wealth still leaves a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard beneath the glittering surface . Still , the great bulk of Western Europe 's population is now immeasurably better off than in the recent past . Wages have gone up steeply in the last five years , and full employment has become a fact in almost every European country . In some industrial regions , such as the thriving Netherlands , there now are many more jobs than men to fill them . Switzerland , with a population of 5,000,000 , employs as many as 500,000 foreign workers , most of them imported from Southern Italy and Spain . Western Germany has 750,000 registered job openings ; and although wages there already are 13 percent higher than they were last year , a skilled man is worth almost any wage he asks for in what is known as the " g-ray labor market . " Labor piracy has become a common practice in places like the Ruhr and Lombardy , where specialists are being lured from one job to another by pleading , desperate employers . A static continent has turned dynamic . Cities have outgrown their old forms and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ European capital from the air , and you will see its venerable body dwarfed by a brood of modern suburbs . ) The birth rate has been climbing merrily since World ' War II  --  even old France , stagnant and over-age for decades , has spawned some record crops of babies , increasing her population from a prewar 42,000,000 to 45,800,001 ) . The accent is on youth . Everywhere one goes in Western Europe one is impressed with the great number of young people , taller than their elders , and by the flocks of boisterously healthy children , dressed no longer like tiny adults but in dungarees and T shirts . People are on the move . Farmers flock to the cities . Townsfolk become suburbanites . Touched by a magic wand , the great outdoors has come to life  --  long-silent forests swarm with campers , the lakes are white with sailboats , gingerbread mountain towns are packed with skiers . Anything that spells " hobby " and " outdoors " ? from barbecue grills to records , stamps and movie cameras  --  is selling briskly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it circulates . The most remarkable thing about this new prosperity in a notoriously class-ridden continent is that it is a mass phenomenon . " Exclusive " signs are coming down all over Europe . " I went to Capri last summer as I do every year , " an Italian industrialist told me . " The first day on the island I met our maid with her husband . The next day I encountered my optician . And the day after that I bumped into my tailor , who promptly measured me for a new suit . " The common man at last has come into his own , and he behaves surprisingly like his transatlantic relative , who took off in pursuit of happiness a generation or two earlier . Not that the American design for living is taken over wholesale , with no questions asked . I have yet to meet a Frenchman who believes that canned food is as good to eat as fresh food , or an Italian woman who 'd consider herself as elegant in a ready-made dress as in one made to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ younger set  --  find a generous amount of " Americanization " wholly compatible with their own way of life . If supermarkets have begun to flourish in many European cities  --  France has nearly 100 of them and expects to build 3000 in the next four years  --  it is because more women work and can no longer spare the time to gossip with the butcher , the grocer and the pastry baker . If quick-lunch counters are besieged at midday by a throng of workers and employees , it is because more and more businesses are switching to the continuous working day , replacing the hallowed institution of the three-hour lunch with a quick break . Vending machines and jukeboxes have become part of Europe 's scenery , along with plastics and synthetic fabrics , slacks for the ladies , frozen food , soft drinks and tranquilizer pills . As customers have become more demanding , stores everywhere have " gone American " in their display and marketing techniques . Gift-wrapping , recently introduced in France , has been a huge success . One large Paris department store sends its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see what she can glean about American merchandising and display techniques . Discount stores have begun to operate in several cities . Consumer credit , virtually unknown in many European countries before World War II , has been accepted , albeit cautiously , as a necessary feature of the market place . The average Englishman today owes $33 in installment debts on goods he has bought ; the German , $22 ; and the Frenchman , $16 ? compared . with 5212 owed by the average American . But it is the motorcar  --  catalyst of our own machine-age civilization  --  that has revolutionized the European way of life . Consider for a moment the case of France 's celebrated ugly duckling , the 51000 Deux Chevaux  --  an air-cooled frill-less four-door sedan that looks like two bicycles joined together by a piece of dirty canvas . Designed to lit the worker 's pocketbook , it came into the world as the direct result of social agitation in the 1930 's  --  a child of France 's " Popular Front . " " There was talk of paid vacations and weekend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Citroen works in Paris told me . " Our Deux Chevaux  --  vas meant to be the answer . Some of our people had been to America and studied mass-production methods at the Ford plant , and we were ready with a prototype when World War II broke out . Well , you should have heard the cries of horror when we unveiled the model at long last at the 1948 Automobile Salon . is that a car ? ' people were asking . it was so ugly ! Of course , it was designed by engineers and not by aesthetes . When people found it worked , they bought it . " A journey around France will turn up quite a few of the 1,500,000 little rattle-traps sold until now . Country priests chug around their parishes in them . Veterinarians find them just the thing for taking off across rough fields . Postmen drive them on their appointed rounds . In town , the plumber and the electrician who until recently rode bicycles now call on you in their own Deux Che%'aux . Shopkeepers use them for deliveries on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family . The Deux Cheraux 's success story is by no means unique . It is matched if not excelled by those of Fiat 's Topolino and " 600 " and of the German Volk.swagen , now turned out at the rate of nearly 1,000,000 a year . True , Europe is still well behind us in mobility  --  where there is one passenger car for every three Americans , there still is only one for every eight Frenchmen , every nine Britons , every eleven West Germans , every twenty-six Italians and every 200 Greeks ! However , Western Europe 's total number of automobiles has jumped from some 10,000,000 in 1950 to more than 30,000,000 ; Italy alone has multiplied her herd of passenger cars by six in the same period . An Italian friend of mine who works for a government agency in Rome reports : " ln 1958 only one man besides me owned a car in my department . Today nine other people drive their own automobiles , including two girl secretaries and one of the ushers . " As thousands of Europeans graduate every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheels , others move up to more expensive makes . Easy credit terms and a snow-balling secondhand-car market extend , from year to year , the boundaries of ownership . The old clich ? that " Europe could always export parking space for dollars " has long since lost its point . Parking your car in Vienna , Stockholm or Milan is as traumatic an experience as it is in Manhattan . To make things Nvorse , many a lovely European city was laid out centuries ago and has retained such quaintly medieval features as narrow crooked streets that intersect at crazy angles . Some cities , like eternal Rome , are girded by historic walls that city planners can not touch , and motorists must squeeze through narrow gates  --  designed , likely as not. , by Michelangelo . The resulting traffic jam , as every tourist knows , is something to write home about . Cooped up in his own bailiwick for many war and postwar years , the European yields to the exhilarating rush of a new freedom . Along hurriedly widened roads and brand-new superhighways , past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , through recently completed Alpine tunnels , he rumbles off to see the world . For the first time in history millions of Europeans cross their own borders and take a look at foreign lands which heretofore were well beyond their reach . Paris in springtime is overrun with Germans . Spain , Italy and Greece become , during the summer months , the happy hunting grounds of Frenchmen , Belgians , Germans , Britons , Scandinavians . An air ferry will fly your car from continental Europe to the British Isles and vice versa ; luxurious trains will carry United States you now have 105 TV sets for every 100 households , while Western Europe has no more than thirty-six . Or take refrigerators-120 to 100 homes in the United States , and just twenty-seven to 11 ) 0 over here . " He glanced up from his papers . " You 've come from Paris ?

" Under the impact of the roaring ' 60 's the map @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Middle Ages , when townsmen built great castles and cathedrals and soon achieved ascendancy over less-enterprising neighbors . Among the hitching posts of the new boom are Rotterdam . with its vast " Europort " . Zurich , which now plays banker to a large segment of the continent ; Milan , the commercial capital of Italy ; Turin , whose baroque palaces and churches are now eclipsed by the huge Fiat works ; and Dusseldorf ? " desk of the Ruhr . " It is in Diisseldorf that one receives perhaps the most impressive notion of what this age of affluence is all about . Fed by the mines and factories of the nearby Ruhr , whose corporations use it as a headquarters , the city  --  once a third-rate ducal residence  --  has turned into Exhibit A of what is known as the West German " miracle . " Those of us who came through here at the end of World War 11 , when 65 percent of the city 's built-up area was flattened , have trouble recognizing it . Wide , pleasant avenues , lined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the ruins of cramped quarters . Eleven junior skyscrapers have been completed or are being built seventeen more are planned . Diisseldorf has made itself the principal emporium for ladies ' coats and dresses on the continent ; it boasts a " supermarket " for used cars . its stock exchange is now the continent 's largest after Paris ; its streetcars serve refreshments . Almost everyone you see wears new , expensive clothes . The number of privately owned automobiles has more than doubled in the last live years . Along the chestnut-lined kOnigsallee , where swans float lazily in the canal that runs its length . shop windows overflow with all the attributes of the abundant life . From jewelry to hand-tooled leather goods , from furs and stylish shoes to chinaware and fancy chocolates . the German wage earner finds all his heart desires . Bank %vindows show on electronically operated boards the fluctuations of his favorite blue-chip stocks . In flower-trimmed sidewalk cafes . housewives arc apt to discuss , over ice cream and cake , the servant shortage or their Mediterranean cruise .

We Germans are hard-working people , we 've had to work extra hard this time to prove to Russia and her prisoners behind the Iron Curtain that life is hotter here there is freedom . " He drained his beaker while I waited for the rest which never came : We had to prove it also to ourselves . Beneath the surface ripples of Europe 's golden age , one finds some basic changes which are beginning to affect the structure of society itself . Class hatred , for one thing , is disappearing fast as today 's have-nots expect to be tomorrow 's haves . A Fiat automobile representative with whom 1 talked in a small town in Italy smilingly pointed to a poster in his office . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blonde in slacks , a bronzed young man with golf clubs , and other stand-bys of the advertising trade  --  grouped casually around Fiat 's latest ranch wagon on the luxurious lawn of a suburban house . " Ten years ago , " the dealer said , " we would not have dared put up a thing like that . A poster of this kind would have caused nothing but resentment . Today every Italian can visualize himself  --  or at any rate his children  --  as members of that happy group . " But Old World capitalism itself has come of age and is no longer the terrifying bogey it used to be . Gone is the penny-pinching , still-necked , ice-cold manufacturer who ran the business by his own lights , brooking no interference . in his place there has risen a managerial elite very much like our own .

Many of Europe 's manufacturers and merchants have in fact visited the United States . Others have listened to our industrial experts sent to Europe under various technical-assistance schemes . Scoffing at the old concept of a high per-unit profit based on limited production , these trained professionals are out full tilt for productivity and an expanding market . Far from L L exploiting " those who work for them , they look at them as customers who must be able to afford what their own hands turn out . Nothing could have shown more clearly the way the wind is blowing than the recent free distribution by France 's giant Pechiney chemical company of 35,000 shares of its own stock  --  worth about sixty dollars each  --  among its employees . Karl Marx , one ca n't help thinking , would have been somewhat shaken had he been still around . Will Europe stay her course ' ?

Moreover , the Common Market  --  a solemn compact among European nations to scrap the trade harriers still separating them  --  is well out of the blueprint stage . As economic unity becomes a fact , as goods and people start to move across the map as freely as they do in the United States , the future holds the promise of an even more broadly based prosperity . The signs at this point read FULL SPEED AHEAD . Barring such unforeseeable calamities as war and coups d ' ? tat , the experts say that ten or twelve years hence are now . Picking and choosing as they go along , acceptample according to their needs and fancy , they will no doubt come up with their own version of the affluent our European cousins should he as prosperous as we ing or rejecting various aspects of the American exsociety .
