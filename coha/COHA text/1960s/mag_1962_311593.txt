A Gift of Time ( by Garson Kanin ) is the sad , clinically harrowing story of a man who is dying of cancer of the lower bowel , and how he faces it during the last three months of his life in Southern France . The Broadway play is based on Death of a Man , Lael Tucker Wertenbaker 's account of her husband 's suicide . Charles Christian Wertenbaker was an able journalist ( for FORTUNE , LIFE , and TIME from 1931 to 1948 ) turned novelist . Gift is strangely unmoving and dramatically slack , partly because the audience knows in advance that the hero will die , partly because it never gets to know and care about the man himself , and partly because he opts for suicide as a way out before he even struggles with the un bearable pain that might have purged and shaken the playgoer with pity and terror . <P> Wertenbaker ( Henry Fonda ) becomes a self-dramatizing romantic , and an intellectual hedonist with a somewhat arrogant presumption about accepting life or death on any but his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is his sole belief , and when he drinks the hemlock of approaching death , it must be like an " exquisite brandy . " His , and the play 's , point of view is that man is essentially a good animal , and when he sees himself becoming a bad , i.e. maimed , animal , he may admirably put an end to himself . <P> Apart from the overtones of demi-semi-Hemingway in this creed , the play casts doubt on the joy of life that it rather self-consciously preaches ( " use all five senses every day " ) . To treat life as a branch of esthetics is to observe one 's responses to it , rather than engage spontaneously in it , to play-act rather than act , or play . When Wertenbaker and his wife Lael ( Olivia de Havilland ) make love , he asks for a morning-after review . " Miraculous , as always , " she replies , making two people who believe it . <P> From scene to scene , Henry Fonda visibly erodes with stoic dignity . A trifle over-animated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But as the play empties into the bowl over which the hero slits his wrists , it seems to leave behind it no revelation , only a stubborn ring of illusions.
