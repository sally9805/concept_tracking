Both committees called for ( prekindergartenpro-rams , but the state group urged that primary schools go through the fourth grade , with middle schools to be created for the fifth through eighth grades , replacing junior high schools . The , city committee recommended prekindergarten as the " keystone " of an early-childhood program going through the second grade . Grades three to six , the committee said , I would constitute a reorganized " middle - grade program " but would still be part of the elementary schools .
