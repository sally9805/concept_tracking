In most places , the town-meeting style of democracy has long since gone the way of the cucking stool . Its heritage is the referendum , an instant , pain less substitute that leaves discussion of controversial issues to the press and their resolution to the curtained conscience of the voter . Sometimes the issues attract as much attention as the candidates , but more often they are so trivial-or so confusing-that they should never have been put on the ballot at all . Last week 's election had a few of both kinds . <P> In defiance of all pollsters ' predictions , Californians , by a 3-to-2 margin , voted against the CLEAN initiative ( named for its sponsor , the California League Enlisting Action Now ) , which would have re-enforced police powers to ban pornographic literature-and , said opponents , would have outlawed just about half of a ten-year-old 's reading list . A few voters may have been confused by the question 's wording , which required CLEAN supporters to vote for an " Obscenity Initiative . " Now who would vote for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heated issue concerned the fate of Mayor John Lindsay 's civilian-dominated police review board , set up last summer to hear and sift charges of police malfeasance or brutality . Most top politicians of both parties campaigned for the board . The police bitterly opposed it , and the majority ( 63% ) of voters agreed that the board would inhibit the cop on the beat and send the crime rate soaring . The board was summarily killed . <P> Taking from Caesar . Many voters saw in legalized gambling a fiscal panacea whereby they would not only have to render less unto Caesar but also-with luck-Caesar might render something unto them . In New York , a state lottery for the support of education received overwhelming endorsement , while in New Jersey , night harness racing was approved , opening the track-and the heavily taxed parimutuel windows-to many people who could not make it in the daytime . <P> Far too many of the issues merely cluttered up the ballot . In one of the oddest measures to appear on any ballot , the citizens of Dearborn , Mich. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nam . A majority-56.5%-gravely declared against unilateral withdrawal .
