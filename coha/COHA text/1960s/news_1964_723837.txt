" " Violent Miscarriage of Justice " " A violent miscarriage of justice . " said Assistant Defense Atty . Joe H. Tonahill , " I am about to throw up . " Belli said Ruby did not say a word . " I think he did n't get the full import of it . " Mrs. Margaret Oswald , mother of the slain Marxist , appeared at the courthouse during the trial and was subpenaed - but never called  --  as a witness . The subpena silenced the outspoken Mrs. Oswald during the trial . But this morning , shortly after the jurors passed near her on their way from breakfast to deliberate . Mrs. Oswald told reporters she hoped they sentenced Ruby to life imprisonment without parole . " Verdict of Law . Not Men " District Atty . Wade said it was a verdict of " our government and law rather than men . . . not guilty would have put our civilization back to barbarianism . " In final arguments , he asked the jurors to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Wade added , in a press conference . " I am very well satisfied with it . I think it was a proper verdict . I did n't think acquittal or a term of years was the proper verdict . " The defense based its entire case on the question of Ruby 's sanity . " They did n't make a very good case of it and did n't ask for leniency or mercy , " Wade said . Asked what the significance of the quick verdict was , Wade said , " I do n't think it was significant of anything except that the jury had made up its mind by the evidence that he was n't insane . " " The testimony that gave him the electric chair was that of policemen showing premeditation , " W .. de said , " his slipping a loaded gun into the police station . " Ruby , who never took the stand in his own defense , was quoted by policemen during and after the slaying of Oswald as saying : ... " You rat ............ ! You killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I meant to shoot him three times ! " Belli , volatile " king of torts " from San Francisco , began shouting his wrath to the press immediately after the jury left the courtroom . He said he was going to appeal at once ? " today . " He planned to confer with Ruby in jail , The scene grew so intense that at 12:30 p. m . Judge Brown wandered in without his robe and said : " Get those television cameras out of here or I am going to throw them re . " He then ordered the entire courtroom cleared . Belli told reporters : " May I thank this jury for a victory and assure each of these jurors that we 'll appeal this and take it out of Dallas . " His voice rising , he added : " Now , do you believe there is justice ? And that there 's an oligarchy in Dallas ? " Do you believe this is a part of the United States ? " You people the press have been here five weeks looking at a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " City of Shame " " Dallas is a city of shame forevermore . " " This is one of the sore spots of America , and if this venom spreads thru the whole country , God help us all . " " The festering sore that is Dallas now announces itself as the most shocking thing I have ever seen in my life . " This jury was n't concerned with listening to us . " The verdict left unblemished Wade 's record of convictions in capital cases . It was the 24th time he has obtained a maximum penalty in a murder with malice trial . It was the climax of months of legal maneuvering . Denies Change of Venue The trial began Feb. 17 after a week-long hearing on a defense motion for a change of venue to another Texas city . Attorneys for Ruby contended he could not receive a fair trial in Dallas because of widespread publicity and sentiment in the city so recently shocked by the assassination of President Kennedy on Nov. 22 , just two days before Oswald was killed .

The prosecution got Gibbs to admit under cross-examination that he had no opinion as to the sanity of Ruby at the time of the killing . Later , prosecutors referred to the doctor as " the great Gibbs . " Court stood in recess for most of the day while the defense argued 41 objections to points in the charge . A night session finally got under way Friday after 8 p. m. and final arguments lasted until 1:05 a. rn. , when the jury of eight men and four women got the case .

" Lee Harvey Oswald coiled in a sixth floor window of the Texas Schoolbook Depository building and squeezed off three shots . " The defense also contended that it was the " smirking , sneering , sneaking communist killer of our President " who incited Ruby 's delicate mental state to pull the trigger of his Colt Cobra .38 revolver and sent a slug into Oswald 's left side .
