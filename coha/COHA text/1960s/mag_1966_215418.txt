Ever since the Trung sisters spurred Viet Nam toward independence two millennia ago , women have played a major role in the nation 's life . They run not only their homes but shops , factories and farms as well . And thanks to the exploits of Mme. Nhu , everyone knows the pinnacles they can reach in politics . Last week , as South Viet Nam 's fledgling National Constituent Assembly got down to business , a new femina politica was on the ascendant : Mme. Tran Thi Xa , the lady delegate from Gia Dinh . <P> Of 19 women to run for Assembly election , the Catholic mother of eight from the Saigon suburbs was the only one to win , and hence is the only female among the 117 South Vietnamese now shaping their nation 's constitutional future . Her campaign symbol was a picture of a mother with her child in arms , the mother representing the nation and the child its people , and it helped Mme. Xa come in as the Assembly 's third highest vote getter . So did her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more careful than a man because she is being judged closer than he is , " she explains . ' That does n't mean you ca n't be Machiavellian . But be modest . They expect it . " <P> Deputy Will Do . Mme. Xa 's brand of modest Machiavellianism has already made her one of the more powerful Deputies in the Assembly . She is speaker of the credentials committee and a member of the one on flood relief-the only two committees formed so far . When she demanded that all pregnant women be released from prison , the measure passed easily . When , in a burst of patriotic pontificating common to assemblies the world over , a draft resolution supporting the Vietnamese army at home and abroad was proposed , Mme. Xa raised her delicate eyebrows . ' " Abroad ? " she asked . " We are not fighting abroad . We have all we can do here . " The phrase was struck . <P> Mme. Xa estimates that " I could wind up with enough strength to elect myself chairman " of the Assembly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immodest , " a repetition of the mistake of Mme. Nhu , who " forgot she was a woman and tried to play like a man . " Instead she will settle for deputy chairman , she says , " and a hand in writing the social-justice planks in the constitution . " <P> A Fresh Egg . The only daughter of a wealthy rice broker in North Viet Nam and the wife of a civil servant , Mme. Xa grew up " studying like a man " in a house filled with rosewood and mother-of-pearl paneling and glass windows " as blue as the sky . " Strictly chaperoned , she learned social work , painted landscapes , wrote poems to the Virgin Mary-and , at age 14 , snatched away the billy club of a policeman beating a street peddler . Her family supported the Viet Minh war for independence , then was turned out of house and home by the victorious Communists . <P> <P> Mme. Xa and her husband fled south to Saigon in 1954 , and she soon became known in the refugee-swollen quarter of Gia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organized a neighborhood school , founded a Catholic Mothers ' Association , arranged housing and relief allotments for widows . <P>
