EUROPE is shaken and unsettled . The sudden presence of 275,000 Soviet troops in Czechoslovakia has provoked a pervading sense of unease from Helsinki to Rome , tipped the military balance of power on the Continent in favor of the Warsaw Pact , and raised continuing worries about the reasonableness of the Soviet leaders . <P> <P> In both Yugoslavia and Rumania , fears intensified last week that they might be the next target for Soviet oppression . Meanwhile , a new and unlikely country joined the ranks of the anxious . It was Austria , whose political neutrality was written into the 1955 treaty that ended the victorious nations ' occupation of Hitler 's unwilling wartime ally . Since then , the Austrians have scrupulously avoided any sort of cold war entanglements . Even so , the Soviets , angered that Austria has become a haven for Czechoslovak refugees ( see following story ) , lashed out at the Austrians , charging , among other things , that the country 's press sought to " blacken and revile " Warsaw Pact forces in Czechoslovakia . As improbable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dusting off an old contingency plan to move government headquarters westward from Vienna to Innsbruck in the event the Red Army marched into the country 's eastern region , which until 13 years ago was the Soviet occupation zone . <P> Propaganda Barrage . Nowhere is Europe 's new mood of angst felt more keenly than in West Germany . Last week , as the Bundestag met for a two-day debate on the new threat to West Germany 's security , Chancellor Kurt Kiesinger expressed his people 's anxiety in careful , guarded terms . " The events in Czechoslovakia compel us to exercise a high degree of vigilance , " he said . " While the nuclear balance has diminished the threat of an all-out nu clear war , it also made a conventional attack by a potential enemy no longer seem impossible . " <P> Though the West Germans may be unduly fearful , their worries are understandable . There are now more So viet troops along West Germany 's border than at any time since 1945 . In recent months the Soviets have directed a propaganda barrage against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has accused the Federal Republic of just about every crime in the Communist lexicon , from " openly reviving Hitler 's criminal policy of expansion " to " stubbornly attempting to prepare for World War III . " <P> Relaxed Atmosphere . Part of the Soviet bluster obviously is intended for consumption in Eastern Europe , where rantings against West Germany may help divert attention from the Soviet occupation of Czechoslovakia . But the Soviets undoubtedly hope to accomplish more than that . In their view , West Germany represents the chief threat to the status quo in Eastern Europe , and behind much of the Soviet hostility lies the success of West Germany 's Ostpolitik . Until two years ago , the West German government refused to have any political dealings with the Communist countries in Eastern Europe , a rigid cold war stance that suited the Krem lin 's own aims well . Then in came the Grand Coalition , whose Foreign Minister , Willy Brandt , initiated the radical policy of attempting to establish diplomatic relations with the East bloc .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
