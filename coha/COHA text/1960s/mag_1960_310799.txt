It was a proud and colorful moment in British colonial history . Flocking into swampy Lagos to hear visiting Prime Minister Harold Macmillan address the first session of Nigeria 's new Federal Parliament , turbaned chiefs from the Moslem north swept past legislators wearing the billowy white and indigo gowns of the western Yoruba country or the rainbow hues of the east . The Emir of Kano arrived at the entrance of the Parliament in a glittering Rolls-Royce , its horn blaring . In walked the popular Finance Minister , Chief Festus Samuel Okotie-Eboh , wearing a straw boater and a figured scarf that trailed 4 yds. behind him . A jovial group of eastern M.P.s drove up in a red Dodge convertible with a big stuffed toy tiger propped up on the back seat . Finally the Speaker , in his legislative robes and wig , strode majestically into the chamber , followed by the sergeant at arms bearing the golden mace of authority . " Extraordinary , " said Macmillan with pleasure . " Nigeria has come to the threshold of independence without strife or bitterness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-rule of Nigeria 's black 35 millions , due next October , was as close to perfect as Britain could hope to achieve in Africa .

There the rising pressures for independence were giving the British a harder time . Britain 's first Prime Minister ever to tour Africa south of the Sahara would find two key trouble spots : <P> Kenya , whence last week African leaders flew off to London to renew their fight for control of the colony . Minimum demands of tough young Tom Mboya , the brains of the African delegation : internal self-government for Kenya 's 6,000,000 Africans this year , a common voting roll with universal suffrage , and only a brief transitional tutelage period in which Britons would remain in charge of Kenya 's justice , defense and foreign affairs . <P> At Mboya 's elbow during the talks will be Thurgood Marshall , general counsel of the N.A.A.C.P. , who flew to Kenya from the U.S. to advise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idea of an African government and insist that Britain remain in control indefinitely . Last week Governor Sir Patrick Renison signed a red-ribboned document formally ending the seven-year Mau Mau state of emergency . In Nairobi 's African locations , thousands of natives celebrated on a native beer called pombe , and burned the hated identification passbooks they have had to carry .
