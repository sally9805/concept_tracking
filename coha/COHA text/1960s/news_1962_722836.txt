txt Yugoslavia 's President Tito has been so signally honored &ring; his two-week stay in the Soviet Union that one can hardly be wrong in assuming that Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev had compelling reasons for lending a diplomati6-political event almost the quality of  --  a lovefest . Not only was Marshal Tito invited to address the Supreme Soviet  --  the second foreigner ever to do so  --  but on his departure home , Dec. 18 , Mr. Khrushchev rode with him as far as Kiev , a gesture , obviously intended to demonstrate the close relations between the two Communist leaders . When Mr. Khrushchev hailed Yugoslavia as " socialist " and included the League of Yugoslav Communists among the " fraternal parties , " he must have had political and ideological motivations . Economically the Soviets have nothing to gain in Yugoslavia . For Marshal Tito it must have been the other way around . While he , too , has political and ideological motivations , he is too seasoned a politician not to have sought a price for the openings which he gave Mr. Khrushchev . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have been the restoration of the $285,000,000 investment credit which the Soviets in May , 1958 , postponed for five years after their disagreement with the Yugoslav draft party program . But these are particular aspects of what the marshal called " constructive coopera- Same Aim Seen tion " between the two countries . What matters from an American point of view is the general significance of the Premier 's overtures to the Yugoslav " comrades " in the present constellation of : I. An unfolding intra-Communist debate between Moscow and Peking ; 2 . Mr. Khrushchev 's loss of prestige in some quarters as a result of the Cuban affair ; 3 . The tension in Eastern Europe where economic strains , especially in agriculture , call for reforms unpalatable to hard-core local Communists . These reforms , which may well go in the direction of the Polish and the Yugoslav model , are before the , 17th full session of the Soviet bloc 's Council for Mutual Economic Aid ( COME-CON ) which opened in Bucharest on Dec. 17 , Deep Split Cited As a " socialist country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These developments must have been present in the minds of both the Premier and the President as they addressed the Supreme Soviet . Both said that they did not wish to speak of the deeper reasons for the embroilments of the past . Mr. Khrushchev did speak of them , however . " The main part of the responsibility was with Stalin , " he said . " But we ' would be less than truthful , if we would not state that the Yugoslav comrades also had their share of responsibility . " In the past the Yugoslays abused us and we repaid them in kind . . . ' . One can not say that all the difficulties which arose ( between the two parties ) have disappeared . . . . " But Mr. Khrushchev added that " fraternal parties " do not have to agree on all questions . The main thing , he indicated , was that the Yugoslays are building socialism and " direct their efforts toward the development of their economy and the strengthening of socialist conquests . " Same Aim Seen Marshal Tito @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , also said that " there still are some differences of opinion , but we shall overcome them through constructive cooperation . " Both countries had the same aim : " the building of a new society . . . socialism and communism . " What was needed most , he added wistfully , was " mutual confidence . " The Yugoslav leader came strongly to Mr. Khrushchev 's support in discussing the Cuban crisis . " I always considered it as shortsighted to interpret peaceful steps as a sign of weakness , " he said . A nuclear war would be " a catastrophe for all mankind . " This may have been a barb at the Chinese Communists who play down the danger of nuclear war , but Marshal Tito also castigated " certain reactionary and imperialist circles who are interested in fanning the cold war . " Ending his general policy discussion on a " constructive " note he described " the conclusion without delay of an agreement forbidding nuclear tests " as " the most urgent problem . " Such an agreement would facilitate . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoided the question of control as well as all other specific questions pending . between Moscow and the West ,
