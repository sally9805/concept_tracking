Around four large wooden desks in a dirty greystone building in West Berlin , an American , a Briton , a Frenchman and a Russian work together 24 hours a day , almost as if the cold war did not exist . This is Berlin 's Air Safety Center , where the West advises East of its flights up the three air corridors over Communist territory from West Germany . The system is supposed to avoid accidents ; in fact , it neatly ties the Soviets to tacit recognition of the West 's rights to fly the disputed airlanes . Many Western officers think Russia will one day walk out of the Safety Center , leaving the Western planes to fly through the corridors unannounced , and mingle dangerously with Communist aircraft in the area . Then the West will have its signal of real trouble ahead in the skies around Berlin . <P> It may not be far off . As U.S. Secretary of State Dean Rusk prepared to talk Berlin with Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko ( see THE NATION ) , the Red propagandists were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " by Western planes . Possibly even more significant than these propaganda noises were the sounds picked up by Western airline pilots heading into Berlin : on their radios , they heard occasional interfering signals , as if the Communists were testing jamming devices to knock out the planes ' radio navigation . Some crews reported East German searchlights on them . And one afternoon last week , Pan American 's Flight No. 609 , flying well in the center of the northern corridor to Hamburg , spotted a Soviet MIG-17 fighter with six rockets under each wing soaring 200 ft. off the airliner 's right wingtip . " He just sat there , where all the passengers could see him , " said Pan Am Captain Tony Duff . When Duff 's plane entered a convenient layer of stratus cloud , the MIG peeled off and vanished , but the maneuver was an obvious hint of what could come . <P> Wayward Jets . The West was ready with its own countermeasures . The U.S. Air Force supplied navigational gadgets to help foil the jammers , and airline pilots were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already the equipment was being installed by Pan Am on the DC-6Bs it employs on the Berlin run . Plans were being discussed to slap restrictions on planes of Communist airlines on Western routes if trouble comes . And there was another way to combat obstruction of the airlanes : armed fighter escorts to fly alongside the commercial aircraft , ready to defend them with gunfire if necessary . <P> But the West was leaning over backwards to avoid an incident that would risk passengers ' lives or give the Reds an excuse to start trouble . Then one day last week , two West German jet fighters , flying back to their West German base from NATO maneuvers in France , turned up over East German Communist territory , lost and low on fuel . It was a clear violation of East Germany 's airspace , just the kind of incident to touch off trouble . The tower in West Berlin could only order the planes to land at nearby Tegel , the French airfield in Berlin , for if the pilots headed back west on nearly empty fuel tanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in German Communist territory .
