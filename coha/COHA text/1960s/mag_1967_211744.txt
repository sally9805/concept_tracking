De-Fusing the Powder Keg <P> Sir : In the language of Russian doubletalk , a nation is " peace-loving " if the Soviets think it is to their advantage to support it . However , there is no doubt that the " peace-loving " Soviets are chiefly responsible for the Middle East crisis because they armed the Arab countries and incited them to attack Israel . <P> Israel 's crime in the eyes of the Russians seems to be that it refused to let itself be destroyed . By defeating the Arabs decisively , Israel inflicted a blow to Russian prestige ; this the Soviets will not forgive . There is no doubt that the Russians are already beginning to plan for the next Arab attack against Israel . <P> NATHAN ROSEN <P> Professor of Physics <P> Israel Institute of Technology <P> Haifa , Israel <P> Sir : In view of the Soviet Union 's demand that Israel return to its original boundaries , would it not be appropriate for the Israeli representative to the U.N . to request that the Soviet Union do likewise , that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Latvia , Estonia , two portions of Finland , Czechoslovakia , Hungary , Bulgaria , Rumania and several outlying bases to their original owners ? <P> WILLIAM REEDE <P> Manhattan <P> Sir : To expect Israel now to reconstruct the original powder keg that has exploded in her face three times in the past 20 years , sparked by the desire to blow her off the map , is the height of malicious folly . Yet this is what U.S.S.R.-U.A.R. , Inc. proposes . Israel 's new borders will have to be determined by its need for open and unchallenged life lines . <P> FELIX POLLAK <P> Madison , Wis . <P> Sir : As one of the foreign professors who remained in Amman during the war but has since been evacuated , I was much impressed by the accuracy and fairness of your account . I have talked with dozens who eyewitnessed various phases in Jerusalem , Beirut and Egypt from the Arab side . Everything you said correlates , and I was happy to see King Hussein get due but not excessive credit for his heroic synthesis of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can give them . <P> WARD S. MILLER <P> Athens <P> Sir : Having discovered myself cited by you as an example of " this curious double standard " on Viet Nam and the Middle East June 9 , may I point out that Viet Nam and the Middle East are two different situations , the former marginal , the latter focal to our interests . <P> In Viet Nam we are engaged in an effort to control the situation in Asia , which is essentially futile because it is contrary to history . We can not control it because we are not an Asiatic power . The control , or dominant influence , must be exercised from within ; that is what the end of colonialism means . If Chinese Communism is to be contained , forces from within Asia must do it . Hitler could not have been defeated if there had been no force opposing him from within Europe .
