MEMOIRS 1945-53 by Konrad Adenauer. 477 pages . Regnery. $10 . <P> Memoirists are the musicians of history . Churchill 's English eloquence thumped the drumhead of World War II into a heroic thunder with his wartime memoirs . Charles de Gaulle drew a dry bow over the taut strings of French postwar political chaos to produce his searching remembrance of things past . Now Konrad Adenauer is onstage with the first volume of his memoirs , covering the period from 1945 , when Germany lay in ruins , to 1953 , when the postwar Wirtschaftswunder dawned . Adenauer 's instrument , not surprisingly , is a brisk and Bachlike clavier , well tempered by the author 's 90 years . <P> Keen Vision . " At the end of September 1944 , " he begins , " I was arrested again and sent to the Gestapo prison at Brauweiler . I was kept in solitary confinement and liked it . " Adenauer had been in and out of Nazi prisons since 1933 , when Hitler booted him from the lord-mayoralty of Cologne . At war 's end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unfazed by the horrors of defeat ( he had witnessed the decline of both Bismarck and the Kaiser ) . When the Gestapo released him during the Gtterdmmerung of the Allied advance , Adenauer trekked circuitously through the flooded Rhineland to his home at Rhndorf , then sat out a vicious artillery duel between U.S. troops at the Remagen bridgehead and Wehrmacht gunners who were dug in directly behind his house . Walking in his garden one Sunday , Adenauer came under fire . " About 300 yards away , I saw a shell hurtling towards me , " he writes . " I could gauge distances fairly well , because I knew the area intimately . " Der Alte hit the dirt , and survived to become West Germany 's first postwar Chancellor . His keen vision paid off well in both situations . <P> Adenauer saw that the old , Roman Catholic - oriented Center Party of Weimar days could no longer survive in a Germany divided first by occupation zones , then by the Iron Curtain . His Christian Democratic Union split the Center , encouraged Protestant and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , better organized Socialist Party of Kurt Schumacher to win Germany 's first free election in a generation . Then began the adroit maneuvering that brought Germany into NATO and won back the Saar coal and steel complex that France had taken . In 1953 , he made his first trip to the U.S. and stood at attention in Arlington Cemetery while an American military band played Deutschland fiber Alles.
