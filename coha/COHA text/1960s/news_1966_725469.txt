txt Two Johnson civil-rights moves now brewing on Washington 's back burners will be served up to the public more hard boiled than expected . One of these is the President 's civil-rights message to Congress . It deals , among other things , with segregated juries . A group of civil-rights leaders previewed it and found it far too weak . So the Justice Department now is making changes . The big White House conference on civil rights now ticketed for early June , is likewise under pressure . Many Negro leaders were acutely unhappy with the planning conference last November . ' Ihey are pushing to make the main show in June more to their liking . So changes are being made in it too . The President ca n't risk a civil-rights fiasco in an election year . Ird ) Another " great debate " floodlight is about to glare into yet another troubled corner of American foreign policy . Sen. Henry M. Jackson ( D ) of Washington and his Subcommittee on National Security and International Operations will open a set of public hearings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arkansas Sen. J. W. Fulbright led his dovelike Senate Foreign Relations Committee through long , controversial , televised hearings on Vietnam . Senator Jackson 's show will lead off with former Secretary of State Dean Acheson and run through a galaxy of top-level policy-makers and experts . French President de Gaulle has moved to get France out of NATO and NATO out of France . And Senator Jackson wants to air the whole thing before it reaches the " crunch stage . " Trends ... Part of keeping America strong is keeping Guam happy . Some congressmen figure that means giving the islanders more say in their own affairs . The island is a vital mid-Pacific link In Washington 's nuclear defenses . Its 44,000 natives live under American territorial rule . And Congress is mulling several bills to amplify their voice in their own government . The House Interior Committee has voted out a bill to let Guam 's natives elect their own governor . He now is appointed by the president . The committee urged elections every two years instead of four , And it struck out a provision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hearings now loom to slice the kidney-shaped island up into 21 districts . As it is , all members of the island 's one-house Legislature run at-large , and rural folk complain that city folk win more than their share of seats . The big question mark is the United States Senate . So far it has shown but little interest in changing things . How and why ... The glittering prospect of a billion-dollar government bonanza has undammed a river of high-pressure textbook-and-equipment salesmen on the nation 's schools . Local school officials are beset by a tide of attention . Salesmen are even offering to write up special projects for schools to submit to the United States Office of Education . These expertly written , slickly packaged projects always embrace a built-in plan to use the salesman 's materials . The Office of Education objects . It says it would rather have " a good original project scribbled on a piece of paper by a school principal than a slick job with a sales pitch by an outsider . " It is warning school officials not to fall for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around later for the best equipment . To American airmen flying in Vietnam , the Ho Chi Minh Trail is frustration alley . Laos allows United States pilots to bomb the trails that snake through it from North to South Vietnam . But it conditions the permission with a long list of " don'ts . " No matter how suspicious they look , villages ca n't be bombed . Yet fliers are certain some are " instant villages . " Under the " huts " hide Communist trucks full of men and supplies . When an air warning comes , the trucks stop , and it 's a " village . " Laos also insists that targets more than 200 feet from open trails and roads are off limits . So soldiers walking south travel hundreds or thousands of yards off the trails untouched by American planes . And what 's worse , they line up their ack-ack , machine guns , and rifles and just wait , safe along the side of the road , for the aircraft to run the gantlet.         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
