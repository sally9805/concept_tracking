FAREWELL , FAR EAST , headlined the London Evening Standard . In the Daily Express , Labor M.P . Desmond Donnelly called the government 's plan " the most stark military withdrawal since the Roman legions were recalled from Britain . " With a mingled sense of nostalgia and relief , Britain announced that it will gradually rid itself of the most burdensome vestige of its venerable but faded oriental empire . In a long-expected move , the government issued a Defense Ministry White Paper calling for withdrawal of all 80,000 British troops and civilians from Singapore and Malaysia by the mid-1970s . <P> The phasing out of British forces east of Suez will be part of an overall military reduction outside Europe that Britain says should save it a badly needed $216 million a year . But the decision represents as much a hello to Europe as a farewell to the Far East , since it is in large part a concession to Charles de Gaulle , who demands that Britain give up some of its far-flung responsibilities and draw closer to Europe as a condition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ envisions an eventual cut of one-fourth of Britain 's 417,360-man military force , including the already announced withdrawal next year from the troubled colony of Aden in South Arabia . The most dramatic aspect of the pullback will be the dismantling of Britain 's mammoth naval base at Singapore , whose strategic location near the Malacca Strait has long enabled Britain to police Far Eastern sea-lanes . ( Singapore has neither the ships nor the money to use the base itself , and made it clear that the U.S. Navy would not be welcome . ) Britain still plans to keep a 9,000-man garrison in beleaguered Hong Kong . <P> Defense Minister Healey said that Britain would honor its obligations to the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization but that the forces pledged to SEATO would be altered in " nature and size . " Warning against the assumption that " we will never again have to use our forces in the Far East , " Healey said that in the next decade new air craft will enable Britain to move men into the area faster and in much larger numbers than now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighter-bombers both in Singapore and in Australia . So far , there is no change in its plan to establish " staging bases " with the U.S. on tiny atolls such as Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean . It is , however , giving up much of its remaining naval striking power ; it plans to retire its four remaining aircraft carriers by the mid-1970s . <P> Troubled Allies . The planned withdrawal is as much due to Britain 's strict austerity drive-initiated a year ago-as it is to De Gaulle . The British are having a hard time trying to wipe out their foreign-trade deficit and shore up the pound , which last week was shakier than it has been for a year , partly because of trade losses stemming from the war in the Middle East . Thus , the $384 million that Britain paid last year for the upkeep of bases outside Europe looked like a luxury . Healey intends to cut this figure to about $168 million by the mid-1970s .                @ @ @ @ @
