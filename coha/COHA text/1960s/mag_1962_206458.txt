Gigot . Ugh . In the middle of the cellar sits a mighty peculiar pile of something . Could it be an igloo of grease ? Or maybe a Volkswagen wearing pajamas ? All at once a face comes out of it , and what a face ! The features are covered with hair , the hair is covered with dirt . But just as the customers are about to scream , the monster waddles comically across the floor and revolves a massive iron wheel that looks as if it opened at least a sluiceway in Grand Coulee Dam . The pipe roars like Niagara , and from the end of it rushes-a dribble . With a cake of hope the monster airily washes its face . With a burlap bag it daintily towels off and , turning to the camera , presents : <P> Jackie Gleason . Yessiree , the monster is none other than that ton of fun from television who in The Hustler scored as Minnesota Fats , a pool shark who looked like a whale with a carnation . In Gigot he scores again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mutton but who looks more like leg of dinosaur . <P> Poor Gigot . He is not very bright , and he is literally dumb . He seldom has a soul , but he has a heart of gold . People hoot and holler at him when he walks into a bistro-he smiles at them shyly . Children pin tails on the poor donkey-he never gets mad . But he longs to be a member of humanity , and one day he discovers the only place where he is accepted by other people : in a cemetery . After that , Gigot never misses a funeral . He stands at the graveside , shoulder to shoulder with the mourners , and weeps a hatful for the dear departed . What a pity , he thinks , that he had to die-I wonder who he was ? <P> In a word , Gigot is a weeper . If Comedian Gleason has his way-and he apparently had his way with John Patrick 's script and Gene Kelly 's direction-movie houses will have to supply their ushers with rowboats . Fortunately , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now and then with a button-popping belly laugh . Gleason has a gift of mimicry that verges on genius , and there are moments in this movie when the thin man struggling to get out of the fat man seems to be Charlie Chaplin .
