The Los Angeles Open , first event on the winter pro tour , is hardly the ultimate test of golf . But it does have $50,000 in prize money , and until last week , it enjoyed a certain notoriety as one of the only two major U.S. tournaments that Arnold Palmer has never won ( the other : the P.G.A . Three-time Masters cham pion , winner of the U.S. and British Opens and of more money in one year ( $81,448 last season ) than any other golfer in history , Palmer had played in the tournament seven times , had never finished better than tenth . On the 508-yd. , par-5 ninth hole at Los Angeles ' Rancho Municipal Golf Course , there is even an aluminum plaque to commemorate an event that Palmer would just as soon forget . In 1961. gambling for an eagle on the hole , he hit four balls out of bounds , wound up with a twelve . " What happened ? " asked a solicitous friend . Replied Palmer , with remarkable good humor : " I missed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ golf 's reigning king got his revenge . His tee shots caromed 300 yds. and more down Rancho 's rock-hard fairways , his approach shots died quietly inches from the pin , and his putts banged boldly into the cup . At first , other pros hogged the headlines : smooth-swinging Gene Littler led briefly ; aging ( 52 ) Dutch Harrison flashed enough of his old form to take the second-round lead ; and Art Wall , the 1959 Masters winner , shot a third-round 67 , four strokes under par . But the gallery paid little attention . By the time Palmer teed off for his final round , three strokes behind Wall , 5,000 jostling fans had enlisted in Arnie 's Army , hoping for another of the blazing finishes that make Palmer the most exciting player in golf . They got it . On the 390-yd. , par4 fourth hole . Arnie almost drove the green to set up an easy birdie .

" It was . ' ' smiled Palmer , " an easy six . " Again , on the par-3. 234yd. 17th , Palmer seemed in trouble . His No. 4 iron carried over the green on the nubby apron . 50 ft. from the pin . Palmer studied the lie . He pulled out a putter , punched the ball-and watched it roll smack into the cup for a birdie . <P> His score for that last round was a sizzling 66 ; at the end , his nearest competitor was three strokes behind . Jack Nicklaus . Palmer 's heir presumptive , wound up tied for 24th . Other pros just shrugged . Watching Palmer pocket the $9.000 winner 's check . Mike Souchak shook his head .
