THE SPEECH A Story by V. S. PRITCHETT I T 'S a funny turnout . You do n't know what front to take up for the best , " the chatty doorman replied to the big-bellied woman as he opened the door and let her and the other speakers into the hall . " You 'd better bloody well make your mind up . or you 'll be dead , " she said to him with a grin over her shoulder as she passed and followed the others up the steps onto the cold , dusty platform . And she said to the young man with heavy fair hair who was next to her when they sat down : " That 's this place for you . Did you hear him ? It 's dead . They 've had the bomb already . " A man 's voice shouted from the audience , just before Lord Birt got up to introduce the speakers : " Good old Sally . " No smile of pleasure moved her double chin , nor did she nod . She was counting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the half it would hold eight hundred ; in her time she had seen twice that number fighting their way in . Now ( she reckoned it up ) . there were no more than fifty or sixty . The weather , the sleet whipping across all day the secretary had said ) , not having had longer notice , could n't get through to headquarters on the phone . A lot of people on short time . Excuses . They had even spelled her name wrong on the notice outside : Sally Proses , leaving out the second " s , " and the sleet spitting on it made the red ink run into the blue as if the poster was 61 sobbing and ashamed of them all . They could n't get her name right , even in her own town . Lord Birt had sat down . The first speaker was up . " Friends , " he was saying , " I shall not take up your time ... " She looked at her watch . " We 'll be here half the night , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was trying to keep a piercing look on his face . " Who is he ? " " Doctor , " hissed the young man , crossing his legs . " Quaker . Liberal . " " God , " she said very audibly . It was a large hall , a yawning historic fake in a Gothic baronial style , built out of cotton profits a hundred years before , shabbied by hundreds , thousands of meetings , the air staled and exhausted by generations of preachers , mayors , and politicians , The damp had brought out a smell made of floor boards , the municipal disinfectants , the sweet , sooty cellulose effluence of the city . It was a smell provided by a dozen mills whose tall chimneys penciled the pink fume of the sky ; and by something of the fouled , milky green industrial river and the oily canal . A mist hung across the middle of the hall like breath left behind for years and although all the chandeliers were lit , the light Fell yellowish and weak on the audience sitting in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funereal stretch of empty chairs behind . One person after another turned round in discomfort looking at the distant glass doors at the back and then at the side , to see where the arctic draft came from ; and then , reproaching themselves , lifted their chins stiffly and stared with resentment at the platform . The doctor was still going on . He was a tall , very thin man , vain of his eagle face , his waving silken white hair , his gentle , high-pitched doubting vocables . They were moving equably out of " the situation before all of us today " ; then went on derisively to " the international plane " and " the lessons of history " ( his past ) , to what . he had said " in this very hall " ( references to local elections thirty years ago ) , and emerged into the benignancy of the " moral issue , " and circled impatiently to what he had " always said . " Beside him sat young Lord Birt , ace flier , Matisse English novelist , story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S. Pritchett has contributed many stories to this magazine . His newest book in the U. S. is " London Perceived , " published by Harcourt , Brace &; World . He was born in Ipswich and worked in the leather track before getting started as a newspaper correspondent in France , Spain , and Morocco.owner , lecturer in America , with a dark , prompt electric black mustache , like a too recent political decision ; and next to him the very young man . " It 's a scandal , a meeting like this , " Mrs. Prosser was saying to him audibly through the doctor 's speech . " I 'll take it up with headquarters . Where have they put you up  --  in an hotel ? 1 was out last night , God knows where , in the Treasurer 's house , and there 's been a death in the family . Imagine the atmosphere . " " Someone just died ? " said the young man , astonished . " Twenty-five years ago ! " she said sarcastically . " I 've made fourteen speeches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they had n't the decency to put me into an hotel . It 's all wrong . " And Mrs. Prosscr 's chins , month , and jaws , even her big breasts , seemed to gather themselves together until she looked like a fist . " What about Hungary ? " shouted a man from the audience . " Yes , what about Hungary ? " shouted two or three others . " They 're waking up , " said the young man . " I 'm glad you asked me that question , " said the doctor , going on . " No , it 's nothing , " she said , giving an experienced glance at the shouters . " They 're dead . How did you get here ? They did n't even have a car , borrowed it from the Treasurer 's son , it broke down . We sat on the road for half-an-hour , on a night like this . Ah , well , the old bastard is drying up . It 's you . " The young man got up . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) He had learned his speech , he was sawing it off , it fell in lumps to the floor . The women looked sympathetically , the men looked ironical , one or two of the shouters leaned Forward to egg him on at first , and then leaned back , with their hands on their knees , giving up , IIandsome , his hair flopping , he seemed to have some invisible opponent in front of him whom he was angrily trying to push away , so that he could see the audience . He struggled and at last he stopped struggling . He came to an end , looked back nervously to see if his chair was still there , and the audience clapped ; he looked back at them with suspicion and anger . " 1 made a mess of it , " he murmured to Mrs. Prosser as he sat down . - Here We go , " Mrs. Prosser ignored him . " Watch mc , if I do n't wet my drawers before I 've done with this bloody lot . " She was up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and into the hands of 62 THE SPEECH the young man , stepping in one stride to the edge of the platform . She stared at the audience , let them have a good look at her . She was a short woman of forty-seven . Robust . She was wearing a tan jumper that was low on her strong neck and pulled on anyhow , and a shabby green skirt . She had big heavy breasts , which she had been ashamed of in her young days , wanting to hide them , but that was before she joined the Movement ; a stout belly , hard as a drum , which made her laugh when she got up in the morning . Her face was round and she had a double chin and the look on her face said : " Go on ! Take a good look . It 's your last chance . " Suddenly , she let out her voice . " Fellow workers , " she shouted . The words , slow , deep , and swinging in delivery , rocked them . They stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plain Northern voice sweep out over them and to the back of the hall , filling it to the baronial beams and spreading over the seats and into the empty galleries . " Good old Sally , " shouted a man . " Come on Sally , " shouted another , wet-lipped with love at the sight of her and nudging his neighbor . She paused in the middle of her sentence and smiled fully at him  --  the first broad smile of the night . S H E loved the beginning of her speeches . " I'nt an old potato , " she thought , " but my hair is brown and alive and I 've got a voice . I can do anything with it . " It was as powerful as a man 's , yet changeable . Now it was soft , now violent ; riotous in argument yet simple ; always firm and disturbing . It could be blunt and brutal and yet it throbbed . It had sloshed its way through strikes and mass meetings ; it had rebounded off factory walls ; it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rung bitterly out through the Spanish War , when she was a young woman ; through the rows of the Second Front , the Peace Campaigns , the Hungarian quarrel ; it was all out now for Banning the Tests . It had never worn out , never coarsened , never aged ; in these first few minutes it was her blood , the inner spontaneous fountain of her girlhood , something virginal she would never lose . At every meeting it was reborn . Even her shrewd brown eyes were bemused by her utter pleasure in hearing this voice , so that each of her early sentences surprised her by their clarity and the feeling that was in them ; she was proud to feel her lungs heave , to watch the next thought form in her brain , the next argument assemble , the words , the very vowels and consonants fall into place . It was thrilling to pause and throw in a joke , a flash of hate or a line of wit that would sometimes recklessly jump into her head and make it itch with pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , played with them and made them hers . It was the time , for her , of consciousness , like a sudden falling in love , when the eyes of the audience answered her signals , when she could look carelessly from fare to face , watching her words flick like an angler 's line over them , looking for the defaulter . And , picking this man or this woman out , she would pause , as it were , to ask the audience watch her make her catch , as if she had come down off the platform to be down among them with an intimacy that teased them and made their minds twist and flick and curl with fear and pleasure . And then  --  it happened : the break , almost painful for her . The virginal voice that was so mysteriously herself , would separate from her and perform alone as if it had nothing to do with her at all . It became , simply , the Voice . It left her a plain , big-bellied , middle-aged woman , a body , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while it went off like some trained dog barking round the audience , rounding them up , fetching in some stray from the back , flinging itself against the rows of empty chairs . " And I say and I say again : we 've got to stop these tests ! We tell the Americans to stop these tests . We tell the Russians to stop these tests . We tell this Tory government that if it does not stop these tests ... ' ' Now it was harking down derisively from the gallery at the end of the hall , barking at the City Arms , at fire extinguishers , at the Roll of Honor in gold , at the brown left by the cleaner , at the draft coming in at the doors ; it was barking round the wall and below the feet of the audience . The light went out of Mrs. Prosser 's face . She let the Voice carry on , and looked with boredom at the people . There was the elderly man , deaf and impatient ; there was the big married woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see everyone was listening , like a policewoman . There were the two girls , shoulder to shoulder , with pretty false faces , waiting for a chance to whisper . There was a woman with mouth open , ravenous , as if she were going to rush the platform and kiss her . There were the threes or fours of men frosted with self-respect . There was the man who seemed , nowadays , to come to all her meetings , a man neither young nor old , listening with one car and sly , who sat at the end of a row with one bent leg sticking out of the neat block of the audience and who glanced often at the side door , as if he were waiting his chance or for a sign , to make a bolt for it . For what ? For the pubs before they closed , for the last tram , to meet someone , even just to stand in the street  --  why ? Had he got  --  a life ? It always troubled her . She wanted to follow him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a sob , as someone pushed in and gave a glance at the meeting and then went out and the door gave another gulp like the noise of a washbasin as if all the words of that Voice of hers were going down a drain . She heard the Voice go on : " For you can take it from me , if the Americans do n't stop these tests , if the Russians do n't stop these tests , if the Tory party just sits on its bum . ? . " Loud cheers . That was a word made for the North . Mrs. Prosser grinned at the Voice 's joke . She had a good big burn herself . T H E Voice went on . It carried nearly thirty years of her life . At a meeting like this  --  no , not like this , but much larger and in the open streets , in the Blackshirt days , she had met her husband . There was a shouting , arm-wrenching , tearing , kicking fight with the police . What solid lumps their bodies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt as light as air . A gale had lifted her suddenly so that she , like the rest of the scattering and re-forming crowd , was blown about and with a force in her big arms and body that was exalted . Bodies swung about like sacks of meal . The houses , and all their windows seemed to buckle and bulge toward her , the cobbled street heaved up and down like a sea . You could pick up the street in your hands . A young man near her gave a shout and she shouted , too , and her shout was his and his was hers ; for an extraordinary few moments they had the same body . A policeman struck at the young man , the blow fell on his neck and she felt the pain . She could not remember how  --  she was clawing at the policeman and the young man 's blood struck her cheek . They spent that night in prison . The pupil-leather at the Adtlerdale Road School ( Girls ) to be in prison ! That was when the hate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head up again ; they had always been decent people . The father saying : " All stuck-up with those hooks and too good for her own family . " And now she had disgraced them . If young Prosser , the little weed , came round the house again  --  the father said  --  he 'd belt him . In this very city . They sacked her from the school . From that time her life had been committees , lectures , meetings . Always traveling , always on platforms , her husband at one end of the country and she at the other . He with the shout on his face and she with the shout on hers , a drawing back of the lips over the teeth : that was their love , too . Love a shout , marriage a shout . They saw each other for an hour or two , or a day or two , eating anything , anywhere , usually a sandwich or a few bars of chocolate . It was the chocolate that had made her put on weight . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had been the nimble one , the leader , wearing himself out and often ill ; he had the ideas ; then , one week , when he was sick with an ulcer , she had taken a meeting and the Voice , this strange being inside her came out , and now it was she who not only commanded him , but audiences by the hundred , then the thousands . The Voice took over her own and her husband 's life . And they stick me at a place nine miles outside this city ( her body , her bullying breasts and affronted belly were saying ) , in weather like this ! I do n't say I was n't comfortable . That 'd be a lie . I was glad to see a coal fire and the tea was better than that slop they gave us at Lord Birt 's this afternoon . Three-piece suite too and the telly on , very nice . You would n't have seen that in our home when I was a girl . We had a laugh too about Lord Birt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a maid there when she was a girl and they used to bless those chimneys . My husband and I did our courting up there in the woods above . Mrs. Jenkins and 1 had a good laugh about old times . And then the old lady , Mr. Jenkins ' mother , got restless . " Eh , " says Mrs. Jenkins , " mother wants her telly . We turned it off when you came . She sits there in front of it , tapping her toes on the floor when the cowboys go by , rocking up and down . " " You want to get on your horse and ride the range , Gran , do n't you ? " says Harry Jenkins , the lad . " Gran 's in her saddle , reaching for her gun when the Westerns come on . She gets excited , do n't you Gran ? " Of course , the old lady was stone deaf and could n't hear a word he said . But she looks at me and says , suddenly : " That 's Sally Gray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That 's Sally Gray . " " No , Gran , that 's Mrs. Prosser . Excuse her , Mrs. Prosser , the mind ... She 's failing . " " It 's Sally Gray , " says the old lady . " Now , Gran ! " says Mrs. Jenkins . " You be a good girl . " " It 's the girl that killed our Leslie . It 's Sally 69 THE SPEECH Gray that sent our boy to Spain and killed him . " " Gran , " says Mrs. Jenkins . " Stop that . I wo n't have you upset us . Excuse her , Mrs. Prosser . My husband 's brother was killed in the Spanish War . She does n't forget it . " " It 's Sally Gray , the schoolteacher , who went to prison and got her name in the papers and broke poor Mrs. Gray 's heart . " The old lady stands flapping her little hands about and turning round and round like a dog . The atmosphere  --  you can imagine it ! " Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's a long time ago . " " Tuesday , we heard , " the old lady said . " Gran , " says the lad , taking the old lady 's arm to steady her , " do n't carry on . It 'd be a had day for the workers if they did n't fight for themselves . Uncle Les was an idealist . " Nine miles outside the town in weather like this ! " I 'm sorry , Mrs. Prosser . " says Mrs. Jenkins . " Switch on the telly , Harry . She 's a great problem . Definitely . " " I could kill her , " says Mrs. Jenkins standing up stiff . And she suddenly picks up the teapot and rushes out of the room , crying . " Excuse us , " says Mr. Jenkins giving the old lady a shake . What a committee to pun me in a house like that with a madwoman . Where 's the consideration ? And they bring me here in a borrowed car that breaks down and we stand there on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And they spell your name wrong and scrape up an audience of ten or twenty people . T HERE was a cheer from the audience . The Voice had got into them . Mrs. Prosser paused : she was startled herself . And as she paused For the cheer and the Voice cracked a thin joke about the Foreign Secretary ? " They fly about from Bonn to Washington , from Washington to London ; you do n't sec them flying down here , They 're afraid of getting their feathers dirty " ? and got a laugh from them , a dirty , drafty laugh , which gave the man at the end of the row a chance to get his leg out further and get ready to make a bolt for it  --  at that very second , she saw the dead white lace of the clock at the end of the hall , its black hands like a jackknife , opening . Ten to nine ! Her husband down at Plymouth , the other end of the country . And Jack ? Where is Jack ? But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had picked up its freedom again and sailed on , she silently asked the audience : Where 's my son ? What have you done with myson ? A year ago I could tell you what he was doing . He 'd come home from school , get himself some supper , that boy could cook , oh yes , and clean up afterwards  --  and then settle to his homework . He could look after himself , better than a grown man . From the age of nine he could manage on his own . My husband and I could leave him a week at a time and he did n't mind . And I 'll tell you something else : a boy with a real political conscience ! You 've done it  --  her body was shouting to the audience  --  you 've done it ! For twenty-five years my husband and I have been fighting for you , fighting the class enemy , getting justice for you and you sit there  --  what is left of you  --  pulling in the big money , drunk on Hire Purchase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what do you do for us ? When I knew I was going to have that boy I said to my husband : " We wo n't let this stop the work . " And we did n't . But you anti your rotten society just did nothing . A year ago he was the best boy in this country and you could n't stand it . No . You had to get him out and start him drinking with a lot of thieving hooligans , you put a flick knife in his hand . You know what he said to his father ? " Well , you were in prison , you and mother , you told me . " " Son , " his father said , " we were fighting for justice for the people . " " Oh that crap ! " he says . That 's what the great British people did while we were working for them . Those people out there lost a son twenty-five years ago in Spain . I want to tell you I lost mine last year  --  killed by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience shouted . " Hit ' em . Listen to her . " Mrs. Prosser paused with a smile of victory . " But , my friends , you will say to me , " the Voice suddenly became quiet and reasonable , " this government can not act alone . It has got to consider the American government and the Russian government . You will say the British people can not isolate itself from the human family . . . " But Mrs. Prosser was saying to them : Before I came here this evening they took me to this Lord Bin 's house , the one I told you about with all those chimneys ; very friendly those chimneys looked when we were courting in the wood above . My husband and I used to look down at the house . And the time 1 liked best was when the smoke was going up straight from them in the autumn . Some weekends when there was company at the house the smoke went up from 65 many of them like it does from his Lordship 's mills , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and round over it and hear a dog drag its chain and bark , or hear pails clash where they were washing the car or swooshing out the yard at the back  --  I always wanted to see inside when I was a girl . Well today I saw it . Oh yes ! There I was inside sitting by the fire with a cat on my knees . Can you see me with a cat ? There were some people there and after we 'd had our meal this young man who just made that bad speech was there looking at the books in the white bookcases . And there was a young girl , plump with brown hair , talking to him about them . Lord Birt asked hint where they 'd been that morning and they said : " Up the woods at the back . " I 'll tell you something . I was jealous . I was jealous of that young girl talking to that young man . I felt old and ugly and fat . Mind you , I do n't like the way these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the tadpoles we used to catch when we were kids . I 'd split them myself , you 'd have a Iaugh  --  but it was n't that that made me jealous . I could n't talk about anything . That lad ca n't make a speech , but he can talk and so could the girl . I sat there dumb and stupid . Every day , morning and evening , year after year , generation after generation , this was a home and they could talk about a subject in it . If you talked about a subject in my home when I was a girl they 'd call you stuck up . All I can do is to make bloody fine speeches in bloody empty halls like this . T HERE was coughing in the audience and now the Voice was quieter . The man sitting at the end of the row with his leg out made up his mind . He got both legs out and , bending slightly , thinking to make himself invisible , he slowly tiptoed out across the bare space to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty heads , in the midst of their coughing , turned to watch , but not that widely smiling woman whowas still looking ravenously up at the platform as if she were going to rush at Mrs. Prosser and swallow her . Mrs. Prosser saw the man tiptoeing out to that life of his and she did what she always could do , at any meeting , startle it out of its wits with a sudden shout , and make any escaper stop in his absurd delinquent steps . " Fellow Workers , " the Voice rang out , " do n't kid yourselves . You wo n't escape . It is you and your children who arc being betrayed by this cowardly government . It is you . .. " But her life , the forty-five-year-old body with the big , white mournful bottom was saying to them : And if you want to know what I thought when I passed the long mirror in the hall of Lord Birt 's house when we were getting in the car to come to this place where I was born and brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if you want to know what I thought , I can tell you . It 's you have made me ugly ! Working for you ! You never gave me a minute to read a book , look at a picture , or feed the spirit inside me . It was you who made me sit dumb as an old cow back there . You fight for justice and you lose half your life . You 're ugly and you 've made me as ugly as you are . The applause went up sharp and short near the platform and echoed in the emptiness behind the audience . Chairs shifted . Mrs. Prosser sat down . Lord Bin and the young man congratulated her . She looked scornfully and boastfully at them . " I 've wet them , " she said as they walked away down the steps off the platform . Out of the little crowd of people who had stayed behind to talk to the speakers , the young girl came forward and secretively , not to embarrass him , squeezed the young man 's arm and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listened but was looking eagerly into the crowd that surrounded Mrs. Prosser . " We 'll wait for her , " he said fiercely . " She had them " ? he held out his cupped hand ? " like that . "
