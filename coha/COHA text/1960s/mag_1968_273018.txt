Pediatrician Benjamin Spock , who is more concerned these days with pacifists than pacifiers , seemed openly to seek arrest in hopes that he could eventually test his crusade against the Viet Nam war before the Supreme Court . Last week at Boston 's Federal District Court , he moved closer to that goal . An all-male jury pronounced Spock , 65 , guilty of conspiring to counsel and abet young men in evading the draft . Also found guilty : Yale Chaplain William Sloane Coffin Jr. , 44 , Harvard Graduate Student Michael Ferber , 23 , and Writer Mitchell Goodman , 44 . The fifth member of " the Boston Five , " Marcus Raskin , 34 , a former White House disarmament aide , was acquitted . <P> The trial , which gained notoriety from Spock 's presence , had dragged on for 19 days , and would probably have lasted longer had not 85-year-old Judge Francis J. W. Ford pushed the pace by regularly growling , " That 's irrelevant . " The plethora of evidence gathered by the prosecution included literature and statements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attended by some of the defendants . The defense sought to counter the conspiracy charge by claiming that the five were acting as individuals ( the jury agreed in Raskin 's case ) , and that their approach was a form of free speech . <P> Coffin greeted the sentence with a droll " I think they have confused the lightning bugs with the lightning . " Of the guilty four , draft-age Ferber stands to lose least from the verdict . While appealing the case , he is a free man ; had he been let off , he would have faced immediate induction . Presumably , Ferber would have refused to serve , and thereby become liable for prosecution under the Selective Service Act .
