The Swiss Alps above St. Moritz were still white with the hard-packed snows of winter , and here and there April showers had laid a blanket of fresh , wet snow on top . To the casual eye , it was beautiful . But the beauty was lost on officials at the Institute for Snow Research and Avalanches in Davos . Tests indicated that the new snow was not binding with the old . And when warm weather followed last week , and the snow began to melt , the warning flashed out quickly : " Lawine Avalanche ! " <P> Danger never bothered Wallace ( " Bud " ) Werner . He did not deliberately tempt it ; for him it just never existed . Some might call that ignorant or childish or foolhardy , but within the special company of downhill racers , Bud Werner won only admiration and respect . Austrians called him " the cowboy from Colorado " ; autographed photos of his boyish face decorated the walls of stores and inns in ski towns like Kitzbhel and Bad Gastein . <P> Bud Werner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The son of a rancher from Steamboat Springs , Colo. , he had never even been on a train or plane when , at 17 , he traveled to Europe and in Norway beat Europe 's best . If Olympic medals are a true test of a skier 's ability , Werner was a failure , because he never won any . He broke a leg training for the 1960 Winter Olympics , and by the time this year 's Games rolled around , he was 28 and past his peak . But over the years , he won the big races at Chamonix and Wengen and Courchevel , and when he did not win , Bud mostly crashed-because he was a one-man U.S. team trying to defeat the Austrians , French , Germans , Swiss and Italians , who always dominated the sport . Nobody ever skied faster than Werner . Some kept their feet . <P> After the Olympics , Werner retired from racing , but last week he was back in the Alps-this time starring in a movie sponsored by German Clothing Manufacturer Willy Bogner . Disregarding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slopes of the Selin Valley above St. Moritz . Cameras whirred ; Werner and 14 other skiers started down the hill . Suddenly , there was a sharp crack , and tons of snow thundered toward the valley floor below . By scrambling and flailing , most of the 15 " swam " on top of the avalanche to safety . Not Werner . And not Barbi Henneberger , 23 , a pretty German skier . Together , they tried to race the 500-ft. - wide wall of snow . <P> Barbi never had a chance . But Bud almost won the race . Crouched far for ward , poles tucked tightly under his arms , he strained for speed ; horrified onlookers guessed that he was hitting 50 m.p.h . Then , just 15 ft. from safety , he stumbled , staggered and fell . By the time rescuers found the two skiers , four hours later , both were dead .
