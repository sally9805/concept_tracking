txt Letters to The Times PAUL W. BACHMAN , HENRY A. BERLINERTHOMAS B. TURNER , M.D.GEORGE BIDDLE . Letters to The Times To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : A retired mechanical engineer , I have had considerable experience in the development and production of military equipment , some of it of a fairly complicated and sophisticated nature . Both professionally and socially , I have spent much of the last 10 years in the company of military men , which I believe has given me a better than average background of military planning . In 1942 and part of 1943 I served in the Eighth Air Force as chief of war plans , first under General Spaatz and later under General Eaker . The course being pursued by the Administration has one feature which has caused me a great deal of concern . This has been discussed with numerous competent persons who I find agree with the cardinal point of my criticism . This criticism I direct against the 3e-emphasis of the military aspects ) f space by the United States . See editorial April @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are making every effort to levise means of utilizing space for ) ffensive and defensive military . ) urposes . The recent Soviet moon shot diFelled only a small part of their ; pace capabilities . This keeps our Lttention focused on a prestige proj  --  et which denies billions of dollars Ind man-hours to the development ) 4 space weapons . It is the belief of a great many ) f us that practically all of our Tace projects being worked on should be of a military nature . A great deal of new scientific knowledge and methods is sure to come out of a military program even though it is not designed specifi. cally to achieve this goal . Certainly the next 10 to V years are extremely critical . Should the Communist world achieve mili. tary dominance over the free world , our way of life will have gone forever , and I find the course we are pursuing to be so dangerous as to be suicidal . Before it is too late , let us reorient our space program . HENRY A. BERLINER , Washington , April @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Funds for Universities Is Backed The writer of the following fa Dean of the Johns Hopkins Medical School . To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES 1 In your April 7 editorial " Torpid Spring on Capitol Hill " the medical education bill is referred to as one which now has some chance of being acted upon by the Congress . This bill , H , R. 12 , correctly labeled an educational bill , is , however , far more than this ; it is also a health bill in the most pressing sense of that term . Because there is a possibility that H.R. 12 when it reaches the floor of the House may be caught in a jurisdictional whipsaw , education versus health , the importance of its passage should be understood by the people of the country . The main purpose of H.R. 12 is to provide thatching funds to universities , both private and state , for the construction of medical educational facilities which will permit the opening of new medical schools or the expansion of existing ones , Except for the question of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Physicians The country faces an impending serious shortage of medical manpower , especially physicians . Toplevel studies in the past five years have highlighted the fact that merely to keep abreast of the growing population of the United States some 3,600 additional physicians must be graduated each year by 1970 , Ten to 20 new medical schools will be needed , plus the expansion of existing schools . From the planning stage of a new medical school until its first graduates enter practice requires eight to 10 years . Clearly we must move now . Already shortages exist and are being partially met by immigration of foreign medical graduates , mostly from countries whose , medical needs are greater than milt Statements that too many physicians engage in research , too many become specialists rather than family physicians , should not obscure the basic fact that within a decade at the present rate of graduation there will simply not be enough doctors in the United States to provide the quality or quantity of medical care the American people expect . The Federal Government should make available incentive funds for this important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not undertake this costly job alone , THOMAS B. TURNER , M. D. Baltimore , Md. , April 8 , 1963 . Biddle on Newness in Art TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : In John Canaday 's excellent article on the Armory Exhibition in The Times of April 7 he drew the distinction between the true avantgardist of today , the " conspicuous loner , " and what he alluded to as " any art with the capacity to stimulate shrieks and groans , " " every freak that has come along " and " the great mass of abstract expressionism or you-name-it . " I quite agree , And would it here be pertinent to point out the insidious yet pervasive assumption , current in almost the entire field of contemporary art criticism , that technidal innovation is synonymous with artistic excellence ? That wise old man Bernard Berenson remarks somewhere in his " North Italian Painters " : " One may ask why if Domenico Brusasorci ( the first purely pictorial painter in Italy and historically of the highest order of importance ) brought in as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great as Giotto or Mantegna . " The answer is simple , Newness is a very minor consideration in the world of art . In that world it is the intrinsic value that counts . " These words might fittingly be carved over the portals of our art schools and such of our museums as pride themselves on being modern . GEORGE BIDDLE , Croton-on-Hudson , N. Y. , April 9 , 1963 . To Advise Congress Problem of Evaluating Projects of Magnitude Discussed To THE EDITOROF THE NEW YORK TIMES Referring to the April 7 editorial , " Confusion in Space " and the article by John W. Finney entitled " Congress Has Second Thoughts on Space Funds , " appearing in the same issue , we would like to express approval of the principles e : : pressed in both . The question in this editorial , " are we getting our money 's worth ? " appears particularly appropriate . The space race and its heretofore insatiable requirement for more funds and technical manpower is by no means the only example of research and development activities about which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it stands as a glaring example . To be specific , the budget for research into manned space flight has increased from slightly over $500 million in fiscal year 1962 to an estimated $2.7 billion for fiscal year 1964 . Without commenting on the philosophy underlying this program , it nevertheless appears reasonable to ask if any organization , Government or private , can undergo such a rapid rate of expansion in so short a period of time and absorb it efficiently . Authorizing Expenditures As Mr. Finney points out , " no one in Congress has the temerity to challenge directly the basic objective of beating Russia to the moon , " but belatedly Congressmen " are beginning to appreciate the magnitude of the effort . .. . " This clearly illustrates a basic problem facing Congress today : it is being called upon to authorize and appropriate vast sums of money for research and technological activities , without , in many cases , having available to it competent , outside evaluation of the worth of the proposed program . Executive departments and agencies make frequent use of scientists and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have similar advisers , Therefore , it appears that Congress , or its members , would find useful the advice of citizens who have or have had direct responsibility for the selection , technicaleconomic evaluation and over-all management of research and development projects of the size and scope of those carried on in major industrial laboratories . Such highly trained and qualified individuals , in all likelihood , would be willing to assist Congress on specific problems with the result that Congressmen could be provided with a sound appraisal of the value of any proposed research . Under the circumstances it could reasonably be expected that Government expenditures for research and development would be more effectively used and on programs for which other private capabilities do not exist . Perhaps the " confusion in space " and in other areas would not be eliminated completely , but it would be lessened and made somewhat more manageable . PAUL W. BACHMAN , Chairman , Research Committee , National Association of Manufacturers . New York , April 10 , 1963 . Military Aspects of Space         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
