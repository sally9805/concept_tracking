The earth and its nearby partner the moon live in an orderly neighborhood ; only at vast intervals , millions of years apart , is the area blasted by trouble . Then a giant meteor , perhaps a wanderer from the asteroid belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter , streaks into range . If it happens to hit the earth , it blasts a crater many miles across , sometimes melting nearby rock and spewing out slaglike material called impactite . If it collides with the moon , the crashing meteor produces glassy objects called tektites , which many scientists believe are knocked out of lunar craters , solidified in space and dropped on earth . <P> High-level argument about tektites and impactites has hung on for years , but at last week 's New York meeting of the Geological Society of America , Drs . Robert L. Fleischer and P. Buford Price of General Electric Co. produced some of the first hard facts about them . Using a new dating method , the G.E . scientists proved that most tektites were formed either 34 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known deposits of impactites have the same three ages . <P> Damaged Spots . The General Electric dating method , which was developed with Air Force backing , depends on the fact that nearly all rocks , including tektites and impactites , contain small traces of uranium . The uranium atoms split , at a slow , known rate and the fission fragments damage the glassy material in which they are embedded . The damaged spots are microscopic , but they can be made visible by a special etching technique . When they are carefully counted and compared with the amount of uranium present , those spots tell how long they have been accumulating and the date when the rock solidified . <P> The G.E . scientists tested their new dating system on tektites found in Canada and the U.S. All proved to be 34 million years old . Impactites from the Clearwater Lake crater in northern Quebec and from far-off Libya have the same age . Other tests show that tektites found in Czechoslovakia pair up with impactites from an ancient meteor crater in Germany . Both are 15 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old , the same age as tektites found in Australia , Indonesia and Southeast Asia . <P> Three Hits . Why should tektites and impactites have the same ages ? One explanation , think Fleischer and Price , is that when very large meteors hit the moon they do more than splash out molten moon-rock that falls to earth as small , harmless tektites . They also detach large chunks of the lunar crust heavy enough to blast craters and form impactite when they hit the earth 's surface . This has happened , the scientists think , at least three times in rather recent geological history . And they suspect that a lot of moon-stuff will be found on earth as soon as fellow scientists figure out how to identify it .
