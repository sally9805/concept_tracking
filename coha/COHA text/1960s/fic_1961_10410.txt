about a nice , kind family man who cuts down wife and children with an ax . I think I believe that a man is changing all the time . But there are certain moments when the change becomes noticeable . If I wanted to dig deep enough , I could probably trace the seeds of my change right back to my birth or before . Recently many little things had begun to form a pattern of larger things . It 's as though events and experiences nudged and jostled me in a direction contrary to my normal one or the one I had come to think was normal  --  the direction of the grocery clerk , the failure , the man without real hope or drive , barred in by responsibilitiesfor filling the bellies and clothing the bodies of his family , caged by habits and attitudes I thought of as being moral , even virtuous . And it may be that I had a smugness about being what I called a " Good Man . " And surely I knew what was going on around me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't live in a town the size of New Baytown and not know . I did n't think about it much . Judge Dorcas fixed traffic tickets for favors . It was n't even secret . And favors call for favors . The Town Manager , who was also Budd Building Supplies , sold equipment to the township at a high price , and some of it not needed . If a new paved street went in , it usually turned out that Mr. Baker and Marullo and half a dozen other business leaders had bought up the lots before the plan was announced . These were just facts of nature , but I had always believed they were n't facts of my nature . Marullo and Mr. Baker and the drummer and Margie Young-Hunt and Joey Morphy in a concentration had been nudging me and altogether it amounted to a push , so that " I 've got to put aside a little time to think it out . " My darling was purring in her sleep , with the archaic smile on her lips , and she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love , a calm fulfilledness . I should have been sleepy after wandering around thep101night before , but I was n't . I 've noticed that I am rarely sleepy if I know I can sleep long in the morning . The red dots were swimming on my eyes , and the street light threw the shadows of naked elm branches on the ceiling , where they made slow and stately cats ' cradles because the spring wind was blowing . The window was open halfway and the white curtains swelled and filled like sails on an anchored boat . Mary must have white curtains and often washed . They give her a sense of decency and security . She pretends a little anger when I tell her it 's her lace-curtain Irish soul . I felt good and fulfilled too , but whereas Mary dives for sleep , I did n't want to go to sleep . I wanted to go on fully tasting how good I felt . I wanted to think about the I Love America Essay Contest my offspring were entering . But behindthese and others , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do about it , so naturally I got out the last thing first and I found that the dark jury of the deep had already decided for me . There it was , laid out and certain . It was like training for a race and preparing and finally being down at start with your spikes set in their holes . No choice then . You go when the pistol cracks . I found I was ready with my spikes set , waiting only for the shot . And apparently I was the last to know . All day people had remarkedthat I looked well , by that meaning I looked different , more confident , changed . That drummer had a look of shock in the afternoon . Marullo had inspected me uneasily . And Joey-boy felt the need to apologize for something I had done . Then Margie Young-Hunt  --  maybe she was the sharpestwith her rattlesnake dream . Some way she had penetratedand discovered a certainty about me before I was certain of it . And the symbol was a rattlesnake . I found I was grinning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used the oldest trick  --  the threat of infidelity , a bait cast in a flowingtide to find what fish are feeding there . I did n't remember the secret whisper of her hidden body  --  no , the picturep102was of her clawed hands that showed age and nervousness and the cruelty that comes to one when control of a situation is lost . Sometimes I wish I knew the nature of night thoughts . They 're close kin to dreams . Sometimes I can direct them , and other times they take their head and come rushing over me like strong , unmanaged horses . Danny Taylor came in . I did n't want to think about him and be sad but he came anyway . I had to use a trick a tough old sergeant taught me once , and it works . There was a day and a night and a day in the war that was all one piece , one unit of which the parts were just about all the dirty dreadfulnessthat can happen in that sick business . While it was going on I 'm not sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tired , but afterward that unit of a day and a night and a day came back to me over and over again in my night thoughts until it was like that insanity they call battle fatigue and once named shell-shock . I used every trick I could not to think of it , but it crept back in spite of me . It waited through the day to get at me in the dark . Once mawkish with whisky I told it to my top sergeant , an old pro who had been in wars we have forgotten ever happened . If he had worn his ribbons , there 'd have been no room for buttons  --  Mike Pulaski , a polack from Chicago , no relation to the hero . By good fortune , he was decently drunk or he might have clammed up out of a conditioned conviction about fraternizing with an officer . Mike heard me out , staring at a spot between my eyes . " Yeah ! " he said . " I know about that . Trouble is , a guy tries to shove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What you got to do is kind of welcome it . " " How do you mean , Mike ? " " Take it 's something kind of long  --  you start at the beginningand remember everything you can , right to the end . Every time it comes back you do that , from the first rightp103through the finish . Pretty soon it 'll get tired and pieces of it will go , and before long the whole thing will go . " I tried it and it worked . I do n't know whether the headshrinkersknow this but they should . When Danny Taylor came into my night I gave him Sergeant Mike 's treatment . When we were kids together , same age , same size , same weight , we used to go to the grain and feed store on High Street and get on the scales . One week I 'd be half a pound heavier and the next Danny would catch up with me . We used to fish and hunt and swim together and go out with the same girls . Danny 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of New Baytown . The Taylor house is that white one with the tall fluted columns on Porlock Street . Once the Taylors had a country house too  --  about three miles from town . The country all around us is rolling hills covered with trees , some scrub pine and some with second-growth oak , and hickory and some cedars . Once , long before I was born , the oaks were monsters , so big that the local-built ships had cut their keels and ribs and planking within a short distanceof the shipyards until it was all gone . In this rolypolycountry the Taylors once had a house set in the middle of a big meadow , the only level place for miles around . It must once have been a lake bottom because it was flat as a table and surrounded by low hills . Maybe sixty years ago , the Taylor house burned down and was never rebuilt . As kids Danny and I used to ride out there on bicycles . We played in the stone cellar and built a hunting lodge of bricks from the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see avenues of trees and a suggestion of formal hedges and borders among the scrabble of the returnedforest . Here and there would be a stretch of stone balustrade , and once we found a bust of Pan on a tapering stand . It had fallen on its face and buried its horns andp104beard in the sandy loam . We stood it up and cleaned it and celebrated it for a time , but greed and girls got the betterof us . We finally carted it into Floodhampton and sold it to a junk man for five dollars . It must have been a good piece , maybe an old one . Danny and I were friends as all boys must have friends . Then his appointment to the Naval Academy came through . I saw him once in uniform and not again for years . New Baytown was and is a tight , close-made town . Everyone knew Danny was expelled and no one discussed it . Taylors died out , well , just as Hawleys died out . I 'm the only one left , and , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come back until they were all dead , and he came back a drunk . At first I tried to help but he did n't want me . He did n't want anybody . But , in spite of it , we were close  --  very close . I went over everything I could remember right up to that very morning when I gave him the dollar to let him find his local oblivion . The structure of my change was feeling , pressures from without , Mary 's wish , Allen 's desires , Ellen 's anger , Mr. Baker 's help . Only at the last when the move is mounted and prepared does thought place a roof on the building and bring in words to explain and to justify . Suppose my humble and interminable clerkship was not virtue at all but a moral laziness ? For any success , boldness is required . Perhaps I was simply timid , fearful of consequences  --  in a word , lazy . Successful business in our town is not complicated or obscureand it is not widely successful either , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crimes are little crimes and so their success is small success . If the town government and the business complex of New Baytown were ever deeply investigated it would be found that a hundred legal and a thousand moral rules were broken , but they were small violations  --  petty larceny . They abolished part of the Decalogue and kept the rest . Andp 105when one of our successful men had what he needed or wanted , he reassumed his virtue as easily as changing his shirt , and for all one could see , he took no hurt from his derelictions , always assuming that he did n't get caught . Did any of them think about this ? I do n't know . And if small crimes could be condoned by self , why not a quick , harsh , brave one ? Is murder by slow , steady pressure any less murder than a quick and merciful knife-thrust ? I do n't feel guilt for the German lives I took . Suppose for a limited time I abolished all the rules , not just some of them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be reassumed ? There is no doubt that business is a kind of war . Why not , then , make it all-out war in pursuit of peace ? Mr. Baker and his friends did not shoot my father , but they advised him and when his structure collapsed they inherited . And is n't that a kind of murder ? Have any of the great fortunes we admire been put together without ruthlessness ? I ca n't think of any . And if I should put the rules aside for a time , I knew I would wear scars but would they be worse than the scars of failure I was wearing ? To be alive at all is to have scars . All this wondering was the weather vane on top of the building of unrest and of discontent . It could be done because it had been done . But if I opened up that door , could I ever get it closed again ? I did not know . I could not know until I had opened it . . . . Did Mr. Baker know ? Had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old Cap'n thought the Bakers burned the Belle-Adair for the insurance . Could that and my father 's misfortune be the reason Mr. Baker wanted to help me ? Were these his scars ? What was happening could be described as a great ship being turned and bunted and shoved about and pulled around by many small tugs . Once turned by tide and tugs , it must set a new course and start its engines turning . On the bridge which is the planning center , the question mustp106be asked : All right , I know now where I want to go . How do I get there , and where are lurking rocks and what will the weather be ? One fatal reef I knew was ' talk . So many betray themselvesbefore they are betrayed , with a kind of wistful hungerfor glory , even the glory of punishment . Andersen 's Well is the only confidant to trust  --  Andersen 's ' Well . I called out to old Cap'n . " Shall I set the course , sir ? Is it a good course ? Will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time he denied me his command . " You 'll have to work it out yourself . What 's good for one is bad for another , and you wo n't know till after . " The old bastard might have helped me then , but perhaps it would n't have made any difference . No one wants advice  --  only corroboration.  |p107WHEN  I awakened , old sleepy Mary was up and gone and coffee and bacon were afoot . I could smell them . And you 'd have to search for a better day for a resurrection , a green and blue and yellow day . From the bedroom window I could see that everything was resurrecting , grass , trees . They chose a proper season for it . I put on my Christmas dressing gown and my birthday slippers . In the bathroom I found some of Allen 's hair goo and slicked it on , so that my combed and brushed scalp felt tight like a cap . Easter Sunday breakfast is an orgy of eggs and pancakes , and bacon curling about everything . I crept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Kyrie eleison ! " " Oh ! " she said . " I did n't hear you coming . " She regarded my dressing gown , paisley pattern . " Nice , " she said . " You do n't wear it enough . " " I have n't time . I have n't had time . " " Well , it 's nice , " she said . " Ought to be . You picked it . Are the kids sleeping through these wonderful smells ? " " Oh , no . They 're out back , hiding eggs . I wonder what Mr. Baker wants . " The quick jump never fails to startle me . " Mr. Baker , Mr. Baker . Oh ! He probably wants to help me start my for-tune. "  | " Did you tell him ? About the cards ? " " Course not , darling . But maybe he guessed . " Then I said seriously , " Look , cheesecake , you do think I have a great business brain , do n't you ? " " What do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning , and it stayed up . " Mr. Baker thinks I should invest your brother 's legacy . " " Well , if Mr. Baker  --  " " Now wait . I do n't want to do it . That 's your money and your safety . " " Does n't Mr. Baker know more about that than you do , dear ? " " I 'm not sure . All I know is my father thought he knew . That 's why I 'm working for Marullo . " " Still , I think Mr. Baker  --  " " Will you be guided by me , sweetheart ? " " Well , of course  --  " " In everything ? " " Are you being silly ? " " I 'm dead serious  --  dead ! " " I believe you are . But you ca n't go around doubting Mr. Baker . Why , he 's  --  he 's  --  " " He 's Mr. Baker . We 'll listen to what he has to say and then  --  I still will want that money right in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back door as though fired by a slingshot . " Marullo , " he said . " Mr. Marullo 's outside . He wants to see you . " " Now what ? " Mary demanded . " Well , ask him in . " " I did . He wants to see you outside . " " Ethan , what is it ? You ca n't go out in your robe . It 's Easter Sunday . " " Allen , " I said , " you tell Mr. Marullo I 'm not dressed . Tell him he can come back later . But if he 's in a hurry , hep109can come in the front door if he wants to sec me alone . " He dashed . " I do n't know what he wants . Maybe the store 's been robbed . " Allen shot back . " He 's going around front . " " Now , dear , do n't you let him spoil your breakfast , you hear me ? " I went through the house and opened the front door . Marullo was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mass , and his best was black broadcloth and big gold watch chain . He held his black hat in his hand and he smiled at me nervously like a dog out of bounds . " Come in . " " No , " he said . " I just got one word to say . I heard how that fella offered you a kickback . " " Yes ? " " I heard how you threw him out . " " Who told you ? " " I ca n't tell . " He smiled again . " Well , what about it ? You trying to say I should have taken it ? " He stepped forward and shook my hand , pumped it up and down twice very formally . " You 're a good fella , " he said . " Maybe he did n't offer enough . " " You kidding ? You 're a good fella . That 's all . You 're a good fella . " He reached in his bulging side pocket and brought out a bag . " You take this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welter of embarrassment turned and fled ; his short legs pumped him away and his fat neck flamed where it bulged over his stiff white collar . " What was it ? " I looked in the bag  --  colored candy Easter eggs . We had a big square glass jar of them at the store . " He brought a present for the kids , " I said.  | " Marullo ? Brought a present . I ca n't believe it . " " Well , he did . " " Why ? He never did anything like that . " " I guess he just plain loves me . " " Is there something I do n't know ? " " Duck blossom , there are eight million things none of us know . " The children were staring in from the open back door . I held out the bag to them . " A present from an admirer . Do n't get into them until after breakfast . " As we were getting dressed for church , Mary said , " I wish I knew what that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to admit , darling , I wish I knew what it was all about too . " " But a bag of cheap candy  --  " " Do you suppose it might be a grave simplicity ? " " I do n't understand . " " His wife is dead . He has neither chick nor child . He 's getting old . Maybe  --  well , maybe he 's lonely . " " He never has been here before . While he 's lonesome , you should ask him for a raise . He does n't drop in on Mr. Baker . It makes me nervous . " I gauded myself like the flowers of the field , decent dark suit , my burying black , shirt and collar so starchly white they threw the sun 's light back in the sun 's face , cerulean tie with cautious polka dots . Was Mrs. Margie Young-Hunt whomping up ancestral storms ? Where did Marullo get his information ? It could only be Mr. Bugger to Mrs. YoungHunt to Mr. Marullo . I do not trust thee Margie Young , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know and know right spung , I do not trust thee Mrs. Young . And with that singing in my head I delved in the garden for a white flower for my Easter buttonhole . In the angle made by the foundation and the sloping cellar door there is a protected place , the earth warmed byp111the furnace and exposed to every scrap of winter sunlight . There white violets grow , brought from the cemetery where they grow wild over the graves of my ancestors . I picked three tiny lion-faced blossoms for my buttonhole and gathereda round dozen for my darling , set their own pale leaves about them for a nosegay , and bound them tight with a bit of aluminum foil from the kitchen . " Why , they 're lovely , " Mary said . " Wait till I get a pin , I 'll wear them . " " They 're the first  --  the very first , my creamy fowl . I amyour slave . Christ is risen . All 's right with the world . " " Please do n't be silly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world have you done with your hair ? " " Do you like it ? " " I love it . Always wear it that way . " " I was n't sure you 'd like it . Margie said you 'd never notice . Wait till I tell her you did . " She set a bowl of flowers on her head , the yearly vernal offering to Eostre . " Like it ? " " I love it . " - flow the young got their inspection , ears , nostrils , shoeshines , every detail , and they resisted every moment of it . Allen 's hair was so plastered that he could hardly blink . The heels of his shoes were unpolished but with infinite care he had trained a line of hair to roll on his crested brow like a summer wave . Ellen was girl of a giriness . All in sight was in order . I tried my luck again . " Ellen , " I said , " you 're doing something different with your hair . It becomes you . Mary , darling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! She 's beginning to take pride , " Mary said . We formed a procession down our path to Elm Street , then left to Porlock , where our church is , our old whitesteepledchurch , stolen intact from Christopher Wren . And we were part of a growing stream , and every woman in passinghad delight of other women 's hats.  | " I have designed an Easter hat , " I said . " A simple , offthe-facecrown of thorns in gold with real ruby droplets on the forehead . " " Ethan ! " said Mary sternly . " Suppose someone should hear you . " " No , I guess it could n't be popular . " " I think you 're horrid , " Mary said , and so did I , worse than horrid . But I did wonder how Mr. Baker would respondto comment on his hair . Our family rivulet joined other streams and passed stately greetings and the stream was a river pouring into St. Thomas 's Episcopal Church , a medium-high church , maybe a little higher than center . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life to my son , which I have no doubt he knows , I must remember to inform him about hair . Armed with a kindly word for hair , he will go as far as his concupiscent little heart desires . I must warn him , however . He may kick , beat , drop , tousle , or bump them , but he must never  --  never  --  mess their hair . With this knowledge he can be king . The Bakers were just ahead of us going up the steps , and we passed decorous greetings . " I believe we 're seeing you at tea . " " Yes , indeed . A very happy Easter to you . " " Can that be Allen ? How he 's grown . And Mary Ellen . Well , I ca n't keep track  --  they shoot up so . " There 's something very dear about a church you grew in . I know every secret corner , secret odor of St. Thomas 's . In that font I was christened , at that rail confirmed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long , and that is no figuic of speech . I must have been deeply printed with the sacredness because I remember every desecration , and there were plenty of them . I think I can go to every place where my initials are scratched with a nail . When Danny Taylor and I punched the letters of a singularly dirty word with a pin in the Book of Common Prayer , Mr.p113Wheeler caught us and we were punished , but they had to go through all the prayerbooks and the hymnals to make sure there were n't more . Once , in that chair stall under the lectern , a dreadful thing happened . I wore the lace and carried the cross and sang a beefy soprano . Once the bishop was officiating , a nice old man , hairless as a boiled onion , but to me glowing with rays of holiness . So it was that , stunned with inspiration , I set the cross in its socket at the end of processional and forgot to throw the brass latch that held it in . At the reading of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross sway and crash on that holy hairless head . The bishop went down like a pole-axed cow and I lost the lace to a boy who could n't sing as well , a boy named Skunkfoot Hill . He 's an anthropologist now , somewhere in the West . The incident seemed to prove to me that intentions , good or bad , are not enough . There 's luck or fate or something else that takes over accidents . We sat the service through and heard the news announcedthat Christ was risen indeed . It ran shivers up my spine as always . I took communion with a good heart . Allen and Mary Ellen were n't yet confirmed and they got pretty restless and had to be given the iron eye to stop their jittering . When Mary 's eyes are hostile , they can pierce even the armor plate of adolescence . Then in the drenching sunshine we shook hands and greeted and shook hands and wished the season 's best to the community of our neighbors . All those we had spoken to coming in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of a continuous litany in the form of decorous good manners , a quiet supplication to be noticed and to be respected . " Good morning . And how are you this fine day ? " " Very well , thank you . How is your mother ? " " She 's getting old  --  getting old  --  the aches and daggers of getting old . 1 ' 11 tell her you asked for her . "  |p114The  words are meaningless except in terms of feeling . Does anyone act as the result of thought or does feeling stimulate action and sometimes thought implement it ? Ahead of our small parade in the sun went Mr. Baker , avoidingstepping on cracks ; his mother , dead these twenty years , was safe from a broken back . And Mrs. Baker , Amelia , tripping along beside him , trying to match his uneven stride with her fluttering feet , a small , bright-eyed bird of a woman , but a seed-eating bird . Allen , my son , walked beside his sister , but each of them tried to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she despises him and he detests her . This may last all their lives while they learn to conceal it in a rose cloud of loving words . Give them their lunches , my sister , my wife  --  their hard-boiled eggs and pickles , their **32;3082;TOOLONG , their red barrel-smelling apples , and turn them free in the world to spawn . And that 's just what she did . They walked away , carryingtheir paper bags , each one to a separate private world . " Did you enjoy the service , my darling ? " " Oh , yes ! I always do . But you  --  sometimes I wonder if you believe  --  no , I mean it . Well , your jokes  --  sometimes  --  " " Pull up your chair , my dimply darling . " " I have to get lunch on . " " Bugger lunch . " " That 's what I mean . Your jokes . " " Lunch is not sacred . If it were warmer , I could carry you to a rowboat and we would go out past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going to the Bakers ' .

Do I lift out each shining phrase from the Nicene creed , loaded like a shotgun shell , and inspect it ? No . Itp115is n't necessary . It 's a singular thing , Mary . If my mind and soul and body were as dry of faith as a navy bean , the words , The Lord is my Shepherd , I shall not want . Ilc makcth me to lie down in green pastures , ' would still make my stomach turn over and put a flutter in my chest and light a fire in my brain . " " I do n't understand . " " Good girl .

" " You say such dreadful things , even to the children . " " And they to me . Ellen , only last night , asked , Daddy , when will we be rich ? ' But I did not say to her what I know : We will be rich soon , and you who handle poverty badly will handle riches equally badly . ' And that is true . In poverty she is envious . In riches she may be a snob . Money does not change the sickness , only the symptoms . " " You talk this way about your own children . What must you say of me ?

You 're wild . " " Do you remember my decorations ? " " Your medals  --  from the war ? " " They were awarded for wildness  --  for wilderness .

" And darned if I did n't go to sleep . Dropped off a cliff into the ( lark , right there in the living room . I do n't do that often . And because I had been thinking of Danny Taylor , I dreamed of Danny Taylor . We were not small or great but grown , and we were at the flat dry lake-bottom with the old house foundations and cellar hole . And it was early summer , for I remarked the fatness of the leaves and the grass so heavy that it bent of its weight , the kind of day that makes you feel fat and crazy too .

" " I had a daymare . I would n't wish a dream like that on anyone . " " It 's all the confusion . Go up and comb your hair and wash your face . You look tired , dear . Are you all right ?

" " But he might want a word alone with you . Businessmen do n't like ladies listening . " " Well , he ca n't have it that way . I want you there . " " You know I have no experience in business . " " I know  --  but it 's your money he 'll be talking about . " You ca n't know people like the Bakers unless you are born knowing them . Acquaintance , even friendship , is a different matter . I know them because Hawleys and Bakers were alike in blood , place of origin , experience , and past fortune . This makes for a kind of nucleus walled and moated against outsiders . When my father lost our money , I was not edged completely out . I am still acceptable as a Hawley to Bakers for perhaps my lifetime because they feel related to me . But I am a poor relation . Gentry without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Allen , my son , will not know Bakers and his son will be an outsider , no matter what his name and antecedents . We have becomeranchers without land , commanders without troops , horsemen on foot . We ca n't survive . Perhaps that is one reason why the change was taking place in me . I do not want , never have wanted , money for itself . But money isp 119necessary to keep my place in a category I am used to and comfortable in . All this must have worked itself out in the dark place below my thinking level . It emerged not as a thought but as a conviction . " Good afternoon , " Mrs. Baker said . " So glad you could come . You 've neglected us , Mary . Has n't it been a glorious day ? Did you enjoy the service ? For a clergyman I think he 's such an interesting man . " " We do n't see you nearly often enough , " Mr. Baker said . " I remember your grandfather sitting in that very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maine . He spilled his tea , only it was n't tea . Old Cap'n Hawley used to lace his rum with a little tea . He was a truculent man , some thought a quarrelsome man . " I could see that Mary was first shaken and then pleased at this warmth . Of course she did n't know I had promoted her to be an heiress . A reputation for money is almost as negotiable as money itself . Mrs. Baker , her head jerking with some nervous disorder , poured tea into cups as thin and fragile as magnolia petals , and her pouring hand was the only steady part of her . Mr. Baker stirred with a thoughtful spoon . " I do n't know whether I love tea or the ceremony of it , " he said . " I like all ceremonies  --  even the silly ones . " " I think I understand , " I said . " This morning I felt comfortable in the service because it had no surprises . I knew the words before they were said . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ladies , and see if you can remember anything like it  --  during the war I served as a consultant to the Secretary of War . I spent some time in Washington . " " I hated it , " said Mrs. Baker . " Well , there was a big military tea , a real doozer , maybe five hundred guests . The ranking lady was the wife of a five-star general and next in importance was the lady ofp120a lieutenant general . Mrs. Secretary , the hostess , asked the five-star lady to pour the tea and Mrs. Three-Stars to pour coffee . Well , the top lady refused because , and I quote her , Everyone knows coffee outranks tea . ' Now , did you ever hear that ? " He chuckled . " As it turned out , whisky outrankedeverybody . " " It was such a restless place , " Mrs. Baker said . " People moved before they had time to gather a set of habits , or manners . " Mary told her story of an Irish tea in Boston with the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with tin ladles . " And they do n't steep . They boil , " she said . " That tea will unsettle varnish on a table . " There must be ritual preliminaries to a serious discussion or action , and the sharper the matter is , the longer and lighter must the singing be . Each person must add a bit of feather or a colored patch . If Mary and Mrs. Baker were not to be a part of the serious matter , they would long since have set up their own pattern of exchange . Mr. Baker had poured wine on the earth of conversation and so had my Mary , and she was pleased and excited by their attentiveness . It remained for Mrs. Baker and for me to contribute and I felt it only decent to be last . She took her turn and drew her source from the teapot as the others had . " I remember when there were dozens of kinds of tea , " she offered brightly . " Why , everyone had recipes for nearly everything . I guess there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was n't made into some kind of tea . Now there are only two , India and China , and not much China . Remember tansy and camomile and orangeleafand flower  --  and  --  and cambric ? " " What 's cambric ? " Mary asked . " Equal parts hot water and hot milk . Children love it . It does n't taste like milk and water . " That accounted for Mrs. Baker.  |p121It  was my turn , and I intended to make a few carefully meaningless remarks about the Boston Tea Party , but you ca n't always do what you intended . Surprises slip out , not waiting for permission . " I went to sleep after service , " I heard me say . " I dreamed of Danny Taylor , a dreadful dream . You rememberDanny . " " Poor chap , " said Mr. Baker . " Once we were closer than brothers . I had no brother . I guess we were brothers in a way . I do n't carry it out , of course , but I feel I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annoyed with me for breaking the pattern of the conversation . She took a small revenge . " Ethan gives him money . I do n't think it 's right . He just uses it to get drunk . " " Wellll ! " said Mr. Baker . " I wonder  --  anyway the dream was a noonmare . I give him so little  --  a dollar now and then . What else can he do with a dollar but get drunk ? Maybe with a decent amount he could get well . " " No one would dare do that , " Mary cried . " That would be after killing him . Is n't that so , Mr. Baker ? " " Poor chap , " Mr. Baker said . " A fine family the Taylors were . It makes me sick to see him this way . But Mary 's right . He 'd probably drink himself to death . " " He is anyway . But he 's safe from me . I do n't have a decent amount to give him . " " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contributed a feminine savagery : " He should be in an institution where they could look after him . " All three were annoyed with me . I should have stayed with the Boston Tea Party . Strange how the mind goes romping , playing blindman 's buff or **26;3116;TOOLONG when it should be using every observation to find a path through the minefield ofp122secret plans and submerged obstacles . I understood the house of Baker and the house of Hawley , the dark walls and curtains , the funereal rubber plants unacquainted with sun ; the portraits and prints and remembrances of other times in pottery and scrimshaw , in fabrics and wood which bolt it to reality and to permanence . Chairs change with style and comfort but chests and tables , bookcases and desks , relate to a solid past . Hawley was more than a family . It was a house . And that was why poor Danny held onto Taylor Meadow . Without it , no family  --  and soon not even a name . By tone and inflection and desire , the three sitting there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ require a house and a history to reassure themselves that they exist  --  it 's a slim enough connection , at most . In the store I was a failure and a clerk , in my house I was Hawley , so I too must be unsure . Baker could offer a hand to Hawley . Without my house , I too would have been canceled . It was not man to man but house to house . I resented the removal from real of Danny Taylor , but I could n't stop it . And this thought sharpened and tempered me . Baker was going to try to refurbish Hawley for Baker 's participation in Mary 's fancied inheritance . Now I was on the edge of the minefield . My heart hardened against my selfless benefactor . I felt it harden and grow wary and dangerous . And with its direction came the feeling of combat , and the laws of controlled savagery , and the first law is : Let even your defense have the appearance of attack . I said , " Mr. Baker , we do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than I do the slow , precise way in which my father lost the Ilawley substance . I was away at war . How did it happen ? " " It was n't his intention , but his judgment  --  " " I know he was unworldly  --  but how did it happen ? " " Well , it was a time of wild investment . He invested wildly . " " Did he have any advice ? "  | " He put money in munitions that were already obsolete . Then when the contracts were canceled , he lost . " " You were in Washington . Did you know about the con-tracts ? " " Only in a general way . " " But enough so you did n't invest . " " No , I did n't . " " Did you advise my father about investments ? " " I was in Washington . " " But you knew he had borrowed the money on the Hawley property , the money to invest ? " " Yes , I knew that . " " Did you advise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " But your bank foreclosed . " " A bank does n't have any choice , Ethan . You know that . " " Yes , I know . Only it 's a shame you could n't have advisedhim . " " You should n't blame him , Ethan . " " Now that I understand it , I do n't . I did n't mean to blame him , but I never quite knew what happened . " I think Mr. Baker had prepared an opening . Having lost his chance , he had to grope about for his next move . He coughed , blew his nose and wiped it with a paper handkerchieffrom a flat pocket package , wiped his eyes with a second sheet , polished his glasses with a third . Everyone has his own method for gaining time . I 've known a man to take five minutes to fill and light a pipe . When he was ready again , I said , " I know I have no right in myself to ask you for help . But you yourself brought up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , " he said . " And usually men of excellent judgment , conservative  --  " " But not blindly so , sir . I believe that once they decided on a course they drove through . "  | " That they did . " " Even if it came to sinking an enemy  --  or burning a ship ? " " They were commissioned , of course . " " In 1801 , I believe , sir , they were questioned about what constituted an enemy . " " There 's always some readjustment after a war . " " Surely . But I 'm not taking up old scores for talk . Frankly , Mr. Baker , I want to  --  to rehabilitate my fortunes . " " That 's the spirit , Ethan . For a time I thought you 'd lost the old Hawley touch . " " I had ; or maybe I 'd not developed it . You 've offered help . Where do I start ? " " The trouble is , you need capital to start . " " I know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I start ? " " This must be tiresome for the ladies , " he said . " Maybe we should go into the library . Business is dull to ladies . " Mrs. Baker stood up . " I was just about to ask Mary to help me select some wallpaper for the big bedroom . The samples are upstairs , Mary . " " I 'd like Mary to hear  --  " But she went along with them , as I knew she would . " I do n't know a thing about business , " she said . " But I do know about wallpaper . " " But you 're concerned , darling . " " I just get mixed up , Ethan . You know I do . " " Maybe I 'll get more mixed up without you , darling . " Mr. Baker had probably suggested the wallpaper bit . I think his wife does not choose the paper . Surely no woman picked the dark and geometric paper in the room where we sat . " Now , " he said when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Your house is clear . You can mortgage it . " I wo n't do that . "  | " Well , I can respect that , but it 's the only collateral you have . There is also Mary 's money . It 's not much , but with some money you can get more money . " " I do n't want to touch her money . That 's her safety . " " It 's in a joint account and it 's not earning anything . " " Let 's say I overcame my scruples . What have you inmind ? " " Have you any idea what her mother 's worth ? " " No  --  but it seems substantial . " He cleaned his glasses with great care . " What I say is bound to be in confidence . " " Of course . " " Fortunately I know you are not a talker . No Hawley ever was , except perhaps your father . Now , I know as a businessman that New Baytown is going to grow . It has everything to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waters . Once it starts , nothing can stop it . A good businessmanowes it to his town to help it develop . " " And take a profit . " " Naturally . " " Why has n't it developed ? " " I think you know that  --  the mossbacks on the council . They 're living in the past . They hold back progress . " It always interested me to hear how philanthropic the taking of a profit can be . Stripped of its forward-looking , good-of-the-community clothing , Mr. Baker 's place was just what it had to be . He and a few others , a very few , would support the town 's present administrations until they had bought or controlled all the future facilities . Then they would turn the council and the Town Manager out and let progress reign , and only then would it be discovered that they owned every avenue through which it could come . From pure sentiment , he was willing to cut me in for a small share . I do n't know whether or not he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether his enthusiasm got the better of him , but it did come through the generalities . Thep126town election is July seventh . By that time , the forwardlookinggroup must have the wheels of progress under control . I do n't suppose there is a man in the world who does n't love to give advice . As I maintained a small reluctance , my teacher grew more vehement and more specific . " I 'll have to think about it , sir , " I said . " What 's easy for you is a mystery to me . And of course I 'll have to discuss it with Mary . " " Now that 's where I think you 're wrong , " he said . " There 's too much petticoat in business today . " " But it 's her inheritance . " " Best thing you can do for her is make her some money for a surprise . They like it better that way . " " I hope I do n't sound ungrateful , Mr. Baker . I think slowly . I 'll just have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to Italy ? " His eyes sharpened . " For good ? " " No , just a visit . " " Well , I hope he makes some arrangement to protect you in case something happened to him . He 's not a young man . Has he made a will ? " " I do n't know . " " If a bunch of his wop relations moved in , you might find yourself out of a job . " I retired into a protective vagueness . " You 've given me a lot to chew on , " I said . " But I wonder if you can give me some little idea of when you will start . " " I can tell you this : Development is pretty much dependent on transportation . " " Well , the big thruways arc moving out . " " Still a long way to conic . The kind of men with the kind of money we want to attract will want to come by air . " " And we have no airport ? " " That 's right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an airport without pushing hills around . " " An expensive operation . The cost of labor would 1 ) c prohibitive . " " Then what is your plan ? " " Ethan , you 'll have to trust me and forgive mc. 1 ca n't tell you that at this time . But I do promise that if you can raise some capital , I 'll see that you get in on the ground floor . And I can tell you that there is a very definite situation , but it has to be solved . " " Well , I guess that 's better than I deserve . " " The old families must stick together . " " Is Marullo part of the group ? " " Certainly not . He goes his own way with his own crowd . " " They do pretty well , do n't they ? " " Better than I think is healthy . I do n't like to see these foreigners creeping in . " " And July seventh is the sound-off . " " Did I say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " " You must have . " And with that Mary came back from the wallpaper . We did our courteous duties and walked slowly toward home . " They just could n't have been nicer . What did he say ? " " Same old thing . I should use your money to get a start , and I wo n't do it . " " I know you 're thinking of me , dear . But I say if you do n't take his advice you 're a fool . " " I do n't like it , Mary . Suppose he 's wrong . You 'd be without protection . " " I tell you this , Ethan , if you do n't do it , I 'll take the money and hand it over to him . I promise you I will . " " Let me think about it . I do n't want to involve you in business . "  | " You do n't have to . That money 's in a joint account . You know what the fortune said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Well , I believe it . " " If I lost your money , you 'd hate me . " " I would n't . You are my fortune ! That 's what Margie said . " " What Margie said , is in my head , in letters red , until I 'm dead . " " Do n't make a joke . " " Maybe I 'm not . Do n't let fortune spoil the sweetness of our failure . " " I do n't see how a little money could spoil anything . Not a lot of money  --  just enough . " I did n't answer . " Well  --  do you ? " I said , " 0 prince 's daughter , there is no such thing as just enough money . Only two measures : No Money and Not Enough Money . " " Why , that 's not true . " " That is true . Remember the Texas billionaire who died recently ? He lived in a hotel room and out of a suitcase . He left no will , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The more you have , the less enough it is . " She said sarcastically , " I suppose you find it sinful for me to want new living-room curtains and a water heater big enough so four people can bathe the same day and I can wash dishes too . " " I was not reporting on sin , you juggins . I was stating a fact , a law of nature . " " You seem to have no respect for human nature . " " Not human nature , my Mary  --  nature . Squirrels bank ten times as many hickory nuts as they can ever use . The pocket gopher , with a stomach full to bursting , still loads his cheeks like sacks . And how much of the honey the clever bees collect do the clever bees eat ? " When Mary is confused or perplexed , she spurts angerp 129the way an octopus spurts ink , and hides in the clark cloud of it . " You make me sick , " she said . " You ca n't let anyone have a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . It 's a despairing unhappiness I 'm afraid of , the panic money brings , the protectiveness and the envy . " She must have been unconsciously fearful of the same thing . She struck at me , probed for a hurting place , and found it and twisted the jagged words . " Here 's a grocery clerk without a bean worried about how bad it will be when he 's rich . You act as though you could pick up a fortune any time you want to . " " I think I can . " " How ? " " That 's the worry . " " You do n't know how or you 'd have done it before . You 're just bluffing . You always bluff . " The intent to wound raises rage . I could feel the fever rise in me . Ugly , desperate words moved up like venom . I felt a sour hatefulness . Mary said , " Look ! There it goes ! Did you see it ? " " Where ? What ? " " Went right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What was it , Mary ? Tell me ! What did you see ? " In the dusk I saw her smile , that incredible female smile . It is called wisdom but it is n't that but rather an understanding that makes wisdom unnecessary . " You did n't see anything , Mary . " " I saw a quarrel  --  but it got away . " I put my arm about her and turned her . " Let 's go around the block before we go in . " We strolled in the tunnel of the night and we did n't speak again , or need to.  |p130As  A CHILD I hunted and killed small creatures with energyand joy . Rabbits and squirrels , small birds , and later ducks and wild geese came crashing down , rumpled distortionsof bone and blood and fur and feathers . There was a savage creativeness about it without hatred or rancor or guilt . The war retired my appetite for destruction ; perhaps I was like a child overindulged in sweets . A shotgun 's blast was no longer a shout of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rabbits paid daily visits to our garden . They loved best my Mary 's carnations , ate them down to raw crowns . " You 'll have to get rid of them , " Mary said . I brought out my 12-bore , sticky with grease , and found some old thickened shells with number five shot . In the evening I sat on the back steps and when the rabbits were in line I blasted both of them with one shot . Then I buried the furry ruins under the big lilac and I was miserable in the stomach . It was simply that I had grown unused to killing things . A man can get used to anything . Slaughtering or undertakingor even execution ; rack and pincers must be just a job when one gets used to it . When the children had gone to bed I said , " I 'm going out for a while . "  |p131Mary  did n't ask where or why , as she would have a few days ago . " Shall you be late ? " " No , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm sleepy , " she said . And it seemed that , having accepted a direction , she was fart her along than I. I still had the rabbit misery . Perhaps it is natural for a man who has destroyed something to try to rest ore a balance by creating something . But was that my impulse ? I fumbled my way into the stinking kennel where Danny Taylor lived . A lighted candle burned in a saucer beside his Army cot . Danny was in bad shape , blue and gaunt and sick . His skin had a pewter sheen . It was hard not to be sick at the smell of the dirty place and the dirty man , under a filthy comforter . His eyes were open and glazed . I expected him to babble in delirium . It was a shock when he spoke clearly and in the tone and manner of Danny Taylor . " What do you want here , Eth ? " " I want to help you . " " You know better than that . " " You 're sick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know it better than anyone . " He groped behind his cot and brought out a bottle of Old Forester one-third full . " Have a shot ? " " No , Danny . That 's expensive whisky . " " I have friends . " " Who gave it to you ? " " That 's none of your business , Eth . " He took a drink and kept it down , but for a moment it was not easy . And then his color came back . He laughed . " My friend wanted to talk business but I fooled him . I passed out before he could get it said . He did n't know how little it takes . Do you want to talk business Eth ? ' Cause I can pass out again quick . " " Do you have any feeling about me , Danny ? Any trust ? Any  --  well , feeling ? "  | " Sure I do , but when it comes right down to it I am a drunk , and a drunk feels strongest about liquor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you go for a cure ? " The frightening thing was how quickly he had become normal and easy and  --  like himself . " I might say I would , Eth . But you do n't know drunks . I 'd take the money and drink it up . " " Well , suppose I paid it right to the hospital , or wher-ever . " " I 'm trying to tell you . I 'd go with the best intentions , and in a few days I 'd get out . You ca n't trust a drunk , Eth . That 's what you ca n't understand . No matter what I did or said  --  I 'd still get out . " " Do n't you want to come out of it , Danny ? " " I guess I do n't . I guess you know what I want . " He hoisted the bottle again , and again I was astonished at the speed of the reaction . Not only did he become the old Danny I knew but his senses and perceptions were sharpened , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do n't trust it , " he said . " It 's only for a little time . Alcohol stimulatesand then depresses . I hope you wo n't stay aroundsee that . Right now , I do n't believe it will happen . I never do when I 'm up . " Then his eyes , wet and shining in the candlelight , looked into me . " Ethan , " he said . " You offered to pay for a cure for me . You have n't the money , Ethan . " " I could get it . Mary inherited some from her brother . " " And you would give me that ? " " Yes . " " Even though I tell you never to trust a drunk ? Even if I assure you I would take your money and break your heart ? " " You 're breaking my heart now , Danny . I had a dream about you . We were out at the old place  --  remember ? " He raised the bottle and then put it down , saying , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never  --  never trust a drunk . When he  --  when I 'm  --  horrible  --  a dead thing  --  there 's still a clever ,  |p133secret  mind at work , and it 's not a friendly mind . Right now , right at this moment , I 'm a man who was your friend . I lied to you about passing out . Oh , I passed out all right , but I know about the bottle . " " Wait , " I said , " before you go any further , else it will look  --  well , you might suspect me . It was Baker brought the bottle , was n't it ? " " Yes . " " He wanted you to sign something . " " Yes , but I passed out . " He chuckled to himself and again lifted the bottle to his lips , but in the candlelight I saw the smallest bubble . He had taken only a drop . " That 's one of the things I wanted to tell you , Danny . Was it the old place he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it happen you have n't sold it ? " " I thought I told you . It makes me a gentleman , lackingonly the conduct of a gentleman . " " Do n't sell it , Danny . Hold onto it . " " What 's it to you ? Why not ? " " For your pride . " " I do n't have any pride left , only position . " " Yes , you have . When you asked me for money , you were ashamed . That means pride . " " No , I told you . That was a trick . Drunks are clever , I tell you . It embarrassed you , and you gave me a buck because you thought I was ashamed . I was n't ashamed . I just wanted a drink . " " Do n't sell it , Danny . It 's valuable . Baker knows it . He does n't buy anything without value . " " What 's valuable about it ? " " It 's the only place nearby level enough for an airfield . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it can be a whole new start for you , Danny . Hold onto it . You could take the cure and when you came out you 'd have a nest egg . "  | " But no nest . Maybe I 'd rather sell it and drink it up and  --  When the bough breaks the cradle will fall , and down will come baby , cradle and all . ' " He sang shrilly and laughed . " Do you want the place , Eth ? Is that why you came here ? " " I want you to be well . " " I am well . " " I want to explain , Danny . If you were a bum , you could be free to do whatever you want . But you have something a group of forward-looking citizens want and need . " " Taylor Meadow . And I 'm going to hold onto it . I 'm forward-looking too . " He glanced affectionately at the bottle . " Danny , I told you , it 's the only place for an airport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have it  --  either that or level the hills , and they ca n't afford that . " " Then I have them by the ying-yang and I 'm going to twist . " " You 've forgotten , Danny . A man of property is a preciousvessel . Already I 've heard that the kindest thing would be to put you in an institution where you would get the care you need . " " They would n't dare . " " Oh , yes they would  --  and feel virtuous about it . You know the process . The judge , you know him , would rule you incompetent to handle property . He would appoint a guardian , and I can guess which one . And all this would be expensive , so of course your property would have to be sold to pay the costs , and guess who would be there to buy it . " His eyes were shiny and he listened with his mouth parted . Now he looked away . " You 're trying to scare mc , Eth . You picked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm cold and the world is green vomit . Right now  --  my strength it is the strength of ten because the bottle 's here . " He waved it like a sword and his eyes went to slits gleaming in the candle/light . " Did I tell you , Eth ? I think I did  --  a drunk has a special evil kind of intelligence . " " But I 've told you what will happen . " " I agree with you . I know it 's true . You 've made your point . But instead of scaring me , you 're roused my imp . Whoever thinks a drunk is helpless is crazy . A drunk is a very special vehicle with special abilities . I can fight back , and right now I seem to want to . " " Good boy ! That 's what I want to hear . " He sighted at me over the neck of the whisky bottle as though it were the bead on the end of a rifle . " You 'd loan me Mary 's money ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes . " " Knowing the chance of getting it back is a thousand to one against ? " " Yes . " " There 's an ugly thing in a drunk , Eth . I do n't believe you . " He licked his dry lips . " Would you put the money in my hands ? " " Whenever you say . " " I 've told you not to . " " But I will . " This time he tipped the bottle back and the big bubble rose inside the glass . When he stopped drinking , his eyes were even shinier but they were cold and impersonal as a snake 's eyes . " Can you get the money this week , Eth ? " " Yes . " " Wednesday ? " " Yes . " " Have you got a couple of bucks now ? " I had just that  --  a dollar bill , a half , a quarter , two dimes and a nickel , and three pennies . I poured them into his outstretchedhand . He finished the bottle and dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you down for clever , Eth . Do you know even a basic cure would cost about a thousand dollars ? " " All right . " " This is fun , Eth . This is n't chess , it 's poker . I used to be pretty good at poker  --  too good . You 're betting I 'll put up my meadow as collateral . And you 're betting that a thousand dollars ' worth of booze will kill me , and there you 'll be with an airport in your lap . " " That 's a nasty thing , Danny . " " I warned you I was nasty . " " Could n't you think I meant it the way I said it ? " " No . But I 've got a way to  --  keep it the way you said it . You remember me in the old days , Eth . Do you think I do n't remember you ? You 're the kid with the built-in judge . Okay . I 'm getting dry . The bottle 's empty . I 'm going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " All right . " " In cash on Wednesday . " " I 'll bring it . " " No note , no signature , no nothing . And do n't think you remember me , Ethan , from the old days . My friend here has changed all that . I have no loyalty , no fairness . What you 'll get is nothing but hearty laughter . " " I would only ask you to try . " " Sure , I 'll promise , Eth . But I hope I 've convinced you what a drunk 's promise is worth . Just bring the cash . Stay as long as you like . My house is your house . I 'm going out . See you Wednesday , Eth . " He eased himself up out of the old Army cot , flung the comforter behind it , and walked out with a rolling gait . His pants were not zipped up . I sat for a while , watching the candle gutter down into the grease of the saucer . Everything he had said was true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had n't changed that much . Somewhere in the wreckage was Danny Taylor . I did n't believe he could amputate Danny . I Mitredp137Danny and I was prepared to  --  do just what he said . I was . From a distance I heard him singing in a clear , high falsetto : " Speed , bonnie boat , like a bird on the wing . Onward ! ' the sailors cry ! Carry the lad that 's born to be kingOver the sea to Skye . " After a lonely while I blew out the candle and walked home by way of High Street . Willie was n't asleep yet in the police car . " Seems to me you 're out a lot , Eth , " he said . " You know how it is . " " Sure . Spring . Young man 's fancy . " Mary was asleep , smiling , but when I slipped in beside her , she half awakened . The misery was in my stomach  --  the cold , hurting misery . Mary turned on her side and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . I knew the misery would get less , but right now I needed her . I do n't know whether she really awakened but even sleeping she knew my need . And afterward she was awake and she said , " I suppose you 're hungry . " " Yes , Helen . " " What do you want ? " " Onion sandwich  --  no , two onion sandwiches on rye bread . " " I 'll have to have one to stand you . " " Do n't you want one ? " " Of course . " She padded down the stairs and came back in a little while with sandwiches and a carton of milk and two glasses . It was a pretty hot onion . " Mary , muldoon , " I began . " Wait till you swallow . " " Did you mean that about not wanting to know about business ? "  | " Why  --  yes . " " Well , I have a lead . I want a thousand dollars . " " Was it something Mr. Baker told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . " " Well , you just write a check . " " No , darling , I want you to get it in cash . And you might pass the word at the bank that you 're getting new furniture or rugs or something . " " But I 'm not . " " You will . " " Is it a secret ? " " You said you wanted it that way . " " Yes  --  well  --  I do . Yes . It 's better that way . This is a burny onion . Would Mr. Baker approve ? " " He would if he did it . " " When do you want it ? " " Tomorrow . " " I ca n't eat this onion . I guess I smell bad enough now , though . " " You 're my darling . " " I ca n't get over Marullo . " " How do you mean ? " " Coming to the house . Bringing candy . " " God works in a mysterious way . " " Now do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes ' t is . It 's one-fifteen . " " Good Lord ! We better get to sleep . " " Ah ! There 's the rub  --  Shakespeare . " " You 'd make a joke about anything . " But it was no joke . The misery stayed , not thought about but aching away , and sometimes I would have to ask myself , Why do I ache ? Mcn can get used to anything , but it takes time . Once long ago I took a job wheeling nitroglycerin in a dynamite plant . The pay was high because the stuff is tricky . At first I worried with every step I took , but in a week ) or so it was only a job . Why , I 'd even got used to being a groceryp139clerk . There 's something desirable about anything you 're used to as opposed to something you 're not . In the dark with the red spots swimming in my eyes , I inquired of myself concerning what they used to call matters of conscience , and I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my course , I could change direction or even reversethe compass ninety degrees and I thought I could but I did n't want to . I had a new dimension , and I was fascinated with it . It was like discovering an unused set of muscles or having come true the child 's dream that I could fly . Often I can replay events , scenes , conversations , and pick up from the repeat details which escaped me at first showing . Mary found strangeness in Marullo 's coming to the house with candy eggs , and I trust Mary 's sense of strangeness . I had thought of it as a thank offering because I had not cheated him . But Mary 's question made me reinspect for something I knew but had passed by . Marullo did not rewardfor things past ; he bribed for things to come . He was not interested in me except in so far as I could be of use to him . I went back over his business instruction and the talk about Sicily . Somewhere he had lost his certainty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed something . There was a way to find out . If I should ask for something he would ordinarily refuse and get it from him , then I would know that he was off balance and deeply troubled . I put Marullo aside and went to Margie . Margie  --  that gives you an idea of her age . " Margie , I 'm always dreaming of you , Margie . I 'd give the world to . .. " I replayed the Margie scenes against the swimming spots on the ceiling , trying to add no more than was really there . For a long time , maybe two years , there had been a Mrs. Young-Hunt who was a friend of my wife , part of the conversationsI did not listen to . Then suddenly Margie YoungHunthad emerged , and then Margie . She must have come to the store before Good Friday , but I could not rememberp140it . On that day it was as though she announced herself . Beforethat it is possible that she did n't see me any more than I saw her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mover and a shaker . What did she want ? Could it be pure mischief of a woman with too little to do ? Or did she move to a plan ? It did seem to me that she had announced herself to me  --  made me conscious of her and kept me aware of her . It seemed to me that she started the second fortune-telling in good faith , intending it to be the usual performance , polishedand professional . Then something happened , something that tore it up . Mary had said nothing to cause her tension , nor had I. IIad she really seen the vision of the snake ? That would be the simplest explanation and probablythe true one . Maybe she was truly intuitive , an intruderinto the minds of others . The fact that she had caught me midway in a metamorphosis made me likely to believe this , but it could have been an accident . But what made her run to Montauk when she had not intended to go , join up with the drummer , spill the beans to Marullo ? Somehow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intend to spill . Somewhere in the attic bookcases there was an account of the life of  --  was it Bering ? No , Baranov , AlexanderBaranov , the Russian governor somewhere near i800 . Maybe there would be some reference to Alaska as a prison for witches . It was too unlikely a story to be made up . I must look . I thought maybe I could creep up there now without waking Mary . Then I heard a creak of the old oak stair treads , then a second and a third , so I knew it was not a settling of the house from a change of temperature . It had to be Ellen walking in her sleep . Of course I love my daughter , but sometimes she frightens me for she seems to have been born clever , at once jealous and loving . She was always jealous of her brother and often I feel she is jealous of me . It seemed to me that herp141preoccupation with sex began very early . Maybe fathers always feel this . When she was a very little girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she went into the secrecy of change . Here was no angelic innocent girlhood of the magazines . The house boiled with nervousness , the walls vibrated with unease . I 've read that iii the Middle Ages pubescent girls were thought to be susceptible to witchcraft and I 'm not sure it is not so . For a time we had what we called as a joke a poltergeist . Pictures fell from their hangings , dishes crashed to the floor . There were poundings in the attic and thumpings in the cellar . I do n't know what caused it , but I was interested enough to keep my eye on Ellen , on her secret comings and goings . She was like a night cat . I satisfied myself that she was not responsiblefor the fallings and crashings and thumpings , but also I found they never happened when she was out of the house . She might be sitting staring into space when the poltergeist came , but she was always there . As a child I remember hearing that the old Hawley house was haunted long ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to accounts , he was a decent ghost who walked and wandered and groaned as he should . The stairs creaked under his invisible weight and he rapped on the wall when a death was imminent , all proper and in good taste . The poltergeist was something quite different  --  malicious , malignant , and mischievous and vengeful . He never broke a valueless thing . Then he went away . I never really believed in him . He was a family joke , except that there he was and there were the broken pictures and shatteredchina . When he left , Ellen began walking in her sleep as she was now . I could hear her slow but certain footsteps going downstairs . And at the same time my Mary sighed deeply and murmured beside me . And a breeze sprang up and moved the shadows of leafing limbs on the ceiling.  |p142I  slipped quietly from bed and slid into my bathrobe , for I , like everyone else , believed that a sleepwalker should not be startled awake . This sounds as though I did n't like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I am somewhat in fear of her because I do n't understand her . If you use our stairs near the edge on the side of the wall , they do not creak . I discovered that as a tomcatting boy coming home from the back fences of the town . I still use the knowledge if I do not want to disturb Mary . I used it now  --  moved silently down the staircase , trailing my fingers against the wall for guidance . A dim and lacy sublight penetratedfrom the street-lamp side and dissipated to semidarknessaway from the window . But I could see Ellen . She seemed to have a glow , perhaps her white nightgown . Her face was shadowed but her arms and hands picked up light . She was standing at the glass-fronted cabinet where the worthless family treasures are kept , the carved scrimshaw , the sperm whales and boats complete with oars and irons and crews , harpooner in the bow  --  all carved from whales ' bone  --  like teeth and the curved tusks of walrus ; a small model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sails and cordage brown and dusty . There were bits of the chinoiseriethe old captains brought from the Orient after they had stripped the China area of sperm whales , bits and pieces , ebony and ivory , laughing and serious gods , Buddhas , serene and dirty , carved flowers in rose quartz and soapstone and some jade  --  yes , some good jade  --  and thin cups , translucentand lovely . Some of the things might be valuable  --  like the small shapeless horses which yet had life  --  but if they were valuable it was an accident , must have been . How would those sailing , whale-killing men know good from bad  --  or would they ? Or did they ? The cabinet had always been the holy place of the parenti to me  --  Roman masks of the ancestors , or the lares and penates back to a stone fallen from the moon . We even hadp143a mandrake root  --  a perfect little man , sprouted from the death-ejected sperm of a hanged man , and also we had a veritable mermaid , pretty ratty by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a monkey and the after end of a fish together . It had shrunk with the years and the stitches showed , but its little teeth still showed in a ferocious smile . I presume that every family has a magic thing , a continuitything that inflames and comforts and inspires from generation to generation . Ours was a  --  how shall I say ?  --  a kind of mound of translucent stone , perhaps quartz or jadeite or even soapstone . It was circular , four inches in diameterand an inch and a half at its rounded peak . And carved on its surface was an endless interweaving shape that seemed to move and yet went no place . It was living but had no head or tail , nor beginning or end . The polished stone was not slick to the touch but slightly tacky like flesh , and it was always warm to the touch . You could see into it and yet not through it . I guess some old seaman of my blood had brought it back from China . It was magic  --  good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheek or to caress with your fingers . This strange and magic mound lived in the glass cabinet . As child and boy and man I was allowed to touch it , to handle it , but never to carry it away . And its color and convolutions and texture changed as my needs changed . Once I supposed it was a breast , to me as a boy it became yoni , inflamed and aching . Perhaps later it evolved to brain or even enigma , the headless , endless , moving thing  --  the question which is whole within itself , needing no answer to destroy it , no beginning or end to limit it . The glass case had a brass lock from colonial times and a square brass key , always in the lock . My sleeping daughter had the magic mound in her hands , caressing it with her fingers , petting it as though it were alive . She pressed it against her unformed breast , placed it on her cheek below her ear , nuzzled it like a suckling puppy , and she hummed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was destruction in her . I had been afraid at first that she might want to crash it to bits or hide it away , but now I saw that it was mother , lover , child , in her hands . I wondered how I might awaken her without fright . But why are sleepwalkers awakened ? Is it for fear that they may hurt themselves ? I 've never heard of injury in this state , exceptthrough awakening . Why should I interfere ? This was no nightmare full of pain or fear but rather pleasure and association beyond waking understanding . What call had I to spoil it ? I moved quietly back and sat down in my big chair to wait . The dim room seemed swarming with particles of brilliantlight moving and whirling like clouds of gnats . I guess they were not really there but only prickles of weariness swimming in the fluid of my eyes , but they were very convincing . And it did seem true that a glow came from my daughter Ellen , not only from the white of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see her face and I should not have been able to in the darkened room . It seemed to me that it was not a little girl 's face at all  --  nor was it old , but it was mature and complete and formed . Her lips closed firmly , which they did not normally do . After a time Ellen put the talisman firmly and precisely back in its place and she closed the glass-fronted case and twisted the brass key that kept it closed . Then she turned and walked past my chair and up the stairs . Two things I may have imagined  --  one , that she did not walk like a child but like a fulfilled woman , and second , that as she went the luminescence drained away from her . These may be impressions , children of my mind , but a third thing is not . As she ascended the stairs , there was no creak of wood . She must have been walking near to the wall , where the treads do not complain . In a few moments I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and properly covered . She breathed through her mouth and her face was a sleeping child 's face.  |p145On  compulsion I went down the stairs again and opened the glass case . I took the mound in my hands . It was warm from Ellen 's body . As I had done in childhood , I traced the endless flowing form with my forefingertip and I took comfortin it . I felt close to Ellen because of it . I wonder , did the stone bring her somehow close to me to the Hawleys ?  |p146ON  MONDAY perfidious spring dodged back toward winter with cold rain and raw gusty wind that shredded the tender leaves of too trusting trees . The bold and concupiscent bull sparrows on the lawns , intent on lechery , got blown about like rags , off course and off target , and they chattered wrathfullyagainst the inconstant weather . I greeted Mr. Red Baker on his tour , his tail blown sidewayslike a battle flag . He was an old acquaintance , squintinghis eyes against the rain . I said , " From now on you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I feel it only right to tell you that our smiles conceal a savage contest , a conflict of interests . " I could have said more but he was anxious to finish his chores and get under cover . The Morph was on time . He may have been waiting for me  --  probably was . " Hell of a day , " he said , and his oiledsilkraincoat flapped and billowed around his legs . " I hear you did a social turn with my boss . " " I needed some advice . He gave me tea too . " " He 'll do that . " " You know how advice is . You only want it if it agrees with what you wanted to do anyway . " " Sounds like investment . " " My Mary wants some new furniture . When a womanp 147wants something she first dresses it up as a good invest-ment . " " Not only women , either , " said Morph . " I do it myself . " " Well , it 's her money . She wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of High Street we watched a tin sign tear loose from Rapp 's Toy Store and go skidding and screeching along , sounding like a traffic accident . " Say , I heard your boss is going to make a trip home to Italy . " " I do n't know . Seems odd to me he never went before . Those families are awful close . " " Got time for a cup of coffee ? " " I ought to get swept out . Should be a busy morning after the holiday . " " Oh , come on ! Live big . The personal friend of Mr. Baker can afford time for a cup of coffee . " He did n't say it meanly the way it looks in print . He could make anything sound innocent and well-intentioned . In all the years I had never gone into the Foremaster Grill for a cup of coffee in the morning and I was probably the only man in town who did n't . It was a custom , a habit , and a club . We climbed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to school with her , slid coffee to us without spilling any in the saucer . A tiny bottle of cream leaned against the cup but she rolled two paper-wrapped cubes of sugar like dice so that Morph cried out , " Snake eyes . " Miss Lynch  --  Miss Lynch . The " miss ' was part of her name by now , and part of herself . I guess she will never be able to excise it . Her nose gets redder every year , but it 's sinus , not booze . " Morning , Ethan , " she said . " You celebrating some-thing ? " " He dragged me in , " I said , and then as an experiment in kindness , " Annie . "  |p148Her  head snapped around as though at a pistol shot and then , as the idea got through , she smiled and , do you know , she looked exactly as she had in the fifth grade , red nose and all . " It 's good to see you , Ethan , " she said and wiped her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , I was surprised , " Morph said . He picked at the paper on the sugar cube . His nails were polished . " You get an idea and then it 's fixed and you think it 's true . Gives you a turn when it 's not . " " I do n't know what you 're talking about . " " I guess I do n't either . Goddam these wrappers . Why ca n't they just put it loose in a bowl ? " " Maybe because people might use more . " " I guess so . I knew a guy once lived . on sugar for a while . He 'd go in the Automat . Ten cents for a cup of coffee , drink half , fill it up with sugar . At least he did n't starve to death . " As usual , I wondered if that guy was n't Morph  --  a strange one , tough , ageless man with a manicure . I think he was a fairly well-educated man , but only because of his processes , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dialect , a language of the bright , hard , brassy illiterate . " Is that why you use one lump of sugar ? " I asked . He grinned . " Everybody 's got a theory , " he said . " I do n't care how beat a guy is , he 'll have a theory why he 's beat . A theory can lead you down the garden path ' cause you 'll followit in spite of road signs . I guess that 's what fooled me about your boss . " I had n't had coffee away from home in a long time . It was n't very good . It did n't taste like coffee at all but it was hot , and I spilled some on my shirt , so I know it was also brown . " I guess I do n't know what you mean . " " I been trying to track where I got the idea . I guess it 's because he says he 's been here forty years . Thirty-five years or thirty-seven years , okay , but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not too bright . " " That would make it 1920 . You still do n't dig it ? Well , in a bank you 've got to case people quick , check hustlers , you know . Pretty soon you get a built-in set of rules . You do n't even think about it . It just clicks into place -- and you can be wrong . Maybe he did come in 1920 . I could be wrong . " I finished my coffee . " Time to sweep out , " I said . " You fool me too , " Morph said . " If you asked questions I 'd be hard to get . But you do n't , so I got to tell you . Nineteentwenty-one was the first emergency immigration law . " " And ? " " In 1920 he could come in . In 1921 he probably could n't . " " And ? " " So  --  anyway my weasel brain says  --  he came in after 1921 by the back door . So he ca n't go home because he ca n't get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm glad I 'm not a banker . " " You 'd probably be better than I am . I talk too much . If he 's going back , I 'm real wrong . Wait up  --  I 'm coming . Coffee 's on me . " " ' By , Annie , " I said . " Come in again , Eth . You never come in . " " I will . " As we crossed the street Morph said , " Do n't let on to his guinea eminence that I pulled a blooper about him being deportation bait , will you ? " " Why should I ? " " Why did I ? What 's in that jewel case ? " " Knight Templar 's hat . Feather 's yellow . Going to see if it can be whited up . " " You belong to that ? " " It 's in the family . We been Masons since before George Washington was Grand Master . " " He was ? Does Mr. Baker belong ? "  | " It 's in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Morph fished for the key to the bank 's back door . " Maybe that 's why we open the safe like a lodge meeting . Might as well be holding candles . It 's kind of holy . " " Morph , " I said . " you 're full of bull this morning . Easter did n't clean you up at all . " " I 'll know in eight days , " he said . " No , I mean it . Comes nine o'clock on the nose we stand uncovered in front of the holy of holies . Then the time lock springs and Father Baker genuflects and opens the safe and we all bow down to the Great God Currency . " " You 're nuts , Morph . " " Maybe so . Goddam this old lock . You could open it with an ice pick but not with the key . " He jiggled the key and kicked at the door until it finally burst open . He took a piece of Kleenex from his pocket and jammed it into the spring lock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is n't that dangerous ? He answered without the question . " Damn thing wo n't lock itself open . Course Baker checks to see it 's locked after the safe 's open . Do n't blow my dirty suspicions to Marullo , will you ? He 's too solvent . " " Okay , Morph , " I said and turned to my own door on my own side of the alley , and looked around for the cat that always tried to get in , but he was n't there . Inside , the store looked changed and new to me . I saw things I had never seen before and did n't see things that had worried and irritated me . And why not ? Bring new eyes to a world or even new lenses , and presto  --  new world . The leaky valve of the old box toilet hissed softly . Marullowould n't get a new valve because the water was n't metered and who cared . I went to the front of the store and lifted a slotted two-pound weight from the old-fashioned balance scale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chain above the oaken tassel . The toilet flushed and kept on flush/ing . I went back to the front of the store to listen and could hear it bubbling and scolding in the bowl . It 's a sound you ca n't mistake for anything else . Then I returned the weight to its bar on the scale and took my place in my pulpit behind the counter . My congregation in the shelves stood waiting . Poor devils , they could n't get away . I particularly noticed the Mickey Mouse mask smiling down from its box in the pew of breakfast foods . That reminded me of my promise to Allen . I found the extension hand for grabbing things from top shelves and took a box down and stood it under my coat in the storeroom . When I was back in the pulpit , the next Mickey Mouse in line smiled down at me . I reached behind the canned goods and brought out the gray linen sack of small change for the cash register , then , remembering something , reached farther until my hand found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since I can remember . It was a silvered Iver Johnson with most of the silver peeled off . I broke it and saw the cartridges green with verdigris . The cylinder was so sluggish with ancient grease that it turned with difficulty . I put the disreputable and probably dangerous piece in the drawer below the cash register , pulled out a clean apron , and wrapped it around my middle , folding the top over neatly to conceal the strings . Is there anyone who has not wondered about the decisionsand acts and campaigns of the mighty of the earth ? Are they born in reasoning and dictated by virtue or can some of them be the products of accidents , of daydreaming , of imagining , of the stories we tell ourselves ? I know exactly how long I had been playing a game of imagining because I know it started with the Morph 's rules for successful bank robbery . I had gone over his words with a childish pleasure adults ordinarily will not admit . It was a play game that ran parallel with the store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place in the game . The leaking toilet , the Mickey Mouse mask Allen wanted , the account of the open/ing of the safe . New curves and angles dropped into place , the Kleenex nudged in the door lock in the alley . Little by little the game grew , but entirely in the mind until this morning . Putting the scale weight on the toilet chain was the first physical contribution I had made to the mental ballet . Getting the old pistol out was the second . And now I began to wonder about the timing . The game was growing in precision . I still carry my father 's big silver Hamilton railroad watch with thick hands and big black numbers , a wonderful watch for time-telling , if not for beauty . This morning I put it in my shirt pocket before I swept out the store . And I checked the time so that at five minutes to nine I had the front doors open and had just taken the first deliberate broom strokes at the sidewalk . It 's amazing how much dirt accumulates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dirt was slush . What a wonderful precision instrument is our bank  --  like my father 's railroad watch . At five minutes of nine Mr. Baker came into the wind from Elm Street . Harry Robbit and Edith Alden must have been watching . They backed out of the Foremaster Grill and joined him midstreet . " Morning , Mr. Baker , " I called . " Morning , Edith . Morning , Harry . " " Good morning , Ethan . You 're going to need a hose for that ! " They entered the bank . I leaned my broom in the store entrance , took the weight from the scale , went behind the cash register , opened the drawer , and went through fast but deliberate pantomime . I walked to the storeroom , hung the weight on the toilet chain . Hooked the skirt of my apron over the belly band , put on my raincoat , and stepped to the back door and opened it a crack . As the black minute hand of my watch crossed twelve the clock bell of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alley and then in my mind twenty steps . I moved my hand but not my lips  --  allowed ten seconds , moved my hand again . All this I saw in myp 153mind  --  I counted while my hands made certain movements  --  twenty steps , quick but deliberate , then eight more steps . I closed the alley door , took off my raincoat , unhooked my apron , went into the toilet , took the weight off the chain and stopped the flushing , moved back of the counter , opened the drawer , opened my hatbox and closed and strapped it , went back to the entrance , took up my broom , and looked at the watch . It was two minutes and twenty seconds past nine o'clock ; pretty good , but with a little practiceit could be cut under two minutes . I was only half finished with the sidewalk when Stoney , the chief constable , came across from the Foremaster Grill . " Morning , Eth . Gim me a quick half-pound of butter , pound of bacon , bottle of milk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of everything . " " Sure thing , Chief . How 's everything ? " I got the things together and snapped open a bag . " Okay , " he said . " I come by a minute ago but I heard you was in the can . " " It 'll take me a week to get over all those hard-boiled eggs . " " That 's the truth , " said Stoney . " Man 's got to go , he 's got to go . " So that was all right . As he was about to leave , he said , " What 's with your friend , Danny Taylor ? " " I do n't know  --  is he on one ? " " No , he looked pretty good , fairly clean . I was sitting in the car . He had me witness his signature . " " For what ? " " I do n't know . Had two papers but turned back so I could n't see . " " Two papers ? " " Yeah , two . He signed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sober ? " " Seemed like . Had his hair cut and a necktie on . "  | " I wish I could believe it , Chief . " " So do I. Poor fella . I guess they never stop trying . I got to get home . " And he galloped away . Stoney 's wife is twenty years younger than he is . I went back and brushed the larger pieces of filth off the sidewalk . I felt lousy . Maybe the first time is always hard . I was right about the heavy custom . It seemed to me that everybody in town had run out of everything . And since our deliveries of fruits and vegetables did n't come in until about noon , the pickings were pretty slim . But even with what we had , the customers kept me jumping . Marullo came in about ten o'clock and for a wonder he gave me a hand , weighing and wrapping and ringing up money on the cash register . He had n't helped around the store for a long time . Mostly he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like an absentee landlord . But this morning he helped to open the crates and boxes of fresh stuff when it came in . It seemed to me that he was uneasy and that he studied me when I was n't looking . We did n't have time to talk but I could feel his eyes on me . I thought it must be hearing that I had refused the bribe . Maybe Morph was right . A certain kind of man , if he hears you have been honest , probes for the dishonesty that prompted it . The **27;3144;TOOLONG ? attitude must be particularlystrong in men who play their own lives like a poker hand . The thought gave me a little chuckle but a deep one that did n't even raise a bubble to the surface . About eleven o'clock , my Mary came in , shining in a new cotton print . She looked pretty and happy and a little breathless , as though she had done a pleasant but dangerous thing  --  and she had . She gave me a brown manila envelope . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She smiled at Marullo the bright birdlike way she does when she does n't really like someone . And she did n't like or trust Marullo  --  never had . I always put it down to the fact that a wife never likes her husband 's boss or his secretary. p 155I said , " Thank you , dear . You 're very thoughtful . Sorry I ca n't take you for a boat ride on the Nile right now . " " You are busy , " she said . " Well , did n't you run out of everything ? " " Sure I did . Here , I 've got a list . Will you bring things home tonight ? I know you 're too rushed to put them up now . " " But no hard-boiled eggs  --  " " No , darling . Not for a whole year . " " Those Easter bunnies were sure busy . " " Margie wants to take us to dinner at the Foremaster tonight . She says she never gets to entertain us . " " Fine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too small . " " Is it ? " " I 'm keeping you from your work , " she said . Marullo 's eyes were on the brown envelope in my hand . I put it up under my apron and stuffed it in my pocket . He knew it was a bank envelope . And I could feel his mind hunting like a terrier after rats in a city dump . Mary said , " I did n't get a chance to thank you for the candy , Mr. Marullo . The children loved it . " " Just good wishes of the Easter , " he said . " You dress like springtime . " " Why , thank you . I got wet too . I thought the rain was over , but it came back . " " Take my raincoat , Mary . " " I would n't think of it . It 's just a shower now . You get back to your customers . " The pace got worse . Mr. Baker looked in and saw the line of people waiting and went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he called . And still they came , right up until noon , and then , as usually happens , all custom stopped . People were eating lunch . The traffic died out in the street . For the first time all morning no one was wanting something . I drank morep156milk from the carton I had opened . Anything I took from the store I marked down and just deducted it from my pay . Marullo let me have things wholesale . It makes a big difference . I do n't think we could have lived on my pay if he had n't . He leaned back against the counter and folded his arms and that hurt , so he shoved his hands in his pockets until that hurt . I said , " I 'm sure glad you helped out . Never saw such a rush . But I guess they ca n't go on living on left-over potato salad . " " You do a nice job , kid . " " I do a job . " " No , they come back . They like you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've been here forever . " And then I tried a little tiny probe . " I 'll bet you 're looking forward to that hot Sicilian sun . It is hot in Sicily . I was there in the war . " Marullo looked away . " I do n't make my mind yet . " " Why not ? " " Well , I been away so long time  --  forty years . I do n't know nobody there . " " But you have relatives . " " They do n't know me neither . " " I sure wish I could take a vacation in Italy  --  without a rifle and a field pack . Forty years is a long time , though . What year did you come over ? " " Nineteen twenty  --  long time ago . " Morph seemed to have hit it on the nose . Maybe bankers and cops and customs men get an instinct . Then another , maybe a little deeper probe came to my mind . I opened the drawer and took out the old revolver and tossed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " What you got there , kid ? " " I just thought you ought to get a permit for it if you have n't got one . The Sullivan Act is a tough one . "  | " Where 'd it come from ? " " It 's been here all along . " " I never saw it . It do n't belong to me . It 's yours . " " Not mine . I never saw it before either . It 's got to belong to somebody . Long as it 's here do n't you think you better apply for a permit ? You sure it 's not yours ? " " I tell you I never saw it . I do n't like guns . " " That 's funny . I thought all big Mafia men loved em . " How you mean , Mafia ? You trying to say I 'm Mafia ? " I made a big innocent joke about it . " The way I heard it , all Sicilians belong to Mafia . " " That 's crazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tossed the gun into the drawer . " Live and learn ! " I said . " Well , I sure do n't want it . Maybe I better turn it over to Stoney . Tell him I just came on it behind something , because that 's what I did . " " You do that , " said Marullo . " I never saw it in my life . I do n't want it . It 's not mine . " " Okay , " I said . " Out it goes . " It takes quite a few documents to get a Sullivan Act permit  --  almost as many as to get a passport . My boss had ants . Maybe too many small things had happenedtoo close together . The elderly Miss Elgar , the princess royal of New Baytown , came in close-hauled , with a set jib . Between Miss Elgar and the world were two plates of safety glass , a space between . She negotiated for a dozen eggs . Having known me as a little boy , she never thought of me as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pleased that I could make change . " I thank you , Ethan , " she said . Her eyes slid over the coffee-grinder and over Marullo and gave equal attention to each . " How 's your father , Ethan ? " " Fine , Miss Elgar , " I said . " Give him my greetings , that 's a good boy . "  | " Yes , ma'am . I surely will , ma'am . " I was n't about to reregulate her time sense . They say she still winds the grandfatherclock every Sunday night and it has been electrified for years . It would n't be bad to be that way , suspended in time  --  not bad at all , an endless afternoon of now . She nodded gravely to the coffee-grinder before she left . " Crazy in the head , " Marullo said and screwed his forefingerinto his temple . " Nobody changes . Nobody gets hurt . " " Your father is dead . Why do n't you tell her he 's dead ? " " If she 'd believed me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . It 's not so long ago she stopped inquiring after my grandfather . She was his friend , they say , the old goat . " " Crazy in the head , " Marullo observed . But for some reasonhaving to do with Miss Elgar 's unusual feeling about time , he had got hold of himself . It 's hard to know how simple or complicated a man is . When you become too sure , you 're usually wrong . I think , from habit and practice , Marullohad reduced his approaches to men to three : command , flattery , and purchase . And the three must have worked often enough to allow him to depend on them . Somewhere in his dealing with me he had lost the first . " You 're a good kid , " he said . " You 're a good friend too . " " Old Cap'n , he was my grandfather , used to say , If you want to keep a friend never test him . ' " " That 's smart . " " He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , kid  --  even in church I was thinking . " I knew he had been worried about the kickback , at least I thought he had , so I jumped it out to save him time . " About that fine present , huh ? " " Yeah . " He looked at me with admiration . " You 're smart too . " " Not smart enough to be working for myself . " " You been here how long  --  twelve years ? "  | " That 's it  --  too long . ' Bout time for a change , do n't you think ? " " And you never took none of the petty cash and you never took nothing home without you wrote it down . " " Honesty is a racket with me . " " Do n't make no joke . What I say is true . I check . I know . " " You may pin the medal on my left lapel . " " Everybody steals  --  some more , some less  --  but not you . I know ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Do n't make jokes . What I say is true . " " Alfio , you 've got a jewel . Do n't polish me too much . The paste may show through . " " Why do n't you be partners with me ? " " On what ? My salary ? " " We work it out some way . " " Then I could n't steal from you without robbing myself . " He laughed appreciatively . " You 're smart , kid . But you do n't steal . " " You did n't listen . Maybe I plan to take it all . " " You 're honest , kid . " " That 's what I 'm telling you . When I 'm most honest , nobody believes me . I tell you , Alfio , to conceal your motives , tell the truth . " " What kind of talk you do ? " " Ars est celare artem . " He moved his lips over that and then broke into a laugh . " Ho , " he cried . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Want a cold Coke ? " " No good for here ! " He flung his arms across his abdomen . " You are n't old enough for a bad stomach , not over fifty . " " Fifty-two , and I got a bad stomach . " " Okay , " I said . " Then you came over at twelve if it was 1920 . I guess they start Latin early in Sicily . "  | " I was choirboy , " he said . " I used to carry the cross in the choir myself . I 'm going to have a Coke . Alfio , " I said , " you work out a way for me to buy in here and I 'll look at it . But I warn you , I do n't have money . " " We work it out . " " But I 'm going to have money . " His eyes were on my face and could n't seem to remove themselves . And Marullo said softly , " Io lo credo . " Power but not of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tipping it back , looked down its brown barrel at Marullo 's eyes . " You 're a good kid , " he said and he shook my hand and wandered away , out of the store . On an impulse I called after him , " How does your arm feel ? " He turned with a look of astonishment . " It do n't hurt no more , " he said . And he went on and repeated the words to himself , " It do n't hurt no more . " He came back excitedly . " You got to take that dough . " " What dough ? " " That five per cent . " Why ? " . " You got to take it . You can buy in with me a little and a little , only hold out for six per cent . " " No . " " What you mean no , if I say yes ? " " I wo n't need it , Alfio . I 'd taken it if I needed to , but I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't as busy as the morning , but it was n't light either . There 's always a slack time between three and four  --  usually twenty minutes to half an hour , I do n't know why . Then it picks up again , but that 's people going home from work and wives whomping up a last-ditch dinner.  |p161In  the slack period Mr. Baker came in . He waited , regardingthe cheese and sausage in the cold chamber , until the store was clear of two customers , both sloppy shoppers , the kind who do n't know what they want , the kind who pick up and put down , hoping that something will jump into their arms and demand to be bought . At last the shoppers were finished and gone . " Ethan , " he said , " did you know Mary drew out a thousand dollars ? " " Yes , sir . She told me she was going to . " " Do you know what she wants it for ? " " Sure , sir . She 's been talking about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furniture gets a little worn , but just the minute they decide to get new , the old stuff is just impossible . " " Do n't you think it 's foolish to spend it now on that kind of stuff ? I told you yesterday there was going to be an opening . " " It 's her money , sir . " " I was n't talking about gambling , Ethan . I was talking about sure-fire investment . I believe with that thousand she could get her furniture in a year and still have a thousand . " " Mr. Baker , I ca n't very well forbid her to spend her own money . " " Could n't you persuade her , could n't you reason with her ? " " It never occurred to me . " " That sounds like your father , Ethan . That sounds wishywashy . If I 'm going to help you get on your feet I ca n't have you wishy-washy . " " Well , sir . " " And it is n't like she was going to spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the discount houses and pay cash . There 's no telling what she 'll pick up . Local man might charge more but he 'd be here if she got a lemon . You should put your foot down , Ethan . Try to get her to rede/posit it ! Or you tell her to put the money in my hands . She 'll never regret it . " " It 's money her brother left her , sir . " " I know that . I tried to reason with her when she drew it . She just turned blue-eyed vague  --  said she wanted to look around . Ca n't she look around without a thousand dollars in her pocket ? You ought to know better , if she does n't . " " I guess I 'm out of practice , Mr. Baker . ' We have n't had any money since we were married . " " Well , you 'd better learn and learn quick or you wo n't have any very long . The spending habit is like a dope with some women . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the habit , sir . " " Well , she will . Just let her taste blood and she 'll turn killer . " " Mr. Baker , I do n't think you mean that . " " I do too . " " There 's never been a more careful wife with money . She 's had to be . " For some reason he had worked up a storm . " It 's you I 'm disappointed in , Ethan . If you 're going to get any place you 've got to be the boss in your own house . You could hold off new furniture another little while . " " I could , but she ca n't . " The thought came to me that maybe bankers develop X-ray eyes for money , that maybe he could see the envelope through my clothes . " I 'll try to reason with her , Mr. Baker . " " If she has n't spent it already . Is she home now ? " " She said she was going to get a bus to Ridgehampton . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Well , she still has some capital . " " That 's not the point . Your only entrance is money . " " Money gets money , " I said softly . " That 's right . Lose sight of that and you 're a gone goose , a clerk for the rest of your life . "  | " I 'm sorry it happened . " " Well , you better lay down the law . " " Women are funny , sir . Maybe your talking about makingmoney yesterday gave her the idea it was easy to get . " " Well , you disabuse her , because without it you ca n't get any . " Would you like a cold Coke , sir ? " " Yes , I would . " He could n't drink it out of the bottle . I had to open a package of paper picnic cups , but it cooled him a little . He muttered like retreating thunder . Two Negro ladies from the crossing came in and he had to swallow his Coke and his rage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savagely and he strode out and crossed the street to go home . I wondered if he was mad because he was suspicious , but I did n't think so . No , I think he was mad because he felt he 'd lost his habit of command . You can get furious at someone who does n't take your advice . The Negro ladies were pleasant . There 's a community of colored at the crossing , very nice people . They do n't trade with us much because they have their own store , only now and then they do some comparative shopping to see if their racial loyalty is n't costing them too much . They did more pricing than buying and I understand why  --  pretty women , too , such long , straight , slender legs . It 's a wonder what a lack of malnutrition in childhood can do for the human body , or the human spirit , for that matter . Just before closing time I telephoned Mary . " Pigeonflake , I 'm going to be a little late . " " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Foremaster . " " I remember . " " How late are you going to be ? " " Ten or fifteen minutes . I want to walk down and look at the dredger in the harbor . " " Why ? "  | " I 'm thinking of buying it . " " Oh ! " " Want me to pick up some fish ? " " Well , if you see some nice flounder . That 's about all that 's running . " " All right  --  I 'm running . " " Now do n't dawdle . You 'll have to bathe and change . The Foremaster , you know . " " I wo n't , my fair , my lovely . Mr. Baker gave me hell for letting you spend a thousand dollars . " " Why , that old goat ! " " Mary  --  Mary ! The walls have ears . " " You tell him what he can do . " " But he ca n't . Besides , he thinks you 're a nitwit . " " What ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know how I am . " She was laughing her lovely trill , something that raises goose lumps of pleasure on my soul . " Hurry home , darling , " she said . " Hurry home . " And how 's that for a man to have ! When I hung up , I stood by the phone all weak and leaky and happy if there is such a condition . I tried to think how it had been before Mary , and I could n't remember , or how it would be without her , and I could not imagine it except that it would be a conditionbordered in black . I guess everyone at some time or other writes his epitaph . Mine would be " Good-by Charley . " The sun was below the western hills but a great powdery cloud scooped its light and threw it on the harbor and the breakwater and the sea beyond so that the whitecaps were pink as roses . The piles in the water by the city pier are triple logs iron-banded at the top and sloping like pylons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one a gull stood motionless , usually a male with white immaculate vest and clean gray wings . I wonder if each one owns his place and can sell or rent it at will.  |p165A  few fishing boats were in . I know all the fishermen , have known them all my life . And Mary was right . They only had flounder . I bought four nice ones from Joe Logan and stood by while he filleted them for mc , his knife slipping along the spine as easily as it would through water . In the spring there is one sure subject  --  when will the weakfish come ? We used to say , " When lilacs bloom the weakfish coome , " but you ca n't depend on it . Seems to me that all my life the weaks have not arrived or have just left . And what beautiful fish they are when you get one , slender as trout , clean , silver as  --  silver . They smell good . Well , they were n't running . Joe Logan had n't taken a single one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Funny thing , when you call them blowfish nobody will touch them , but call them sea chicken and customers fight for them . " " How 's your daughter , Joe ? " " Oh , she seems to get better and then she fades off . It 's killing me . " " Too bad . I 'm sorry . " " If there was anything to do  --  " " I know  --  poor kid . Here 's a bag . Just drop the flounders in it . Give her my love , Joe . " He looked me long in the eyes as though he hoped to draw something out of me , some medicine . " I 'll do that , Eth , " he said . " I 'll tell her . " Back of the breakwater the county dredger was working , its giant screw angering up mud and shells and the pumps pushing the junk through pipe on pontoons and flinging it behind the black-tarred bulkheads on the shore . Its running lights were on and its riding lights too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was working . A pale cook in white cap and apron leaned his bare arms on the rail and looked down into the troubled water and occasionally he spat into the roil . The wind was inshore . It brought from the dredger the stink of mud and long-dead shells and tarnishedp166weed together with the sweet smell of baking cinnamon in apple pie . The great auger turned with majesty , boring out the channel . Then with a flash of pink the sails of a lithe yacht caught the afterglow and came about and lost the light . I wanderedback and turned left past the new mariana and the old yacht club and the American Legion Hall with brownpaintedmachine guns mounted beside its steps . At the boat yard they were working late trying to get the stored craft painted and ready against the coming summer . The unusual cold of the early spring had set them back with the painting and varnishing . I walked well past the boat works and then down through the weed-grown lot to the harbor 's edge and then slowly back toward Danny 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wishing me to . And it seemed he did . His shack was empty but I knew as surely as if I saw him that Danny was lying hidden in the weeds , perhaps between the huge square timbers that were scattered about . And since I knew he would come back as soon as I was gone , I took the brown envelope from my pocket and propped it on his dirty bed and I went away , still whistling , except for one moment when I called softly , " Good-by , Danny . Good luck . " And I went on whistling back to the street and over to Porlock and past the great houses to Elm and so to my own  --  the Hawley house . I found my Mary in the eye of a storm , quiet and slowly rotating herself with debris and great winds surging around her . She directed the devastation in her white nylon slip and slippers ; her new-washed hair clustered on curlers on her head like a large litter of suckling sausages . I ca n't rememberwhen we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't afford it and had lost the habit . Mary 's wild excitementfluttered the children on the edges of her personal hurricane . She fed them , washed them , issued orders , rescindedorders . The ironing board was standing in thep167kitchen with my dear and valued clothing pressed and hanging on the backs of chairs . Mary would pause in her gallop to swipe the iron at a dress she was pressing . The children were almost too excited to eat , but they had their orders . I have five suits called best  --  a good number for a grocery clerk to have . I fingered them on the chair backs . They were called Old Blue , Sweet George Brown , Dorian Grey , BuryingBlack , and Dobbin . " Which one shall I wear , cuddles ? " " Cuddles ? Oh ! Well , it 's not formal and it 's Monday night . I 'd say it would be Sweet George or Dorian , yes , Dorian , that 's formal enough without being formal . " " And my polka-dot bow tie ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! You 're not going to wear a bow tie ! You 're too old . " " I am not . I 'm young and gay and giddy . " " You 'll be a laughing stork . I 'm glad I 'm not going . " " I am too . Where do you get the idea that I 'm an old stork ? " " Well you are n't old , but you 're too old for a bow tie . " " You 're a nasty little conformist . " " Well , if you want to be a laughing stork . " " That 's what I want to be . Mary , do n't you want me to be a laughing stork ? " " Let your father alone , he has to bathe . I laid a shirt out on the bed . " Allen said , " I 'm halfway through my I Love America essay . " " That 's good , because come summer I 'm going to put you to work . " " Work ? " " In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem too enthusiastic . Ellen gave an opening gasp but when she had our attentionshe did n't say anything . Mary repeated the eighty/five things the children were to do and not to do while we were gone and I went upstairs for my tub . I was tying my dear blue polka-dot , my only blue polkadottie when Ellen leaned in against the door . " It would n't be so bad if you were younger , " she said with dreadful femininity . " You 're going to give some happy husband a rough time , my dear . " " Even the seniors in high school would n't wear it . " " Prime Minister Macmillan does . " " That 's different . Daddy , is it cheating to copy something out of a book ? " " Explain ! " " Well , if a person , if I was writing my essay and I took stuff out of a book  --  how about that ? " " It would depend on how you did it . " " Like you said  --  explain . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes . " " Well , if you put quotation marks around it and a footnotetelling who wrote it , it could add dignity and authority . I guess half the writing in America is quotations if it is n't anthologies . Now do you like my tie ? " " S'pose you did n't put those marks . . . " " Then it would be stealing like any other kind of stealing . You did n't do that , did you ? " " No . " " Then what is your problem ? " " Could they put you in jail ? " " Might  --  if you got money for it . Do n't do it , my girl . Now what do you think about my tie ? " " I guess you 're just impossible , " she said . " If you plan to join the others , you might tell your blinkingbrother that I brought him his bleeding Mickey Mouse mask and shame on him . " " You never listen , really listen . "  | " I do too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sorry . " " Good-by , Leda . Say hello to the swan . " She lounged away , a baby-fatted volupt . Girls kill me . They turn out to be girls . My Mary was just beautiful , just beautiful and shining . A light from inside her oozed out of her pores . She took my arm as we walked down Elm Street under the arching trees with the street lights playing on us and I swear our legs moved with the proud and tender steps of thoroughbredscoming to the barrier . " You must come to Rome ! Egypt is n't big enough for you . The great world calls . " She giggled . I swear she giggled as would have done honor to our daughter . " We 're going to go out more often , my darling . " " When ? " " When we are rich . " " When is that ? " " Soon . I 'm going to teach you to wear shoes . " " Will you light your cigars with ten-dollar bills ? " " Twenties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ma'am . You oughten to say that . You plumb embarrass me . " Not long ago the owners of the Foremaster installed bow windows on the street , with small square panes of bottle glass , designed to make the place look old and authentic  --  and it did so look  --  but people sitting inside at the tables had their faces altered by the warping glass . One face would be all jaw , another one big vacant eye , but it all added to the age and the authenticity of the old Foremaster and so did the geraniums and lobelias in the window boxes . Margie was waiting for us , hostess to her fingertips . She introduced her companion , a Mr. Hartog of New York ,  |p170sun-lam|p  tanned and set with teeth like an ear of Country Gentleman . Mr. Hartog looked wrapped and shellacked , but he answered all sentences with an appreciative laugh . That was his contribution and it was n't a bad one . " How d' you do ? " said Mary . Mr. Hartog laughed . I said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Mr. Hartog laughed . We all felt good . Margie said , " I 've asked for a table by the window . That one there . " " You also had them put special flowers , Margie . " " Mary , I have to do something to repay all your kind-ness . " They went on like this during and after Margie had seated us , and Mr. Hartog laughed at every period , clearly a brilliant man . I made a plan to get a word from him , but later . The set table seemed fine and very white and the silver which was n't silver looked extra silvery . Margie said , " I 'm the hostess and that means I 'm the boss and I say martinis whether you want them or not . " Mr. Hartog laughed . The martinis came , not in little glasses but big as bird baths with twists of lemon peel . The first taste bit like a vampire bat , made its little anesthesia , and after that the drink mellowed and toward the bottom turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Margie . " The food 's pretty good here but not that good . " Then I told how I had always planned to open a bar where you could only get your second martini . I would make a fortune . Mr. IIartog laughed and four more bird baths appeared at our table while I was still chewing the first lemon peel . With the first taste of his second drink , Mr. Hartog developedthe power of speech . He had a low , vibrant voice ,  |p171like  that of an actor or a singer or a salesman of some productpeople do n't want . You might even call it a bedside voice . " Mrs. Young-Hunt tells me you 're in business here , " he said . " It 's a fascinating town  --  unspoiled . " I was about to tell him exactly what my business consistedin when Margie took the ball . " Mr. Hawley is the coming power of this county , " she said . " So ? What line are you in , Mr. Hawley ? " " Everything , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ openly , you understand . " Her eyes had a liquor shine . I looked at Mary 's eyes and they were just beginning to surface , so I judged the others had had a couple before we came , or at least Margie had . " Well , that saves me from denying it , " I said . Mr. Hartog came back to his laugh . " You have a lovely wife . That 's half the battle . " " That 's the whole battle . " " Ethan , you 'll make him think we fight . " " Oh , we do ! " I gulped half the glass and felt the warmth spring up behind my eyes . And I was looking at the bottle end of one of the tiny window panes . It caught the candlelightand seemed to revolve slowly . Maybe it was self-hypnosis , for I heard my own voice go on , listened to myself from outside myself . " Mrs. Margie is the Witch of the East . A martini is not a drink . It 's a potion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , dear ! I always thought of myself as Ozma . Was n't the Witch of the East a wicked witch ? " " She was indeed . " " And did n't she melt ? " Through the crooked glass I saw a man 's figure walking past on the sidewalk . He was all misshaped by the distortion , but he carried his head a little to the left and walked curiously on the outsides of his feet . Danny did that . I saw myself leap up and run after him . I saw myself run to thep172corner of Elm Street but he had disappeared , perhaps in the back garden of the second house . I called , " Danny ! Danny ! Give me back the money . Please , Danny , give it to me . Do n't take it . It 's poisoned . I poisoned it ! " I heard a laugh . It was Mr. Hartog 's laugh . Margie said , " Well , I would rather be Ozma . " I wiped the tears from my eyes with my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not bathe my eyes in it . It burns . " " Your eyes are all red , " Mary said . I could n't get back to the party but I heard myself talk and tell stories and I heard my Mary laugh like golden glory so I guess I was funny , and even charming , but I could n't ever get back to the table . And I think Margie knew it . She kept looking at me with a concealed question , damn her . She was a witch . I do n't know what we had to eat . I remember white wine so perhaps it was fish . The brittle glass revolved like a propeller . And there was brandy , so I must have had coffee  --  and then it was over . Going out , when Mary and Mr. Hartog had gone ahead , Margie asked , " Where did you go ? " " I do n't know what you mean . " " You went away . You were only part here . " " Aroint ye , witch ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our way home I searched the shadows of the gardens . Mary clung to my arm and her footsteps were a little jerky . " What a nice time , " she said . " I never had a better time . " " It was nice . " " Margie 's a perfect hostess . I do n't know how I 'll match that dinner . " " She surely is . " " And you , Ethan . I knew you could be funny but you had us laughing all the time . Mr. Hartog said he was weak from laughing about Mr. Red Baker . "  |p173Had  I told that ? Which one ? I must have . Oh , Danny  --  give back the money ! Please ! " You 're better than a show , " my Mary said . And in our own doorway I grabbed her so tight that she whimpered . " You 're tipped , darling . You 're hurting . Please do n't let 's wake the children . " It was my intention to wait until she slept and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look for him , even to put the police on him . But I knew better . Danny was gone . I knew Danny was gone . And I lay in the darkness and watched the little red and yellow spots swimming in the water of my eyes . I knew what I had done , and Danny knew it too . I thought of my small rabbit slaughter . Maybe it 's only the first time that 's miserable . It has to be faced . In business and in politics a man must carve and maul his way through men to get to be King of the Mountain . Once there , he can be great and kind  --  but he must get there first.  |p174THE  Templeton Airfield is only about forty miles from New Baytown , and that 's about five minutes ' flying time for the jets . They come over with increasing regularity , swarms of deadly gnats . I wish I could admire them , even love them the way my son Allen does . If they had more than one purpose , maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've had a bellyful of that . I have n't learned , as Allen has , to locate them by looking ahead of the sound they make . They go through the sound barrier with a boom that makes me think the furnace has exploded . When they go over at night they get into my dreams and I awaken with a sad sick feelingas though my soul had an ulcer . Early in the morning a flight of them boomed through and I jumped awake , a little trembly . They must have made me dream of those German 88-millimeter all-purpose rifles we used to admire and fear so much . My body was prickly with fear sweat as I lay in the gatheringmorning light and listened to the slender spindles of malice whining away in the distance . I thought how that shudder was under the skin of everybody in the world , not in the mind , deep under the skin . It 's not the jets so much as what their purpose is . When a condition or a problem becomes too great , humanshave the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inward and minces up with a lot of other things already there and what comes out is discontent and uneasiness , guilt and a compulsion to get something  --  anything  --  before it is all gone . Maybe the assembly-line psychoanalysts are n't dealing with complexes at all but with those warheads that may one day be mushroom clouds . It does seem to me that nearly everyone I see is nervous and restless and a little loud and gaily crazy like people getting drunk on New Year 's Eve . Should auld acquaintance be forgot and kiss your neighbor 's wife . I turned my head toward mine . She was not smiling in her sleep . Her mouth was drawn down and there were lines of weariness around her squinched-shut eyes and so she was sick , because that 's the way she looks when she is sick . She is the wellest wife in the world until she is sick , which is n't often , and then she is the sickest wife in the world . Another flight of jets exploded through sound . We had maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than fifteen to build thinking about this force so extravagantly more fierce than fire . Would we ever have the chance to make a tool of this ? If the laws of thinking are the laws of things , can fission be happening in the soul ? Is that what is happening to me , to us ? I remember a story Aunt Deborah told me long ago . Early in the last century some of my people were Cambellites . Aunt Deborah was a child then , but she remembered how the end of the world was coming at a certain time . Her parents gave everything away , everything they owned but the bed sheets . Those they put on and at the predicted time they went to the hills to meet the End of the World . Dressed in sheets , hundreds of people prayed and sang . The night came and they sang louder and danced and as it got near time there was a shooting star , she said , and everybody screamed . She could still remember the screaming . Like wolves , she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hyena . Then the moment came . White-dressed men andp176women and children held their breaths . The moment went on and on . The children got blue in the face  --  and then it passed . It was done and they were cheated out of their destruction . In the dawn they crept down the hill and tried to get back the clothes they had given away , and the pots and pans and their ox and their ass . And I remember knowing how bad they must have felt . I think what brought that back was the jets  --  all that enormouseffort and time and money to stockpile all that death . Would we feel cheated if we never used it ? We can shoot rockets into space but we ca n't cure anger or discontent . My Mary opened her eyes . " Ethan , " she said , " you 're talking in your mind . I do n't know what it 's about but it 's loud . Stop thinking , Ethan . " I was going to suggest that she give up drink but she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to joke , but this time I said , " Head ? " " Yes . " " Stomach ? " " Yes . " " All over ? " " All over . " " I 'll get you something . " " Get me a grave . " " Stay down . " " I ca n't . I 've got to get the children off to school . " " I 'll do it . " " You 've got to go to work . " " I 'll do it , I tell you . " After a moment she said , " Ethan , I do n't think I can get up . I feel too bad . " " Doctor ? " " No . " " I ca n't leave you alone . Can Ellen stay with you ? " " No , she has examinations . " " Could I call up Margie Young-Hunt to come over ? "  | " Her phone is out . She 's getting a new thingamabob . " " I can go by and ask her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this early . " " I could slip a note under her door . " " No , I do n't want you to . " " Nothing to it . " " No , no . I do n't want you to . I do n't want you to . " " I ca n't leave you alone . " " That 's funny . I feel better . I guess it was shouting at you that did it . ' Well , it 's true , " she said , and to prove it she got up and put on her dressing gown . She did look better . " You 're wonderful , my darling . " I cut myself shaving and went down to breakfast with a red tatter of toilet paper sticking to my face . No Morph standing on the porch picking his teeth when I went by . I was glad . I did n't want to see him . I hurried just in case he might try to catch up with me . When I opened the alley door I saw the brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sealed and bank envelopes are tough . I had to get out my pocket knife to slit it open . Three sheets of paper from a five-cent lined school pad , written on with a soft lead pencil . A will : " I , being in my right mind . . . " and " In consideration I . . . " A note of hand : " I agree to repay and pledge my . . . " Both papers signed , the writing neat and precise . " Dear Eth : This is what you want . " The skin on my face felt as hard as a crab 's back . I closed the alley door slowly as you 'd close a vault . The first two sheets of paper I folded carefully and placed in my wallet , and the other  --  I crumpled it and put it in the toilet and pulled the chain . It 's a high box toilet with a kind of step in the bowl . The balled paper resisted going over the edge , but finally it did . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cubicle . I thought I had closed it . Going toward it , I heardp178a small sound and , looking up , I saw that damn cat on one of the top storage shelves hooking out with its claws for a hanging side of bacon . It took a long-handled broom and quite a chase to drive it out into the alley . As it streaked past me , I swiped at it and missed and broke the broom handle against the doorjamb . There was no sermon for the canned goods that morning . I could n't raise a text . But I did get out a hose to wash down the front sidewalk and the gutter too . Afterward I cleaned the whole store , even corners long neglected and choked with Rug . And I sang too : " Now is the winter of our discontentMade glorious summer by this sun of York . " I know it 's not a song , but I sang it.  |p181NEw  Baytown is a lovely place . Its harbor , once a great one , is sheltered from the northeast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about a complex of inland watersfed by the tides , which at ebb and flow drive wild races through narrow channels from the harbor and the sea . It is not a crowded or an urban town . Except for the great houses of the long-gone whalers , the dwellings are small and neat , distributed among fine old trees , oaks of several kinds , maples and elms , hickory and some cypresses , but except for the old planted elms on the original streets , the native timber is largely oak . Once the virgin oaks were so many and so large that several shipyards drew planks and knees , keels and keelsons , from nearby . Communities , like people , have periods of health and times of sickness  --  even youth and age , hope and despondency . There was a time when a few towns like New Baytownfurnished the whale oil that lighted the Western World . Student lamps of Oxford and Cambridge drew fuel from this American outpost . And then petroleum , rock oil gushed out in Pennsylvania and cheap kerosene , called coal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of the sea hunters . Sickness or the despair fell on New Baytown  --  perhaps an attitude from which it did not recover . Other towns not too far away grew and prosperedp182on other products and energies , but New Baytown , whose whole living force had been in square-rigged ships and whales , sank into torpor . The snake of population crawling out from New York passed New Baytown by , leaving it to its memories . And , as usually happens , New Baytown peoplepersuaded themselves that they liked it that way . They were spared the noise and litter of summer people , the garishglow of neon signs , the spending of tourist money and tourist razzle-dazzle . Only a few new houses were built around the fine inland waters . But the snake of population continued to writhe out and everyone knew that sooner or later it would engulf the village of New Baytown . The local people longed for that and hated the idea of it at the same time . The neighboring towns were rich , spilled over with loot from tourists , puffed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new rich . Old Baytown spawned art and ceramics and pansies , and the damn broadfooted brood of Lesbos wove handmade fabrics and small domestic intrigues . New Baytown talked of the old days and of flounder and when the weakfish would start running . In the reedy edges of the inner waters , the mallards nested and brought out their young flotillas , muskrats dug communities and swam lithely in the early morning . The ospreys hung , aimed , and plummeted on fish , and sea gulls carried clams and scallops high in the air and dropped them to break them open for eating . Some otters still clove the water like secret furry whispers ; rabbits poached in the gardensand gray squirrels moved like little waves in the streets of the village . Cock pheasants flapped and coughed their crowing . Blue herons poised in the shallow water like leggy rapiers and at night the bitterns cried out like lonesome ghosts . Spring is late and summer late at New Baytown , but when it comes it has a soft , wild , and special sound and smell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and blade and flowers explodes , and every sunset is different . Then inp 183the evening the bobwhites state their crisp names and after dark there is a wall of sound of whippoorwill . The oaks grow fat with leaf and fling their long-tasseled blossoms in the grass . Then dogs from various houses meet and go on picnics , wandering bemused and happy in the woods , and sometimes they do not come home for days . In June man , hustled by instinct , mows grass , riffles the earth with seeds , and locks in combat with mole and rabbit , ant , beetle , bird , and all others who gather to take his garden from him . Woman looks at the curling-edge petals of a rose and melts a little and sighs , and her skin becomes a petal and her eyes are stamens . June is gay  --  cool and warm , wet and shouting with growth and reproduction of the sweet and the noxious , the builder and the spoiler . The girls in body-form slacks wanderthe High Street with locked hands while small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their ears . The young boys , bleeding with sap , sit on the stools of Tanger 's Drugstore ingesting future pimples through straws . They watch the girls with level goat-eyes and make disparagingremarks to one another while their insides whimper with longing . In June businessmen drop by Al ' n ' Sue 's or the Foremasterfor a beer and stay for whisky and get sweatily drunk in the afternoon . Even in the afternoon the dusty cars creep to the desolate dooryard of the remote and paintless house with every blind drawn , at the end of Mill Street , where Alice , the village whore , receives the afternoon problems of June-bitten men . And all day long the rowboats anchor off the breakwater and happy men and women coax up their dinners from the sea . June is painting and clipping , plans and projects . It 's a rare man who does n't bring home cement blocks and twoby-foursand on the backs of envelopes rough out drawings of Taj Mahals . A hundred little boats lie belly down and keel up on the shore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straighten up and smile at the slow , unmoving windrows . Still school grips the intransigent childrenuntil near to the end of the month and , when examinationtime comes , rebellion foams up and the common cold becomes epidemic , a plague which disappears on closingday . In June the happy seed of summer germinates . " Where shall we go over the glorious Fourth of July ? . . . It 's getting on time we should be planning our vacation . " June is the mother of potentials , ducklings swim bravely perhaps to the submarine jaws of snapping turtles , lettuces lunge towarddrought , tomatoes rear defiant stems toward cutworms , and families match the merits of sand and sunburn over fretful mountain nights loud with mosquito symphonies . " This year I 'm going to rest . I wo n't get so tired . This year I wo n't allow the kids to make my free two weeks a hell on wheels . I work all year . This is my time . I work all year . " Vacation planning triumphs over memory and all 's right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long time . The men who governed it , politically , morally , economically , had so long continued that their ways were set . The Town Manager , the council , the judges , the police were eternal . The Town Manager sold equipment to the township , and the judges fixed traffic tickets as they had for so long that they did not remember it as illegal practice  --  at least the books said it was . Being normal men , they surely did not consider it immoral . All men are moral . Only their neighbors are not . The yellow afternoon had the warm breath of summer . A few early season people , those without children to hold them glued until school was out , were moving in the streets , strangers . Some cars came through , towing small boats and big outboard motors on trailers . Ethan would have known with his eyes closed that they were summer people by what they bought  --  cold cuts and process cheese , crackers and tinned sardines.  |p185Joey  Morphy came in for his afternoon refreshment as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He waved the bottle toward the cold counter .

The sun , held back by daylight-saving , was still high and the streets light as midafternoon when he brought in the fruit bins and closed the front doors and drew the green shades . Then , reading from a list , he gathered the supplies to carry home and put them all in one big bag . With his apron off and his coat and hat on , he boosted up and sat on the counter and stared at the shelves of the congregation . " No message ! " he said . " Only remember the words of Satchel Paige . I guess I have to learn about not looking back . " He took the folded lined pages from his wallet , made a little envelope for them of waxed paper .

" He said aloud , " OL 6-5888  --  OL 6-5888 because it 's late . " And then he spoke to his canned goods without looking at them . " If everything 's proper and aboveboard , nobody gets hurt . " Ethan went out the alley door and locked it . He carried his bag of groceries across the street to the Foremaster Hotel and Grill . The grill was noisy with cocktailers but the tiny lobby where the public phone booth stood was deserted even by the room clerk .

The sound stopped by the doorstep . Ethan called , " Mary , Mary , my darling . I love you . " And the whirling blades raged on through the overgrown grass.  |p194MARGIE  Young-Hunt was an attractive woman , informed , clever ; so clever that she knew when and how to mask her cleverness . Her marriages had failed , the men had failed ; one by being weak , and the second weaker  --  he died . Dates did not come to her . She created them , mended her fences by frequent telephone calls , by letters , get-well cards , and arranged accidental meetings . She carried homemade soup to the sick and remembered birthdays . By these means she kept people aware of her existence . More than any woman in town she kept her stomach flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and her chinlinetaut . A goodly part of her income went to hair , nails , massage , creams , and unguents . Other women said , " She must be older than she looks . " When supporting muscles of her breasts no longer responded to creams , massage , and exercise , she placed them in shapely forms that rode high and jauntily . Her make-up took increasing time . Her hair had all the sheen , luster , wave the television products promise . On a date , dining , dancing , laughing , amusing , drawing her escort with a net of small magnets , who could know her cold sense of repetition ? After a decent interval and an outlay of money , she usually went to bed with him if she discreetly could . Then back to her fence-mending . Sooner or later the shared bed must bep195the trap to catch her future security and ease . But the prospective game leaped clear of the quilted jaws . More and more of her dates were the married , the infirm , or the cautious . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running out . The tarot cards did not respond when she sought help for herself . Margie had known many men , most of them guilty , wounded in their vanity , or despairing , so that she had developed a contempt for her quarry as a professional hunter of vermin does . It was easy to move such men through their fears and their vanities . They ached so to be fooled that she no longer felt triumph  --  only a kind of disgusted pity . These were her friends and associates . She protected them even from the discovery that they were her friends . She gave them the best of herself because they demanded nothing of her . She kept them secret because at the bottom she did not admire herself . Danny Taylor was one of these , and Alfio Marullo another , and Chief Stonewall Jackson Smith a third , and there were others . They trusted her and she them , and their secret existence was the one warm honesty to which she could retire to restore herself . These friends talked freely and without fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Andersen 's Well  --  receptive , unjudging , and silent . As most people have secret vices , Margie Young-Hunt concealeda secret virtue . And because of this quiet thing it is probable that she knew more about New Baytown , and even Wessex County , than anyone , and her knowledge was unwarped because she would not  --  could not  --  use it for her own profit . But in other fields , everything that came to her hand was usable . Her project Ethan Allen Hawley began casually and out of idleness . In a way he was correct in thinking it was mischievous , a testing of her power . Many of the sad men who came to her for comfort and reassurance were hogtied with impotence , bound and helpless in sexual traumas that infectedall other areas of their lives . And she found it easy byp196small flatteries and reassurances to set them free to fight again against their whip-armed wives . She was genuinely fond of Mary Hawley , and through her she gradually became aware of Ethan , bound in another kind of trauma , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainty . Having no work , no love , no children , she wondered whether she could release and direct this crippled man toward some new end . It was a game , a kind of puzzle , a test , a product not of kindness but simply of curiosity and idleness . This was a superior man . To direct him would prove her superiority , and this she needed increasingly . Probably she was the only one who knew the depth of the change in Ethan and it frightened her because she thought it was her doing . The mouse was growing a lion 's mane . She saw the muscles under his clothes , felt ruthlessness growing behind his eyes . So must the gentle Einstein have felt when his dreamed concept of the nature of matter flashed over Hiroshima . Margie liked Mary Hawley very much and she had little sympathy and no pity for her . Misfortune is a fact of nature acceptable to women , especially when it falls on other women . In her tiny immaculate house set in a large , overgrown garden very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mirror to inspect her tools , and her eyes saw through cream , powder , eye-shadowing , and lashes sheathed in black , saw the hidden wrinkles , the inelasticity of skin . She felt the years creep up like the rising tide about a rock in a calm sea . There is an arsenal of maturity , of middle age , but these require training and technique she did not yet have . She must learn them before her structure of youth and excitement crumbled and left her naked , rotten , ridiculous . Her success had been that she never let down , even alone . Now , as an experiment , she allowed her mouth to droop as it wanted to , her eyelids to fall half-staff . Shep 197lowered her high-held chin and a plaited rope came into being . Before her in the mirror she saw twenty years clamber over her and she shuddered as the icy whispering told her what lay waiting . She had delayed too long . A woman must have a showcase in which to grow old , lights , props , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pilfering , love , protection , and small change , a serene and undemanding husband or his even more serene and less demanding will and trust fund . A woman growing old alone is useless cast-off trash , a wrinkled obscenity with no hobbledretainers to cluck and mutter over her aches and to rub her pains . A hot spot of fear formed in her stomach . She had been lucky in her first husband . He was weak and she soon found the valve of his weakness . He was hopelessly in love with her , so much so that when she needed a divorce he did not ask for a remarriage clause in his alimony settlement . Her second husband thought she had a private fortune and so she had . He did n't leave her much when he died , but , with the alimony from her first husband , she could live decently , dress well , and cast about at leisure . Suppose her first husband should die ! There was the fear spot . There was the night- or daymare  --  the monthly-check-mare . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross of Madison Avenue and Fifty-seventh Street . He looked old and gaunt . She was haunted with his mortality . If the bastard died , the money would stop . She thought she might be the only person in the world who wholeheartedly prayed for his health . His lean , silent face and dead eyes came on her memory screen now and touched off the hot spot in her stomach . If the son of a bitch should die . . . ! Margie , leaning toward the mirror , paused and hurled her will like a javelin . Her chin rose ; the ropes dropped back ; her eyes shone ; the skin snuggled close to her skull ; herp198shoulders squared . She stood up and waltzed in a deft circle on the deep-piled red carpet . Her feet were bare , with gleaming pinkened toenails . She must rush , she must hurry , before it was too late . She flung open her closet and laid hands on the sweet , provocative dress she had been saving for the Fourth of July weekend , the shoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stockings at all . There was no languor in her now . She dressed as quickly and efficiently as a butcher whets his knife and she checked against a full-length mirror the way that same butcher tests his blade against his thumb . Speed but no rush , speed for the man who will not wait , and then  --  the casual slowness of the informed , the smart , the chic , the confident , the lady with pretty legs and immaculate white gloves . No man she passed failed to look after her . Miller Brothers ' truckdriver whistled as he lumbered by with lumber and two high-school boys leveled slitted Valentino eyes at her and painfully swallowedthe saliva that flooded their half-open mouths . " How about that ? " said one . And , " Yeah ! " the other replied . " How 'd you like  --  " " Yeah ! " A lady does not wander  --  not in New Baytown . She must be going someplace , have some business , however small and meaningless . As she walked in dotted steps along the High @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them automatically . Mr. Hall  --  he was living on credit , had been for some time . Stoney  --  a tough , male man , but what woman could live on a cop 's salary or pension ? Besides , he was her friend . I iarold Beck with real estate and plenty of it , but Harold was queer as a duck . He himself was probably the only person in the world who did n't know it.  |p199MacDowell   --  " So nice to see you , sir . How 's Milly ? " Impossible  --  Scottish , tight , tied to his wife  --  an invalid , the kind who lives forever . He was a secret . No one knew what he was worth . Dew-eyed Donald Randolph  --  wonderful on the next bar stool , a barroom gentleman whose manners penetrated deep into his drunkenness , but useless unless you wanted to keep house on a bar stool . Harold Luce  --  it was said that he was related to the publisherof Time magazine but who said it , himself ? A flinty man who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power of speech . Ed Wantoner  --  a liar , a cheat , and a thief . Supposed to be loaded and his wife was dying , but Ed trusted no one . He did n't even trust his dog not to run away . Kept it tied up and howling . Paul Strait  --  a power in the Republican party . His wife was named Butterfly  --  not a nickname . Butterfly Strait , christened Butterfly , and that 's the truth . Paul did well if New York State had a Republican governor . He owned the city dump , where it cost a quarter to dump a load of garbage . It was told that when the rats got so bad and big as to be dangerous , Paul sold tickets for the privilege of shooting them , rented flashlights and rifles  --  stocked .22-caliber cartridgesto shoot them with . He looked so like a president that many people called him Ike . But Danny Taylor while quietly drunk had referred to him as the Noblest Paul of them Aul , and that stuck . Noble Paul became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's sicker than he was . He 's gray sick . MarulIo 's eyes were those of a man shot in the stomach with a .45 . He had walked past the doorway of his own store without going in . Margie entered the store , bouncing her neat buttocks . Ethan was talking to a stranger , a youngish dark-hairedp200man , Ivy League pants and hat with a narrow brim . Fortyish , hard , tough , and devoted to whatever he was doing . He leaned over the counter and seemed about to inspect Ethan 's tonsils . Margie said , " Hi ! You 're busy . I 'll come back later . " There are endless idle but legitimate things a strolling woman can do in a bank . Margie crossed the alley mouth and went into the marble and brushed-steel temple . Joey Morphy lighted up the whole barred square of his teller 's window when he saw her . What a smile , what a character , what a good playmate , and what a lousy prospect as a husband . Margie properly appraised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain one . No double grave for Joey . She said , " Please , sir , do you have any fresh unsalted money ? " " Excuse me , ma'am , I 'll see . I 'm almost positive I saw some somewhere . How much of it would you like to have ? " " About six ounces , m'sieur . " She took a folding book from her white kid bag and wrote a check for twenty dollars . Joey laughed . He liked Margie . Once in a while , not too often , he took her out to dinner and laid her . But he also liked her company and her sense of play . Joey said , " Mrs. Young-Hunt , that reminds me of a friend I had who was in Mexico with Pancho Villa . Rememberhim ? " " Never knew him . " 3 ' " No jazz . It 's a story the guy told me . He said when PaN .. cho was in the north , he worked the mint printing twenty-peso notes . Made so many his men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counting anyway . Got to weighing them on a balance scale . " Margie said , " Joey , you ca n't resist autobiography . " " Hell , no , Mrs. Young-Hunt . I 'd have been about five years old . It 's a story . Seems a fine stacked dame , Injun but stacked , came in and said , My general , you have executedp201my husband and left me a poor widow with five children , and is that any way to run a popular revolution ? ' " Pancho went over her assets the way I 'm doing now . " " You got no mortgage , Joey . " " I know . It 's a story . Pancho said to an aide-de-camp , Weigh out five kilos of money for her . ' " Well , that 's quite a bundle . They tied it together with a piece of wire and the woman went out , dangling the bale of kale . Then a lieutenant stepped out and saluted and he said , My general ( they say it mi gral  --  like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was drunk . We put him in the jail around the corner . ' " Pancho had never taken his eyes off the dame walking away with the bundle . He said , Go out and shoot him . We can not disappoint that poor widow . ' " " Joey , you 're impossible . " " It 's a true story . I believe it . " He turned her check around . " Do you want this in twenties , fifties , or hundreds ? " " Give it to me in two-bitses . " They enjoyed each other . Mr. Baker looked out of his frosted-glass office . Now there was a bet . Baker had made a grammatically correct but obscure pass at her once . Mr. Baker was Mr. Money . Sure he had a wife , but Margie knew the Bakers of this world . They could always raise a moral reason for doing what they wanted to do anyway . She was glad she had turned him down . It left him still in the book . She gathered the four five-dollar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banker , but at that moment the man she had seen talking to Ethan came in quietly , passed in front of her , presented a card , and was taken into Mr. Baker 's office and the door closed . " Well , kiss my foot , " she said to Joey . " Prettiest foot in Wessex County , " Joey said . " Want to go out tonight ? Dance , eat , all that ? " " Ca n't , " she said . " Who is that ? "  | " Never saw him before . Looks like a bank-examiner type . It 's times like this I 'm glad I 'm honest and even gladder I can add and subtract . " " You know , Joey , you 're going to make some faithful woman a hell of a fine fugitive . " " That is my prayerful hope , ma'am . " " See you . " She went out , crossed the alley , and entered Marullo 's grocery again . " Hi , Eth . " " Hello , Margie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't you carry your crystal ball ? " " Secret agent ? " " Worse that that . Margie , is everybody afraid of cops ? Even if I have n't done anything I 'm scared of cops . " " Was that curly-haired piece of the true cross a dick ? " " Not exactly . Said he was a federal man . " " What you been up to , Ethan ? " " Up to ? Me ? Why up to ' ? " " What did he want ? " " I only know what he asked but I do n't know what he wanted . " " What did he ask ? " " How long do I know my boss ? Who else knows him ? When did he come to New Baytown ? " " What did you tell him ? " " When I joined up to fight the foe , I did n't know him . When I came back he was here . When I went broke , he took over the store and gave me a job . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " God knows . " Margie had been trying to look past his eyes . She thought , He 's pretending to be a simpleton . I wonder what the guy really wanted ! He said it so quietly it frightened her . " You do n't believep203me . You know , Margie , no one ever believes the truth . " " The whole truth ? When you carve a chicken , Eth , it 's all chicken , but some is dark meat and some white . " " I guess so . Frankly , I 'm worried , Margie . I need this job . If anything happened to Alfio I 'd be pounding the street . " " Are n't you forgetting you 're going to be rich ? " " Kind of hard to remember when I 'm not . " " Ethan , I wonder if you remember back . It was in the spring right near Easter . I came in and you called me Daughter of Jerusalem . " " That was Good Friday . " " You do remember . Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's pretty wonderful and  --  scary . " " Yes . " " What got into you ? " " My Great-Aunt Deborah . She got me crucified once a year . It still goes on . " " You 're kidding . You were n't kidding then . " " No , I was n't . And I 'm not now . " She said playfully , " You know , the fortune I read you is coming true . " " I know it is . " " Do n't you think you owe me something ? " " Sure . " " When are you going to pay ? " " Would you care to step into the back room ? " " I do n't think you could do it . " " You do n't ? " " No , Ethan , and you do n't either . You 've never had a quick jump in the hay in your life . " " I could learn , maybe . " " You could n't fornicate if you wanted to . " " I could try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arouse you , and either one would require a slow and stately procedure . "  | " Maybe you 're right . How did you know ? " " I never know how I know . " He slid the door of the cold cabinet open , took out a Coke , which instantly grew a jacket of frost , opened it , and handed the bottle to her while he opened a second . " What is it you want of me ? " " I 've never known a man like that . Perhaps I want to see what it 's like to be loved or hated that much . " " You 're a witch ! Why do n't you whistle up a wind ? " " I ca n't whistle . I can raise a puny little storm in most men with my eyebrows . How do I go about lighting your fire ? " " Maybe you have . " He studied her closely and did not try to conceal his inspection . " Built like a brick outhouse , " he said , " soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you know ? You 've never felt me .

You 're a fine broth of a dame but you 're also smart . What do you want ? " " I told your fortune and it 's coming true . " " And you want to suck along ? " " Yes . " " Now I can believe you . " He raised his eyes . " Mary of my heart , " he said , " look on your husband , your lover , your dear friend . Guard me against evil from within me and from harm without . I pray for your help , my Mary , for a man has a strange and wind-troubled need and the ache of the ages is on him to spread his seeds everywhere . Ora pro me . " " You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But ca n't I be a humble fake ? "  | " I 'm afraid of you now . I was n't before . " " I ca n't think why . " She had that tarot look and he saw it . " Marullo . " " What about him ? " " I 'm asking . " " Be with you in a moment . Half a dozen eggs , square of butter , right . How are you for coffee ? " " Yes , a can of coffee . I like to have it on the shelf . How is that Whumpdum corned-beef hash ? " " I have n't tried it . They say it 's very good . Be with you in a moment , Mr. Baker . Did n't Mrs. Baker get some of that Whumpdum corned-beef hash ?

This is ten years old . " " I ca n't believe it , Mr. Baker . How is Mrs. Baker ? " " Well enough to complain . Why do n't you call on her , Mrs. Young-Hunt ? She gets lonely . There are n't many people in this generation who can carry on a literate conversation . It was Wickham who said it . It 's the motto of Winchester College . " She turned to Ethan . " You show me another American banker who knows that . " Mr. Baker grew ruddy . " My wife subscribed to Great Books . She 's a great reader . Please call on her . "  | " I 'd love to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll pick them up on my way home . " " Right , ma'am . " " That 's quite a remarkable young woman , " Mr. Baker said . " She and Mary hit it off . " " Ethan , did that government man come here ? " " Yes . " " What does he want ? " " I do n't know . He asked some questions about Mr. Marullo . I did n't know the answers . " Mr. Baker released the image of Margie as slowly as an anemone opens and casts out the shell of a sucked-clean crab . " Ethan , have you seen Danny Taylor ? " " No , I have n't . " " Do you know where he is ? " " No , I do n't . " " I have to get in touch with him . Ca n't you think where he might be ? " " I have n't seen him for  --  well , since May . He was going to try the cure again . " " Do you know where ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to try . " " Was it a public institution ? " " I do n't think so , sir . He borrowed some money from me . " " What !

" " No sir . I just had a feeling he had more . " " If you know where he is , please tell me. " p 207 " I would if I knew , Mr. Baker . Maybe you could make a list of the places and phone .

" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know . " " Now you 're being smart . " " I learned from you , sir . " " Well , do n't forget it . " " Maybe I 'm learning little by little .

We have n't been out of town in years . " " That will come , Ethan . I think I 'll go to Maine overthe Fourth of July . I ca n't take the noise any more . " " I guess you bankers are the lucky ones . Were n't you inAlbany lately ? " " What gave you that idea ? " " I do n't know  --  heard it someplace . Maybe Mrs. Baker told Mary . " " She could n't . She did n't know it .

" " You have n't any choice now that you know about Albany . The state is looking into county and town affairs . " " Why ? " " I guess because the smell has got as far as Albany . " " No politics ?

" " I do n't know . That 's up to the state . " " Do you suppose Marullo is mixed in it ? I ca n't afford to lose my job . " " I do n't think so . That was a federal man . Department of Justice . Did n't you ask for his credentials ? " " Did n't think of it . He flashed them but I did n't look . " " Well , you should . You always should . " " I would n't think you 'd want to go away . " " Oh , that does n't matter . Nothing happens over Fourth of July weekend . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They knew everyone would be away . " " I wish I could take Mary someplace . " " Maybe you can later . I want you to whip your brains and try to find where Taylor is . " " Why ? Is it so important ? " " It is . I ca n't tell you why right now . " " I sure wish I could find him , then . "  | " Well , if you could turn him up maybe you would n't need this job . " " If it 's that way , I 'll sure try , sir . " " That 's the boy , Ethan . I 'm sure you will . And if you do locate him , you call me  --  any time , day or night . "  |p210I  WONDER about people who say they have n't time to think . For myself , I can double think . I find that weighing vegetables , passing the time of day with customers , fighting or loving Mary , coping with the children  --  none of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , conjecturing . Surely this must be true of everyone . Maybe not having time to think is not having the wish to think . In the strange , uncharted country I had entered , perhaps I had no choice . Questions boiled up , demanding to be noticed . And it was a world so new to me that I puzzled over matters old residents probably solved and put away when they were children . I had thought I could put a process in motion and controlit at every turn  --  even stop it when I wanted to . And now the frightening conviction grew in me that such a process may become a thing in itself , a person almost , having its own ends and means and quite independent of its creator . And another troublesome thought came in . Did I really start it , or did I simply not resist it ? I may have been the mover , but was I not also the moved ? Once on the long street , there seemed to be no crossroads , no forked paths , no choice. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morals ? Are they simply words ? Was it honorable to assess my father 's weakness , which was a generous mind and the illfoundeddream that other men were equally generous ? No , it was simply good business to dig the pit for him . IIe fell into it himself . No one pushed him . Was it immoral to strip him when he was down ? Apparently not . Now a slow , deliberate encirclement was moving on New Baytown , and it was set in motion by honorable men . If it succeeded , they would be thought not crooked but clever . And if a factor they had overlooked moved in , would that be immoral or dishonorable ? I think that would depend on whether or not it was successful . To most of the world success is never bad . I remember how , when Hitler moved unchecked and triumphant , many honorable men sought and found virtues in him . And Mussolini made the trains run on time , and Vichy collaborated for the good of France , and whatever else Stalin was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above morality , above criticism . It seems , then , that it is not what you do , but how you do it and what you call it . Is there a check in men , deep in them , that stops or punishes ? There does n't seem to be . The only punishment is for failure . In effect no crime is committed unless a criminal is caught . In the move designed for New Baytown some men had to get hurt , some even destroyed , but this in no way deterred the movement . I could not call this a struggle with my conscience . Once I perceived the pattern and accepted it , the path was clearly marked and the dangers apparent . What amazed me most was that it seemed to plan itself ; one thing grew out of another and everything fitted together . I watched it grow and only guided it with the lightest touch . What I had done and planned to do was undertaken with full knowledge that it was foreign to me , but necessary as a stirrup is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the stirrup would not be needed . Maybe I could not stop this process , but I need never start another . I did not need or want to be a citizen of this gray and dangerous country . I had nothing to do with the coming tragedy of July 7 . It was not my process , but I could anticipate and I could use it . One of our oldest and most often disproved myths is that a man 's thoughts show in his face , that the eyes are the windows of the soul . It is n't so . Only sickness shows , or defeat or despair , which are different kinds of sickness . Some rare people can feel beneath , can sense a change or hear a secret signal . I think my Mary felt a change , but she misinterpreted it , and I think Margie Young-Hunt knew  --  but she was a witch and that is a worrisome thing . It seemed to me that she was intelligent as well as magic  --  and that 's even more worrisome . I felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probablyon Friday afternoon of the Fourth of July weekend . The storm would have to break Friday or Saturday to give it time to take effect before election and it was logical to suppose that Mr. Baker would want to be away when the shock came . Of course that did n't matter much to me . It was more an exercise in anticipation , but it did make several moves necessary on Thursday , just in case he left that night . My Saturday matter was so finely practical that I could move through it in my sleep . If I had any fear of that , it was more like a small stage fright . On Monday , June 27 , Marullo came in soon after I had opened up . He walked about , looking strangely at the shelves , the cash register , the cold counter , and he walked back to the storeroom and looked about . You would have thought from his expression that he was seeing it for the first time . I said , " Going to take a trip over the Fourth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " Well , everybody does who can afford it . " " Oh ! Where would I go ? " " Where 's anybody go ? Catskills , even out to Montauk and fish . School tuna running . " The very thought of fighting a thirty-pound plunging fish drove arthritic pains up his arms so that he flexed them and winced . I very nearly asked him when he planned to go to Italy , but that seemed too much . Instead , I moved over to him and took him gently by his right elbow . " Alfio , " I said , " I think you 're nuts . Why do n't you go into New York to the best specialist ? There must be something to stop that pain . " " I do n't believe it . " " What have you got to lose ? Go ahead . Try it . " " What do you care ? " " I do n't . But I 've worked here a long time for a stupid son of a bitch dago . If a yellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it myself . You come in here and move your arms and it 's half an hour before I can straighten up . " " You like me ? " " Hell , no . I 'm buttering you up for a raise . " He looked at me with hound 's eyes , rimmed with red , and dark brown iris and pupil all one piece . He seemed about to say something but changed his mind about it . " You 're a good kid , " he said . " Do n't depend on it . " " A good kid ! " he said explosively and as though shocked by his show of emotion he went out of the store and walked away . I was weighing out two pounds of string beans for Mrs. Davidson when Marullo came charging back . He stood in the doorway and shouted at me . " You take my Pontiac . " " What ? " " Go someplace Sunday and Monday . "  | " I ca n't afford it . " " You take the kids . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tank full of gas . " " Wait a minute . " " You go to hell . Take the kids . " He tossed something like a spitball at me and it fell among the string beans . Mrs. Davidson watched him plunge away again down the street . I picked the green wad from the string beans  --  three twentydollarbills folded in a tight square . " What 's the matter with him ? " " He 's an excitable Italian . " " He must be , throwing money ! " He did n't show up the rest of the week , so that was all right . He 'd never gone away before without telling me . It was like watching a parade go by , just standing and watchingit go by and knowing what the next float would be but watching for it just the same . I had n't expected the Pontiac . He never loaned his car to anybody . It was a strange time . Some outside force or design seemed to have taken control of events so that they were crowded close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know the opposite can be true . Sometimes the force or design deflects and destroys , no matter how careful and deep the planning . I guess that 's why we believe in luck and unluck . On Thursday , the thirtieth of June , I awakened as usual in the black pearl light of the dawn , and that was early now in the lap of midsummer . Chair and bureau were dark blobs and pictures only lighter suggestions . The white windowcurtains seemed to sigh in and out as though they breathed , because it 's a rare dawn that does not wave a small wind over the land . Corning out of sleep , I had the advantage of two worlds , the layered firmament of dream and the temporal fixtures of the mind awake . I stretched luxuriously  --  a good and tingling sensation . It 's as though the skin has shrunk in thep215night and one must push it out to daytime size by bulging the muscles , and there 's an itching pleasure in it . First I referred to my remembered dreams as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything of interest or import . Then I explored the coming day for events that had not happened . Next I followed a practice learned from the best officer I ever had . He was Charley Edwards , a major of middling age , perhaps a little too far along to be a combat officer but he was a good one . He had a large family , a pretty wife and four children in steps , and his heart could ache with love and longing for them if he allowed it to . He told me about it . In his deadly business he could not afford to have his attention warped and split by love , and so he had arrived at a method . In the morning , that is if he were not jerked from sleep by an alert , he opened his mind and heart to his family . He went over each one in turn , how they looked , what they were like ; he caressed them and reassured them of his love . It was as though he picked precious things one by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , kissed it , and put it back ; and last he gave them a small good-by and shut the door of the cabinet . The whole thing took half an hour if he could get it and then he did n't have to think of them again all day . He could devote his full capacity , untwisted by conflicting thought and feeling , to the job he had to do  --  the killing of men . He was the best officer I ever knew . I asked his permission to use his method and he gave it to me . When he was killed , all I could think was that his had been a good and effective life . He had taken his pleasure , savored his love , and paid his debts , and how many people even approached that ? I did n't always use Major Charley 's method , but on a clay like this Thursday , when I knew my attention should be as uninterrupted as possible , I awakened when the day opened its door a crack and I visited my family as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bowed to Aunt Deborah . She was named for Deborah the Judge of Israel and I have read that a judge was a military leader . Perhaps she responded to her name . My great-aunt could have led armies . She did marshal the cohorts of thought . My joy in learning for no visible profit came from her . Stern though she was , she was charged with curiosity and had little use for anyone who was not . I gave her my obeisance . I offered a spectral toast to old Cap'n and ducked my head to my father . I even made my duty to the untenanted hole in the past I knew as my mother . I never knew her . She died before I could , and left only a hole in the past where she should be . One thing troubled me . Aunt Deborah and old Cap'n and my father would not come clear . Their outlines were vague and wavery where they should have been sharp as photographs . Well , perhaps the mind fades in its memories as old tintypes do  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't hold them forever . Mary should have been next but I laid her aside for later . I raised Allen . I could not find his early face , the face of joy and excitement that made me sure of the perfectability of man . He appeared what he had become  --  sullen , conceited , resentful , remote and secret in the pain and perplexityof his pubescence , a dreadful , harrowing time when he must bite everyone near , even himself , like a dog in a trap . Even in my mind 's picture he could not come out of his miserable discontent , and I put him aside , only saying to him , I know . I remember how bad it is and I ca n't help . No one can . I can only tell you it will be over . But you ca n't believe that . Go in peace  --  go with my love even though during this time we ca n't stand each other . Ellen brought a surge of pleasure . She will be pretty , prettier even than her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final shape she will have the strange authority of Aunt Deborah . Her moods , her cruelties , her nervous/ness are the ingredients of a being quite beautiful and dear . I know , because I saw her standing in her sleep holding the pink talisman to her little breast and looking a woman fulfilled . And as the talisman was important and still is to me , so it is to Ellen . Maybe it is Ellen who will carry and pass on whatever is immortal in me . And in my greeting I put my arms around her and she , true to form , tickled my ear and giggled . My Ellen . My daughter . I turned my head to Mary , sleeping and smiling on my right . That is her place so that , when it is good and right and ready , she can shelter her head on my right arm , leaving my left hand free for caressing . A few days before , I snicked my forefinger with the curved banana knife at the store , and a callusy scab toughenedthe ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line from ear to shoulder with my second finger but gently enough not to startle and firmly enough not to tickle . She sighed as she always does , a deep , gathered breath and a low release of luxury . Some people resent awakening , but not Mary . She comes to a day with expectancy that it will be good . And , knowing this , I try to offer some small gift to justify her conviction . And I try to hold back gifts for occasions , such as the one I now produced from my mind 's purse . Her eyes opened , hazed with sleep . " Already ? " she asked , and she glanced at the window to see how near the day had come . Over the bureau the picture hangs  --  trees and a lake and a small cow standing in the water of the lake . I made out the cow 's tail from my bed , and knew the day had come . " I bring you tidings of great joy , my flying squirrel . " " Crazy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Maybe . " it " Are you awake enough to hear the tidings of great joy ? " " No. "  | " Then I will withhold them . " She turned on her left shoulder and made a deep crease in her soft flesh . " You joke so much . If it 's like you 're going to cement over the lawn  --  " " I am not . " " Or you 're starting a cricket farm  --  " " No . But you do remember old discarded plans . " " Is it a joke ? " " Well , it 's a thing so strange and magic that you are going to have to buttress your belief . " Her eyes were clear and wakeful now and I could see the little trembles around her lips preparing for laughter . " Tell m e . " Do you know a man of Eyetalian extraction named Marullo ? " " Crazy  --  you 're being silly . " " You will find it so . Said Marullo has gone from here for a time . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " When will he be back ? " " Stop confusing me . He did n't say that either . What he did say and , when I protested , what he ordered was that we should take his car and go on a happy trip over the holi-day . " " You 're joking me . " " Would I tell a lie that would make you sad ? " " But why ? " " That I ca n't tell you . What I can swear to from Boy Scout oath to papal oath is that the mink-lined Pontiac with a tank full of virgin gasoline awaits your highness 's pleasure . " " But where shall we go ? " " That , my lovely insect-wife is what you are going to decide , and take all day today , tomorrow , and Saturday to plan it . "  | " But Monday 's a holiday . That 's two full days . " " That 's correct . " " Can we afford it ? It might mean a motel or something . " " Can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purse . " " Silly , I know your purse . I ca n't imagine him lending his car . " " Neither can I , but he did . " " Do n't forget he brought candy Easter . " " Perhaps it is senility . " " I wonder what he wants . " " That 's not worthy of my wife . Perhaps he wants us to love him . " " I 'll have to do a thousand things . " " I know you will . " I could see her mind plowing into the possibilities like a bulldozer . I knew I had lost her attention and probably could n't get it back , and that was good . At breakfast before my second cup of coffee she had picked up and discarded half the pleasure areas of eastern America . Poor darling had n't had much fun these last few years . I said , " Chloe , I know I 'm going to have trouble gettingyour attention . A very important investment is offered . Iwant some more of your money . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know about it ? " " It 's his idea . " " Then take it . You sign a check . " " Do n't you want to know how much ? " " I guess so . " " Do n't you want to know what the investment is ? The figures , the flotage , the graphs , the probable return , the fiscal dinkuin , and all that ? " " I would n't understand it . " " Oh , yes you would . " " Well , I would n't want to understand it . " " No wonder they call you the Vixen of Wall Street . That ice-cold , diamond-sharp business mind  --  it 's frightening . "  | " We 're going a trip , " she said . " We 're going a trip for two days . " And how the hell could a man not love her , not adore her ? " Who is Mary  --  what is she ? " I sang and collected the empty milk bottles and went to work . I felt the need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel of him , but I must have been a moment late or he a momentearly . He was entering the coffee shop when I turned into the High Street . I followed him in and took the stool beside him . " You got me into this habit , Joey . " " Hi , Mr. Hawley . It 's pretty good coffee . " I greeted my old school girl friend . " Morning , Annie . " " You going to be a regular , Eth ? " " Looks like . One cuppa and black . " " Black it is . " " Black as the eye of despair . " " What ? " " Black . " " You see any white in that , Eth , I 'll give you another . " " How are things , Morph ? " " Just the same , only worse . " " Want to trade jobs ? " " I would , just before a long weekend . " " You 're not the only one with problems . People stock up on food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't thought of that . " " Picnic stuff , pickles , sausages , and , God help us , marshmallows . This a big one for you ? " " With the Fourth on Monday and nice weather , you kidding ? And what makes it worse , God Almighty feels the need of rest and recreation in the mountains . " " Mr. Baker ? " " Not James G. Blaine . " " I want to see him . I need to see him . " " Well , try to catch him if you can . He 's jumping like a quarter in a tambourine . "  | " I can bring sandwiches to your battle station , Joey . " " I might just ask you to . " " I pay this time , " I said . " Okay . " We crossed the street together and went into the alley . " You sound lowy , Joey . " " I am . I get pretty tired of other people 's money . I got a hot date for the weekend and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " He nudged a gum wrapper into the lock , went in , saying , " See you , " and closed the door . I pushed the back door open . " Joey ! You want a sandwich today ? " " No thanks , " he called out of the dim , floor-oil-smelling interior . " Maybe Friday , Saturday sure . " " Do n't you close at noon ? " " I told you . The bank closes but Morphy do n't . " " Just call on me . " " Thanks  --  thanks , Mr. Hawley . " I had nothing to say to my forces on the shelves that morning except " Good morning gentlemen  --  at ease ! " At a few moments before nine , aproned and broomed , I was out front , sweeping the sidewalk . Mr. Baker is so regular you can hear him tick and I 'm sure there 's a hairspring in his chest . Eight fifty-six , fiftyseven , there he came down Elm Street ; eight fifty-eight , he crossed ; eight fifty-nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with broom at carry arms , intercepted him . " Mr. Baker , I want to talk to you . " " Morning , Ethan . Can you wait a minute ? Come on in . " I followed him , and it was just as Joey said  --  like a religiousceremony . They practically stood at attention as the clock hand crossed nine . There came a click and buzzing from the great steel safe door . Then Joey dialed the mystic numbers and turned the wheel that drew the bolts . The holy of holies swung stately open and Mr. Baker took the salute of the assembled money . I stood outside the rail like a humble communicant waiting for the sacrament.  |p222Mr  . Baker turned . " Now , Ethan . What can I do for you ? " I said softly , " I want to talk to you privately , and I ca n't leave the store . " " Wo n't it wait ? " " ' Fraid not . " " You ought to have some help . " " I know it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drop over . Any word about Taylor ? " " Not yet . But I 've put out some lines . " " I 'll try to get over . " " Thank you , sir . " But I knew he would come . And he did , in less than an hour , and stood about until the present customers were gone . " Now  --  what is it , Ethan ? " " Mr. Baker , with a doctor or a lawyer or a priest there 's arule of secrecy . Is there such a thing with a banker ? " He smiled . " Have you ever heard a banker discuss aclient 's interests , Ethan ? " " No . " " Well , ask sometime and see how far you get . And besidesthat custom , I 'm your friend , Ethan . " " I know . I guess I 'm a little jumpy . It 's been a long time since I 've had a break . " " A break ? " " I 'll lay them out face up , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close to me . " What kind of trouble ? " " I do n't know exactly , sir . I think it might be illegal entry . " " How do you know ? " " He told me  --  not in so many words . You know how he is . I could almost see his mind leaping about , picking upp225guess you 're right . I should n't gamble with her money . I suppose what I should do is call up the federal men . " " That would lose you any advantage you have . " " How ? " " If he is deported he can sell his holdings through an agent and this store will bring a lot more than you can pay . You do n't know he 's going to jump . How could you tell them he is if you do n't know ? You do n't even know he 's picked up . " " That 's true . " " As a matter of fact , you do n't know anything about him  --  really know . All you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so ? " " Yes . " " And you 'd better forget those . " " Would n't it look bad  --  paying in cash with no record ? " " You could write on the check  --  oh , something like For investment in grocery business with A. Marullo . ' That would be a record of your intention . " " Suppose none of this works . " " Then redeposit the money . " " You think it 's worth the risk ? " " Well  --  everything 's a risk , Ethan . It 's a risk to carry that much money around . " " I 'll take care of that . " " I wish I did n't have to be out of town . " What I said about timing still held . In all that time nobody came into the store , but half a dozen came in now  --  three women , an old man , and two kids . Mr. Baker moved close and spoke softly . " I 'll make it in hundred-dollar bills and note the numbers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He nodded gravely to the three women , said , " Good morning , George , " to the old man , and roughed his fingers through the kids ' coarse hair . Mr. Baker is a very clever man.  |p226JULY  first . It parts the year like the part in a head of hair . I had foreseen it as a boundary marker for me  --  yesterday one kind of me , tomorrow a different kind . I had made my moves that could not be recalled . Time and incidents had played along , had seemed to collaborate with me . I did not ever draw virtue down to hide what I was doing from myself . No one made me take the course I had chosen . Temporarily I traded a habit of conduct and attitude for comfort and dignity and a cushion of security . It would be too easy to agree that I did it for my family because I knew that in their comfort and security I would find my dignity . But my objective was limited and , once achieved , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could . War did not make a killer of me , although for a time I killed men . Sending out patrols , knowing some of the men would die , aroused no joy in sacrifice in me as it did in some , and I could never joy in what I had done , nor excuse or condone it . The main thing was to know the limited objective for what it was , and , once it was achieved , to stop the process in its tracks . But that could only be if I knew what I was doing and did not fool myself  --  security and dignity , and then stop the process in its tracks . I knew from combat that casualties are the victims of a process , not of anger nor of hate or cruelty . And I believe that in the moment of acceptance , betweenp227winner and loser , between killer and killed , there is love . But Danny 's scribbled papers hurt like a sorrow , and Marullo 's grateful eyes . I had not lain awake as men are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came quickly , heavily , completely , and released me just as freely in the predawn , refreshed . I did not lie in the darkness as usual . My urge was to visit my life as it had been . I slipped quietly from bed , dressed in the bathroom , and went down the stairs , walking near to the wall . It did surprise me when I went to the cabinet , unlocked it , and recognized the rosy mound by touch . I put it in my pocket and closed and locked the cabinet . In my whole life I had never carried it away and I had not known I would do it this morning . Memory directed me through the dark kitchen and out the back door into the graying yard . The arching elms were fat with leaves , a true black cave . If I had then had Marullo 's Pontiac I would have driven out of New Baytown to the awakening world of my first memory . My finger traced the endless sinuous design on the flesh-warm talisman in my pocket  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Golgotha was a precise machine with words . She took no nonsense from them nor permitted me a laxity . What power she had , that old woman ! If she wanted immortality , she had it in my brain . Seeing me trace the puzzle with my finger , she said , " Ethan , that outlandish thing could well become your talisman . " " What 's a talisman ? " " If I tell you , your half-attention will only half learn . Look it up . " So many words are mine because Aunt Deborah first aroused my curiosity and then forced me to satisfy it by my own effort . Of course I replied , " Who cares ? " But she knew I would creep to it alone and she spelled it so I could track it down . T-a-l-i-s-m-a-n . She cared deeply about words and she hated their misuse as she would hate the clumsy han/dling of any fine thing . Now , so many cycles later , I can see the page  --  can see myself misspelling " talisman . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the end of it . The Greek I could pronounce because of the blade of that old woman . " A stone or other object engraved with figures or characters to which are attributed the occult powers of the planetary influences and celestial configurations under which it was made , usually worn as an amulet to avert evil from or bring fortune to the bearer . " I had then to look for " occult , " " planetary , " " celestial , " and " amulet . " It was always that way . One word set off others like a string of firecrackers . When later I asked her , " Do you believe in talismans ? " she replied , " What has my belief to do with it ? " I put it in her hands . " What does this figure or character mean ? " " It 's your talisman , not mine . It means what you want it to mean . Put it back in the cabinet . It will wait for you . " Now , as I walked in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as ever she had been and that 's true immortality . Over and under itself the carving went , and around and over and under , a serpent with neither head nor tail nor beginning nor ending . And I had taken it away with me for the first time  --  to avert evil ? To bring fortune ? I do n't believe in fortune-tellingeither , and immortality has always felt to me like a sickly promise for the disappointed . The light-rimmed boundary of the east was July , for June had gone away in the night . July is brass where June is gold , and lead where June is silver . July leaves are heavy and fat and crowding . Birdsong of July is a flatulent refrain without passion , for the nests are empty now and dumpy fledglings teeter clumsily . No , July is not a month of promise or of fulfillment . Fruit is growing but unsweet and uncolored , corn is a limp green bundle with a young and yellow tassel . The squashes still wear umbilical crowns of dry blossom.  |p229I  walked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gathering brass of dawn showed rosebushes heavy with middle-aged blooms , like women whose corseting no longer conceals a thickening stomach , no matter how pretty their legs may remain . Walking slowly , I found myself not saying but feeling good-by  --  not farewell . Farewell has a sweet sound of reluctance . Good-by is short and final , a word with teeth sharp to bite through the string that ties past to the future . I came to the Old Harbor . Good-by to what ? I do n't know . I could n't remember . I think I wanted to go to the Place , but man commensal with the sea would know that the tide was at flood and the Place under dark water . Last night I saw the moon only four days grown like a thickened , curved surgeon 's needle , but strong enough to pull the tide into the cave mouth of the Place . No need to visit Danny 's shack in hope . The light had come enough to see the grasses standing upright in the path where Danny 's feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer craft , slim hulls with sails covered in grommeted coats of canvas , and here and there a morning man made ready , clearing boom and coiling jib- and mainsheets , unbagging his Genoa like a great white rumpled nest . The new harbor was busier . Charter boats tied close for boarding passengers , the frantic summer fishermen who pay a price and glut the decks with fish and in the afternoon wonder vaguely what to do with them , sacks and baskets and mountains of porgies and blows and blackfish , sea robins , and even slender dogfish , all to be torn up greedily , to die , and to be thrown back for the waiting gulls . The gulls swarm and wait , knowing the summer fishermen will sicken of their plenty . Who wants to clean and scale a sack of fish ? It 's harder to give away fish than it is to catch them . The bay was oil-smooth now and the brass light pouredp230over it . The cans and nuns stood unswaying on the channel edge , each one with its mirror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned at the flagpole and war memorial and found my name among the surviving heroes , the letters picked out in silver  --  CAPT . E. A. HAwley  --  and below in gold the names of the eighteen New Baytown men who did n't make it home . I knew the names of most of them and ' once I knew the men  --  no different then from the rest , but different now in gold . For a brief moment I wished I could be with them in the lower files , Capt . E. A. Hawley in gold , the slobs and malingerers , the cowards and the heroes all lumped together in gold . Not only the brave get killed , but the brave have a better chance at it . Fat Willie drove up and parked beside the monument and took the flag from the seat beside him . " Hi , Eth , " he said . He shackled the brass grommets and raised the flag slowly to the top of the staff , where it slumped limp as a hanged man . " She barely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Look at her . Two more days for her , and then the new one goes up . " " The fifty-star ? " " You bet . We got a nylon , big devil , twice as big as this and do n't weigh no more than half . " " How 's tricks , Willie ? " " I ca n't complain  --  but I do . This glorious Fourth is always a mess . Coming on a Monday , there 'll be just that much more accidents and fights and drunks  --  out-of-town drunks . Want a lift up to the store ? " " Thanks . I 've got to stop at the post office and I thought I 'd get a cup of coffee . " " Okay . I 'll ride you . I 'd even coffee you but Stoney 's mean as a bull bitch . " " What 's his problem ? " " God knows . Went away a couple of days and he come back mean and tough . "  | " Where 'd he go ? " " He did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll wait while you get your mail . " " Do n't bother , Willie . I 've got to address some things . " " Suit yourself . " He backed out and slid away up the High Street . The post office was still dusky and the floor newly oiled , and a sign up : DANGER . SLICK FLOOR . We 'd had Number 7 drawer since the old post office was built . I dialed G I/z R and took out a pile of plans and promises addressed to " Box-Holder . " And that 's all there was  --  wastebasket fodder . I strolled up the High , intending to have a cup of coffee , but at the last moment I did n't want it , or did n't want to talk , or  --  I do n't know why . I just did n't want to go to the Foremaster coffee shop . Good God , what a mess of draggle-tail impulses a man is  --  and a woman too , I guess . I was sweeping the sidewalk when Mr. Baker ticked out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time lock . And I was halfheartedly arranging muskmelons in the doorway stands when the old-fashioned green armored car pulled up in front of the bank . Two guards armed like commandosgot out of the back and carried gray sacks of money into the bank . In about ten minutes they came out and got into the riveted fortress and it drove away . I guess they had to stand by while Morph counted it and Mr. Baker checked and gave a receipt . It 's an awful lot of trouble taking care of money . As Morph says , you could get a downright distaste for other people 's money . And by the size and weight , the bank must have anticipated a large holiday withdrawal . If I was a run-of-the-mill bank robber , now would be the time to stick it up . But I was n't a run-of-the-mill bank robber . I owed everything I knew to Pal Joey . He could have been a great one if he had wished . I did wonder why he did n't want to , just to try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was worse than I hadp232thought it might be . The sun turned hot and fierce and very little wind moved , the kind of weather that drives people on their vacations whether they want to go or not . I had a line of customers waiting to be served . One thing I knew , come hell or high water , I had to get some help . If Allen did n't work out , I 'd fire him and get someone else . When Mr. Baker came in about eleven , he was in a hurry . I had to stand off some customers and go into the storeroom with him . He put a big envelope and a small one in my hands , and he was so rushed that he barked a kind of shorthand . " Tom Watson says the deed 's okay . He does n't know whether it 's papered . He does n't think so . Here are conveyances . Get signatures where I 've checked . The money 's marked and the numbers noted . Here 's a check all made out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ethan . I hate doing business like this . " " You really think I should go ahead ? " " Goddammit , Ethan , after all the trouble I 've gone to  --  " " Sorry , sir . Sorry . I know you 're right . " I put the check on a canned-milk carton and signed it with my indelible pencil . Mr. Baker was n't too rushed to inspect the check . " Offer two thousand at first . And raise your offer two hundred at a time . You realize , of course , you 've only got a five-hundred balance in the bank . God help you if you run short . " " If it 's clear , ca n't I borrow on the store ? " " Sure you can if you want interest to eat you up . " " I do n't know how to thank you . " " Do n't go soft , Ethan . Do n't let him poor-mouth you . He can be a spellbinder . All dagos can . Just remember number one . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go , " he said . " Want to hit the highway before the noon traffic . " And out he went and nearly knocked Mrs. Willow down in the doorway where she had been over every cantaloupe twice. p 233The day did n't get any less frantic . I guess the heat that splashed the streets made people edgy and downright quarrelsome . Instead of a holiday , you 'd have thought they were stocking up for a catastrophe . I could n't have got a sandwichover to the Morph if I 'd wanted to . I not only had to wait on people , I had to keep my eyes open . A lot of the customers were summer people , strangers in town , and they steal if you do n't watch them . They ca n't seem to help it . And it 's not always stuff they need either . The little jars of luxuries take the worst beating , foie gras and caviar and button mushrooms . That 's why Marullo had me keep such stuff back of the counter , where the customersare n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good business to catch a shoplifter . Makes everyone restless , maybe because  --  well , in his thoughts anyway  --  everyone is guilty . About the only way is to charge the loss off to somebody else . But if I saw someone drifting too close to certain shelves , I could forestall the impulse by saying , " Those cocktailonions are a bargain . " I 've seen the customer jump as though I 'd read his mind . What I hate worst about it is the suspicion . It 's unpleasant to be suspicious . Makes me angry , as though one person were injuring many . The day wore on to a kind of sadness , and time slowed clown . After five Chief Stoney came in , lean and grim and ulcerish . He bought a TV dinner  --  country steak , carrots , mashed potatoes , cooked and frozen in a kind of aluminum tray . I said , " You look like you had a touch of sun , Chief . " " Well , I ai n't . I feel fine . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Just one . My wife 's gone visiting . A cop do n't get holi-days . " " Too bad . " " Maybe it 's just as well . With this mob hanging around , I do n't get home much . " " I heard you were away . "  | " Who told you ? " " Willie . " " He better learn to keep his big mouth shut . " " He did n't mean harm . " " Has n't got brains enough to mean harm . Maybe not brains enough to stay out of jail . " " Who has ? " I said it on purpose and-I got even more responsethan I had anticipated . " Just what do you mean by that , Ethan ? " " I mean we 've got so many laws you ca n't breathe withoutbreaking something . " " That 's the truth . Gets so you do n't really know . " " I was going to ask you , Chief  --  cleaning up , I found an old revolver , all dirty and rusty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure is n't mine . What do I do with it ? " " Turn it over to me , if you do n't want to apply for a li-cense . " " I 'll bring it down from home tomorrow . I stuck it in a can of oil . What do you do with things like that , Stoney ? " " Oh , check to see if they 're hot and . then throw them in the ocean . " He seemed to be feeling better , but it had been a long , hot day . I could n't let him be . " Remember a couple of years ago there was a case somewhereupstate ? Police were selling confiscated guns . " Stoney smiled the sweet smile of an alligator and with the same gay innocence .

I want to be . Eth  --  do you think it 's right to make a man tell on his friends to save himself ? " " No , I do n't . " " Neither do I. I ca n't admire such a government .

I guess he is a good officer . I wonder where the line falls . I was closing up shop , drawing in the fruit bins from the doorway , when Joey Morphy sauntered in . " Quick !

" " Once I knew a postmaster , little town . Had a punk kid working there , name of Ralph  --  pale hair , glasses , little tinyp237chin , adenoids big as goiters .

I could n't take the time . " " Have to in a bank . You only lose once . All it needs is a whisper . " " Do n't tell me you 're suspicious . " " It 's an instinct . If anything 's just a little bit out of norm , my alarm goes off . " " What a way to live ! You do n't really mean that . " " I guess I do n't . I just thought if you 'd heard something , you 'd tell me  --  that is , if it was any of my business . " " I think I 'd tell anybody anything I know . Maybe that 's why nobody ever tells me anything . Going home ? " " No , I think I 'll go eat across the street . " I switched the front lights off . " Mind coming out through the alley ? Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rush . One ham , one cheese on rye bread , lettuce and mayonnaise , right ? And a quart of milk . " " You ought to work in a bank , " he said . I guess he was n't any lonelier than anybody else just because he lived alone . He left me at the door of the Foremasterand for a moment I wished I could go with him . I thought home might be a mess . And it was . Mary had planned the trip . Out near MontaukPoint there 's a dude ranch with all the fancy fixings you see in what they call adult Westerns . The joke is that it 's the oldest working cattle ranch in America . It was a cattle ranch before Texas was discovered . First charter came " I do n't understand . " " I do n't much either , sweetheart . " " If there was only someone who could stay with them . " " Repeat , please , Columbine ! " " How I would love to take a holiday just with you . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unattached elderly female relatives . Put your mind to it . If only we could can them or salt ' or pickle them for a little while . Mary , madonna , put your mind to it . I ache to be alone with you in a strange place . We could walk the dunes and swim naked at night and I would tousle you in a fern bed . " " Darling , I know , darling . I know its been hard on you . Do n't think I do n't know . " " Well , hold me close . Let 's think of some way . " " You 're still shivering . Do you feel cold ? " " Cold and hot , full and empty  --  and tired . " " I 'll try to think of something . I really will . Of course I love them but  --  " " I know , and I could wear my bow tie  --  " " Will they put them in jail ? " " I wish we could  --  " " Those men ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't even appear beforenext Tuesday , and Thursday is election . That 's what it 's for . " " Ethan , that 's cynical . You are n't like that . We 'll have to go away if you 're getting cynical because  --  that was n't a joke , the way you said it . I know your jokes . You meant that . " A fear struck me . I was showing through . I could n't let myself show through . " Oh say , Miss Mousie will you marry me ? " And Mary said , " Oho ! Oho ! " My sudden fear that I might be showing through was very great . I had made myself believe that the eyes are notp241the minor of the soul . Some of the deadliest little female contraptions I ever saw had the faces and the eyes of angels . There is a breed that can read through skin and through bone right into the center , but they are rare . For the most part people are not curious except about themselves . Once a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had bitten her and the telling bit me . She said that in the age of growing up when she felt that all eyes were on her and not favorably , so that she went from blushes to tears and back again , her Highland grandfather , observing her pain , said sharply . " Ye wouldna be sae worrit wi ' what folk think about ye if ye kenned how seldom they do . " It cured her and the telling reassured me of privacy , because it 's true . But Mary , who ordinarily lives in a house of flowers of her own growing , had heard a tone , or felt a cutting wind . This was a danger , until tomorrow should be over . If my plan had leaped up full-grown and deadly I would have rejected it as nonsense . People do n't do such things , but people play secret games . Mine began with Joey 's rules for robbing a bank . Against the boredom of my job I played with it and everything along the way fell into it  --  Allen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , holiday coming up , Joey wadding paper in the lock of the alley door . As a game I timed the process , enacted it , tested it . But gunmen shooting it out with cops  --  are n't they the little boys who practiced quick draws with cap pistols until they got so good they had to use the skill ? I do n't know when my game stopped being a game . Perhapswhen I knew I might buy the store and would need money to run it . For one thing , it is hard to throw away a perfect structure without testing it . And as for the dishonesty , the crime  --  it was not a crime against men , only against money . No one would get hurt . Money is insured . The real crimes were against men , against Danny and against Marullo . If I could do what I had done , theft was nothing . And all of it was temporary . None of it would ever have to bep242repeated . Actually , before I knew it was not a game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as possible . The cap-pistol boy found a .45 in his hand . Of course an accident was possible but that is so in crossing the street or walking under a tree . I do n't think I had any fear . I had rehearsed that out of me , but I did have a breathlessness , like the stage fright of an actor standing in the wings on his opening night . And it was like a play in that every conceivable mischance had been inspected and eliminated . In my worry that I would not sleep , I slept , deeply and as far as I know without dreams , and overslept . I had planned to use the dark pre-day for the calming medicine of contemplation . Instead , when my eyes jerked open , the tail of the cow in the lake had been visible at least half an hour . I awakened with a jar like the blow of driven air from high explosive . Sometimes such an awakening sprains muscles . Mine shook the bed so that Mary awakened , saying , " What 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nonsense . It 's early . " " No , my ablative absolute . This is a monster day for me . The world will be grocery-happy today . Do n't you get up . " " You 'll need a good breakfast . " " Know what I 'll do ? I 'll get a carton of coffee at the Foremasterand I 'll raven Marullo 's shelves like a wolf . " " You will ? " " Rest , little mouse of a mouseness , and try to find a way for us to escape from our darling children . We need that . I mean it . " " I know we do . I 'll try to think . " I was dressed and gone before she could suggest any of the seasonal things for my protection and comfort . Joey was in the coffee shop and he patted the stool beside him.  | " Ca n't , Morph . I 'm late . Annie , could you give me a quart of coffee in a carton ? " " It 'll have to be two pints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She filled and covered the little paper buckets and put them in a bag . Joey finished and walked across with me . " You 'll have to say mass without the bishop this morn-ing . " " Guess so . Say , how about that news ? " " I ca n't take it in . " " You remember I said I smelled something . " " I thought about that when I heard it . You 've got quite a nose . " " It 's part of the trade . Baker can come back now . Wonderif he will . " " Come back ? " " You get no smell there ? " I looked at him helplessly . " I 'm missing something and I do n't even know what it is . " " Jesus God . " " You mean I should see something ? " " That 's what I mean . The law of the fang is not re-pealed . " " Oh , Lord ! There must be a whole world I miss . I was trying to remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Both . " He stripped the cellophane cover from his pack of Camels and wadded it to push in the lock . " Got to go , " I said . " We 've got a special sale on tea . Send in a box top , you get a baby ! Know any ladies ? " " I sure do , and that 's about the last prize they want . Do n't bother to bring them , I 'll come for the sandwiches . " He went in his door and there was no click of the spring lock . I did hope that Joey never discovered that he was thep244best teacher I had ever had . He not only informed , he demonstratedand , without knowing it , prepared a way for me . Everyone who knew about such things , the experts , agreed that only money gets money . The best way is always the simplest . The shocking simplicity of the thing was its greatest strength . But I really believe it was only a detailed daydream until Marullo through none of his fault @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seemed almostcertainthat I could get the store for my own , only then did the high-flown dreaming come down to earth . A good but illinformedquestion might be : If I could get the store , why did I need money ? Mr. Baker would understand , so would Joey  --  so , for that matter , would Marullo . The store without running capital was worse than no store at all . The Appian Way of bankruptcy is lined with the graves of unprotected ventures . I have one grave there already . The silliest soldier would not throw his whole strength at a break-through withoutmortars or reserves or replacements , but many a horning business does just that . Mary 's money in marked bills bulged against my bottom in my hip pocket , but Marullo would take as much of that as he could get . Then the first of the month . The wholesale houses are not openhanded with credit for unproved organizations . Therefore I would still need money , and that money was waiting for me behind ticking steel doors . The process of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when inspected . That robberywas unlawful troubled me very little . Marullo was no problem . If he were not the victim he might have planned it himself . Danny was troubling , even though I could with perfect truth assume that he was finished anyway . Mr. Baker 's ineffectual attempt to do the same thing to Danny gave me more justification than most men need . But Danny remained a burning in my guts and I had to accept that as one accepts a wound in successful combat . I had to live with that , but maybe it would heal in time or be walled off withp245forgetfulness the way a shell fragment gets walled off with cartilage . The immediate was the money , and that move was as carefully prepared and timed as an electric circuit . The Morphy laws stood up well and I remembered them and had even added one . First law : Have no past record . Well , I had none . Number two : No accomplices or confidants . I certainly had none . Number three : No dames . Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be called a dame , and I was not about to drink champagneout of her slipper . Number four : Do n't splurge . Well , I would n't . Gradually I would use it to pay bills to wholesalers . I had a place for it . In my Knight Templar 's hatbox there was a support of velvet-covered cardboard , the size and shape of my head . This was already lifted free and the edges coated with contact cement so it could be restored in an instant . Recognition  --  a Mickey Mouse mask . No one would see anything else . An old cotton raincoat of Marullo 's  --  all tan cotton raincoats look alike  --  and a pair of those tear-off cellophanegloves that come on a roll . The mask had been cut several days ago and the box and cereal flushed down the toilet , as the mask and gloves would be . The old silvered Iver Johnson pistol was smoked with lampblack and in the toilet was a can of crankcase oil to throw it in for delivery to Chief Stoney at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Do n't be a pig . Do n't take too much and avoid large bills . If somewhere about six to ten thousand in tens and twenties were available , that would be enough and easy to handle and to hide . A cardboardcakebox on the cold counter would be the swap bag and when next seen it would have a cake in it . I had tried that terrible reedy ventriloquism thing to change my voice and had given it up for silence and gestures . Everything in place and ready.  |p246I  was almost sorry Mr. Baker was n't here . There would be only Morph and Harry Robbit and Edith Alden . It was planned to the split second . At five minutes to nine I would place the broom in the entrance . I 'd practiced over and over . Apron tucked up , scale weight on the toilet chain to keep it flushing . Anyone who came in would hear the water and draw his own conclusion . Coat , mask , cakebox , gun , gloves . Cross the alley on the stroke of nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , enter just after timeclock buzzes and Joey swings open the door . Motion the three to lie down , with the gun . They 'd give no trouble . As Joey said , the money was insured , he was n't . Pick up the money , put it in cakebox , cross alle 0 .. - ; loves and mask down toilet , put gun in can of oil coat off . ' pron down , money in hatbox , cake in cakebox , pick up room , and go on sweeping sidewalk , available and visible when the alarm came . The whole thing one minute and forty seconds , timed , checked , and rechecked . But carefully as I had planned and timed , I still felt a little breathless and I swept out the store prior to opening the two front doors . I wore yesterday 's apron so that new wrinkles would not be noticeable . And would you believe it , time stood still as though a Joshua in a wing collar had shot the sun in its course . The minute hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and resisted morning . It was long since I had addressed my flock aloud , but this morning I did , perhaps out of nervousness . " My friends , " I said , " what you are about to witness is a mystery . I know I can depend on you to keep silent . If any of you have any feeling about the moral issue involved , I challenge you and will ask you to leave . " I paused . " No objections ? Very well . If I ever hear of an oyster or a cabbage discussing this with strangers , the sentence is death by dinner fork . " And I want to thank you all . We have been together , humble workers in the vineyard , and I a servant as you arc.  |p247But  now a change is coming . I will be master here henceforth , but I promise I will be a good and kind and understandingmaster . The time approaches , my friends , the curtainrises  --  farewell . " And as I moved to the front doors with the broom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Danny ! Get out of my guts . " A great shudder shook me so that I had to lean on the broom a moment before I opened up the doors . My father 's watch said nine with its black , stumpy hour hand and minus six with its long , thin minute hand . I could feel its heart beat against my palm as I looked at it.  |p248IT  WAS a day as different from other days as dogs are from cats and both of them from chrysanthemums or tidal waves or scarlet fever . It is the law in many states , certainly in ours , that it must rain on long holiday weekends , else how could the multitudes get drenched and miserable ? The July sun fought off a multitude of little feathered clouds and drove them scuttling , but thunderheads looked over the western rim , the strong-arm rain-bearers from the HudsonRiver Valley , armed with lightning and already mumbling to themselves . If the law was properly obeyed , they would hold back until a maximum number of ant-happy humans were on the highways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other stores did not open until nine-thirty . It had been Marullo 's thought to catch a pinch of trade by having me jump the gun half an hour . I thought I would change that . It caused more ill feeling among the other stores than the profit justified . Marullo did n't care about that , if he ever knew about it . He was a foreigner , a wop , a criminal , a tyrant , a squeezer of the poor , a bastard , and eight kinds of son of a bitch . I having destroyed him , it was only natural that his faults and crimes should become blindinglyapparent to me . I felt old long hand edging around on my father 's watchp249and I found I was sweeping viciously with tensed muscles , waiting for the moment of swift , smooth movement of my mission . I breathed through my mouth , and my stomach pushed against my lungs as I remember it did waiting for an attack . For **39;3173;TOOLONG , there were few people about . A stranger  --  old man  --  went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tackle box . He was on his way to the town pier to sit all day dangling a limp strip of squid in the water . He did n't even look up , but I forced his attention . " Hope you catch some big ones . " " Never catch anything , " he said . " Stripers come in sometimes . " " I do n't believe it . " A red-hot optimist , but at least I had set the hook in his attention . And Jennie Single rolled along the sidewalk . She moved as though she had casters instead of feet , probably New Baytown 's least reliable witness . Once she turned on her gas oven and forgot to light it . She 'd have blown herself through the roof if she could have remembered where she had put the matches . " Morning , Miss Jenny . " " Good morning , Danny . " " I 'm Ethan . " " Course you are . I 'm going to bake a cake . " I tried to gouge a scar in her memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Fannie Farmer but the label fell off the packageso I really do n't know . " What a witness she would make , if I needed a witness . And why did she say " Danny " ? A piece of tinfoil on the pavement resisted the broom . I had to stoop down and lift it with a fingernail . Those assistant bank mice were really mousing the hour with Cat Baker away . They were the ones I wanted . It was less thanp250one minute to nine when they burst from the coffee shop and sprinted across the street . " Run  --  run  --  run ! " I called and they grinned self-consciouslyas they charged the bank doors . Now it was time . I must not think of the whole thing  --  just one step at a time and each in its place , as I had practiced . I folded my anxious stomach down where it belonged . First lean the broom against the doorjamb where it could be seen . I moved with slow , deliberate speed . From the corner of my eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paused to let it go by . " Mr. Hawley ! " I whirled the way cornered gangsters do in the movies . A dusty dark green Chevrolet had slid to the curb and , great God ! that Ivy League government man was getting out . My stone-built earth shuddered like a reflection in water . Paralyzed , I saw him cross the pavement . It seemed to take ages , but it was simple as that . My long-planned perfect structure turned to dust before my eyes the way a long-buried artifact does when the air strikes it . I thought of rushing for the toilet and going through with it . It would n't work . I could n't repeal the Morphy law . Thought and light must travel at about the same speed . It 's a shock to throw out a plan so long considered , so many times enacted that its consummation is just one more repetition , but I tossed it out , threw it away , closed it off . I had no choice . And light-speed thought said , Thank God he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been the fatal accident they write about in crime stories . And all this while the young man moved stiffly four steps across the pavement . Something must have showed through to him . " What 's the matter , Mr. Hawley ? You look sick . " " Skitters , " I said . " That 'll wait for no man . Run for it . I 'll wait . " I dashed for the toilet , closed the door , and pulled thep251chain to make a rush of water . I had n't switched on the light . I sat there in the dark . My quaking stomach played along . In a moment I really had to go , and I did , and slowly the beating pressure in me subsided . I added a bylawto the Morphy code . In case of accident , change your plan  --  instantly . It has happened to me before that in crisis or great dangerI have stepped out and apart and as an interested strangerwatched myself , my movements and my mind , but immune to the emotions of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other person fold his perfect plan and put it in a box and close the lid and shove the thing not only out of sight but out of thought . I mean that by the time I stood up in the darkness and zipped and smoothed and laid my hand on the flimsy plywood door , I was a grocery clerk prepared for a busy day . It was no secretiveness . It was really so . I wondered what the young man wanted , but only with the pale apprehension that comes from a low-grade fear of cops . " Sorry to keep you waiting , " I said . " Ca n't remember what I ate to cause that . " " There 's a virus going around , " he said . " My wife had it last week . " " Well , this virus carried a gun . I nearly got caught short . What can I do for you ? " He seemed embarrassed , apologetic , almost shy . " A guy does funny things , " he said . I overcame an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm glad I did because his next words were , " In my business you meet all kinds . " I walked behind the counter and kicked the leather Knight Templar hatbox closed . And I leaned my elbows on the counter . Very odd . Five minutes earlier I saw myself through the eyes of other people . I had to . ' What they saw was important . And as he came across the pavement , this man hadp252been a huge , dark , hopeless fate , an enemy , an ogre . But with my project tucked away and gone as a part of me , I saw him now as an object apart  --  no longer linked with me for good or bad . He was , I think , about my age , but shaped in a school , a manner , perhaps a cult  --  a lean face and hair carefully trimmed short and standing straight up , white shirt of a coarse woven linen with the collar buttoned down and a tie chosen by his wife , and without doubt patted ' and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suit a gray darkness and his nails home cared for but well cared for , a wide gold wedding ring on his left hand , a tiny bar in his buttonhole , a suggestion of the decoration he would not wear . His mouth and dark blue eyes were schooled to firmness , which made it all the more strange that they were not firm now . In some way a hole had been opened in him . He was not the same man whose questions had been short , squared bars of steel spaced perfectly , one below its fellow . " You were here before , " I said . " What is your business ? " " Department of Justice . " " Your business is justice ? " He smiled . " Yes , at least that 's what I hope . But I 'm not on official business  --  not even sure the department would approve . But it 's my day off . " " What can I do for you ? " " It 's kind of complicated . Do n't know quite where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hawley , I 've been in the service twelve years and I 've never had anything like this before . " " Maybe if you tell me what it is I can help you do it . " He smiled at me . " Hard to set it up . I 've been driving three hours from New York and I 've got to drive three hours back in holiday traffic . " " Sounds serious . " " It is . " " I think you said your name was Walder . " " Richard Walder . " " I 'm going to be swamped with customers , Mr. Walder.  |p253Do  n't know why they have n't started . Hot-dog-and-relish trade . You 'd better start . Am I in trouble ? " " In my job you meet all kinds . Tough ones , liars , cheats , hustlers , stupid , bright . Mostly you can get mad at them , get an attitude to carry you through . Do you see ? " " No , I guess not . Look , Walder , what in hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've talked to Mr. Baker at the bank . You 're after Mr. Marullo , my boss . " " And I got him , " he said softly . " What for ? " " Illegal entry . It 's not my doing . They throw me a dossier and I follow it up . I do n't judge him or try him . " " He 'll be deported ? " " Yes . " " Can he make a fight ? Can I help him ? " " No . He does n't want to . He 's pleading guilty . He wants to go . " " Well , I 'll be damned ! " Six or eight customers came in . " I warned you , " I called to him , and I helped them select what they needed or thought they did . Thank heaven I had ordered a mountain of hot-dog and hamburger rolls . Walder called , " What do you get for piccalilli ? " " It 's marked on the label . " " Thirty-nine cents , ma'am , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bagging , adding . He reached in front of me to ring up cash on the register . When he moved away I took a bag from the pile , opened the drawer , and , using the bag like a potholder , I picked up the old revolver , took it back to the toilet , and dropped it in the can of crankcase oil that waited for it . " You 're good at this , " I said when I came back . " I used to have a job at Grand Union after school . " " It shows . " " Do n't you have anybody to help ? " " I 'm going to bring my boy in. "  |p254Customers  always come in coveys , never in evenly spaced singles . A clerk gets set in the interval to meet the next flight .

I was speaking to my friend . " " Oh , yes . Of course . Well , there are five of us  --  three children . How many frankfurters will I need ? " " Five apiece for the children , three for your husband , two for you . That 's twenty . " " You think they 'll eat five ? " " They think they will . Is it a picnic ? " " Uh-huh .

" This was interspersed with customers so it did n't build to a dramatic climax  --  just a series of short statements . " That 's why he was n't hurt when somebody turned him in . " Turned him in ? " " Sure . All it takes is a telephone call . " " Who did that ? " " Who knows ? The department 's a machine . You set the dials and it follows through all the steps like an automatic washer . " " Why did n't he run for it ? " " He 's tired , right to his bones he 's tired . And he 's disgusted . He 's got some money . He wants to go back to Sicily . " " I still do n't get it about the store . " " He 's like me . I can take care of chiselers . That 's my job . An honest man gums up my works , throws me sky high . That 's what happened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , did n't steal , did n't whine , did n't chisel . He tried to teach the sucker to take care of himself in the land of the free but the boob could n't learn . For a long time you scared him . He tried to figure out your racket , and he discovered your racket was honesty . " " Suppose he was wrong ? " " He does n't think he was . He wants to make you a kind of monument to something he believed in once . I 've got the conveyance out in the car . All you have to do is file it . " " I do n't understand it . "  | " I do n't know whether I do or not . You know how he talks  --  like corn popping . I 'm trying to translate what he tried to explain . It 's like a man is made a certain way with a certain direction . If he changes that , something blows , he strips a gear , he gets sick . It 's like a  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay for a violation . You 're his down payment , kind of , so the light wo n't go out . " " Why did you drive out here ? " " Do n't know exactly . Had to  --  maybe  --  so the light wo n't go out . " " Oh , God ! " The store clouded up with clamoring kids and damp women . There would n't be any more uncluttered moments until noon at least . Walder went out to his car , and came back and parted a wave of frantic summer wives to get to the counter . He laid down one of those hard board bellows envelopes tied with a tape . " Got to go . Four hours ' drive with this traffic . My wife 's mad . She said it could wait . But it could n't wait . " " Mister , I been waiting ten minutes to get waited on . " " Be right with you , ma'am . " " I asked him if he had any message and he said , Tell him good-by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him good-by . " The wave of ill-disguised stomachs closed in again and it was just as well for me . I dropped the envelope in the drawer below the cash register and with it  --  desolation.  |p257THE  day went quickly and yet was endless . Closing time had no relation to opening time , so long ago it was that I could hardly remember it . Joey came in as I was about to close the front doors and without asking him I punched a beer can and handed it to him , and then I opened one for myself and I have never done that before . I tried to tell him about Marullo and the store , and found I could not , not even the story I had accepted in exchange for the truth . " You look tired , " he said . " I guess I am . Look at those shelves  --  stripped . They bought things they did n't want and did n't need . " I unloadedthe cash register into the gray canvas bag , added the money Mr. Baker had brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tied up the bag with a piece of string . " You ought n't to leave that around . " " Maybe not . I hide it . Want another beer ? " " Sure . " " Me too . " " You 're too good an audience , " he said . " I get to believingmy own stories . " " Like what ? " " Like my triple-deck instincts . I had one this morning . Woke up with it . Guess I dreamed it , but it was realp258strong , hair on the back of my neck and everything . I did n't think the bank was going to get stuck up today . I knew it . I knew it , lying in bed . We keep little wedges under the foot alarms so we wo n't tramp them by mistake . First thing this morning I took them out . I was that sure of it , braced for it . Now how do you explain that ? " " Maybe somebody planned it and you read his mind and he gave it up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to guess wrong with honor . " " How do you figure it ? " " God knows . I think I 've been Mr. Know-It-All to youso much I got to believe it . But it sure shook me up . " " You know , Morph , I 'm too tired even to sweep out . " " Do n't leave that dough here tonight . Take it home . " " Okay , if you say so . " " I still got the feeling something 's screwy . " I opened the leather box and put the money sack in with my plumed hat and strapped it closed . Joey , watching me , said , " I 'm going in to New York and get a room at a hotel and I 'm going to watch the waterfall across Times Square for two solid days with my shoes off . " " With your date ? " " I called that off . I 'll order up a bottle of whisky and a dame . Do n't have to talk to either of them . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little trip . " " Hope so . You need it . Ready to go ? " " Couple of things to do . You go on , Joey . Get your shoes off . " First thing to do was to call Mary and tell her I had to be a little late . " Yes , but hurry , hurry , hurry . News , news , news . " " Ca n't you tell me now , sweetheart ? " " No . I want to see your face . " tI hung the Mickey Mouse mask on the cash register by its rubber band so that it covered the little window where the numbers show . Then I put on my coat and hat andp259turned out the lights and sat on the counter with my legs dangling . A naked black banana stalk nudged me on one side and the cash register fitted against my left shoulder like a bookend . The shades were up so that the summer late light strained through the crossed-wire grating , and it was very quiet , a quiet like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I felt in my left side pocket for the lump the cash register pushed against me . The talisman  --  I held it in my two hands and stared down at it . I had thought I needed it yesterday . Had I forgot to put it back or was my keeping it with me no accident ? I do n't know . As always it put its power on me as I traced its design with my finger . At midday it was the pink of a rose , but in the evening it picked up a darker tone , a purplish blush as though a little blood had got in it . It was n't thought I needed but rearrangement , change of design , as though I were in a garden from which the house had been moved in the night . Some kind of makeshifthad to be set up to shelter me until I could rebuild . I had retired into busyness until I could let new things enter slowly and count and identify them as they came . The shelves , all day assaulted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hungry horde , a snaggle-toothed effect , a walled town after artillery fire . " Let us pray for our departed friends , " I said . " The thin red line of catsup , the gallant pickles and condiments down to the small bald capers of vinegar . We can not dedicate , we can not consecrate  --  no not that . It is rather to us the living  --  no not that . Alfio  --  I wish you luck and surcease from pain . You are wrong , of course , but wrongness can be a poultice to you . You made a sacrifice for having been a sacrifice . " People passing in the street flickered the light inside the store . I dug back in the debris of the day for Walder 's words and for his face when he said them : " A do-it-yourself police court . You have to pay for a violation . You 're his downp260payment , kind of , so the light wo n't go out . " That 's what the man said . Walder in his safe world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So the light wo n't go out . Did Alfio say it that way ? Walder did n't know , but he did know that 's what Marullo meant . I traced the serpent on the talisman and came back to the beginning , which was the end . That was an old lights  --  Marulli three thousand years ago found their way through the lupariae to the Lupercal on the Palatine to offer a votive to Lycean Pan , protector of the flocks from wolves . And that light had not gone out . Marullo , the dago , the wop , the guinea , sacrificed to the same god for the same reason . I saw him again raise his head out of the welter of fat neck and aching shoulders , I saw the noble head , the hot eyes  --  and the light . I wondered what my payment would be and when demanded . If I took my talisman down to the Old Harbor and threw it in the sea  --  would that be acceptable ? I did not draw the shades . On long holidays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The storeroom was dark . I locked the alley door and was halfway across the street when I remembered the hatbox behind the counter . I did not go back for it . It would be a kind of question asked . The wind was soak the vacationers . I thought to put out the milk for that gray cat on Tuesday and invite it in to be a guest in my store.  |p261I  DO N'T know for sure how other people are inside  --  all differentand all alike at the same time . I can only guess . But I do know how I will squirm and wriggle to avoid a hurtful truth and , when finally there is no choice , will put it off , hoping it will go away . Do other people say primly , " I 'll think about that tomorrow when I am rested , " and then draw on a hoped-for future or an edited past like a child playing with violence against the inevitability of bedtime ? My dawdled steps toward home led through a minefield of the truth . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not unnatural to run for a safe anchorage in the past . But on that course , set square across it was Aunt Deborah , a great wing shot on a covey of lies , her eyes gleaming question marks . I had looked in the window of the jewelry store at expandingwatch bands and glasses frames as long as was decent . The humid , windy evening was breeding a thunderstorm . There were many like Great-Aunt Deborah early in the last century , islands of curiosity and knowledge . Maybe it was being cut off from a world of peers that drove the few into books or perhaps it was the endless waiting , sometimes three years , sometimes forever , for the ships to come home , that pushed them into the kind of books that filled ourp262attic . She was the greatest of great-aunts , a sibyl and a pythoness in one , said magic nonsense words to me , which kept their magic but not their nonsense when I tracked them down . " Me beswac fah wyrm thurh faegir word , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leo gif heo blades onbirigth abit aerest hire ladteow . " Wonder-words they must be , since I still remember them . The Town Manager of New Baytown went crab-scuttling by me , head down , and only gave me good evening in return for mine first offered . I could feel my house , the old Hawley house , from half a block away . Last night it huddled in a web of gloom but this thunder-bordered eve it radiated excitement . A house , like an opal , takes on the colors of the day . Antic Mary heard my footsteps on the walk and she flickered out the screen door like a flame . " You 'll never guess ! " she said , and her hands were out , palms in , as though she carried a package . It was in my mind so I replied " Seo leo gif heo blades onbirigth abit aerest hire ladteow . " " Well , that 's a pretty good guess but it 's not right . " " Some secret admirer has given us a dinosaur . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And I wo n't tell till you wash up , because you 'll have to be clean to hear it . " " What I hear is the love music of a blue-bottom baboon . " And I did  --  it blatted from the living room , where Allen importuned his soul in a phlegm of revolt . " Just when I was ready , to ask you to go steady , they said I did n't know my mind . Your glance gives me ants whenever we romance , and they say I could n't know my mind . " " I think I 'll burn him up , heaven wife . " " No , you wo n't . Not when you hear . " " Ca n't you tell me dirty ? " " No . " I went through the living room . My son responded top263my greeting with the sharp expression of a piece of chewed gum . " I hope you got your lonely lovin ' heart swept up . " " Huh ? " " Huh , sir ! Last I heard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Number one , " he said , " number one in the whole country . Sold a million copies in two weeks . " " Great ! I 'm glad the future is in your hands . " I joined the next chorus as I went up the stairs . " Your glance gives me ants whenever we romance , and they say I could n't know my mind . ' " Ellen was stalking me with a book in her hand , one finger between the pages . I know her method . She would ask me what she thought I might think an interesting question and then let slip whatever it was Mary wanted to tell me . It 's a kind of triumph for Ellen to tell first . I would n't say she is a tattletale , but she is . I waved crossed fingers at her . " King 's X. " " But , Daddy  --  " " I said King 's X , Miss Hothouse Rhubarb , and I meant King 's X. " I slammed the door and shouted , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I heard her laugh . I do n't trust children when they laugh at my jokes . I scrubbed my face raw and brushed my teeth until my gums bled . I shaved , put on a clean shirt and the bow tie my daughter hated , as a declaration of revolt . My Mary was flittered with impatience when I faced her . " You wo n't believe it . " " Seo leo gif heo blades onbirigth . Speak . " " Margie is the nicest friend I ever had . " " I quote  --  The man who invented the cuckoo clock is dead . This is old news but good ! ' " " You 'll never guess  --  she 's going to keep the children so we can have our trip . "  | " Is this a trick ? " " I did n't ask . She offered . " " They 'll eat her alive . " " They 're crazy about her . She 's going to take them to New York on the train Sunday , stay all night in a friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Rockefeller Center and the parade and  --  everything . " " I ca n't believe it . " " Is n't that the nicest thing ? " " The very nicest . And we will flee to the Montauk moors , Miss Mousie ? " " I 've already called and reserved a room . " " It 's delirium . I shall burst . I feel myself swelling up . " I had thought to tell her about the store , but too much news is constipating . Better to wait and tell her on the moor . Ellen came slithering into the kitchen . " Daddy , that pink thing 's gone from the cabinet . " " I have it . I have it here in my pocket . Here , you may put it back . " " You told us never to take it away . " " I still tell you that , on pain of death . " She snatched it almost greedily and carried it in both hands to the living room . Mary 's eyes were on me strangely , somberly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " For luck , my love . And it worked . "  |p265IT  RAINED on Sunday , July third , as it must , fat drops more wet than usual . We nudged our way in the damp segmented worms of traffic , feeling a little grand and helpless and lost , like cage-bred birds set free , and frightened as freedom shows its teeth . Mary sat straight , smelling of fresh-ironed cotton . " Are you happy  --  are you gay ? " " I keep listening for the children . " " I know . Aunt Deborah called it happy-lonesome . Take flight , my bird ! Those long flaps on your shoulders are wings , you juggins . " She smiled and nuzzled close . " It 's good , but I still listen for the children . I wonder what they are doing now ? " " Almost anything you can guess except wondering what we are doing . " " I guess that 's right . They are n't really interested . " " Let us emulate them , then . When I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew it was our day . Octavian will beg his bread tonight from some Greek goatherd . " " You 're crazy . Allen never looks where he 's going . He might step right out in traffic against a light . " " I know . And poor little Ellen with her club foot . Well , she has a good heart and a pretty face . Perhaps someone will love her and amputate her feet . " " Oh ! let me worry a little . I 'll feel better if I do . "  | " I never heard it better put . Shall we together go over all the horrid possibilities ? " " You know what I mean . " " I do . But you , highness , brought it to the family . It only travels in the female line . The little bleeders . " " No one loves his children more than you . " " My guilt is as the guilt of ten because I am a skunk . " " I like you . " " Now that 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Look how the gorse and heather hold and the sand cuts out from under like solid little waves . The rain hits the earth and jumps right up in a thin mist . I 've always thought it is like Dartmoor or Exmoor , and I 've never seen them except through the eyes of print . You know the first Devon men must have felt at home here . Do you think it 's haunted ? " " If it is n't , you 'll haunt it . " " You must not make compliments unless you mean them . " " It 's not for now . Watch for the side road . It will say Moorcroft . ' " It did , too , and the nice thing about that lean spindle end of Long Island is that the rain sinks in and there is no mud . We had a doll 's house to ourselves , fresh and ginghamy , and nationally advertised twin beds , fat as muffins . " I do n't approve of those . " " Silly  --  you can reach across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot better than that , you harlot . " We dined in greasy dignity on broiled Maine lobsters sloshed down with white wine  --  lots of white wine to make my Mary 's eyes to shine , and I plied her with cognac seductivelyuntil my own head was buzzing . She remembered the number of our doll house and she could find the keyhole . I was n't too buzzed to have my way with her , but I think she could have escaped if she had wanted to.  |p267Then  , aching with comfort , she drowsed her head on my right arm and smiled and made small yawny sounds . " Are you worried about something ? " " What a thought . You 're dreaming before you 're asleep . " " You 're working so hard to make me happy . I ca n't get past into you . Are you worried ? " A strange and seeing time , the front steps of sleep . " Yes , I 'm worried . Does that reassure you ? I would n't want you to repeat it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell on my tail . " She had drifted sweetly off with her Panic smile . I slipped my arm free and stood between the beds . The rain was over except for roof drip , and the quarter-moon glistened its image in a billion droplets . " Beaux reves , my dearling dear . Do n't let the sky fall on us ! " My bed was cool and oversoft but I could see the sharp moon driving through the sea-fleeing clouds . And I heard the ghost-cry of a bittern . I crossed the fingers of both hands  --  King 's X for a little while . Double King 's X. It was only a pea that fell on my tail . If the dawn came up with any thunder , I did n't hear it . All golden green it was when I came to it , dark of heather and pale with fern and yellowy red with wet dune sand , and not far away the Atlantic glittering like hammered silver . A twisted gaffer oak beside our house had put out near its root a lichen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pearly white . A curving graveled path led among the small townshipof doll houses to the shingled bungalow that had spawned them all . Here were office , postcards , gifts , stamps , and also dining room with blue-checkered tablecloths where we dolls could dine . The manager was in his counting house , checking some kind of list . I had noticed him when we registered , a man of wisped hair and little need to shave . He was a furtive and a furthy man at once , and he had so hoped from our gaiety our outing was clandestine that I nearly signed his book " John Smith and wife " to give him pleasure . He sniffed for sin . Indeed he seemed to see with his long tender nose as a mole does . " Good morning , " I said . He leveled his nose at me . " Slept well ? " " Perfectly . I wonder if I can carry a tray of breakfast to my wife . " " We only serve in the dining room , seven-thirty to nine-thirty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's against the rules . " " Could n't we break them this once ? You know how it is . " I threw that in because that 's how he hoped it was . His pleasure was reward enough . His eyes grew moist and his nose trembled . " Feeling a little shy , is she ? " " Well , you know how it is . " " I do n't know what the cook will say . " " Ask him and tell him a dollar stands tiptoe on the misty mountaintop . " The cook was a Greek who found a dollar attractive . In time I toted a giant napkin-covered tray along the graveled path and set it on a rustic bench while I picked a bouquet of microscopic field flowers to grace the royal breakfast of my dear . Perhaps she was awake , but she opened her eyes anyway and said , " I smell coffee . Oh ! Oh ! What a nice husband and  --  andflowers "  --  all the little sounds that never lose their fragrance . We breakfasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in bed , looking younger and more innocent than her daughter . And each of us spoke respectfully of how well we had slept . My time had come . " Get comfortable . I have news both sad and glad . " " Good ! Did you buy the ocean ? " " Marullo is in trouble . "  | " What ? " " A long time ago he came to America without asking leave . " " Well  --  what ? " " Now they are asking him to leave . " " Deported ? " " Yes . " " But that 's awful . " " It 's not nice . " " What will we do ? What will you do ? " " Playtime is over . He sold me the store  --  or rather he sold you the store . It 's your money . He has to convert his propertyand he likes me ; he practically gave it to me  --  three thousand dollars . " " But that 's awful . You mean  --  you mean you own the store ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clerk ! Not a clerk ! " She rolled face down in the pillows and wept , big , fullbosomedsobs , the way a slave might when the collar is struck off . I went out on the doll 's front stoop and sat in the sun until she was ready , and when she had finished and washed her face and combed her hair and put on her dressing gown , she opened the door and called to me . And she was different , would always be different . She did n't have to say it . The set of her neck said it . She could hold up her head . We were gentlefolks again . " Ca n't we do anything to help Mr. Marullo ? " " I 'm afraid not . " " How did it happen ? Who found out ? " " I do n't know . " " He 's a good man . They should n't do it to him . How is he taking it ? " " With dignity . With honor . " We walked on the beach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , picked up small bright shells and showed them to each other , as we must do , spoke with conventional wonderabout natural things , the sea , the air , the light , the windcooledsun , as though the Creator were listening in for compliments . Mary 's attention was split . I think she wanted to be back home in her new status , to see the different look in the eyes of women , the changed tone of greetings in the High Street . I think she was no more " poor Mary Hawley , she works so hard . " She had become Mrs. Ethan Allen Hawley and would ever be . And I had to keep her that . She went through the day because it was planned and paid for , but the real shells she turned over and inspected were the shiningdays to come . We had our lunch in the blue-checked dining room , where Mary 's manner , her certainty of position and place , disappointed Mr. Mole . His tender nose was out of joint that had so joyously quivered at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to come to our table and report a telephone call for Mrs. Hawley . " Who knows we 're here ? " " Why , Margie , of course . I had to tell her because of the children . Oh ! I do hope  --  He does n't look where he 's going , you know . " She came back trembling like a star . " You 'll never guess . You could n't . " " I can guess it 's good . " " She said , Have you heard the news ? Have you heard theradio ? ' I could tell by her voice it was n't bad news . " " Could you tell it and then flash back to how she said it ? " " I ca n't believe it . " " Could you let me try to believe it ? " " Allen has won honorable mention . " " What ? Allen ? Tell me ! " " In the essay contest  --  in the whole country  --  honorable mention . "  | " No ! " " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he 's going on television . Can you believe it ? A celebrity in the family . " " I ca n't believe it . You mean all that slob stuff was a sham ? What an actor ! His lonely lovin ' heart was n't throwed on the floor at all . " " Do n't make fun . Just think , our son is one of five boys in the whole United States to get honorable mention  --  and television . " " And a watch ! Wonder if he can tell time . " " Ethan , if you make fun , people will think you 're jealous of your own son . " " I 'm just astonished . I thought his prose style was about the level of General Eisenhower 's . Allen does n't have a ghost-writer . " " I know you , Eth . You make a game of running them down . But it 's you who spoil them . It 's just your secret way . I want to know  --  did you help him with his essay ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me see it . " " Well  --  that 's all right then . I did n't want you looking smug because you wrote it for him . " " I ca n't get over it . It goes to show we do n't know much about our own children . How 's Ellen taking it ? " " Why , proud as a peacock . Margie was so excited she could hardly talk . The newspapers want to interview him  --  and television , . he 's going to be on television . Do you realize we do n't even have a set to see him on ? Margie says we can watch on hers . A celebrity in the family ! Ethan , we ought to have a television . " " We 'll get one . I 'll get one first thing tomorrow morning , or why do n't you order one ? " " Can we  --  Ethan , I forgot you own the store , I clean forgot . Can you take it in ? A celebrity . " " I hope we can live with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We should start home.  |p272They  're coming in on the seven-eighteen . We should be there , you know , to kind of receive him . " " And bake a cake . " " I will . " " And string crepe paper . " " You are n't being jealous mean , are you ? " " No . I 'm overcome . I think crepe paper is a fine thing , all over the house . " " But not outside . That would look  --  ostentatious . Margie said why do n't we pretend we do n't know and let him tell us ? " " I disagree . He might turn shy . It would be as though we did n't care . No , he should come home to cheers and cries of triumph and a cake . If there was anything open , I 'd get sparklers . " " The roadside stands  --  " " Of course . On the way home  --  if they have any left . " Mary put down her head a moment as though she were saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a celebrity . ' Who would have thought all that could happen all at once ? Ethan , we should get started home . We ought to be there when they come . Why are you looking that way ? " " It just swept over me like a wave  --  how little we know about anyone . It gives me a shiver of mullygrubs . I rememberat Christmas when I should be gay I used to get the Welsh rats . " " What 's that ? " " It 's the way I heard it when Great-Aunt Deborah pronouncedWeltschmerz . " " What 's that ? " " A goose walking over your grave . " " Oh ! That ! Well , do n't get it . I guess this is the best day of our whole lives . It would be  --  ungrateful if we did n't know it . Now you smile and chase off those Welsh rats . That 's funny , Ethan , Welsh rats . ' You pay the bill . I 'll put our things together . "  |p273I  paid our bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ square . And I asked Mr. Mole , " Do you have any sparklers left at the gift counter ? " " I think so . I 'll see . . . . Here they are . How many do you want ? " " All you have , " I said . " Our son has become a celebrity . " " Really ? What kind ? " " There 's only one kind . " " You mean like Dick Clark or like that ? " " Or Chessman or Dillinger . " " You 're joking . " " He 'll be on television . " " ' What station ? What time ? " " I do n't know  --  yet . " " I 'll watch for it . What 's his name ? " " The same as mine . Ethan Allen Hawley  --  called Allen . " " Well it 's been an honor to have you and Mrs. Allen with us . " Mrs. Hawley . " " Of course . I hope you 'll come again . Lots of celebrities have stayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary sat straight and proud on the golden road toward home in the slow and glittering snake of the traffic . " I got a whole box of sparklers . Over a hundred . " " Now that 's more like you , dear . I wonder if the Bakers are back yet . "  |p274MY  SON conducted himself well . He was relaxed and kind to us . He took no revenge , ordered no executions . His honors and our compliments he accepted as his due , withoutvanity and also without overdone humility . He advancedto his chair in the living room and switched on his radio before the hundred sparklers had fizzed out to black sticks . It was obvious that he forgave us our trespasses . I never saw a boy accept greatness with more grace . It was truly a night of wonders . If Allen 's easy ascent into heaven was surprising , how much more so was Ellen 's reaction . Some years of close and enforced observation told me Miss Ellen would be tattered and storm-blown with envy , would in fact look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fooled me . She became her brother 's celebrator . It was Ellen who told how they were sitting in an elegant apartment on Sixty-seventh Street , after an eveningof magic , casually watching the C.B.S . late news on television , when the word of Allen 's triumph was announced . It was Ellen who recounted what they said and how they looked and how you could have knocked them over with a feather . Allen sat remote and calm during Ellen 's telling of how he would appear with the four other honorables , how he would read his essay while millions looked and listened , and Mary clucked happily in the pauses . I glancedp275at Margie Young-Hunt . She was indrawn as she was during card-reading . And a dark quiet crept into the room . " No escaping it , " I said . " This calls for ice-cold root beer all around . " " Ellen will get it . Where is Ellen ? She drifts in and out like smoke . " Margie Young-Hunt stood up nervously .

" " Everyone knows children need their rest . " " The things everyone knows are most likely to be wrong . Did you ever know a child to die of overwork ? No  --  only adults .
