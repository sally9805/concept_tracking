Shirley Jones 's hair formed a shiny golden knot on the top of her head . All of her seemed shiny and golden  --  above all , her translucent skin . It glowed as if lights had been switched on just under the surface . She sat on a love seat with her legs crossed under her , wearing a pale pastel cashmere sweater and pastel Capri pants made of stretch nylon . Her simple , expensive clothes did little to conceal the fact that her body is solid , but luxuriously constructed , with the curves in the right places . Her eyes slant up at the corners the way Sophia Loren 's do . Here was a well-bred , courteous young lady , smiling brightly and holding herself ready to answer my questions . Her manner was that of a polite ingenue , Yet , not long before , I had seen her portray a convincing prostitute as Lulu Baines in the film Elmer Gantry . In a year when most of the outstanding female cinema roles were what the Hollywood trade prettily calls " prosties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most effective trollops of them all . However , her conversation was not sophisticated , not womanof-the-world ; it did not suggest a hard , tough mind . Even such a simple fact as her name , Shirley May Jones , was confusing . It was so very much the name that a prim , small girl would answer to in a churchgoing , bedrock American small town that it did n't seem real . Rather , it had the flavor of a name thought up by a Hollywood casting director , to blend with her gingham-dress roles , such as the sweet young girl , Laurcy , in Oklahoma ! and the ingenue in Carousel . It was a matter for wonderment to me why a girl so capable of playing the sexpot in Elmer Gantry had n't somehow been given a name that went with black-lace lingerie and potent " getyour-man " perfume . Actually she was christened Shirley May Jones in the small , churchgoing , bedrock American community where she was born twenty-seven years ago . Her mother , hoping for a perfect little lady , named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " When I saw you in Gantry , " I said , " I asked myself , Now does this girl know enough about prostitutes to be so believable ? I was so curious I asked Richard Brooks ( who wrote the script and directed Gantry ) . He told me , ' She works hard . ' But that 's no answer . A lot of people work hard . " " Dick was a great help to me in understanding Lulu Baines , " she said . " But I welcomed that role , because for years I had been typecast as a small-town girl with a plain-Jane name . I 'd had it with the too , too sweet Hollywood singing heroines of Oklahoma and Carousel . Those films were wonderful for me , but at the same time they put me into a hard-to-escape-from category . " I know you 're thinking that after Gantry I woke up every morning and found offers left at my door to play shady ladies . Hollywood is supposed to suffer from a sheep psychology . If you play a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered after that are doctor and lawyer roles . That did n't happen to me . After Gantry , I played opposite Cantinfias in Pepe . After Pepe , J played a Western tomboy , with Jimmy Stewart and Richard Widmark , in Two Rode Together . I was a good rider and a fast gun . I drove a wagon train , I wore blue jeans ; and had braids . The role I now have is quite a change . As you know , I 'm playing the part of Marian , the straitlaced lady librarian in The Music Man . " I asked her if she thought that her casting as the librarian in The Musk ' Man was a return to the gingham-gowned , apple-cheeked roles she had played in Oklahoma ! and Carousel . She said , " The lady librarian is more woman than girl . She 's older , although she 's still frustrated as a female . She 's a spinster who lives in a small town . She thinks that because she 's the librarian and has read many books , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . But she is bewitched by the hero and finds herself falling in love with him , although he certainly is n't the kind of man she has selected to spend her life with . " Shirley believes that the role is actually rich , rewarding and varied . She starts out overly prim and proper , with a tight , no-nonsense hairdo , strictly-for-business glasses , and dry-as-dust work in the library . From that desiccated female she blooms , as Katharine Hepburn bloomed in The African Queen : right in front of your eyes she became a woman . " To watch that grim-looking girl change into a woman as she went down the river , " Shirley told me  --  speaking of Hepburn ? " was simply amazing . She should have got an Oscar for that . " She remarked that a lot of her friends did n't want her to win an Oscar , because some girls who won Oscars have never been heard from again . " I do n't buy that , " she said . " Maybe I 'm so young and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that anything irretrievably bad will ever happen to my career . In some cases , if they win an Oscar , actresses have demanded too much in the way of stories from producers , and too much money . Performance is the important thing  --  that and to keep working , no matter how many Oscars you win . " To get an intimate view of Shirley , once-removed , I remembered something  --  if you 're married , one person knows you better than you know yourself  --  so I decided to talk with Shirley 's husband . Jack Cassidy . " Maybe you can explain it , " I said to Cassidy . We were sitting in the patio behind his California home , before he left to tour the summer music-tent circuit . " I saw your wife as a woman of ill repute in Elmer Gantry . Now I 've seen her as herself , and the two are completely different . Underneath all her wholesomeness , there 's got to be something that 1 do n't see . " " You 're making the same mistake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Since she is genuinely nice , you feel that she 's completely innocuous . If Shirley did n't have many sides and many colors , her niceness would have no validity . Lulu Baines , the character she played in Elmer Gantry , did n't start as a bad girl . Lulu was once a good girl , but she was led astray . That 's one of the reasons Shirley 's performance was so believable . The fact that she knew what it meant to be a good girl also meant that when something was subtracted from that goodness , she knew it . " Then I dug deeper . " Speaking of Shirley in that prostitute role , " I said , " how did she ever get it ? Certainly not on her past-performance record in sweet-and-innocent parts . " Cassidy looked at me in surprise . " I thought you knew , " he said . " She played an alcoholic opposite Red Skelton in a Playhouse 90 TV show . She did n't have the experience and maturity for such a role , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it up like a sponge . She 's not ashamed of doing anything any director asks . That 's what a good director looks for  --  not a puppet , but someone willing to give all . " I said to Cassidy . " To backtrack even further , how did your wife happen to be cast as an alcoholic on the Skelton show ? " " She owes it to Milo Franks , " Cassidy said . " He was in charge of casting Playhouse 90 , although Ralph Nelson , who directed it , also had to O.K. her . She had sung a song , I Hate Men , from Kiss Me , Kate , on a TV show . From that one song , by some strange reasoning process , the knowing people in show business realized she could play stronger , guttier , more womanly roles . " As for that song on TV , Burt Lancaster and Bernie Smith , who afterward produced Elmer Gantry , heard and saw her sing it . They wanted Shirley right then , for a picture called The Devil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was pregnant with our first son . " Cassidy paused . " I have a theory that one of the reasons why Shirley is happily normal , " he went on , " is that she 's a mother , so she 's been fulfilled as both a woman and a wife . As a result she does n't have the consuming , overpowering creative urge which drives some actresses . One of the reasons I was attracted to her when I played opposite her in Oklahoma ! was that I do n't like aggressive girls . Career women repel me . Something is lacking in their lives . That 's why they 're aggressive . " Cassidy studied me for a moment , then said , " Shirley might have been a little preoccupied and tense when you talked with her . She was tense because she was about to hear from her doctor whether we were going to have another child . Since then he 's completed his tests . We are . It may arrive before your readers see this . " I told him , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your career than she does her ? own . She did n't tell me . I just sensed it . " " That 's true , " Cassidy said . " It 's been true from the moment we fell in love . That 's one reason why 1 was attracted to her . I think she should feel that way . Not that I 'm not interested in her career too . I am , but to reverse it too much would detract from the role the man of the family ought to play . I 'm not a husband who 's about to sit on his duff and tell his wife , Do n't worry , baby , we 'll make you a big star , ' while I walk her dogs for her . That kind of deal is not for me . " Perhaps my next question was expected , for Cassidy went on , " I know what you thought when you looked at Shirley the first time : Anybody that sweet and friendly and happy has got to be dull . " I tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said , " Do n't tell me you did n't . I anticipated the Dullsville bit in her too . I had even created an expression for it : ' Every time she speaks , bluebirds fly out of her mouth . ' But I never needed it . " Those who have known Shirley Jones from birth can understand that . She was born in 1934 ? not at " Dullsville , " but at Charleroi , south of Pittsburgh . When she was two , her parents moved to nearby Smithton , where her father , grandmother and four uncles owned the local brewery . At twelve she began taking voice from a Pittsburgh teacher . The summer after she was graduated from high school something happened which changed her life . Without asking Shirley , her Pittsburgh voice teacher entered her in the 1952 Miss Pittsburgh beauty and talent contest . Shirley won . She received a Pittsburgh Playhouse scholarship and a voice scholarship and found herself making personal appearances instead of going to college . She never did get to college . The following summer she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coach who had written a musical for the Pittsburgh Playhouse , and for his friend , Gus Schirmer , an agent . Welch said , " Your voice is richer . " Schirmer promised , " I can get work for you . " Shirley replied , " I 'm not ready for New York , " and went home . But Schirmer kept telephoning her family . " Your daughter is making a big mistake ; she must come back . " So Shirley 's parents trotted her back to New York . At the time she had $250 from birthday and Christmas checks and small sums earned singing . She decided that if the $250 ran out before she got a job , she 'd skip show business . Luck ran her way within a week . At that time Rodgers and Hammerstein had several musicals running on Broadway and needed constant replacements . To get them , they held weekly auditions  --  open to all corners . Schirmer sent her to one . She got up and sang The Best Things in Life Are Free and Lover . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ director , asked , " Where are you from , and what have you done ? " Shirley replied , " I have n't done anything , and I 've been in New 1 . York only a week . " Fearnley 's response was to cancel the other auditions and rush Shirley across the street to the St. James Theater , where Rodgers was rehearsing the orchestra for the national company of Oklahoma ! Rodgers summoned Hammerstein , who immediately asked , " Do you know the score of Oklahoma ! ? " Shirley climbed to the stage under orders from Hammerstein to " get up there and sing some numbers with the full orchestra . " So she sang People Will Say We 're in Love and Oh , What a Beautiful Mornin ' , although she 'd never sung them before . Rodgers announced , " We have something in mind for you . In the meantime we 'll put you in. the chorus of South Pacific and give you a couple ' of lines to say . " He then called her agent and said he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hornblow Jr. , and director Fred Zinnemann , who were then in New York planning the film version of Oklahoma ! Shirley did . Hornblow asked , " Have you ever had a screen test ? " Shirley said no . He said , " Thank you . " Rodgers broke the news later to her agent : " Shirley did a lovely job , but we 're afraid she 's too inexperienced to handle this role . " Shirley , undaunted , went back to South Pacific . When it closed , six months later , Rodgers and Hammerstein put her in the Chicago road-show cast of Me and Juliet , as Juliet . Four months later they rushed her back from Chicago to New York . Hornblow and Zinnemann were there again , with R. and H. Again Shirley sang and read  --  with a difference . " My experience in Me and Juliet and in South Pacific must have done me good , " she says , " because they sent me to California to test for the leading female role in the film . " After several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to do the picture , " he an nounced . She says , " I almost dropped dead . ' The film shooting in Hollywood lasted nine months . Then she returned to New York . One day Rodgers called and asked , " How 'd you like to go to l'urope ? " A company of Oklahoma ! was going to play three weeks in Paris and three in Rome . Shirley agreed . The company rehearsed for a month in New York at the Broadway Theater  --  and it was then and there that Shirley met her future husband , Jack Cassidy . He was playing the role of Curly , " I sensed his attraction immediately . Bat he was married , although separated from his wife , so I tried to keep away from him because falling in love with a married man is bad . Then , the first Sunday night we were in Paris he asked me to go out with him , and I went . I knew I was in love with him . We had three wonderful weeks in Paris and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those two cities was something I 'll never forget . " Back in the United States , Jack visited Shirley on location in California during the filming of Carousel , in which she played the ingenue , and meanwhile got a divorce . Their wedding followed . It was a proper marriage . She wore a white dress . A friend from Smithton served as her matron of honor . She and Jack had a one-night honeymoon in Boston . The next day she had to go to Dallas , to be in Showboat . When they were back in New York , Cassidy went into a show , and they began to furnish their apartment . Jack and Shirley lived together in New York almost a year . During that year they made eight or ten trips to Hollywood to do TV shows . Next came a film job for Shirley , April Love , for 20th Century-Fox , with Pat Boone . That was the film in which Pat made headlines all over the country by refusing to kiss the girl in the picture  --  Shirley . He said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like it . " We settled for almost kissing , " Shirley told me . " We 'd get very close to each other , then somebody would say , ' Hey ! ' and we 'd both turn to answer . That way we never quite made it . " That brought up something I 've never discussed with an actress : what she thinks about while a stage kiss is going on ? Does she pretend she 's being embraced by somebody she likes ? " I just do n't even think about it , " Shirley explained . " It 's purely mechanical . You 're not thinking about kissing any particular person . It 's just a piece of stage business  --  like lighting a cigarette , or picking up a drink . Most actors will tell you it 's that way , unless , of course , you 're infatuated with the person you 're kissing . When I worked with Jack in Oklahoma ! , after each kiss I had trouble remembering my lines . " She had a date with her hairdresser , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was getting my interview with Shirley down on paper , I remembered one other thing that Jack Cassidy had said . I had asked him , " How does your wife feel now that she 's won an Oscar , and how do you think she would have felt if she 'd lost ? " " When she won , she was on Cloud Ten , " Cassidy replied . " If she had n't won , she 'd have been disappointed , just as anybody would who 's trying to be a champion . But losing would n't really have upset her . She would have kept right on working in The Music Man , just as she has done , and she would have been offered other good parts . After all , the girl has talent , she is beautiful , and she can sing like an angel . Those three things are a pretty good parlay. "
