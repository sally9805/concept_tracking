Mrs. Rosemary 's sitting-room . It is decorated in lavender , pink and white : there are large pink roses on the wall-paper and , on a little table in the right-hand corner ( from the actor 's point of view ) , with pink bows tied around their necks , roses of impossible size in a vase . A pink sofa on the left ; a door leading to the street at the left of the back wall and another door on the right , leading into the house ; a window , with lavender curtains , in the back at the right . A desk , with a calendar and a clock , against the left wall behind the couch . There is a waste-basket with a pink bow beside it . Mrs. Rosemary , dressed in lavender in a style suggesting the end of the last century  --  high collar with pink bow , corseted waist and long full skirts  --  comes in through the door on the right , crosses over to the opposite side of the room and tears the number 31 off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and drops it into the waste-paper basket ; then briskly glances at the clock . Though costumed like a kind of bonbon , she is decisive and very firm . MRS . ROSEMARY It 's nearly half past nine : I must get him off .  --  Osbert ! OSBERT ( appearing from the right-hand door ) . Yes , Mother dear . He is dressed in a deeper shade of purple , with belling sailor 's trousers and an enormous Eton collar with a silk bow-tie of deep rose-color . His hair is parted in the middle . p. 3 MRS . ROSEMARY It 's almost time for you to go : are you ready ? This is the day for you to leave , you know . OSBERT I 'm not quite packed yet , Mother dear . MRS . ROSEMARY Good heavens ! What have you been doing ? OSBERT It was so lovely I went for a walk . MRS . ROSEMARY My dear , when you begin to work , you 'll have to learn to be more punctual . I really do n't know how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think of anything better for you to do . You 're not active enough for the Army and you have n't enough money for politics . You 're not interested in Medicine or Law . And the Church has gone completely bankrupt . OSBERT Yes , Mother dear : I know . MRS . ROSEMARY The only thing you can do is write poetry , and poetry is not a profession . But your work in the paperweight factory wo n't prevent you from writing , too . They 're very old friends of ours and belong to the old pre-industrial world of distinguished handicraft . OSBERT Yes , Mother : I 've come to believe that the only hope for modern civilization is simply in making beautiful things . I feel that a real poet designing really beautiful paperweights might help to transform the world . p. 4 MRS . ROSEMARY Well , my dear , you must be content at first to learn your trade very patiently and humbly . ( She sits down on the sofa , and Osbert sits down beside her . ) Though you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Megrims ' business is n't like a modern factory . The Megrims are n't really business people at all  --  they were formerly attached to the Court . OSBERT Yes , of course , Mother dear : I know . MRS . ROSEMARY With the exception of ourselves , in fact , the Megrims are almost the only family left who still lives in their original stone house . They and we and a very few others . That is a very great distinction and one that you should be very proud of . When you get to Mr. Rudolf 's Town tomorrow , you will find all the houses made of glass  --  and the people who live in glass houses are n't the same as the old race . OSBERT Yes , Mother dear  --  of course . I know what it means to be a stone-house man . MRS . ROSEMARY But you have never seen the glass-house civilization . In the places where everything is made of glass , the roofs of people 's houses are always cracking and their floors breaking up under their feet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never accomplish anything really sound . Why , if they even try to stain their own glass , their houses are taken away by Mr. Rudolf and melted up in the common foundry ! p. 5 OSBERT Yes , Mother : I think it 's disgusting . MRS . ROSEMARY So you must remember always , my dear , no matter how far away from home you may be , that your standards are stone-house standards  --  that you do not belong to the world of glass . You must remember that there are certain things which a stone-house man is obliged to do , no matter whether the glass-house people do them or not , and that there are things which you must n't do , even though everybody else does them . The principles of the glass-house people are always being shattered to bits or being melted down to cheap easy materials . But the honor of a stone-house man must stand fast and endure like stone ! OSBERT You know that Dominic the Dolmen has always been my favorite hero , Mother dear ! VOICES OUTSIDE THE WINDOW @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up ) . There are Queenie and Lucille come to say goodby . Queenie and Lucille come in from the street : they are pretty little girls with hair-ribbons . Queenie , the younger , in pale pink , is a blonde ; Lucille , in red , a brunette . QUEENIE We 've brought you some goodby presents , Berty ! MRS . ROSEMARY Oh , how nice ! p. 6 OSBERT You ought n't to have done that ! QUEENIE Why , we would n't let you go without a present to remember us by ! It 's going to be months before we see you again !  --  This is a pincushion , Berty  --  I thought you 'd probably need one . ( She presents him with a round pink pincushion . ) OSBERT Oh , what a lovely color ! What a lovely shape ! How sweet of you to think of it , Queenie ! I 'll never stick a pin in my pin-cushion without remembering you ! LUCILLE ( producing a large pocket-knife ) . I thought you might need a knife : I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank you  --  thank you , Lucille ! I 've never been able to keep a knife  --  I 've always lost them right away . But I 'll keep this one forever ! It 's the most beautiful knife I 've ever seen ! With three blades !  --  and what 's this ? LUCILLE That 's a thing to punch holes with . MRS . ROSEMARY An awl . OSBERT And what 's this ? A corkscrew ! How marvelous ! MRS . ROSEMARY ( smiling ) . I hope you wo n't need that too often . QUEENIE Oh , Berty ! what shall we ever do without you ? You must write to us often and often ! p. 7 OSBERT I will : and you must write me , too  --  you and Lucille both . QUEENIE Oh , we will ! we will ! MRS . ROSEMARY I must go up and get his shawlstrap packed : the carriage will be here in a minute . QUEENIE Oh , do let me help , Mrs. Rosemary ! I love to pack people 's things ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't wander away while I 'm gone : you 've got to make connections with the coach . OSBERT All right , Mother dear : I wo n't . Mrs. Rosemary and Queenie go out through the door on the right . As soon as they have gone , Osbert swiftly comes over to Lucille and takes her by the hands . OSBERT I could n't pack last night : I was thinking all the time of you ! When I came back , after we 'd been together , things like packing did n't seem real ! I did n't even take off my clothes ! I did n't even sleep ! I could n't do anything but make up poetry ! He makes her sit down on the sofa , still holding her hands . LUCILLE Foolish : you ought to have got some sleep . OSBERT Oh , Lucille  --  the only way I could tell what I feel would be to show you what I wrote , and though I think it 's the very best I ever did , it seems stupid to me when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , Lucille ! p. 8 LUCILLE You must n't miss the coach . OSBERT This is about when I was waiting in the garden  --  when I was afraid that you would n't come  --  when I was afraid that if you did come , I should n't dare to kiss you . I could n't believe then that I ever should ! LUCILLE I was scared you would n't , too . OSBERT This is what I wrote  --  Along the garden where you cameI envied wild inhuman things  --  The dahlias fierce , dilating flame , The spiders dizzy in their swings  --  LUCILLE ( laughing ) . The way Queenie gets , eh ? OSBERT But I really saw it all like that ! Gay tulips globing golden shouts  --  Snapdragons bridling , dazed , to bite  --  Brown columbine with quivering snouts , Like prowling boars surprised by light ! While I  --  I praying most for power , While stalks and stems were thrilled to life , Stand rooted , dumb and futile as a flowerBefore the drought , the tempest or the knife . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess you wo n't be that way long , after you 've been in Mr. Rudolf 's Town ! p. 9 OSBERT It was n't shyness : it was you ! When I see you , a shuddering shakes me ! LUCILLE Father scolded me because the hammock broke . OSBERT Oh , I 'm so sorry ! It was all my fault . LUCILLE I do n't care ! OSBERT And I do n't care about anything but you and that I 'm going away from you ! LUCILLE Oh , take me with you , Berty ! OSBERT I ca n't now .  --  But I 'll have you come on later . I thought about it all last night . LUCILLE You may forget about me in Mr. Rudolf 's Town , when you get to be a millionaire . OSBERT I sha n't be a millionaire . I do n't care anything about making money . That 's the trouble with Mr. Rudolf 's civilization  --  nobody cares about anything but money .  --  I want to create beautiful things that will make people forget about money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a millionaire , Lucille . If a man could bring back Beauty to Mr. Rudolf 's civilization , the people would fall down on their knees ! Compared to him , Mr. Rudolf would seem like an ugly toad . LUCILLE I hope that you 'll make enough money to send me my fare to the big Town . I 'm tired and sick of it here . Father wo n't let me have any fun . I want to get away to the Town . p. 10 OSBERT Oh , I shall , I hope  --  I shall ! Mrs. Rosemary and Queenie come back from upstairs : Mrs. Rosemary has Osbert 's shawl-strap , a purple and pink plaid , tied up with a large pink bow . QUEENIE I packed your things myself , Berty ! I put in some pressed rose-leaves ! OSBERT Oh , thank you so much , Mother dear . MRS . ROSEMARY ( who has just been to the window ) . The carriage is here : it 's time for you to go . OSBERT ( in a low voice to Lucille @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . And you 'll come on and we 'll be married ! MRS . ROSEMARY ( coming over and helping him on with his plum-colored cloak ) . Do n't forget to tip the driver , Osbert ; and put your muffler on during the night : you must n't catch cold in the coach . ( She hands him a sort of truncated high hat , also purple . ) OSBERT Yes , Mother dear . QUEENIE I think we ought to kiss him goodby , now that he 's going away for so long ! She kisses him and then Lucille kisses him : he kisses Lucille earnestly back . p. 11 LUCILLE ( sotto voce ) . See you soon in Mr. Rudolf 's Town , maybe ? OSBERT ( to Lucille ) . Yes : I 'll write  --  and you must write me often ! QUEENIE Oh , we will  --  we will . MRS . ROSEMARY Come , my dear : you must go ! She pilots him out the door . The girls stand looking after him . QUEENIE AND LUCILLE ( waving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ louder , turning toward the right , as the carriage drives off ) Goodby ! Goodby ! ( Sending their voices further ) Goodby ! LUCILLE ( turning back to the room ) . He 's turned the corner : he 's gone . QUEENIE ( still waving out the door ) . Goodbyee ! Goodbyee ! p. 12 Act 1 , Scene 2 SCENE 2 Old Mrs. Megrim 's drawing-room , all in antiquated browns and yellows . Two doors , at stage right and left , the former leading into the house and the latter to the street door . At the back , a fireplace with a mantel , and on the mantel , a most elaborate clock encrusted with a bristling bronze " allegory " of mythological figures with helmets and spears ; above the clock , a family portrait of some semi-royal personage in an elaborate military uniform and wig . On either side of the fireplace , in which a fire is burning , framed water-color designs for paperweights  --  they are all in the form of glass globes with little figures inside . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass cabinet for old china and precious old paperweights . Three old-fashioned chairs and a sofa , making a semicircle which faces the audience and of which the right-hand arm is the sofa . In the chair at the extreme left , old Mrs. Megrim is sitting : she is very shrunken and bent and dressed in dull brown : she wears a large lace-bordered bonnet with a visor which completely hides her face . Her son Harry , a blurred and gray-faced man of indeterminable age , with eye-glasses askew on his nose and a light brown suit which needs pressing , is introducing Osbert to his mother . They talk loudly to old Mrs. Megrim , because she is very deaf . OLD MRS . MEGRIM ( very senile , but with a certain social vigor ) . Well , Osbert Rosemary  --  a man ! When I last saw you , you were a tiny little boy . To think that Marguerite Rosemary should have a grown-up son ! I always remember your mother , Osbert , as she was when I first knew her . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year she came out , she was the belle of the season . I remember her so vividly at the antelope races ! They used to say that there were more people looking at Marguerite Rosemary than watching the antelopes ! And then her marriage was so romantic ! When she ran away with your father , she left all her suitors gasping : they had n't counted on being jilted for a man who came from the forests and whom nobody had ever known . He abandoned her as we feared he would , and she dropped her rather grotesque married name . I am told you more resemble your mother , but my poor old eyes are so weak that I am hardly aware nowadays of what my own son Harry looks like ! ( Harry Megrim laughs self-consciously and foolishly . ) I have to be content to know people through the eyes of the spirit merely  --  and that is perhaps as good a way as any with those who are near and dear to us . ( She very slowly and feebly opens a bag that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out a mothball , which she puts into her mouth . ) I wo n't offer you a mothball , Osbert : they are only for old folks like me : I know that a young fellow like you would scarcely consider them a delicacy ! p. 13 HARRY MEGRIM ( motioning Osbert toward the sofa ) . Do  --  please sit down , wo n't you ? ( He speaks stutteringly and blurtingly . ) OSBERT Thank you . He sits down , but the seat of the sofa collapses , subsiding to the level of the floor . HARRY MEGRIM Oh , I 'm afraid you 're not comfortable like that ! Our furniture is so inefficient  --  I mean to say old-ficient  --  I mean to say , old-fashioned ! OSBERT Oh , no ; I 'm quite comfortable , thank you . OLD MRS . MEGRIM ( who can not see what has happened ) . That sofa belonged to my great-uncle Jerolemon  --  your great-great uncle , Harry . HARRY MEGRIM Are you sure you 're quite comfortable there ? OSBERT Yes , thank you : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Trixie and Mr. Tiralira to come in this afternoon . We thought that it would be nice for you to meet them . They are new friends of ours , to be sure , but we have come to prize them highly . Mr. Trixie is such a gifted man  --  so sensitive and so fervent  --  and Mr. Tiralira is a connoisseur of such distinguished taste ! p. 14 HARRY MEGRIM And such a delightful fellow ! OLD MRS . MEGRIM And such a charming gentleman ! Mr. Trixie and Mr. Tiralira have been kind enough  --  I should even perhaps say , they have been heroic enough  --  to devote their energies and abilities  --  which , in these days of great industries and great fortunes , could be so much more profitably employed elsewhere  --  to what I may call the aesthetic department of our own humble little business  --  I hardly dare call it an industry ! We have felt that new blood was needed  --  I am sadly behind the times  --  but Harry follows the fads and the fashions , and the modern taste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Trixie and Mr. Tiralira have done us the honor of bringing to our problems their experience and mature wisdom , and now we shall have also to inspire us the creative spirit of youth . We expect from you , dear Osbert , new designs even more alluring and astonishing than any which have yet been evolved  --  with the paperweights , in short , of a poet ! I am sorry that I shall not be able to see them , but perhaps , after all , that is just as well , for I am sure that , much as I should admire them , I should not understand them at all ! ( She laughs and takes another mothball . ) HARRY MEGRIM ( indicating the drawings on either side of the fireplace ) . Those are both designs by Mr. Trixie . That  --  that one 's the Little Torpedo  --  and that  --  that 's the Iron Pansy  --  the Iron Pansy , you know is Mr. Rudolf 's symbol  --  and that  --  that one 's the Rudolf Monument . Quite up to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MEGRIM I shall never get used to it ! Our paperweights used all to be flowers or ferns or mythological figures ! Harry has opened the cabinet and taken out a large antique paperweight . He shows it to Osbert and then shakes it : the liquid inside the glass ball clouds up with little flakes . HARRY MEGRIM This is the " Eidelweiss in a Snowstorm . " OSBERT ( getting up to look at it ) . How lovely ! HARRY MEGRIM ( bringing out another ) . This  --  this is Dana and the Golden Shower . It 's really an awfully fine one . OLD MRS . MEGRIM Yes : the Dana ! Mr. Tiralira considers it the most perfect paperweight ever made . OSBERT Oh , what a beautiful one ! Let me see it !  --  How fresh and bright the gold still is ! HARRY MEGRIM ( as the doorbell rings ) . I think that must be them now . He goes out at the left . OLD MRS . MEGRIM I have always thought it would have been in better taste for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a monument in his honor . But he wanted to be sure it did him justice , I suppose ! Harry comes back with Mr. Trixie and Mr. Tiralira . Mr. Trixie wears an artist 's yellow tie , a Van Dyck beard , a green velvet jacket and yellow trousers . Mr. Tiralira , who is tall and slender , wears a light pea-green suit , with lavender spats and a pink handkerchief sticking out of his pocket . p. 16 MR . TIRALIRA ( effusively and gaily , advancing toward Mrs. Megrim ) . And how is the loveliest woman in the world ? The wittiest , the wisest , the most gracious ! The sovereign of all our hearts ! The eternal toast of the season ! ( He shakes hands with her so vigorously that her wrist breaks and her hand comes off in his . ) Oh , how dreadful ! I 'm so dreadfully sorry ! HARRY MEGRIM ( taking the hand from him ) . It really does n't matter . Mother 's getting so dilapidated  --  I mean to say , debilitated ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and replaces the paperweights . OLD MRS . MEGRIM It will be quite easy to have it mended . I fear that I 'm becoming a little brittle  --  like old porcelain , you know ! ( She laughs coquettishly . ) MR . TIRALIRA ( bowing ) . And even more precious ! OLD MRS . MEGRIM I should n't bring a very high price today , I 'm afraid : after all , I 'm not made of glass !  --  And now I must present Mr. Osbert Rosemary  --  the young man of whom I was telling you  --  the son of very dear old friends of ours . This is Mr. Trixie , Osbert  --  and Mr. Tiralira . ( The visitors and Osbert shake hands . ) You must forgive me  --  I am so blind that I ca n't see where you are ! p. 17 MR . TRIXIE What an enchanting old house , Mrs. Megrim ! What fascinating old things ! It always makes me want to weep to see them  --  to think that the art of making lovely things should almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The furniture in this room was given to my great-grandfather by Prince Louis . It was made for him by the royal cabinetmaker . MR . TRIXIE Ah , say what you like , Mrs. Megrim ! There can be no high beauty of living without high distinction of blood . In Prince Louis 's days , a lady 's drawing-room was as truly a work of art as a miniature or a fugue . Today the glass manufacturers and their government have vulgarized our whole civilization . Why , I would n't give a single chair in this room for the glass government and all its works ! ( Osbert has resumed his seat on the sunken sofa ; Mr. Tiralira is posted by the arm of Mrs. Megrim 's chair ; Harry has sat down in the chair nearest the sofa . Now Mr. Trixie seats himself between Harry and Mrs. Megrim , voluptuously stroking the arms of the chair . ) See : the lines of this lovely thing are like the strains of a violin ! As he settles himself , the back breaks and he falls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harry spring forward to help him up . OLD MRS . MEGRIM ( who is unaware of what has happened , taking a mothball with her remaining left hand ) . I wo n't offer you a mothball , Mr. Trixie : they are only for old people like me ! p. 18 HARRY MEGRIM Oh , dear ! I hope you did n't get broken ! I mean I hope you did n't get hurt ! MR . TRIXIE ( now on his feet and rubbing the back of his head ) . Oh , no ! I 'm not hurt ! Not at all ! But I 'm perfectly sick about the chair ! HARRY MEGRIM ( flustered and apprehensive ) . About the what ? Where is it you feel badly ? MR . TRIXIE I mean , I 'm broken-hearted about the chair ! MR . TIRALIRA What a pity that these exquisite old things should be subjected to every-day use ! They should really be preserved in a museum . I was speaking of it to Mr. Rudolf only the other day . Mr. Rudolf , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine taste . We are in the habit of judging him unfairly  --  of assuming that he is ignorant and vulgar . But though he rose from such humble beginnings , he has a strongly individual sense of beauty . He is a collector  --  in fact , the chief living authority on German imperial mustache cups and old American cigar-bands ; and he has what is probably the most complete collection in the world of stickpins made of stuffed goldfish . One might wish him to collect other things perhaps ! but it at least shows an original taste for the curious and the exotic . I was telling him only the other day about your beautiful house , and he said at once that he would like to preserve it  --  to have it set up just as it is in his museum . He asked whether you would care to sell it , and even named a very generous figure  --  if any price can be put upon the inestimable ! While he has been talking , Mr. Tiralira has been leaning on the end of the mantelpiece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angle , so that the clock has been sliding down in his direction . Harry Megrim has been watching it anxiously . p. 19 HARRY MEGRIM Look out for that allegory ! It 's a horrid thing to be spiked by ! MR . TIRALIRA ( taking his arm off , as Harry replaces the clock ) . Now in the museum they would have that fastened down ; they would make it impossible for such a thing to happen . Think if that wonderful old clock had fallen ! What an irreparable loss ! MR . TRIXIE Can you really believe that those vandals would know how to take care of these treasures ? MR . TIRALIRA I believe , as I have just been saying , that you quite misconceive Mr. Rudolf . In any case , he is sending an Emissary to discuss the matter with Mrs. Megrim . I hope you will receive him , dear lady . I think you will find that Mr. Rudolf is fully sensible of the consideration due you . Mr. Rudolf 's Emissary suddenly enters from the door on the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uniform , with a sharp nose and a small mustache . With a swift glance he picks out Mrs. Megrim and goes straight over to her . He does not remove his high black derby . THE EMISSARY Mrs. Westermountain Megrim ? OLD MRS . MEGRIM I am Mrs. Megrim . THE EMISSARY ( producing a paper ) . I have here an agreement for transference of property drawn up in the government offices and signed by Mr. Rudolf . According to this agreement , your house and the contents of the house are to be taken over by Mr. Rudolf 's government for the sum of thirty thousand zukors. p. 20 OLD MRS . MEGRIM Indeed ? That is very generous . But I am afraid it is out of the question . THE EMISSARY I must advise you that , should you fail to accept these terms , the house and its contents will be confiscated on an order of the Ministry of Monuments . OLD MRS . MEGRIM What is it he says , Harry ? MR . TIRALIRA ( intervening ) . Only think what it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! You would be free to travel and to live as you pleased ! You could go to the Spa every summer  --  you could resume your old social sovereignty ! HARRY MEGRIM It  --  it sounds like a square meal  --  I mean to say a square deal ! THE EMISSARY It has been brought to Mr. Rudolf 's attention that H. P. Megrim &amp; Son have been operating a small glass plant independent of the Government Glass Works . This plant has been used for the manufacture of paperweights of a kind not approved by the government and no longer in demand . I must advise you that all materials and tools employed in unauthorized glass-manufacture are to be surrendered to the Central Glass Works within ten days after the order has been issued . In compensation for these tools and materials , which are obsolete and of little value , you will receive an additional five thousand zukors. p. 21 MR . TIRALIRA ( to Harry ) . But consider , dear old boy ! Thirty-five thousand zukors ! Why , you could begin breeding owls again ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know that you would rather breed owls than do anything else in the world ! Do n't deny it , old boy ! It 's your vocation and your gift ! And Mr. Rudolf has told me confidentially that he will offer you a post in his aviary . OLD MRS . MEGRIM It is kind of Mr. Rudolf , Harry , to wish to make it possible for you to breed owls again ! MR . TRIXIE But what about us , Archy ? We ca n't work for the Central Glass Works ! MR . TIRALIRA But why ca n't we , my dear boy ? Mr. Rudolf will offer us places . He is most eager to have you take over the portfolio of Officers ' Uniforms . MR . TRIXIE Oh , dear : I 'm so easily influenced ! I 'm afraid I shall allow myself to be persuaded ! And what sort of a job will you get ? MR . TIRALIRA Mr. Rudolf has been flattering enough to offer me the curatorship of his museum . And you , my dear boy ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a poet . You will operate the electric ladders in Mr. Rudolf 's library . You will love it ! You will be mad about it ! Mr. Rudolf is a book collector , and his library contains nothing but first editions . You will get a thousand zukors a year . p. 22 OSBERT ( spiritedly and proudly ) . I will never work in Mr. Rudolf 's library ! I will never work for Mr. Rudolf at all ! My people are stone-house people , and my standards are stone-house standards ! What do I care about Mr. Rudolf 's money and his library and his museum ? The work I do , I do for its own sake  --  the things I make , I make for their own sake ! Not to live in a ridiculous palace and try to buy what I ca n't create . And the things that I make will be all new-born  --  not old first editions in a library . They will be forces that you can not control ! The Emissary blows a police whistle and two uniformed guards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Osbert with a single sharp gesture of the thumb ; and the guards snap handcuffs on him . THE EMISSARY You will proceed at once to the Desert , where you will be taught the duties of a sand shoveller . MR . TIRALIRA ( shaking one of Osbert 's manacled hands and clapping him on the shoulder ) . Go in and win , old boy ! It 's an arduous exacting life ; but there are big rewards for a lad of pluck ! OSBERT ( scornfully ) . Rewards ! What do I care for their silly rewards ? One of the guards claps a hand over his mouth and seizes him under the arms , and the other takes him by the feet : they swiftly carry him out . p. 23 OLD MRS . MEGRIM That was bravely spoken , Osbert ! How I wish I could see you standing there , in all the pride and candor of youth , defying the forces that bid fair to undo us ! We can not have you to work with us now  --  I am sorry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be wasting the years of your youngmanhood in our poky old-fashioned business . I am old and I must surrender . But you have youth and courage and strength . Go forth like a clear-eyed knight , Osbert ! Fight the fight of a stone-house man  --  and maintain stone house honor uncracked ! THE EMISSARY ( to Mr. Tiralira ) . Make them sign : I must go . ( He hands the agreement to Harry . ) HARRY MEGRIM ( looking at the paper bewilderedly ) . But I do n't understand it very well ! Suppose we should sign everything away and then find ourselves completely prostitute  --  I mean to say , destitute ! THE EMISSARY Where is the ink ? MR . TIRALIRA In the library .  --  ( To Harry ) Come along , old boy ! Mr. Tiralira and the Emissary , taking Harry by either arm  --  Mr. Tiralira on Harry 's right and the Emissary on the side toward the audience  --  steer him out through the door at the right . p. 24 THE EMISSARY ( to Mr. Tiralira ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me tonight . MR . TIRALIRA ( clapping the Emissary on the shoulder ) . Right you are ! Good-night , old boy ! He goes out with Harry . The Emissary , as they leave him at the door , finds that Harry Megrim 's arm has come off in his hand . He regards it without emotion . OLD MRS . MEGRIM Yet it was truly kind of Mr. Rudolf to wish me to go to the Spa ! MR . TRIXIE Yes : we should n't remember it against him that he was once only a button peddler . His energy and character are magnificent ! They have the beauty of some sinewy bronze ! The Emissary goes over to the fireplace and sticks Harry 's arm in the grate : he shoves it into the fire with his foot , then quickly goes out at the left. @x The Great Desert : a sand-sifting station . On the right is a high wall cutting across the back corner of the stage and showing dark against the blue western light of the late afternoon : a guard with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top from time to time . Below the wall is a sand-sifters ' one-room shack , one side of which is open to the audience and which occupies most of the stage . The shack is made of glass , but opaque : a doorway on the right , and small windows , two in the back and one in the right-hand wall between the back and the door . At the left , a plain deal table with a red cotton cloth , some cutlery and plates , cups , pitchers , etc. in thick white ware : two chairs are drawn up beside it . There is a clothes-line , with shirts and underclothes on it , stretched between the shack and the wall on the farther side of the door . Two army cots at the back . At the left of the shack , Osbert Rosemary and another older man are working mechanical sand-sifters . These are sieves which are shaken back and forth by turning a crank : they are fed from a large reservoir on the roof , from which the sand runs down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sieves are larger cylindrical jars , into which the sifted sand falls . The two men stand sifting in silence , Osbert facing the audience and his companion further forward and in profile . Both are dressed in blue sand-sifters ' overalls and coarse shirts open at the neck . The older man is bald and wears spectacles and a black skull-cap . Osbert at last speaks . OSBERT It must be nearly five . p. 26 DR . DISH I do n't think so : it was only half past three when I last looked . ( A silence ) The days are getting shorter : it gets dark earlier now . OSBERT Do we have tooth-mug inspection to-morrow ? DR . DISH Yes . Silence . DR . DISH Did I ever tell you how we ragged Professor Groper when I was a student at the old University ? OSBERT I do n't remember . DR . DISH Old Groper had a horse-hair wig  --  people wore them in those days  --  at least people without taste did  --  and old Groper was certainly no dandy . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not let me take honors . I was immeasurably his most brilliant pupil  --  I think I may say it now without vanity  --  but I had refuted all his conclusions about the First Dolichocephalic War . I had even had the temerity  --  or perhaps I should say I had had the impudence  --  to make it the subject of my thesis , and old Groper never forgave me . Osbert looks about him , drops the sifter and throws a small rolled document over the wall . OSBERT There goes another poem . DR . DISH You 'll get in trouble doing that some day . p. 27 OSBERT This one 's not subversive  --  just melancholy . DR . DISH Well , old Groper , as I was saying , revenged himself by withholding my honors . The time came for graduation , and old Groper had to preside . My chums and I put our heads together  --  I had many friends in those days  --  and we hit upon a plan . We went out and caught some biri-biri birds which were nesting in an old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know . Well , on the day of graduation , old Groper turned up with his horse-hair wig in more than usually slovenly condition . We had put the biri-biri birds in boxes  --  OSBERT Oh , yes : I remember now : you have told me that story . DR . DISH Yes : I suppose I have . Another silence : they go on sifting . Two figures come in at the right outside the shack : one is a guard , the other a tall man in his middle forties , with a gaudy plaid suit , a green derby and a very large polka-dotted bow tie : he has red hair and a red bloated face , and his mustache and his hair along his forehead are arranged in rakish curls . BIMBO What is this , for God 's sake ?  --  a jail ? THE GUARD No , buddy : not a jail  --  an industrial training camp . p. 28 BIMBO Industrial training camp be damned ! I was brought here against my will ! THE GUARD You 'll find you like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they reach the door of the shack , Bimbo turns and looks up the wall . BIMBO What a splendid wall ! How high is it ? THE GUARD Eighty bisters , buddy . Bimbo pretends to admire the wall , while the Guard is opening the door , but suddenly snatches for the Guard 's pistol , which the latter carries in a holster on his hip . There is a short violent struggle of which Bimbo gets the worse . The Guard shoves him off and leaves . THE GUARD ( shouting in at the door , before slamming it to ) . Try that again , buddy , and you 'll get sand-papered ! BIMBO ( opening the door and shouting out ) . Try that sand-paper on your ass , buddy ! ( Turning to Osbert and Dr. Dish , and taking off his hat ) I hope you will forgive me , gentlemen : this comic entrance was unintentional . Your guards are a little rough ! DR . DISH They 're good enough fellows when you get to know them . BIMBO ( hopefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . DISH Oh , no ! They 're subjected to a very rigorous discipline . BIMBO I see . And what is it you do here ? DR . DISH We sift sand . BIMBO Ah , you sift sand ! Is that interesting ? DR . DISH It 's not precisely interesting , but one gets used to it . BIMBO I should think it would be rather monotonous . DR . DISH It 's far less monotonous than shovelling it  --  after all , there 's a progression in sifting . According to the Government 's system , they grade the sand-grains in seventy different sizes and for each size we have a separate sieve . First , the smallest grains are sifted out  --  then , the next smallest , and so on  --  till there are only the largest left . When the reservoir has been emptied , we are given a holiday . The different grades are used for different purposes . BIMBO And about how long does it take to sift out the seventy sizes ? DR . DISH That depends : some can do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . OSBERT But surely you 're used to the Desert by this time ? BIMBO It will take me longer than this to get used to it . p. 30 OSBERT Have n't you already served your term as a shoveller ? BIMBO No , my dear fellow  --  I arrived today for the first time . I believe that I heard something said about the shovelling being overmanned and the sifting department short-handed . At any rate , they put me straight in here . DR . DISH Yes , the sifting is done by the intellectuals  --  and the old professional classes  --  and there are fewer and fewer all the time . This is the intellectual section here . When you 've served for five years as a shoveller , if you 're found to have the requisite intelligence , you 're promoted to be a sifter . But you must have a good character , too  --  no eccentrics or fanatics are admitted . We are put upon our word of honor  --  we 're less rigorously watched than the shovellers , but we must promise not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know at once that your suggestion of bribing the guard was not quite in the best of taste . We are put , as I say , on our honor , and we 're allowed to pursue our studies outside our working hours . BIMBO I am sorry to have made such a blunder .  --  And the sand , when it 's sifted , I take it , is used in the manufacture of glass for these beautiful glass cities . OSBERT You call them beautiful ? p. 31 BIMBO I call them ulcers on the crocodile of Hell !  --  How the devil did the people of this country ever come to let themselves in for this insane manufacture of glass ? OSBERT It was Mr. Rudolf 's Glass Company : they discovered some new way of making glass cheaply .  --  Wo n't you come inside ? They enter the shack as the Doctor goes on talking . DR . DISH Mr. Rudolf , the Prince 's Prime Minister , bought up all the forests and stone quarries , before anybody knew what he was doing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had a monopoly on building materials and was in a position to make people pay four times as much for glass houses as they ever had paid for stone ones ! Then he forced the Prince to abdicate and set himself up as Dictator by a coup d ' tat .  --  Yet his regime has been highly successful  --  indeed , his influence , in many ways , has been exceedingly salutary . The old regime was very corrupt . Now we have a much better disciplined government . BIMBO Is this where I 'm supposed to live ? DR . DISH They 'll put in another cot . BIMBO Highly unsafe , these glass houses , I should think . DR . DISH Well , they do n't burn up , of course  --  and it was on the strength of that recommendation that the public was first persuaded to accept them . But they are rather easily wrecked in time of war and easily broken into . And they are subject to all sorts of accidents . An explosion in the Government Glass-Works may sometimes destroy a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then has to rebuild ! OSBERT Some people believe that the Government causes the explosions itself . BIMBO Well , the cause of my imprisonment is plain ! DR . DISH What do you mean ? BIMBO I was trying to sell axes . I thought they were still chopping down trees . DR . DISH Nothing could be more ill-advised ! BIMBO Well , I have sold French post-cards to the English  --  German paintings to the French  --  prayer-books and psalters to the Soviets and harpsichords to the Congo . I have sold all these things and more to the Americans , who will buy anything . DR . DISH It was a fatal mistake to come here . BIMBO True , the axes I was selling were no good . They worked at first and then they crumbled . OSBERT If you explained that to Mr. Rudolf , perhaps he might set you free . BIMBO I doubt it : I find the Glass Government excessively stupid and brutal .  --  Good God ! what a change in these years ! I , too , gentlemen , am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I was young . In those days , life was simple ; there was a population of only a few thousand ; we lived on the edge of the forest . But there was freedom , there was leisure , there was gaiety  --  there were dances and antelope races . We were the happiest people in the world ! And now , when I come back , after many wanderings , I find cities too grim for gaiety and a vast population of slaves content to sift sand in the Desert ! p. 33 DR . DISH Well , you know , it is hard to be sure that History does not justify slavery ! BIMBO A pig 's itch upon History ! What I act is what History must write ! DR . DISH ( glancing out the window ) . And besides , we by no means lack romance  --  for those who are young enough to enjoy it ! ( A knock at the door . ) ( Smiling archly ) Unless I am much mistaken , that is the knock of a very charming lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the shack and has knocked at the side door . She is a tall dark handsome girl , dressed in green . Osbert goes to open the door . DR . DISH ( to Bimbo ) . I think it might be discreet for you and me to withdraw ! Good-evening , Miss Emerald . I have the honor of presenting to you the latest recruit to our company . ( To Bimbo ) I do n't think you 've told us your name . BIMBO ( bowing ) . Call me Bimbo . ( He kisses her hand . ) DR . DISH And I am Dr. Dish and this is Mr. Osbert Rosemary .  --  ( To Emerald ) I hope you will excuse us . Mr. Bimbo and I are going out for a walk . I want to show him our oasis . p. 34 OSBERT No , really  --  really : do n't go . We 'd be delighted to have you stay ! DR . DISH ( smiling ) . I want him to see the oasis before nightfall  --  while the green is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave , Dr. Dish smiling benignantly on the young people . EMERALD You behave in the presence of other people as if you cared nothing about me ! ( Osbert makes no reply . ) You compromise me by having me come here  --  then you make people think you do n't care about me ! OSBERT ( sitting down in a chair beside the table , while Emerald stands upright in the middle of the room ) . I do n't make you come here . You come of your own accord . EMERALD You must n't say that : you must say , " I 'm sorry , dear : I do care for you . " OSBERT ( after a moment 's silence ) . I 'm not going to say anything of the kind . EMERALD That 's what you 're supposed to say : we 've been through this scene a thousand times . Now you say , " I 'm sorry , dear . " OSBERT No : I 'm tired of saying that . p. 35 EMERALD Osbert : are you insane ? You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is what comes of not living in the Married Section : you think that you can treat me without respect ! ( Osbert is silent . ) Oh , Osbert : why not take me to the Married Section ? Then we should n't have these quarrels : it would all be so much easier then ! OSBERT I 'm damned if I 'll go to the Married Section : it 's bad enough as it is ! EMERALD You compromise me ! You neglect me ! And now you tell me you wo n't take me to the Married Section ! I thought that was understood ! OSBERT I tried to leave it very ambiguous . EMERALD How can you look yourself in the face . OSBERT I do n't , except when I have to shave . EMERALD That 's coarse and caddish to talk like that ! And you call yourself a poet !  --  Now you must say , " I 'm sorry , dear " ! OSBERT I do n't call myself anything : I 'm nothing and nobody now ! EMERALD You 're something to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry , dear . EMERALD This whole scene 's in detestable taste ! p. 36 OSBERT I know it , but so is our whole life . So is the sand-sifting camp ! So is Mr. Rudolf 's Government ! EMERALD Be careful ! OSBERT This fellow who came today has made me feel that I 'm buried alive . He comes from here , but went away before the glass-manufacturing began . The whole thing fills him with horror . Dr. Dish and Bimbo have returned , and Dish knocks discreetly at the door . OSBERT Come in . They enter . DR . DISH I do hope you 'll forgive us for coming back : there seems to be a sandstorm looming . EMERALD I 'll ask Dr. Dish to take me home , if it is n't too much trouble ! DR . DISH What ? what ? a lovers ' quarrel ?  --  Plead with her my boy , like a poet ! OSBERT All my pleadings have been in vain . EMERALD ( sitting down in the other chair ) . I insist upon going at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EMERALD ( brusquely getting up ) . All right ! Come , Dr. Dish ! She takes his arm and they go out . p. 37 DR . DISH ( deprecatingly ) . Ah , my dear  --  ! ( As they go off , outside the shack ) Would that these old lips were young , to kiss that pretty pout away ! OSBERT ( to Bimbo ) . Well , did you enjoy the oasis ? BIMBO ( sitting down in a chair ) . I did indeed : charming ! charming ! That pretty old dented tin cup supplied by the Rudolf Government and chained fast to the crystal spring  --  what a delightful feature that is ! OSBERT You think it 's all unspeakable , do n't you ? BIMBO I was trying just now to find words for it . OSBERT Well , it is unspeakable ! When you live here , no matter how much you try not to , you find yourself getting as hard and as colorless and as nameless as a grain of sand ! BIMBO But you have your intellectual pursuits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , I hoped to be a poet  --  today I am nothing at all . When I was working among the shovellers , I still kept on writing poetry  --  I used to publish it under a pseudonym in the Sand-Shovellers ' Gazette , but the Gazette was finally stopped . My poems were revolutionary in those days . Now I almost never write poetry , and when I do , it makes me sick  --  My soul to-day is high as mouldy cheese  --  Its flavor ripened by a million mites  --  Sick stagnant dreams and spent intensities , Cold coddled lusts and unexploded spites ! That 's the sort of way you get , and you decide you might better be dead ! p. 38 BIMBO Well , from my point of view , I confess , the prospect is a little unalluring . Dr. Dish comes back into the shack in time to hear Bimbo 's remark . DR . DISH And what do you mean , pray , by your point of view ? BIMBO ( dramatically getting up ) . I mean the point of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the old days before this Glass Government , our country was the happiest in the world . Prince Louis respected the people and allowed them to do as they pleased , and the people adored the Prince . We settled our own affairs in town meetings so friendly and so informal that we held them in little cafs . We had no particular natural resources except the trees in the forest and so never became very rich  --  but then , on the other hand , nobody envied us , and our neighbors usually left us in peace . We had no industry except logging ; little war ; and no revolution ; no poverty  --  and no riches . Our prisons were practically empty , and our liberal institutions were our boast . I was a forester , not a man from the towns  --  and our life in the forests was rough : we built our own houses and killed our own game . But those woodlands were the temples of freedom !  --  When I tried to revisit the forests just now , I found a high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forbidden . p. 39 DR . DISH That 's to keep people from building wooden houses . BIMBO To keep them from living like freemen , instead of like spiritless slaves ! DR . DISH Do you really believe , my dear sir , that human beings are capable of freedom ? I remember your foresters well  --  they were disorderly creatures at best , at the mercy of their appetites and passions . Can such persons be said to be free ? And had you no wives who blackmailed their husbands ? No husbands who bullied their wives ? no parents who harassed their children ? no children who imposed on their parents ? You had the freedom to range in your forests , but had you the freedom to live up to your own ideals ? Did your own natures leave you free ? Ah , my dear young fellow , it is certain that if History teaches us anything , it is that freedom is a will-o ' - the- wisp : we are always talking about it , but we never manage to attain it  --  and we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my part , I will frankly confess that I neither expect it nor desire it  --  that I never think about it at all . Human beings need a master to tell them what to do , and since some sort of tyranny is inevitable , I prefer a comprehensive and well-administered one , such as Mr. Rudolf gives us . BIMBO ( vehemently ) . If humanity had wished such a fate , we should be living like ants in anthills ! p. 40 DR . DISH We may learn many things from the ant : we may envy him even perhaps . BIMBO Who in God 's name envies an ant ? DR . DISH Mankind may overrate its importance . BIMBO If we 're not important , who is ? If you 're not important , I am ! God forbid I should stay in a place where the slaves are defending their slavery ! DR . DISH I 'm afraid you 'll find it difficult to go elsewhere . BIMBO I may find it difficult , but I 'll go ! DR . DISH My dear fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time it has proved impossible . This wall has been found unscalable , and once you got out of the reservation , you would either be shot by a guard or die of thirst in the desert . I once amused myself by writing a history of the attempts to escape which have been made  --  and I think you will do well to read it before taking any rash action . BIMBO God 's gullet hawk your history ! I 'll be gone from here tonight ! OSBERT I 'll go with you ! DR . DISH Do n't be foolhardy , my boy ! OSBERT I do n't care : I 'm ashamed to stay ! p. 41 DR . DISH Do n't let this foolish fellow carry you away ! You will be sure to end in disaster . BIMBO ( going to the window and hauling in the clothes-line , which he detaches ) . You 'd better not think at all , if you really want to make your getaway !  --  Or think of that human puma Emerald who was harrying you just now ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he finds the clothes-line gone ? BIMBO ( snatching the table-cloth off the table with a single sudden jerk  --  like a juggler in vaudeville  --  so that the cutlery and the china still remain in their places ) . We wo n't be here to care ! ( To Osbert ) Here : help me with this rope ! They cut the rope into four lengths and tie them to the four corners of the table-cloth , with a large knot at the other end . He makes Osbert tie the rope to the back of his belt . DR . DISH ( while this is going on ) . Remember that you gave your word of honor !  --  your word of honor as a man of breeding ! Wait till your ten-year term expires ! OSBERT ( stopping ) . That 's true  --  I gave my word of honor . p. 42 BIMBO ( stuffing bread into his pockets and a bottle of water ) . What 's your honor against your liberty ? He wraps the parachute around him and buttons his coat over it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shovelling ! BIMBO Not me ! DR . DISH They 'll punish me if you escape ! BIMBO I hope the news may never reach us.  --  Now , do n't let me hear another yap out of you ( he picks up a knife from the table and before putting it in his pocket , holds it up for Dr. Dish to see ) or it 'll be the last word on current affairs ever delivered by a distinguished historian !  --  Stay inside and hold your tongue  --  say you did n't know what we were doing . Say you were asleep . ( To Osbert ) Now follow me ! They go out . Dr. Dish goes to the door and watches them through the crack . DR . DISH How desperate he is , poor fellow ! BIMBO ( affably addressing the Guard , who has just come opposite the shack ) . Good evening , sentry . THE GUARD Evening , sir . p. 43 BIMBO Sandstorm blew over it seems . THE GUARD Yes , it 's a lovely calm night . Every star just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their rounds like the sentries , eh ?  --  keeping order up in the sky . ( He takes out a cigar and lights it . ) THE GUARD I 'd hate to have to think that that was all there was to the world ! BIMBO What do you mean ?  --  Have a cigar ? THE GUARD We 're not allowed to smoke on duty .  --  Why , just going the rounds . I mean . BIMBO Ah , you should n't say that , my dear fellow ! What can be nobler than to go the rounds ? We workers with our brains are keeping order with our supervision just as your guardsmen are with your guns . We patrol our appointed beats just as you do  --  alert to seize the madman or the rebel who attempts to violate our discipline .  --  ( Offering him the cigar again and making as if to reach it up ) Take one and smoke it later . THE GUARD I 'm not supposed to come down . BIMBO I do n't want to risk throwing it up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's a Dictator Rudolfo and they 're too precious to waste . p. 44 THE GUARD See , sometimes I might lower the ladder and come down just a little ways , when it was somebody I knew , see  --  but you just came in today and you 're not enrolled as a regular yet . BIMBO That 's true , but I 'm a friend of Mr. Rosemary , who will vouch for my good faith . You know Mr. Rosemary , of course . ( Gesturing toward Osbert , who is standing in the shadow of the shack ) THE GUARD ( noticing him for the first time ) . Oh , yes : good-evening , sir . OSBERT Good evening , Lemuel . BIMBO ( passing the cigar to Osbert ) . Here , hand this up to him , Berty . ( To the Guard ) Yes , Guard , Mr. Rosemary and I are , like you , among the satellites of the great system that revolves about the Dictator , and we are well content to keep to our beats . THE GUARD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here as an inside observer . The Guard lets down a rope-ladder . Osbert comes forward holding up the cigar . The Guard , with his gun in his right hand begins to descend the ladder , holding on with his left hand . Bimbo suddenly jumps and grabs the butt of the gun , which goes off in the air . Between trying to save the gun and trying to hold on to the ladder , the Guard falls to the ground , and Bimbo leaps upon him and stabs him with the table-knife. p. 45 BIMBO Quick ! Up the ladder ! He and Osbert climb quickly up and stand on top of the wall , where Bimbo shakes out the parachute . BIMBO Quick : climb on my back ! ( He crouches down , and Osbert climbs on his back . ) OSBERT Poor fellow ! He had a touch of the poet ! BIMBO What 's that greenery over there ? OSBERT Mr. Rudolf 's Pleasure-Garden . BIMBO Now for the flight of the lark and the eagle !  --  Ready : go ! ( He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shack ) . What romanticism ! Two guards , alarmed by the shot , run up from opposite directions along the wall and fire down toward Bimbo and Osbert . DR . DISH They will never succeed ! p. 46 Act 2 , Scene 2 SCENE 2 An open-air pavilion in Mr. Rudolf 's Pleasure-Garden , lighted up as if for some gaiety . There is a dancing-floor and , at the right in the foreground , a platform with chairs and music-stands for an orchestra . The walls are lattices , overgrown with various kinds of flowers and with openings at regular intervals . The whole place is paved with moonlight . Distant music is heard from the Casino . Osbert and Bimbo have just landed outside ; the parachute lies beside them on the ground . Bimbo gathers it up and Osbert detaches the ropes from his belt . Bimbo hides it offstage , presumably behind a bush . BIMBO What an exhilarating flight ! It 's lucky we had the wind behind us . OSBERT Up there we seemed as free as birds soaring over the meadows in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now earth has laid our flight by the heels , and we are challenged by human works . BIMBO Where are we ?  --  do you know ? OSBERT Yes : I think I recognize it  --  it 's a sort of open-air ball-room that 's near the old Casino . BIMBO What ? Of course ! It used to belong to the Summer Palace . I have danced here a hundred times !  --  and with the prettiest girl of the season ! p. 47 OSBERT ( looking out through one of the doors ) . It reminds me of something , too . The last time I was in a garden and smelt grass and flowers growing  --  it 's five years ago now  --  I 'd gone to meet the girl I was in love with , and she was coming to the city to join me , and we thought we were going to be married  --  and now I come back an outlaw , and I do n't even know where she is !  --  I suppose we must n't ever trust life . They supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are new roads and they turn out to take us to the wilderness . A golden and argentine crowing is heard : the sound of the music has ceased . BIMBO ( apprehensively ) . What 's that noise ? OSBERT It 's such a long time since I 've heard it ! It 's the crowing of the gold and silver pheasants in what used to be Prince Louis 's gardens . If they were n't Mr. Rudolf 's now , how exquisite their voices would sound ! How they would blend with this fragile moonlight and with these odors , acrid and vague ! How our shrillest , most passionate purposes would seem to run silvery-thin ! BIMBO Good Heavens ! my dear boy  --  they 've finally got you reduced to a state where you hardly seem to want to act . We 'd better get out of these gardens ! p. 48 OSBERT Yes : I 've been reduced to doubt everything . What 's a moment 's beauty here ? We 'll be caught when it 's light again  --  what good will it have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life that allows us the illusion of beauty . It 's only when we 're no longer balked by our being at cross-purposes with others . It 's only when the voices of men are still , the roads empty and the houses shuttered  --  only then may the poet bemuse himself with imaginings of harmony and happiness ! ( Composing ) : Bright day dislimns the soul with sights undreamed , Dull darkness lightens all through blinded eyes  --  BIMBO For God 's sake , stop : you make me nervous !  --  Do you know exactly where we are ? OSBERT Right in the middle of the gardens , I 'm afraid . BIMBO Look out : there 's somebody coming ! They hide behind a lattice . Queenie and Lucille enter , dressed as cigarette girls : red aprons and red suspenders over short white dresses : bobbed hair and little red pill-box hats on one side of their heads ; round red spots of rouge on their cheeks . QUEENIE Mr. Trixie has been so kind to me : he promised me a pair of brass ear-rings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 49 QUEENIE But he said they were valuable antiques ! LUCILLE If they 're antiques , they 're the kind that are n't valuable . Both those boys are full of meringue . OSBERT ( stepping out from behind the lattice ) . Lucille ! QUEENIE Oh , Berty ! LUCILLE Well , for Heaven 's sake ! Look who 's here ! OSBERT Do n't talk too loud : I 've escaped from the Desert . LUCILLE ( smiling ) . Well , you 've certainly got nerve ! OSBERT We jumped off the ramparts with a parachute .  --  But what are you doing here ? LUCILLE Hustling cigarettes . OSBERT I was just thinking of you tonight when we landed in the gardens  --  I thought of that night that I met you in the garden just before I left home .  --  You must tell me all that 's happened to you ! QUEENIE Oh , I 've thought of you always , Berty ! I 've read your poems over and over ! You know that poem you gave Lucille  --  I pasted it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! OSBERT Why did n't Lucille paste it in her memory-book ? p. 50 QUEENIE Lucille does n't keep a memory-book . BIMBO ( appearing from behind the lattice ) . If you will pardon me  --  I 'm a friend of Berty 's and a fellow fugitive  --  our most pressing problem just now is to get away from these gardens . LUCILLE There 's a big party on tonight and they 're checking up on everybody that goes through the gate . BIMBO Mr. Rudolf 's police wo n't take bribes ? LUCILLE No : you better not try to get by them . BIMBO And the people submit to this ! LUCILLE They 're beginning to get sore now  --  everybody hates the police . ( Looking around to see no one is listening ) I hear a lot of talk nowadays that Mr. Rudolf 's government may crash ! BIMBO Crash ? Do you mean a revolution ? LUCILLE There 's been a lot of trouble lately over this big Transparency question . BIMBO Transparency ? What do you mean ? LUCILLE Mr. Rudolf 's got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transparent glass instead of the kind you ca n't see through . It costs extra to glaze them and stain the glass , and the police ca n't see through the walls . p. 51 BIMBO A very trying state of things , I should  --  He stops as two figures come in through one of the forward entrances and stand talking at the front of the stage . They are Trixie and Tiralira . They wear elegant uniforms : Trixie 's is a pale violet and Tiralira 's a canary yellow . MR . TIRALIRA Do n't make her expect too much , old boy : do n't give her too much at first ! MR . TRIXIE No Archie , I 've been charming with her , but firm . Oh , Archie : you have no idea what this Strength-Suggestion treatment has done for me ! I used to be so pliable , so volatile , so shy , so unsure of myself ! You remember how easily influenced I was  --  and how the presence of the opposite sex used to throw me into a state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Psychic Inventory , all my shyness has disappeared : I have become resourceful , steadfast , alert !

QUEENIE ( coming forward ) . Oh , Mr. Trixie ! MR . TRIXIE ( starting violently ) . Oh , my dear : how you startled me ! p. 52 QUEENIE Mr. Trixie , there are two friends of ours here who have been working on the decorations and they have n't got any cards yet . The man who makes the cards out has gone home , and they 're afraid that the gate-keeper wo n't understand and may not let them get out of the gardens . Could n't you give them a pass so they can get through the gate ? MR . TRIXIE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  MR . TIRALIRA Two friends of yours ? What are they doing here ? How is it they do n't have passes ? BIMBO They forgot to give us any . MR . TIRALIRA ( aside to Trixie ) . I 'm afraid that our little friends are trifling with us ! ( He comes closer and looks at Bimbo and Osbert . OSBERT Why , Mr. Tiralira ! MR . TIRALIRA Ah , well , well , my boy  --  it 's you ! ( Shaking hands with him cordially . ) How lovely to see you here !  --  and how unexpected ! I thought you were still winning your chevrons among our gallant soldiers of the sands ! BIMBO They just took us out for the party tonight . OSBERT We 're supposed to go back now  --  but if they wo n't let us through the gate , we 'll have to spend the night on the grass . p. 53 MR . TIRALIRA I 'm awfully sorry , old boy , but we have no authority to give passes .  --  Who sent you here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the Palace with me , and I 'll try to get in touch with him .  --  It 's a rotten shame you should be bothered , and I wish I could do something for you sooner , but with all this anti-Transparency nonsense , they have to be particularly careful just now about letting people in or out of the gardens .  --  I suppose you 've heard about poor dear Mrs. Megrim ? OSBERT No : what has happened to her ? MR . TIRALIRA She broke up on her way to the Spa , and we could n't do anything but collect the pieces . But I 've had her put together and beautifully mounted for Mr. Rudolf 's museum . Two figures enter from the right . Tiralira , seeing them , and stretching out his arms on each side , makes Osbert and Bimbo fall back behind the lattice and motions Trixie to fall back into a doorway ; he himself remains looking through the doorway in such a way as not to be seen by the newcomers , and listens to their conversation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wears a red business suit , an orange derby and a fine blond mustache , while the other has a coarse dark mustache and plain dark clothes . They are the Head Stainer and the Head Glazer of Mr. Rudolf 's Glass Government . p. 54 THE HEAD STAINER ( nervously , taking out his watch ) . It 's almost five minutes past twelve . THE HEAD GLAZER Do n't get nervous  --  wait for the flare . THE HEAD STAINER What time have you got , Head Glazer ? THE HEAD GLAZER I do n't know . Do n't worry  --  we 'll see the flare . THE HEAD STAINER Suppose Mr. Rudolf should suspect something and refuse to leave the Palace . THE HEAD GLAZER He wo n't , though  --  do n't worry , Stainer . He 'd never suspect the Admiral . Old Flogger will make him walk in the gardens on the pretext of discussing the new gunboats , and as soon as they 're behind the big fountain , our men will gag Mr. Rudolf , pop him into an old fertilizer sack and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Palace Guards will have taken the Summer Palace and the Capitol . The people will support the revolution  --  in fact , they 're more than half expecting it . THE HEAD STAINER What a day of joy for the people , Glazer ! Their right to live in privacy again ! And their right to revel in color ! They shall have more brilliant color than they ever have dreamed of ! THE HEAD GLAZER The only thing that worries me now , Stainer , is  --  suppose Mr. Rudolf 's supporters cause trouble  --  you and I may have to make speeches to the people  --  and we 're craftsmen , not politicians . Mr. Rudolf 's banished all the politicians who did n't support the Glass Government . What we need is a political spellbinder  --  The music suddenly stops . p. 55 THE HEAD STAINER There ! the music has stopped ! A red flare lights up at the back of the stage . MR . TIRALIRA ( to Trixie ) . They 've set out to overthrow the government ! That 's the Head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goodness ! had n't we better get away ! They may shoot us for being loyal to Mr. Rudolf ! MR . TIRALIRA Are we all that loyal , old boy ? Where will your color combinations be if the edict against color is issued and you can only do sofa-cushions for the Palace ?  --  Do n't run : we 're as well off here as anywhere . Shouts and cheers have been heard , drawing nearer . A detachment of Guards appears from the left , marching in twos . The Captain salutes the Stainer and the Glazer , who have mounted on the platform to the right . They return the salute , touching their derbies . THE CAPTAIN OF THE GUARDS The Palace , sir , has been taken . Mr. Rudolf is under arrest . I hereby put off the Iron Pansy of Mr. Rudolf 's Glass Government and declare my allegiance to the Government of Glazed and Colored Glass . He strips the Iron Pansy from the right side of his breast , and the other Guards do the same . They throw them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 56 THE CAPTAIN OF THE GUARDS Long live Stainer and Glazer ! THE GUARDS Long live Stainer and Glazer ! In the course of this scene and the scene that follows , Rudolf 's revellers drift in . Some are outrageously ugly , others grotesquely deformed ; some have half-witted faces , or lack eyes , nose or mouth . All are , however , dressed correctly in evening clothes . The only normal-looking persons among them are a young man and his young wife : she is pretty and demure , he wears round bone-rimmed spectacles and carries a piece of lead pipe . There are two large birds and a bear , all in uniform . Waiters mingle with the crowd . THE HEAD GLAZER Mr. Rudolf 's Government has surrendered . The country will be run in the future by the Government of Stainers and Glazers . We usher in a new period of prosperity . Hereafter every house will be glazed .  --  Some cheering among the crowd , and one wild and crazy guffaw . THE HEAD GLAZER ( turning to the Stainer ) . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a gift of gab than I have .  --  ( Turning to the crowd ) Fellow-citizens , the Head Stainer will address you . He will outline to you more eloquently than I can the new policies and programs of our Government . p. 57 THE HEAD STAINER ( addressing the crowd with sincere enthusiasm and feeling ) . Fellow citizens ! Fellow glass-house-dwellers ! This is a day for thanksgiving and rejoicing . We had been threatened by Mr. Rudolf 's Government with the loss of our right to live in privacy and with the loss of our right to color . But tonight Mr. Rudolf 's Government has fallen and these rights are once again secure ! ( Some cheering ) Why , color ! My Fellow-Citizens  --  think of a world deprived of color !  --  as , save for the officials in their uniforms , we were well on our way to becoming . The colors !  --  we inherit them with life itself , with the light that lifts us out of the slime . They are the riches , the inexhaustible treasury , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Red ! Orange ! Yellow ! Green ! Blue ! Purple ! Violet !  --  the Blessed Mystic Seven of the Spectrum ! Why , without the right to build and dress in color  --  with all the houses transparent and colorless , and all the clothing gray  --  how should we have answered the summons of the light ? We should have been more wretched than the lowest golden beetle , more sickly than the commonest rosy-breasted bird ! Every match that we scratched would have mocked us with its red and yellow flame !  --  every dewdrop would have put us to shame ! We should have gone mad with sullenness and sadness for never having answered the light ! And now with the definite defeat of Mr. Rudolf 's dull and sullen government , we shall be free to speak the language of the sun : Red ! Orange ! Yellow ! Green ! Blue ! Purple ! Violet ! And all the colors that lie between or which the cunning of man may combine  --  bright sapphires and canaries and vermilions ! rich heliotropes and sepias and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Peacock-Green ! Poppy-Red ! Coxcomb-Red ! Oxblood-Red ! ! Claret-lees Red ! ! ! Hoots and squawks from the crowd , insane laughter . p. 58 OSBERT ( to Lucille ) . Who are all those awful creatures ? LUCILLE They 're Mr. Rudolf 's retinue : his councillors and officials . OSBERT I already had a low opinion of Rudolf , but I 'm surprised at his having that bear . LUCILLE He 's not so bad when you get to know him . OSBERT Mr. Rudolf ? LUCILLE No , I mean the bear . Glazer has laid a hand on the Stainer 's arm as the latter was about to continue his speech . THE HEAD GLAZER Listen here : go easy on that color stuff . After all , they do n't need color to keep their houses from being seen into . We can talk about color later . The main thing to give them is glazing . THE HEAD STAINER ( fervent and indignant ) . I will never allow the people to be deprived of the sacred spectrum ! Excited and adverse murmurs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE GUARDS ( who has posted his men at the back of the stage ) . Somebody had better say something to them . We do n't want to use violence , if we can help it . And we do n't want to let this bunch get out of hand : some of them have got nasty teeth and claws . Bimbo has made his way through the crowd from the other side of the stage and , coming up on the platform behind them , addresses Glazer and Stainer. p. 59 BIMBO Gentlemen : allow me to present myself ! I am a citizen of the old free Principality and a fugitive from Mr. Rudolf 's Government . I was considered something of an orator in the old days , when oratory was still cultivated in this country  --  and , if you 'd permit me , I 'd be delighted to say a word or two to this crowd in behalf of our free institutions . You are great statesmen , Mr. Stainer and Mr. Glazer  --  you are incomparable executives , but you are unskilled in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the proper words at this crisis , you may find yourselves in unnecessary difficulties . I have been a politician as well as a salesman  --  it 's more or less the same thing . THE HEAD GLAZER ( somewhat rattled , to Stainer ) . Can we trust him ? BIMBO ( addressing the assembly ) . Fellow-Citizens : I come before you to announce the victory of liberty and justice  --  the vindication of those free institutions which are our heritage , our glory and our pride ! A great insult , Fellow-Citizens , has been offered to our traditional liberties  --  a great crime against them has been attempted ! It had been proposed by the former ruler to deprive our people of their privacy  --  to take away the decent protection of their houses and to expose them naked and shameless  --  to throw thousands of them out of work . But , fortunately , champions of the people were found  --  true men of action , true leaders , true prophets  --  to call for an accounting  --  to sound a clarion-call  --  and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! And the men of the National Guard have arisen to a man to answer that call and to stand behind that knock-out blow ! Hereafter the Stainers ' and Glazers ' Government will see to it that the houses of the people are well glazed and stained with bright color as houses should be glazed and stained ! The Guards and the waiters cheer , but the creatures hoot and murmur ominously. p. 60 THE CAPTAIN OF THE GUARDS ( to Bimbo ) . Do n't talk too much about the people 's rights . Some of these people are heads of departments and the regulations do n't affect them  --  they 're only afraid of losing their jobs . BIMBO Right you are ! ( He turns to the audience . ) Some of you loyal citizens here may dread a change of government . That is a very natural feeling and a very sound feeling  --  but let me hasten to allay your apprehensions . Though the government has changed hands , the economic structure will not suffer . Not a wheel will cease from turning , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the majestic machine of the Glass Government ! You know Mr. Glazer and Mr. Stainer for the responsible public servants they are . I see among you some heads of government departments , and such men will not need to be told that the interests of the Glazers and the Stainers are identical with your own . If they quarrel with the policy of the last government , it is partly because they believe that , under Mr. Rudolf 's regime , the officials of the Glass Government received very much less than their due . Fellow-Citizens , for a quarter of a century Mr. Rudolf has been growing rich at our expense . Not only has he barely allowed the people a living wage , he has prevented the holders of public office  --  men at least as industrious , as able , as indispensable as he  --  from sharing in the recent profits . While the people have dressed in the coarsest clothes and eaten unwhitened bread  --  while the public officials themselves , the mainstays and helmsmen of our commonwealth , have been forced to live on pitifully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and has eaten gardenia salad . While the rest of us have been sifting and shovelling sand  --  or performing arduous administrative duties  --  Mr. Rudolf has occupied his leisure by racing mechanical antelopes ! Fellow-Citizens : we Stainers and Glazers believe that there is no reason on earth why every man in this country  --  nay , why every woman and child  --  should not clothe himself in gold-leaf and eat gardenia salad , too . And in the new era of productivity and plenty there is no reason why our beloved children should not have mechanical antelopes to play with ! Cheering ; the birds squawk ; the bear growls. p. 61 BIMBO ( to the Glazer ) . That fetches ' em , you see ! Tiralira bustles up to the platform and gives a hand each to Stainer and Glazer . MR . TIRALIRA Gentlemen , I congratulate you ! I salute the new regime ! I shall circulate among the guests and do what I can to reassure them . A tactful word here and there might be useful in making things smoother . He mingles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another , holding the women 's hands , putting his arm around the men 's shoulders , earnestly and vivaciously conversing with them . A NOSELESS MAN IN THE CROWD What about the tariff ? BIMBO The new government will protect home industries and at the same time preserve the advantages of free trade . Applause . A MEGALOCEPHALIC DWARF What about the national debt ? BIMBO The new government will pay it immediately by exporting sand abroad . Applause as before . Bimbo tries to go on speaking , but the Birds begin to squawk so loudly that he can not make himself heard . BIMBO ( to the Captain of the Guard ) . Ca n't those confounded birds be kept quiet ? p. 62 THE CAPTAIN OF THE GUARDS We ca n't afford to offend them . They 're very prominent in public affairs . AN ARMLESS MAN What about the mutilated glass-workers ? BIMBO They will be supported at the expense of the city , but without increasing the taxes . A WOMAN ( who looks like a bird ) . What about the rights of birds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to the platform , stands on his hind legs and wildly howls . BIMBO The new government will be partly elective , and we want it clearly understood that the voice of every animal and the voice of every bird  --  of whatever size , species or sex  --  will have its weight in the common councils !  --  ( In the course of this speech , the Bear has been sniffing at Bimbo 's ankles , and the speaker now turns to the Captain . ) This bear is a little overwrought . I do n't think it understands what is being said . THE CAPTAIN OF THE GUARDS It 's the young fellow with the lead-pipe that 's dangerous . You 'd better keep your eye on him . I 'm watching my chance to get it away from him without making trouble . BIMBO I believe that some music would be effective at this point . Have n't you got a band that could play something patriotic ? p. 63 THE CAPTAIN OF THE GUARDS A good idea ! I 'll have them here right away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ YOUNG MAN WITH THE LEAD-PIPE ( to Osbert ) . What an amazing gift of eloquence your friend has . HIS WIFE Yes : we think he 's the most exciting speaker we 've ever heard ! OSBERT He 's a patriot of the old-fashioned type . THE YOUNG MAN WITH THE LEAD-PIPE ( candid , good-humored , holding the lead-pipe in one hand and tapping it gently in the palm of the other ) . I 've always worked for Mr. Rudolf , of course  --  and I 'm sorry to hear him given a bad character  --  which I can assure you he does n't deserve  --  but I think that your friend is a magnificent orator . Tiralira , in the course of his rounds , comes between the young man and his wife and familiarly takes each by the arm . THE YOUNG MAN WITH THE LEAD-PIPE Oh , Tiralira ! What luck ! I was just wishing I could ask your advice . I wanted to inquire your attitude toward this movement . I trust your judgment so much and I 'm trying to form an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to form an opinion myself , old boy  --  but I think it 's important to keep people quiet . p. 64 THE YOUNG MAN WITH THE LEAD-PIPE Yes , of course  --  you 're entirely right , and if there was ever an occasion in the world when your tact and social charm were needed  --  MR . TIRALIRA Do n't be silly , old boy  --  I 'm the most bungling person alive ! He turns to go , and the Young Man swiftly clubs him with the lead-pipe . Tiralira drops ; the Young Man and his wife slip away . MR . TRIXIE Help ! Help ! Archie has been assassinated ! Confusion : a group gathers around . Bimbo seizes the opportunity , while the general attention is diverted , to take a gun from one of the Guards and shoot the Bear , which falls dead beside the platform . This increases the disturbance in the crowd . The Young Man with the Lead-Pipe reappears . THE YOUNG MAN WITH THE LEAD-PIPE This bear has been executed without a trial ! Ladies and Gentlemen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hearing ! Are we to submit to a Reign of Terror ? Sounds of indignation . At a signal from the Captain , the Guards seize the Young Man , wrest away his lead-pipe and carry him off the scene . His Wife produces a revolver and shoots at the revolutionary leaders , making a hole in Bimbo 's derby , which he takes off and coolly examines . The Guards seize her and bundle her off . p. 65 BIMBO Men and Women of the Free Principality ! Let there be no more acts of violence ! The new government was not the first to use violence  --  but since violence has been attempted , we must meet violence with violence ! Any person who offers resistance will be arrested and held for high treason . The punishment for treason is death . Do not imitate this foolish bear , who , however much we may have loved him and admired his rugged and loyal nature , must be admitted at a time like this to have been dangerous to the general welfare , since his grasp of human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not able to comprehend the benefits which the new Glazers ' and Stainers ' order was bringing him .

A CRETIN Aw , what 're you talkin ' about ? He could n't do nothin ' as good as a man ! BIMBO The National Military Band has arrived . Freedom and prosperity have triumphed ! Let us celebrate the dawn of a new era ! The band strikes up a march : there are cries of " Long live the Stainers and Glazers ! " Mrs. Rosemary appears among the crowd and is evidently looking for someone . When she comes near the platform , she cries out in amazement as she recognizes Bimbo. p. 66 MRS . ROSEMARY Belisarius ! BIMBO Marguerite ! MRS . ROSEMARY Why , what are you doing here ? BIMBO I came back to find you , my darling ! ( He embraces her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ danced in this very pavilion ! OSBERT ( recognizing his mother ) . Mother ! MRS . ROSEMARY And Osbert , my boy , too !  --  I had come to intercede with the government to get you released from the Desert . BIMBO Mr. Rudolf has been overthrown : a new and liberal regime has begun . MRS . ROSEMARY Yes : I have heard about it . The Head Stainer is a cousin of mine . He was the only one of our family who succeeded under Mr. Rudolf , and I had come to appeal to him about Osbert .  --  Belisarius : this is your son . Osbert : this is your father ! I told you that he was dead because I was ashamed of his having left me . And I took the name of Rosemary to make me forget his . I tried to fill my heart with you and with tying pink ribbons on the furniture , but somehow it was never enough . OSBERT Bimbo my father ! BIMBO Do n't be horrified , my boy .

ROSEMARY ( who has been talking with the Stainer ) . This is your Cousin Clarence , Osbert  --  and this , Clarence , is my husband . THE HEAD STAINER You must stay with us and help us with our task . BIMBO And you shall be Poet Laureate , Osbert ! OSBERT Lucille : will you marry me ? LUCILLE ( grinning ) . Do you still love me ?

The Creatures have begun to dance . Mrs. Rosemary is dancing with Bimbo. @x The Dictator 's office and its anteroom , in the Dictator 's palace . The office is on the left and occupies about three-quarters of the stage : it is partitioned off from the anteroom by a wall with an interconnecting door . There are a large desk at the left with an executive 's chair for the Dictator and another chair for visitors , a window in the back wall and , between the desk and the window , a door which leads into the Palace . The room had originally been furnished in a semi-regal manner , but has now certain touches inspired by the memory of Mrs. Rosemary 's house in Act I : large pink bows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desk . In the anteroom at the right , a man in leather overalls  --  evidently a workman  --  is sitting : he is gaunt and appears morose . As soon as the curtain has risen , a page in a rose-pink uniform ushers in a second visitor through a door in the right-hand wall . The newcomer is a man of gigantic stature , with hair that sticks straight up on his head and large glaring eyes  --  he wears high boots , corduroy breeches and a leather packet . He takes a seat next to the man in the overalls . THE PAGE Wait here : His Excellency will see you . THE MAN IN THE BOOTS ( to the man in the overalls , after eyeing him a minute ) . Glass-worker ? p. 69 THE WORKER Glass-marble worker . THE MAN IN THE BOOTS You 've come about the riots , eh ? THE WORKER Yeah . ( After a moment ) What kind of clothes are those you 've got on ? THE MAN IN THE BOOTS ( with pride ) . I 'm a forester @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You do n't say . So you 're one of those foresters ! Well , that 's a way out , I suppose . But I hear that they 're going to raise hell with you , the same as they have with us . THE FORESTER They 've served an ultimatum on us , and I 've come to talk to Mr. Osbert . I believe he 's always been a liberal , and I do n't think he can really be against us . THE WORKER Liberal ? The marble-workers are starving while the Dictator sits in his palace and wears gold-leaf and eats gardenia salad !  --  And what 's the use of going into the forests ? They would n't be big enough to hold us all , even if they let us stay there . Sooner or later it 's got to come to a show-down  --  The Forester holds up a warning finger , as he hears the sound of a bell from the next room . While the Marble-Worker has been talking , Osbert has entered his office from the door that leads into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He examines the papers on his desk , then rings a bell on the desk . The Forester and the Marble-Worker continue their conversation in low voices . p. 70 OSBERT Is the marble-worker here ? THE PAGE Yes , Your Excellency . Queenie comes into the office from the Palace . She is a matronly woman now . QUEENIE ( laying a large scrap-book on the desk ) . I 've brought you a surprise , Berty ! OSBERT Why , what 's this ? ( Opening the book ) My old poems  --  good heavens ! QUEENIE I went through all the files of the old papers and cut them out and pasted them in ! OSBERT How sweet of you ! ( Turning over the pages ) What awful rubbish , though ! I have n't thought about it for years . QUEENIE Oh , no , Berty !  --  some of them are really splendid  --  I was quite thrilled when I read them again . OSBERT You 've even got the stuff I used to write to Lucille . QUEENIE Yes : I kept it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OSBERT ( kissing her ) . Thank you very much , my dear  --  I 'll look through it later on . I must attend to business now . p. 71 QUEENIE Do n't stay beyond lunch-time , Osbert . You know that it gives you a headache to work on an empty stomach . OSBERT Yes , dear : now you must go . I 've got a lot of people to see , and I 'm late for my appointments as it is . She kisses him again and goes out . OSBERT ( to the Page ) . Have the marble-worker come in . THE PAGE Yes , Your Excellency . The Marble-Worker enters . OSBERT ( shaking hands with him cordially ) . How do you do . Sit down , wo n't you ? THE WORKER I 'm sorry to come in my overalls , sir  --  but it 's the only clothes that I 've got . OSBERT Are you so badly off as that ? THE WORKER That is what we were rioting about . OSBERT I wish you would tell me exactly what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know , and do n't always know what 's what . THE WORKER Five hundred glass-marble workers have been thown out of work and they 're starving  --  that 's what 's been happening , Mr. Osbert . OSBERT Mr. Megim informed me two weeks ago that he had offered employment on his place to all the men who have been thrown out of work . p. 72 THE WORKER Mr. Megrim has a big place , but he can hardly use five hundred workers . OSBERT It seems to me your attitude toward Mr. Megrim has n't been a very patient or tactful one  --  when you break the windows of his aviary and allow his valuable birds to escape . THE WORKER It was two months before we did that  --  in the meantime we 'd been dying of hunger and cold . OSBERT I did n't know that things were as bad as that . THE WORKER That 's why I 'm here to tell you . OSBERT I 'll have an investigation made at once , and if conditions are as serious as you say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why not get somebody else to manage the Glass-Marble industry ? Almost anybody could run it better . OSBERT But who else has Mr. Megrim 's experience ? There 's probably nobody else in the world who understands marble-making as he does . THE WORKER I understand that Megrim 's a friend of yours , and if that 's so , you must realize that he 's not a business man . He may know a lot about designing marbles , but as a business man , he 's a good owl-fancier  --  and while Megrim 's busy breeding owls , his employees ca n't breed human beings ! p. 73 OSBERT Harry Megrim is an old friend of mine , and it is true that he belongs to the old regime  --  so that it 's true that he 's a little impractical because he 's idealistic.  --  But let me tell you precisely what happened . At the time of Mr. Rudolf 's dictatorship , Mr. Rudolf , knowing Harry was fond of owls , appointed him to a post in his aviary . But as Harry 's favorite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuffed , and he thus became interested in taxidermy . He used to go to the department of the glass-works where the glass eyes were made and have glass eyes especially designed for his owls . The effects were often startling and weird : he has always had an original turn of mind . My father , Mr. Bimbo , when he came to succeed Mr. Rudolf , with a characteristically generous gesture , put Harry in charge of the glass-eye department . Nobody then dreamed that it would ever become important . But Harry began designing children 's marbles  --  they are , of course , very much like glass-eyes . Then playing with children 's marbles became a great fad for grown-ups  --  and Harry Megrim , without having intended it , and , in fact , very much to his surprise , suddenly found himself at the head of a successful business !  --  THE WORKER And how long was the business successful ?  --  There 's nothing to the marble business , Mr. Osbert  --  only children really care about marbles . The whole demand for marble-playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It lasted for a year and a half  --  then it began to dawn on the public that they did n't really want to play marbles the way the ads said they did . And there was Megrim 's making millions of marbles which nobody would ever buy  --  and then there was half the plant shut down and us marble-workers out of luck ! p. 74 OSBERT I 'm sorry about that , as I 've told you , and I 'll see to it that something is done . I 'm very grateful to you for coming here and telling me exactly what 's wrong . But I must ask you not to make things hard for Harry . Such rioting as you have been doing will not , of course , in any case , be tolerated by the government  --  but even aside from that , I can assure you that it may prejudice Harry against giving you work on his place . He is a shy and sensitive man , and any violent action on your part may put him out of sympathy with you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him and ready to coperate with him , you will find him , I think , kind and humane . And remember that he has only one arm . Osbert rises , and the visitor rises . THE WORKER Well , kind and humane or not , he certainly ought to be checked on ! I understand that his advertizing man 's persuaded him that there might be a booming market for glass eyes in the top of pincushions . OSBERT ( smiling ) . Well , they might be very charming , might n't they ? Of course , there 'd be a face behind them . THE WORKER It does n't make any sense . Glass-eyed pincushions would give me the willies . OSBERT ( shaking hands ) . You 'll excuse me if I must break off now  --  I have still two other people this morning . Thank you very much for coming . Goodby . The Worker goes out . Osbert rings the bell for the Page and consults a list on the desk . p. 75 OSBERT ( as the Page appears ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Excellency . OSBERT Have him come in . He adopts toward the Forester , when he enters , a curter and more peremptory manner . OSBERT Sit down , please . ( The Forester sits down . ) Well , it seems , sir , that you people are determined to defy the rulings of the Government ! THE FORESTER What harm does it do the Government for a few hundred men to live in the forest ? OSBERT At first it was a few dozen . My father did n't interfere with that . Today it is several thousand , who are becoming a threat to the State . To allow people to go freely to the forests and to build themselves wooden houses is to allow our society to be undermined , attacked in its very foundations . Sooner or later I should have to meet the issue  --  I should have to oppose your renegades , and I prefer to take a stand now , before it comes down to bloodshed . You have already had the Government 's ultimatum , and I can only repeat it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the forest at once  --  your houses will have to be destroyed  --  the Government will be perfectly satisfied , and find you employment in the glass works . p. 76 THE FORESTER With these unemployment riots going on ? Why not send the unemployed to the forests ? There is still room for many more . And it 's possible to plant more forests . There 's a kind of waste on the other side , but the waste is not too sandy for cultivation . OSBERT They could n't adapt themselves to your wild kind of life , and I am assured that such a policy would be economically unsound . THE FORESTER Tell me , if you please , Mr. Osbert , why should n't people live in wooden houses ? They 're much safer and much more comfortable than glass ones . OSBERT You must know as well as I do that we are forced to be a glass-manufacturing country . Our whole prosperity is based on glass . We have vast deserts , but very few forests , and the quarries were exhausted years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wood and stone before the forests and the quarries were bought up by Mr. Rudolf so that he could make his millions out of glass . OSBERT But we had then a tiny population , hardly five percent of the present one  --  a mere scattering of villages and country estates along the seaward fringe of the Desert . That society had its distinction and its charm  --  I used to know it and should be the last to belittle it  --  but we can not have it back now if we would . We must keep a tight grasp on our present realities . In our modern world , it is glass which has given our country the power to develop from a little patch hardly visible on the map to a country of tenth-rate importance . By a series of audacious conquests under my father , Mr. Bimbo 's leadership , we have extended our glass civilization many kilometers along the shore , and it is glass and glass alone which feeds and clothes our two million people ! p. 77 THE FORESTER Mr. Osbert , I have always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And I have tried to convince my fellow foresters that when you came to the dictatorship , we should not any longer be hounded . OSBERT The most intelligent and salutary thing I can do is to prevent you felling timber for houses . The Forester 's eye falls on the scrapbook of Osbert 's poems , which has been left open on the desk . THE FORESTER What an irony to find on your desk the very poems which so moved me in my youth !  --  the very poems which  --  OSBERT That old stuff of mine is horribly bad . At least it 's horribly dated . I 'm sorry to hear you admired it . THE FORESTER I mean Luke Bronkus 's poems  --  you have them here in this book  --  OSBERT I used to write under the name of Luke Bronkus in the days of the censorship . THE FORESTER What  --  you wrote the poems signed Luke Bronkus ?  --  those cries of indignation and revolt ! It was those poems that first spurred my spirit to rebel against Mr. Rudolf  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to break away to the woods ! " Rise from your sands , O slaves !  --  The sun still flees the East  --  Turn not toward darkness yet  --  the bones of toil are strong ! " p. 78 OSBERT That was a phase that I quickly got over  --  THE FORESTER ( much excited ) . Why , sir , it was that poetry of yours which first kindled in me the spark of hope ! I was a sullen soldier of the Desert , living amidst brutality and ignorance , lounging loutishly in my barracks by day , patrolling the ramparts at night , keeping watch over my miserable prisoners and just as much a prisoner as they were . But when I read that great diary of the spirit of yours , when I found out that there was another man like me who could not accept the Desert and the prison  --  then I plucked up courage to put my faith in the vision of human dignity and freedom : " What man has bound his brother may unbind ! " OSBERT That was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were actually imprisoned , but , as you know , my father changed all that . They now come and go as they please . THE FORESTER But they 're not able to leave the country and they ca n't work at anything but glass  --  and that you , sir , should be head of a government that imposes on them such restrictions ! OSBERT That movement , of course , was quite justified . My father and my cousin Clarence relieved us of that vulgar tyranny . My cousin stained the houses with beautiful colors  --  p. 79 THE FORESTER Only for those who could pay for them . OSBERT My father threw out cretins from public office  --  THE FORESTER And installed a lot of grafters . OSBERT He shortened the workers ' hours and paid them regular wages . THE FORESTER But made them still work at glass . OSBERT There 's no way of getting around that . Even before the Revolution , while I was still a prisoner in the Desert , I had had to accept the fact that a glass civilization was inevitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cells so brittle that any jar can crack them ? OSBERT Yes : our glass-making is rather old-fashioned . THE FORESTER This makes people very nervous , and yet they 're hardly alive . In the forest , we 're not nervous  --  though , of course , we have to be on our guard against the bears and the panthers . Those bears who used to be in uniform are now a degenerate stock and of course are extremely treacherous . But the beasts are at least alive , not like these half-dead people . The trees are alive and the thickets are alive . The animals we shoot are alive , and we nourish our lives from theirs . We do n't have to live on the vegetables that you glass people grow under glass . The very beams and planking of our houses are veined with the veinings of life . You have the advantage here of the old stone and wooden Palace . You do n't know how the other people live . p. 80 OSBERT Let me tell you I 've lived in a stone house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE FORESTER So did I for that matter . I was the black sheep of a stone-house family . The stone did n't crack , to be sure  --  but it did restrict my freedom . You ca n't live in such a coffin of a world . OSBERT Yes : I know what you mean . THE FORESTER I think we 're related through the Grimsons . OSBERT How ? THE FORESTER Henrietta Grimson  --  she married Guy Hunter . She wrote poetry , you know . OSBERT But not very good poetry . THE FORESTER Her death was tragic . OSBERT Yes . A knock at the back door . OSBERT Come in . THE PAGE Some very queer gentlemen to see you . OSBERT ( looks at his list ) . Mr. Schenck ? THE PAGE Yes : but very queer gentlemen with him . OSBERT Tell him to come by himself . THE FORESTER Please think about what I 've said . Osbert is silent . The Forester goes . The Page shows Schenck into the anteroom . He is the Emissary of Act I : spare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opens the door . p. 81 OSBERT Please come in . Schenck enters . They shake hands . OSBERT How do you do . Sit down . I was very much interested to hear about your experiments . I take a special interest in biology . What the world needs is better people . SCHENCK That 's what I 'm working on . OSBERT Really ? You did n't explain in your letter . SCHENCK I thought it would be better to see you . I do n't want it given publicity yet , and I wanted you to hear the news first  --  not only on account of your position , but because it was something you said that started me off on the work in the first place . OSBERT Something I said ? SCHENCK You would n't remember , but I saw you once years ago . It was under Mr. Rudolf 's government . I 'd been given a job serving notice on people  --  they were always serving notice then . I had to crack down on a family who were operating a paperweight factory independently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the moment and made a rebellious speech : you said that the work you did , you did for its own sake , and that the things you made would be alive , and that you would n't work for Mr. Rudolf . Of course , they could n't have that kind of talk then , and they sent you to the Great Desert . But I 'd never heard such defiance , and I could n't get it out of my head . p. 82 OSBERT You , too ! SCHENCK I was interested in biochemistry and , after I got a good job in the Glass Works , I worked at it on the side . When your father got to be Dictator , and things eased up a bit , I 'd saved enough money to drop my job and take a little house on the shore , where I was able to experiment with fish-eggs , and it was n't very long before I found that I could stimulate them artificially and hatch out almost any kind of fish . Then I began working with rats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the end of five or six years , I found that I could fertilize them artificially  --  not the way they do with cattle , but with spermatazoa that I synthesized myself . OSBERT You made synthetic spermatazoa ? SCHENCK Better than the rats could themselves , and I could turn out better rats . I had n't been able to find out yet how to control the pigmentation , so they were sometimes a little spotty , but otherwise my rats were superrats . They got so smart  --  I was specializing for brains  --  that I could n't keep them shut in their cages . They 'd pull out the nails and pick the locks and run away . Then come back and rob the house . So I thought I 'd try some other animal . A rat does n't give you much of a basis to work on  --  from the point of view of character , I mean . I did some work for a while with dogs , but the different breeds make things confusing , and monkeys was where I made the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but then , when I laid off size and concentrated on brains again , I found that one of my young gibbons was beginning to talk the local dialect , and I thought that it was not worth while to try to develop apes when human beings in certain ways were already so much further developed . I had only fair success at first . p. 83 OSBERT But how did you persuade the women to submit themselves to your experiments ? SCHENCK Oh , by that time it was all ectogenetic . The fishermen out there are poor , and the wives would let me take out one ovary for fifteen zukors or so . Well , as I say , I made slow progress at first . Human beings are more complex than most other animals  --  and , besides , when they do n't come out right , the results look a lot worse because you ca n't help comparing them with other human beings . I wo n't say that I did n't have some bad miscarriages : giantism , underdevelopment , too many or too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that did n't harden . But at last I got what I was after : a human being that 's both stronger and smarter . OSBERT I 'm truly astonished , Mr. Schenck . I 've had no idea that such results were possible . SCHENCK You people only concentrate on glass and finding serums for the desert diseases . If you would only train some bio-chemists , what a different kind of world we might make ! OSBERT Could you allow me to see some of your  --  creations ? SCHENCK I 've got two in the car outside . OSBERT Bring them in . SCHENCK I do n't want them seen yet by anybody except you . I 'm afraid they 'll attract attention  --  though I 'm afraid your page got a glimpse of them . p. 84 OSBERT Yes : I see . I 'll go out with you then . They rise . SCHENCK You 'll see that their coloring is n't all that it ought to be  --  I have n't got the hang of the pigment . Some of the brightest ones are albinos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They go out through the anteroom . Just as the door into the house is closing behind them , Tiralira and Trixie come into the anteroom . They are aging but still more or less elegantly dressed . Tiralira knocks at Osbert 's door : no answer . MR . TIRALIRA He does n't answer , but we might as well wait here till lunch  --  and escape having to talk to Queenie  --  a darling woman , but a dreadful bore . MR . TRIXIE He 's been awfully busy lately . I think he 's distinctly worried by the attacks in the conservative press . He 's been taking a firmer stand . But it must be embarrassing for him to have to deal with the scandals of his father 's government . MR . TIRALIRA He 's really more upset , I think , by Lucille 's staying away so long in Phaiecia . He 's beginning to be afraid that this time she 's not coming back . MR . TRIXIE I 'm sure that he 's really more comfortable living alone here in the Palace with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loves it .  --  Were you going to ask him about your modern museum ? p. 85 MR . TIRALIRA Yes : I wanted to get an appropriation to buy up some Periwinkos and other things . There 's a perfectly stunning nude that looks like the Central Power Plant !  --  I mean where you see all the pistons . MR . TRIXIE I wanted to talk with him , too , about saving the old city churches . It 's absurd that the government should encourage religion and then let the churches go to ruin . You know that lovely old transept at St. Kittywake-in-the-Bush is full of biri-biri birds ' nests , and that fragile Frigidarius chapel that is just beside the Power Plant has so many windows broken that the smoke comes through and chokes the congregation  --  such as there are of them left . Dr. Dish comes into the anteroom . He is venerable and well-dressed in black as if he occupied some distinguished post . DR . DISH It would be well to save the churches , yes . They are the records of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religion  --  the emotional wrought-up states that the ritual and trappings provoke . MR . TRIXIE Ah , you have n't the Faith , Doctor . If you had , you would n't speak so of our ritual ! DR . DISH I do not say that I am entirely devoid of faith , but we new Humanists do not admit that a decorous system of morals can be based on a supposed supernatural revelation . p. 86 MR . TRIXIE I do n't deny the value of Humanism , but it is useless without the faith in revelation . DR . DISH And I do not deny that Humanism may be supplemented by religion  --  if of not too expansive a kind . But one of the primary points that must be grasped is that Humanism is quite independent of religion and may dispense with it altogether . MR . TIRALIRA What is Humanism , then , old boy ? DR . DISH Humanism is a moral system which has recently reached us from America . MR . TIRALIRA Has Humanism anything in common with those other American doctrines that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Constitutional Government , letting everybody vote for the Dictator ? DR . DISH It has nothing in common with them . American Humanism is not democratic . It is , in fact , anti-democratic . We do n't trust the common people , and do n't want to do anything to benefit them because we do n't think they deserve it . Humanism is mainly intended for persons of superior academic standing . I have found that I have always been a Humanist ; for Humanism is not only opposed to democratic institutions : it is opposed to almost everything else . Its inflexible fortitude lies in its purely negative character . It is the conviction of the Humanist that virtue is exclusively a matter of refraining . Now , I knew that I had never been degraded by any of the turbulent passions . I had been refraining all my life . It was true that in my weaker moments , I had sometimes let my self-respect suffer by comparison with those irresponsible Bohemians whom the common man admires as poets , those reckless brutes he praises as heroes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under Humanist discipline , I have learned how to patronize all these , and my spirit is perfectly at peace . I have nobody now to look up to , and I therefore experience no envy . p. 87 MR . TRIXIE You will never know perfect peace till you have eaten the bread of the Sacrament ! MR . TIRALIRA It 's easy to eat the bread , old boy , but what I ca n't see for the life of me is how a fellow who used to joke as you did about the Seven Sacred Eggs of Saint Kittywake can swallow the Celestial Birth and the miraculous Resurrection of the Prophet . MR . TRIXIE To have faith one must make oneself humble . When the Sacred Eggs seem absurd to us , it is because we have been deceived by our own foolish pride of reason . When we are humble enough , we comprehend these mysteries . There are , alas , so few people today who have risen to this height of humility ! MR . TIRALIRA You mean " sunk to this depth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I never make fun of the sincere believer ; he has my entire respect . But for me it 's enough to cherish beautiful things . It 's enough for me to contribute my modicum of taste to the care of the Art Museum  --  to sit at home with my own few good pictures , with the delicious old furniture of the Megrims about me . I do n't want to have to contemplate the ever so painful story of the Prophet 's persecution and martyrdom  --  all the less if it should be true . They go on talking while Osbert and Schenck come back into the Dictator 's room . p. 88 OSBERT I 'm very much impressed , Mr. Schenck . What you 've shown me is perfectly amazing . SCHENCK Of course , they 're comparatively crude as yet , but I believe that in a few more years , with adequate personnel and equipment , I can turn out a human being that will make the present model obsolete . OSBERT Yes : they make one feel inferior in certain ways .  --  Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are . I never sent them to school  --  all they know is what I 've taught them . I 'd set them to work on problems , and they 'd carry things much further than I could . But you 'd find they could make good at anything . It 's just a question of training . OSBERT Of course . They share your own interests .  --  And they resemble you in other ways , too . You believe in slender people like yourself . SCHENCK That 's only sound engineering . A maximum of energy and cordination to a minimum of bulk and weight . Of course , they 're not so graceful-built as natural human beings , but if I could get a good anatomist to work on them , he 'd be able to correct that . OSBERT How old are they ? SCHENCK Ten to twelve . p. 89 OSBERT Really ? They seem mature . SCHENCK They are . I speed that up . OSBERT I believe I 'd like to see them a little less prosaic . SCHENCK I admit that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerous . You do n't dispute the value of my work ? OSBERT Oh , no : certainly not .  --  My dear Mr. Schenck , this whole experiment is undoubtedly enormously important and is going to make serious problems . I must take time to think about it . Come back in a week 's time . SCHENCK OK , sir . He goes out through the anteroom . Tiralina now knocks at Osbert 's door and Osbert opens it . MR . TIRALIRA Have you a minute , old boy ? I see you 're alone . There 's something I wanted to ask you . Osbert admits him . Trixie , left alone , goes into the door to the Palace . MR . TIRALIRA It 's about the modern museum . I 'm told that the whole thing could be done for not more than two million zukors . OSBERT ( firmly ) . Impossible , Tiralira , with thousands of people out of work . I 'll have to put some of them on relief , and I ca n't spare a piffer on museums . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know , and  --  OSBERT And then , the new outlay for defense . MR . TIRALIRA ( disappointed and miffed ) . I see . OSBERT Oh , by the way , Tiralira , I 'd like that old paperweight that the Megrims used to have . It was always a favorite of mine . Dana in the Golden Shower . MR . TIRALIRA It 's in the Museum now . It 's the property of the State . OSBERT The Dictator is the State . MR . TIRALIRA I do n't need to tell you , old boy , that this is only a limited dictatorship , and I am Curator of Fine Arts . Anything that 's connected with the arts has to have my approval . OSBERT The old Megrim furniture 's not in the Museum . You 've got it all in your own house . MR . TIRALIRA It 's too fragile to be exhibited . OSBERT I can always appoint another curator . Queenie enters , a broad pink ribbon in her hand . QUEENIE I always knew there was something lacking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Do n't you remember ? Your mother always had one . p. 91 OSBERT Oh , yes : thank you , my dear . She ties it with a big bow . The Page knocks at the door of the anteroom , and Osbert opens it . THE PAGE A lady to see you , Your Excellency . QUEENIE Oh , do send word you 're at lunch . OSBERT Who is it ? THE PAGE She says you know her . She says to say it 's Miss Emerald . Emerald , not waiting for permission , comes into the anteroom , looking even more fierce and determined than in the sand-sifters ' shack in Act I. She has with her a boy of twelve , with the military straightness of Emerald . OSBERT I 'm afraid that I 'll have to see her . You people go in to lunch  --  I 'll join you . QUEENIE Please do n't be too long , Berty . She and Tiralira go out . Osbert , boldly smiling , walks into the anteroom . OSBERT Well , Emerald , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three months . OSBERT When I last heard of you , you were in Leukopolis , the Leader of the Women 's Legion . EMERALD I 'm doing the same kind of work here . p. 92 OSBERT I did n't know we had a Women 's Legion . EMERALD I think there are a good many things that you do n't know about , Osbert . First of all , that you have a son . Adalbert , this is your father . Osbert and the boy are both embarrassed . OSBERT Why did you never tell me ? EMERALD I saw no reason to . I went abroad at the time of the Revolution . You got married ; I had n't known I was pregnant . I 'd got into trouble for lse majest under the government of that ruffian Rudolf , but I did n't want anything to do with the reign of that bounder Bimbo . I made myself a place in Leukopolis . The Phaiecians have energy and discipline , and I 've been worried when I 've looked over here and seen what difficulties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You must take a strong line with your malcontents . Adalbert is proud of his father , are n't you , Adalbert ? ADALBERT I sure am : I 've read everything about you . All your books of poetry . They read you a lot in Leukopolis . And I 've read everything that 's written about you . OSBERT You must n't believe all that stuff in the papers . ADALBERT I do n't believe the opposition papers . I do n't believe we 're unprepared for war . I know that you 're just biding your time to strike . p. 93 OSBERT You get that from the government papers . Do n't believe all you read in them either . EMERALD Do n't shake his faith in you , Osbert . ( To the boy ) Your father likes to pretend to be cynical . ( To Osbert ) He 's eager to take part in the next war . ADALBERT We 've got to show those Phaiecians that they ca n't put tick-tacks on our consul 's windows ! EMERALD Let me talk to you privately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adalbert . Adalbert goes into the reception room , where he takes a cap pistol out of his pocket and amuses himself by shooting at the objects in the room . EMERALD You must acknowledge him , Osbert  --  acknowledge him and have him succeed you . OSBERT An illegitimate son ? EMERALD You have n't any other children . Legitimatize him . Divorce Lucille . I can tell you that Lucille has been sleeping with everybody of any standing in Leukopolis , and you 're the laughing-stock of Phaiecia . OSBERT Marry you ? EMERALD You owe it to your dignity , and I sha n't make any demands on you . You never did satisfy me . And now I 'm a complete Amazon . p. 94 OSBERT I do n't want to fight the Phaiecians . I do n't want to make this into a war state . EMERALD You 'll have to sooner or later . The opposition 's getting stronger , but I 'm rallying the militant movement with the best of old Rudolf 's Battleaxes and a youth group that 's getting more and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OSBERT Any birds and bears and morons among you old Battleaxes ? EMERALD Do n't be silly : they wo n't take discipline . The Page knocks , and Osbert opens. @x Osbert 's sitting room in the Palace , furnished with the Megrim furniture , the clock with the allegory standing on the mantelpiece . Osbert , now six years older , is sitting in an armchair , fingering the Dana paperweight . Trixie is sitting opposite . OSBERT Well , what brings you out in this bombing ? MR . TRIXIE It 's poor old Tiralira . He 's been miserable since you fired him . An explosion and crash are heard . Trixie starts violently . MR . TRIXIE Oh , there they go again ! OSBERT I do n't even wince any more . I know that if I happen to get killed , I 'll have nothing more to worry about  --  and I think I 'm due for a stroke , anyway . I 've been having these dizzy fits . MR . TRIXIE I 'm sorry that you have n't our hope . OSBERT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which your Prophet descended ? The legend about his birth is as silly as the legend of Dana ( holding up the paperweight ) : that Zeus came down in a shower of gold to impregnate her with the hero Perseus . MR . TRIXIE That was an anticipation  --  a prophecy in the form of a fable that the Divine would send down to us a Savior. p. 96 OSBERT To me , this is simply a creation of beauty , a kind of clothing of a woman in splendor.  --  But what were you saying about Tiralira ? MR . TRIXIE He 's really in a pitiable state . He does n't get along with these creatures that all look like Engineer-Biologist Schenck , and they wo n't give him any kind of job . OSBERT Do you think that those creatures have souls ? MR . TRIXIE That 's a theological problem that has n't been settled yet .  --  But about Tiralira : he 's starving and he 's living in wretched lodgings . You took the best of his furniture away . OSBERT As you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't try to live up to your ethos . Tiralira was always a damned rascal . MR . TRIXIE Do you want to leave him to die ? OSBERT We 're all very likely to die .  --  I ca n't take him in because he gives me the creeps . I can send him a few rations . Do n't eat them all up your self . MR . TRIXIE You do me a cruel injustice . OSBERT ( wearily ) . I 'll see that you get some , too . He is seen giving an order on the house phone . Emerald comes striding in , in military uniform . p. 97 EMERALD Trixie , I see you 're not doing your bit . MR . TRIXIE I pray . EMERALD You 'd be better off praying in uniform . Of course you have n't got the guts for a soldier but you might make yourself useful at GHQ . MR . TRIXIE I 'm not sure I approve of this war . OSBERT Do n't tell that to the Head of the Women 's Legion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of that rubber-spined Fabius . If I had been , the war would have been won long ago ! But you sit here on your fat liberal ass and try to sabotage our effort ! OSBERT ( to Trixie ) . Go to the kitchen and they 'll give you something . MR . TRIXIE Thank you , Osbert . You do share our ethos in spite of what you say against it . OSBERT I 'm damned if I share your ethos . It 's an ethos that nobody could live up to . That 's the last resort of you worshippers , to say that we 're really one of you . MR . TRIXIE Well , in any case , thank you , Osbert . OSBERT Uh-huh  --  as people say nowadays .  --  Tell Tiralira that if I see him again and he calls me " old boy " just once more , I 'll be glad to let him die of starvation . Trixie goes out . p. 98 OSBERT ( smiling wanly ) . And as for my ass , Emerald , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cad to insult me on account of my sex  --  which I 'm doing my best to suppress . OSBERT It 's not true that I 'm sabotaging the war effort . Did you hear my speech the other day ? EMERALD It was drivel , it had no fire . OSBERT I 'm afraid that I have to agree with you . EMERALD You compromiser ! You coward ! OSBERT I at least had the courage not to marry you . EMERALD Courage not to marry me ! If you 'd been a real man , you would have married me , and this would have been a real nation ! OSBERT How is Adalbert doing with the Navy ? EMERALD He needs more ships , and of course we have n't got them . OSBERT There 's nothing for it now , I think , but to propose negotiations . EMERALD You mean to accept defeat , to back down before our enemies ? OSBERT After all , we attacked them first . EMERALD To prevent their attacking us ! p. 99 OSBERT Lucille says that that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . EMERALD Lucille is a double spy . If you had had the spirit of a bumble-bee , you 'd have sent her back to Phaiecia . Lucille comes in , very chic . LUCILLE With all our boasted technological progress , I ca n't find a decent electric toothbrush , and my old one is all worn out . Explosion and crash ; Queenie enters . EMERALD You 're worrying about your goddam toothbrush when civilization 's at stake . OSBERT What do you mean by civilization ? EMERALD Our wonderful country , of course  --  but not you , you poetasting milksop !  --  playing with your little paperweights ! QUEENIE And now you must all come to dinner . A picks it up and listens . OSBERT ( to the people in the room ) . We were bombed by mistake by our own people . QUEENIE Oh , was anybody hurt ? p. 100 OSBERT Two killed . A few injured . QUEENIE Oh ! She starts for the door , and Osbert follows . LUCILLE I suppose this means no dinner ! EMERALD Are n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at corpses . I would n't even go to see poor Count Klimny , who killed himself on my account . Emerald gives her a scornful look and follows the others out . EMERALD It was perfectly deliberate no doubt  --  they want to get rid of their idiot non-Dictator . OSBERT ( on his way to the door ) . I 'm still alive , my dear . EMERALD How long ? OSBERT " O Queen of air and darkness , I think ' t is truth you say , And I shall die to-morrow ; But you will die to-day . " Another explosion close at hand . Osbert falls to the floor , makes an attempt to get up but is help less . OSBERT ( indistinctly ) . I 'm half paralyzed . I ca n't get up . EMERALD Ha ! Queenie comes back and , seeing Osbert on the floor , rushes to him . p. 101 QUEENIE Osbert !
