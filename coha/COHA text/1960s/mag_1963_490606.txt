Notes and Comment IN the amplitude of time , we may find it possible to do without news , but we will never reconcile ourself to breakfast without newspapers . Our longing for the informational and ephemera word has led us , by desperate stages , to the compulsive reading of labels on bottles , boxes , and tins . Every morning , as the honey congeals on our neglected toast , we rummage hopefully through cupboard and refrigerator for something fit to read . A chaos of possibilities has revealed itself , with infinite suggestion , to our morning gaze , and our every perusal stirs memories . Once , from the rounded flank of a bottle , we learned that " BASS ALE has become a household word and is exported to the four corners of the globe , " and the intellectual effort required to visualize a globe with corners put us strongly in mind of the similar efforts demanded of us by David Lawrence in the dear dead days beyond recall . We chanced upon a canister labelled " White Rose Black Pepper , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our mental eye : With the publication of her second volume of lyrics , " White Rose , Black Pepper , " Felicity Crewe abundantly fulfills the rich promise ... But by far the most remarkable discovery of our matutinal foraging expeditions is the inscription " Reg . Penna . Dept . Agr. , " which we have found on every loaf of bread , every box of crackers , every container of macaroni , and every package of muffins in our larder . What is Pennsylvania that so many should seek the approval of her registry ? And why the Department of Agriculture rather than that of , say , Health ? What strange power is vested in this little-known body of agronomists ? We seem to detect the breath of scandal : The government 's surprise witness , a grocer named Felix Culpa , testified that on September 23rd of last year two men entered his store and pushed him into a back room . They were wearing long trench coats ? " like in the movies , " Culpa said  --  hut he was able to see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneath the coats . Their hats , which were plaid and had earflaps , were pulled Iow . One of the men struck him across the face with a large ball of binder twine and snarled , " Where d' ya buy your bread ? " In his summation , the prosecuting attorney spoke of a " reign of terror stalking the comestibles market , " and urged a verdict that would " destroy forever the sinister abbreviation that makes every grocer tremble -- Reg . Penna . Dept . Agr . " When no newspapers exist , it is necessary to invent them . A reader can not , after all , live by bread alone . Small Speedster iv old friend of ours , Herbert 0 . Fisher , a test pilot who has spent most of his mature life up in the air , phoned us the other day to ask if we 'd care to join him in feeling out a Lockheed JetStar . " You 'll love this little dandy , " said Mr. Fisher . " It 's sixty feet long , give or take a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close to the rear of the fuselage , as in the Caravelle jet planes , and it can make six hundred miles an hour . " We informed Mr. Fisher that we were n't in a Lindbergh mond , whereupon he informed us that Lindbergh 's Spirit of St. Louis was only twenty-seven feet eight inches long ; that its speed when it was fully loaded was a mere hundred and twenty miles an hour ; and that , furthermore , we were chicken . " That 's a canardl " we retorted ambiguously , and the next thing we knew we were headed for Idlewild . In transit , Mr. Fisher , who functions as chief of the Aviation Development Division of the Port of New York Authority whenever they can get him down to sea level , chatted about his career in the wild blue yonder , which started thirty-three years ago in Indianapolis and has taken him all over the world . Between 1937 and 1952 , he was the Curtiss-Wright Corporation 's chief test pilot , and , all told , he has had fourteen thousand hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jennies to big-league jets . " You know , I test-flew two thousand four hundred and ninety-eight P-40s for Curtiss-Wright , " he said . " In the ChinaBurma-India Theatre , during the Second World War , test-flew ninety-eight missions in C-46 transports over the Hump , between India and China , for the Air Transport Command , and fifty combat missions in P-40s , but I was still a civilian  --  on loan , as a technical representative , from Curtiss-Wright . Oh , I had the assimilated rank of full colonel , so that I would rate good treatment in case of capture , but I was free of all military guff . What I 'm proudest of is that I was awarded the Air Medal . Also , I was the first man to reverse all four propellers on a multi-engine transport simultaneously in flight . " He reflected fora while , and then observed , " I guess I do n't look much like most people 's idea of a test pilot . " He does n't . Standing five feet ten , he weighs in at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an amiable alderman than an eagle . Now fifty-three , he has a thinning thatch of white hair , and has come to take a kind of bemused attitude toward his work and himself . " I 'm getting a little too far along in years to give a plane the falling leaves , the barIA rolls , and the rest of it , " he told us . " But I 'm still with it on an evaluation flight , during which you figure just what a plane will do in the circumstances for which it was designed . " When we reached the JetStar , in front of Idlewild 's Hangar 2 , we were met by Dan Disher , the captain of the aircraft ; Quentin H. Burden , the copilot ; Don Bailey , the flight engineer ; and John E. Powers , a pilot who is currently in the sales department of Lockheed . " The JetStar is just the ticket , if you have a million and a half dollars to invest , " Mr. Powers told us . " As of now , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been corporations , but Alfred G. Vanderbilt has one for his own use . The plane seats ten or twelve and has a crew of two or three , and it costs six hundred and fifty dollars an hour to operate . " The JetStar , which had graceful lines and was painted white with blue trim , looked handsome , but it also looked quite small . We mentioned that to Mr. Fisher , and lie said , " Remember Lindbergh . " He then proposed that we do a series of touch-and-goes at the Suffolk Air Force Base , on the east end of the island . " What is this touch-and-go ? " we inquired nervously . " I want to get the feel of the plane , so I 've arranged with the base to let us touch down on the runway and take off immediately , " Mr. Fisher explained . When we got into the plane , we found it neatly arranged , with six seats in the cabin and four more in a lounge . The cockpit , with two hundred and twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commodious , but off we went , and in the course of our travels we learned from the flight engineer that this little mechanism can travel at least two thousand miles without refuelling , that it can get up to forty thousand feet , that it is equipped with all the paraphernalia of a large jet , and that it is used by Lockheed for business purposes , like transporting its missile executives . " Think like an executive , " Mr. Fisher advised us . At Suffolk , the plane went up and down at a great rate three times while we did our best to think like an executive . ? INCIDENTAL INTELLIGENCE : A recent issue of the Paris magazine Joan de France refers to a current Broadway success as " Qui A Peur des Loops de Virginie ? " Hortus Club NO doubt there 's a club for almost everything in New York , and we 're indebted to Thomas H. Everett , Assistant . Director ( Horticulture ) and Senior Curator of . Education at the Botanical Garden , for guiding us to one we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group of plant enthusiasts who meet every month and who have just celebrated their tenth corporate anniversary with a dinner at the Hotel Lexington , which we attended under the wing of Mr. Everett . " We 're not necessarily botanists . We 're pleatsonrn , " Mr. Everett said . ss we gained the Florentine Room , where drinks were being served to forty or fifty men and women . He introduced us to the club 's perpetual president , Mr. Harold Epstein , an urbane man with a mustache , who carries on an advertising business in Long Island City and raises orchids , camellias , and Japanese plants , among other things , in a couple of greenhouses at his home , in Larchmont . " We 've invited ladies tonight , but membership is limited to twenty-five men , " Mr. Epstein told us . " They par annual dues of twenty-five dollars and are required to attend at least half our meetings . Summers , these take the form of outdoor excursions . " President Epstein introduced us to Mr. James S. Clark , lately retired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another academic-horticultural Clark  --  Robert , Senior Curator of the Liberty Hyde Bailey Hortorium of Cornell University  --  and then to Mr. James G. Esson , who is the father of a hybrid holly known as the James G. Essen and is the possessor of a Scotch accent uncontaminated by hybridization . " I came here from Scotland in 1926 to join Samuel Untermyer 's greenhouse staff at Grey-stone , his place in Yonkers , " Mr. Esson said " What an argumentative man he was ! He enjoyed arguing about his pansies , his tulips , his orchids , and everything else . I raised the James G. Esson at his place . The Holly Society of America was good enough to call it the finest aquifolium it had ever seen . " " A well-merited encomium , " Mr. Everett said . " Its berries , in the female form , are beyond compare . " Mr. Everett then introduced us to another of the evening 's heroes  --  Mr. A. B. Graf , who is the vice-president of the Julius Roehrs Company , a ninetyfour-year-old , **33;2575;TOOLONG exotic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " Exotica , " a " Pictorial Cyclopedia of Exotic Plants , " which contains some twelve thousand illustrations , many in color , of specimens from all over the world . " I 've been working on ' Exotica ' for fifteen years , " said Mr. Graf . " I 've just got out a third edition , ' Exotica 3 . ' Taxonomy changes constantly , you know , and this contains more than twenty-three hundred corrections and changes in nomenclature . " We next met Mr. Victor Greiff , secretary-treasurer of the Hortus , who retired five years ago as an engineer in the city 's Department of Public Works . " I 'm an incurable gardener , " he said . " I carry on on a sandbar in the Atlantic Ocean . Rockaway . Plants will grow in almost anything , provided they have air , moisture , and nutriment , such as soluble chemicals . I have cacti growing in water , and they like it . I 'm an old hand at chemicals . " " I have n't seen you since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to us , and who should it he but Mr. Rodney Wilcox Jones , president of the Jones Knitting Corporation and past president of the American Orchid Society , whom , to be sure , we had buttonholed seventeen years ago , when he was about to set off for Brazil to gather rare orchid plants for his nine greenhouses in New Rochelle ! He advised us that the Society , in which he is still a. power , has eight thousand members  --  fifty-five hundred more than when we saw him last  --  and that he had been instrumental in getting an orchid on a Brazilian stamp in 194-6 . " People in the textile business generally die young , " he said . " I 'd never he alive today if it had n't been for orchids . Did you know that thirty thousand species of orchid are registered at the Arnold Arboretum , the world 's headquarters for orchid information ? " Cocktails over , we crossed the corridor to the New England Room , to sit down at a dinner that was served on a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was followed by many a hortatory horticultural oration , including one by Miss Elizabeth Hall , the Botanical Garden 's Sarah Gildersleeve Fife Research Librarian . " I 've gone through some of our books and booklets , " she said , " and I 've found that fourteen members of Hortus wrote almost twenty-four thotr.and pages of them . " ? Warm VEHUDT 14IENumN gives about a hundred and fifty concerts a year , in some twenty countries  --  a schedule that calls for a Fantastic amount of hopping from place to place , in the course of which Mr. Men uhin , a - student of many subjects besides the violin , keeps his eyes and ears open . The other day , having just returned from a month 's tour of Russia , during which he played concerts in Moscow , Leningrad , Kiev , Minsk , Lvov , Kishinev , and Odessa , he was hrimming over with notions about Russian musicians , whose sunny natures and secure way of life he expatiated on for our benefit . " Russian musicians are the warmest , most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagine , " he said . " Russians are , of course , traditionally hospitable , but I think there are other reasons for the musicians ' warmth . There 's the fact , for example , that they spend most of their lives together , from the time they are little children in music school , and that , outside music , their lives offer very few chances for adventure , diversion , excitement , or personal aggrandizement . They achieve a certain position by the time they 're twenty-five or thirty , arid , once graded , they more or less stay put in a given category  --  first rank , second rank , third rank , with each rank carrying its own privileges and fees . In short , they have the advantages of a lifelong intimacy and a lifelong dedication to their art , and are spared the hazards to friendship and art of our fierce forms of competition . " Himself a prodigy his debut , in San Francisco in 1923 , when he was seven , made him famous overnight  --  Mr. Menuhin was especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where four hundred children , ranging in age from seven to eighteen , arc enrolled . " There are many such schools in Russia , " he said . " Think of what it would mean in this country for a gifted child to be able to study for eleven straight years , without a moment 's distraction by hit family , by TV , and so on A violinist particularly needs to he alone , because a violin makes a far from pretty sound while one is mastering it ; in a crowded New York apartment house the sound of a child torturing a violin becomes unendurable . Naturally , there arc drawbacks to the Russian system . In music , as in every other field of endeavor , the Russians aim for a very , very high standard , to he achieved as quickly as possible by a handful of the most gifted , while the majority of the population is left far behind . The discrepancy in Russia between the peaks of skill and the average of skill is enormous . To speak only of violinists , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people . Today , because of the increase in the musical repertory through the research of musicologists and the composition of so much excellent contemporary music , the violinist must have a broader approach to his art . In Russia , violinists are only beginning to discover this broader approach . Still , there are indications that Russian musical life is becoming more sophisticated . The success of the Moscow Chamber Orchestra , led by Rudolf Barshai , is a good sign . For the first time , Russia has developed a worthy chamber group . In the past , there have been only the two extremes of brilliant virtuosos and massive orchestras . Russian musicians are learning much from the mechanical infusion of music performed outside the country ; one sees them practically swathed in tape from their recording machines . " Music is as much an integral part of the life of Russian cities , Mr. Menuhin told us , as hospitals , schools , and dogcatchers are of city life here . " But this , too , points up the problem of the big gap between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Once one leaves Moscow and Leningrad behind , there 's a tremendous drop in quality . A city the size of , say , Butte , Montana , may have more and better music than Butte has , but it 's all of a pattern , and the shape of the country 's culture is like that of a pyramid having Moscow at the apex , with very little of high quality left below the apex . In this country , we have a remarkable level of orchestral playing in many cities ; St. Louis , Dallas , Austin , Seattle , and the rest do n't have to surrender their best musicians to New York . " Of all the cities Menuhin visited on his recent trip , Odessa was his favorite . " For one thing , my mother had known the town as a girl , " he said . " For another , it 's the town that has produced more violinists than any other . The audience at my concert was made up mostly of Jewish people  --  people who give their sons violins as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they knew more about the violin than any other audience I 've played to . Besides , I had a personal recollection of Odessa . The city is on the Black Sea , near Rumania . I visited it long ago , with my father . We stopped in at a gypsy camp , and I was fascinated by the gypsy music  --  by the absolutely natural way the music spoke , by the intensity of it , by the way it imitated bird song and other natural sounds . My father said , ' Why , those are Jewish melodies I used to sing as a child ! ' He was right , but they were actually , in their origin , gypsy songs . In Odessa , you see , the underprivileged urban Jewish fiddler and the underprivileged wandering gypsy fiddler both hit on the same means of personal expression  --  a means light and mobile , which they could carry with them wherever they might have to go . " OVERHEARD in the Bird Cage , at Lord &; Taylor , one bouffant coiffure to another : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She does n't really like any of her friends . " Out Tiger , In Hare ONE evening last week , we joined General and Mme. Kuo , who operate the Lichee Tree restaurant , down on Eighth Street , in the Village , at a banquet organized to celebrate the Chinese New Year . On our way to the table reserved for us , we were intercepted by the General ( Nationalist Chinese Army , retired ) , who used to he a diplomatic representative of Nationalist China in Rome , and who speaks English with both a Chinese and an Italian accent . He proposed that we have an aphitif with him in the Lichee Tree bar , so he could explain some of the workings of the Chinese calendar to us . Over a pony of a concoction called Five Fragrances , which is full of herbs , alcohol , and authority , the General informed us that the Chi-nese calendar was devised by China 's first emperor , Wang Ti , four thou-sand six hundred and sixty years ago . " He was basing his calculation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people know when it was time to plow , seed , harvest , and so on , " the General continued . " Each year in Wang Ti 's calendar has three hundred and fifty-four days , so we keep running short . To compensate for this , we have seven times of leap year in every nineteen-year period . In a leap year , we repeat a month . In the old days , the kings liked to name the years after themselves , but this was no good , because when a king was overthrown , his successor would also throw his name out of the calendar . It was as if there was a Year of Tru-man and then Eisenhower came in and said there was no such year . So the farmers made up names for years in terms familiar to them , and now we have Years of the Mouse , the Bull , the Tiger , the Hare , the Dragon , the Ser-pent , the Horse , the Sheep , the 141on-key , the Rooster , the Dog , and the Pig . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and preparations for celebrating it are begun at the time of the first full moon of the winter solstice . The day itself falls at the time of the second new moon of the winter solstice . In preparing for it , we clean the house , repent our sins of the past year , and make resolutions . Other things are also done . Dragon dances are held to chase away evil spirits , the faces of the Buddhas in the temples are washed , and firecrackers are set off . " We thanked the General and moved along to the main dining room , where we were handed a menu that included Curry Crab in Cellophane , Lobster Roll , Perfection Charm , Chicken Bong Bong , Winter Melon Soup , Dragon Boat Lobster , Imperial Duck , Harmony Shrimp , Yong Chow Rice , and Jade Paradise . It was a formidable feast , but delicious , and between courses we were entertained  --  about a hundred guests were on hand  --  with an Oriental fashion show , in which Mme. Averill Tong , a celebrated Chinese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shy , modelled dresses in styles dating from 200 B.C. Mme. Kit ? functioned as mistress of ceremonies , and she was as informative as the General . " In the wonderful days of the past , in the China I knew , the New Year was celebrated for twenty-five days , " she said " The God of the Kitchen was supposed to visit higher deities at this time to make his report , and it was the practice to rub honey on his lips , so that his report would be favorable . He came home again on New Year 's Day . " As Mine . Tong and her troupe danced and glided about , Mme. Kuo , who changed costumes almost as often as the performers , told several tales of famous Chinese beauties . We remember one about Empress Young Kwei Fei , who was the favorite wife of Emperor Tong Ming Wang , and who lived only for the joy of living . " Her beauty bewitched the Emperor , and inspired poets , artists , and composers , " said Mme. Kuo . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I see the floating clouds , I think of her garment ; when I see a flower , I think of her countenance . ' Like many beauties who indulge excessively in selfishness , she met with a disastrous end . " A cheerier tale was one about Hwa Moo Lan , who was born during the Tong Dynasty ( 618-906 A.D. ) . " She typified Chinese filial piety , learning the art of weaving from her mother and the art of swordsmanship from her father , " Mme. Ku() said . " When she was a teen-ager , the kingdom was beset by Tartar invasions . Her aged father was about to be conscripted into the Army . Now , Hwa Moo Lan had no brothers , so she disguised herself as a man and went to battle in her father 's plate . " At this point , one of Mme. Tong 's girls , Medy Tong , who was Queen of the New Year 's Celebration , did a sword dance , waving a couple of tin blades about with dexterity . Also very dexterous betimes was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at one point wheeled in a table bearing an Imperial Duck and proceeded to carve it exquisitely , using no tool but a cleaver . As the evening drew to a close , with all hands stuffed and happy , Mine . Kilo wound up her stint as mistress of ceremonies with these remarks : " A final word on the New Year . It is a time to clean our house , a time to cleanse our souls , a time to repay our debts , a time to pay respect to our ancestors and friends , a time to have only goodness in our hearts toward all members of the human race . " We said amen to that . Setup ONE icy afternoon last week , we stepped into the vestibule of an apartment house in the East Seventies to get out of the cold , and a moment later a short member of the snowsuitand-mittens set toddled in from the street and , without giving us as much as a glance , approached the tiers of mailboxes in the lobby . After struggling out of his mittens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms better , he took a key that was hanging from a string around his neck , stood on tiptoe , unlocked a letter box , and opened its door . Then he reached inside the box and carefully withdrew a thermos bottle . He unscrewed the cap , pulled out the cork , and tilted the thermos to his lips , and the smell of hot cocoa filled the vestibule . He drank for quite a long time , seemingly with little enthusiasm and possibly out of a sense of duty . Then he corked the thermos , screwed the top hack on , returned the thermos to its repository , slammed the box shut , zipped up his jacket , put on his mittens , and waddled forth again into the world .
