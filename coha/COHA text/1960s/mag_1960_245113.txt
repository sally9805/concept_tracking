" Till the conversion of the Jews " denotes a vague and distant future. * <P> <P> But an important Protestant voice last week suggested that the time might be closer at hand than it seems . The voice : the Rev. Dr. H. Conrad Hoyer of Chicago , who is soon to be associate secretary of the National Council of Churches ' Division of Home Missions . Dr. Hoyer was speaking in Atlantic City last week at the annual meeting of the National Lutheran Council ( representing eight church bodies and more than 5,000,000 U.S. churchgoers ) . <P> Reported Hoyer : at a " theological consultation " of " the church and Judaism " held last year by delegates from Lutheran and other Protestant bodies , it was decided that the time is " right " for an intensive effort toward the " evangelization of the Jews . " This , he said , is a Christian duty-as " instruments of the Holy Spir't , we must persistently evangelize . " If the laborers in this vineyard are few , " this is true only because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people in our mission thinking . " <P> On a trip to Israel last summer , said Lutheran Hoyer , " we pointed out that as far as the Christian Church is concerned , we have no alternative but to bring the Gospel to the Jewish people and to all others ; to neglect them or to leave them out is to discriminate against them . We were pleased to note that , when thus presented , this position was graciously accepted in every case . " <P> <P> *As in Andrew Marvell 's ( 1621-78 ) " To His Coy Mistress " : Had we but world enough , and time , This coyness , Lady , were no crime . . . And you should if you please refuse Till the conversion of the Jews .
