Notes and Comment UNTIL the other day , we had never been quite sure whether the United Nations knew how to handle absolutely everything or not , but then , in an elevator in the building that houses its Information Centre , on Q Street , in Washington , we concluded that we ought to stop shilly-shallying and put our trust in it wholeheartedly when we read an inscription it had cornposed , with sense and grace , and had placed on a wall of the elevator for all to read : " DO NOT RE ANXIOUS IF THIS ELEVATOR DOES NOT SEEM TO MOVE , PARTICULARLY DOWNWARD . IT SUBSIDES VERY SILENTLY AND SLOWLY , RUT IT GETS THERE . " Weight Symposium THE Metropolitan Life Insurance Company does n't like people to be fat . For many years , it has been warning middle-aged people of both sexes that obesity was markedly shortening their lives ; now it 's trying to get the attention of young fat people as well , since it appears that this prosperous , self-indulgent , and sedentary century is producing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dramatize the hazards of obesity , at any age from twenty-five on , Metropolitan Life last week held what it called a " human-weight symposium " at its offices , down on Madison Square . We were among the symposiasts , weighing in on the nearest subway scales at a hundred and forty-three pounds . Our Metropolitan hosts were glad to see us looking so thin ; for our height and frame , our weight is what they have recently decided to deem " desirable , " as opposed to " average , " which is the range of weights you see on most charts . After an exhaustive study , Metropolitan Life has reached the conclusion that " desirable " weight is as much as twenty pounds under " average " weight , which is to say that a person who has been comforting himself with the thought that he was of a good , healthy weight is in fact very much overweight and had better start thinning down at once . Curiously enough , our hosts  --  Mr. Cecil J. North , president of Metropolitan Life ; Dr. George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Dr. William P. Shepard , medical director ; Mr. Edward A. Lrw , chief actuary and statistician ; and Mr. Charles G. Dougherty , vice-president in charge of public relations  --  had n't a skinny man among them . In our informal categories , they ranged from North ( portly ) , through Shepard ( well fed ) , to Dougherty ( fi eshy ) . Dr. Shepard started things off by stating that there is no doubt whatever that excess weight means decreased longevity as well as much unnecessary illness . Half of all American men in their thirties , he said , have been found to be at least ten per cent above " desirable " weight , and about a fourth of them have been found to be twenty per cent above it . Among women of comparable age , the margin is somewhat smaller . Mr. Lew put in that Metropolitan 's " desirable " weight is based on an individual 's trunk length , wrist and ankle size , chest breadth , and hip width . " We 've divided our desirable weights into small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . " Fred Astaire , for example , is a person with a small male frame ; a halfback on the New York Giants football team is a person with a large male frame . Lily Pons has a small female frame ; a Wagnerian soprano has a large female frame . " Mr. Lew shuffled some papers impressively , sucked in his stomach , and said , " A man forty-five years old , of medium frame , standing five feet eight inches high and weighing a hundred and fifty pounds  --  a most desirable weight  --  can expect to live a year and a half longer than a similir man weighing a hundred and seventy pounds , and can expect to outlive a two-hundred-pound man by four years . Underweight , my friends , is a passport to long life . " Dr. Wheatley picked up the ball and ran a few yards . " ' We Americans eat too much , have too many automobiles and other energy-savers , and spend too much of our leisure time sitting down , watching television and the like . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart disease , diabetes , arteriosclerosis , and hypertension . Now we want to warn the young folks  --  es-/7k pecially the ' average ' - weight young husband whose loving wife takes pride in fattening him up . " After a few more grim warnings and the showing of a short film about a Mr. and Mrs. Chubby , who for years let themselves go in a revolting fashion but finally pulled themselves together and fought their way hack down to " desirable , " we were all invited to have lunch in the executives ' dining room . To our astonishment , the menu featured cold egg fortugais , cream of broccoli soup aux croutons , steamed finnan haddie with drawn butter , broiled Salisbury steak , creamed whipped potatoes , buttered carrots and peas , cherry pie , coffee ice cream , caramel-tapioca pudding , and cheese and crackers . We 'd never seen so many naked calories in our life , but , not to embarrass our hosts , we ate well .

" Airy Architect TIKE Frank Lloyd Wright , though a I not posthumously , Marcel Breuer , a modern architect who has been practicing in Manhattan for the past thirteen years , and before that practiced in Germany , Switzerland , France , England , and Massachusetts , has just completed Iris first huilding in New York  --  Shuster Hall , a **42;1864;TOOLONG combination **27;1908;TOOLONG building and library , with space for two hundred and fifty thousand books , at Hunter College 's Bronx branch . We missed the recent dedicatory exercises , at which Mayor Wagner said " We stand today upon the threshold of another era in education " and Mr. Breuer called attention to the library 's " four hyperbolic-paraboloid shells , forming six inverted umbrellas , which brace each other , " but we have since called on the architect at his office , on East Fifty-seventh Street , and learned that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are as economical as they are fantastic . " The curvature of the form takes care of the stresses , so that relatively little concrete is required , " he said . " The roof is of thin shell construction , and to support it only six columns were needed in a space a hundred and eighty by a hundred and twenty feet . This gives a very airy impression . Hyperbolic-paraboloid roofs are relatively new ; there are some in South America , but not on this scale . The section of the Hall that contains the classrooms and administrative offices is connected with the library by an entrance foyer in what I call a hinuclear system  --  two connected nuclei . This section has a big interior courtyard , in which I 've planted a maple tree ; I hope it will grow vigorously . The southern and eastern exposures of the Hall , which are glass , are shaded from the sun by screens made out of one-foot lengths of flue tiling  --  a kind of architectural air-conditioning . The building has no regular air-conditioning , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel so much at home with these flues that they stick their books in them when they go strolling in the sun outside . " We asked Mr. B. to tell us something about himself , and he said he was born in 1902 in Pecs , Hungary , and at eighteen , after graduating from the local school , went to Vienna to register at the Art Academy . " I wanted to he a painter and sculptor , " he said , " but when I got to the Academy , a big classical building , and saw a copy of a sentimental statue of a sitting Beethoven , I was so disgusted that I turned around and left . I 'd been brought up in a provincial town  --  it was occupied by the Serbs for two years after the First World . War  --  and I 'd never been exposed to revolutionary art , but this was too much for me . I suppose I 'd be more tolerant today . " Mr. Breuer was tolerant enough then to go back a few days later , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappointed in the place ; bearded professors went around from seat to seat and made routine comments , and I found my fellow-students a terrifically conceited lot of self-styled geniuses " ? he packed up and went to the Bauhaus , in Weimar , which had been started by Walter Gropius the year before . He stayed there eight years  --  four as a student , four as a teacher . " It emphasized the unity between arts and crafts and architecture , " he said , " and involved real work  --  not a hundred per cent genius from morning till evening . Genius onl ) some days , let us say . " The sitting Beethoven 's non-admirer started turning out tubular-steel furniture in 1925 , and three years later , well heeled with royalties from it , he set up as an architect in Berlin , where he built villas and shops and did remodelling . " The German financial crisis had begun , " he said , " and in 1931 I closed shop and headed for the Mediterranean  --  Spain and Morocco . " He subsequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Basel , and in 1933 , in Paris , took the two first prizes in an international aluminum competition with some aluminum furniture of his construction . " I sold the designs for it to various European manufacturers , " he said , " but Hitler started his armament program around this time , aluminum became scarce , and the furniture was never produced . " England appeared on the Breuer itinerary in 1935 , when he joined F. R. S. Yorke , a London architect , in a partnership that lasted two years . " We 'd known about each other through our work and through friends , but when we met , we could talk to each other only in schoolboy French , " he said . " One of the things we did was the London Theatre Studio . Only recently , Peter Ustinov , my newest client  --  I 'm building a house for him in Montereux  --  told me that he had studied there , sitting in a Breuer tubular-steel chair . " Mr. Breuer went on to say that since coming to America , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and practiced architecture at Cambridge  --  he has had an international practice . We asked what this consisted of , apart from the Ustinov and Hunter College jobs , and he mentioned the UNESCO Building in Paris , on which he collaborated with a French architect and an Italian engineer ; the American Embassy in The Hague ; a department store in Rotterdam ; an office building near Amsterdam ; and an urban center  --  shops , theatres , supermarket , and so forth  --  in Caracas . Domestically , Breuer buildings have risen in North Dakota , North Carolina , California , and Minnesota , in Baltimore and Washington , and in Princeton  --  a hundred and seven housing units for the Institute of Advanced Study . " I 've done a convent in North Dakota for Benedictine nuns , " Mr. Breuer said , " and I am finishing up the last of three buildings , a church , for St. John 's University , which is a Benedictine institution in Collegeville , Minnesota . The church has a choir of three hundred and will be one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chapels , it seats twenty-eight hundred . I 've designed it with no interior columns .

Location AWORKING mother of our ac-quaintance who likes to keep tabs on her eight-year-old boy when she 's nut at borne asked him always to leave a note giving his destinarion when he went out . A recent complying missive read : I 'll be almost anywhere . Since rely yours , MIKE Tireless WE intend to keep on informing our readers of the latest developments in the field of automation until the creepy technological point is reached at which a machine is devised to inform our readers of the latest developments in the field of automation and our poor old brains and beat-up Remington are put on the shelf . On the agenda today is a prodigious toy called Tutor , which its makers , the Western Design Division of U. S. Industries , Inc. , define as an electromechanical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , encourages him in his desire to master the material , tests him on what he has learned , congratulates him if his answers are right , detects and corrects any wrong answers he may give , cornpiles an account of his method of reasoning , and notes improvements , if any , in this method . Tutor is not only brainy but agreeably small , resembling in size and shape a cigarette vending machine . On its face are an eight-byeleven-inch viewing screen and a panel of fort ) numbered push buttons ; on tap within are up to ten thousand separate microfilmed or motion-picture images . According to Norman A. Crowder , manager of Western Design 's Training Systems Department and a co-holder of the Tutor patent , the trim little contraption was devised as the result of an inspiration that came to him when , as a research psychologist in the Air Force 's Air Research and Development Command , he drew up tests to measure the proficiency of personnel who had been trained to work with intricate electronic equipment . " I soon found there was precious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us when we stopped in to visit Tutor and Crowder at the U.S.I. offices , on Park Avenue . " Students were being trained by teachers who used the conventional lecture system , which is thoroughly inadequate when it comes to communicating complex material on a large scale . I realized that the success of a learning process could be insured by the invention of a machine that would present information to the individual student and allow him to proceed at his own rate of speed and comprehension . " What , we asked , of the merely human teachers of this world ? Were they to be utterly routed by armies of softly humming Tutors ? " Not at all , " said Crowder . " Tutor presents material step by step , and is intended to teach people how to use equipment or solve the sort of technical problem about which sequentially dependent questions can he asked . History , literature , and the humanities do n't lend themselves readily to the automated process . In any event , we 're interested not in replacing teachers already in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Learning is an individual matter , and ideally every student should have his own teacher ; Tutor will help to realize this ideal . The teaching theor back of Tutor calls for constant two-way communication between the student and the machine . Having picked a subject you wish to study , you sit down in front of the machine and push buttons that , in accordance with a prearranged code , will project the images of a given teaching sequence onto the screen . Each image contains a basic item of information about the subject and a multiple-choice question to test your response to what you have just seen and read . You register your answer to the question by entering the image number corresponding to your choice on the push-button panel . If your answer is correct , the next image will bear a printed message of congratulation , another item of information , and another test . If your answer is wrong , the new image will contain material designed to correct the error in your reasoning and will send you hack for a second try at the original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on tape the sequence of the images you view and the amount of time you spend on each image . " Though Tutor will never supplant the human teacher , it has certain basic psychological advantages over him , or her . For one thing , Crowder pointed out , the student need never feel ashamed in its presence . " People hate to seem inferior , " he said . " Many shy students hesitate to stand up in class and hazard questions or answers that may make them look foolish . The Tutor-student relationship is confidential and reassuring ; Tutor strengthens a student 's reasoning powers by the exercise of infinite tact and patience . It never grows tired or annoyed , never makes fun of anyone or hurries anyone along for the sake of the rest of the group . It is inhumanly knowledgeable but also inhumanly kind .

Miss Lillie THE best tonic we know is a visit with Beatrice Lillie , and on hearing that she was in town for a couple of TV appearances we arranged to drop in on a rehearsal , where we found our ageless , tireless , and supremely funny heroine surrounded by a conventional clutter of TV characters  --  a young director , some still younger assistant directors , a couple of actors , a pink-checked pianist , and a heavyset young man who was identified for us as John Philip , Miss Lillie 's manager . Miss Lillie , dressed in ankle-high tan suede storm hoots , a green wool suit , a double string of pearls , and a Russian-commissar-like hat , was looking her usual uncannily girlish self and was plainly up to her usual mischief , for we arrived in the midst of a gust of laughter , and when we asked one of the actors what the occasion for the laughter was , he shrugged and ducked his head toward Miss Lillie . " Do n't ask me what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's just that she makes you feel good . I wish they 'd let her run the whole damn industry . " The director called for a run-through of an old Noel Coward skit and song . " This is for Pontiac , " a TV functionary whispered to us . " She taped part of a show for Bell Telephone last night . " " ' My dear , I brought you these , ' " one of the young actors said to Miss Lillie . " ' Rubies ! Such c r u e 1 stoned ' " cried Miss Lillie , kicking up her heels . " Oh ! " she then exclaimed , grimacing and kicking up her heels a second time . " That 's fur the other show , is n't it ? Awfully sorry . I keep getting them mixed up . " Apparently not in the least put out , the director gave Miss Lillie a loving smile . " ' What is it that 's making you so unhappy ? ' " an actor asked . " ' Life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a seagoing yacht into the famous " Weary of It All . " Presently , the rehearsal ended , and Miss Lillie came over and said hello . She reported that she was feeling very Et except for the ravages of our local steam heat . " It gets me down , you know , " she said , striking her forehead with a clenched fist . " I ca n't breathe . Day and night , I 'm absolutely frying . I was frying at two-thirty this morning , taping the Bell show . To make matters worse , I was wearing a beautiful new cerise taffeta gown , and the piano in the studio turned out to have been freshly painted , and I got paint all over my gown .. The chap in charge of the studio said , ' Do n't worry , lady . Wash n as soon as you get home . ' Wash it , indeed ! I had to cut the bloody paint out with a scissors ! " Miss Lillie summoned her manager , informed him that she was in desperate need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and us to go shopping with her . " That 's a very attractive hat you have on , " Mr. Philip said , helping Miss Lillie into a mink coat so big that it made her seem a child playing at being grown up . " That hat is you . " " I want another one just like it , maybe several just like it , and in all colors , " Miss Lillie said , a fiercely acquisitive gleam in her eye . " I love to go shopping , " she told us , setting out , at a smart clip , for Fifth Avenue . " I 'm going to try a shop that I 'm always peering into ; I do n't remember the name , I just remember it has big windows .
