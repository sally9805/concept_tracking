A chub-faced little man-one who likes to kick off his shoes and relax when he sits down to talk-went to Washington last week . He was John Goodwin Tower , 35 , Republican winner of the Texas Senate seat long held by Democrat Lyndon Johnson ( TIME , June 2 ) . And for all his 5 ft. 5 in .. Tower loomed high in G.O.P. eyes . <P> More than 100 Republican leaders turned out at the airport for a whooping welcome . Arizona 's Senator Barry Goldwater pumped his hand . Republican National Committee Chairman Thruston Morton slapped his back . Senate Republican Leader Everett Dirksen hugged him and breathed : " Good to see you ! " <P> Good , to Republicans , it surely seemed . For not only had Jack Tower toppled Johnson 's interim successor , Democrat William Blakley , to become Texas ' first G.O.P. Senator since Reconstruction days , but he was sworn to battle the Demo cratic New Frontier straight down the line . " In general . I 'm completely opposed to the New Frontier , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program . I am against federal aid to education , medical care for the aged , higher taxes , foreign aid both economic and military , and wasteful domestic spending . " <P> As if that were not enough , Tower had a word about the Cuban mess : " I am dead set against the tractors-for-prisoners exchange with Cuba . Instead , we should completely blockade Cuba . The time may be imminent when - we should militarily occupy Cuba . And if the Organization of American States will not support us , we should act unilaterally . " <P> Winning the Cities . With such ideas , Texan Tower had cracked a Democratic fiefdom . A year ago , he was an obscure assistant professor of political science who dabbled in Republican politics but had never won elective office . He plucked the nomination for last November 's Senate race largely because brighter-name Republicans wrote it off as a lost cause . But he surprised everybody by capturing a remarkable 41% of the vote in the race against Lyndon Johnson . Because Johnson won election both as Senator and Vice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have come had Johnson been confident enough to run only for the vice-presidency . <P> Then the small but zealous G.O.P. organization really went to work . Republicans concentrated on winning the two groups that they usually lose : city folk and Negroes . They rang doorbells on virtually every block in Houston , and they made 90,000 phone calls in San Antonio ( pop . 500,000 ) . Result : Tower swept the cities , got a good chunk of the Negro vote , won by a margin of 10,000 . <P> Losing the Liberals . Reverberations of the upset shook both parties . Democratic conservatives shuddered , and wondered how long they could preserve their one-party system in the Deep South . Tower 's good friend , Barry Goldwater , fully expected the presidential endorsement of the big Texas delegation in ' 64 . For the nearer future , Texas Republicans were planning to put up candidates for Congressman , mayor and councilman in cities where they had never before dared to run in the 20th century .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
