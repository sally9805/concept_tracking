Whether in devastated wartime London or an overgrown jungle throbbing to the heart of the matter , the landscape of Graham Greene 's novels is inexorably arid and sere . Yet in the midst of a life that is rather worse than purgatory and scarcely better than hell , his characters are touched by a vagrant grace . The Comedians , for which he wrote a script based on his novel , is Greeneland all over again , this time in Haiti . Off a ship and into the damned , doomed country walk three anonyms : Brown , Jones and Smith . <P> Beneath their drab masques are three highly colored personae . Smith ( Paul Ford ) is a potato-faced professional vegetarian from the Midwest who plans to convert the natives to a diet of nut-burgers and Yeastrol . Jones ( Alec Guinness ) is a breezy , sleazy gun smuggler , all winks and leers , forever dreaming of deals . Brown ( Richard Burton ) , in Haiti to reclaim his late mother 's hotel , is a lapsed Catholic , a cynic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ target for temptation , as substantially embodied in a Latin American ambassador 's wife ( Elizabeth Taylor ) . She waits for Burton in her car on a highway-evidently the most private place in Haiti-where they hungrily make love . <P> Greene 's fictional Haiti , which seems not very far removed from the real one , is a Black Power station brutally run by " Papa Doc " Duvalier and his swaggering Gestapo , the Tontonx Maconte . Eventually , Ford realizes that in order to survive in Haiti he would have to become a vegetable himself ; revolted by the wretched beggars and savage beatings , he escapes to the safety of the U.S. Burton envies the American 's innocence , but he has been affected and infected by Ford 's passion to obliterate evil . Thus , when Guinness flees the police and appeals for help , Burton can not refuse . " I like you , " he says , surprised- " God knows why . " Next morning the Tontons offer Burton $2,000 and freedom to reveal the whereabouts of his colleague . The weary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It used to be 30 pieces of silver . " Once he has refused to play Judas , the only role open to him is Jesus . <P> Running two hours and 40 minutes , The Comedians has everything but economy , and Director Peter Glenville has tarried with a story that might have been twice as good at half the length . Unlike the novel , in which Greene 's obsessive concern with man kind 's spiritual underworld is subdued , his scenario seems as overtly moralistic as a passion play . <P> The Haitian government would not allow the moviemakers in . When he learned the locale was to be Dahomey , Africa , the Duvalier representative protested formally . Yet French Photographer Henri Decae 's location shots offer a remarkable re-creation of a land where images of voodoo gods and the Virgin Mary are worshiped at the same rituals . The cast of supporting villains and victims-led by Peter Ustinov-is uniformly excellent . As a fading beauty with a German accent , Taylor is reasonably effective , but Burton , playing an exhausted anti-hero in the same style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cold , seems to have stepped from the pages of the novel .
