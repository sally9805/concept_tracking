CLEM ANDERSON ( 627 pp. ) -R . V. Cassill-Simon &; Schusfer ( $5.95 ) . <P> It was probably inevitable that Dylan Thomas , like Scott Fitzgerald , would sooner or later become a mark for the novelist , and equally inevitable that the fiction of his life would be beggared by the facts . Clem Anderson is a thinly disguised Midwestern incarnation of Thomas , and as the novel opens , he is 37 , newly successful , about to marry a blonde Hollywood starlet , and already suffering the physical penalties of literary lionization- " the bloaty softness of his face , the bat's-flesh bags under his eyes .

Novelist Cassill parrots John Malcolm Brinnin 's gruesome description of Dylan Thomas ' similar death in an oxygen tent , concluding with the moment in which a fellow poet clasped " the cold , yellowing feet " of the corpse " in a gesture either of pleading or of farewell . " <P> One trouble with the book is that Clem 's credentials as a writer are questionable . To suggest his hero 's talent , Novelist Cassill quotes a quantity of Anderson prose and verse , all of it unimpressive . What makes the novel fascinating , nevertheless , is its curiously romantic assertion of modern literature 's most popular legend-that the world is a conspiracy intent on destroying the poet by pulling him from " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other times , poets died simply of starvation or of drink or in barroom brawls or at the hands of their mistresses ' husbands .
