If there had been any doubt about it before , there was no longer : the Montreal Canadiens are the greatest team in hockey history . Last week , completing the job of skating and shooting the Toronto Maple Leafs off the ice , Les Canadiens won the Stanley Cup play-offs in four straight games . The scores : 4-2 , 2-1 , 5-2 , 4-0 . It was the fifth consecutive Stanley Cup for Montreal , a feat never equaled . <P> Montreal is a team of stars and of depth . When it started its championship streak five years ago , the big name was that of Maurice Richard . This year Richard , at 38 , is plainly near retirement . But his kid brother , Henri , 24 , has become one of hockey 's top forwards-and Montreal has a half-dozen other of the N.H.L. 's brighter stars . <P> But Montreal 's real strength lies less in its headlinemakers than in its top-to-bottom power . Said a rival club official last week : " They 've got so much talent they can keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a year . Then when they get in the game , they beat you . "
