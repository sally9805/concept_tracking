Cuban Trade <P> Sir : <P> Castro 's offer to trade 1,000 prisoners for 500 bulldozers is pure public blackmail . Yet I sense no wave of righteous indignation in the press or on the air . . . only foul submission . Mrs. Roosevelt and the Government of the U.S. make me sick . <P> <P> FRED FINCH Spokane <P> Sir : <P> <P> Inasmuch as Khrushchev and his Caribbean pal are agreed on their intention to bury us , 500 bulldozers will certainly come in handy . <P> <P> W. H. KNOWLES Pompano Beach , Fla . <P> <P> Sir : <P> If 500 farm tractors will ransom 1,200 Cubans from their homeland , maybe a nuclear submarine or two will redeem the Americans held in Red Chinese jails , and 100 B-58s will persuade the East Germans to release 10,000 of their malcontents . <P> <P> ROBERTA F. GLEITER <P> Topeka , Kans . <P> <P> Sir : <P> <P> As an American citizen , a Korean veteran , and one who is damned sick of dollar diplomacy , I strongly object to the Tractors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so soft that we will resort to the payment of blackmail to a psychopathic , power-hungry dictator to avoid our responsibilities ? There is no doubt of our obligation to the members of the unsuccessful invasion force , since they were apparently ill advised by our intelligence groups ; but far more satisfactory methods of obtaining their freedom are close at hand . <P> I suggest that Tractors for Freedom be diverted to deserving South American countries-for who can deny the economic value of such a movement-and substituting a " Troops Instead of Tractors " committee for Dr. Castro . No doubt some critics would be aghast , but would n't it be wonderful to see our national pride glow again ? <P> <P> F. G. MERSER <P> Natick , Mass . <P> <P> The Freedom Ride <P> Sir : <P> All men are entitled to equal opportunity and equal public facilities , all unsegregated , both morally and under the law . Nevertheless , the Southern segregationists are citizens of the U.S. , too , and , more important , are also human beings , with the same feelings and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will change their misguided beliefs . <P> Antagonism , the method of the Freedom Riders , only causes more bad feeling and bloodshed , and in the end only makes the road to complete freedom more rocky . In this way , those Freedom Riders are not bringing freedom about , at all , but are preventing it and subverting its accession . <P> <P> STEVEN E. HENIGSON Los Angeles <P> Sir : <P> Speaking of CORE 's Freedom Riders May 26 , you say : " They were , in fact , hunting for trouble-and last week in Alabama they found more of it than they wanted . " In actual fact , CORE 's Freedom Riders were not hunting for trouble but for service-and they found it in Virginia , North Carolina , South Carolina and Georgia . <P> Our purpose was not to demonstrate that segregation still exists in the South , but rather to end that segregation which we all know exists in interstate travel . We shall go on-calmly and with dignity , with understanding in our hearts , but also with firmness . We can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1% a year . The time to act for all Americans to achieve an America of dignity for all is now . <P> <P> MARVIN RICH <P> Community Relations Director CORE New York City <P> Sir :
