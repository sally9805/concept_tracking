Is it safe to be a boss ? Are executives more subject than their subordinates to early and fatal heart attacks ? Medical men , bemused by the number of young executives who made the obituary columns , used to think the danger was real . Then they realized that ditchdiggers seldom make the obit pages , and they decided to take a more careful statistical look at executives to see how the bosses fared . E. I. du Pont de Nemours &; Co. , with battalions of executives and divisions of manual workers , was an ideal place for the study . <P> Now , in the A.M.A. Journal , Du Pont Statistician Sidney Pell and Physician C. Anthony D'Alonzo report that presidents , vice presidents and plant managers have an annual heart-attack rate of only 2.2 per 1,000 while the manual workers ' rate is 3.2 Du Pont 's clerical workers have a rate of 4.0 per 1,000 . Among those listed as clerical workers , evidently , are many who have failed of promotion to executive status and are suffering the stress of frustration . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's life , the researchers conclude . " Stress can not be measured or described by the external circumstances with which a man must contend , but rather by his reaction to these circumstances . One man 's stress may be another man 's pleasure . "
