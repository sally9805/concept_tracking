FOREIGN RELATIONS <P> Chairman William Fulbright of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee confided to a friend last week that he had not talked privately with President Johnson since last October . Said the Senator : " I regret that he has no more interest in my views than he has . " Fulbright maintains that his decision last month to hold extensive public hearings on Viet Nam reflected no " personal animosity toward the President " but was aimed only at resolving " a much more serious , much more dangerous " conflict than the Administration will acknowledge . In recent weeks he has unmistakably emerged as the leader of congressional opposition to the Administration 's policy in Viet Nam . <P> " For God 's sake , " says Fulbright , " this is becoming a major war ! I assume that this is still a democracy , that the Senate has a role to play in foreign affairs . The hearings are a part of that role . " He adds : " The easy way is to go along , to keep quiet . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <P> Last week it was Fulbright 's turn to shoot . Most top Administration officials were either in Honolulu or Saigon , and thus , in his committee 's third week of sessions devoted primarily to the war , Fulbright had to make do with Retired General James Gavin and ex-Diplomat George Kennan , neither of whom has served in any official capacity for sev eral years . Both eagerly echoed Ful bright 's apprehensions about Viet Nam . <P> Blind Spot . Bland persistence is the hallmark of the Arkansas Democrat , who was once denounced by Harry Truman as " that overeducated Oxford s.o.b . " But though onetime Rhodes Scholar Fulbright , 60 , has long been described as an enigma , the trait that has made him a Senate storm center for two decades is not hard to define . <P> Put simply , it is an emotional and intel lectual reluctance to believe that Communism is a monolithic doctrine of belligerence based on a fanatical dream of world domination . <P> The blind spot has been manifested repeatedly throughout Fulbright 's career . In his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Communism a " powerful prejudice , " declared that " the Russian experiment in socialism is scarcely more radical under modern conditions than the Declaration of Independence was in the days of George III . " In his 1964 " Old Myths and New Realities " speech , delivered to a nearly empty Senate chamber , Fulbright urged a more pliant policy toward Red China . As for U.S. intervention in the Dominican Republic , the Senator condemned Washington 's " exaggerated estimates of Communist influence . " <P> A Notable Silence . Despite all his pleas for tolerance of repressive regimes abroad , Fulbright has never voted for a federal civil rights bill and has remained notably silent on the Negro 's drive for full citizenship . His public indifference to the race issue has not hurt him in Arkansas , which still tends toward white supremacy . Moreover , most Arkansans seem genuinely proud of Fulbright 's prominence and , they assume , power .
