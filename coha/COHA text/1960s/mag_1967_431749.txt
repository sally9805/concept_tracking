 | Life in a " Dead " Sea -- Great Salt Lake LIFE ON OTHER PLANETS ? Scientists have pondered the question for ages . Most of us find it hard to conceive of life as we know it in such hostile environments : searingly hot or profoundly cold ; with atmospheres lacking oxygen , showered by deadly radiation , or laden with noxious vapors and poisonous chemicals . Yet life , we know , can exist ? and multiply at times in incredible profusion ? in the saturated brine of Great Salt Lake . Last summer I studied and photographed these remarkable organisms , which somehow have learned to thrive in seemingly deadly water , eight times saltier than the sea , thirty times saltier than most body fluids . Behind me and on both sides shimmered an endless expanse of salt , showing no sign whatever of life , plant or animal . Before me sparkled a lake in which no fish swam . One could imagine few places , on this planet or any other , less hospitable to organic processes , more damaging to delicate cells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blinding whiteness , and crunching salt were Salt Lake City businessman Earl Pace , his pretty blond wife Beverly , and their two sons , Rand , 14 , and Ron , 10 ( below ) . A lifelong resident here , Earl is intimately familiar with Great Salt Lake ? its coves , inlets , and islands . First we scouted his lake from the air . " Shorelines of old Bonneville , " Earl shouted above the plane 's roar , as we passed terracelike striations high on a mountainside. 2.  | By " Bonneville " he was not referring to a car or a speedway but to a gigantic body of water that 50,000 years ago covered much of western Utah and parts of Idaho and Nevada . In area comparable to present-day Lake Michigan , the waters of ancient Bonneville reached depths of more than 1,000 feet . Then , when the last age of glaciers waned and its ice tongues retreated northward , weather in this part of the world became hotter and drier . Lake Bonneville shrank below the level of its outlet . Streams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offset evaporation . The lake grew saltier and saltier . Today the largest remnant of that once mighty inland sea is known as Great Salt Lake . Only a twentieth the size of the original and now nowhere deeper than 50 feet , it is one of the world 's wonders ? so salty that no swimmer can possibly sink in it . Pilot Ed Dreier banked the plane and we headed northwest . We were looking for a " bloom " ? a patch of rose-hued water caused periodically but unpredictably by the sudden mass multiplication of bizarre organisms that dwell not only in Great Salt Lake but also in warm , salty waters elsewhere in the world . Such organisms belie the very name of the Near East 's Dead Sea , for example , whose waters are even saltier than Salt Lake 's . Storm-lashed Brine No Place for Boating The gray-blue , 30-by-70-mile sheet of water spreading out below us appeared lifeless indeed . To the east , at the foot of the majestic Wasatch Range , from which Brigham Young and his stalwart followers in 1847 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " lay fair Salt Lake City . Along the lake 's south shore sprawled a checkerboard of dike-enclosed salt pans , backed up by the smoking chimneys of a great copper refinery , and beyond them the mineral-rich Oquirrh Mountains . Oddly , there were no sails on the lake , no craft of any sort . Earl , a sailing enthusiast , told me why . For one thing , he said , sudden storms are a constant threat ; without warning , a mirror surface may be whipped into a fury of breaking swells . " Not only dangerous but miserable to be caught in ? your boat white and weighted with salt , your clothes and hair coated with crystals , your eyes stinging from the spray , your motor more than likely dead from an ignition short . " Then , too , much of the lake is shallow , offering few places for convenient launching and landing . Great Salt Lake has nothing to offer the angler . Most of its islands are arid and desolate , some with shores encrusted forbiddingly with salt . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it as Gunnison , about eight miles offshore in the lake 's northwest quadrant , and inhabited only by terns , gulls , and pelicans . Bays and shallows shimmered in delicate shades of pale pink to deep rose ? " blooms , " unmistakably . Ed eased down to about 200 feet , then slowly circled . Comprising less than 170 acres , the island was starkly bare except for scrubby bushes here and there and a central crest of rock heaps and hummocks . Its entire shore was white with glistening salt . I regretted that our plane was not a helicopter so that we could land and wade out into the tinted shallows to appraise the strange color there . We circled once more , then headed back to our base . The Pace family helped me arrange a return trip to the intriguing island a few days later . We all set out at dawn in Earl 's 3/4-ton truck . Loaded on the back was a rented Penguin , a vehicle  | designed for duck hunting and marshland travel , with a Fiberglas body and wheels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amphibian would float when necessary , yet not bog down in the squashy salt flats . We parked the truck near where the Southern Pacific tracks approach the lake from the west , lifted down our versatile craft , and set out across an expanse of hot , blinding , halfflooded salt barrens . Whenever the mire slowed us , the boys and I would hop out and push ; when the wheels lost traction in deeper water , we would wade alongside to guide . The tepid brine felt pleasant on my legs . It was almost midday when we sighted the salt beaches of Gunnison Island . The whiteness of the shoreline was dazzling , and hardened hummocks of salt in the offshore shallows looked like ice floes in an arctic sea . Flocks of gulls and pelicans wheeled overhead ; some of the pelicans had chosen to nest on this isolated island , carrying fish from distant fresh-water lakes and marshes to feed their young . The water was still as marvelously pink as I had seen it from the air . My aim was to take samples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a laboratory I had improvised at my Salt Lake City motel . At a score of locations I dipped up vials of the pink brine . But when I held them up against the sky , I could see nothing whatever floating or suspended in the liquid . I recalled a talk with John Samuelson , chief chemist at the Morton Salt Company works . 10 miles west of Salt Lake City . " Several types of salt-resistant algae and an unknown number of bacteria live in these brines , " he had said . " In summer they sometimes proliferate at a furious rate , tinting the lake orange , red , or green . But individually most are visible only under a microscope . " Lake 's Brine Preserves Dead Birds Reassured , I packed up my samples and joined the Pace family on a hike around the island . Rocks and pebbles along the shore were cemented together by the crystalline residue of brine spray . Earl and Rand struggled to break off a piece of this hard white pavement , and it took some doing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly that of concrete . Representing the mineral content of the lake , it was almost pure sodium chloride ? common salt . Down the beach a way we came upon the remains of a pelican and then a gull , both apparently having died of natural causes . Washed up on shore , their carcasses lay perfectly mummified by the salt , each feather a marvel of crystalline design . Who knows how many days or years they had been there , eyes staring sightlessly at the sky ? I asked Earl to demonstrate the lake 's " nosink " character . He waded out into the pink water up to his waist , then stretched out as if on a sofa . Head high , arms and legs above the surface , he floated like a cork ( page 255 ) . In the glaring sun the temperature stood at 100 ? F. ; a minute after stepping ashore Earl was dry ? wearing a talclike coating of white crystals . Aside from smarting eyes , this sticky , gritty aftermath is the only uncomfortable part of swimming in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ northern reaches , cut off by the Southern Pacific dike ( preceding pages ) , the salinity soars to as much as 28 percent , in contrast to 18 to 24 percent in southern and eastern waters . But even there the swimmer can not sink , a fact that visitors delight in proving for themselves . Late that night , when I was back in town , my microscope instantly revealed ? as John Samuelson had predicted the secret of the pink water . Under the lens swam myriad single-celled , potato-shaped algae known to botanists as Dunaliella salina ( page 259 , top ) . Each reddish-orange cell sculled through the water by means of two long hairlike whips growing from one end . Other , even smaller @# species , Dunaliella viridis ( page 258 , bottom ) and Chlamydomonas , were bright green and similarly propelled by whiskery flagella . Still another green variety , called Aplanotheca sometimes Coccochloris , was encased in transparent jelly of its own making . Smallest of all were the bacteria , vagu pink and revealed only as shimmering d and rods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million could have perch on the point of a sharp needle . Salt-hardy Life Draws on the Sun The question persisted : How could these algae and bacteria survive , much less flourish , in a medium salty enough to kill almost every other form of life ? Our knowledge here is scant . We may only conclude that somehow , during the course of evolution , nature provided these curious forms with means either for preventing penetration of the salt or for keeping it from accumulating in toxic amounts . But most crucial to the survival of these remarkable creatures is the capacity of the algae to draw on the sun for energy . Possessing the magic energy-trapping ingredient . chlorophyll , they are able to unite simple carbon dioxide with water to form starch . @#  | sugar , and protein . Without this process of photosynthesis , there would be no life at all , for it produces the basic foodstuffs on which all animals , including man , depend. * Among the earth 's many thousands of animal species , only a tiny shrimp and one genus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Like the algae and bacteria , which belong to the plant kingdom , they have their heyday during the summer months . Best known for its eggs , the brine shrimp ( Artemia salina ) is a feathery , semitransparent crustacean which at times almost chokes shore waters ( pages 256-7 ) . During July or August dip up a glassful of water , and chances are that in it you will see several , even scores , of these tiny creatures . Or watch gulls sitting on the lake , nipping down with swift beaks for a meal of brine shrimp . Mature female shrimp develop an underpouch of eggs , each no larger than a grain of finest sand . Those released in spring and summer soon hatch , but eggs laid in September or October remain dormant over the winter . Wind and currents concentrate them mainly on the southwest shores , where they accumulate at the waterline in siltlike windrows.  | Commercial collectors scout the shoreline in places to locate the densest and most accessible depos:s Then crews in trucks with wide-tread tires cross salt flats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bags . Great Salt Lake brine-shrimp eggs find world market as a source of live food for tropical fishes Properly dried , they remain viable almost indefinitely Some years ago I gave away my aquariums , tropi , fish , and pet sea horses when I moved from New I to Washington . Four years later , while rummagi : through a drawer , I came across a bottle of brim shrimp eggs , label faded but contents intact . Were the eggs still alive ? I sprinkled some into beaker of sea water , and within two days there was another crop of swimming shrimp larvae , brought to life as if by magic after a four-year sleep . A tough outer shell and the fine knack of remaining dormant , like the wound spring of a stopped clock . suggest how this remarkable suspension of life may take place . As to why , one need only consider the grinding adversity imposed by seasonal extremes Worked upon by searing sun in autumn , ice and snos in winter , the beached eggs are successively baked . frozen , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rains and mountain runoff temporarily , reduce salinity near the shore , a crack appears in the leathery outer shell of each quickened egg , and a single larva emerges . It swims off in an immediate and urgent quest for food ? providentially supplied by the lake 's algae and bacteria , just beginning to burgeon It is true that other organisms ? amoebae , ciliate. diatoms , and the like ? inhabit waters of Great Salt Lake , but only where rain and inflow have a diluting effect . They can not be regarded as truly indigenous . for they can not survive in the saturated brine that harbors the tiny shrimp and the lake 's only other animal inhabitants , flies of the genus Ephydra. @#  | My first encounter with the flies occurred not far from where the railroad causeway spans the lake , here 31 miles across . The , each was typically salt white , but ahead lay patch blackened as if by coal dust . As I approached , a low murmur told what I was seeing ? an almost solid blanket of tiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then moved en masse along the beach , finally to settle again on the salt . I crept close enough to observe that some were mating , some depositing eggs , and others licking algae from the salt crystals . In the nearby surf I found scores of fly wrigglers , each a little larger than its mosquito counterpart , apparently feeding on algae and bacteria . These would soon metamorphose into brown pupae , eventually into adult flies . In summer , Ephydra flies may blacken miles of shoreline ( pages 260-61 ) . When disturbed , they simply take evasive flight , then resettle . Never did a single fly alight on my skin , or even approach me in curiosity . Strange Species Thrive in Harsh Worlds One objective of my summer 's work was to collect live cultures of micro-organisms for shipment to my research colleagues of the Department of Biological Sciences at Fordham University in New York City . There we are studying biochemical and life-cycle details of salt-resistant microbes . By August my collection was complete , except for fresh samples of Dunaliella @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I drove 120 miles to a remote corner of the lake , where on an earlier aerial reconnaissance I had spotted reddish water . A prevailing wind had pushed the discoloration close inshore , where the water was now a virtual pink soup . I filled several vials , and through a microscope perched on the hood of my car , I saw an incredibly dense population of vermilion algae . Here were thousands of the curious Dunaliella cells , pigments gleaming , flagella lashing . The brine under my microscope was at true saturation ; sodium chloride was recrystallizing as fast as it was being drawn into solution . Here was proof that this species could thrive in the absolute maximum of saltiness , and compelling evidence that adversity may exist only in the eye of the observer . Many another little-known plant and animal on our planet has adapted to conditions similarly harsh . We do not often see these hardy creatures , for they live mainly in a microscopic world . One group , for example , actually " eats " carbolic acid ; others metabolize iron , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some species thrive without oxygen ; some flourish in the scalding waters of hot springs ; others on the slick ice of glaciers . Cave dwellers , including some vertebrates , live perpetually in a total blackout . And miles below the surface of the sea live scores of abyssal wonders , under pressures of as much as 16,000 pounds per square inch . Who can define the potential of creative forces in the universe ? If life has been able to evolve and adapt to such bizarre earthly habitats , why not in even harsher and weirder environments ? say , perhaps , on some distant planet ? 263
