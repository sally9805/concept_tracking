ICE HOCKEY <P> At 5 ft. 10 in. and 195 lbs. , the Chicago Black Hawks ' Bobby Hull has been called the " perfect muscular mesomorph . " He is the National Hockey League 's Most Valuable Player , its fastest skater ( upward of 23 m.p.h. ) and hardest shooter ( his lefthanded slap shot rockets toward the net at 118 m.p.h . ) . Goalies complain that getting in the way of a Bobby Hull shot is " like being slugged with a sledge hammer , " and practically everybody agrees with Montreal 's Claude Provost that Hull is " the strongest guy in hockey . " He even looks mean when he smiles , because he is missing his three front teeth . <P> The truth is that Bobby Hull used to be a good-natured fellow who would n't hurt a flea . But people were taking advantage of him . Things came to a head last year , when Bobby picked up only 32 min. in penalties and won the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy for sportsmanship-although he was hooked , held , tripped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injuries . Healthy , Hull scored 32 goals in his first 35 games ; hobbled , he scored only seven goals the rest of the season , lost the scoring title to Teammate Stan Mikita . The Black Hawks wound up third , and Coach Billy Reay angrily accused Bobby of playing " pamby " hockey . <P> By last week a new Bobby Hull was sporting a 15-stitch gash on his forehead - souvenir of a brawl with New York Defenseman Jim Neilson . He already had spent 49 min. in the penalty box , and the Chicago Black Hawks , who have never won an N.H.L. championship , were leading the league by 1 games over Montreal . " Something was bound to blow , " exulted Coach Reay . " Bobby had to do something to protect himself . " <P> At the rate Hull is going , what needs protection most is the N.H.L. record book . With the aid of a specially curved stick designed by Stan Mikita , Bobby has developed his shooting skills to the point that he can make a puck do practically anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a knuckleball in baseball , or dip suddenly about 6 in. just before it reaches the net . <P> Last week against fourth-place Toronto , Hull sent a 35-footer whistling past Goalie Terry Sawchuck for his 32nd goal in 34 games , as the Black Hawks won , 5-3 . That gave him a 13-point lead over Detroit 's Frank Ullman in the scoring race-and , with 36 games still to play , a clear shot at the N.H.L. record of 50 goals in one season , which Hull shares with Montreal 's Maurice Richard and Boom Boom Geoffrion.
