txt Top U.S. executives who recently launched a businessmen 's counterpart to the Government 's Peace Corps are having trouble getting their vehicle off the pad . David Rockefeller , president of Chase Manhattan Bank here , last fall proposed a " managerial task force for iree enterprise . " His idea became the International Executive Service Corps. formed officially May 26 as a private , non-profit group that would provide expert management volunteer , to help struggling smaller companies overseas . This week , as the Executive Service Corps moves into its first headquarters on New York 's Fifth Avenue , it faces two embarrassing situations : First , despite the Corps ' determination to remain independent of the State Department , its initial money is largely coining from Uncle Sam . Second , its recruiters are finding that good executives are responding reluctantly to the call to spread the free enterprise gospel overseas . The financial discomfort may be temporary . But , at least until now , the Government 's Agency for International Development is footing most Corps bills . AID provided $100. - 000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " entertain proposals " to turn over $1 million in the first three years of the Corps ' operations . By contrast , private business donations so far total only about $50.000 . Paying for the Corps Eventually , the Corps hopes to pay its own way , partly through increased business contributions and partly through fees paid by foreign companies using the volunteers ' services . These fees will vary in different countries and , in some instances . will be paid by development banks . Frank Pace , Jr .. chairman of the executive committee of the Corps and former chairman of General Dynamics Corp .. maintains the level of private donations is " not disappointing . " He adds that no major effort has yet been made to obtain contributions . Personnel problems are still numerous . For example , no one has been found to serve as full-time president and chief executive of the Corps at a still  --  undetermined salary . Also undiscovered yet are five vice presidents . But the main problem is finding overseas volunteers . At first , the Corps said it hoped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the end of the group 's first year . And it expected 1.000 within three years . Now it 's evident the Corps ' sights are being lowered somewhat . " I ca n't tell how many people we 'll have . " says Mr. Pace . " If after a year we have 10 to 20 situations functioning . it would be excellent . " And officials are talking in terms of 100 volunteers  --  instead of 1,000 ? within three years . Many Called , Few Chosen There 's no lack of applications for the foreign assignments . More than 2.500 have poured into the Corps , including 11 from women executives . But after weeding out what one Corps official terms " crank letters , management consultants seeking fees and wives trying to get their retired husbands out of the house . " the group had only about 650 applications worth considering . And this list is rapidly dwindling as health , language skills and motivations of the applicants are investigated . One headache is that most applicants are older men ; the largest category is 55 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for more young , middle-management men . " What we need are fewer retired executive vice presidents of multi-million dollar paper companies and more foremen who could manage a saw unill , " says Mr. Pace . But he complains that most U.S. companies solicited for potential recruits respond : " Do n't call me . We 're management-short . " To date only three volunteers have been selected . One is Omer C. Lansford. 58 , who had planned to retire at the end of next year as the New York regional manager of American Oil Co . He 's headed for Panama to help four small companies , including a brewery , with cost control and other problems . It has n't been decided yet how much Mr. Lansford and others who follow him will be paid . Mr. Lansford is giving up a five-figure salary to join the Corps . One official close to the Corps organization says volunteers will receive transportation , medical , insurance and cost-of-living expenses . And officials are thinking of paying them a salary .
