The last of France 's spring strikes-that of the state-owned television industry-ended last week , or so Prime Minister Couve de Murville proclaimed to the National Assembly . But the 14 million Frenchmen who own TV sets could not really tell for sure . Paris ' Huntley and Brinkley-Pierre Dumayet and Pierre Desgraupes-as well as all of the other news regulars , remained off the air . Filling in for the eighth straight week were sketchy , scab-produced newscasts and a veritable festival of test patterns , canned variety shows and film antiques . <P> The official government euphemism was that programming was to be kept " light " to " put the French in a vacation spirit . " The fact , however , was that 114 newsmen and producers of the O.R.T.F. ( Office de Radio et Tlvision Franais ) were on a paid holiday until September pending what Couve called " a profound reorganization . " Their wages had been raised 13% , but the TV strike issue had been government censorship , not money . That complaint was still unresolved . <P> Dusty Grind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the regime of Charles de Gaulle , censorship has been particularly tight and unyielding . A few hours after the student riots erupted , for example , newscasts on O.R.T.F. 's two TV channels casually observed that the troublemakers had returned to their books and all was safe and snug in the land . Then , as turmoil mounted , TV newsmen prepared a two-hour report on undergraduate unrest , but minutes before it was to be aired , the government suppressed it . <P> Even under normal circumstances , French TV is hardly much livelier than the test pattern . Save for an occasional penetrating documentary or a good movie , programming is a dusty grind of westerns , inane quiz shows , and U.S. imports , such as Les Incorruptibles ( The Untouchables ) and Mission : Impossible . <P> News programs are devoted interminably to coverage of Cabinet meetings or scenes of officials dedicating schools and swimming pools . The International Herald Tribune described them as " the special kind of news in which the United States is alternately in the hands of race rioters or drum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a sinking currency and constant tea breaks , and where France is a happy , if intensely boring , land whose only worry is that some damned foreigners might win a soccer match . " <P> The seizing of the Pueblo prompted a report depicting North Korea as a nation devoted to peace and progress , while South Korea , which has " lived in the American style since 1953 , " was shown rife with corruption , unemployment and prostitution . On another news show , ' a commentator contemptuously suggested that to discourage bombing , the Viet Cong should put U.S. prisoners in factories and villages-because " Americans have a great deal of humanity for themselves .
