txt When managers of sprawling Olin Mathieson Chemical Corp . ' s various divisions sit down to bargain with some 10 different unions in months to come , they 'll immediately be confronted with a familiar package of pension and insurance demands . It 's no accident at all that these demands will be essentially the same as those the E. R. Squibb division of Olin Mathieson recently negotiated with locals of the Oil , Chemical and Atomic Workers ; included are full pension rights at a lower age and increased sickness and accident benefits providing 70% of regular pay for up to 26 weeks . Indeed , presentation of the demands will be an important step in development of a united-front bargaining technique that its prime promoter , the AFLCIO 's Industrial Union Department ( IUD ) , hopes will greatly bolster lagging union muscle in contract negotiation . Some gains already are being claimed . The IUD has dubbed its approach " coordinated bargaining , " and set up a special division to provide technical aid and guidance to unions which choose to try it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unions that usually deal separately with one employer to join to work out common contract goals and even specific bargaining demands . Multi-Union Committees Such union cooperation is n't entirely new ; the ND 's own coordination effort began two years ago , and there were embryonic attempts before that . But the idea is plainly getting more of a whirl now than ever before . IUD officials , who have only lately given it a strong push , report more than two dozen multi-union committees are now contemplating joint bargaining with multi-plant employers ; included are Armour &; Co. , Campbell Soup Co. , Johns Manville Corp. , Borg-Warner Corp. , Sperry Rand Corp. , Union Carbide Corp . and the Yale &; Towne subsidiary of Eaton Manufacturing Just recently , ' - ? ofiicials of four unions gathereilAm4hiimte'p ? ixie , : averva ....

" An employer is going to pay a lot more attention to us , " reasons an IUD official " if he knows we 're in a position to close down several of his plants instead of just one . " Among , the claimed union victories logged lately has been a settlement achieved in joint negotiations of five unions with American Home Products Corp. , covering a dozen plants ; IUD men boast that the combined front resulted in " a significantly improved pension plan , plus other welfare gains . " More specific , though less recent , is a before-and-after tale of experience in the brick and clay refractories industry . In 1962 , four unions bargaining separately settled for a straight extension of the existing contract . In coordinated bargaining last year they won an average 7 cents-an-hour increase in fringe benefits , including liberalized pensions , improved medical coverage , and an additional company contribution to supplemental unemployment benefits . Failures , Too There also have been failures ; a two-union effort to negotiate pension improvements on a national basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While some employers naturally resist the idea of facing any combined union front , a high official of one company that has negotiated with several unions jointly expresses cautious approval of a limited application of corrdinated bargaining . " Dealing with the immense complexities of welfare and pension plans on this basis is economical for the both of us and makes a logical approach , " he says . One advantage : The company has a better idea of what these costs ? will be than if it negotiated different plans with several unions . Another : Removing these complex issues makes local plant-by-plant bargaining easier . But the same executive cautions that the moves made so far " are just openers ; the unions are just paving the way for spreading this approach to cover other fringe benefits , such as holidays and the like . " There 's little doubt that as unions try to push coordinated bargaining further , they will meet more resistance . At least among AFL-CIO unions , coordinated bargaining might seem rudimentary in view of the amalgamation of the AFL and CIO more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bargaining strength lost through automation . But this sort of teamwork , though often talked of , has been rare . Now , however , union leaders are beginning to view a common bargaining front as a necessity where the unions involved are many and bre . considered , too weak to fight effectively one and where employers are big and diversified . Impact of Diversification " American industry has changed , " explains ! LID Executive Director Jack Conway . " No . anger do the major ' eorporations confine their perations to a single industri . " ( Olin Mathiein , for one , makes products ranging from toothpaste to dynamitei ) " Corporate mergers , purchases and stock swaps , , noW-product de , velopment , new synthetics and materials , rapidly changing technologyall serve to blur old distinctions between corporation and industry lines , making traditional union struc- tures , collective bargaining approaches and organizing less adequate to a far . more difficult task , " Mr. Conway declares . So the unions involved must bring " their full strength to bear in negotiations through joint action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from " playing one union off against another . " The ultimate aim of Coordinated bargaining is to have a single team of negotiators , representing all the interested unions , dickering with the employer on contract terms covering all his operations . The agreements would have uniform pension and insurance provisions , as much uniformity of pay rates as possible , , and a common expiration date . Some of the coordination plans are nearing simultaneous contract expiration . Out of a total of 10 unions bargaining with Revere Copper and Brass , Inc. , half a dozen now have contracts that expire on or within a couple of weeks of each other . The IUD is working to get expiration dates of various contract 's with Johns-Manville bunched closer together . At Anaconda-American Brass Co. there 's an effort to get contracts with the United Auto Workers , the United Steelworkers and the Mine , Mill and Smelter Workers to expire on or around the same date ; the present UAW contract expires in October , the steel union pact at the end of this ' month and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new bargaining approach : Mergers ' of AFL-CIO unions with parallel jurisdictions , such as the two chemical unions and the two meat-packing unions , plus closer working relations with some unions outside the federation ; along with the AFL-CIO Steelworkers , International Chemical Workers and Oil , Chemical and Atomic Workers , both the outcast Teamsters and the Mine , Mill and Smelter Workers represent Armour chemical and fertilizer plant employes . IUD men do n't shout it out loud , but concede the coordinated bargaining plan could include representation of the outside unions in some cases .. IUD officials concede they are still far from achieving complete coordination of bargaining . Fewer than half the IUD 's 57 affiliates are participating in the joint commit . tees . The experiences at American Home Products and in the refractories industry represent the best success to date , and those gains were limited to fringe benefits . Joint bargaining on wages , ' the strategists acknowl ? edge , is still some , distance away .                @ @ @ @ @
