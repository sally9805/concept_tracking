To a cult of hardy sailors in the New York City area , the winter weekend is counted a happy one when the thermometer crouches in the low 20s and a breath-catching wind sweeps snow across the grey waters of Long Island Sound . This is prime sailing weather , and down to the Sound they go , heavily bundled and goggled against the cold , to race one another in frisky , flippy , 11-foot frostbite dinghies . <P> Among the frostbiters are some of the greatest sailors in the U.S. Perennial winner is 53-year-old Arthur Knapp Jr. , a Manhattan stockbroker who has won more ocean races than he can remember , skippered the America 's Cup candidate Weatherly two years ago . In the dinghy next him may be George Hinman , commodore of the New York Yacht Club ; Bus Mosbacher , helmsman of Vim and one of sailing 's best young skippers ; or Cornelius ( " Glit " ) Shields Jr. , whose celebrated sailor father suffered a heart attack while frostbiting at the age of 61 four years ago . Fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sailing a twelve-meter , and a greater test of individual skill . Instead of eleven trained men ready to leap to his command , the skipper has only himself and perhaps one small shivering boy as crew . The slightest shift of weight or twitch of the tiller can make the difference between victory and defeat . <P> Too Cold to Hurt . " There are lots of fancy ideas about the motivation for starting frostbiting , " says Knapp . " But I say it 's simple . The motivation was gin . This nonsense started in 1932 , at the Knickerbocker Yacht Club in Manhasset . Somebody had imported some English pram sailing dinghies . There was a big argument , after some bathtub gin , over the merits of dinghies , and we decided to have a regatta on New Year 's Day . G. Colin Ratsey won the race . He 's now a partner in the sailmaking firm of Ratsey <P> &; Lapthorn . The first prize was a gallon can of grain alcohol for making gin . " <P> To the roaring fire set , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are routine , and on any wintry Sunday half a dozen sailors are dragged gasping from near 35 water , either by the crash boat or by their nearest rival , who by rule is compelled to fish them out . The salt spray often freezes , glazing the floorboards with ice , and the cold numbs the pain of injury . Knapp 's index finger was badly frostbitten last year , but he can not recall when it happened . Skipper Alex Gest noticed a pool of blood in his dinghy . " I had to take a look , " he says , " to see which hand I cut . " <P> Order of Sparta . No race has ever been canceled because of cold . Once fierce winds drove the races from the Sound to a sheltered inland pond , and there Knapp 's sister was disqualified for thunking into a chicken coop . Today , the most devout followers are joined in the no-dues , no-assets Frostbite Yacht Club . The club burgee is a polar bear standing on a cake of ice , his rump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , awards are passed out : i.e. , Upholder of the Right of the Port Tack ( to the skipper with the least regard for racing rules ) , Order of Sparta ( to the racing committee that laid out the most uncomfortable course in the worst weather ) , Order of the Unwashed ( provisional membership for those who have stayed out of the drink for five years , full membership if they have been dry for ten ) .
