txt missing column night that President Eisenhower 's use of the word " reservation " might not be " precise . " " It is a basic right of every nation to provide for its selfdefense , " Senator Fulbright declared . " That right is guaranteed in the United Nations Charter and it should not be necessary to reiterate it constantly . A reservation changes the basic agreement between the parties . It does not seem to me that President Eisenhower 's suggestion does that . " Despite Mr. Fulbright 's techceived a reaffirmation of an right of the United States to use nuclear weapons to repel aggression . General Eisenhower 's qualified support was contained in a five-page letter to the Senate 's Foreign Relations Committee . The letter was released by the committee 's chairman , Senator J. W. Fulbright , Democrat of Arkansas . From former President Harry S. Truman the committee re- ences in the 1958 relative pbsitions.11 Mr. Truman reiterated his unconditional support of the treaty in a telephone message to Senator Fulbright and in a letter to President Kennedy . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the treaty 100 per cent . " The text of his letter to the President was not released by the White House , but the committee made public one sentence saying that he was " in complete agreement with approval of the treaty by the Senate . " Dr. York , who is now Chancellor of the University of California at San Diego , told the combined committee today : " Ever since shortly after World War II , the military power of the United States has been steadily increasing ; over the same period the national security of the United States has been rapidly and inexorably diminishing . " This did not happen , he said , because of inaction on the part of American scientists , but was " simply the result of the systematic exploitation of the products of modern science and technology by the Soviet Union . " The Soviet Union , he said is nical point on what constitutes a reservation , the feeling here tonight was that General Eisenhower had gratly strengthened the hand of some Senators cool to the treaty . These Senators fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but would not mind promoting its demise by reservations that might subject it to unsucessful renegotiation with the Soviet Union . Meanwhile there were these other developments in the hearings on the treaty conducted by the combined Foreign Relations , Armed Services and Joint Atomic Energy Committees : cArthur H. Dean , former ' head of United States delegations to the Geneva conferences on disarmament and a nuclear test ban , strongly opposed reservations that would require renegotiation with all the signatories and possibly jeopardize the treaty or endanger its effectiveness . qDr . Herbert F. York , a leading nuclear physicist who was director of defense research and engineering for the last three years of the Eisenhower Administration and part of the first year of the Kennedy Ad= ministration , said that the treaty might be " a first small step towards finding a solution to the arms race in an area where a solution may exist . " It did not exist , he stressed , in science and technology . ( Marshall D. Shulman , an expert on Soviet affairs ' from the Fletcher School of Law and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States have " a limited adversary relationship " in which the security of each is interlocked and each might find the test ban in its own interest , though for different reasons . President Eisenhower wrote Senator Fulbright that the reservation he proposed " would provide that in the event of any armed aggression , endangering a vital interest of the United States , this nation would be the sole judge of the kind and type of weaponry and equipment it would employ as well as the timing of their use . " Suc a reservation was first proposed last week by Lewis L. Strauss , former chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission . Mr. Strauss unlike the President he served for six years , made plain his total opposition to the treaty , which , he asserted , was not in the best interest of the United States . Provoked By Fears However , Mr. Strauss said that since he realized the Senate would certainly ratify the treaty , lie was offering the amendment in the hope of re , ducing " the risks to our country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fears aroused by the phrase " any other explosion " in Section II of the treaty reading : " Each of the parties to this ' treaty undertakes furthermore to refrain from causing , encouraging , or in any way participating in , the carrying out of any nuclear weapon test explosion , or an39 other explosion anywhere which could take place in the atmosphere , in outer space or under water . Mr. Strauss said he feared this could be interpreted to prohibit the use of nuclear weapons by the United States to repel aggression against an ally or any other free nation . In his testimony today , Mr. Dean said : " In the event of war , or /the in a similar situation , of increasing military power but decreasing security , " but much worse . " ? Thus ' Dr. York took issue ? and more sharply and simply than any earlier scientific witness for the treaty  --  with Dr. Edward Teller , a principal architect of the hydrogen bomb . In testimony last week , Dr. Teller told the Senators that if they voted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future Safety of our country and increased the dangers of war . " Dr. Teller based his opposition to the treaty almost entirely on the argument that continued atmosphere testing was necessary to the effective development of an antiballistic missile system . He expressed doubt whether such a system could protect the great population centers of the United States . But he insisted that it could stop incoming missiles from destroying the retaliatory second - strike capability of United States strategic missiles . Turning to the reverse side of his coin , he also expressed the view that the Soviet Union , as the result of its 1961-62 test series , had obtained a lead over the United States in antiballistic missile knowledge and technology . His views have been strongly supported by three Republicans Senators , Barry Goldwater of Arizona , Bourke B. Hickenlooper of Iowa , and Carl T. Curtis of Nebraska , and by Senators Strom Thurmond of South Carolina and Russell B. Long of Louisiana , both Democrats . Dr. York addressed himself at length today to these arguments . If the Soviet Union had an antiballistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways for the Unites States to respond : First , by building one of its own , and second , by modifying its own missiles to make certain that they would penetrate the Soviet defenses , In his view , he said , the second approach is not only feasible but " relatively easy , " whereas the development of an antiballistic missile system " that would really work " is " probably impossible . " ' Dr. York said it was easier to build for penetration than for defense . " The race between offense and defense is a race between a tortoise and a hare and if only the hare does not go to sleep , the tortoise has no chance , " Dr. York said . Therefore , he declared , " If one is looking for salvation in the direction of an ABM , then one is looking in the wrong direction.n " And even if the United States should consider the development of such a system to be of the highest importance , he went on , the problems are not in the area of nuclear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they are " in the areas of target acquisition and identification , in coping electronically with all the potential confusion techniques available to the offense , including heavy and light decoys , multiple warheads , barrage and saturation techniques and so forth , Doubts It Will ? Vork When Senator Thurmond challenged Dr. York to say that the Russians had not installed an antiballistic missile system around Leningrad , as reported by United States intelligence , Dr. York replied : " They have something that ' might be called an antiballistic missile system . But if you ' mean something that will work , I do n't think it will work against United States missiles . " Senator Thurmond asked if it was not true that the American Nike Zeus had knocked down eight out of twelve incoming missiles . Dr. York replied that this was true but that these successes had been scored " where no attempt was ' made to defeat the system . " Although Senators have re-i EISENHOWER BACKS TEST BAN TREATY // threat of attack or aggression against us or our allies or in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ otherwise , in such places as for example , Berlin , or West Germany , I am of the opinion that the words ' or any nuclear explosion ' would not prevent us from responding immediately by the use of nuclear weapons . " Explained Erlier The State Department has . xplained in a memorandum Drepared by its legal adviser for : he committee the phrase was used to prevent the masking of weapons explosions under the pretext that they were for peaceful purposes . General Eisenhower said it was not " completely accurate " to say , as some witnesses have , that the treaty merely formalized the conditions of the informal moratorium that he instituted in 1958 , and which lasted until broken by the Russians on Aug. 30 , 1961 . In 1958 , General Eisenhower said , " it was clear that we were equal to the Soviets in all branches of nuclear science and superior in most . " I now understand , " he went on , " that later Soviet tests may have indicated important differpeatedly asked what the effects of the treaty might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand when Professor Shulman dealt at length with this question .
