txt HOUSTON , Friday , Aug.27 ? The Gemini 5 astronauts surpassed two Soviet space records yesterday on their sixth day in orbit . But renewed difficulties , with the fuel cell power system : threatened to end their flight , tomorrow . This would be a day short of their eight-day goal  --  the , time required for a round trip to the moon . At 3 A.M. Eastern daylight ' time today , the spacecraft was ! in its 87th circuit of the earth. ! Another problem facing the ! Gemini 5 is the supply of fuel ! for the small jet thrusters used to orient the craft in space and , , to slow it for re-entry . Ground controllers , however ? are having the pilots do every -- thing possible to stretch the journey to its target of 3.51 million miles . As a result , Lieut . Col. L. Gordon Cooper Jr . and Lietit . Comdr . Charles Conrad Jr . will spend most of their time in drifting flight , rolling and turn ! Wing until the motion bothers , Ithem , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This will keep them from doinc , some , but by no means all , of their experiments . Other- , wise it is expected to have little effect on the flight . The pilots are still " sharp.i alert and carrying on their ac-i tivities in a satisfactory manner , " Dr. Charles Berry said : late yesterday . He is the astro-. nauts ' chief flight surgeon . The pilots listened to recorded , Dixieland jazz , photographed the eye of a tropical storm and mistook a tug and barge for carrier and destroyer off the ; coast of Florida . At 9:06 A.M. Eastern daylight time yesterday , they rolled past ' the record of 119 hours 6 minutes for space flight set two years ! ago by a Russian astronaut . Christopher C. Kraft Jr. , the flight 's director , looked at the control room clock , grinned // from ear to ear and said only : " Zap ! " " Zap " is a word once seen only when a rocket pistol was fired in the Buck Rogers space comic strip in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space war . At 2:01 P.M. Eastern daylight time , the United States passed the Soviet Union 's total man-hours in space , 507 hour , 7 minutes . Mr. Kraft told a press conference yesterday that very conservative use will be made of electrical power from now on . The fuel cell system produces water as it produces power . and storage room for the water might be used up too soon if too much power is kept on . " I still feel confident that we will be able to make the eight days , " he said . A decision will be made early tomorrow . If the technical problems are too great , the spacecraft will be brought down tomorrow . If not , it will try to fly until 10:27 A.M. Eastern daylight time on Sunday , splashing clown in the Atlantic 500 miles southwest of Bermuda . This would make the flight 34 minutes longer than originally planned . Changes in the craft 's orbit brought about Monday when it maneuvered to approach an imaginary rocket home produced the difference . Asked if he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kraft said no . " We 're up there to learn both systems performance , spacecraft operation and how to handle problems , and we 're getting a good workout , " he said . Lieut . Col. James A. , who commanded the Gemini 4 flight last June , is a flight communicator . He said experiments had now been listing according to the amount of " aiming " fuel they require the spacecraft to use . The pilots will be permitted by flight controllers to do some experiments as the depleted supply of attitude control fuel , allows . To illustrate this problem , controllers have now posted a. list of experiments " and what . they cost " in the control room . Mr. Kraft said . " You know , $2.98 and so on , , and they asked me to buy some : of them and there was one U.H.P. ultra high frequency radio experiment that cost 50. cents and that was the one I , bought . " he said . As a diversion , the control center piped jazz to the space- , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Blues . Jada and When the Saints Go Marching In , all played by Al Hirt . Paul Haney , mission commentator . said : " There has been consideration given here to playing Never on Sunday . but it was ruled out as inappropriate . " When controllers told Commander Conrad about the water storage problem yesterday , they , asked the 35-year-old Navy pilot , " How 's that for a sur-prise ? " " Nothing surprises me after lift-off , Commander Conrad said . ' When the controllers told Colonel Cooper to " do a couple of rolls and a loop " to celebrate taking away the Soviet 's record , the 35-year-old Air Force flier said : " That 's all we have been doing all day is rolling and rolling . " When Colonel Cooper was asked how it felt " for the United States to be a new record holder , " he replied : " At last , huh ? "
