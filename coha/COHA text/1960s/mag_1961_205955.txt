Sanctuary ( 20th Century-Fox ) is Hollywood 's second attempt to make a movie of Author William Faulkner 's woolhat horror story of murder , impotence and rape in Mississippi . As in The Story of Temple Drake ( 1933 ) , most of the hairier moments of the original novel ( which Faulkner frankly wrote " to make money " ) have been clipped , and the film dissolves into just another jugful of Hollywood 's standard Southern Discomfort . <P> The picture combines , condenses and reshapes the main story elements of Sanctuary ( 1931 ) and its sequel , Requiem for a Nun ( 1951 ) . Abandoned by her drunken date ( Bradford Dillman ) at a backwoods distillery , the 17-year-old daughter ( Lee Remick ) of the governor is raped by the resident bootlegger ( Yves Montand ) and dragged off to a sporting house in New Orleans , where he keeps her for his private pleasure-which also turns out to be hers . After some weeks he is reported killed and the girl goes sadly home to Papa , who soothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her off to the reformed drunk . <P> After six years they have two children and nothing in common . Running across a Negro maid ( Odetta ) who worked in the brothel , the heroine hires her to look after the children and to remind her of the " sanctuary " of sin and pleasure that she loved so well . Then , without warning , the bootlegger reappears . The lovers get down to brass beds again , and she agrees to run away with him . The Negro maid begs her to think of the children and stay home . When she refuses , the maid smothers the younger child . <P> Why ? The maid mumbles something about saving the heroine from herself , but her principal function is obviously to rescue Faulkner from the moiling unmotivated mess of his plot . Actresses Remick and Odetta sometimes polarize the disorder with a powerful , paradoxical image of salvation : the black earth-mother hanged on a flimsy white flibbertigibbet . But on the whole , Producer Richard ( son of Darryl ) Zanuck 's attempt to clean up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smear the whole of Yoknapatawpha County with underarm deodorant . It might just possibly be done , but it sure does seem a peculiar thing to try .
