With a reprimand for his overzealous clergy , Puerto Rico 's Roman Catholic Archbishop James P. Davis last week strategically retreated from the island 's church v. state battleground . In a statement issued in Chicago Archbishop Davis declared that no Catholic who voted for Governor Luis Muoz Marin 's Popular Democratic Party would be subject to canonical penalties , thus flatly contradicting Puerto Rican priests who were prepared to deny the sacraments to those who had voted against church instructions until they confessed their " sin . " <P> In their pre-election pastoral letters , Archbishop Davis and two other Puerto Rican bishops had warned that voting for able Governor Muoz was a sin , but did not attach ecclesiastical penalties . Two weeks ago , while all three bishops were absent from the island , Father Thomas Maisonet , pastor of San Juan Cathedral , took it on himself to attach a penalty : he warned that Catholics who disobeyed the pastoral letters must not only confess but must also promise , as a condition of absolution , not to support Muoz ' party in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosophy , e.g. , its opposition to religious instruction in public schools . When Doa Felisa Rincon de Gautier , the mayoress of San Juan , announced that she would defy his edict Father Maisonet told her she must do public penance before she could receive Communion . Realizing that the situation had got clearly out of hand , Archbishop Davis cabled moderation from Chicago . Said Davis : " No sanctions or penalties were ordered , and no one is to be refused the sacraments . " <P> " The bishops made a tactical error with their pastoral letters , " commented one U.S. Roman Catholic theologian . " In this instance they misjudged their own influence and the temper of the people . Archbishop Davis ' statement is a compromise that saves an awkward situation . " In an obvious gesture of reconciliation , Governor Muoz and 76 of his party leaders issued a statement assuring everyone that the party platform " does not embody . . . any concept whatsoever which is in contradiction with the Christian doctrine upon which the civilization of our people is based . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
