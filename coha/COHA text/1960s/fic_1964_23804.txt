Hunting for Hoot Owls A story by Jessamyn West Iremember the exact hour at which George accomplished what he had set out to do two years before . We were living where we do now , in Saskatchewan . It was three-thirty on the afternoon of Thursday , October 28 , 1958 ; in this latitude , at that hour , and in that month , almost night and nearly winter . There was still light , of course , but it slanted in like the indirect lighting of modern homes with nothing visible to proclaim its source . It was a clear cool light , compact , as if shrunken by the cold . There were still a few bleached leaves on the willows down by the lake ; not many , and the few that were left were dropping fast . There was no wind and the leaves dropped straight down as if weighted with lead . It made me feel deaf to hear no sound when they landed . I remember all this so distinctly , I suppose , because of what George said when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the window of the living room ( also bedroom , dining room and , at the far end , kitchen ) watching George come up the path from the spring . The lake , at the upper end , was freezing over and , as it did so , moreand more small animals came down to the spring to drink . The spring too would soon freeze , but meanwhile George had gone up after lunch to box it in so that for the time it lasted it would be a little less soupy than what we had been drinking . Even though I did n't then know what George was going to say when he came in , I had gazed at him like a mind reader with premonitions . I mean 1 had really looked at him . After thirty-five years of marriage a wife only occasionally sees her husband . This does n't mean that he 's on a par with the furniture any more than he 's one with the stars . It does mean that most eyes , after a certain amount of husbands , furniture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I really saw George that afternoon , as he came up the pathway . It was the change of background that made him visible . In Southern California amidst other schoolmen , George did n't stand out  --  but here under the immense gloomy trees , with the black lake behind him , George looked terribly human , noble even . Walking and carrying tools , whistling Annie Laurie under a sky with snow in it , ringed round by the unspeaking trees which nevertheless constantly watched us , he seemed accomplished , gay , and somehow daring . George came in , put down saw , hammer , and the coffee can in which he was carrying nails . Then he took off his mackinaw and hung it on its peg beside the door . He went to the front window , folded his arms , and gazed out toward the lake . " Agnes , " he asked , " do you know what day this is ? " I knew . But I forestalled his saying the word I did n't want to hear . " Thursday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . George paid no attention to this . " Boxing-in the spring was the last special job I had in mind . " " Fine , " I said and hurried on . " Before I forget it , the Clasbys called . They want you to call hack . " We have few neighbors and the few are far away and mostly without phones . A phone call is an event . George ignored the Clasby call . He turned away from the window and faced me ; and he was bound , I knew then , to say the word I did n't want to hear . " Agnes , " George said , " what I set out to do two years ago is now done . I 'm retired . " Now that 's a simple word and I suppose it occurs at least once in every issue of every newspaper and magazine published in the United States . And I know too that there are plenty of wives who do n't like the sound of that word for various reasons . Some do n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be excluded from the social rounds which hinge upon their husbands ' jobs . And almost all , after being conditioned for forty years to their husbands ' absence , are made nervous by the prospect of having to live with them again . None of these fears bothered me about George 's retirement . Since the death of George 's mother , money has been no problem for us . The social rounds a schoolman 's job demand of him are duties for his wife rather than pleasures . And a schoolman 's wife is accustomed to having not only her husband , but PTA ladies , Junior Jessamyn West , whose novel and movie , " The Friendly Persuasion , " are known to millions , has a distinguished reputation also as a story writer . She is a Quaker , born in Indiana and living in California , now at work on a new novel to be called ( perhaps ) " Leafy Rivers . " Her husband is a school superintendent , not retired . Rally Committees , Citizens ' Advisory Councils , members of the Taxpayers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the winning basketball team around the house . So she , unlike other wives , is in no need of being rehabilitated for a life with others after forty years in solitary . She 's well prepared for togetherness . What she is n't prepared for  --  or what I was n't prepared for , when George announced at the age of fifty-eight that he intended to give up his job at the end of the year  --  was the picture this called up of George 's past life . George did n't have to retire ; his contract had three years to run ; a committee of representative citizens had waited upon him asking him not to retire . Still he was determined to give up his job . " I will finish out this year only , " George told them , " then retire . " To me it was as if he had said , " I will commit suicide in seven months . " Not that life without work seems suicide to me . But to retire in your prime from your life 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have n't been with it , your life 's work , that you 've sold your life like a bag of groceries . That 's why I did n't like to hear George say the word . Because it meant that George had suffered . It meant that he 'd made a bad bargain , underestimated his powers , or misunderstood them , miscalculated our needs . I suppose I should have been glad , this being so , to hear that , at long last , George was escaping , that he was throwing off his chains . Instead , I could n't bear to hear that they had existed . " Retirement , " I said to George two years ago , " is death without burial . " " No , " George said . " Retirement is resurrection after death . " Death ! This gave me a sick feeling under the heart . George had complained on occasion . Who does n't ? I do , and I 've loved my life as wife and housekeeper . But I had no idea that what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escape from , I said . " George , would n't you feel downcast to discover that I 've hated the housework , the cooking and cleaning and washing and bed-making I 've done all my life ? " " Yes , " he said , " I would . " " It 's the same for me with you . " " No it is n't . Work 's no curse for women . " " But it is for men ? " " Certainly . Did n't you ever read the Bible ? Childbearing is women 's curse . And they 've got a built-in retirement clause , Men have to decide for themselves when they 're through . " " Women are sad to be through . " 88 HUNTING FOR HOOT OWLS " Would you like to be pregnant now ? " " At my time of life . . . " " Exactly the way I feel , " George said , " at my time of life about a job . " We had had a vacation house on Lake McClintick for ten years and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was to this cabin George had planned to retire ; and it was here , with the spring boxed in , that George declared himself , on October 28 , 1958 , to be , in fact , and according to plan , retired . Now this was certainly something for which I had been prepared . What George said was scarcely news ; nevertheless I felt shock , the same kind of shock I experienced when my mother , who had had a long sickness , finally died . I had expected her death for two years , but when she finally ceased to breathe I could not accept the change . Death , I knew all about ; but not a world in which my own mother did not return me look for look . It was the same with George . After he said those words , though I was prepared for them , I felt as a woman might who sees her husband for the first time after he 's entered a monastery . He looks the same , but he is not the same . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not the husband I had known . I do n't know what George felt that evening . I should have asked him . But the strangeness of his being without work embarrassed me . It did n't seem delicate to speak of it . Perhaps he expected a celebration of some kind , a ceremony even . He had refused the usual farewell retirement banquet at home . Perhaps this was the time for it . We had creamed chipped beef and hot soda biscuits that night for supper . Dessert was canned pears . Really a little less than I usually manage . We finished supper . did the usual chores , read a little , and went to bed . We forgot to call the Clasbys . That was the first night I imitated the hoot owls . Since September these big downy birds , more silent in movement than snow , had begun , in the deepening cold of the autumn nights , to call to each other from the treetops . Actually , I do n't know whether they were in the tops of trees or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when there is still as much green as black in the darkness , and then the owls were flying . You see them by chance when they glide overhead , noiseless as clouds . But in the night they make up for all this quiet evening gliding with a bombardment of hoots ; and they sound then as if they were in the tops of trees . I do n't know why they hoot ; whether they are courting or complaining of the cold or simply conversing . They err conversing , whatever the subject . One owl calls , then waits for an answer before speaking again . The answer comes and so the conversation goes on . The sound they make is deep and hollow . It seems mixed with feathers . I knew George was n't asleep on that first night of his official retirement . We sleep in a double bed and he was too unmoving to be asleep . So I did n't have to worry about waking him . I had n't known that I had been wanting to imitate a hoot owl ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long , long time ; otherwise it would n't have seemed so absolutely necessary and natural to shape my throat and make an accurate owl call . Nor such a relief to do so . My success amazed me . Could I , if I had attempted it , have been doing this all my life ? Had I , from the beginning , this power ? Not only was my imitation accurate but it had carrying power ; for after the same wait owl gives owl , I was , miracle of miracles , answered . I did n't press my luck though . I was excited enough to have kept on hooting all night . But owls do n't do that , I thought ; and if I was going to imitate owls , I was determined to do it right . Next morning , as if in recognition of all the night 's other transformations , the earth itself was transformed . Snow had fallen and yesterday 's world had vanished . We were in the midst of some- thing new . In any case , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my unexpected ability . I did n't think as much as I had expected to about George 's altered state . Also , while we were still at the breakfast table , the Clasbys called again . I answered , and Ed Clasby said they had intended running over to our place for a little advice , but since their car had broken down , could we come to their place ? I wondered why we could n't advise them on the phone but Ed urged " if it was n't too much trouble " that we come over . The Clasbys , Ed and Edie , were young people in their thirties with three stair-step children , one to five , and an older boy of nine . Ed worked at the motel at the other end of the lake , which put up sportsmen , mostly fishermen , during the season . The place closed the first of October , and I do n't know what Ed had been accustomed to doing in the winter . It was about what he was going to do this winter that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling that the Clasbys should have lived somewhere where it was warmer , where it mattered less if the glass fell out of a window or a shoe sole wore through . They needed some hounds under the porch and a jug of corn likker to pass round . The Clasbys themselves appeared to feel no lack of hounds , windowpanes , or jugs . No one could have been more hospitable . Everyone in Saskatchewan keeps a pot of coffee on the back of the stove all day long and puts a cup in your hand the minute you set foot inside the door . But in no other home do you have to step across , around , through , and over such a welter of misplaced articles . ( I take it that anything on the floor except rugs , furniture , and feet is misplaced . ) And the Clasbys really welcome you . There they stood in the midst of disaster , as any housekeeper judges disaster , able to concentrate on welcoming their guests . Ed Clashy put a cup in my hands before I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good of you folks to make a trip on a morning like this . Do n't think I do n't appreciate it . Cletus , ram another stick of firewood in the cook stove . " Cletus was the nine-year-old . Ed and Edie looked alike ; rather as if , not too far back in the pedigree of each , there had been a seal . The three stair-steps were the same . Only Cletus showed a lack of seal blood . He was built like an icicle  --  of skimmed milk , maybe . He had broomstraw hair and wore it jagged , like an Italian actress . He was perfectly silent , but completely present . Cletus , as it turned out , was the reason we were there . a story by Jessamyn West 89 Ed came right to the point . He had an offer from a brother-in-law to go in with him in an air-taxi service the brother-in-law was setting up . Not only would this be to Ed 's financial advantage , but Ed considered himself a natural mechanic . I could see that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was tinkering with something out of his car . His fingers knew it so well he could work and talk at the same time the way some women can knit and talk . What he was working on was the reason his car would n't run . Magneto , carburetor , distributor ? I do n't know . Anyway , something fair-sized and detachable . He had started working outside the night before and had had the car pretty well stripped down when dark came . Then , during the night , the snowstorm ! He had left everything out there , as was his habit with engines , he said , in apple-pie order . It was n't any trick locating his distributor , if that was what it was ; but the smaller things were another story . I 'm making up the names of these small objects out there under the snow . The point is that most of them were still out there , and that when Ed wanted another he said , " Cletus , fetch me in a right-handed swivel bar . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return with whatever it was that Ed had asked for . Or at least I judge so , for never once did Ed say , " Cletus , did n't you hear me say a right-handed swivel bar ? " Ed just took whatever Cletus handed him and went on with his knitting . I did n't give any thought to what Cletus did outside , because while he was running and fetching , Edie was talking to me about their problem and telling me why it was they had asked us over . But George interrupted our conversation . He was standing at a window , looking out into the yard . " Excuse me , Mrs. Clasby , " he said , " but I want Agnes to see something . " I went to him and George said , " Look at that boy out there , Agnes . " The thermometer stood at twenty and there was no sun . But out there in the snow , with no coat on , Cletus was fishing around in the snow as calm as a boy on the seashore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was n't fishing . First , he sized up the snow at his feet in a businesslike way , then he put his hand under it , made one or two delicate moves , and pulled up something . He never pulled up something and had a look at it . He looked , felt , pulled , and started for the house with what he had . " He works like a surgeon , does n't he ? " George asked . " More like a magician , " I said , for I had my 90 HUNTING FOR HOOT OWLS doubts , for all his boasting , that Ed had left the car 's innards in any very predictable pattern , kidneys opposite each other , stomach in the middle , and so on . " In any case , " George said , as Cletus brought up something the size of a darning needle , " that 's a remarkable performance we 're watching ! ' Nevertheless , when Ed and Edie got around to their formal request , George said he 'd have to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Cletus while Ed teamed up with his brother-in-law . There were no schools at Lucknow , where they were going , and it seemed a pity to take Cletus out of school . And there was an even more understandable reason , Cletus was no child of theirs . He was not even a relation . Ed 's brother had married a divorced woman with a child , Cletus . The mother had run away from Ed 's brother ; and Ed 's brother , who did n't care after that whether he lived or died , died . was horrified to hear this told before Cletus ; but it was evidently an old story to him . Runaway mother . Runaway father , too , for all we knew . Stepfather dead . Cletus never turned a hair . His nonchalance was remarkable . I suppose if you were to survive with the Clasbys , you 'd have to learn to he nonchalant about a number of things . " The reason we turned to you folks , " Ed Clasby said , " is because George is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see a bright boy like Cletus done out of an education . " " George is retired , " I said quickly . It surprised me how glib I could be with that word when I thought it was advantageous to use it . There was no use trying to out-glib Ed Clasby . " You ai n't retired , Agnes . " he said . " And at Cletus ' age , most of the looking-after him would fall on your shoulders . " This was , of course , God 's truth . But it was n't a very handy time to admit it . I did n't have to . George has n't been an administrator for thirty years for nothing . He does n't get maneuvered into a corner easily . " We 'll think it over , Ed , and let you know . When you planning on leaving ? " " A week , at the longest . Sooner if the weather moderates . " " Do n't think we do n't appreciate the confidence you 've shown in us , Ed , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go into half-cocked . " So we left , leaving poor little Cletus like a parcel of goods put up for sale and not taken . I did n't feel any enthusiasm myself about taking on the care of a young magician who could findneedles in snowdrifts . But he was human and BO was I. I tried not to catch his eye . I could 've told him that if he wanted to live with us , not to worry . George had already decided to take him in . When George intends to say " no , " he says it . When he intends to say " yes , " he postpones . On the way home I said to George , " Where will he sleep ? " " The couch in the kitchen , " George answered . " I 'll nx up a screen to shut him off from us . " George did n't make the least pretense , with me , of needing time to think things over . " Clasby was right about one thing , " he continued . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or would , if I did n't do something about it . Which I will . " George began that very evening to do something about it . He washed the supper dishes . I could n't have been more surprised if he had started knitting little bootees . I did n't know that George could wash dishes . It was n't that George had had any theories about " man 's work " and " woman 's work . " It was simply that in former times he had n't been around at dishwashing time . George , at the sink , made me feel that I was living in a topsy-turvy world . Iwent to bed thinking about the day 's changes and wondering about the changes that were bound to come . I did n't hear any hoot owls , let alone ma hoot owl . I was more asleep than awake when George , who had stayed up puttering around in his newly assumed role of housekeeper , said , " Agnes , why do n't you answer ? " " Answer what ? " I asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Somewhere very near , on tree , or roof-tree , an owl hooted . " Your owl 's come down for a little more talk , " George said . " He 's waiting for his nightly pillow-talk . " As George said this , the owl on treetop , or roof-tree , let loose with his long soft roll of sound , There was no reply from any other owl . " He 's talking to you , Agnes . " Now it 's one thing , spontaneously and without forethought , to have imitated a hoot owl . It 's another to do it the second time and at the bidding of a listening and waiting audience . You feel self-conscious . You feel you 'll fail . You feel you 'll make a laughingstock of yourself . It 's one thing to call up spirits from the vasty deep ? it 's another to have them answer ; and it 's still another to be required to converse with them while your family listens . My voice stuck in my throat . a story by Jessamyn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Hoot . You started this . " Minerva , goddess of wisdom , owl on her shoulder ! That about silenced me . But then the owl , in the cold of the deep northern night , called again . No doubt I imagined it . Nevertheless , I thought there was a waiting note in the sound . And what can wait can be disappointed . I answered , and there was without the customary pause , an immediate answer . I was truly in touch with something . I forgot that George was listening . And to do him justice he never made another sound to remind me that he was . / talked to that bird as I 'd never talked to a human . If you say , " Naturally ; you never hooted to a human being , did you ? " you miss the point . Certainly I never hooted to a human being . And certainly " hoot " is the name given to the sound T made . Nevertheless , and whatever name you give that sound , I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild , to what lived in the night and saw in the dark and fed on the living . I was able to say what I had never been able to say back in the bridge parties and PTAs of Southern California . Nor to George himself , for that matter . George was listening now , but I was n't speaking to him . The conversation which I had started self-consciously ended naturally . When I had had my say , the owl had apparently had his . There was one distant call , then if he spoke again his voice was indistinguishable from that of the other night criers . Before I went to sleep again I had a moment 's misgiving about Cletus . What was he going to think of living in a house with a woman who talked to hoot owls ? Because I knew I would want to continue my conversation the next night . It was a moment 's misgiving only . I was asleep in a wink , and the next thing I knew I was awake , smelling frying bacon and listening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ briskly . George . who ordinarily never put a foot out of bed until he smelled coffee , was making himself over . And I need n't have worried about Cletus and hoot owls , as I learned later . He came to stay with us at the end of the week . George had required less time than usual to think things over ; and the weather had moderated , so that the Clasbys would be on their way earlier than they had anticipated . Cletus entered our lives like a daytime owl , blond , reflective , and outspoken . It was soon hard to believe that we had lived so much of our lives without him . He had only two disturbing habits . One we could do nothing about . He was , as I said , outspoken . Well , he was n't just outspoken . When he spoke out , he did so in words George and I never used . I do n't mean that he was either saucy or dirty-minded . He said what he thought and he used the words he knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Cletus drying the dishes , Cletus said , " Who had this job before you got me ? " This might have sounded , if you did n't know Cletus , as if he were saying , " How did you get along without me ? " That was n't Cletus ' intent . Information was all he wanted  --  and George knew it . " Agues did the dishes before you came . Washed them and dried them . " " And worked at her job too ? " What Cletus called my " job " was a hobby . Before I was married , I had kept scrapbooks . Not the usual scrapbooks of a girl in her teens : football programs , party invitations , hotel matchbooks . I was never interested in things like that . Instead . kept clippings from magazines and newspapers , pictures of celebrities , quotations 92 HUNTING FOR HOOT OWLS from speeches , reproductions of famous pictures . I know this sounds stuffy ; and I probably was a stuffy girl . But that 's the kind of scrapbook I kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my times , and myself as a kind of Samuel Pepys with a pastepot . Colossal egotist ! But what young person is n't ? Naturally , after I was married , I had n't found time for my hobby . But I had n't been able to resist collecting items . either . I put these , loose , into cartons , and through all our moving about , I hung onto the cartons . Now , with winter shutting down , with the housework taken over by George , I got out my scrapbooks again . Though I had n't had time to fill them , I had never been able to resist buying a fine scrapbook when I saw one on sale ; thus everything was at hand for the resumption of my hobby . I had George move the large workbench he no longer needed , now that he had finished his carpentry work , inside . It was a fine big table , large enough to hold two or three scrapbooks at a time . And to my surprise I found that I now wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to paste them in the books . I wanted to say what I thought about those pictures of people and past events . So there I would be , when Cletus got home from school , seated at my big table , busy with pen , scissors , and pastepot . I suppose it did look like a job . " She did n't work at her job before you came , " George explained to Cletus . " She did all the housework . " " What was your job then ? " Cletus asked . " I was the head of some schools . " " Like Mrs. Longnecker ? " Mrs. Longnecker was the principal of the two-room school Cletus attended . " Yes . Except I had a couple of dozen schools under me . " " Why did they fire you ? " " They did n't . I retired . " " Retired ? " Cletus asked . " I stopped working  --  permanently . " " You 're working now , " Cletus said . And George was , grunting away as he scoured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cheese to burn . " And she 's got the job , " Cletus said , nodding toward me , writing at my big table . " That 's one way of looking at it , " George agreed . Cletus concluded that conversation . " Looks like you got me just in time . " This is an example of Cletus ' outspokenness , but not of his vocabulary . It 's not easy to givean example of that , because words of that kind are not ordinarily written down ; but what follows illustrates it to some degree . George drives Cletus three miles , morning and evening , to catch the bus which takes him to school . One evening while Cletus was outside , getting all armload of wood , George said , " Mrs. Longnecker gave Cletus a whack across the hand with a ruler today . Left a considerable welt . " I was surprised . Cletus , according to his pals , was teacher 's pet . " Why would she do a thing like that ? " George laughed a little . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this week ? " " Cletus says she 's having the grannies this week . " " The grannies ? " For a minute the word made no more sense than Chinese . Then I caught on , and I do n't know whether I was the more surprised at the old-fashioned word or at Cletus ' up-to-date knowledge . For heaven 's sake , " I said , " where did Cletus dig up a baekwoodsy word like that ? " " He 's a pretty backwoodsy boy , " George said . " Well , how does he happen to know so much about things like that , then ? " " Things like that happen even in the back-woods . " Cletus ' vocabulary and outspokenness , we did n't try to do anything about . He 'd got his bad words by copying people who used them . We decided he would get his good words in the same way . But his second habit , we did try to do something about . He had to get up every night . Now under ordinary circumstances that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But our bathroom was back of the house a hundred feet , and the temperatures were sinking toward zero . Not that Cletus minded this nightly trip . He made it without a word of complaint . George was the one who complained . George valued his sleep . What with hoot owl conversations to listen to at bedtime , together with early morning rising , he did n't like being awakened just as he had fallen soundly asleep . Not that any of the noise was Cletus ' fault . Cletus had to put on shoes . The floor was not carpeted . The door stuck , then squeaked , then had to be banged to get a tight close . All this was repeated in reverse order on the return trip , plus the rattling of the springs as Cletus , after his frosty journey , shook awhile before getting warmed up . On the night George decided that there had to be a change , I , the usually sound sleeper , was awakened by sounds I could n't at first identify . They were outside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yelling . I awakened George . " What 's that noise ? " " Cletus , " he said without a moment 's pause . " It must . he Cletus . I fell asleep before he came back . " George leaped from the bed , raised the window , and shouted , " Cletus , Cletus , are you all right ? " The hanging stopped . " Hell , no . " The answer was faint , but firm . " What 's the trouble ? " " I 'm locked in . " The privy had a wooden latch on the outside as well as the inside , and this had somehow fallen into place when Cletus entered . I do n't know how long he had been up there . Thank God nothing was frostbitten . But that decided George . " The boy has to have his own chamber pot , " he said . " There is n't much privacy , " I reminded George . " There 's enough , " George said . " Besides , we can sleep right through it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can buy one . " We bought one , or I did ; though such a thing was n't , even in that backwoods country , easy to locate . I got one , finally , at a secondhand store , by pointing . Anyway , George thought we would have a good night 's sleep that night . No shoes , on or off . No floorboards squeaking . No bedsprings clattering . No doors banging . He had given Cletus a searchlight with a real lighthouse beam so that there would be no occasion for any stumbling about . But I was awakened after a few hours ' sleep by cold air blowing under the covers . George was sitting bolt upright , a hand over his eyes to shield them from the crisscrossing beams of that blinding searchlight of Cletus . " Cletus , " he called , " in God 's name what are you doing ? " " I 'm just sitting here , " Cletus answered in a surprised voice . " What are you doing with that flashlight ? " " I 'm hunting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ louder than necessary , irritated because he believed he could n't have heard right . " I 'm hunting hoot owls . " Cletus said again . " There are no hoot owls in here . " " I 'm hunting them outside , in the trees . " " You ca n't see them from inside , " George told him . " I can see their eyes , " Cletus said . " They 're ' - ? oking down at us like tigers . " a story by Jessamyn West 93 George , at that , lay down with a slap of his back against the mattress . He pulled the covers over his face , determined to sleep in spite of the searchlight . But Cletus turned it off at once and went back to bed himself . Next morning he asked George if he should stop hunting hoot owls . " I was trying to be quiet , " he said . " I did n't know the light would wake you up . " " Nu , you keep on , " George said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'll tie something over my eyes tonight . " That was three months ago . Since then George has sent off for a " sleep mask " which shuts out every iota of light and he sleeps right through Cletus ' nighttime hunts . Soon after Cletus started this pastime of his ( after all he is only a little boy , alone in the night ) I got caught up with my scrapbooks  --  every loose item pasted in , every caption written . But by then I had the habit of sitting at this table working at my " job " as Cletus calls it . And since , with George taking over the household chores , there is no earthly reason why I should n't , here I sit from midmorning until midafternoon , indulging myself . Write all day ; and when dusk comes , have a chat with a hoot owl . And be awakened from my first sleep by a boy with elf locks , who sits on a chamber pot turning his flashlight hither and yon until the icicles on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) a circle of tiger eyes . What a life ! Who on 94 HUNTING FOR HOOT OWLS God 's earth could have foreseen it ? If I could have foreseen it myself , two years ago , not the reality , which is fine , but that life described in the words , " keep scrapbooks , talk to hoot owls , take in a boy with leaky kidneys , " why , I would never have set foot out of Orange County . And if George could have foreseen his life ? He 's growing herbs ! Herbs ! In a box in the kitchen window . Thyme , sweet marjoram , parsley , chives . Rue and rosemary too , for all I know . He uses them in cooking . Why not ? What I 'm doing is queer enough . Since I finished the scrapbooks I 've been writing this account of our life here . It 's the last of March now . Often at noonday the icicles are dripping . George said there were signs of life in the spring he boxed over five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retired . That 's the name I gave this account when I finished it . " Retired . " I wrote that word at the top of the first page and handed the document , pages stapled together , to George . " Read it , " I said . I was as uneasy as could be while he read . For all I knew what I 'd said about him might make him mad . Or worse still , might simply bore him . He took it all fine , He chuckled once or twice . When he finished he said , " I 've got just one suggestion . You 've got the wrong title . " " What should it be ? " I asked . " Semi-Retired , " he said . I confess to feeling a little asperity when George said I had the wrong title . It would be a funny thing , would n't it , if I did n't know the right title for my own piece of writing ? But " Semi-Retired " was actually nearer the facts . I was about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This all happened , I 've forgotten to say , on a Saturday afternoon just after lunch . We were sitting around in the sunlight and drip , enjoying the letup school people feel , even after they 've retired , on the weekend . " I 've got a better title , " Cletus said . I did n't know Cletus had read it . Obviously , there is n't much privacy around here and 1 had n't put my pages away as I wrote . But if I answered Cletus a little tartly , it was n't because he 'd read it ; it was because he , like George , thought he could , with a snap of the fingers , produce the perfect title . " What is your suggestion , Cletus ? " I asked a little stiffly . " Change of Life . " Cletus said it fast , so proud of what he 'd hit upon , he could n't wait to have us hear it . There was no use pretending Cletus did n't know that he was dealing in double-entendre . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the title . Not just the change in our way of living : George at the sink instead of going to his office ; me at my desk , instead of at the sink : but the other . too . One stone used and two birds dead , with that title . There was no more point in chiding Cletus about knowing about such things than there is in rebuking a third grader who happens to understand algebra , The third grader 's caught on early to what he 's bound ( unless he 's dim-witted ) to learn in time , anyway . The same was true of Cletus . So I spoke only of the practical aspects of such a title . " That might be a good title if I 'd written only about George and me , Cletus . But you 're in this story too . What 's changed for you ? Going to school , studying , life has n't changed much for you . " " Yes , it has , " Cletus said without a minute 's thought . " There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hunting hoot owls ! Last night I saw fifteen eyes , and me in the middle of the circle . That 's a change for me . Hunting hoot owls . " That hit a chord . It went too deep to talk about . I got up and started to clear the table which George , unusual for him , had let stand while he read . " You two go on up and have a look at the spring , " I said . " I want a vacation from my job . I want to wash dishes . " That night when Cletus sent his beam from window to window , I thought , " Hunting for Hoot Owls . " But does n't that leave George out ? George , with his sleep mask on , and his herbs on the kitchen window , and calling me " Minerva " when I answer that first call at dusk ? No , I thought , everything you search for does n't have to hoot .

They were there , whether we hunted them or not ; greater than stars , because they lived ; because they looked back and had voices with which to answer us . I tiptoed over to my desk , crossed out the old title , and wrote in the new . Naturally , in the dark , I made a big scrawl of it . But next morning the very size of the words seemed to be a part of their truth ; and neither George nor Cletus , when they saw them , had any further suggestions to make .
