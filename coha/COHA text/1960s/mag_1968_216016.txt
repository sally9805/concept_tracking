Waddling around on feet that by all rights ought to be webbed , Oscar Madison is the slop-happiest hero in history . In midsummer , Christmas stockings still hang over his hearth , and his refrigerator is cleaned so seldom that he has milk standing up in there without the bottle . And yet , as played by Walter Matthau , he is the better half of The Odd Couple . <P> The Neil Simon comedy that lit up Broadway for more than two years shines again in this flawed but still funny screen adaptation . Heading for divorce , Felix Ungar ( Jack Lemmon ) is a casualty of the war between the sexes . The same calamity befell his old pal Oscar , an alimony-poor sportswriter with a rambling eight-room flat on Manhattan 's Riverside Drive . Out of pity and penury , he invites Felix to share his lair . At this point Simon pulls the switch that brightens the screen : the partnership becomes a parody of a failing marriage . Oscar is the kind of host who offers his card-playing buddies green sandwiches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meat . " Felix is Mr. Clean , an uptight neurotic ( " the only man in the world with clenched hair " ) who does all the shopping and cooking and charges the cigar-smoky atmosphere with deodorizer until his roommate mumbles : " Leave everything alone . I 'm not through dirtying up for the night . " <P> Can this marriage be saved ? Felix tries , by allowing his partner to invite a couple of British birds for dinner . While Oscar plays the randy dandy , Felix hilariously glums up the works by showing pictures of his ex-wife and kids to the girls until they dissolve into enough tears to drown the evening . After a series of megatonic comic explosions , the men learn enough about themselves to try a second go with their former lives . <P> <P> The Odd Couple is not quite the near-perfect comedy it could have been . Except for a handful of outdoor shots , Director Gene Saks has followed the original Mike Nichols staging with slavish and unimaginative fidelity . Time after time , the camera remains static while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is one of Hollywood 's most polished performers , Lemmon too often strains to achieve the lines of tension that characterized Art Carney 's high-strung stage interpretation of the role . <P> The film owes its comic force to two stars-one visible , the other unseen . Walter Matthau , with his loping , sloping style , mangled grin and laugh-perfect timing , may well be America 's finest comic actor . And Playwright Neil Simon occasionally takes off his clowns ' masks to show the humans beneath . In doing so , he has made his Odd Couple real people , with enough substance to cast shadows alongside the jokes .
