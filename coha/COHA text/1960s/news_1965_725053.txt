txt Nearing his 75th birthday next Thursday , former President Dwight D. Eisenhower looked back on a lifetime of memories and said , " The luckiest thing that ever happened to me was the girl I married . " One of his reasons for saying this came out moments later when he recalled the time during World War I when he decided to leave the Army for a newspaper career because of his frustration at being unable to get into the fighting overseas . At that time Mamie Eisenhower talked him out of it . " I guess she did n't really try to talk me out of it , " the gmciral recalled fondly in an interview here . " That 's putting it too strongly . What she did was to convince me that ' I should n't make any decision while I was all worked up . " What particularly rankled the young and ambitious Lieutenant Eisenhower , he recalled , was that an unkind fate had consigned him to the role of " home-guard soldier , " which meant no promotions for the duration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever make full colonel by the time he was 62 years old . Because his superiors decided he had a genius for training others he was fated to sit out the war at Camp Colt , the heavy tank training center outside Gettysburg . As he talked of these dark days of his military career General Eisenhower doodled away on a lined yellow pad . A contrasting episode many years later brought a belly laugh as he remembered how the SC112 te voted him the permanent rank of brigadier general and major general in a ten-minute span early in 1942 and sent the second action to the White House before the President had a chance to sign the first . In his 75th year , the general says " I 'm feeling fine . " He looks it . His ruddy complexion tells of long walks in the sun . He laughs easily and the Eisenhower grin flashes frequently to punctuate his conversation . He walks with a quick , sure step and with a ramrod posture that belies his years . He admits to some difficulty in pronouncing certain polysyllabic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near the end of his second term . To a visitor who remarked on his whirlwind work and travel schedule in recent weeks General Eisenhower acknowledged that he was n't as young as he once was and said , " I guess I 'll have to pull in my horns and slow down . " No one doubts the sincerity of his intentions . But any change of pace will have to be seen to be believed  --  especially by the two men and seven women who staff his little office on the campus of Gettysburg College . He has been busier in the last five years as a private citizen than when he was as President . Except in Southern California where he spends four or five months of the year a round of golf has become a real occasion . " Only this morning I started making a list of things I 've got to cut out , " the general said . He did n't tell what they were but it is known that he has started begging off on invitations to make speeches and giving his age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the younger men who are going places , " he said . " And I 'm not going any place he grinned sheepishly at the thought except six feet under the floor of that little chapel adjoining the museum and library at Abilene . " Mamie and I thought it would be nice to be buried under the chapel instead of just having a headstone stuck up over our graves . That way anybody taking the trouble to stop by would have a place to sit down . " . If the thought of death holds any terrors for General Eisen-1 hower there was not the slightest sign of it . He mentioned it as casually as the book of personal reminiscenses on which he is already working . Just how much General Eisenhower may be able to slow down his activities is conjectural . His own doubts n the point were apparent when he remarked : " I really did n't think I could ever withdraw completely from contact with my fellow Americans as long as I had all my faculties and had something worthwhile to contribute . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , " Of course , the individual is the last one to know it when he is n't in possession of all his faculties . " As General Eisenhwer sketched the most easily remembered chapters of his career in the Army , a single conclusion almost forces itself on his visitor without his even hinting at it . It is that everything that happened to him before Pearl Harbor helped to prepare him for his ultimate role as supreme commander of the Allied forces in Europe . His determination to excel with or without recognition at any job handed him was summed up in a personal philosophy of " promotions be dammed . " His tour of duty in the Philippines with Gen. Douglas during which he drew up the defense plans for the islands made him a " natural " for a top spot when the Japanese struck at Pearl Harbor . " It was a great break for me , " General Eisenhower reflected . " I had the greatest respect for General as a soldier . He fell short of true greatness only . because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence . " But the former President recalled that it was a hard-bitten officer , Maj. Gen. Fox Conner , who had been Gen. John J. Pershing 's operations chief who had the greatest influence in preparing him for his later responsibilities . He picked young Eisenhower to help run his office in the War Department and later as his executive officer in Panama . " Throughout our nearly three years ' association he was always saying to me ; ' Always take your job seriously ? yourself never . ' That was just after the first World War . I had been promoted to the permanent rank of major . He helped me lose myself in my work and taught me the value of military reading ? he had the best individual military libraries I had ever seen . " But Conner was a statesman as well as a soldier . He clearly foresaw the inevitability of another World War in the Versailles peace treaty . He was , sure that Germany and Japan , and possibly Russia would be allied against the United States , Britain and France . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepare myself , for command because the future ' of the nation depended on my readiness and that of men of my time . " Nobody likes to be reminded of expensive mistakes and General Eisenhower is no exception . But he makes no bones about one he made that cost their lives of some 200 men . " It happened when we in-I vaded Oran , " he said . " I wanted a surprise attack , putting enough troops ashore to knock out that French fort guarding the harbor and then enveloping the whole area . The British were very strong for the idea of standing off-shore and bombarding ' the fort into submission . They thought that after some concentrated bombardment the French would run up the white flag . " What happened was that the bombardment served only to alert the French and from their fixed postions they blew a couple of our ships right out of the water . As I say , it was a British plan but I could have prevented it . I was responsible . My own plan would have worked because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French were still asleep . But if the British scheme had worked , I would have looked pretty silly . " General Eisenhower had nothing to say ill mitigation of the incident he still considers his own mistake . Others engaged in the operation suggested , however , that the British high command was less than enthusiastic at the time over the concept of unified command to which they were officially committed . General Eisenhower knew this - and was anxious to placate the British wherever possible . General . Eisenhower says that the one success that he looks back on with the greatest satisfaction was the victory in Europe and the cross-channel operation that paved the way for it , He used to say that having spent a lifetime preparing for it , anything that followed  --  even the Presidency  --  had to be an anticlimax . When asked about this the other day , he replied with some diffidence that " in some respects that 's true  --  sending a shipload of marines to Lebanon is a far cry from crossing the English Channel with 4,000,000 men . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gift of the American people as anticlimatic.
