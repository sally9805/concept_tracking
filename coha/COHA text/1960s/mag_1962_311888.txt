No Exit . The idea of hell has gradually been going to hell . In the ancient Hebrew tradition it was a bottomless pit where " the fire is sixty times as hot as the fire of this earth . " To St. Thomas it was a sort of overheated sideshow that the saints in heaven were permitted to watch in order to " enjoy their beatitude and the grace of God more abundantly . " To the poet Shelley it was " a city much like London . " To Existentialist Jean-Paul Sartre , whose most celebrated theatrical tract can now be seen in a free cinemadaptation , hell is just a cheap hotel room . <P> Three people are in the room , two women and a man . The man ( Morgan Sterne ) is a coward who betrayed his revolutionary comrades to torture and death . One of the women ( Viveca Lindfors ) is a lesbian who seduced a virtuous young housewife and slowly , out of sheer unnatural viciousness , destroyed her . The other is a rich woman ( Rita Gam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband to blow his brains out . Briskly they confess their sins , warily they begin to discover what manner of hell they are in . The coward longs to be saved , the lesbian prefers to be damned , the rich woman wants to be distracted . Each involves the others in a vicious circle of frustration that by its very nature never ends . That , according to Sartre , is the hell of it . <P> Sartre of course is not really talking about hell . He is talking about existence . Existence , he means to say , is a paradoxical situation in which no man can help another to save himself and no man can save himself alone . Indeed , in Sartre 's opinion all communication is evil and love is a kind of murder . Since one existent can not see another as a subject but only as an object , the " stare " of the other interrupts " the secret state " that to the existent is his existence , and this interruption causes a " hemorrhage " of freedom that drains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . " Other people , that is to say , are a man 's punishment for not living his own life as truly and as fully as he can . In Sartre 's opinion , whosoever shall lose his life shall lose everything . " You are your life , " he proclaims , " and nothing else . " <P> The ideas in the drama are plainly paranoid but they are also vivid , and in this competent translation and production they make for vivid theater of ideas . But the drama is diminished at every point to the petty scale of Sartre 's vision of reality . It is true enough , even in a religious sense , that man is his life and nothing else , but it is also true that there are more things in man 's life than are dreamt of in Sartre 's philosophy .
