txt A group of ham radio enthusiasts in Scotland plan to bounce greetings off the moon to fellow radio amateurs in Australia . If successful , this will be the first Scotlandto-Australia moon circuit and one of only a very few such link-ups ever " patched " between amateurs anywhere in the world . According to the American Radio &; Relay League , less than a dozen such moon relays have been set up so far . These generally have connected points within the United States with points in Europe and Australia . Now the Scots will have a go . These radio amateurs are from Dunfermline , Andrew Carnegie 's birthplace , in Fife . X-ray astronomers are looking for evidence to link brilliant novas with X rays from outer space . Novas are stars that flare briefly and suddenly to intense brightness and as suddenly fade away again . Early this year , scientists in Australia discovered X rays coming from a source that did n't show up at all during rocket observations in 1965 . According to the first rocket flight in April , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sky . Observations from a series of successive flights , however , showed it rapidly fading away . By September , it had disappeared . Astronomers think it was a nova . But they are n't certain because they could n't see it . On Oct. 26 , another nova was detected , this time visually . If astronomers can show that this one ? named R. S. Ophiuchi ? sends forth X rays before it fades , they will have evidence for their theory . A research group at the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory in California plans to launch a rocket in December to find out . 0 The Atomic Energy Commission is proposing rule changes that may be rough on people who do n't want atomic power plants in their vicinity . Conservation-minded opponents of civilian atomic plants often argue that the plants " pollute " the water with waste heat . According to one proposed rule change such protests would no longer be heard by the AEC in evaluating the need for an atomic plant . Opponents would have to take their cases elsewhere . Most likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change the AEC proposes would require that all prehearing conferences be held in Washington . This is expected to make it more difficult for poorly financed local groups who oppose atomic plants to attend the hearings . Costs of travel to and from the capital and hotel expenses while there might be prohibitive . Stricter federal regulations to control American food-manufacturing practices probably will be out any day now . They will cover broad areas of pest control , sanitation , ventilation , and techniques for assuring adequate cleanliness of food reaching the public . The Food and Drug Administration plans to follow these up with a series of specific regulations aimed at individual industries . It will probably start with smoked fish , dried milk and egg products , and other foodstuffs which have been running into contamination problems from bacteria . The FDA has been working with a limited number of food companies to test the feasibility of self-regulation . These efforts are aimed at promoting better government-industry cooperation in protecting the public . The outcome , instead of strict government regulation , is expected to be the FDA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plants . How and why . . Scientists in Scotland are " bugging " wild birds to study their living habits . Miniature radios have been attached to black grouse so that their daily routine , of which little is known today , can be determined . Dr. Robert Robel , an American zoologist working with the Department of Natural History at Aberdeen University , has introduced this bird-study-by-microphone . As associate professor of zoology at the University of Kansas , he employed the technique there in the study of prairie chickens . But Scotland 's black grouse have been found to be better suited to these experiments . At 1,500 grams , the full-grown male weighs about twice as much as the prairie chicken and thus can carry the 21-gram transmitter with ease . The radio bugs the birds , reporting what they are doing at any moment , whether flying , feeding , or roosting . After several months the birds are recaptured so that scientists can replace batteries and thus keep a tab on them for a longer period of time .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
