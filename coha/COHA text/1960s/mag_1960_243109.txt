A Way to Make Money in Wall Street <P> WHAT every investor wants to know is how to make money in the stock market . Wall Street has no end of theories on how to do it , but seldom has there been so much doubt about what the market is going to do . For this reason , in today 's uncertain market , the technical experts , or chartists , who keep careful check on the slightest fluctuations of hundreds of stocks are most carefully listened to . Like horse-race handicappers , they try to guess the future on the basis of past performances . <P> One of the easiest ways to predict the future , according to a widely held Wall Street belief , is to assume that the public-or small investor-is wrong in sensing major changes in the market . Thus such chartists as Jacques Coe , senior partner of Jacques Coe &; Co. , keep close tab on whether the public is buying or selling by watching the trading in odd lots ( fewer than 100 shares ) . Coe contends that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually buys heaviest near the top . <P> When the market slides , as it did for two months , Coe holds that the public , while buying more than it sells on the way down , finally becomes cautious . When the public gets really worried , it begins to sell short in substantial amounts in the belief that the market is going still lower . When this occurs , the market is due for a rally . During the market 's lows last month , Coe 's charts showed that this had happened ; he rightly predicted a rally . Last week , as the Dow-Jones industrial average continued to rally , closing at 622.47 , Coe expected the market to continue to rise . <P> - <P> Another school of technicians , typified by Lowry 's Reports . Inc. , pins most of its faith on a charting method - called breadth of market studies-that is widely used by other Wall Streeters . What Lowry 's does is chart volume of stocks advancing and declining , correlate these figures with price gains and losses . The Lowry 's chart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the reverse . Currently , the chart indicates that buying power , while weaker than selling pressure , is getting stronger . <P> Such chart experts as Walston &; Co. ' s Edmund Tabell and Du Pont Homsey &; Co. ' s G. S. Colby rely heavily on point and figure charts that carefully note every price fluctuation in hundreds of stocks , as well as the changes in market averages . A basic part of the theory is that the longer a stock or a market average stays in a narrow trading range , the greater will be its rise-or fall-when the stock or average breaks out . Tabell , who advised his clients to sell in January , now says : " The industrial average has begun to form a base . We may have seen the low point , but the market should take another two or three months of consolidating before it breaks out in a rally that will carry it to new highs . "
