Ever since the TVA complained last spring about identical bids for **25;2193;TOOLONG equipment , the Justice Department has been investigating the pricing policies of the nation 's major electric-equipment manufacturers . Last week , in a series of criminal antitrust indictments , a federal grand jury in Philadelphia charged that General Electric Co. , Westinghouse Electric Corp. , Allis-Chalmers Manufacturing Co. , I-T-E Circuit Breaker Co. and Federal Pacific Electric Co. conspired to submit " noncompetitive , collusive and rigged bids " on private and government business valued at $209 million a year . The grand jury also indicted G.E. , Westinghouse , I-T-E Circuit Breaker and nine other electrical-equipment makers for conspiring to fix prices on sales of another $55 million a year . <P> The government charged that , to set prices and rig bids , representatives of the five major manufacturers met at least 35 times over the past year , took hotel rooms under assumed names . The government market broke up among G.E . ( 39% ) , Westinghouse ( 35% ) , I-T-E Circuit Breaker ( 11% ) , Allis-Chalmers ( 8% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the meetings , the indictments said , the defendants would designate the manufacturer to submit the lowest bid . To quote nearly identical prices , the manufacturers used a " phase of the moon " or " light of the moon " formula . <P> Under the plan , as the Government outlined it , the companies rotated the prices of their bids to correspond with the moon 's phases ; one bidding the low prices , others quoting intermediate prices , and one the high price . Thus , each manufacturer would not only know what the others were bidding but would periodically be low bidder and get his agreed share of the market . <P> The grand jury indictments came as no surprise to General Electric Co 's . Chairman Ralph J. Cordiner . Last month he reported that G.E . executives who had shown " flagrant disregard " for G.E . ' s policy by discussing prices with competitors had been downgraded and that their salaries had been cut . But for Westinghouse 's management the indictments " came as a shock . " The company said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to long-established policies , " though no action had been taken against the employees involved . If convicted , the companies will be subject to a maximum fine of $50,000 , and the 18 individual defendants to a year in prison and a $50,000 fine .
