txt Gov . Richard J. Hughes submitted a $906-million budget to a joint session of the Legislature today . The budget , the most expensive and ambitious program for state government in New Jersey 's history , was tightly tied to the Governor 's proposed state income tax . " Should the income tax be defeated , " Mr. Hughes declared , " then we can say good-by to our hopes for colleges , for taxpayer assistance , for better schools , for improved institutions , for needed highways and for so many other attributes of a progressive state . " At 757 pages , the budget had about the same heft as in previous years , only the amounts were bigger ? roughly 40 per cent bigger than last year 's and about twice the amount submitted by Governor Hughes in 1961 . For the fiscal year beginning July 1 it represents a cost of $137 for every man , woman and child in the state , compared with the $221 per capita cost in New York State 's new $3.9-billion budget . Under the current budget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Jersey levies the lightest taxes in the country , when figured on the basis of the percentage of each person 's income that goes for taxes . It also ranks near the bottom nationally in per capita state aid to public welfare , higher education and highways . The Governor described the state 's dismal rank as a " public calamity . " In his speech to the legislators and in an informal talk earlier to 250 members of the League of Women Voters , who came here today to lobby for an income tax , Mr , Hughes delivered his harshest criticism thus far of a proposed sales tax . He told the league members gathered in the State Museum , " Now there is another theory advanced by proponents of a sales tax that we should make everybody , no matter how poor , pay something . " He said it unintentionally " sweeps up and builds up the old white backlash , the old Goldwater theory in recent years , the extremism ? it fits everyone who does n't like people who are poor , or who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in menial jobs . . . " The theory , he said , is that " they will pay more attention , use more taxpayer vigilance , they 'll feel they are a part of Government . " Wo n't Penalize Working Man And in his legislative message , which he delivered in a flat monotone , the Governor said : " I , for one , can not recommend a tax that penalizes a working man when he buys a new pair of shoes for his child or a coat for his wife or when he fills his oil tank to heat his hduse . " He added : " No matter how palatable its supporters seek to make it , the general sales tax would strike a severe blow at that there might not be enough support for a sales tax and he tried to give the impression that the income tax had become a now or never proposition . Earlier today Democratic leaders set March 14 as the day to vote on the income tax in the Assembly . In the interim , the Legislature will recess for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In addressing the Legislature the Governor repeated his call for a 1 to 5 per cent graduated income tax that would , he said , , produce $180-million the first year or $232-million if applied retroactively to incomes that began Jan. 1 , Reaction Is Partisan Reaction from the Republicans was partisan and predictable . Senate Minority Leader William E. Ozzard from Somerset County called the message " the biggest package of party patronage I 've ever seen . " Many Democrats were embarthe poor and those of moderate income among us . " For months Mr. Hughes had said he would take a sales tax if an income tax was defeated . But he strongly indicated today rassed by the size of the budget . Senate Majority Leader Sido L. Ridofi of Trenton , with his face buried in his hands , said : " My off-hand guess is that the budget ca n't be cut . But I know that 's inconsistent because it can be cut . " Mr. Hughes , a Democrat , enjoys Democratic majorities in both houses , the first time this has happened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is given a good chance of getting an income tax passed despite some Democratic misgivings and some outright Democratic hostility , Generally the budget was broken into three parts : $339.3-million for state operations ; $410-million in state aid ; and $156.7-million in capital construction . Half of the new budget , nearly $450-million , would go to education , which the Governor and many other officials consider to be the state 's No , 1 . problem .
