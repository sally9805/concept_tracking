The curtain is up . The theater is dark . A woman screams . Someone eerily whistles Three Blind Mice . Pistol shots clap the air for the 3,745th time . Thus Agatha Christie 's The Mousetrap moved into its tenth year in residence in London 's Ambassadores Theater last week . <P> Mousetrap is the longest-running play in the history of the British theater , and has been since the day nearly five years ago when it passed the 2,238-performance record set by Oscar Asche 's Chu-Chin-Chow , which opened in London in 1916 . It has also surpassed Broadway 's record-holding Life with Father by 521 performances. * The Mousetrap has become a prime attraction for British tourists down from the provinces , rivaling the Tower of London , and the changing of the guard at Buckingham Palace . <P> As could be expected . The Mousetrap is a moderately awful play , not really in the same class with Christie 's Witness for the Prosecution . Marooning its characters in an ancient manor house in a snowstorm , it festoons them with such stupendous lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of things may have happened " and " There are six of you listening to me now - one of you is the killer . " <P> Unsportingly , London 's Sunday Dispatch revealed the identity of the killer in its review nine years ago . The producers feared that might kill off the play . Instead , the Dispatch itself folded . Mousetrap not only survived but expects to go on snapping for some time to come . <P> * The alltime world long-run record , however , is still held by the Los Angeles Theatre Mart 's 1933 revival of The Drunkard , which closed in 1959 after 9,477 performances .
