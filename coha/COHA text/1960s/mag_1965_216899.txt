A Very Rich Woman has ague in its funny bones . Actress-Playwright Ruth Gordon has tried to create a drawing-room comedy about old age-and the chief reason that the play can not sustain itself is that old age is no joke . <P> In its slapdash way , Woman is an eccentric comic parody of King Lear . Mrs. Lord is a solid-gold widow of 75 , with nothing on her Bostonian brain but freshly dyed hair and a yen for yachts . Lear courts catastrophe when he parts with his realm ; Mrs. Lord gets into trouble when her daughters fear that she will squander her fortune on herself . Lear is cast out on the storm-blasted heath and loses his mind ; Mrs. Lord is kidnaped after a Boston Symphony concert and railroaded to a loony bin . <P> While there , she gets just mad enough to cry . The episode might be more affecting if Ruth Gordon had not made Mrs. Lord just as odious as her Goneril-and-Regan duo of daughters . As every contemporary playgoer knows , the family is an heir-conditioning unit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Mrs. Lord marries one of those beamish Balkan boys with a rich grandmother fixation . <P> A band of genuinely old troupers Raymond Walburn ( 78 ) , Ernest Truex ( 75 ) , Madge Kennedy ( 75 ) , and Ethel Griffies ( 87 ) , plus Ingnue Heidi Murray ( 17 ) , handle with finesse lines that they ought scarcely to have touched . As Mrs. Lord , Ruth Gordon ( 69 ) relies on her trademarks rather than her talents , notably a nasally barbaric yawp of a voice that would have stopped Genghis Khan in his Asiatic steppes . Woman is her lost labor of self-love .
