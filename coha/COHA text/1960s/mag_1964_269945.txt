Each year more U.S. parents find that their children 's mathematics home work is vastly different from what math was when they went to school . This is the " new math , " and the change goes back to 1952 , when Mathematician Max Beberman and others became alarmed that math teaching in U.S. schools had not changed essentially in 150 years . In pioneering new methods at the University of Illinois , Beberman sparked a movement that has now influenced about 10% of U.S. elementary schools and 60% of high schools . This year Texas assigned 30,000 teachers to learn new math . This month California decided to spend almost $10 million for new math texts . <P> What is really new about new math is the teaching ; it is basically old math taught in a far better new way . The purpose is to replace numb learning of rote computation with a confident understanding of the structure and relation of numbers-the why of the drills . Rules and formulas are still vital tools , but new math aims to go back to the sources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than blindly prescribing them . <P> The Wonder of Zero . Math is the study of patterns ; numerals symbolize real things-the size of collections , the length of lines , the position of points . New math thus begins on the concrete level and only later moves to the abstract . Math is also a unified system ; new math thus shows the interrelation of all branches , such as algebra and geometry , rather than teaching them as separate topics . The stress is on " discovery " - the artful question that sparks a child 's desire to see patterns and find answers . The idea is to get children inside the structure of numbers by means of a " spiral curriculum " - constant re-translation of concepts at higher orders of sophistication . <P> In laying out the floor plan-arithmetic-new math begins not with the names of numbers but with real objects , such as beads , stones , sticks . By manipulating objects in collections ( or " sets " ) the child learns crucial ideas . He may be asked to remove pairs of objects from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out at the same time , he begins to grasp the idea of equality . When one runs out first , he learns about inequalities . <P> Equal collections of different things bring up the idea of number as a common property of the sets ; then the child can move on to grasp the symbolism of numbers expressed as numerals . He sees that for convenience the first ten symbols may be recombined for numbers greater than nine . He may also learn that each digit ( say in 326 ) has a " place value " ten times that of its neighbor to the right ( three hundreds , two tens , six ones ) . He discovers the wonder of that great ancient invention , zero , the " place holder " that allows infinite expansions ( 606 would be simply 66 without it ) .
