Associate Justice Hugo La Fayette Black , 76 , last week completed his 25th term on the U.S. Supreme Court in the same way that he began his court career-in the center of a storm . To his admirers , Black is a judicial hero , forever fighting on behalf of individual liberties . To his critics , he is an archvillain seeking to subvert national institutions . As time passes , it is apparent that the extremists on both sides have forgotten many of the facts about what and who Hugo Black really is . <P> The son of a small farmer , later a storekeeper , in rural Harlan , Ala. , Black had little pre-law college training , but obtained a law degree from the University of Alabama with honors . He set up private practice in Ashland , became a police judge and later a prosecuting attorney . In 1925 he decided to forsake a $50,000-a-year law practice , mostly in damage suits , to run for the Senate . Though virtually unknown , he beat four other candidates in a statewide campaign conducted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the 1932 Roosevelt landslide , Black became one of the most fervent New Dealers in Congress . He backed revisionary New Deal legislation on labor , utilities , industry and finance . He supported Roosevelt 's ill-fated plan to pack the Supreme Court . He was a relentless Senate investigator , successfully raking up corrupt practices in Government mail-carrying subsidies and in lobbying for utility holding companies ( he favored public power ) ; sometimes his inquisitorial tactics were criticized as being in violation of the Bill of Rights . <P> Removing the Doubt . In 1937 Roosevelt named Black to the Supreme Court-partly because Black was the sort of liberal that F.D.R. wanted , partly because protocol would make his rejection by the Senate almost impossible . Opposition to Black 's appointment was great , but it rose to a crescendo after the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette dug up proof that he had been a member of the Ku Klux Klan for two years . ( The reporter won a Pulitzer Prize for his revelation . ) Like some other Southern politicians , Black had joined the Klan to further his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sympathy for its aims . He went on radio to defend his record on civil liberties-and has never again referred to the Klan episode publicly . <P> In the years since . Black has left no doubt whatever about his position on civil liberties . In one of his earlier opinions , he wrote a scathing denunciation of Florida practices in extracting confessions from Negroes . Much of the South sees Black as a traitor to his native region for his stand against segregation . In constitutional questions arising from investigations of domestic Communism , the onetime Senate investigator has refused to accept any cold war modifications on civil liberties . Always articulate in his opinions , Black has become the acknowledged leader of the Supreme Court 's liberal bloc . The Bill of Rights is Black 's bible-and he takes it as literally as the Biblical fundamentalists . Thus , he recently argued ( off the bench ) that libel and slander laws are an infringement on freedom of the press and of speech as guaranteed by the Constitution .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
