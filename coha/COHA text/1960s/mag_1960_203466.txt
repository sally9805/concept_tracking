Deerfield , in western Massachusetts , is a quiet New England village undisturbed since the raids of the French and Indian War . Its elm-sheltered main street is lined with early American houses ; at least one resident still drives a horse and gig . But Deerfield is not so serene as it looks : at all too brief intervals , a thunderous boom splits the air , several hundred ancient windows rattle in their frames , and sometimes one breaks . <P> Like hundreds of other U.S. towns , Deerfield has become an unwilling part of a supersonic age . Jets from Westover Air Force Base , 25 miles to the south , blur past overhead-and lower the sonic boom on peaceful Deerfield . " Why ca n't they go out over the ocean if they want to break the sound barrier ? " asks a local schoolteacher . His complaint is as familiar on the West Coast as on the East . And in the last three years , more than 1,000 civilian damage claims , seeking more than $500,000 , have been filed against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is nothing more than the point at which the noise is turned on . Air is a fluid , and , above the speed of sound ( about 760 m.p.h. ) , it reacts much like the surface of a lake when a speedboat rips across it : waves go out and roll toward land . The sonic boom occurs when the shock wave from a jet hits the nearby ground . It follows the plane wherever it goes , and the pressure may make a sound equal to ten thunderclaps . <P> The sonic boom was never so explosive as it was last August , when a U.S.A.F. fighter pilot demonstrated his Lockheed F-104 Starfighter to Canadian officials at Ottawa 's Uplands Airport . It was a trial run . Next day the pilot was to put on a show at the dedication of the airport 's new terminal building , a great , shiny green-glass cavern with an aluminum and stainless-steel structure . Answering an official 's request to see him buzz the field , the pilot swung the Starfighter out in an arc , then leveled and came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was gone . And-boom-so was the new terminal . Only splinters were left of more than $10,000 worth of glass ; the whole north wall was smashed ; tiles fell from the ceiling , and insulating material poured to the floor . Door frames , window frames , and even structural beams were twisted . Damage : $500,000 . <P> To Air Force public relations men , the sonic boom is a splitting headache , without apparent remedy . " We must learn to live with it , " said one recent Air Force release , " for in today 's unsettled world we can not live without it . The boom is unavoidable . It is the sound of security . " Even the residents of Deerfield could agree that the point was sound-but that did n't make them like the boom much better .
