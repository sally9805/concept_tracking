T. H. WHITE by Sylvia Townsend Warner . 352 pages . Viking . $6.50 . <P> <P> " The best thing for being sad , " replied Merlyn , beginning to puff and blow , " is to learn something . You may grow old and trembling in your anatomies , you may lie awake at night listening to the disorder of your veins , you may miss your only love , you may see the world about you devastated by evil lunatics , or know your honor trampled in the sewers of baser minds . There is only one thing for it then-to learn . " - The Sword in the Stone <P> This passage from the ringing first novel in T. H. White 's Arthurian cycle , The Once and Future King , is a shade too piteous to be in character . The Sword in the Stone comes so near to being a perfect book that the momentary faltering in Merlyn 's tone is worth examining . In her compassionate biography of White , Author Sylvia Townsend Warner suggests that it was White himself who missed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roar of his veins , and who swallowed great draughts of learning as a painkiller . <P> As a writer , White was unique . He took the schoolboy classic which is also the common memory of the race-the legend of Arthur , Merlyn and the rest-and re-created it all in a new form , part magic and farce , part fairy tale and epic . As a person , White was a self-tormented man who drove himself to high and lonely accomplishment ; he was also a fairly ordinary product of post-Victorian England . He was born in India in 1906 . His mother , who married reluctantly and late , regarded sex and White 's father with total revulsion and her only child with a flouncing petulance that lasted through her long life . Constance White did a thorough job of squelching her child 's natural emotions ; when the boy fastened his love on an Indian nanny , the mother fired her . <P> Gentlemanly Idling . At Cambridge in the ' 20s , a pose of homosexuality was acceptable and even fashionable , but for Tim White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintains an apparently deliberate reticence on the subject , but as clearly as the reader can determine from her patchy discussion , White was never able to accept homosexuality wholeheartedly . Nor could he really reject it . His solution was solitude , and his cure for solitude was Merlyn 's : learning things and teaching . <P> After his graduation from Cambridge with first class honors in English , he taught for a few years at Stowe , in those days an up-and-coming public school . His learning project during the period was gentlemanly idling . With enormous industry and almost no money , he taught himself to hunt , shoot , fish , and handle falcons . He mocked this hunger for accomplishment in a book , written between hunt-club meets , called Burke 's Steerage , or the Amateur Gentleman 's Introduction to Noble Sports and Pastimes . White was not very good at falconry ( goshawks and merlins kept getting away ) , but it became his passion ; it had the advantage of belonging to the boyhood of history . Later , for perhaps the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gaelic , spent years translating a 12th century Latin bestiary , and became an armchair authority on the Emperor Hadrian .
