By a short 30 minutes , the Justice Department failed in 1961 in its bid to block a merger between New York 's Manufacturers Trust Co. and the Hanover Bank . Aware that Justice viewed the merger as a violation of the antitrust laws , the banks speeded up their negotiations , legally joined to form the nation 's fourth largest bank half an hour before the trustbusters filed suit to stop the action . Faced with a fait accompli , a federal judge refused to consider the Justice Department 's bid for a restraining order . Furious over the maneuver , particularly since the two banks had not discussed their plans with it , Justice immediately filed another suit . <P> Last week the trustbusters had their revenge . In Manhattan , Federal Judge Lloyd MacMahon ruled that the Manufacturers Hanover union had indeed conflicted with antitrust laws , and declared it illegal . It was the first bank merger to be declared illegal by any federal court below the Supreme Court , and it made the bank the largest firm ever to lose a merger case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two banks must return to their original status , gave the bank and the Justice Department ten days in which to propose a settlement . Manufacturers Hanover Trust will probably attempt to effect a compromise , perhaps hoping to sell some of its branches to other banks or to spin them off to form a new bank . <P> Dividing an Omelet . Still angry over the 1961 maneuver , the Justice Department is not in a compromising mood , intends to press for a split-up . " Some persons seem to feel that you ca n't unscramble an omelet , " says William H. Orrick Jr. , head of Justice 's antitrust division . " You ca n't . But you can divide it into two parts . " Justice plans to ask the court to require the bank to divide its accounts , loans , branches and personnel into two independent banks , one about twice the size of the other-the ratio between Manufacturers and Hanover in 1961 . <P> <P> Even splitting the omelet poses sticky problems . In the 31 years since merger , Hanover 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many former Hanover executives are no longer among the firm 's 10,000 employees . Manufacturers Hanover has current assets of $7 billion , $2 billion more than the combined assets of the parent banks , has gained six new branches ( total : 136 ) and thousands of new customers . To Justice , this simply reinforces a contention that the merger materially reduced bank competition in New York ; for the bank , it raises the question of how it can possibly assign its new assets and customers in any split . The bank is expected to fight right up to the Supreme Court any move to materially reduce its size .
