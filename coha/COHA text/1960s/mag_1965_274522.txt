Few Americans then living in Britain will forget how on Nov. 22 , 1963 , they were besieged with calls from English friends , anxious to console them for the loss of their President . Irish-descended John F. Kennedy seemed more like a scion of England to the English . It was because his father was ambassador there , his brother died defending the Channel , and his sister married an Englishman . It was partly because his wealth , aristocratic upbringing and Churchillian rhetoric seemed in the English political tradition . But mostly it was that as former Prime Minister Harold Macmillan said last week , " He seemed to embody the hopes of the New World that is struggling to emerge Phoenix-like from the ashes of the Old .

" <P> Britons were honoring Kennedy for more than mere kinship . Runnymede , the " birthplace of constitutional government , " is where King John signed the Magna Carta in 1215 . Harold Wilson eulogized Kennedy for his struggle on behalf of " human dignity and equality . " Said Jackie , in a message of thanks : " My husband had the greatest affection for the British people and what you represent around the world . One day my children will realize what it means to have their father honored at Runnymede. "       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
