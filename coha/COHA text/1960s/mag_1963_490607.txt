Notes and Comment MOST of the impatient , deploring comments on the newspaper strike that we have seen c r heard have centered on the incalculable loss of revenue suffered by the newspapers themselves and by their almost bottomless list of dependents . We have been made aware of the sad chain that now links newsmen , pressmen , newspaper dealers , department stores , advertisers , paper-mill operators , playwrights and play producers , real-estate agents , managers of employment agencies , theatre owners , stockbrokers , impresarios , curators , book publishers , press agents , florists , and sponsors of charity halls . The loss suffered by the newspaper reader , if mentioned at all , has been dismissed as a mere inconvenience . This view of the strike as an economic disaster misses one very important point , it seems to us , for it ignores the rich sustenance , the elusive yet almost essential nourishment , that the city reader draws , morning and evening , from that printed bread loaf he carries under his arm . With the exception of those people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strike , we can think of no one who has been more gravely injured than the reader ; without his newspaper , he has been subtly starving , and he senses within himself the loss of well-being , the dullness , the suspicion , and the silence of the exile . City living  --  now , as always  --  is very nearly impossible . Many a resident of New York is so keenly aware of his dirty , lonely , overcrowded , expensive , and hostile surroundings that he holds the possibility of flight constantly in mind ; the other half of his round-trip ticket is always in his pocket . What keeps him here , almost day by day , is not just his job or the immobility of his possessions but a permanently renewable curiosity , a feeling of precarious significance , an exaggerated , almost manic sensibility . He must he knowing ; unless he is kept instantly and vastly informed , he feels invisible to his fellow-strangers  --  without language or nationality . Thus do the newspapers constitute our passport , our card of identity , our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going on . The number and bulk of the New York newspapers and their passion for names and details reassure us , first of all , that we arc being watched and cared for . If we are mugged in the Park , if we come into a sudden inheritance , if our homeward-hound I.R.T. local breaks down , if we see a fire in Times Square or spot Elizabeth Taylor in Bonwit 's , if we only attend the Westminster Kennel Club Show in Madison Square Garden , some mention of the event  --  corroborative evidence of our existence and experience  --  will he in the papers the next day . Unless something has been reflected and recorded by the papers , it 's as if it had n't happened at all . And this , of course , is the merest beginning , for the newspapers do not simply count the city resident among the bystanders and attempt to spell his name right ; they exalt him as a reader , a thinker , a maker of decisions The papers beg us to give our attention to the entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making of new and complex economic policies , to the sldrmishings of a distant war , to the plight of Iowa farmers and Vietnamese coolies , to a fiscal scandal , to Our attendance is invited  --  to a poetry reading , a hockey game , an honorary dinner . Committees implore us to save Pennsylvania Station , to save the republic , to stamp out obscene books , to stamp out the United Nations . We can not dream of leaving town , for we are far too busy ; we must stay here and give our opinion  --  fifty , a hundred times a day about Nehru , Bert Lahr , Mark Trail , Xerox stock , Isaac Stern , Walter Lippmann , Sunny Liston , Balenciaga , Representative Mills , snow removal , James Meredith , and Lawrence of Arabia . The newspaper strike has silenced this bright interior buzz of names and events and opinions that are almost our own , and the ensuing echoes diminish our conversation and make us uneasily conscious of the dull , undernourished look of our fellow-castaways on this crowded island . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Last weekend , feeling ourself to be famished in our isolation , we suddenly marched out to the hall and threw open the front door , half hoping to find on the doormat what we had so long seen in visions  --  the fragrant , steamy deep-dish apple pie of the Sunday Times . Mona Lisa IF4,0NARDO DA VINCI , according to Sir Sidney Colvin , in the EncyclopediaBritannica , worked at the portrait of Signora Zanobi del Giocondo , the sitter for the " Mona Lisa , " " during some portion of four successive years , causing music to be played during the sittings that the rapt expression might not fade from off her countenance . " If the National Gallery of Art 's experience is any criterion , the average look that New Yorkers will take at her at the Metropolitan Museum of Art , which is not blessed with Muzak , will last no more than four seconds . We called on Mr. James J. Rorimer , the director of the Museum , a few days before Mona 's arrival , and learned that the Met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are expected . From next Monday through the following Friday , it will stay open in the evening until nine o'clock ( Sault -- da ) ' s hours will he the customary ten to five ) , and this procedure will obtain during the remaining two weeks " if the demand warrants ; " it will be open Sundays from one to six , an hour longer than is customary ; and it will be open to schoolchildren , in groups of twenty escorted by a grownup , between 8:30 and 9:30 A.M. Mondays through Fridays during the entire exhibition period , except for Lincoln 's and Washington 's Birthdays , when the general public will he admitted at the usual holiday hour of one o'clock . " Our regular weekday opening time is ten o'clock , " Mr. R. said . " We 'll want half an hour to clean up after the schoolchildren . The dirt we expect , from them and everyone else ! The accumulation of dust from scuffling shoes ! We 'll have literally balls of dust . Well , we get them anyway ; there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so extraordinary as the degree of interest . We 've set aside the pre-opening evening for a special viewing by the French Ambassador and his wife , the Mayor and his wife , the assistant director of the Louvre , permanent representatives of the United Nations , French and Italian consular officers  --  after all , the Mona Lisa ' is an Italian lady , painted by an Italian  --  and our Contributing Members and Members of the Corporation . Around a thousand in all . The next two evenings will he given over to our twenty thousand regular members , whom we 've invited in two alphabetical groups , with the cutoff point somewhere in the Vs . I 've been besieged by dinner and theatre invitations from members whose names begin with ' H ' and who want to be in with the ' R 's , and from ' R 's who want to be in with the ' H 's . But I have n't switched anyone ; we could n't handle the exchange of tickets . When you have a small piece of cake , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ director how many " Mona Lisa " visitors he expected , and he declined to hazard a guess . " The Remhrandt ' Aristotle ' drew eighty-six thousand on its top day , " he said . " Last Sunday , a year after it was installed , we had fifty thousand , in four hours . " Consulting a list of figures on a table in front of him , he continued , " Our attendance in 1962 , not counting The Cloisters , was 4,291,200 , as against 4,001,364 in 1961 and 2,937,112 in 1960 . How many people an hour can satisfactorily see a picture twenty by thirty inches ? " He unfolded a blueprint marked " First Floor Plan " and said , " We 've arranged to have people come in at the main entrance and proceed , in almost a straight line , to the Medieval Sculpture Hall . They 'll have to go four abreast part of the way , in the narrow exhibition hall south of the main staircase . It 's our desire not to hurry people . We 've put up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mona Lisa , ' with captions  --  for them to look at and read as they wait in line . But come with me . " Mr. Rorimer led the way to the site to he occupied by the distinguished visitor , and we saw that , in what is normally a wrought-iron doorway in the center of the Medieval Sculpture Hall , a solid , chapel-like recess of steel and wood ( fireproof , Mr. R. assured us ) had been set up behind an iron-grille railing . He took off his shoes , to avoid marring the new paint ; stepped into the recess ; and turned on some spotlights . " We had a dry run with a Lorenzo de Credi comparable in size and light values to the ' Mona Lisa , ' and it looked all right , " he said . " No reflection . The Louvre has asked us to keep the temperature at sixty-eight or sixty-nine degrees . That is easy to do this time of year , but we could n't do it in the summer , since we 're not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine inscribed " Hygro-Thermograph Recording Relative Humidity and Air Temperature ; " its temperature needle pointed to 68 . " The ' Mona Lisa ' is in the official custody of the President of the United States , so the Secret Service is in charge of it , " Mr. Rorimer said , stepping down and putting on his shoes . " In Washington , two Marines were posted at its sides , but it was decided not to send the Marines to New York , and we 're hay ing two of our regular guards instead . I 'm rather pleased . Marine dress uniforms are a little too colorful ; they tend to distract attention from the exhibit . Our guards have nice drab uniforms . " Judicious AN attractive thirtyish matron we know , who often wears loafers , knee socks , and a skirt and sweater , has just sent us this comment , made late one trying January day by her nineyear-old daughter : " Mama , you look like a teen-ager up to the neck . It 's only your head that shows you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the British essayist , critic , political commentator , memoirist , and biographer , was here recently , for the first time since 1935 , and we met him , by appointment , at the Knickerbocker Club , where he was staying . His cheeks were pink , his manner was gentle , and he looked like an elegant pussycat . " I 'm very well taken care of here , " he said , " although the bar , which I occasionally Frequent , does have pictures of the British surrenders at Saratoga and Yorktown . In 1934 , I came to this country when Tom Lamont , of Morgan 's , asked me to write a biography of his partner Dwight Morrow . I lived at Englewood with the Morrows for four months . I saw their daughter , Anne Lindbergh , yesterday ; she looks a girl , as she always did . I thought it was absurd to be nearly thirty-years away from the United States , so I came back for a visit . " Sir Harold , who wrote his first hook , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty-four and was attached to the Foreign Office , has turned out over thirty hooks since . His biographical subjects , besides Verlaine and Morrow , have included his father , Lord Carnock , and Tennyson , Byron , Benjamin Constant , Lord Curzon , Sainte-Benve , and King George V. He settled us in a comfortable chair overlooking Fifth Avenue , and we persuaded him , as the author of " King George V : His Life and Reign , " to say a few words about the British Royal Family . " The hook took me three years to write , " he said . " I had a room given me in the Round Tower of Windsor Castle , where I had unrestricted access to the Royal Archives . I went through every paper in them that related to the King . Boxes and boxes and boxes and boxes  --  everything except Queen Mary 's letters to him , and there arc very few of those , because the two were generally together . There were a great many letters between him and his father . Edward VII @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son every week when the then Prince George was in the Navy . Page 1 would be devoted to an analysis of the weather where King Edward was ( Balmoral or Sandringham ) ; Page 2 was given over to speculation about what the weather might he like where his sort was ( on a warship at Halifax , perhaps ) ; the third page would . give a little local news ; and on the fourth Edward would write , ' I must stop now . I hope that this finds you as it leaves me . ' The King had a wry large handwriting . George V absolutely adored his father . " Sir Harold remarked that the weather at the Round Tower was dismal . " I had a Lovely view , but the room was awfully cold , " he said . " The northeast wind howled in from the Thames Valley . You had to climb a hundred steps to get there , so I 'd bring along sandwiches and coffee for my lunch . " A doh attendant came up at this point and informed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downstairs to see him . Sir Harold looked puzzled , and we offered to act as his emissary . He shook his head . " It might he a lunatic , " he said hopefully , and excused himself , to return two or three minutes later with a brand-new thin silk umbrella . " It was a lady from Doubleday . They published my latest hook here , The Age of Reason , ' " he said . " She heard me mention , at a reception at the John Sargents ' yesterday , that I 'd left my umbrella in Boston , and she brought me this . Goodness , what manners Americans haver How kind and generous your countrymen are ! " We got Sir Harold back to George V , and he said , " My standby was his diary . He kept a diary from 1880 until his death , in 1936 . It was a rotten diary , in a way  --  he very seldom expressed an opinion  --  hut he was strong on dates and facts and times . He was very unkind to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was rather progressive . I visited the houses of a number of people to get material . The King was dead , of course  --  I started to work on the hook in 1948 but I 'd often go and see Queen Mary . She was very helpful and sweet and nice . She added a lot . She liked going over her memories ; she had a marvellous memory . After the hook came out , in 1952 , she asked me to come and see her with a copy . ' I think you 'll he surprised at what I 'm going to say , ' she said . ' Royalties are thought to be very odd people , you know , and when I die people will say that I disliked your hook , so I want to inscribe it for you . ' She wrote in it , This is a noble work about my dear husband , ' signed her name , and said , If you hear any grumbles , show them that . ' I felt fortified . " We asked Sir H. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no . " The present Queen asked me to come along one day in 1953 , and I did , " he said . " I went in rather smiling , but she looked grave , and I realized , for the first time , that this was a ceremonial occasion . There was a little prie-dieu , and she motioned to me to kneel down at it . She then gave me the accolade of knighthood . Shr pressed the sword down with vigor on my left shoulder . I expected her to say , ' Rise , Sir Harold , ' but she did n't . It was rather like coming out of church . Then she smiled and said , Now we can have a chat , ' and we did . She 's a very , very charming and intelligent woman , with a delightful smile . " We mentioned " Some People , " one of Sir Harold 's best-received works  --  it appeared in 1927 and has gone through six or seven editions in England and here  --  and he said , " My father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when it came out . I 'd sent him and m3 : mother an advance copy , and I called on them soon after . 1V/y mother met me at the door . ' Do n't mention the book to your father , ' she said . ' He does n't like it . ' I was still in the Foreign Office then , and the hook was about people in the Foreign Office , and he thought one should n't write flippantly about one 's profession . Well , I saw him again a week or so later , and he said , I 've been reading your hook . It 's 50 good . ' It appeared that King George V had been reading it and had shouted with laughter . Lord Stamford-ham , his private secretary and an old friend of my father 's , had heard him from the next room , and had told my father . " Mr. Stuart Preston , an art critic for the Times , came in , to take Sir Harold off on a museum tour . " My son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get back , I 'll he put through an examination on art in America , " Sir H. said , and off he went , twirling the umbrella . ? INCIDENTAL INTELLIGENCE ( OLD SALT DrvIsroN ) : At a recent gathering of the Old Dartmouth Historical Society , in New Bedford , Colonel Eugene S. Clark , Jr. , spoke on " The Scallop and Its Influences on Mankind . " Dreamland NO sooner had we walked into the Coliseum last week to scout the Start Your Own Business Exposition , which is dedicated to the proposition that it is " the American dream to he one 's own boss , " than we were being told by R. C. Corley , vice-president of China Doll , Inc. , how we could make the dream come true by peddling chow mein , egg rolls , fried rice , and other Oriental fare direct to the customer from a " Chinese food kitchen on wheels " ?

" Only four thousand down and the balance over thirty-six months , " he explained . " Your food is supplied by Chun King , largest manufacturer of Chinese- food in the world .

We got fellows operating over in Brooklyn , and they 're really cleaning up  --  thirty , thirty-five thousand a veer , net . This thing is just getting started around here . Act now and you 'll get in on the ground floor . " Ve promised to consider the matter , and moved on to an exhibit that identified itself as Tara-San , Ltd. ? New York , Tokyo , Hong Kong . It consisted primarily of two racks of clothes and was presided over by a voluble man in shirtsleeves , who introduced himself as Joseph Tiger , the president of the organization . " ' Tara-San ' is Japanese for Mr. Tiger , ' " he said . " We . have our factories in Japan and Hong Kong . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost completely handmade . We sell some of the biggest stores in New York . Our purpose in being here is to get smaller communities acquainted with our ' inc .. Look at this . " He took a black suit from the rack . " Lightest suit in the world , " hr went on . " Weighs nine ounces . Silk and Dacron . Almost completely handmade . Forty-five dollars wholesale . Could n't duplicate it in this country fur two hundred . You want to see something with snob appeal ? " He held up what looked like a pair of men 's green walking shorts . " Handmade silk underwear , " he said . " Our tailoring is the finest in the world . Great opportunity for parties who want to handle the line in smaller communities . Think it over . " Unlike Mr. Tiger , most of the exhibitors were ready to make us a definite offer . Fur example , the Dunkin ' Donuts people promised , in a sign over their exhihit , " You can make $15,000 to $51,1 ) 01 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The Jolly Roger Dairy Products loud a tempting deal , too ; by putting in only eight months a year selling their ice cream from a mobile unit , they said , we could make a net profit of exactly eleven thousand two hundred and sixty-five dollars . For an investment of nineteen hundred and fifty dollars , General Spray Service , Inc. , would set us up in the lawn-andgarden-servicing game , which , we were assured , would return us a tidy eighteen thousand two hundred a year .

Right ? O.K. When the machine empties out , you 've got eight dollars . The operation 's cost you two-forty for the pretzels , one-sixty for the location . Four dollars altogether . Right ? So , four dollars for the operation , four dollars net profit . You got ten units for your nine hundred and fifty investment . When they empty out , you got forty dollars profit . Figure they empty out a minimum of three times a month . That 's a hundred and twenty dollars profit . Right ? O.K. Say you got fifty units . You net six hundred dollars . Right ? What 's wrong with that ? " We said that it sounded flawless , and promised to give it careful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our tracks by a sign that said , " If You Are Looking for a Business With : MM . Work. ? Min . Inv. ? Large Profits  --  Ask Our Representative for Details . " Next to the sign was a stainless-steel pushcart , and over it was a blue-andorange umbrella on which was lettered " Red Hot Frankfurters &; Ice Cold Drinks . " The representative was talking to a man with oversized eyes who was wearing a smartly tailored car coat and smoking an extremely long cigar . " First , let 's get at the basics , " the representative said . " In this business , it 's human nature that counts . One guy comes up here and starts to eat . Another guy comes along and sees him . So he starts to eat . Then another guy , and another guy . It 's human nature . The average a guy orders is two franks and two sodas . He wo n't order the two sodas right away . No .

" said Oversized Eyes , rolling the heater to one side of his mouth . " Listen , " said the representative . " I 'm first and foremost a frankfurter man . I know what I 'm talkin ' about . " Tearing ourself away , we moved on to an exhibit that was identified by a placard reading , " Never Wax Floors Again  --  Multifarious GI aze- C ote . " The exhibit consisted of a platform about six feet square covered with wooden flooring . Sitting on a chair at one corner of the platform was a rather sizable blonde wearing a white sweater , a green skating skirt , black tights , and roller skates . Three or four men inter ested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nick , " she finally said , addressing the man in charge of the exhibit , " I 'm starved . When do I eat ? " " Twenty minutes , " Nick said . " How about doing a turn ? " " After I get some food , " the blonde replied . This intelligence served to disperse the other prospects and gave us a chance to ask Nick how much of an investment it would take to start our own business with his product . " Four dollars and ninety-five cents , " he said . " That 's one can of polish . You look around this show and you 'd think it cost a fortune to get into business . They all want big money  --  two thousand , ten thousand , on up . The average Joe coming here does n't have that kind of money . If he did , he would n't he here . Instead of talking money to the Joes who stop here , we say , ' Take a can . Try it . Use it on your car . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polish . It sells itself . When you want more , get in touch with us . ' That 's the way we do business  --  easy . " While we were listening to Nick , we had noticed out of the corner of our eye that a small crowd was collecting around another exhibit , down the aisle . We made our way to this attraction , over which was a sign that read , " Pizzarena  --  To Meet the Challenge of the Times  --  Pizza &; Italian Snack Shoppe . " Behind a counter were two ovens , a man in a chef 's outfit , and a small blonde in a tight bodice , a very short black skirt , black net stockings , and spike-heeled shoes . Presently , the chef opened an oven , removed a pizza , and cut it into wedges . The blonde silently served the offering to the assembled group , all of whom then wandered off without asking for details on how to meet the challenge of the times through pizzas . So did we .
