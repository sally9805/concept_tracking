" The papers wrote columns on her blonde , Dresden-doll beauty and easy grace as she moved through a schedule that might have daunted a seasoned diplomat : tea with the wife of Prime Minister Harold Wilson , a spate of cocktail parties , and a trip to Wimbledon for the tennis quarterfinals-not to mention the investiture . Even her father 's erstwhile opponent Hubert Humphrey was smitten . Humphrey greeted Tricia at a cocktail party with a hug and a kiss and said : " She is a little doll .
