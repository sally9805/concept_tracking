txt Three American astronauts rocketed toward the moon today on a critical rehearsal flight to clear the way for a planned lunar landing by men just two months from now . At 12:49 P.M. Eastern daylight time , only milliseconds off schedule , Col. Thomas P. Stafford of the Air Force and Comdrs . John W. Young and Eugene A. Cernan of the Navy rode their Apollo 10 spacecraft off the launching pad , slowly at first , then with fiery momentum until they were out of sight and into orbit of the earth . The launching took place a week short of eight years from the day , in 1961 , when President Kennedy committed the nation to landing men on the moon in this decade . First Steps Successful All the first intricate steps of Apollo 10 's trail-blazing flight , scheduled to run eight days and take the astronauts around the moon 31 times without landing , were accomplished successfully by late afternoon . As an added and dramatic attraction , the astronauts put on several color television shows of their maneuvers and of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After circling the earth one and a half times , the Saturn 5 rocket 's third-stage engine refired for five minutes to propel the spaceship on its moonward course at an initial speed of about 24,200 miles an hour . " We 're on the way ! " Colonel Stafford , the commander , radioed to ground controllers as the rocket lighted the dawn over the Pacific Ocean . " What a way to watch a sunrise ! " Commander Cernan exclaimed . Command Ship Turns Shortly after the spacecraft set off on its path to the moon , the command ship , with Commander Young at the controls , separated from the rocket 's third stage , pulled out several feet and turned around to ease its nose in to a receiving , . or docking , collar on the landing craft . The lunar module , as the craft is called , was still attached to the top of the third rocket stage . As the two vehicles drew together , the astronauts turned on a color television camera to give people back on earth their first look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transmission was the first live color telecast from space and one of 12 planned during the Apollo 10 mission . At a distance of 35,000 miles from earth , the astronauts made an unscheduled telecast that was not carried live on any of the three major networks . Colonel Stafford , holding the camera , showed Commanders Young and Cernan at work inside the spacecraft . Commander Cernan held up a copy of the flight plan . Commander Young did a floating somersault in the weightless condition of the cabin . The astronauts showed more pictures of the earth , including shots of nighttime coming over // the eastern part of the United States . Once again , the blackness of space stood out . When the first telecast began , the two vehicles were 10,000 miles away from earth , traveling about 10 feet apart . The camera was aimed out the command ship window at the lunar module nestled against the Saturn . " Old Snoopy there looks good , " a ground controller told the astronauts , using the nickname for the lunar module drawn from the beagle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship on this flight is nicknamed Charlie Brown , from the same comic strip . Later , the command ship pulled the lunar module away from its rocket garage , and the two linked ships , 59 feet long , aimed for the moon . The telecast showed the Saturn rocket , venting some of its excess fuel , falling away from the Apollo 10 . The rocket appeared on television screens as no bigger than a quarter . To pull farther away and avoid the danger of colliding with its discarded Saturn , the command ship 's main rocket was fired briefly . " We 're leaving the 4-B way behind , " Colonel Stafford reported , referring to the Saturn stage 's numerical designation . A radio command from the controllers at the Manned Spacecraft Center at Houston ignited the Saturn 's engine once more , heading it on a trajectory that will whip it around the moon and send it off farther into space , clear of both earth and moon , as a satellite of the sun . No Correction Needed By this time , the flight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moon was good enough so that a midcourse aiming correction , planned for tonight , would not be necessary . As Apollo 10 coasted farther and farther away from earth , it was gradually losing speed because of the continuing but weakening tug from earth 's gravity . When it draws near the moon , lunar gravity will exert a greater influence , pulling it in at an accelerated speed . Three other correction maneuvers , accomplished by firing the spacecraft 's small thruster rockets , are scheduled before Apollo 10 is to swing into lunar orbit on Wednesday . To get into lunar orbit , the craft 's main rocket must fire to slow the combined vehicles sufficiently to be captured by the moon 's gravity . The plan is for Apollo 10 to circle the moon for 611/2 hours . In December the Apollo 8 crew became the first men to orbit the moon , circling it for 20 hours at an altitude as low as 69 miles . As Near as 9 Miles But Apollo 8 was not equipped with a lunar module . The first manned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , came in March during the earth-orbiting Apollo 9 mission . On Thursday , if all goes well , Colonel Stafford and Commander Cernan plan to crawl through a connecting tunnel into the LEM and cast off forl a series of maneuvers . These ' would take the bug-shaped vehide as close as 9 miles from the moon 's surface over the intended site for the Aprilo 11 landing . The site is on the dry plain known as the Sea of Tranquility . This is planned as a test of the LEM 's landing radar and its ability to operate smoothly under the influence of the moon 's weak and somewhat irregular gravitational field . After the upper stage of the LEM rejoins the command ship , piloted by Commander Young , it will be jettisoned , and the three men will being their 54-hour return journey for a splashdown in the Pacific May 26 . The Apollo 10 flight has been described as the riskiest and most complex of the $24-billion Apollo project . At a news conference here after the launching , Dr. Wernher von Braun , director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ala. , said : " I think if Apollo 10 comes in time and everything is sucessful , we can fly Apollo 11 in July as planned . " Apollo 11 is scheduled to be launched July 16 for its moonlanding attempt . The rocket is ready to be rolled to its launching next Wednesday . Commander Cernan was awakened at 6:50 A.M. for a private church service . His fellow crewmen were up by 7:30 , and the three of them sat down to the traditional launching day breakfast of steak and eggs . 320 Feet Up In Elevator After a short medical examination , the astronauts donned their suits , picked up their portable air-conditioning units and left by van for launching pad 39B , which was being put into service for the first time with this flight . By high speed elevator they rode to a platform 320 feet up the service tower supporting the 363-foot Saturn 5 rocket with its Apollo payload . They climbed into the coneshaped command ship at 10 A.M. For nearly two hours , they checked and rechecked their instrument panels , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away read off the data flashing across their consoles showing that all was going well with the countdown . During a planned interruption in the countdown , technicians finished loading the rocket 's three stages with fuel . They had fallen about an hour behind during the night . Smoke Hides Rocket Then , with the same punctuality that marked the four previous Saturn 5 's , the mighty rocket 's first-stage engines roared to flaming life . Because of the wind and angle of view , the entire rocket was enveloped with orange smoke until it began to rise off the pad , The weight of the rocket and spacecraft , all fully fueled , was 6,493,800 pounds at ignition . At liftoff , only a few seconds later , the rocket 's five engines had already consumed 85,800 pounds of propellants . " What a ride ! " Commander Cernan called to the ground as the rocket began to arc outl over the Atlantic Ocean , rising higher and higher . The first-stage engines burned for 2 minutes 40 seconds before they cut off and the entire stage was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly 7 minutes before they , too , switched off automatically and the stage was separated . The third stage 's single engine gave Apollo 10 its final lift into an orbit , about 115 miles at its lowest point and 118 miles at its highest . " It 's beautiful out there , " Commander Ceman said . " Fantastic , man , really fantastic ! Man this is the greatest ! " On their second turn around earth , over Australia , the astronauts were given the " go " signal for the translunar injection  --  the refiring of the Saturn 's third stage to send them toward the moon . Colonel Stafford reported some jarring vibrations during the firing , but there was no apparent problem .
