txt Action on Schools The contrast between the Administration 's emphasis on economy and the Democrats ' emphasis on putting up the cash to meet important needs is especially sharp on the issue of Federal aid to education . The Administration has called for a modest program of school construction by which the Federal Government would share with the states the expense of retiring 43 billion in construction bonds issued by needy school districts . The program would cost an estimated $2.2 billion , but it would be stretched over thirty years . A bill to that end was defeated in the Senate last week 61 to 25 . The Democrats have called for a broad program of Federal aid to education , and last week the Senate took up two such measures . One , sponsored by Pat , Michigan Democrat , authorized grants to states of $500 million a year for two years and provided for 50,000 to 70,000 new classrooms . A substitute measure sponsored by Joseph S. Clark , Pennsylvania Democrat , called for a permanent program of Federal aid to school construction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . On Wednesday parliamentary maneuvering over the Clark bill produced a vote of 44 to 44 , and Vice President Nixon cast his first tie-breaking vote of the session , defeating the measure , There was some question as to whether the tie hagl been arranged by the Democrats , for in breaking it Mr. Nixon went on record as having opposed a program that provided aid not only for construction but for teachers . On Thursday the bill was amended to provide an addie ? tional $800 million in grants for ' teacher salaries over the two years . The measure passed , 51 to 34 . In the House , however , the future of the bill is doubtful . There a coalition of Republicans and Southern Democrats has control of the Rules Committee , which regulates the flow of legislation to the floor . The prospect is that the bill may be bottled up . Action on Rights Proposals for new civil rights legislation , which for months have languished in Congressional committees , have suddenly taken on new urgency . The reason is that under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make their records on an issue that will be important in the campaign . Bottled up in the House Rules Committee has been a Modified Administration bill that , among other things , provides for crinzinal penalties for obstructing courtordered school integration and for Federal action against accused incendiaristS fleeing across state lines . In the key area of voting rights , it calls only for the preservation of Federal voting records . The strategy of those calling for action on civil rights is to force this bill out of committee and then toughen it up by amending it on the floor . The big fight , in both houses , will be over two proposals meant to circumvent obstruction to Negro voting . One , advanced by the Civil Rights Commission , would empower the President to appoint Federal registrars to enroll Negroes whose voting rights had been infringed . The other , recommended by Attorney General William P. Rogers , would authorize Federal courts to appoint " referees " to register Negroes and protect their rights at the polls . Civil rights advocates are divided over the merits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the other to the floor . Southerners Bitter Last week the House Rules Committee began public hearings on the modified bill amid charges from Southerners that those supporting the new proposals were out to " manacle " the South . In the Senate , where debate on civil rights legislation is scheduled to begin a week from tomorrow , the Rules Committee heard Mr. Rogers oppose the registrar plan and defend his own . The registrar proposal " just wo n't work , " he said , because it would not affect state elections ? and in most cases state and Federal candidates are listed on the same ballot . Furthermore , he said , it would be subject to lengthy judicial review , carried no penalty for obstruction at the polls and would be impossible to enforce . His referee plan , he declared , overcame all these objections and would operate within the present judicial framework . Observers felt that the Senate would take some action on a strong civil rights measure  --  and with the support of Majority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson of Texas . As a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to de-emphasize his identity with the South . Democrats Maneuver At this stage of the Democratic Presidential race , Senator John F. Kennedy of Massachusets seems to be the front-runner . Some observers figure he has more than 400 delegate votes  --  and 761 are needed to nominate . But there are numerous hurdles between him and the nomination . The first is the state primaries . Up to last week he faced opposition in only one  --  Wisconsin ( April 5 ) in which Senator Hubert H. Humphrey is also running . Last week 2 " r . Humphrey challenged him to enter West Virginia ( May 10 ) and he accepted . That puts Mr. Kennedy in eight primaries , Mr. Humphrey in five . If Mr. Kennedy gets by the primaries , he says his principal threat will be Senate Majority Leader Lyndon Johnson of Texas , an undeclared candidate . Some observers feel that Mr. Kennedy may be over - playing Mr. Johnson 's strength in order to persuade Northern Democrats to unite against the Texan . Mr. Johnson is believed to have about 400 votes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Southwest . Last week at a conference of Western Democrats in Albuquerque , Mr.-Johnson 's supporters made a pitch for-non-Southern support by speaking of him as " that great Westerner . " Thus there is the possibility that Mr , Kennedy and Mr. Johnson might each be strong enough to deny the nomination to the other ? without being able to win it himself . In that case the way might be opened for one of the other undeclared candidates . Last week attention focused on Senator Stuart Symington of Missouri . Mr. Symington is reported to have Harry Truman 's backing ? although some Democratic circles feel that might not necessarily be a great advantage . In any event , the Symington supporters are trying to sell their man as the ideal compromise candidate between North and South , liberals and conservatives  --  and as a defense expert to boot . On Thursday Mr. Symington paid a visit to New York , He lunched at the National Democratic Club , attended a reception ? for Democratic legislators and a private dinner for county chairmen and local party leaders . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ host , introducing Mr. Symington as a man with a record " which qualifies him beyond question for the greatest public trust . "
