AMERICANS , enthralled by the personality of their chief executive and the power of his office , tend to talk about their political history in terms of presidential administrations . Yet last week , when it was learned that Earl Warren , the 14th Chief Justice of the United States , would soon retire from the Supreme Court , it was clear that another branch of government can define a historic period just as sharply-if not more so . For the past 15 years , the extraordinary " Warren court , " spanning all but a few months of the terms of three Presidents , has had no less an impact on American life than the Eisenhower , Kennedy and Johnson administrations combined . <P> Under Warren , the court has addressed itself principally to three great areas : civil rights , reapportionment under the one-man , one-vote doctrine , and criminal justice . As earlier courts have been dominated by such concerns as property rights , the building of the central government and slavery , Warren 's court confronted , in an unusual number of cases , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing , the court guaranteed that it would spark controversy . As Oliver Wendell Holmes said of the court in one of his celebrated remarks : " We are very quiet there , but it is the quiet of the storm center . " <P> Activist Tradition . There is no compulsory retirement for a Supreme Court Justice , and Warren , at 77 , could have remained active as long as health and spirit lasted . Mr. Justice Holmes was writing lucid decisions in his 90s ; Justice Hugo Black shows few signs of faltering at 82 . Warren apparently wanted to retire while his physical and mental abilities were still keen . Moreover , he was eager to enable President Johnson , a personal friend , to name a new Chief Justice who would follow in the liberal , activist tradition . <P> The Chief Justice was also worried , according to friends , that Richard Nixon , a man he heartily dislikes , would be elected President in November and fill the spot with a conservative. * Several Republican Senators , similarly convinced that Nixon would win in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pick his own Chief Justice . But Johnson has tradition firmly on his side-John Adams appointed John Marshall Chief Justice a month before leaving office-and he will almost certainly ignore their demand . Immediate speculation as to his choice centered on two Associate Justices : Abe Fortas , Johnson 's close friend and his first appointee to the court , and William Brennan Jr. , who shares Warren 's philosophy on most issues . <P> Productive &; Exciting . Last week , however , most eyes focused on the court that has been rather than the one that will be . By any accounting , the Warren court has been the most influential since the Marshall court ( 1801-35 ) established the judiciary as the true third branch of the federal system and , with its decisions , laid the legal groundwork for a strong central government in the U.S. Yet , as Fred Rodell , the Yale Law School 's Supreme Court specialist , points out , " John Marshall had 34 years to do what he did . Warren did his fantastic work in only 15 . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court has ever had . "
