Mr. Kriegel Leaches English at the City College of New Yolk , and is currently working on a novel . A commonplace of those who yearly besiege Washington on behalf of the space crusade is " technological fallout , " the existence of which apparently offers our blistered paradise inestimable benefit as it continues on its merry dance of progress . Valid or not , I find myself most willing to accept the argument since I prefer to go to the moon than to go to hell ( in America , there is always the landscape of the mind for that ) . Nevertheless , I insist on " a strong national commitment " to what college presidents and Congressmen call " the arts and humanities , " as well as to technology . And like an Athenian standing in the shadow of Socrates , I can now detect the " literary fallout " descending from our struggle for freedom in Vietnam . I can even foresee the day when one of my graduate students will enter my office and announce that he wants to do a doctoral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vietnam , Vietnam : The Realm of Fiction , the Horror of War . I offer the title for a mere prefatory acknowledgment . ) His dissertation problem would be simple enough : to discover how American writers responded to our war in Vietnam Having been informed by Dr Bell of the end of ideology and having been informed by numerous other doctors of the end of God , what possible approach could the novelist take to this latest LI S crusade for freedom 's Dean Rusk is not Leopold Bloom , but the need for an Everyman is apparent Traditionally . the novel has forced the writer to shift his focus from the general to the particular . But in dealing with Vietnam , novelists must face up to the opposite task . They must be willing to give up realism for the kind of allegory that will take the reader beyond the immediacy of the horror in older to see clearly what it has done to us Television gives us ( he horror every evening with hardly any attempt to hide it It 1 , , simply there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dutiful cameramen of our technological paradise The novelist 's problem is to move beyond this , to create a narrative order so that we may see the horror itself in a new and hroader dimension Perhaps his task is impossible . Very few novels have succeeded in depicting the extermination of European Jewry with this kind of excruciating yet simple intensity In Camus ' century of fear , fiction may have met its match in the sheer preponderance of horror . Tragedy is dead , and even " blaik humor " may be the last gasp of comedy in our time . Of the novels here William Wilson 's The LBJ Brigade , published in Januai y , 1966 , had already been reviewed in The Nation by Joel Lieber Pune 27 , 19661 I mention it now because its reissue this year was accompanied by a press release which left me with the uncomfortable feeling that radical opposition to the war is itself in danger of being packaged as one moic commodity on a commodity-glutted market . Moie important , though , Mi Wilson 's individual sentences ale sometimes embarrassing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentenLe , the prose assumes a kind of nervous anguish , a Jumping muscularity , that is remarkably effective It makes THL NarioN/Ottober 23 , 1907 us see ourselves caught in the moral vacuity of our position in Vietnam . A man should be mighty careful what he chooses to love , what he chooses to fight for , Stephen thought Because life will damned well make the choice stick . With this thought , Stephen Courcey , a young American volunteer in " Southeast Asia , " meets his death in Daniel Ford 's Incident at Muc Wa . In some respects , Ford is more successful than Wilson . Though his prose lacks the nervous energy of Wilson 's , he has managed to make Stephen and the other members of the American " raiders " sympathetic and appealing . And he has even managed some Twainesque situations about a subject which seems most unlikely to yield any humor But Ford , in trying to write a novel about Vietnam that does not shock , may have succeeded too well . Despite his obvious disgust , he assumes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and an ethic , however misdirected , he knows that we Americans are victims of our own pragmatic natures . " I 'm here , " Stephen told her " This is my job I have to do my job the best way I know how " But Ford fails to convince me that his war is the war I know it to he . According to the book jacket , Thomas Taylor , author of A-18 , is an officer in the American army who has served in Vietnam and " won seven decorations , including the Silver Star and two Bronze Stars for valor while commanding a company of paratroopers " A-18 is a pedestrian adventure novel , but what fascinates me about it is that it has apparently been written from the honest conviction that the American cause is worth fighting and dying for . It 's author is another pragmatic American , another believer in the simplistic efficiency which is destroying Vietnam in the name of freedom . To do him justice , Taylor captures the " new breed of soldiers , " albeit in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the minor aie our own faces , jaws set , eyes narrow and clear , legitimate murderers all , authorized by law and the collective ft ustration of a nation . John Sack 's M is not technically a novel but a book of reportage which chronicles the life of one United States infantry company from basic training to its first armed engagement in Vietnam . M is one of the finest examples of what has come to he called the " documentary novel " Sack manages to make M Company both vivid and human , deeply human , to the extent that 407 even when M Company makes its first " kill , " a 7-year-old Vietnamese girl whose head is blown open , our sympathy is with these soldiers caught in a world they neither made nor understand nor want . M is laboratory proof of Hannah Arendt 's banality of evil thesis . Sack 's approach is essentially the approach of the impressionistic prose poet ; he has gone to school with James Agee and made very good use of what he has learned . He is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tams . . with a friend who pulled down $50 an hour sitting in chairs with an Olivetti and looking over his shoulder as though to say , ' As long as you 're up , get me a Grant 's ' in the studios of Ebony magazine 's photographers " ; he is capable of describing how orders simply get twisted in the relaying of them , so that the village that was not to be burned was burned anyway , until " there was n't a Vietnamese farmhouse that was n't lust a layer of smoldering black dust " He has written a superb book . The most impressive of the lot is Victor Kolpacoff 's The Prisoners of Quai Dong , a remarkable first novel , written in a controlled prose that comes closest to creating the narrative order for horror that I called for earlier a contemporary allegorical drama which does not resort either to artifice or shock . The action takes place in an American military stockade in South Vietnam , where the Donator , Lieutenant Kreuger , has been sentenced to hard labor because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which originates in his seeing " not the enemy , but faces " through his field glasses . Because he is able to understand and to speak Vietnamese , Kreuger is ordered to report to an interrogation shed to aid in the questioning of a 17-year-old Vietcong suspect The shed becomes an effective microcosm for the metaphoric hell of America . Kolpacoff depicts the intense physicality of the tension , the violence beneath the surface that finally takes the boy 's life , the silence which ultimately betrays Kreuger by forcing him into the ranks of the legitimate murderers The symbolism is effective because it intensifies the novelist 's vision . Kolpacoff never lets us go , and more than any of the other novels under discussion here The Prisoners of Qum Dong envelops the American reader with what he has done in the here and now . Kreuger is America , but he is also America 's victim , just as the humanitarian Dr. Mason is its victim ; Nguyen , the quiet South Vietnamese interrogator is its victim : Lieutenant Buckley , the efficiency expert gone to war , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the taceless brutality that one can see down all Our streets , even he is its victim .
