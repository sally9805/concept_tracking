Giovanni Battista Tiepolo wanted people to look up to his art . He painted his most famous work on ceilings . Venetian by birth and rococo by temperament , the 18th century master loved to loft dangling goddesses , altitudinous angels and rafters of neck-craning cherubs . His specialty , naturally , was clouds , and his best work adorns sundry ceilings from Madrid 's royal palace to Wurzburg 's bishop 's Residenz . Last week Tiepolo unexpectedly raised the roofs in London . <P> An enterprising and inquisitive art expert from Christie 's auction house , David Carritt , 37 , a protg of the late Bernard Berenson , followed up a report that a French international banker , who owned a London town house around the turn of the century , had bought and installed five Tiepolos , which , he believes , once graced the Paris home of Baron Nathaniel de Rothschild . " I 'm always looking for Tiepolos , " says Carritt , who visited the house , owned since 1923 by Egypt and now the United Arab Republic 's embassy . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potentially worth $700,000 . <P> The central panel , " Time Abducting Beauty , " is a paragon of Tiepolo 's pagan allegories rich with Olympian overtones . Unquestionably it is the best Tiepolo in Britain , Carritt said , but despite popular demand , the public will not see it . At week 's end TJ.A.R. ' s President Gamal Abdel Nasser ordered his London embassy to have the Tiepolo paintings dismantled and shipped to Cairo . Nasser 's reported plan : to exhibit them in the Egyptian capital , then offer them for sale to the world 's museums . Said a curator of Britain 's National Gallery : " It 's a nasty blow , but since they 're diplomatically immune , I suppose all we can do is salute when they go by . "
