Still wearing his racing dungarees , Peter Scott , helmsman of Britain 's Sovereign , sat in Newport 's Ann Street Armory answering reporters ' questions . Why was Sovereign 's mainsail flapping like a sheet on a clothesline ? " I 'm afraid , " smiled Scott , " that 's its normal behavior . " Well , what was the most encouraging thing about Sovereign 's initial performance ? Scott sighed . " The most encouraging thing was that Constellation did n't beat us by more . " <P> If ever a stiff upper lip was called for , this was it . In the first test of the best of-seven series , Constellation had trounced Sovereign by 5 min. 34 sec. , leading every foot of the way around the 24.3-mile triangular course . It could hardly get any worse-but it did . In the second race , with crashing seas and a stiff , 20-knot breeze , Connie went out and humiliated Sovereign , winning by the widest margin in modern America 's Cup history . <P> Seamanship was never an issue ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the designers ' drawing boards . Sovereign 's Scott actually put his boat across the starting line five lengths ahead . But Rival Helmsman Bob Bavier simply sailed Constellation through Sovereign 's lee , within 15 minutes had a ten-length lead as Designer Olin Stephens ' powerful hull knifed smoothly through the buffeting swells , while Sovereign pounded like a flat-bottomed scow . When Constellation swept across the finish line , Sovereign was 21 miles and more than 20 minutes behind . Aboard the British tender , Sovereign 's designer , David Boyd , hid his face in his hands . <P> The third race was more of the same : Constellation winning by 6 min. 33 sec . Only a miracle could help Sovereign now-and Scott was a realist . " What do I think of Sovereign 's chances ? " he answered reporters . " I expect pretty much the same as you . "
