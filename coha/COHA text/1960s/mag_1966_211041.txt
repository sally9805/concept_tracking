Charles de Gaulle arrived in Cambodia last week , touching off a paroxysm of pageantry and adulation that might have humbled a lesser man . As his plane landed , royal guards in gold-threaded tunics and pantaloons stood at the ready with rolls of ceremonial straw matting , in case the exalted visitor decided to sit down on the tarmac . <P> Mauve silk umbrellas were hoisted over the heads of General and Madame de Gaulle , while 200 dusky , nubile Cambodian maidens scattered jasmine petals from beaten-silver bowls in their path . The entire Cambodian jet air force-four null - flew past to take De Gaulle 's salute . <P> <P> Personal Attention . Host Prince Norodom Sihanouk had long been on record as considering De Gaulle and Mao Tse-tung the two greatest men in the world ; thus , since Mao had never made the scene , De Gaulle was clearly Cambodia 's all-time guest . Ever since De Gaulle invited himself , Sihanouk had been beside himself with preparations , personally presiding over every detail . <P> Nothing but the Queen Mother 's own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he decided , and set to work redecorating it . Furniture was imported from France and upholstered in shimmering Cambodian silk . So that " everything would be perfect , " boasted the Prince , he had even replanted the gardens and flown in a maitre d'htel and a chambermaid from Paris ' Hotel Crillon . <P> <P> Sihanouk needed all the prestige he could extract from touching the hem of De Gaulle 's khaki tunic . In the green-and-gold Throne Pavilion , Sihanouk made the two-star French brigadier general an Honorary Supreme General of the Royal Khmer Armed Forces . Under a great moon at the ancient temple of Angkor Wat , Sihanouk recreated the festival of the coronation of a Khmer king . Everywhere , in his toasts and speeches , the Prince was all praise , reminding De Gaulle of " your prestige , your wiseness , your clairvoyance , your sense of equity . " <P> Series of Tableaux . De Gaulle 's gracious reply came in the huge Olympic Stadium in Pnompenh . After 1,000 monks had chanted prayers for him , and 100,000 well-drilled Cambodians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staged a kind of half-time football series of tableaux forming the words Vive la France with French and Cambodian flags and Vive De Gaulle with placards , the general took the rostrum . Bordering as it does on Viet Nam , Cambodia was a good place to amplify a message meant for the U.S.
