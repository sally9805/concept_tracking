It happens all the time . An ex-school teacher , nice fellow , intellectual and all that , turns around and knocks out a song and it becomes a big hit . The former teacher in this case is an Englishman named Geoff Stevens , 32 , who even sang along in the recording , he says , " just for a giggle . " Last week Stevens ' Winchester Cathedral , released only six weeks ago in the U.S. , had sold 1,000,000 recordings , become No. 1 on Billboard 's list of bestsellers , and made stars out of the recording " artists , " a British group of young men ( 19 to 26 ) called the New Vaudeville Band . Ed Sullivan put them on his show when they arrived in the U.S. on tour recently , and Johnny Carson grabbed them for a Tonight stint . Even Walter Cronkite , who heard that the seven-piece band was appearing in a New York borscht belt hotel called the Pines , chased upstate after the boys on the day after Thanksgiving to do a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vaudeville Band is just what the name says ; no mod rock ' n ' roll about it . Its members play ordinary band instruments for the most part , but their music warbles like a combination of Spike Jones , Rudy Vallee and the A &; P Gypsies . They sing through megaphones with a quavering quality that is strictly vo-do-de-o-do , wailing about a boy who got dumped by his girl at , by , near or in the Winchester Cathedral : <P> <P> You stood and you watched as my baby left town . . . <P> She would n't have gone far away <P> If only you 'd started ringing your bell . <P> <P> It 's a snappy , melodic tune , made catchier by the sound , which promoters have already dubbed " newstalgia . " That , says Composer Stevens , is " a bit of a revolting phrase , " but accurate nonetheless . The band helps project the same image by dressing up in old-timey clothes ( " early bad taste " ) and lolling around the stage like lazy good-for-nothing aristocrats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Alan Klein , has taken on the title of Tristram , the seventh Earl of Cricklewood . <P> <P> Last week the band was getting an extra push from other recording outfits who have rushed yet new versions of Winchester to the stores . RCA Victor 's group , the Palm Beach Band Boys , is actually a Manhattan pickup combo led by an RCA executive who croons while holding his nose . He must be doing something right .
