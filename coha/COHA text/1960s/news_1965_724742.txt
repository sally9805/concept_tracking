txt The first deeply rooted controversy over the future of global communications by satellite , reflecting the revolutionary implications of using the sky as a mammoth switchboard that ' every country can plug into , is ! scheduled to reach a climax this week or next . The Federal Communications Commission confirmed yesterday that it expected to rule momentarily on who should own the initial American ground stations providing access to relay facilities perched above oceans and continents . While the Early Bird satellite hovers over the mid-Atlantic in readiness for next Sunday 's start of regular live television between North America and Europe , the new and old corporate giants in international communications are battling over economic control of the Crucial terminal points without which a satellite is only a useless piece of orbiting hardware . In layman 's terms the provocative issue might be likened to the business of selling illumination from a ceiling lamp , Who controls the light switch could be more interesting than who owns the bulb . - The Communication Satellite Corporation , which owns Early Bird and which was set up by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeking exclusive ownership of the gateways on earth through which all forms of communication to and from a satellite must pass . The established international carriers , including the American Telephone and Telegraph Company , R.C.A. Communications , Western Union International and International Telephone and Telegraph World Communications , have accused Comsat of exceeding its statutory authority . They have demanded the right to share in the ownership of the ground stations . Three or possibly four ground stations , each asking about $6 million , are projected for the immediate future . The conflict offers the first documentation that'some of the carriers are feeling a mounting uneasiness over whether in assisting at the birth of Comsat they have spawned a child with competitive designs on its parents . R.C.A. Communications and Western ' Union International have suggested that Comsat might be bent on undercutting their role in the international communications business . R.C.A. , moreover , envisioned a future in which the carriers might conceivably become menial messenger boys collecting and delivering messages in behalf of Comsat . The legal irony of the dispute is that the carriers own stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's board of directors . In dealing with the nuances of what has been called an " authorized conflict of interest " the carrier directors abstain from voting at Comsat matters directly involving their companies . In its imminent ruling , the F.C.C. can indorse the Comsat petition for exclusive ownership of the initial ground stations , order some form of joint ownership between Comsat and the carriers or suggest another course of action . Implications of Dispute The controversy over ground stations , which began virtually with the first thought of the feasibility of a communications satellite , is , moreover , linked directly to another question of equal competitive sensitivity . Does Comsat have the right to deal directly with a customer for an international communications circuit and by-pass A.T . &; T. and the other carriers ? Or did Congress intend that Comsat should only make circuits available to the established carriers that , in turn , would continue as heretofore in dealing with the customer ? Whether Comsat should be " a customer 's carrier , " a " carrier 's carried , " or both , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Press submitted an application to the Federal Communications Commission asking for recognition as " an authorized entity for the purpose of buying service from the Com-I munications Satellite Corporation . " The Associated Press was the first organization to take advantage formally of an enigmatic clause in the Communications Satellite Act of August 31 , 1962 . It authorizes Comsat to furnish circuits " to the carriers and to other authorized entities , foreign and domestic . " The law , however , does not define an authorized entity , also known as " authorized user " in contrast to an " authorized carrier . " At the same time , the statute stresses that Comsat must offer its services without discrimination . In Washington there is agreement among communications experts that a flood of applications to qualify as " authorized entities " may come from companies that detect the possibility of getting a lower rate for a satellite circuit by dealing with Comsat than by dealing through a carrier . The Columbia Broadcasting System , which promises to be a heavy user of satellite circuits in connection with its television @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it considers itself eligible to become an " authorized entity " and that the law intended that Comsat should deal directly with parties other " than the Government and common carriers . " C.B.S . has not yet filed any application , however . In advancing its case for exclusive ownership of the initial ground stations , Comsat has said that it alone is free from participation in other forms of international communications , such as the underwater cables or land-based radio relay circuits that up to now have been the technical heart of the business of the established carriers . Comsat said it was in a position to give undivided attention to satellite communication and that this was the best assurance of the prompt and full development of such a system . As part of its contribution to the staggering mountain of briefs and comments on the ground station Issues , Comsat asked , if a carrier were to own a terminal station would it be eager to transmit impartially a competitor 's commercial traffice instead of its owner ? Further , Comsat noted that unlike most of the carrier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equipment that will have to be purchased for the contemplated new ground stations . Moreover , Comsat noted that it now was the United States I , participant in the Interim Cornmunications Satellite Committee , which is charged with development of a global satellite communications system . Fortyfive countries are participants in the committee 's activities and each is authorized to speak with respect to both ground stations in his country and satellites . If the United States is the only committee member lacking in full responsibility and authority to speak for the American ground stations , the leadership role of this country would be compromised in the reality of international negotiations , Comsat argues . The American Telephone and Telegraph Company agreed that Comsat was the best instrument to proceed With the planning and construction of additional earth stations , but said this does " not mean that ownership participation in the initial ground stations should be summarily limited to Comsat . " In proposing that the combined carrier group should gain perhaps a 50 per cent interest in a ground station , A.T . &; T. noted : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might not otherwise , to use satellite facilities along with their other facilities . " Touching directly on the tariffs for satellite use , which is still another volatile issue coming to a head when Cornsat shortly announces its proposed rates , A. T. &; T. observed that there might be " a satellite charge and a separate earth station charge or there might be a single charge , one component of which would reflect the actual cost of operation of the station , including a reasonable return on the investment of the owners . " R. C. A. Communications , which is a , subsidiary of the Radio Corporation of America , has been more precise in its attack on the Comsat bid for exclusive ownership of ground stations . It derided Comsat use of the word " initial " with respect to the stations . Longterm patterns in communications often are inextricably imbedded in the form of initial installations , it noted . If the communications commission denies the carriers an economic stake in the ground stations , according to R. C. A. , the agency would foreclose them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satellite communications . " R.C.A. charged that a practical effect of Comsat ownership of terminal outlets would mean the carriers would have to lease satellite facilities at whatever rates were required to carry the Comsat investment in the stations . If the carriers had ownership interest , on the other hand , such an investment would be eligible for inclusion in their respective broad rate bases and would lead to " economic and rate advantages to the public , " R.C.A. said . While Comsat has been made the darling of the New York Stock Exchange and the older carriers have reported profits , the illusion has gained wide circulation that all is sweetness and light , especially after the precision with which Early Bird was plopped into space just where it was wanted . Yet ' the fact remains that behind the scenes the infighting has been sharp and sustained and with good reason : New patterns for world communications are emerging with a rapidity exceeding expectations .
