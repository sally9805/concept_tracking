If a drunken-driving suspect has enough sense to keep his mouth shut , no policeman can force him to admit how much alcohol he has under his belt . But what if the cop demands a blood sample which will offer the same information , and probably more accurately ? A sample the man must give , said the Supreme Court . And then it buckled down to explaining just why a man , who has a constitutional right to silence , must deliver his own blood in testimony against himself . <P> " We hold that the Constitution does not forbid the states minor intrusions into an individual 's body under stringently limited conditions , " said Justice William Brennan , speaking for the slim 5-to-4 majority that was obviously determined to defend the court 's earlier admonitions to police , urging them to make more use of scientific crime-detection equipment . For that was just what a Los Angeles policeman was doing after a 1964 auto accident , when he caught a whiff of booze on Armando Schmerber 's breath and ordered a doc tor to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objected on the advice of his attorney . <P> Ample Reason . But what about Schmerber 's contention that the whole procedure abridged his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and his Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable search and seizure ? The Fifth , answered Brennan , only prohibits " the use of physical or moral compulsion to extort communications " from a person . It does not exclude the " body as evidence when it may be material . " Lie-detector tests , Brennan went on , might very well be improper because they involve questioning and verbal testimony . <P> As for the Fourth Amendment , Brennan said simply that all searches and seizures are not prohibited-only those " not justified in the circumstances " or " made in an improper manner . " In this case , he said , the policeman who ordered the blood test had ample reason to believe the defendant was drunk . Had he taken time to get a warrant , the evidence might have vanished . Besides , the blood was taken in a hospital , under hygienic conditions . <P> Condition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggestion that the states employ compulsory blood tests in their fight against the growing number of highway deaths . If so , the suggestion was hardly necessary . Many states already employ other methods , such as the drunkometer breathing apparatus . Seventeen have so-called " implied consent laws . " meaning that anyone who drives there agrees to submit to a test of some sort or lose his road privileges . And a bill about to become law in California will give drivers a choice between blood , breath or urine tests . <P> Where such a choice is available , the driver in condition to make it will have to decide on the spot whether he wants the older , more accurate blood test , which is accepted in most courts as reliable evidence , or the breath and urine tests , which may not be as reliable and are more readily challenged by expert witnesses .
