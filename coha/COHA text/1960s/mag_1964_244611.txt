AT Lever Bros. , where it 's in to give brief , breezy names to executives as well as products ( All , Lux , Vim , Wisk , Spry ) , Milton C. Mumford is addressed by colleagues and referred to in company publications merely as " Milt . " Along with the little names , however , go big titles : Mumford , 51 , has been president and chief executive of Unilever 's U.S. arm since 1959 ; last week he became chairman as well , succeeding retired William H. Burkhart . Illinois-born and educated ( University of Illinois ' 35 ) , Mumford came to soapmaking Lever Bros. , ten years ago from towelmaking Fieldcrest Mills . As president , he has followed a Burkhart strategy of not knocking heads with bigger Procter &; Gamble , instead pushing products that Lever has hit the market with first . From Lever 's glassy Lever House in Manhattan , Mumford directs a firm cost control program . While sales increased only slightly to $415 million last year , that program raised profits 25% to $12.7 million-a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or competing Colgate-Palmolive . <P> WHEN bowling was burgeoning a few years ago , the Brunswick Corp . ' s dazzling profits and stock splits were a financial 300-game . But the game 's popularity peak has passed , the industry is vastly overbuilt-and Brunswick has lately been getting mostly gutter balls . Chairman Benjamin E. Bensinger , 58 , fourth of that name to run the 119-year-old company , last week reported a 1963 loss of $10.1 million , largely because Brunswick set aside $15 million to cover defaulted payments on alleys and pinsetters . Trim Ted Bensinger is undismayed . He foresaw the drop and tried to forestall it by diversifying into school equipment , hospital beds and medical supplies , expects such sidelines to lead the way back ; non-bowling products already account for 77% of Brunswick 's $66 million in first-quarter sales . Bensinger also anticipates that bowling will rebound in the U.S. and grow in Europe , where Brunswick has opened 22 centers . Until it does , economy is the order ; Bensinger has even cut his own salary from $210,000 to $115,000.   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
