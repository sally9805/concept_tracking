An armored car , one normally used in the collection of commercial funds , was procured and this car drove into the entrance to a ramp which led from a main traffic street into the basement security area of the police building . Two other automobiles from a basement garage in the police building were placed in the same ramp , effectively filling and blocking that area . Manacled to 2 Policemen The police security guard surrounded the center of this ramp from which a 10 foot wide hallway extended to an inner police elevator . The entire hallway and the ramp area were lined with guards and newspapermen , including television crews and television cameras .

Slayer Runs 5 Steps Oswald had a slight smile on his face and was squinting his eyes against the very bright television lights . He took rerhaps five paces forward when suddenly from a railing where mingled police , newspapermen , and television cameras were banked there was a movement . A man wearing a gray hat and a dark suit , crouching low , ran forward in five mincing steps , raised his right hand carrying a .38 caliber snub-nosed revolver and shoved it against Oswald 's left abdomen just below the rib cage .

Dr. Shires subsequently reported that Oswald 's heart stopped beating about 1 p. m. central standard time ) but he was temporarily revived by manual heart massage . He died , however , 7 minutes after his revival . Ruby has been described by friends , acquaintances , and police as an " extremely nervous , quite unbalanced individual .

Lawyer 's Wife Threatened Droby suddenly turned and ran to an inner office , where he picked up a telephone and called his own home . His wife , Betty , answered the phone and informed Droby that she had just received two threatening telephone calls . " She told me , " Droby said a few minutes later , " she had just received two successive telephone calls from a man with a broken accent who told her ' your husband will be the next to die if he represents Ruby .

Curry said that he was " acutely aware " of the deficiencies which both shootings emphasized . Curry appeared at a hastily called conference in the police building to announce both the death of Oswald and the name of the man who had shot him . Statement by Chief The chief 's statement was terse : " Oswald expired at 1:07 p. m. , C. S. T. " The man who shot him is in custody and will be charged with murder . This man is Jack Ruby or Rubenstein and he is a local Dallas man . This is all I have to say in this matter . " Curry stood with stony face and unmoving lips facing a barrage of calls from his listeners . " What possible excuse is there for this kind of security ? " was one demand . " Why did n't you move this man early today without any public announcement ? " w a s another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ball , " was still another . " Was either one of these murders really necessary ? " was yet another . Walks Out Without Word In the audience which gave these calls were local newspapermen , a number of prominent citizens who had come to the hall , business men , and representatives of Dallas and Fort . Worth television stations . Curry 's normally ruddy face lost a little color . He looked stonily over the room and walked out without a word . A writ of habeas corpus on behalf of Ruby was issued by Criminal District Judge Joseph B. Brown about three hours after the Oswald shooting . Hour Set by Chief Attorneys Thomas Howard and Collie Sullivan presented the writ to Curry and later reported that it is returnable at 11:30 Monday morning before Judge Brown . This incredible moment of murder was staged as a result of a decision made at midnight Saturday by Dallas Police Chief Jesse Curry . He chose the hour after a frantic two-day police investigation , , into the ' sniperassassination of President Kennedy , the wounding of Texas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Dallas Policeman J. 15 . Tippit . Virtually the entire Dallas police had been on duty since noon Thursday . Every man was fatigued and a corps of newspaper men who had gathered in Dallas from the far corners of the United States was equally worn out . Curry and the Dallas police . and federal officers of the treasury and justice departments , had been cooperative in providing information on the Presidential tragedy . This cooperation had not interfered in any way with the investigation but Curry and the others were aware of the special obligation in this tragedy to make information available to the country at large . Asked Delay in Transfer In his reports to the press corps , Curry had been extremely fair and accurate . It was with this background of polite cooperation that the group at large requested Curry not to transfer his prisoner in secrecy . " Chief , we will have to maintain an all-night watch if you decide you will transfer Oswald from the police building to the county jail during the night , " the press group said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us get some rest . " Curry nodded and said that he would confer with county authorities and would make a statement within a few minutes . Shortly after midnight this morning Curry called the press group to his office and said : " I will be perfectly fair with all of you and will tell you now that we are going to move Oswald at 10 o'clock tomorrow morning . My men have been ' work continuously also and some of them are now going to get some rest , too . County authorities are willing to take Oswald at that time and that is now our schedule . " Armored Car Hour Late By 8 o'clock this morning , policemen and the newspaper group were assembling again at the police building . Chief Curry said that he planned to place Oswald in an armored car for the three-quarter mile trip to the Dallas county jail and he said the car was ordered to be ready at 10 o'clock . - Actually this car was an hour late in arriving and it was not backed up to the police ramp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basement exit area in which the Oswald shooting took place was jammed with police and reporters who were permitted there only after identifying themselves individually with their police credentials . Television camera crews were moving lightweight cameras to the basement area even while the armored car was backing down the ramp and these crews were barely ready to begin taking pictures when there was a call , " Here he comes . " How Did He Get In ? The major question that has been raised is : How did Ruby gain entrance to this jail area ? Ruby was a frequent visitor to police headquarters and knew many policemen . It is certain he was well acquainted with the geography of the building and of the basement garage area where the shooting occurred . It is now believed that he came down one of the exterior ramps and joined in the crowd at least , 40 minutes before Oswald was brought down . He stayed in the background until the moment of his rush . Diagram of Oswald Slaying Scene 1.11 tl POLICE CARS NEWSMEN ' ARMORED CAC RUBY SHOOTS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
