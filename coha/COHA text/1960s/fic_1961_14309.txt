The scene is a corner of a cheap dance hall . The time is 1922 , the summer . A brassy band offstage is playing a one-step , loud and fast , couples are dancing . The young men are all badly dressed , except for one group of three . Most of the young men are dressed in the awkward style of the moment or , in a few cases , in very sharp cake-eater outfits . The exceptions are in the group who are Brooks Brothers of the day : three- and four-button suits , buttoned-down collars , saddle straps . The young men are all about the same age  --  between sixteen and twenty-two . The girls are about the same age and younger . At Right there is a stand where soft drinks , candy , and cigarettes are sold and in front of it are the non-dancing young men of both classes , eyeing the talent . The music stops and the dancers stand and mop their brows and the young men lift their elbows to let some air in under their jackets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes to him and says , " No smokin ' . " The Bouncer goes to another young man , who is about to light up , and says , " No smokin ' . You wanta smoke go outside . " A young man rubs his belly against the belly of the girl he has been dancing with , and she slaps him Two young men start a fight and are surrounded by the other young men , and automatically all the girls go to one side and are left to themselves until the Bouncer pushes in and grabs one of the fighters and takes him out . The girls do not get excited by the fight ; it is a not uncommon occurrence . Among the girls there is one who stands out for her beauty and distinction , in spite of her cheap clothes . She is MARY . Among the young men there is one who stands out because he stands alone . He takes advantage of the fact that she is momentarily without a young man and goes to her . His name is JOHNNY . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfriendly ) : Hello , Johnny . JOHNNY Kin I have the next dance ? MARY I have it . JOHNNY The one after that ? MARY I have that one , too . You ca n't dance , Johnny . JOHNNY Well , you said you 'd learn me . MARY But not here . One of the Brooksy types joins them . He is BOB MCADAMS . BOB Hello , Johnny . Mary , have you got the next ? MARY All right . The music starts up and BOB and MARY dance , doing the toddle , while JOHNNY , not sore , but far from happy , goes back to his post at the soft-drink counter and watches the dancers , particularly MARY and BOB . The lights fade down and a voice through a megaphone announces : " Ladies and gentlemen , this dance will be a Moonlight . " The lights go down except for a sickly moon at Centre . CURTAIN p. 4 Act 1 , Scene 2 SCENE TWO It is the interior of the McAdams Iron &amp; Steel Company plant . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps half-way up , is the entrance to the plant , and on either side , extending all the way to the arch , is a high fence , behind which are visible stacks and cranes and roof-tops that are part of the plant . Over the open gateway is an arch on which is painted MCADAMS IRON &amp; STEEL CO.  --  BRIDGE &amp; STRUCTURAL SHOP . Men are sitting on the ground , their backs leaning against the wall , and other men are playing catch , two or three actually having catcher 's mitts and pitcher 's gloves . Two others are pitching quoits . Two older men , smoking pipes , are playing cards . Each man has a lunch pail near him or in his lap . They are all grimy and in work clothes . One of the ballplayers is JOHNNY ; one of the men sitting against the fence is BOB . JOHNNY is obviously a good ballplayer . WORKMAN Johnny , you gon na pitch Sunday ? JOHNNY I guess so . ANOTHER WORKMAN Hey , Johnny , I heard there was a scout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe , I do n't know . SECOND WORKMAN ( incredulously ) : You do n't know ? p. 5 JOHNNY It do n't make no difference .

WORKMAN It ai n't your old man , it 's your old lady . I hear she wants you to be a priest . JOHNNY ( half humorously ) : I do n't have no vocation . ( Here MARY walks by , carrying a large basket of groceries . She knows what is going to happen . It happens . The men notice her in various ways . A few of them whistle : " Root-te-toot , root-te-toot , " in time to her steps . Another says , " Hyuh , Mary . Gettin ' much ? " Another repeats the question . Another : " How about a date , Mary ? " Another : " Hey , Mary , you wanta go pickin ' huckleberries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They admire her . She expects to be whistled at . She says , " Hello , Johnny Hello , Bob Hello , Les Hello , Jake " to those she knows and makes a lightly contemptuous face at the others . When she has disappeared one workman says , " How 'd you like to dip your socks in her coffee ? " Another says , " I 'd give a week 's pay to have a piece of that . " Another says , " Hey , McAdams , that ought to be something for you , " to which BOB replies : " I would n't mind , " to which the first speaker says , " You never did ? " to which BOB says , " I do n't think anybody ever did . " To which another man says , in the then current slang , " That 's what they ALL say . " Here the end-of-lunch whistle blows and the men start going back to work . JOHNNY lingers. ) p. 6 JOHNNY ( to BOB ) : Hey , McAdams . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BOB All right .

BOB That 's how old I was when I started dancing school . JOHNNY Oh . You went to a school for it . BOB Every God damn Saturday , till I went away to school . JOHNNY It took that long . Other guys it did n't take that long . BOB It does n't take that long . You could learn in a couple of hours . p. 7 JOHNNY Could you show me how ? Lunch hour , could you show me ?

You could learn it in no time . JOHNNY ( disgustedly ) : Athlete . BOB If I could pitch a drop like yours  --  well , I 'd still want to dance .

He is a man in his thirties , extremely well dressed , blas as a man in a custom shop can be . During the conversation that ensues other sales-people cross the stage as they presumably leave for home . The men among them give MARY the eye , say good night to her , and among them are a couple of boys of the Wanamaker cadet corps in their blue caps and jackets , white breeches and canvas leggings . The boys say " Good night , Miss Stewart " , indicating MARY 'S change of name from Stukitis . The name of the Redleaf salesman is RALPH KIPLINGER . When he saunters over to MARY 'S shop , and through part of the ensuing conversation , she is taking trays of candy out of the display cases and putting them away . RALPH Do you want to go home first ? MARY Uh-huh . RALPH That suits me . I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend of mine , the auto salesman ? p. 13 MARY Uh-huh .

Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ad-libbing time steps . The pianist is improvising in the manner of Rube Bloom . A rather tired blonde with a still good figure is smoking a cigarette indolently , standing aloof from the others . The operation seems to be in charge of a man named BILLY BRADFORD , a fat queen of young-middle age . BILLY All right , you terribly talented people . We do the Newport number . The piano starts up and the boys and girls , who are all in rehearsal costume , do a dreary society-type song-and-dance , the lyric sung by the blonde , who is named KITTEN CLEVELAND . During the number BILLY shouts at the dancers : " You , Blanche , get your canetta into it , dear . Charles , stop camping . We 're gon na play Shamokin and they do n't like uth there . They do n't underthtand uth . Allan , do n't you know right from left ? " During the number JOHNNY has entered the hall unobserved and watches fascinated while the number is being done .

Where did I know you ? JOHNNY You did n't know me , but I sent you the , uh , enrolment fee , the ten dollars . BILLY You sent me ten dollars ? JOHNNY When I answered the ad . You said to send you ten dollars enrolment fee . KITTEN Wait a minute . Are you looking for the Jack Weston Dancing Academy ? JOHNNY Yeah . Is this the wrong floor ?

JOHNNY That 's for registering your name so you can get jobs , after you complete the course . BILLY Oh . You had any show business experience at all ? Can you dance ? Do a time step for me . JOHNNY I do n't know what it is . I won a lot of cups but I never had no lessons . BILLY What were the cups for ? JOHNNY Ballroom dancing . BILLY Just for the fun of it , dance with Miss Cleveland .

JOHNNY Fine , as soon as I learn the steps . BILLY Do you know what a tab show is ? No , you would n't . Well , our production is what they call a tab show . You might say it 's a condensed version of a Broadway musical comedy . p. 21 KITTEN ( warningly ) : Equity . Equity . BILLY I 'll charge you the same money as Jack Weston would , only I 'll get you experience right away , at the same time . JOHNNY I do n't get it . BILLY You do n't ? I 'll tell you what I 'll do . I 'll let you rehearse with us , or watch us , and I 'll give you the same instruction course you 'd get from Jack Weston . You have the money on you , do n't you ? JOHNNY Yeah , I just got here .

You give me fifty dollars now and then at the end of next week , when we open at one of the big New York theatres uptown , another fifty . And then if you 've lived up to expectations I 'll take you on the road with us . That 's the best experience you can get , you know . On the road . Where you staying in New York ? JOHNNY I guess I 'll go to the Y.M. BILLY All right . You be here at ten o'clock sharp tomorrow morning and we 'll start . Okay ? p. 22 JOHNNY Sure , I guess so .

BILLY That 's all the excuse you 're gon na need . All right , you can have him . KITTEN Well , just to keep him away from you . BILLY Big of you , dear . Big of you . Now let 's see . After the Newport number you and I need some jokes , some funnies . Now what can we steal ? Did you happen to catch Cleo Mayfield and Cecil Lean a couple weeks ago ? p. 23 KITTEN I thought we were gon na be Julia Sanderson and Frank Crumit . BILLY Watch your billing , dear . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I want you more on the order of Mayfield . Frank and Julia , they do n't get the laughs the way Cecil and Cleo do .

The first good job I got I sent her the money . All her life she always wanted a phone , but my old man did n't want no phone . And he was right .

Well , one of them , but everybody always has trouble with her , and it do n't mean anything . She squawks if it rains , and she squawks if it do n't rain . What are you doing , Bob ? I guess I should know , but I do n't . BOB I just started working downtown . Wall Street . JOHNNY Bond salesman ? BOB That 's the idea . There 's nothing for me at the mill .

But what chance would you have in a place that size , with I do n't know , a thousand , two thousand clerks . But if it'da been anybody it'da been Mary . You know , Bob , I never told anybody this , but there does n't a day go by without me thinking of Mary .

MARY You can be sweet , I 'll admit that . JONES Well , I should think you would admit it . MARY Did you make a lot of money today ? JONES Yes , I made quite a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ? How much ? JONES More than your job pays you in a year . MARY Good . Then I 'll buy you a present . JONES I do n't want a present . The best present you can give me is  --  let me relax . MARY All right , relax . JONES If you really want to give me a present , I know one you can give me . MARY Quit my job . p. 33 JONES Exactly . MARY No . JONES Why not ? You have plenty of money , and you get just as tired as I do . That 's why we have these spats . You walk around all day , taking off dresses , putting on dresses , taking a lot of guff from fat slob women . And you do n't eat enough . MARY If I ate more I 'd get to be one of those fat slob women . Then you 'd start looking for another Mary . JONES ( sincerely ) : No I would n't . You 're my girl , and you know it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same old place . You 're never going to get a divorce and even if you did I would n't marry you . I would n't marry a divorced man . It 's against my religion . JONES So is having an affair with me against your religion . I know . I have a Catholic friend . I know quite a bit about your religion . MARY You do n't know anything about it . But I 'm not quitting my job . As long as I have my job I 'm all right . It 's the same to me as your wife and family are to you . JONES Well , I guess I ca n't argue that . MARY I 'll get older and they wo n't want me to model any more , but by that time I 'll be a vendeuse. p. 34 JONES A what ? MARY A vendeuse . Do n't they teach French at Harvard ? JONES God damn little to me , I must say . MARY A saleswoman . JONES Oh . MARY Or  --  I 'll get married . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if you knew what that does to me , when you say you 'll get married . You will . You 'll get married . You ought to . According to everything that 's right , and decent , and that I was brought up to believe . You know what kind of a man I 've been , I 've told you often enough . I 'm not very proud of myself as a husband . As a father I guess I 've been all right , but not as a husband . But nevertheless when you speak of marrying somebody , it 's like a punch in the guts that I was n't expecting . I realize how much you mean to me and how little everybody else has ever meant . I 've been happier with you than I 've ever been . And any thought of your not being in my life Do you realize that , Mary ? MARY Why do you think I 'm here ? JONES ( with an attempt at humour ) : Because one day I stopped at Wanamaker 's , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Act 1 , Scene 7 SCENE SEVEN The top of a Fifth Avenue bus , number 1 to 5 . BOB MCADAMS is sitting alone in one of the front seats . It is , of course , one of the old open-top buses . He is letting the wind blow on his face . The bus stops , we hear the conductor 's signal , and the bus starts again . MARY , who has boarded the bus , appears at the back end . At first she thinks she is alone , but then , seeing MCADAMS , whom she does not recognize from the rear , she takes a seat half way up toward the front . MCADAMS , enjoying life , turns around and sees first , a girl , then , recognizing her , MARY . BOB Hey , Mary ? MARY Who is it ? Bob . Bob McAdams ! BOB This is swell . How are you . Come on , sit with me . Where are you headed for ? MARY Home . BOB Home ? I thought you lived in Philadelphia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to date . Do you live in New York ? BOB Sure . I 've been living here almost a year . Do you know who I see all the time ? Johnny Antonelli . Johnny Anton , of course . MARY I saw him in his show . p. 36 BOB Did n't you go backstage ? I have a lot of friends in the show , thanks to Johnny , of course . But he 'd be disappointed if he knew you saw the show and did n't go back . MARY I could n't . I was always with somebody . BOB You say always ? MARY I 've seen it three times . BOB You better not let him find that out . What are you doing , I mean have you got a job ? MARY Yes , I 'm a model . BOB Where ?

BOB Yes , I was going to say she lost her head . Stewart , eh ? Well , that 's not so far from Stukitis . MARY It 's about as far as Lithuania to Scotland . p. 37 BOB ( laughing ) : Not bad . Listen , you 're not married or anything , are you ? MARY No , I 'm still single . How about you ? BOB Oh , me ? Marriage is the farthest thing from my thoughts . MARY I 'll bet . BOB Well listen , Mary , how about dinner some night ? If I call you up are you going to be busy for the next six months or would you like to reminisce about the old home town ? MARY Any time . BOB How about week-ends ? MARY ( suspiciously ) : What do you mean ? BOB Well , next Sunday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two friends of mine and we have a cocktail party almost every Sunday . MARY Week-ends I 'm almost always free . BOB Well good , how about this Sunday ? I 'll get Johnny to come . MARY Oh . Well , I do n't know . BOB Why ? Do n't you want to see Johnny ? MARY Well , you do n't have to have him on account of me . BOB You 'd rather he did n't come . p. 38 MARY Well  --  I would n't have much to say to him . BOB Okay , we do n't have to have him . You come , and then you and I go some place for dinner . MARY All right , fine . I 'd like to go out with you . Talk . BOB Swell . And not just once or twice , huh ? MARY Well , there 's one thing , though , Bob . I 'm liable to break a date at the last minute . BOB Who does n't ? MARY Well , I just do n't want you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong . I do n't delude myself that you 've been sitting here in New York waiting for good old Bob McAdams to take you out . MARY Sixty-fourth Street . I get off here . Are you in the phone book ? BOB East Thirty-seventh Street . Any time after five-thirty . CURTAIN p. 39 Act 1 , Scene 8 SCENE EIGHT A large room in the Hotel Astor , the night of the Beaux Arts Ball . The room is crowded with people in costume , notable especially for the dcolletage of the women . There is a makeshift bar , attended by bartenders , but there are scarcely any chairs , not enough to seat a fraction of the people . The door up Centre is open most of the time , and when it is closed it gets opened by the curious , the tight , the misdirected , or the invited . A man is playing the piano . The people in this party range in age from college boys to men well in middle age , but the women are mostly young . GIRL Whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , uh , Socit de Ecole des Beaux Arts Architects . Anyway , it 's the Beaux Arts Ball . Does that help you ? GIRL No , I knew that much . I mean this party , where we are . BOY Oh . You mean this party . I do n't know . GIRL Because actually , I do n't know a soul . BOY Hell , I do n't even know you . GIRL Oh , well . ( Her tone implies , " Let 's fix that . " She kisses him and they embrace warmly. ) p. 40 ANOTHER BOY ( in white flannels and white shirt , with a red handkerchief around his head ) : What are you supposed to be ? THIRD BOY A pirate . ANOTHER BOY Yes , but what pirate ? THIRD BOY Billy the Kid . ANOTHER BOY No . Billy the Kid was a cowboy . THIRD BOY Are you sure ? ANOTHER BOY I 'm almost positive . THIRD BOY Then what am I ? ANOTHER BOY Why do n't you be an Indian ? THIRD BOY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be having the pageant . YOUNGISH WOMAN Oh , really ? Why ? OLDER MAN Because it 's time for it . I have to get down there , Mrs. Menken would never forgive me . YOUNGISH WOMAN You 're fried . There is no Mrs. Menken . OLDER MAN I 'm speaking of Mrs. S. Stanwood  --   --  Oh , Lord , every year , every year . Hello , Denny . JONES Hello there , Crownie . Miss Stewart , Mr. Crowninshield . Pronounced Crunchel. p. 41 CROWNINSHIELD Any relation to Will Stewart ? MARY No relation to any Stewart . CROWNINSHIELD Oh , yes . A nom de guerre . MARY A nom . I do n't know about the de guerre . CROWNINSHIELD Speaks French . How nice , my dear . Nice accent . MARY I learned it at school . CROWNINSHIELD Lausanne ? Genve ? MARY St. Mary Star of the Sea , Gibbsville , Pennsylvania . CROWNINSHIELD I must run . Pageant . Committee , y'know . Au vwah . ( He pats MARY 'S bare arm . ) See you later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who that was ? MARY Sure . JONES You know more people in this town than I do . MARY No . I just do n't know the same people . JONES I 'm not any happier about that than you are . MARY I did n't say I was unhappy . Just a statement of fact . You have your Racquet Club friends , and I have my friends . p. 42 JONES You 've met most of my Racquet Club friends . MARY But not their wives . JONES You would n't like them , the wives . MARY What makes you think I like the husbands ? Dull bunch of bastards . JONES ( loyally ) : Well , I 'm one of them . MARY I 'll say you are . JONES ( hurt ) : Mary , we came here to have a good time . You wanted to come , I did n't particularly . I do n't any more like quarrelling in the midst of a party than I would making love . Look at those two . ( Indicates the first boy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . JONES ( after a two-count , helplessly ) : Would you enjoy it ? MARY I do n't know . I do n't know what I 'd enjoy . JONES I 'll get you a drink . Would you like some champagne ? MARY I do n't want a drink . A drink is n't what I want . JONES Yes it is . I know these moods . I 'll get you a good stiff highball. p. 43 MARY You do n't know these moods , and I do n't want a drink . JONES smiles patronizingly and leaves her . She is standing alone and JOHNNY enters , first unseen by her , but then as he moves through the crowd she sees him , joyfully , then JOHNNY sees her . MARY Johnny ! Johnny ! JOHNNY , slightly tight and on the prowl , full of confidence nowadays , goes quickly to her and they embrace , then she takes her head away without removing her arms , then she kisses him in an unmistakably abandoned way , and together they push through the crowd and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , still in some of his Beaux Arts Ball costume , is asleep in an armchair . It is dawning , not yet full day-light . A whisky bottle and glass are on the coffee table in front of JONES 'S chair . The door of the apartment opens and MARY enters , wearing a man 's trench coat buttoned all the way up . She sees JONES , looks at him for a moment , then takes off the trench coat and hangs it in the foyer closet , revealing herself still in ball costume . She goes off and comes back , now divested of her costume and wearing a dressing gown , and carrying a large glass of milk , which she puts on the coffee table in front of JONES . During the action he stirs a little , then when she puts the milk on the table he wakes up but does not get out of the chair . JONES Hello . MARY Hello . JONES You been home long ? MARY No . JONES ( rather pitifully ) : The dance still going ? MARY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) : Ten past six . What happened to you ? I turned my back to get you a drink and the next thing I knew you were gone . p. 45 MARY I know . You better drink some of that milk . JONES Where did you go ? MARY Who cares ? JONES I care . I care a great deal . I did n't say anything to get you sore at me , not that sore . MARY I was fed up , and I left . JONES What were you fed up with ? MARY Drink your milk . I got fed up because  --  I 'll tell you why I was fed up . Whenever I get the blues you say , " Have a drink , that 's what you need . " Till I started going around with you I never knew the taste of liquor . Now I drink all the time . Drink does n't solve any problems for me . Maybe it does for you , but not for me . JONES We do n't drink enough to do us any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a meal without a drink , and pretty soon I 'll be just as bad . JONES Who brought you home ? MARY I came home alone , in a taxi . JONES ( relieved but unsatisfied ) : You came home alone ? MARY Ask the doorman . You better get some sleep . You have to go back to Philadelphia today . p. 46 JONES Have you been to bed ? MARY ( sticking to the literal truth ) : I only got home a little while ago . Anyway , I 'm not going to work today . I got the day off , I knew how late we 'd be up . JONES ( clinging to the hope that things are okay ) : I must look pretty silly . There 's nothing worse than fancy dress in the daytime . MARY ( picking up whisky bottle ) : You through with this ? JONES Yes . Not permanently , of course . MARY Oh , I know that much . I want to put it away so I do n't have to look at it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last night . It 's pretty hard going for both of us . MARY I 'm glad you realize that . JONES Realize it ? I think about it all the time . But I must have been pretty obnoxious . You never actually walked out on me before . You go to bed . I 'll sleep out here . MARY All right . Good night . JONES ( goes to her and kisses her gently ) : I wo n't wake you up when I leave . p. 47 MARY Thanks . JONES I 'll be in New York Tuesday and I 'll call you then , but I 'm not spending the night . Wednesday I 'm coming over again and I will spend the night . MARY All right . JONES I 'm sorry about all this . I love you . You know that . MARY Yes . JONES Oh , and call Zimmermann Monday morning . I want you to get out of that stock . You 've made about four thousand dollars out of it . MARY Have I ? JONES Yes . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more about it when I see you Wednesday . MARY When am I going to be able to spend some of this money ? JONES When your account gets to fifty thousand . MARY That 'll be never . JONES It 'll be sooner than you think . Why , do you need money ? MARY No . JONES I wish my wife would say that , just once . ( It is exactly the wrong thing for him to have said , and he almost immediately realizes it . ) MARY Well , good night , or good morning . p. 48 JONES Good night . Oh , will you take the costumes back to Brooks ? MARY ( wearily ) : Sure . CURTAIN p. 49 Act 2 , Scene 2 SCENE TWO JOHNNY 'S apartment , brand new , tubular modern . He is in the process of showing it for the first time to BOB McADAMS . JOHNNY Well , here it is . BOB ( looking about ) : Boy ! JOHNNY Johnny Antonelli on Park Avenue . Who'da thunk it . Like the piano ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you get drunk you do n't have far to fall . BOB Boy . This makes our place look like the stockyards . You must be making more money than I thought . JOHNNY They tore up the contract . I got an offer to dance in a supper club , it would have paid me an extra five hundred bucks a week , but Sid Harrison , you know , manager of our show , he said he 'd give me three hundred if I did n't take any outside offers . So I said sure . But when the show closes my price goes up . I got an offer of a show next season . You ever read The Vanity Fair ? BOB The book or the magazine ? JOHNNY The magazine . BOB Sure . JOHNNY They 're gon na have an article about me . With pictures . I saw the article . It says I combine Jack Donahue and Fred Astaire . They 're crazy . Those two guys know more about dancing than if I lived to be a hundred . You ever watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say I was camping . p. 50 BOB I guess it 's because you 're new , they have to compare you with somebody . JOHNNY You 're right . I never thought of that . ( Looks about him . ) I 'll say one thing for show business . If I'da had my other ambition I would n't have a joint like this . If I was a rookie pitcher I 'd be lucky to have two rooms . I bet Lefty Grove , Carl Hubbell , financially I 'm better off than they are . BOB When are you going to christen the place ? JOHNNY You mean with a party ? In a couple weeks . In another way it was christened already . BOB Anybody I know ? JOHNNY Yeah . Yeah , you know her  --  you know . I 'd rather not say . BOB Check . Well , as they say in Harlem , I got ta take a run-out powder . Good luck in the new apartment , Johnny . And I 'm proud of you , you deserve the whole thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sort of parody of the Fred &amp; Adele Astaire business of dancing on the furniture . The justification for the dance is in the previous speeches and the reason for it is to consume time while BOB is going down in the elevator and leaving the building . At the end of the dance JOHNNY smiles and shakes his head negatively in a kind of mute tribute to Astaire . The doorbell rings and MARY is admitted . p. 51 JOHNNY ( shyly ) : Hello , Mary . MARY Hello , Johnny . They do not go to each other , he is taking his cue from her , and she is carefully not inviting an embrace . MARY I brought your trench coat . JOHNNY That 's all right . I 'm just glad you came . But thanks . A few minutes earlier and you 'd have seen Bob McAdams . MARY That would have been great . JOHNNY I thought you liked him . You used to . MARY I do like him . But JOHNNY Can I get you anything ? MARY A match . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you this instead of a match . It 's gold . It has my initials on it , but I can put from in front of J. A. MARY No thanks , Johnny . You keep that . JOHNNY Are we gon na see each other , Mary ? I know I 'm seeing you now , but you know what I mean . MARY ( looking at the end of her cigarette ) : It all depends on how much you want to , Johnny . p. 52 JOHNNY Well , I 'll tell you how much I want to . Outside of you there 's only two things in the world I care about . One is dancing , and the other is baseball . But if you said the word I 'd quit dancing , I 'd never go to a ball game , and I 'd go back home and get a job in the mill , if that would make you happy . MARY ( nodding ) : I had an idea that was the way it was . I just wanted to make sure you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to JOHNNY What happened the other night never would have happened back home , would it ? MARY Not between you and me , no . JOHNNY But I was always in love with you back home , and I never been in love with anybody else . You know what , Mary ? MARY What ? JOHNNY I never even told anybody else I loved them . MARY Never ? JOHNNY I know what you 're thinking . You 're thinking sometimes a person has to say it , even if he do n't mean it . I never said it . You know how I got around it ? MARY How ? JOHNNY I 'd say to them , " Baby , do you love me ? " p. 53 MARY What if they asked you the same question ? JOHNNY ( suddenly shy about his amours ) : I do n't like to talk about that . MARY ( teasingly ) : Come on , what did you say ? JOHNNY Well , that all depended . If I was in  --  like if I  --   --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes . If I was  --  in bed with one . I 'd have to say something nice . Would n't I ? MARY I think you ought to . What did you say ? JOHNNY You mean how did I get around saying I loved them ? MARY ( good-humouredly ) : Quit stalling , Johnny . JOHNNY Well , if she asked me did I love her , sometimes I 'd say , " How can I help it , baby ? " MARY ( laughing ) : You dog . JOHNNY Or I 'd say , " How could you ask such a question ? " Inferring , you know . MARY Mm-hmm . JOHNNY ( after a two-count ) : What about you , Mary ? p. 54 MARY You 're going to want to know everything , are n't you , Johnny ? JOHNNY Yes . I could say no , but I 'd be lying . MARY There 's somebody now . JOHNNY Well , I was sure of that . Pretty sure . One , huh ? MARY Only one that has any claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? MARY Well  --  nearly three years . JOHNNY What is he , married ? MARY Married , and has a daughter as old as I am . JOHNNY The son of a bitch . MARY No , he 's not a son of a bitch . JOHNNY What else is he ? Does he sleep with his wife ? If he does , he 's a son of a bitch . What 's he doing for you ? MARY I never asked him to do anything for me . JOHNNY You have a job , you work . He is n't marrying you . And I 'll bet he do n't spend Christmas Day with you , or take you out with his friends ' wives . You show me where he ai n't a son of a bitch . MARY If I thought he was a son of a bitch it would n't have lasted three years . p. 55 JOHNNY Then I tell you what you better do , Mary . You better forget what I said . You better hold on to him .

I told you I 'd bring my sister in . Well , here she is . Jean , this is Mary Stewart . MARY I 'm glad to know you . ( To BOB ) : I 'm not supposed to have conversation with the customers . ( To the attending saleswoman ) : Is the boss around ? SALESWOMAN He did n't come back after lunch . BOB He ? I thought the boss was somebody named Elise Brennan . MARY ( smiling at the saleswoman ) : Elise Brennan is a man . SALESWOMAN Ooh , and what a man . If you know what I mean . BOB You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Innocent little Jean . SALESWOMAN I 'll leave you . But do n't sit down in the dress , Mary . MARY ( to JEAN ) : Do you want to see anything in particular ? p. 57 BOB Show her everything . Alimony , Mary . Big settlement . Alimony . Do n't you get a commission ? MARY I split with her , the vendeuse , if I bring in a customer . But do n't you buy anything here . I can get anything you want twenty per cent off . JEAN Oh , no , thanks . You 're entitled to your commission . The others in the shop conveniently leave . MARY I 'll be back in a minute . ( She goes off to change her dress . ) JEAN Her father works in the mill ? BOB He died a couple of years ago . JEAN You 'd certainly never think she ever lived on Slag Hill . BOB She lived at the bottom of Slag Hill . But her mother was quite a woman . She made Mary finish Catholic High , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she is n't married ? BOB Not married , but there 's somebody . JEAN She 's being kept ? BOB I do n't know for sure . She 's got somebody , but she keeps on working . JEAN The somebody is n't you , I take it . p. 58 BOB Listen , do n't think for one minute I would n't . But I never got to first base . JEAN You know , boys are lucky . Just think , now you used to know this girl , because Daddy made you work in the mill , and that 's how you knew Johnny Antonelli . Oh , I 've got to meet him . BOB You 're going to . JEAN I 'd like to see that show every night I 'm in New York , just for him . BOB Do n't count on brilliant conversation , because brilliantly he does not converse .

JEAN It 'd be almost too perfect if the two best products of the mill ever got together . BOB Yes , they pulled two good heats when they pulled those two . JEAN Is that some new dirty slang I have n't heard ? BOB If you knew more about the mill you 'd know what pulling a heat means . JEAN I 'm sorry , but it sounds more like kennel talk . p. 59 BOB ( laughing ) : So it does . MARY ( re-entering ) : Are you going to be in New York for a while , Miss McAdams ? JEAN Officially it 's Mrs. McAdams Robertson , but I wish you 'd call me Jean . After all , we grew up together , even if we did n't know it at the time . MARY Thanks , I will , Jean .

JEAN Shall we stay around and buy a lot of things ? MARY Oh , he 'll stamp his foot but I 'm not afraid of him . JEAN How would you like to have lunch with me tomorrow ? BOB Oh , come on , Jean . Are n't you having lunch with Jonesey ? Jonesey 's a girl from Philadelphia , as dull as anything the Main Line ever produced , and that 's covering a lot of dullness . Do n't expose Mary to that .

JONES ( stuffily ) : I think they used to say that when I was a boy . Blessed event . I 'm sorry I did n't get here yesterday , but I had to go to that funeral . MARY I know . JONES Jack Wellworth . It 's getting so I hate to look at the obituary column . Somebody I know always in it . Not necessarily friends of mine , but I 'm always recognizing names , do n't you know . You 'd have liked old Jack . MARY Would I ? JONES He was a close friend of mine . One of my ushers , I was one of his . I guess Jack was as close to me as any man I ever knew . I could tell him anything . p. 62 MARY Did you tell him about me ? JONES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hope you do n't mind . He 's dead now . You see , Jack had somewhat the same problem . MARY Problem ? Am I a problem ? I guess I am . JONES Problem was an unfortunate choice of words . What I meant to say , Jack was in love with someone other than his wife , and Nancy , his wife , would n't give him a divorce . MARY Did he ask her ? JONES Did he ask her ? I do n't know that he ever actually put it to her in so many words , but it would n't have done him any good if he had . Not Nancy . MARY He just took it for granted . JONES Well , the way you do . A man gets to know his wife pretty well . He can pretty well tell whether she 'd give him a divorce or not . MARY Yes , and sometimes it is n't worth going to all that trouble . Is it ? JONES Are n't we getting pretty close to home ? Are you being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Denny . A year or so ago , but not any more . p. 63 JONES You told me time and again you did n't want to marry me . Would n't marry me . But now , today , honestly dear , you sound very bitter . MARY Do I ? JONES Everything I say is wrong . You have a quicker mind than I have . I 've found that out . MARY That 's because I 'm a Lithuanian . They say anybody that can learn to read and write and speak our language has to have more brains than most people . JONES I believe it . MARY Take a seat , Denny . JONES I 'll do that little thing . I have a favour to ask you , and I do n't want to be standing up if you say no . And the mood you 're in , you 're liable to .

I 'd like to have some cash , and I know you have close to twenty thousand . Would you let me have about fifteen of it , for say two weeks ? MARY Why not ? JONES Why not ? Because it 's your money , and this would be a loan . I 've just heard of something that sounds awfully good , but I have no cash to speak of . I could unload some common stocks , but I hate to do that . If you let me have the money I can almost guarantee you , well , at least a twenty-five per cent profit in  --  say two months . p. 64 MARY Take the whole thing , I do n't consider it my money . JONES But it most certainly is your money . It 's all in your name . MARY The only money I consider real money is what I have in my savings account .

I know two of the partners and the floor man , and my firm 's been doing business with  --   --  MARY I 'm trying to tell you something , Denny . I 've been trying ever since you came in .

JOHNNY is a little tight and having a wonderful time with JEAN , dancing with her , when he espies MARY , also dancing but not very cheerful . MARY and JEAN smile at each other in friendly fashion , but JOHNNY 'S face darkens when he sees MARY 'S escort . JOHNNY Is this him ? MARY What did you say , Johnny ? JOHNNY ( contemptuously ) : The one I said was a son of a bitch . MARY It 's none of your business , Johnny , but no , it 's not the guy .

Last Monday we only had four . Tuesday we had five . Wednesday matine , we had six , but that was all women . Wednesday night His gabble is lost in JOHNNY 'S entrance in white mess jacket , black trousers , wing collar , the costume he wears in the finale .

JEAN It 's going to be at my brother 's apartment , East 37th Street . I 'll write it down for you , and his name is Robert McAdams . MILTON Oh , I know Bob . So do most of the girls in the line . JOHNNY Will you keep your big trap shut ? JEAN ( amiably sarcastic ) : Yes , do n't disillusion me about my brother .

MARY comes out from the kitchen , picking up the hat as she goes through to the bedroom , offstage , sees that it and the bathroom are empty , then comes back to the living-room and stares at the window . She crushes her hands to her stomach , then slowly forces herself to go toward the window in the midst of sounds of a couple of offstage voices shouting in horror . She goes almost to the window , then some sense of delicacy mixed with horror keeps her from the unnecessary act of looking out and down . And in her pity she covers her face for a second , then falls to her knees and makes the sign of the cross . p. 73 CURTAIN p. 74 Act 2 , Scene 8 SCENE EIGHT BOB 'S flat , afternoon of the same day .
