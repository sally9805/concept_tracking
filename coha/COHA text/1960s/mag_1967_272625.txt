Benny Boudreaux , 40 , from the bayou country of Louisiana , lost the use of his legs from an injury to his spinal cord in an auto crash while he was in the Air Force . Like most of the 1 00,000 U.S. paraplegics ( both legs disabled ) and quadriplegics ( both arms and legs disabled ) , Boudreaux was constantly prey to excruciating decubitus ulcers , better known as bedsores . In the Veterans Administration Hospital in Memphis , he was condemned to lie in bed , face down , so no bony prominences could cause pressure and ulcers . <P> Boudreaux wanted to do metal work , but he could not reach a workbench from a wheelchair , and anyhow , he could not sit on the ulcer at the base of his spine . He had heard about stand-up beds and tilt-tables-so why not convert a wheelchair into something similar ? Therapist Robert E. Craig and Dr. Hodge M. Eagleson Jr . worked with Boudreaux in perfecting a sort of surfboard-wheelchair combination . <P> Last week Dr. Eagleson told the American Congress of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surfboard is made from two pieces of plywood hinged together and covered with foam rubber . The bedsore patient lies on it face down , with his legs at an angle of about 20 from the vertical , and the upper part of his body only 25 to 35 from the horizontal . In this position , patients on surfboards can read and eat more comfortably . Their old bedsores heal without surgery , and new sores do not develop . Boudreaux has perfected his board to the point where he can work as a TV repairman and even winch himself into a pirogue to go duck hunting .
