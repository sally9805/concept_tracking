txt Are you being stopped from buying a house because you ca n't sell the home you own now . A growing number of Americans are solving this financial problem by trading in their homes , much as they trade in their cars , to the dealers who sell them other ones . Such tradeins are boosting sales of new and old houses around the country . In a typical trade-in a broker or builder agrees to buy a customer 's house at a price usually 10% to 20% below its appraised value , by a fixed date . Meanwhile , the customer can try to sell the house for a higher price on the open market . In return , of course , the customer agrees to buy another house from the broker or builder . Second-Time Buyers The trade-in trend is being spurred by current sluggishness in housing sales in most sections of the nation and also by a change in the housing market in recent years .

Mal Sherman . a Baltimore realtor , cites the case of a clothing salesman with a wife and three children who recently admired a threeyear-old , seven-room house in a Baltimore suburb , The house was listed by Mr. Sherman 's firm at $13,900 . " This guy wanted to buy the house , but he 'd been trying for six months to sell an older house he owned , had n't been able to and did n't have money for a down payment , " says ' Mr. Sherman . " I offered to take his house in trade and we closed the deal . " Because the family was eager to move , Mr. Sherman took over the older house immediately . He deducted $1,500 from the appraised value of the house , $9,500 , to cover commission , financing charges and costs of maintenance until he can resell it .

Traders Club Grows The increasing popularity of trade-ins is reflected by the growth of the International Traders Club , an organization for brokers who are interested in home trade-ins . Membership in this Chicago-based group has increased to 4,023 from 2,084 in 1959 and 959 in 1956 . " Eventually trade-ins are going to become a large part of our residential business , " says C. Jerome Lombardo , executive vice president of C. B. Snyder Realty Co. of Hoboken , - N.J. Calvin S.

Some brokers are joining forces to help finance their trade-in operations . Eight brokers in Mt . Lebanon , Pa. , a suburb of Pittsburgh , have formed the Cooperative Trade-In Corp . and received a $100,000 line of credit from a local bank . Fast Action A. C. Brickell , one of the organizers of the trade-in corporation , explains : " This placed us in a position whereby the minute we decided that we were going to allow so much for a piece of property we could immediately act upon our decision . We would no longer be subject to the whims of a bank or a mortgage or building and loan association , or confined by FHA or VA appraisals . " To aid trade-in sales , the 1961 Federal Housing Act gave Federally chartered savings and loan associations the right to invest up to 5% of their assets in unamortized loans to build-era and brokers on trade-in properties . Borrowers are required to make only semiannual interest payments until the note is due . Such loans may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's appraised value , for up to 18 months  --  which is usually enough time for the broker to resell the house . Although brokers could previously borrow on trade-in houses for up to 15 years , they were required to make semi-annual payments on the principal as well as interest . " This gives the builder and realtor a little more room for maneuver , " says F. N. Howard , vice president of the First Federal Savings &; Loan Association of Peoria , Ill . That association has loaned $2.5 million in the past six years for trade-in financing . Some brokers foresee a big growth in intercity trade-in business , particularly from employes of large corporations who are frequently transferred from one city to another . " This market has a tremendous potential , " says W. I. Berman , who heads a Pittsburgh real estate firm bearing his name . Mr. Berman tells of a young executive , transferred from Pittsburgh to Campbell , Calif. , who lacked the money for a down payment on a house he wanted to buy . His real estate broker in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Pittsburgh house appraised . Then Mr. Berman assured the executive of a set price for the house if it could n't be gold by the time he took title to the home in Campbell . The Campbell broker and Mr. Berman advanced the executive the cash for the down payment on the Campbell house and shared the commission on the pale . And when Mr. Berman eventually had to take over the house in Pittsburgh , he and the Campbell broker split the holding costs until the house was sold . To be sure , in a few sections of the country where good houses are still in short supply , trade-ins have been slow to catch on . That 's because demand is strong enough to let an owner make a profit on his home by selling it himself . But in most areas , according to a ' recent Wall Street Journal survey , prices on new and old houses are weaker today than at any time in recent years . Brokers report that houses are taking longer to sell and that many owners are being forced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . - As a result , many brokers say they 're finding it easier to convince trade-in customers that they 're being offered a fair allowance on their bid homes . Says Pittsburgh 's Mr. Berman : " Real estate price . have reached a plateau . Owners are becoming more realistic about accepting a fair appraisal . " Risks for Brokers Of course , taking houses in trade can he a risky business and most brokers and builders try to avoid building up inventories of trade-in houses . " We encourage the buyer to list his house with a reliable broker in his area , " says an official of Douglas Lowell , Inc. ? a Portland . Ore. , builder . " If he can sell it before his new home is completed , he 'll save any money he receives above our guarantee figure . " Stewirt B. Matthews , senior vice president of Baird and Warner , Inc. , a Chicago realty firm , says : " About 80% to 90% of the time the trade-in properties are liquidated ( in the conventional way ) before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But a Pittsburgh realtor says one broker in that city was " too optimistic in appraising houses . As a result , he had four or five homes he took in on trade and he lost money on each . It 's a matter of knowing your market . " The Federal Housing Administration says trade-in programs have led to some speculative abuses . According to the FHA , some home owners have been trading small equities in their old houses as down payments on new properties , without being released from liability under their old mortgages . If the broker in such a deal ca n't sell the house in a few months he sometimes stops making mortgage payments , permitting the leiader to foreclose on the property . To curb this practice , the FHA recently revised its commitment procedure in cases In ? volving trade-ins . Under the new regulations the FHA will not insure a new mortgage for a trade-in customer who already is liable for ? mortgage on another home in the amount of more than 71% at the Original principal .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
