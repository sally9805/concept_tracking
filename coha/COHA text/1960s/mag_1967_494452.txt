A New Leader For the Orchestra Question : What would the world look like today if we had n't been deeply involved in Vietnam ? Walter Lippmann : I think what would have happened , first of all , is what President Eisenhower said would happen , namely Ho Chi Minh would be the president of a united Vietnam , which would be a communist country in which the forms of communism would vary perhaps from what they are in Yugoslavia or in Bulgaria or in Rumania , but essentially there would not be a free-enterprise capitalist system . General Motors would not be able to operate freely in Vietnam . In my opinion , it would be anti-Chinese ? in the sense of being against Chinese expansion , in a military sense . And it would not have been very anti-American . . . . If that had come about , the collaboration with the Soviet Union , which was well started in 1963 would have gone on , I think , quite a ways . On the whole , the world would be very much better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be far higher than it is today . Q : Mr. Lippmann , Swedish economist Gunnar Myrdal said recently that he felt the worst thing that could happen in Vietnam would be for the United States to win . He felt that US prestige would suffer immeasurably if indeed we did win the war in Vietnam . . . . Do you think he 's right ? Lippmann : Well , I think he was sort of talking with his tongue in his cheek , because there 's no such thing as " winning " in Vietnam . It 's absolutely inconceivable . . . even if we suppose that Ho Chi Minh said , " I surrender , and I will come to Washington , or to Honolulu , wherever you like , and you dictate your terms . " Suppose that happened . That would be winning , the way we won the war against Japan in the Second World War . But it would n't be worth anything , because five years later Ho Chi Minh will be dead , and do you think that the Vietnamese are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Impossible to imagine it . Q : Many people have compared the present situation to Truman 's situation in 1948 . Lippmann : I know this tendency to say , " Now this is 1948 , and President Truman was very unpopular too , and yet he won the election in spite of all the commentators and the polls and everything else . " Well , I do n't think , myself , that it is like 1948 . President Johnson is in the position that Herbert Hoover was in . Hoover had the Depression on his hands , and nothing he was able to think of or do could get him out of it . The country finally turned over and got rid of him ... and yet they elected a man , Franklin Roosevelt , whose last month of the campaign was made entirely on the same platform as Hoover 's . He said he was for all the things that Hoover was for . He reversed it 6o days later , when he got in . If there 's a parallel or analogy , the analogy is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Q : Might n't the analogy be with 194o , if we 're really going into a wider war ? Lippmann : I think we 'll undoubtedly do more bombing , and we 'll send more troops , and so on , but I do n't see how that 's going to save the situation politically . The assumption that the country is going to get sufficiently enthusiastic about this war to support the kind of unanimity of war time ? I do n't think that assumption is sound . The war is the most unpopular one that I 've lived through in my own life . I wo n't count the Spanish-American War ; I was a child then . Q : You say President Johnson 's very unpopular , and it seems to me that his one chance for getting reelected is to be in the midst of a wider war by the time the election comes around . Lippmann : . He 'll do a lot of things to be reelected , but he wo n't plunge this country into the Third World War . He is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you to the claim made by the government that people who think we ought not to be in Asia are neo-isolationists ? Lippmann : When I say we ought not to be in Asia , I mean we ought not to be there with an army . There 's a difference between being in Asia as a trading nation , a cultural nation , and , if you like missionaries , and all that , and being there with an army , on the ground .... Never before in our history has any President said that this was a good thing to do . Q : Should we let the President follow whatever options he wants , or should Congress set some limits ? Lippmann : Neither . . . . Our system of government is a presidential system . Which means , really , not whether the President has power to do this or that , the Congress this or that , but that the whole tone of American life , even down to private life , is set from the Presidency . He 's the leader of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an orchestra that a poor leader ca n't . Q : What about some of the concertmasters like Dean Rusk , and Walt Rostow , and McNamara , and maybe McGeorge Bundy , who 's been in and out what do you think of them , and what 's their role in the formulation of our foreign policy ? Lippmann : Let 's start with Rusk . Rusk is a very sincere man whose education stopped about 1944 . What he learned in 1944 , and which was formulated for Franklin Roosevelt by Secretary of State Cordell Hull , has remained gospel for him . Everything that has happened since - the whole of China and the whole of Asia has gone through a revolution - has n't affected him at all ; it 's still the same old thing applied to the original Second World War concepts . And those concepts - namely , that you fight aggression , and if you win the battle , then you have peace , eternal peace ... that all was invented in the First World War . Cordell Hull learned it there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dean Rusk and to President Johnson , who have accepted it as if it were the eternal truth , that you fight wars against aggression and thereby end war . Q : Is n't Rusk 's rationale , really , that aggression .. . does n't occur as often , if you meet it head-on ? Lippmann : Well , now , look at the record . This is the third war against aggression we 've fought , within even your lifetime . We fought the Japanese to prevent aggression , and we dictated peace to the Japanese , and disarmed them , and that ended aggression . Did it ? Not at all . . . The example of Japan did n't make one bit of difference to the Korean War . Q : Are you saying that war should never be an instrument of a country 's foreign policy ? Lippmann : I think war should be an instrument of national policy , yes . But it should n't be an instrument of a universal dream . . . . Q : What 's Dean Rusk 's relative importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the others that we 've mentioned ? Lippniatin : I think his big role is that of the stern father or the voice of God ; he 's the conscience of the President . The President tends to be more easygoing . . . . He backslides , and I think Dean Rusk is the stern voice there . Q : Dean Rusk has said twice now that he wo n't testify before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in open session . Lippmann : Well , if I were Dean Rusk , I would n't want to testify in an open session , either . I mean he ca n't possibly have a good day ; he can not submit to the kind of questions that he 's bound to be asked . . Take the fundamental precept on which the whole Rusk pyramid is erected , that there are two Vietnams and one of them invaded the other . There are n't . There is only one Vietnam . We are pretending that there is a country known as South Vietnam which is run by the South Vietnamese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The United States has intervened in a civil war , and that is a mistake . Q : I wonder if you could elaborate on the ideal that the war in Vietnam could end , but that it could n't end as long as Lyndon Johnson is the President . Lippmann : What I mean to say is that Lyndon Johnson has committed himself personally and before the world and before the American electorate to an objective in Vietnam that is in my view unattainable . He wants an anti-communist , anti-Chinese and pro-American regime in Saigon . Q : Are n't most Republicans who would be his possible opponents more or less committed to the same view ? Lippmann : Some of his Republican opponents , if you ask me , are just as benighted as he about the whole thing . They believe things that were true of the war in Europe 25 years ago , but are not true of this war . Q : Well , then who 's going to be this Republican candidate that 's going to beat Johnson and extricate us from Vietnam ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he goes on the way he 's going , will beat himself . He 's got into a position from which he ca n't get out , just as Hoover did in 1932 . Hoover could n't go out in public ; the crowds were fierce ; his credibility gap was just like Johnson 's ? nobody believed a word he said . Q : Do you think we 'll get another Republican like Eisenhower in Korea , you know , who went in and ended the Korean War right away ? Lippmann : I think the war will be gotten out of in the term of the next President of the United States . Q : Whoever he is ? Lipprnann : Yes , whoever he is . Q : Not including Lyndon Johnson . Lippmann : If Lyndon Johnson is reelected , I do n't know what would happen . I really think the country would be in a very dangerous condition . Q : Do you have an opinion about which of the Republican contenders is most likely to get us out ? To want to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who ought to be the next President is Rockefeller , and I 'm for Rockefeller not because I think I know exactly what he thinks about Vietnam or whether I agree with what he thinks about Vietnam . I 'm for him because the great problem is what we do inside this country , which is in a mess , and I think Rockefeller is the ablest candidate in either party for dealing with our internal affairs . . . . A nation , and especially a democratic nation , is not capable of having two great goals at once ? fighting a war in Vietnam and rebuilding the American society at home . One will get in the way of the other . That has happened , as a matter of fact , in my lifetime : three times this country has started on a program or a trend of real internal social reform and three times the thing has been interrupted by war . The reason that our cities are in such a mess is that this is a neglected problem . It 's been neglected for over 5o @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all should be given to the government 's argument that it can pursue two wars at the same time ? Lippmann : None whatever . . . . Q : If there were no Vietnam war , would the War on Poverty have succeeded ? Lippmann : The problems of poverty and the race problem and so on , are not in themselves soluble within the visible future . What you can get is the feeling of momentum among the people , white and black . . . . Kennedy did n't solve any of these problems ; but he gave the people the feeling that he was on his way , and what they do n't have now is any feeling that we 're on the way anywhere . Q : Many Negroes in the country are suggesting that there is a Negro solution to ghetto problems , and it seems as though Negro leadership is becoming more militant in the sense that they are insisting on a Negro solution to what were largely American solutions to the Negro problem in the ghetto . Lippmann : Well , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it leads , if you carry it far enough , to a system of apartheid . But this country is irrevocably committed to living together , to being a biracial or multiracial state . It 's impossible to segregate . There 's no way you can cut off Mississippi and Alabama and say , " That 's a Negro state . " That solution is out , ruled out from the beginning , in this country . Now I have a great deal of sympathy with a great many things I read by some of the Black Power advocates , because they are really advocating self-respect and do-it-yourself and financing your own thing . That , I think , is all to the good . Q : . Suppose you assume a different factual premise : namely that it 's an obvious fact that Negroes and whites in American society today are in separate communities , not only in Alabama and Southern counties in Mississippi but in the large cities in the North , and from that extrapolate the view that the Negro leadership is taking now ? that our direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't solve the problems of the Negro community and rather than fight the battle on the integration-segregation front , take for granted that American society is segregated and then build the community , the Negro community , into a viable and competitive partner in the American society . Lippmann : Did you say " partner ? " Q : Partner in the sense that it 's coexistence between the Negro and white communities . Lippmann : Why should n't it be better than that ? Q : But is n't a militant Negro leadership dealing with the problem as it is , and the American mentality as it is ? Lippmann : Insofar as it 's dealing with it psychologically , in the sense of giving courage and self-respect to Negroes to do their own thing , I think it 's all to the good . But it 's not solving the problem , because the resources are not there in the Negro community to solve the problem . There 's neither the resources there nor the numbers . So that , in the end , it 'll have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't make partners of a mass of people ignorant on both sides . You 'll have to make partners of educated people first . Q : You might educate the nation through confrontation : namely , if the Negro poses a great enough threat to the national security , simply because he is a threat , we will learn about that threat . Lippmann : Yes , but you 'll get a backlash from that which will be something terrible . Q : Well , it would be temporary , though . Lippmann : No . . . The question is can the Negro community , acting on its own resources and by its own willpower , force the nation to solve the problem of the Negro . That , I think , is impossible . Q : Are these the worst times there 've been in your lifetime ? For the country ? Lippmann : Yes , I think so . I 'm more worried about the state of the country than I think I 've ever been before . And it 's not because I 'm afraid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that . What I see is the disintegration of hope and belief and will willpower and morale . That 's what 's bad . Q : Most of us are a little bit too old to be hippies and maybe a little bit too young to understand them ; did you see in other generations anything at all similar to the hippie phenomenon ? Lippmann : Well , similar , yes . After the First World War , everybody was terribly disillusioned and disappointed because Wilson 's great dream of eternal peace had failed , just as they all fail , that kind of dream . And there was a great exodus from this country . That 's the Form it took . The young intellectuals , the writers ? they all wanted to get to Paris or some to London , but mostly to Paris . That was the escape . Q : Was there ever a period in your life when you had felt that kind of , you know , disillusionment ? Lippmann : No , I do n't think so . I like to fight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't believe in saying the game 's up and I 'll take a drug and be out of it . Q : You said that you thought the reason the times were very bad now was because of a kind of disintegration of hope . Do you see a way out of that ? Lippmann : Yes , you have to have a new leader for the orchestra , who will suddenly begin to make the rhythm go again . The thing is there in this country . Sometimes a country is in the mood to solve everything ; those are its great periods . The Elizabethan Age was that kind of age in England , and the New Deal in the early thirties was that kind of an age , and John F. Kennedy 's was beginning to be and the Great Society in the first months of Johnson was that kind of age . That 's the thing you 've got to have : what would be the equivalent of an Elizabethan Age in America , when people hope and believe and are willing to fight , and do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going to win . . . . I mean , if you 've seen hopes raised and dashed as many times as I have , and always because a war has intervened , you 'd say , " Well , now , for heaven 's sake , we ca n't wait any longer . " We have the riots and all that , we have worse than that ? we have despair and deterioration . That has got to stop . We 've got to have a people that believes it 's going to do something .
