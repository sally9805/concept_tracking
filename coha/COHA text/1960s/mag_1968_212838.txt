To aid their endless search for water , oil and minerals beneath the surface of the earth , prospectors and scientists have used everything from divining rods to sophisticated seismic devices . But more often than not , they have had to fall back on costly and time-consuming drilling to probe the earth 's secrets . Now , New Mexico 's Sandia Corp . has developed new tools for preliminary subsurface exploration that may do in minutes or hours what now takes days and even months to accomplish . The new devices : high-speed , instrumented projectiles dropped from aircraft or propelled by rockets . <P> The projectile probes , developed by Sandia engineers in the course of nuclear-weapons research for the Atomic Energy Commission , operate on a simple principle : the deceleration of a projectile as it penetrates the earth is determined by the material through which it passes . A projectile penetrating loose to medium-dense sand , for example , will be slowed down more quickly than one passing through soft clay . <P> Antenna Tail . To determine the behavior of objects penetrating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terradynamics " - engineers have used projectiles weighing from 5 Ibs. to 6,000 Ibs. that strike the earth vertically at speeds of from 41 m.p.h. to 1,870 m.p.h. , depending on the drop altitude and method of release . Some are merely shoved out of airplanes or hovering helicopters ; others are dive-bombed or rocketed to boost their velocities . The best penetrators , Sandia has found , are pencil-shaped missiles of heavy metal that are at least 8 to 10 times longer than their diameters . Some have plunged more than 200 ft. into the earth . <P> Before the projectile hits the ground , a small parachute tucked into its hollow tail is released , pulling out a long wire antenna . As the projectile pierces the earth , a small , insulated accelerometer responds to the sudden impact and subsequent slowing by producing a voltage that varies with the rate of deceleration . The voltage is amplified and transmitted through the antenna , which , unfurled , is long enough to remain extended above the surface . <P> Anchor Planting . Picked up by a receiver above ground , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ v. depth curves that are characteristic of the substance and structure of the soil that has been penetrated . Sandia engineers are already able to tell when the projectiles have passed through materials Ifke sand , silt , clay , water , mud and certain kinds of rock . <P> Sandia 's earth-probe projectiles have been proposed to investigate the suitability of remote sites along Colombia 's Atrato River for the location of dams . Eventually , in addition to a role in mineral exploration , the projectiles may be used to find water , to place deep-sea anchors , and to bury radioactive fuels re-entering the atmosphere after the flights of nuclear rockets . Shot from unmanned spacecraft orbiting distant planets , one Sandia scientist proposes , the projectile probes could even help determine if there are water tables beneath the surface of Mars and Venus .
