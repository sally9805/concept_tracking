THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment SS the press releases pour into our office , we sometimes lose track of why it is that the organiza-tions sponsoring them are so scrupu-lous about confirming them in the flesh . Do they think that unless we travel to some distant hospitality suite to hear it said live we might not believe that Best &; Co. marches in the vanguard of fash-ion , or that the next I.Vorld 's Fair will surpass ( is it possible ? ) the last , or that the National Secretaries Association ( International ) , with its twenty-five thousand members ( descendants of Egyptian scribes ) , whose average an-nual salary is $5,678 and whose edu-cational level is high and ever higher , is worthy of our respect ? Now that we think it over , though , there 's no doubt that we would have missed something if we had just sat here reading those blood-less releases instead of heading for the Princeton Club , as we did on a recent Tuesday , for the National Secretaries Association symposium " Operation Update @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bulletin distributed at the door and reporting that " chief executives of major companies throughout the country " who were asked to rank ten attributes of a good secretary valued secretarial skills above judgment , loyalty , initiative , diplomacy , appearance , ability to make decisions , cooperation , punctuality , and flexibility , there were no sensational revelations . But the words of Mrs. Margaret Lawson , Certified Professional Secretary and last year 's International Secretary of the Year , made our trip worthwhile . " There is one constant , " Mrs. Lawson said , toward the end of a discussion of the secretary ' s past , present , and ( cybernetic ) future . " The secretary of yesterday , tomorrow , and today will he , has been , and is a humanizing influence . " The star speaker , who was Malcolm Baldrige , president of the Scovill Manufacturing Company and this year 's International Boss of the Year , could only agree . Auspicious Crane MARCH came in ( as advertised ) like a lion , but Japan ' Week blew into town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Air Lines ) like a crane . The crane is the symbol of japan Air Lines , and , by a strange coincidence , the high point of New York City 's japan Week celebration , which ran from February 28th to March 7th , was the dedication in the Grand Army Plaza of a scale model of a fourteenth-century Japanese castle known as Tsuru-ga-jo , the Castle of the Auspicious Crane . We went up to Fifty-ninth Street and Fifth Avenue on the first of March to take a look at the mini-castle and to talk with the man responsible for its construction , a young Japanese designer named Kimio Komu do . IATe found h 'm hard at work in the ballroom of the Plaza Hotel ; already the room 's white-and-gold Louis XVI dknr had been partly buried under an avalanche of Japanese lanterns , artificial wisteria , and paper cherry blossoms . Mr. Komoda  --  thirty ) cars old , thin as a cherry bough , nervous as a wisteria branch  --  did not speak English , so Miss June Kawai , a representative of Japan Air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creating a floral arrangement for a Japan Week dance to he held that evening for the benefit of the Children 's Aid Society . Mr. Komoda 's sleeves were rolled up ; at his feet were paper sacks of crushed white marble and wooden crates of polished black stones imported from Japan ; on a table in front of him were cardboard cartons of fresh flowers and green shrubs and a stack of cut-glass sherbet bowls to whose undersides had been glued black-painted round metal cake trays . As we watched , Mr. Komoda picked up a handful of iris stalks , stuck them into a metal bolder in the bottom of a sherbet bowl , added sprigs of greenery and some paper cherry blossoms , heaped the edges of the tray under the bowl with white and black stones , and stood back to admire his improvisation  --  which , Miss Kawai explained , was based on the principles of the ikehena school of flower-arranging adapted to American tastes and the materials at hand .

The wind was howling down out of Central Park , and we circled the model Tsuru-ga-jo and its adjoining ornamental garden at a brisk pace . Seeing us shudder inside our overcoat and muffler , Mr. Komoda smiled and spoke to Miss Kawai , who translated for us : " He says it 's not so cold . When they were putting up the castle during the last two weeks , he was covered with snow three times . " Mr. Komoda went on to say , through Miss Kawai , that the model , which rises sixteen feet to a five-tiered central tower , was constructed to a scale of one-twentieth . The original , a fortified palace with two protective moats and an elegant interior , was built in 1384 in the northern Japanese prefecture of Fukushima and has been restored twice . Guided by photographs of the original taken by Mr. Komoda , a team of workmen in Tokyo put the model together in forty-two days out of wood and molded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shipped in thirty-two large crates to San Francisco , and there transferred to trucks for the trip to New York . Mr. Komoda , who had come here briefly last September to inspect the site , supervised the erection of the model in front of the Pulitzer Fountain . Because of union rules , five Japanese workmen who accompanied him were relegated to advisory positions , and taught local carpenters the ins and outs of Oriental wood-joining techniques . The model was a gift to the people of New York from the people of Japan Air Lines , Miss Kawai explained , and the purpose of Japan Week was to symbolize the friendship between New York and Tokyo , which have been official sister cities for seven years , and also to mark the inauguration of Japan Air Lines ' around-the-world jet service . It is now possible to take a Japanese plane from New York to Tokyo in either direction , she said . We made one last circuit of the castle and its garden , and then retreated to the hotel and its Palm Court , which had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mr. Komoda . There , over coffee , we asked him how he had happened to become a multi-threat design man . He mid that he was born in a Buddhist temple in Shizuoka , sonic hundred and fifty miles southwest of Tokyo , where his father was a priest of the Nichiren sect . While training for the priesthood himself , in a succession of religious schools , he developed a secret interest in drawing and modern art , and when he graduated from college , at the age of twenty-three , he told his father that he wanted to go to Tokyo to work for a large design company . At first , he said , his father and mother had been very unhappy , but now , especially since he had been chosen to design the model of the Castle of the Auspicious Crane and given the honor of coming to New York to supervise its erection in the Grand Army Plaza , they had begun to feel that things were n't working out so badl ) after all .

OO VERHEARD in a corridor of the N -- / Federal Courthouse , edgy stroller to friend : " I told you you should 've got yourself some legal advice before running to a lawyer . " Sampling Air WE walked cast from Columbus Circle at nine-thirty the other morning on our way to a technical briefing by a member of the city 's Department of Air Pollution Control . The air felt fresh , but the sky was overcast , and though luminous patches could he seen here and there , the cloud covering deepened to a brownish slate color near the tops of buildings . Cam and buses puffed exhaust gases , and a diesel truck rumbling by added a dark effluvium of its own . Street puddles were iridescent with oil . Ahead of us , the Queensboro Bridge appeared as a spectral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its almost Gothic towers looked like gargoyles . The previous day had been one of heavy pollution , and , for all the feeling of freshness in the air , the sky did not augur much improvement . At Fifty-ninth Street and Second Avenue , on the traffic island at the point where vehicles leave the Quecnsboro , we approached a wooden shack that serves as a monitoring station for the Department 's Bureau of Laboratories . Our briefing officer , a short , brown-mustached man named Herbert Gilmont , who is one of the Bureau 's assistant chemists , was just getting out of his car in front of the shack . He was wearing a blue overcoat and a Hack cap , and when he saw us he said , " Hi ! I 'm making the downtown route today . I usually make the uptown route , but the downtown man is sick , so I 'm filling in . Come on in and survey the damage . " We followed Mr. Gilmont into the shack , and as he turned on an overhead N light we saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one wall . A device embedded in another wall was humming softly , and against a third wall was an empty workbench . Mr. Gilmont said , " We used to have an infra-red analyzer here , and a hydrocarbon analyzer , too , but they 're both on the fritz . " He walked to a small wooden cabinet on which " NO2 " was painted and opened its door , revealing some glass bottles and tubing and a metal turntable , from which a number of plastic test tubes hung . He removed the test tubes , each of which contained some liquid , and began to replace them with empty tubes . " See thisF " he said , pointing to a cylindrical glass vessel . " It 's an impinger . The nitrogen dioxide in the air is absorbed by a dilute solution of sodium hydroxide in the impinger and then agitated for an hour . NO2 comes mainly from automobile exhaust . We 'll measure the amounts of pollutants later , up at the lab . " ? Ve asked him what sort of damage nitrogen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the death rate , " he said laconically . He closed the cabinet 's door and walked to another cabinet , on which " SO2 " was painted . Its interior turned out to he similar to the first cabinet 's , and Mr. Gilmont said , " Sulfur dioxide . It comes from the burning of coal and fuel oils . Its levels in this area are about the highest in the country . " " What does ii do ? " we asked . " Oh , it irritates the respiratory tract , too . Sort of eats things away , " he said . " In the air , it can turn into sulfuric acid . " Temporarily silenced , we watched Mr. Gilmont work at the sulfur-dioxide cabinet . When he had finished , he went to the humming device embedded in the wall and threw a switch on an electric curd . The humming stopped . He slipped a small , round piece of filter paper out of the device . " Air has been drawn through this for just one hour , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out white . " Holding the paper between two fingers , we saw that its color was identical to that of a charcoal-gray flannel suit we used to own . We handed it hack to Mr. Gilmont . He removed a tape from something called a smoke-shade sampler and then , carrying his test tubes and other samples in a small box , left the shack and went out to his car . Vie followed him outside and gut into the car beside him . " New York is incredible , " he said as he started the car and began driving up the approach to the bridge . " Did you " Then , Your Royal Highness , after presenting my credentials to Secretary-General U Thant , I proceeded to Pier 74 , at Thirty-fourth Street , and the Hudson River , to reclaim my limousine . " ? ? know that there 's never anything that could be called pure , fresh air outdoors in New York , at any time , at any place , no matter how strung the wind is blowing , no matter how blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The only place you 'll find pure air in New York City is in the sealed environmental chamber of some laboratory . " His voice had risen , but it dropped again as he said , " We 've got some improvements coming in our department . For one thing , we 're going to increase the number of monitoring stations from nine to dna ) - seven . Ten of them will relay information telemetrically to a central office . The lab is uptown now , but it 's going to move down to Cooper Union sometime soon . We 've just started testing for carbon monoxide on a regular basis , instead of merely making spot checks , and we plan to do the same for metals and hydrocarbons . We expect to increase our staff  --  instead of ten chemists we 'll have forty and we hope to do a lot of research . So the picture is n't all black . " As the car moved across the bridge , we could look out over Queens and Brooklyn , both of which lay under a brindle haze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ravenswood plant were all emitting smoke , and as we rode into Queens we saw the squat smokestack of a laundry sending up copious fumes . Mr. Gilmont pulled up before a firehouse on Forty-seventh Avenue . Inside it was a monitoring station similar to the one we had just seen . He checked its instruments and then drove to a third station , in the Polytechnic Institute ? of Brooklyn , where he checked some more equipment . His last stop of the morning proved to he a station on top of the thirty-one-story Sheraton Whitehall Building , at 17 Battery Place . We stood in the wind on the building 's roof for a moment , looking out over the Harbor . New Jersey was wrapped in an umbral shroud , and smokestacks along its docks and piers sent up thick gray-white columns . Most of Manhattan was covered by a dark , seemingly motionless pall . Though we could make out the Statue of Liberty as a two-dimensional image , the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge had all but vanished into the murk . Mr. Gilmont decided to have lunch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Department 's laboratory , on the second floor of the Harlem Court House , at 121st Street and Sylvan Place . We arrived there a little early and found several chemists working at some complex electronic devices . One of the chemists invited us to look around , so we walked past a couple of scintillation counters , gazed at a Coleman Spectrophotometer , and finally stood fascinated before an apparatus on top of which two glass tanks were bubbling with what we ? could have sworn was grape juice . At about four , Mr. Gilmont arrived , carrying his samples in a couple of large boxes . " Oh , hello there ! " he said . " I 'm just going to titrate the SO2 . Come on over this way . " He established himself in front of a thin glass tube that was clamped in a vertical position on a metal stand , squirted a red substance into some of his test tubes , poured the contents of one test tuhe into a flask , and turned a spigot on the thin glass tube @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Now watch , " he said . " When the liquid hi the flask turns green , we 've reached the end point . " It turned green . He began to record the levels of sulfur dioxide in the city 's air during the previous day . The worst hour , it soon appeared , had been from 11 A.M. to noon . When he had tested the sample from the Fifty-ninth Street station for that hour , he exclaimed , " Boy , that 's pretty high ! Wow ! One point one- parts per million ! Wow ! The highest I 've ever seen is one point two . If the SO2 ever reaches five parts per million , that 's the toxic limit . " " The toxic limit ? " we asked . " Yep , " he said . " At that point , everybody just goes to sleep . " MARCH 11s 19 ( 07 We thanked Mr. Gilmont for all his hospitality and , having made our way past retorts and cuvettes and other arcane objects , walked down a flight of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begun . Cars and trucks were lined up at the nearest intersection , their exhaust pipes puffing mightily . As we left the crowded intersection and headed hack to our office , the sun sank slowly into the mist . Round Trip AYOUNG woman who works in a hank has told us she was approached the other day by a matron who asked , " Are you the young lady who sold me traveller 's checks about a month ago ? " Our friend replied that she may well have been , since she sells a great many traveller 's checks every day . " You 're the one , all right , " the matron concluded . " I remember you . I just thought I 'd stop hack here and tell you what a wonderful time I had in London . " Hat REMEMBERING that this year is the tenth anniversary of the collaborative hat-dropping of Michael Flanders and Donald Swami , we recently paid a late-morning visit to Mr. Flanders ' New York suite , on the ninth floor of the Buckingham Hotel . Mrs. Flanders , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is five , greeted us at the door of the living room and then briskly retired to the next room , Laura leading the way . In the living room , we found Mr. Flanders sitting in his wheelchair and Mr. Swann curled up on a couch . " Doll hospital , " Flanders explained , circling about in the wheelchair . We sat down and , turning to Mr. Swarm , expressed our admiration for  --  and curiosity about the method behind " Drop of a Hat " humor . " We 've been described as a cool medium with maximum involvement , " Swann said , by way of preliminary explication . Flanders pivoted his wheelchair so as to fix his partner with a gaze of infinitely benevolent disdain . ( We recognized the look  --  a convention of their theatrical relationship . ) " Swann himself has been described as ' all forehead , ' " he said , and , after pausing for about three seconds , went on , " I used to say that we 'd made a careful analysis of American culture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Swann having studied Mighty Mouse and Secret Squirrel . But we dropped it . People did n't seem to know who Secret Squirrel was . " We said that we did n't know who Secret Squirrel was , either , but that we had noticed that a number of New World herpes do have corresponding initials . " Why , that 's so ! " Swann exclaimed . " First time I realized that ! " " Typical , " Flanders said . " Whole point of the joke . " We asked Flanders how the " Hat " jokes were written , and he said that they were n't written at all . " Oh , I carry a grubby half-sheet of paper to remind me of ideas , " he went on . " But we 're an oral , not a written , thing . There is n't any show , really  --  or , rather , the show is everything . I just speak new material . I had a transcription made . You know , I read it in absolute horror and agony . Utter tripe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through thousands of subordinate clauses . It was like one side of a telephone conversation . Yet , experimenting onstage , you have a priceless thing . You can finally find the one delivery that 's right  --  a slightly longer pause , perhaps , or one word changed for a synonym  --  and all that meaningless twaddle seems to rearrange itself properly . " We asked how much calculation enters into this rearranging process . " There 's a story about three comedians who worked together , " Flanders said , rapidly maneuvering his wheelchair around several square yards of floor , in what was roughly equivalent to pacing . " They had one fantastic gag , and each claimed it was what he did that got the laugh . So , to settle the argument , they decided that each , in turn , would change what he had been doing . The first night , the fellow whose routine was to hit one of his partners hit differently . No one laughed . The second night , the fellow who got hit behaved differently , and no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood by and watched reacted differently . Again , no one laughed . So they decided it was a combined job . " Swann nodded vigorously , in grave affirmation . " The point is that the gag was finished , " Flanders concluded . " It never got a laugh again . " We said we wondered whether intellection was n't always inimical to humor . " I think I 've found the instinctive way best , " Flanders replied . " At any rate , worrying over a line is the one sure way to kill a laugh . Of course , there are still sonic things one must think about . In some places , our accents present a sticky problem . Not so much in New York , but in Louisville , for example , we sound more foreign and we must watch our cadence when we 're being tongue-in-check . Britons have quite a different cadence when they say one thing and mean another . But then irony 's always dangerous . Been misunderstood since Swift 's day . " We began discussing songs from " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deemed ironic , and when the talk turned to the one wholly non-funny piece in their repertoire  --  an astringent ballad about the equivalent of twenty tons of TNT allotted to every man , woman , and child on earth  --  we asked about the criticism sometimes made that the tenor of their humor might he overly gentle . " I suppose we formulated our initial political thoughts at the end of the thirties , " Swann answered . " It was an era of passionate belief  --  in Communism , or Socialism , or whatever . We reacted against all that , you see ; we set about breaking down fanaticism . So when we see extremes , we laugh at them  --  even when we see them in ourselves . I happen to he a convinced Christian pacifist . But we do n't simply shout that . Instead , I say I 'm a reluctant cannibal . Michael wrote the song , but it was a joint thought , really : I wo n't eat people . Eatin ' people is wrong . ' " What we work for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Flanders said , wheeling himself over to a desk and rummaging through some papers . " We 're not doing cabaret , after all . The political scene is too transitory . Out of date before the print is dry . We do n't sing about the news as such , but we do try to treat larger changes in feeling . We do remark on the foolish space race , or nuclear stockpiling , or the fact that two-thirds of the world is starving while the remaining third is on a diet . The best quick satire , really , is the all-out myparty-right-or-wrong sort of thing . We do n't do that . " Swann began nodding again , and curled up deeper into the couch . " There 's been so much bitterness , " he said . " If you 're still sitting and laughing , people accuse you of understatement . " " Ah , here it is , " Flanders said , pull-
