IN their handling of Philip Roth 's celebrated new novel , Portnoy 's Complaint , the nation 's editors and reviewers faced one of modern journalism 's increasingly recurrent challenges to taste and sensibilities . The problem was not how to judge the book ( with few exceptions , critics called it a masterly novel of the Jewish genre ) , but how to convey its sexual content and earthy language without using THOSE WORDS . <P> The Chicago Sun-Times circled warily , citing Roth 's " generous use of the saltier nicknames for our reproductive organs and their congress with one another . " In the New Republic , Critic Anatole Broyard tried arch humor , calling the book " a sort of Moby Dick of masturbation . " Many newspapers and magazines fell back on tradition , using initials and dashes for familiar obscenities . Considering its usual soberness , the New York Times Book Review surprised its readers by permitting its reviewer to repeat verbatim some of Portnoy 's sex-obsessed plaints . <P> Chickened Out . The decision of whether or not to print words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not just go away . Four-letter words , and elaborations on them , have become a tool of protest politics and almost de rigueur occurrences on stage , in movies , in books and in the public vocabulary of many celebrities . <P> One of the stickiest problems arose when the Government-sponsored Walker Report on the violence in Chicago during the Democratic National Convention repeated the obscenities shouted at Chicago police . Ben Bradlee , editor of the Washington Post , decided at first to run the report without deleting the offensive words . " But when the story came up from the composing room and we saw all those words in cold print for the first time , we chickened out , " he says . " It 's one thing to hear it in conversation , another to see it in the paper . We used dashes . " <P> The Louisville Courier-Journal and Times went ahead and used the words , but later regretted it . " We regarded it as an official report , and it is our policy not to tinker with the text of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As complaints poured in from church groups and offended readers , Isaacs candidly apologized . " It was an error in news judgment , " he adds . " It is n't likely to happen again . " <P> Formed Image . Newsmen increasingly face the dilemma encountered by New York Times Reporter Judy Klemesrud . Interviewing the wife of Black Panther Fugitive Eldridge Cleaver , she was confronted not only by a stream of obscenity directed at white society , but also by Mrs. Cleaver 's outspoken contempt for a paper that would not print her language . Judy tried to include one of Mrs. Cleaver 's words in the story , but the word was deleted-and so was the story itself after the first edition . <P> Dashes , asterisks and euphemisms are still the way out chosen by most editors . But " if the image of the word is already formed in the mind of the reader , " says John Seigenthaler , editor of the Nashville Tennessean , " you might as well use the word . We have the responsibility of getting over to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have to say in this society and say it accurately . "
