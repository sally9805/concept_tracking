txt Vice President Humphrey indicated strongly today that he wanted Senator Edward M. Kennedy to be his running mate if he won the Democratic Presidential nomination . He said he had heard reports that Mr. Kennedy would neither seek nor accept the Vice Presidential nomination , and then added : " I have no reason to believe that . I hope it 's not true . " He praised the Massachusetts Democrat in glowing terms and said that he hoped to see him soon . He said he talked yesterday with two top Kennedy men ? Stephen Smith , Mr. Kennedy 's brother-in-law , and Theodore C. Sorensen , a Kennedy adviser . Mr. Humphrey , in an interview here , also promised a " very significant " statement on Vietnam in a few days . Denies Platform Conflict He denied any conflict with President Johnson on drafting a party platform at the Democratic convention , and he tentatively endorsed a suggestion that the two major parties make a pre-election agreement to prevent a possible electoral stalemate in the House . The Vice President also discussed his health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all Presidential candidates by a nonpartisan medical panel . Mr. Humphrey granted the one-hour interview as he resumed office work this after- : noon after a 10-day bout with ) what he called " a real rough case of the flu . " His color was ruddy , he looked fit and he spoke with his customary energy . Denounces Nixon Once , as Richard M. Nixon crossed his mind , he leaped from his chair and strode rap-1 idly around the room , his arms flailing as he denounced the candidate for the Republican Presidential nomination . He said he was fatigued , but he appeared to be well on the way to recovery . Mr. Humphrey said he had not been in touch with Mr. Kennedy since the death of the Senator 's brother , Senator Robert F. Kennedy of New York , on June 6 . He added that he expected to see Edward Kennedy in a few days . He said he had a " friendly , constructive " visit with Mr. ' Sorensen yesterday at the Waldorf-AstoriaHotel in New York . He was guarded in talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told Mr. Sorensen that he soon would make a " very significant " statement on Vietnam . Mr. Humphrey was noncommittal when asked if Mr. Sorensen had suggested a change in the Vice President 's position on the war as a condition for support by the Kennedy people . He said he did not think his differences with the Kennedys were " as wide as they have led themselves to believe . " He praised Edward Kennedy as " a fine man , able , capable . " " I have the highest regard for him , " he said . He said he had known Mr. Kennedy 10 years and considered him a personal friend . Mr. Humphrey revealed that his political operation at the Democratic convention next month would be run by another Kennedy friend , former Postmaster General Lawrence F. O'Brien . Mr. O'Brien endorsed Mr. Humphrey after the death of Robert Kennedy , for whom he had been campaigning . Mr. Humphrey declined to discuss what he would say in his forthcoming Vietnam statement , except that it would include an elaboration of his previous suggestion that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he might suggest a halt in United States bombing of North Vietnam , he said a bombing halt would be part of a cease-fire . But he said he was not thinking of a unilateral action of any kind by the United States . He said that in the coming statement , or in another early speech , he would discuss a general Asian policy for the United States . Last week he called for con-II centrating on relations with Europe and the Soviet Union . He implied then that he favored moving away from the recent preoccupation with Asia . In Asian policy generally , and Vietnam policy particularly , Mr. Humphrey has . subtly begun to point to possible differences between himself and President Johnson . But he refused today to call attention to those possible differences , except to say that he would advocate " not yesterdays , but tomorrows " in the 1968 Democratic platform . " The platform ought to be a prospectus for the future , " he said . " The Democratic party is not the party of ancient history . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my influence can be significant and honored . " Mr. Humphrey appeared to be nettled by recent suggestions by some newspaper columnists that he was pulling away from the President 's Vietnam position and that the two men would clash on the Vietnam plank of the party plat-form , " Our relations are just wonderful , if people would just leave us alone , " he said . " I am proud of being associated with Lyndon Johnson , and I am getting weary of people trying to provoke a fight between us . " ' History Will Judge ' He said , " I think history will judge the Johnson Administration very well . " He paused , then added softly , " and I gather that we will have to wait for the judgment of history . " He said he hoped the White House would " take an interest " in drafting the platform . He said he had appointed three men to present his own views to the Platform Committee . He identified them as David Ginsburg , the Washington lawyer who is co-chairman of the Citizens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United Democrats for Humphrey campaign staff , and William Welsh , his administrative assistant . Mr. Humphrey responded with a flash of anger when asked about a report by the columnists Rowland Evans and Robert Novak that President Johnson expected to write the Democratic platform . " Evans and Novak would make conflict in Heaven , " he said . Returning to the theme of criticial columnists a few minutes later , he said , " I 'm glad the columnists did n't have to prepare the Bible . They 'd have burned the Old Testament , " He was asked if any of his advisers were advocating an open break with Mr. Johnson on the war issue . " If I find one , " he said firmly , " he will be dismissed . " He said he was not interested in repudiating the Johnson record . A Vice President should be loyal , he said . " We do n't need an Aaron Burr in this Republic , " he said . Mr , Humphrey spoke with unusual harshness of his Democratic rival , Senator Eugene J. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind words for his fellow Minnesotan . Today , he ridiculed Mr. McCarthy for suggesting that he , should he given a portion of each state 's delegates based on the proportion of his strength at each state convention . He said that that notion , applied in other areas , could result in obvious problems . For example , he said , Congress in 1940 passed a draft law by a one-vote majority . Mr. Humphrey turned his palms upward and asked if the philosophy he credited to Mr. McCarthy would have required only a bare majority of the eligible men to be called to service to fight World War IL " That is sheer , unadulterated hogwash , " he said . He said he did not particularly favor the unit rule  --  un . der which all the national convention delegates of  --  a state can be bound to vote for the choice of the majority from that state  --  but he stressed that he believed firmly in " majority rule . " Majority rule is the basis for this country 's democratic system , he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fight the charges of McCarthy supporters that some Humphrey delegates have been chosen by , machine methods . He said he had lawyers investigating several McCarthy , delegates in Minnesota , Colorado and the State of Washington to determine if they met residence requirements . He said he expected some of the McCarthy delegates to be challenged before the Credentials Committee of the Democratic convention . The Past and the Future Mr. Humphrey criticized Senator McCarthy along with Mr. Nixon as he answered questions about the war issue , He asserted that the fundamental difference between himself and them was that they , used the present only to " examine , exacerbate , exaggerate and deflate the past , " while he looked toward the future . He rose , walked energetically to a bookcase , and extracted a small black notebook filled with quotations , from which he read one by Winston Churchill : " If the present tries to sit in judgment on the past , it will lose the future . " Mr. Humphrey , as Mr. Nixon did a few days ago , ruled out any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Alabama , the third-party candidate , if the Wallace candidacy should keep either major candidate from getting a majority in the Electoral College next fall . He said he was inclined to favor a recent suggestion by , Gary Orfield , a teacher of government at the University of Virginia , Mr. Orfield proposed that the two major parties agree before the election that , in case of an electoral stalemate , they would provide the necessary votes in the House to elect the candidate with the largest popular vote . In the House , each state delegation would have one vote . Mr. Humphrey said he had not studied the ramifications of the suggestion , but that he would not bargain either with a right-wing ticket or an extreme left-wing ticket , if a fourth party of that nature should develop . The Vice President said Governor Rockefeller 's entry into the Presidential race had drained away funds that some political independents might have given to his own campaign . Mr. Humphrey had a good word for Mr. Rockefeller . While condemning Mr. Nixon and Mr. McCarthy for what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Rockefeller : " I think he does have a vision of the future .
