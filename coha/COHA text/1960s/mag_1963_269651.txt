The lights in the hall fade . The slide projector goes on , and there on the screen is a picture of John and Jacqueline Kennedy with a towering , dour man about whom 40 million Frenchmen may be right . Says the lecturer 's voice of Charles de Gaulle : " What a wonderful leader for the French he has been . How he has sacrificed himself ! The women do n't make speeches in France , and Madame de Gaulle was quite surprised when I told her what the ladies do over here . " <P> What is this ? A professional travelogue ? Yes and no . An amateur 's vacation report ? No and yes . It 's the liveliest show on the Massachusetts lecture circuit . It 's Rose Kennedy , talking about the places , people and events she knows , loves and remembers best-all for the benefit of charity . Billed as " An Evening with Rose Kennedy , " she packs ' em in and sends ' em away delighted . <P> England Is Rainy . Last week , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maryborough , Mass. , benefit of the town 's Newman Catholic Women 's Club . She flipped on a slide of Windsor Castle , delivered a capsule history of Britain 's royal family , went on to urge her audience to go to Europe . " It adds meaning and enjoyment to life , especially for the younger people . . . You hear that places like Ireland and Switzerland are so cold , but it 's not true . Do n't load your suitcases down with heavy clothing . A couple of pairs of snuggies and a couple of sweaters will do . And before you go home , give them to somebody over there and fill up your valises with perfume . " <P> Onto the screen came a sadly familiar figure . " That , " said Rose , " is Mr. Chamberlain with his famous umbrella . It 's so apt to rain over there ; you should carry one of those plastic umbrellas with you when you go . Mr. Chamberlain 's position was not understood in this country . He did the best he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of England 's Queen Mother . " After dinner one evening , " recalled Rose , " the Queen and I left the men at the table and went upstairs . She asked me if I always got up to see the kids off to school . She said that she did but then went back to bed . I told her that I used to get up for the first six children , but when seven , eight and nine came , I said to myself that this could go on forever . . . " <P> A picture of Old Joe Kennedy and the kids with Pope Pius XII reminded Rose that " the Pope gaveTeddy his first Holy Communion . I thought with all those spiritual advantages Teddy might become a priest or even a bishop , but he met a beautiful blonde one evening , and that was the end of it . " <P> Tiaras Are Heavy . Amid flashing pictures of Britain 's royal family , of table settings for banquets , and of more interiors of Windsor Castle , Rose explained that " King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never King George . . . Royalty wears white so they 'll stand out . . . When dining with the Queen , the ladies always wear tiaras , but they are n't all they 're cracked up to be ; they 're quite heavy on your head .
