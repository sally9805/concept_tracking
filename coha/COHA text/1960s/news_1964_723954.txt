It had been hoped that the area on Meadow Lake would be , one of the fair 's brightest and liveliest . Instead , it is all but deserted on most nights , with only a handful of people at- , tending the major , and expen sive , shows . On Friday night Mike Todd Jr . gave up altogether . His show , " America Be Seated , " had taken in 300 at the box office in two days . The show was in the Louisiana Pavilion , on the other side of Like Meadow Bridge , the gateway to the amusement area . " There 's no use of throwing good money after bad , " Mr. Todd said yesterday . " The situation is terrible . " Concessionaires Worried Other concessionaires were also concerned . They met last week in an effort to plan something , anything , to draw people into the amusement area , in which they have invested hunAreds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said : " So many exhibits in the industrial and International areas charge for one thing or another that there ' is nothing left of the fairgoer 's dollar by the time he gets to the amusement area  --  if he gets here at all . " A spokesman for the fair said the corporation would have no comment at this time on the re1port that business in the amusement area was lagging . However , he said the area was not completed yet and added that when all the attractions opened ' ' the crowds will build up . " He also said that the fair had ' , opened " under trying eircum-1 stances " and that bad weather had affected attendance . He added that business was improving and that June , July and August would be peak months , bringing record attendance and profits to the amusement area .

Adding to the problem , the fair presents a huge fountain and fireworks show in the heart of the industrial area at 9 o'clock each night . People are drawn to this show , and after watching It leave the fair without paying a visit to the distant Lake Amusement Area . In addition , the concessionaires // find that people who park their cars in the vicinity and enter through the Meadow Lake gate are whisked into the industrial area when they board the fair 's public transportation system . The amusement area concessionaires are appealing to the fair to reschedule the bus stops to prevent this . The stakes in the battle to save the amusement area are huge . It is felt that other shows will soon be forced to close , as the Mike Todd production was , unless the tide is turned , and turned very quickly .

The show began to present paid previews on Thursday , but there have been few people to purchase tickets save for theater parties already contracted . " Shall we paper the house again tonight ? " a girl was overheard to ask yesterday of the show 's stage manager . In show business parlance " papering the house " is filling the house with people who have been given complimentary tickets . Another major investor in the amusement area ' is the American Machine and Foundry Company . Its monorail ride has been doing business that has been described as " very bad .

In general , yesterday was a disappointing day at the fair . 6 P.M. 155,406 persons had passed through the turnstiles , compared with 214,738 at the same hour a week ago .
