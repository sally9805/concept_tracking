Like James Joyce or Sigmund Freud , the late Pierre Teilhard de Chardin , Jesuit priest and paleontologist , has become an inescapable intellectual presence of the age . Until , and even after , his death in 1955 , the Vatican forbade the publication of his nonscientific works , largely because he accepted evolution as the key to human history . In the eyes of Rome , Teilhard remains a near heretic . Last month the Holy Office issued a solemn warning for religious superiors " to guard souls , especially of the young , against the dangers contained in the works of Father Teilhard de Chardin and his followers . " <P> Teilhard hoped to get his ideas published but , as a good Jesuit , obeyed when Rome said no . Nevertheless , manuscript copies of his works filtered into scholarly French circles . To the dismay of the Vatican , an international committee of intellectuals-including Biologist Sir Julian Huxley and Historian Arnold Toynbee - has posthumously sponsored publication of his major works . Teilhard , who was known in his lifetime as one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a pilgrim of the future , " and his reputation continues to grow : a museum in Paris bears his name , more than 500 monographs and 30 books have been written about him since his death , and last month 40 top European scholars gathered in Venice for a seminar to discuss his ideas . <P> Just published in the U.S. is the latest product of the Teilhard industry . Circumspectly edited by his cousin , Claude Aragonnes . Father Teilhard 's Letters from a Traveller ( Harper ; $4 ) contains a smattering of the vast correspondence he carried on with friends and relatives-often from archaeological campsites in such spots as the Gobi desert . Unlike his metaphysical masterwork The Phenomenon of Man ( TIME , Dec. 14. 1959 ) or his mystical treatise on The Divine Milieu ( TIME , Feb . ID . 1961 ) , Teilhard 's letters are largely free of neologisms , contain wise and witty comments on a world he clearly loved , and clearly saw sub specie aeternitatis . A sampling of Teilhardisms : <P> ON GOD : Today human activity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it is a problem that can be approached only in the total effort of human research and experience . It is not only that God gives lasting value to the human effort , but also that his revelation is a response to the sum total of that effort . <P> ON BUSINESS : ' How , ' you ask . ' can the success of a commercial enterprise bring with it moral progress ? ' And I answer . ' In this way . that since everything holds together in a world which is on the way to unification , the spiritual success of the universe is bound up with the correct functioning of every zone of that universe and particularly with the release of every possible energy in it . Because your undertaking is going well , a little more health is being spread in the human mass , and in consequence a little more liberty to act , to think and to love . ' <P> ON THE SOVIET UNION ( written in 1939 ) : In the end , it is Russia that is be coming public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be ... the formation of a national group , hostile , watertight , completely ignorant of what lies outside itself , and so incapable of being included in the far-reaching combination of a mankind we need .
