MORE than 30 years ago , A. Philip Randolph , then and now president of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters , proposed a Negro march on Washington to protest civil rights abuses . It was never held . But Randolph never gave up in his advocacy of the merits of the idea . His desire became a dream-and this week he would see it come true . <P> Forget the Mayonnaise . To help dramatize the Negro 's 1963 revolution , leaders of civil rights organizations seized upon Randolph 's old idea , called upon sympathizers everywhere for a " March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom . " Representatives of different , often rival , organizations got together , fired out to state and local representatives volley after volley of handbooks , bulletins , press releases , charts , schedules , visceral warnings and soul-stirring exhortations . Said one broadside : " We march to redress old grievances and to help resolve an American crisis born of the twin evils of racism and deprivation . " The march organizers listed the demands that the parade would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kennedy Administration 's civil rights legislative package- " without compromise or filibuster " ; 2 ) integration of all public schools by the end of this year ; 3 ) a federal program to " train and place all unemployed workers-Negroes or white-in meaningful and dignified jobs at decent wages " ; 4 ) a federal Fair Employment Practices Act barring all job discrimination . <P> The march itself would go only from the Washington Monument to the Lincoln Memorial . But the march organizers made impressive logistical plans . They urged marchers to bring plenty of water-but not " alcoholic refreshments . " They suggested peanut butter and jelly sandwiches , emphasized the shortcomings of mayonnaise " as it deteriorates , and may cause serious diarrhea . " They reminded everyone to wear low-heeled shoes , to bring a raincoat , to wear a hat , to remember their sunglasses . <P> Forget the Kids . They told marchers to leave their children at home , strongly suggested that each marcher buy a 250 button , displaying a black hand clasping a white hand and wear it on parade . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fountains , 22 first-aid stations manned by 40 doctors and 80 nurses to be scattered under the monument and along the route of the march . <P> To help out , the National Council of Churches volunteered to make up 80,000 box lunches ( a cheese sandwich , an apple , a slice of pound cake ) at a cut-rate 50 price for marchers . <P> District of Columbia police offered motorcycle escorts to meet incoming buses at the city 's outskirts , and 5,600 cops to patrol the parade . The Army promised to send 4,000 extra troops into the area-just in case of an emergency . The Washington Senators postponed games scheduled for Aug. 27 and Aug. 28 so that baseball would not distract anyone from serious marching . In case of arrests , judges promised to be available on a 24-hr. basis . <P> Philip Randolph could only be pleased with the thought that his dream was about to be realized . Said he : " It will be one of our greatest American experiences-creative , constructive , inspirational . "        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
