EVEN WITH AN OVERHEAD OF $114,850 A DAY , BILL HARRAH PILES UP PROFITS . THE WORLD 'S BIGGEST GAMBLER IT was on a blustery morning in January , 1955 , that William F. Harrah made the decision that was to transform him , in a few months , from a middling-successful casino operator in Reno , Nevada , into the biggest gambler in the world , the Napoleon of Chance . He was out at Lake Tahoe that morning , 50 miles from Reno , looking for a piece of property on which he could build a museum . The museum was to house the 13 freight carloads of guns , kerosene lamps , wooden Indians and similar memorabilia of the Old West that his wife , Scherry , had just purchased in southern California . Lake Tahoe is large and deep and beautiful and mountain-girt . It is pronounced " tat-hoe " and is said , on little evidence , to be an Indian word meaning big water or big whiskey or damn-all-white-men or ( according to Mark Twain ) grasshopper soup . It is deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will stand up to all but the most spectacular Alps . More important for Bill Harrah 's purposes , a state boundary bisects it , and an interstate highway runs along its south shore . The traveler going east on U.S. 50 finds himself at one swoop , with no change of altitude or climate or scenery , out of the lawbound puritanical state of California and in the wide-open state of Nevada where the bars are running 24 hours a day , and so are the crap tables and the roulette wheels . The effect is dramatic . The hordes of the humdrum  --  the businessmen from Sacramento and the shipyard workers from Vallejo , the housewives from the Peninsula and the farmers from the Valley  --  they come lurching over the invisible boundary and they all get a sparkle in their eye , an itch in their fingers ; holes burn in their pockets . The sight of a slot machine , the sound of a stickman , draws them at once into a dreamland where the rainbow ends at their elbow and the law of averages is at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Tahoe by the Californians was considered a phenomenon of the summer season , between the Fourth of July and Labor Day . The gambling places that greeted the invaders were small and dingy . There were some where , Harrah says , you needed a lock on your pockets , and even in the others there was an atmosphere of tension , a beady stare from pit bosses that would make even an experienced gambler think twice about going in . After all . the owners had barely two months to make all their expenses for the year . But the thought came to Harrah : Why did the season have to last only two months ? The lake gets cold , but human fevers stay high throughout the year , and Highway 50 is open except in the worst blizzards . It was logical to assume that a big , bright , clean , scrupulously honest place like Harrah 's Club in Reno . if it were planted smack on the state boundary , would lure customers all year round . So when , on that January day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quonset but abutting the state line , was on sale for $500,000 , he began peeling off the bills for the down payment . Harrah 's logic paid off immediately . The crowds started coming , " right from the gong , " says the owner happily , and to keep them coming Harrah went in for such new and revolutionary devices as free or cut-rate bus trips from the big cities of California . with buses that would take off on schedule even if there was only one passenger aboard . Soon the place was bursting at the seams and had to be enlarged . It was still too small . Turning people away was unthinkable , so Harrah , for three million dollars this time , acquired two small clubs across the highway . They were n't big enough either , and he drew up plans for merging them and adding to them to form the world 's biggest single structure devoted to gambling  --  bigger than anything in Las Vegas , not to speak of the poor old Monte Carlos and other outdated establishments of Europe . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Room , bigger than any then known ( 850 seats ) , with Vegas-type stars performing every night of the year . His competitors were skeptical . Why Lake Tahoe , why not the North Pole ? they asked . The late Eddie Questa , president of the First National Bank of Nevada , who had bankrolled many gamblers in his day , tried to dissuade Harrah from the project , but an hour 's conversation converted him and he pledged his bank 's credit to the maximum . When construction delays and mounting costs pushed the price up  --  Harrah was spending half a million a month , and nothing coming in  --  Questa went outside the bank to get more . Everyone was getting nervous as opening night neared . It was generally believed that if the South Shore Room was a flop the First National would be hurt badly , and with it the whole economy of Nevada . Even Eddie Questa , a fearless little lighter . was nervous , and it was only natural because a gambler can always start up again with a new wheel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harrah was n't nervous , because he had analyzed the situation and he felt sure of the outcome . He did make one mistake . He opened early in January to catch the crowds expected for the 1960 winter Olympics at Squaw Valley . The Olympics were a dud for Harrah 's purposes , because people who went to them went straight to bed at night . ( To this day Harrah has it in for skiers : They are too young to have much money and they get too tired on the slopes to stay up late gambling . ) All through February and March the bills kept piling up , and the receipts were inadequate to cover them . But Eddie Questa kept the faith , Bill Harrah never lost heart , and by April everyone was coming to agree that Harrah was right after all . From that day to this the flow has been golden . Just how golden is a business secret . Harrah will only say that it costs him $114,850 a day to stay open , and anything over that is profit . Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the size of the figure . Summer or winter , the tableau hardly changes : the clicking and clacking , the bells , the screeches of the jackpot winners , the howls of the crapshooters , the hunched expectant backs , the restless prowlers debating whether to stake their last $10 at this table or at that table . The dealers are prim and quick and confident , in their neat uniforms of white and black with green-baize aprons . Here a security man is noiselessly removing an offensive drunk . there another one is helping a fainting old lady to a cot . Overhead in the catwalks that form an attic to this room , experienced eyes are looking down through the two-way mirrors that overhang all the tables . watching for crimpers and sanders . pinchers and pressers. past posters and machine muckers . ( All these are varieties of crossroaders , or cheats . ) A line is forming for the dinner show , and the high rollers who are in for several thousand dollars are giving the pit bosses the high sign to reserve them a table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doll swathed in sequins is : belting out her own versions of familiar American ballads : Someone stole my underwear But I do n't care If I go bare Bye-bye . blackbird . And enveloping all is that air of urgency , of total emotional involvement . This is the last of the-participation sports . Those hands clutching the slot-machine levers are full of energy , every nerve at those tables is stretched tight . The talk ? " Ten the winner ! " " Coming out ! " " Jackpot , baby , I HIT THE JACKPOT ! " " Oscar dear , not that money , that was for the rotisserie you promised me ! " " Get your dirty paws off of me , you old bag , you 're bugging my dice ! " " Big eight ! " " JACKPOT ! " ? is filled with a passionate intensity found only rarely these days in the traditional places like political conventions and baseball parks . Into this swirl of color and passion comes the tall , puritanical , dark-clad form of Bill Harrah , the boss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his subordinates , but he also believes in keeping his eyes and ears open all the time . In his pocket is a little notebook in which he continually jots down ideas for the future and observations on little laxities that need remedying in the present . Underlings rush up to him and away from him with a steady flow of reports and directives : Our agents in Vegas report a sensational new act at the Sahara ; they have an overflow in the lounge . . . . So and so , the head of the such and such department , is throwing a few curves . Get his severance paycheck ready and start scraping his name off his door . . . Jimmy Durante will be arriving a day early . Make sure he has a Rolls-Royce to drive around in . . . . There 's a high roller in action at the Reno club , in for $10,000 . Send a case of anything he wants to his room . . . . That comedian in the lounge is still slipping in dirty jokes . Tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bobby Kennedy says money from the narcotics racket is finding its way into gambling . I wish that guy would make up his mind ; last week he was saying gambling money was finding its way into narcotics . . Bill Harrah is not at first sight the type you would expect to be high priest of an establishment like this . He looks more like a deacon  --  tall and thin , gray hair , a narrow face , horn-rimmed glasses , a thin smile , a keen look , a quiet voice . He is not that most common crop of the Nevada wastes , a character . He would never , like Harold Smith of Harolds Club , ride a horse into his casino or decorate his conversation with quotations from Shakespeare and Thomas a Kempis . He does not , like Lincoln Fitzgerald of the Nevada Club , go poking around his tables all day long to make sure no odd $20 bills have been mislaid . He can be animated and incisive in private , but his public manner is diffident . There are people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen Bill Harrah crack a smile , and there are some who will tell you they have never heard him utter a word . He does not drink , he does not smoke . As a matter of fact he seldom gambles . When he goes down to Vegas to look over the operations there , he 'll play a courtesy game at the 21 tables , a couple of thousand dollars or so , but so far as serious gambling goes he has neither the special knowledge nor the special temperament required . That is probably one of the reasons for his success . The average gambling man is also a gambler , moved by strange and uncontrollable hunches , ready at unpredictable moments to go across the street and try his own luck with his own profits against his neighbor 's tables . In Reno they talk with awe and admiration of the late Eddie Sahati , a suave Levantine who owned a casino at the lake which he kept staffed with what looked like bit actors from George Raft gangster films . One day he stepped up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later stepped away with $10,000 ? the worst single hour in the club 's history . It was the start of the longest consecutive run of luck ever seen in Reno . Sahati went next door to the Nevada Club and won $80,000 in two weeks . He went every day to Harolds and at one time was $500,000 ahead . He lost it all within a few months . Not long ago the manager of one of the Vegas joints opened the safe one night , took out the whole bundle of cash , and went on a gambling spree up and down the Strip . He came back in the cold dawn without a sou , and though he is still alive and still managing , he passed some nervous moments before his partners decided to give him a chance to pay it all back . A partner is one thing Harrah does not have to worry about , and that is another source of his strength . He owns his club and its subsidiary corporations , one hundred percent . This makes for efficiency all along the line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ casinos everyone who owns a few points ( one point is one percent of the business ) tries to be present every eight hours when the little boxes with money are removed from the gaming tables to the counting room . Since only the healthiest and greediest can make it three times a day , 365 days a year , the partners all hire underlings who go on the payroll at fancy salaries but whose sole function is to watch the counting . Now , who watches the watchers ? It gets very complicated , and it is not Bill Harrah 's way of running a business . That is what gambling is to him  --  a business  --  and he has no feelings of self-reproach about the harm that may come from it . Considered as a business , gambling is undoubtedly a good business . Profits are guaranteed by the laws of mathematics . You can fix the slot machines to pay any percentage you please , and the tables pay a fixed return ranging up to 5.6 percent . It is true that Professor Thorp of New Mexico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the casino at blackjack . But the number of players capable of playing the Thorp system with concentrated fidelity is pitifully small . In practice . the odds are stretched enormously in the house 's favor by certain quirks of human nature . Even when players have learned a good strategy , they rarely follow it consistently . Even you and I , the good gamblers , give way to wild hunches , run our luck , let hope override judgment , especially after live or six of the free drinks the house keeps offering us . And if we do that , think of the rabble of amateurs , the people who bet the field , split tens , drag when They 're winning and double up when they 're losing . These are the average customers . and they push their dollars into the house 's maw with a fatal regularity , like the Phoenicians pushing their sons into the jaws of Moloch . Why , then , are n't all gambling men millionaires ?  - -  - Looking at Bill Harrah 's career may show some of the obstacles . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U. C. L. A. and his father was surveying the wreckage of his world . John Harrah was a self-taught lawyer from Iowa . He settled in Venice , and while raising a family there , acquired lots and buildings . But then the depression came thundering down on John Harrah 's real estate . Staring at all his unrented buildings . he decided that he might make a little cash by turning over the ground floor of one of them to a little game then becoming popular , a primeval form of Bingo called the Circle Game . To run the game , young Bill , then 20 , left his classes . He argued his father into throwing out the junky furniture and getting in good solid stuff and tasteful decorations . He built up a staff of dependable young men ? five of them around the D.A . ' s office . Late in 1937 young Bill Harrah took off for Reno . It did n't cost much to get established back then . For $2,000 13111 opened a Bingo parlor on Center Street . That turned out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close in a couple of months . But he had cut deeply enough into the business of one of the older parlors to make the owner think of selling out . In the summer of ' 38 , Harrah was in the right location , and the ride down the boulevard of success was fairly begun . Little by little , he expanded . A few craps and 21 tables and a wheel were put in , and he began to learn the ropes of serious gambling  --  Bingo is more a social event . When the war came along , money began to roll down the streets of Reno . By the war 's end . Harrah was ready to establish a full-fledged Nevada casino , and Harrah 's Club opened its doors on Virginia Street . the main drag of Reno , in 1946 . A small club with small capital can have its difficult moments , because the law of averages does not necessarily work every day and , at first , Harrah 's profits did n't always leap from peak to peak . John Harrah , flying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to peer anxiously out of the plane window as it circled over town to see if the lights were still shining out onto the sidewalk . They never dimmed . There are a lot of things you team by experience in the gambling business : the people to trust , the checks to cash . the right way to stop fights , the ever-changing rules of the crossroaders . Above all , the people to hire . Some BIGGEST GAMBLER are still with him , and one of them , Bob Ring , is his general manager and second-in-command . Bill kept the place clean and the action going , and at the end of a year he had netted $10.000. a lot of money in those times . Happy days . But in came a serpent in the guise of the Law . The Law reflects an odd bent of the American system of values . In this country , if a man raises racehorses it may be assumed he is bucking for an ambassadorship , and the man who called you long distance to urge you to buy Transitron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our 25th reunion committee . But the man who runs a game of chance , in which the customer knows the exact mathematical odds against him , is a pariah , a low character , a criminal . The question was soon being asked in the district attorney 's office : Is Harrah 's Circle Game a game of chance or , as Harrah claims , a test of skill ? Harrah was a lawyer and he loved a fight . He lost . The game was closed . He changed the rules slightly and opened again under another name . New stirrings in the D.A . ' s office , new rolls of oratory for the defense , new verdicts , new closings , new rules . So Bridge() succeeded the Circle Game , and Tango succeeded Bridged , and the Dart Game succeeded Tango . Then it occurred to the Harrahs that there was a place where these inconveniences need not occur . The sovereign state of Nevada , desperate for any form of tourist cash , had in 1931 legalized gambling . No need there to keep the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hire an informant to snoop employees will steal you blind before you know what is going on . Others are honest but set in their ways , the old ways , and they resist the innovations that bring the customers in . Harolds Club , up the street , had started a revolution in gambling by creating a boisterously friendly atmosphere , hiring respectable young ladies as dealers . making the payoff on the slot machines extremely high , and getting rid of shills  --  anything to remove the connotations of crookedness that gambling holds for most people outside Nevada . Harrah added innovations of his own . He put tights and bells on the slot machines , so that a person hitting a jackpot was greeted with noise and jubilation . He put the big-money tables , the ones with a five-dollar minimum bet , right next to the cashier 's window so that the players could turn around and get their checks cashed with a minimum of distraction . Keep the game moving  --  that has always been his motto . The European casinos give him the willies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Why , it takes a guy twenty minutes to get to the tables ; he might have been in for a couple of hundred by that time . " He took a lot of vacations in the early days . Coming back from one of them , he noticed a new dealer , a homespun blond beauty from the Tennessee hills . Her name was originally Kandis Lucille Teague , but Earl Carroll , in whose Vanities she had appeared for a few months , had changed it to Scherry Rhyne . She never really relished the show-business kind of life and , having always had a passion for cards back in Alcoa , Tenn. , she came out to Reno to be a 21 dealer . And there one day was a tall young man leaning against the bar and staring at her . In August . 1948 , they were married . One taste they shared in a big way was booze . In those days , Bill was no more talkative than he is now , but his talk had a different tang to it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pardon me , but do you mind if I buy you a drink ? " and few were the people who minded . The glasses were lined up four deep at the bar , and anyone who went to bed before dawn was called a party pooper . " Our favorite drink was Scotch , " Scherry says . " Or bourbon , or gin , or creme de cacao , or whatever they had , " adds Bill . " Oh it was great , " he says , " just to stand around , talking and kidding and telling stories , getting to meet people . " Drinking could bring troubles too . Bill wrecked several cars . Once he broke his neck . Employees lose respect for a drunken boss , and the casino could n't help suffering from the 10 to 12 hours a day the boss was spending at the bottle . In 1952 Bill decided that he had gone through his lifetime ration . He went to his doctor , who put him in a hospital , shot him full of vitamin B , Antabuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a drop . Scherry dutifully tollowed him within a couple of weeks . Bob Ring had gone on the wagon a little earlier . In hard-drinking Reno , forming this little teetotal nucleus meant cutting off practically all social life . No more bars , no more parties , no more hooting in the dawn . The new regime meant 10 or so extra hours in the day . Bill chose to fill them by thinking . What he thought about was money . He started by calling in a firm of management consultants . His competitors , hearty gamblers of the old slapdash school , snickered , but Harrah went ahead and reorganized . The unkempt world of the casino was suddenly trimmed into a facsimile of a modern , integrated industrial plant . All the sprawling sides of the business  --  the gambling , the food and drink , entertainment , credit , real estate , financing , advertising , public relations , customer relations  --  were departmentalized . Papers went through channels . Executives held weekly meetings . The books became a model for auditors . More efficiency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The snickers ceased ; the competitors began to imitate Harrah . What he was doing was to introduce the General Motors or Sears Roebuck concept to gambling  --  streamlined organization , low unit profit , huge volume . Volume in this business means crowds , and Harrah 's gets the crowds by showering them with services and attentions . The house is always clean , the dealers trim , the decor colorful and quietly expensive . If you come from San Francisco or Sacramento , the bulk of your bus fare is refunded if you come at a quiet hour like late Sunday night . If you stay at a motel on the lake , a free taxi will drive you to and from Harrah 's . The parking lot is the size of Delaware , and you may have to wait quite a while for the attendant to get your car , but the sidewalk where you wait has hot-air vents so you wo n't catch cold . If you are a single woman and you have parked your car yourself , out by Chesapeake Bay . a security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dark . The same security man will be making a check to see that no heartless parents have left their children to freeze in their car while they are inside whooping around the tables . Children are always a problem around casinos , since they are not allowed inside by law and since the sight of wistful little creatures huddling around the doors and windows waiting for mummy to hit the jackpot offends sensitive passersby . Harrah has solved the problem by building a recreation center where his customers can park their children for a modest fee . The kids play with blocks , or see movies , or play pool , or do the Watusi . It is now the most popular rendezvous on the lake for anyone between two and 20 , and little girls anxious for dates will ask , " Daddy , is n't it a perfect weekend for you to go gambling ? " One way to keep the customers happy is to have happy-looking employees , and Harrah works that angle hard . His wage scale is high and there are fringe benefits  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , free tickets to the shows in the South Shore Room , a review committee to which discharged employees can appeal . Top executives get the free use of any type of car they fancy . In return , everyone is supervised with rare thoroughness and rated for efficiency at regular intervals . Those two-way mirrors extend even into the kitchens , so that if there is a complaint , say , about the salads , somebody can scoot back and peek at the salad makers and find out what 's wrong in a jiffy . The paternalistic hand may be a little heavy for some tastes . But in a business where the merchandise is ready cash flowing back and forth in the open . you have to be careful . And gambling has always attracted drifters and irresponsibles . Harrah is delighted that his peak period coincides with school vacation . His summer staff is full of bright , bronzed college kids and college instructors , which raises the tone of the place , at no extra cost . The thing that really brings in the customers is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becoming an impresario with the same quiet and spectacular efficiency which has served him so well in other areas . At the beginning , it was hard to get the top names , the Jack Bennys and the Red Skeltons . N'Vlio the hell is Harrah ? they asked . But the word got around . Harrah not only pays the going price , which may be up to $40,000 a week . but envelops his stars in a cocoon of hospitality such as they are unlikely to find anyplace else in the world . If they like company , he puts them up in one of the two motels he maintains as private guest lodges . If they prefer peace and privacy , they have a choice of houses by the lake , complete with servants , views , beaches , rustling pines . There are boats for scenic rides and water skiing . They can have an antique car to drive around in , with or without BIGGEST GAMBLER chauffeur . There will be flowers , candlelit dinners . And Bill Harrah on the edge of things . shyly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gosh , Mr. Harrah , " said Eddie Fisher , in for the Liberace show , " this is fabulous . All I 've been hearing in L.A. is Harrah 's , Harrah 's , but I thought a it was just talk . This is fabulous . They do n't have a stage like this on Broadway . They do n't have dressing rooms like this anywhere . And you did this all by yourself ? " " Oh no , " said Bill hastily . " I have a very good architect . " He does not believe in leaving architects idle . He recently completed a lakeside home which impresses even his Hollywood visitors . When they exclaim over the ox-sized fireplaces and the baronial dining rooms where he entertains his entertainers , he says modestly , " It is n't so hard to get something good if you are willing to spend a million dollars for it . " They say Harrah is all business . ( " People in Reno will tell you that any time of the day 1 know just how much we took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true . ' ' ) But there is a leisure side to his life too . He likes leisure  --  as long as it is connected somehow to the internal-combustion engine . He loves automobiles . The first car he drove was his father 's Hudson . He was eight years old , too small to turn the crank , but if his father left the car parked on an incline when he went off to work in the city , little Bill could get it going and keep driving all day , provided he did n't let the engine die . Soon he was pestering his father for a motorcycle . You can have one , said John , if you find one at the right price . He ran around and found one , at $50 . Too expensive , said the old man . He ran around some more and found another one : $25 . Anything that cheap . said the old man , ca n't be any good . By the time he figured out the deep game his father was playing , he was old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he began roaring around the suburbs of Los Angeles in Model T 's and Model A 's , hopped up with overhead valves , impressing the girls and picking up traffic citations wholesale . The juvenile hellion-on-wheels still peeps out of Bill Harrah 's sober eyes . In his drinking days he once did what he says many a true driver has always longed to do . Hung up for eternity behind a lady driver straddling the middle of a two-lane street , he gently closed in on her . in low gear and then pushed her firmly through Reno . " For Crissakes . Bill . you ought n't to have done that , " said the cop , but without great emotion . To this day , he enjoys playing tricks on overconfident drivers . Say he is cruising along in his Pontiac station wagon at 90 or 95 . ( There is no speed limit on Nevada highways . ) Along comes a Jaguar convertible which a young man is showing off to his girl , and with an insolent toot the Jag goes by . What the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealing with any old Pontiac but one that has been specially fitted with a 421-cubic-inch engine , a favorite with hot rodders , Suddenly he hears a swish , and there is the Pontiac in front of his Jag . He grimaces at the girl , and steps on the gas . He steps some more , the dust flies , the landscape reels ; but the same old squat Pontiac is still there , a mile or so ahead of him . The Pontiac is only one of Harrah 's five personal cars . He also has a Chevy II outfitted with a fuel-injected Corvette engine and racing brakes ; a Lincoln Continental with a Chrysler 300 D engine and Hydra-Matic shift ; and two stock Ferraris . But Harrah is basically an old-car nut . As soon as he began making big money , he began looking for an antique . That was in 1948 and he picked up a Maxwell AB Runabout , a two-cylinder 1911 job . People with one antique car generally get another , if they can afford it , and Harrah soon had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world , and there is little doubt that that is what he has today . There are over 900 cars in it now  --  he expects to go over 1,000 ? every one being rare , or the first of its kind , or especially handsome . Harrah also has sixamotorboats and a steamboat  --  the same shape and dimensions as the African Queen in the movie , except that it needs three men to run it instead of the one Humphrey Bogart . He also has an airplane , a new Beechcraft . Sometimes he and Scherry fly off to their retreat in Stanley , Idaho , a luxurious log cabin in the shade of the Sawtooth Mountains , and there they lie around and fish and snooze , far from daily papers and telephones . Well , there is a telephone a few hundred yards away , and Bill visits it periodically to check on the day 's receipts back in Nevada . Harrah 's thoughts are never very far from business , from his plans for bigger and better . He has started putting up a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a figure not chosen at random ; the First National Bank built the town 's first skyscraper , and it is 17 stories high . The world might as well be reminded that Bill Harrah , with his seven vice presidents and 2,500 employees ( 3,000 in the summer season ) is the biggest employer of labor in the state of Nevada ( except for the Atomic Energy Corn-mission when it tests bombs ) . Where are all the customers going to come from to fill the new gambling spaces Harrah is planning for ? As far as Harrah is concerned , they have only started coming . Northern California is growing all the time and , despite all the advertising and all the word of mouth , there are still plenty of people who have not yet made their first visit to Tahoe and the South Shore Room . Little by little they 'll find their way . The operators down in Las Vegas once affected to belittle the Harrah operation because of its mass appeal . You ca n't get rich on slobs , they said . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  TV producers , Texas oil men , Hollywood psychiatrists , people in that bracket . The trouble with a high-class crowd is that , comes a misfortune like a stock-market decline , they stop gambling ; but Harrah 's income keeps rising with the Gross National Product . Impelled by Harrah 's success , Las Vegas interests are now erecting or planning structures of their own in the pasture and pineland up the way . They will be paying a lot more for their land than Harrah ever did , and he is not worried about their competition . With his strategic position athwart the state line , Bill Harrah will always get first crack at the customers . ?
