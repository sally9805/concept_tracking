txt Washington President Kennedy is giying the example these days , of a man who bravely keeps a stiff upper lip . No , he says , this is not " the winter of our discontent " even though virtually everything seems to be going wrong that could go wrong : abroad a recalcitrant de Gaulle , at home a sluggish economy , and in between ' Republicans attacking.him on Cuba , on " managed " news , on defense - contract awards , or . " fiscal irresponsibility , " and his failure to end unemployment . The situation has raised hopes among Republicans for a triumphant return in 1964 , and for all Mr. Kennedy 's easy self-assurance nobody really knows what is going on in his own thoughts . Pressure Kept Up Washington is making a new appraisal of the administration : Is it really wavering , or is it merely passing through a bad period in the customary rhythm of an activist administration ? On the domestic front Mr. Kennedy is pushing two programs which will probably influence everything else . If he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irrelevant . The first is strictly economic : He has not succeeded in getting " the country moving again , " so he has brought forth his tax-cut program . The political cost to Mr. Kennedy of entering 1964 with a recession would be enormous . Mr. Kennedy is keeping up constant pressure ; hardly a day passes when either he , or some Treasury official from Secretary C. Douglas Dillon down , does n't make a speech . He is getting results . Defense Budget Again , just this week Democrats and Republicans of the congressional Joint Economic Committee , came out in separate reports , each urging an even bigger first-year tax cut than Mr. Kennedy 's $3,000 , - 000,000 . Gov . Nelson A. Rockefeller wants a bigger first-year cut , too . Mr. Kennedy also has so arranged matters that if business sluggishness continues or a recession appears it will stimulate his radical countercyclical economic program . The second really big domestic issue Mr. Kennedy has on his hands is only just appearing : It is a tremendous shake-up of the defense budget . It already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nassau ( with reverberations in Britain and France ) : the decision to make TFX ( a supersonic tactical aircraft ) for use , not by one service , but by both the Air Force and Navy : and the likely cancellation of another gigantic project , Dyne-Soar , on which hundreds of millions already have been spent . And Now Skybolt ? The paradoxical clement connecting all these is that tough , autocratic Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara , erstwhile of Ford , is trying to save billions just at a time when Congress is proclaiming that it wants to save billions , too . But the McNamara weapons-juggling affects thousands of jobs and the biggest established interest in the country , the military-corporate " nexus " against which President Eisenhower warned . The British wanted Skyl:ilt ; " too expensive " and not needed , said Mr. McNamara . The Air Force wanted a separate supersonic aircraft ; " too expensive " and not the most practical way , said McNamara . As for Dyna-Soar ? Mr. McNamara may speak any minute . Defense takes over half Mr. Kennedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interchangeable TFX is $5,500,000,000 . In the long run the Kennedy domestic " score " will probably be marked on the two foregoing issues .
