RESEARCH &; DISCOVERY <P> The newest wonder of the electronic age is a machine that can read and digest and retain what it reads-even if it takes no special pleasure in curling up with a good book . Known in industry as the optical scanner , it operates roughly on the principle of the human eye , has already earned the obvious Orwellian nickname : <P> " The Eye . " With the help of light beams , video and mirrors , the optical scanner moves rapidly across letters , numbers and handwriting , breaks them down into " machine language , " or electrical impulses , and passes them along for an analysis to an electronic computer ( see diagram ) . The scanner can do the work of from 25 to 100 people better and faster than they could , rarely makes errors , and does not need time out for coffee breaks . <P> In the burgeoning field of data processing , involving everything from billing customers to registering book club memberships , the optical scanner is a major , long-awaited breakthrough . The chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told-is that they can record and process information only as fast as they are fed it , usually by bored and fallible humans who read the information , then punch it onto cards or tape for the computer . With the optical scanner , which can read up to 96,000 cards per day , the computer-and every paper-laden company-has found a powerful ally . Scanners already read and process insurance premium notices , gas station bills , travelers checks , dividend checks . The National Biscuit Co. has cut the time for tallying inventory from a month to three days with a scanner , and a scanner-sorter being tested for the Post Office Department can process letters five times faster than by hand . <P> Kindergarten &; Bookworms . All these machines are the products of a little-known firm called Farrington Manufacturing Co. of Needham Heights , Mass. , an old-line display-box and credit-card maker that has taken a giant step into electronics . Tiny Farrington ( 1959 gross revenues : $10.9 million ) has stolen a march on the nation 's giant business machine makers . It is the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 31 reading voraciously for U.S. industry . This week Farrington announced that five insurance companies have ordered optical scanners to solve their premium-billing paperwork problems . Farrington 's scanners range from a simple , kindergarten type , which reads only numbers , to a sophisticated bookworm that can read whole pages at a time . They rent out on a three-year lease at $1,650 to $6,100 per month . <P> So vast and alluring is the potential of the optical scanner that Farrington 's competitors are doubling their efforts to bring out their own scanners . IBM is testing several models , and RCA will soon field-test a pilot model to handle subscriptions at a major publishing house . Addressograph-Multigraph Corp . has its first orders for optical readers from major oil Companies . National Data Processing <P> Corp . ( 51% owned by Chance Vought Aircraft ) is developing a scanner : so is Cambridge 's Baird-Atomic , Inc. , which is working on a scanner for the Air Force that is able to read Russian , then feed it to a computer that translates the words into English . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in detail , and the makers guard their secrets carefully .
