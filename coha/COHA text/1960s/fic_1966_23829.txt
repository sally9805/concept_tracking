The Blessing A story by Graham Greene The archbishop was a quarter of an hour late , and Weld , who was uncomfortably pressed into the crowd on the dock , below a heavy glaring sky , resented the delay . It seemed to him absurd that he was there at all . The ceremony could not possibly rate more than a couple of sticks in tomorrow 's paper , insufficient to justify even his train fare from the capital . He suspected that for some obscure reason Smiley , his chief , had wanted him out of the office for the day . Perhaps someone of importance was arriving from England Smiley had not been too pleased when Weld 's story of a small pacifist demonstration had been raised to the head of a column on the principal news page . He had made a slighting reference to the chief subeditor of the foreign room ? " He never had a sense of values . " - You never know , " Smiley had said to him that morning with the sour expression which belied his name ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " It 's very improbable . Even if they do ... " " Try to make a story out of the ceremony itself . You have a pretty sense of irony . Or so Crowe thinks " ( Crowe was the chief subeditor ) . " There are no Catholics on the board  --  as far as I know . " But were there ? Perhaps that was the point of sending him south . Perhaps Smiley was trying to blacken his reputation in London by encouraging him to take a false step . When he arrived at the port Weld went straight to the taverna in the upper town where he could expect to find his colleagues , if anyone beside himself had troubled to come so far for so little . But 92 THE BLESSING he had been overpessimistic . At least the agencies were represented by their junior men  --  Hughes of the AP , Collins of the United Press , Tumbril of Reuters , and of course all the natives . He saw no sign of the Telegraph , the Express , or the Mail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made out of artichokes and he was in the course of being interrogated by Tumbril when Weld arrived . Tumbril was a very serious young man , but under these circumstances he had the support of Hughes , who was obviously just as unhappy at being there as Weld . " You have n't answered Tumbril 's question , " Hughes said . " Oh , heretics like you can not be expected to understand . " He uttered the word " heretics " with a smile as an Englishman might have said " bastards . " " You told me yourself , " Tumbril persisted , " that you thought this was an unjust war . " They spoke in English in a hazy hope that the barman might not understand . " Well ... perhaps .. " " How can you bless the weapons which are to be used in an unjust war ? " " I do not suppose it will make them more efficacious , if that is what you fear . " " Are you going to bless the canisters of poison gas ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  not human beings . " " What earthly good ... ? " " No earthly good . I assure you , no earthly good . " " You are escaping with a quibble , " Hughes said . " What is a quibble ? " Collins said to Weld , " What 's yours ? " " A Negroni . " " What are you here for ? " " What are you here for ? " " Caper thought there might possibly be a dem-onstration . " " Against an archbishop ? Here ? Not a chance . " " That 's what I said . I was going down to the sea with Martha . You know Martha ? " " Oh , yes . Yes . " Martha was the plump and prehensile wife of a German correspondent who was Graham Greene 's dozen or more novels often reflect his wide foreign travels  --  for example , a leper colony in Africa in " The Burnt-Out Case , " Mexico in " The Power and the Glory , " Southeast Asia in " The Quiet American , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Comedians . " He has also been a playwright , journalist , and a wartime officer of the British Ministry of Information . suspected of strong Nazi sympathies . She was said to look after men 's needs with a simple and indiscriminate fervor , and most men felt a strong moral duty to betray her husband . " Why did n't you bring her with you ? " " I did . She 's waiting for me at ? " and he named a resort popular with pederasts , lesbians , and English tourists . " You wo n't have much time . These ceremonies are always late  --  and prayers drag on so . " " I was hoping , old man , that you 'd do me a favor . Tumbril wo n't and Hughes  --  for reasons of his own which I can only surmise  --  ca n't . I thought perhaps you 'd telephone to me when it 's all over at the Grand Hotel  --  I mean only if something unexpected occurs . I 've seen so many of these affairs . I 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insurance , that 's all . " " Very well . I 'll ring you between five and six . It 's going to be bloody hot . " " They 'll have rigged up something over the tribune . " " I 'm not going on any tribune . The only chance of a story will be in the crowd . " " What an optimist you are , Weld . " " I said the only chance . What 's yours ? " " Campari soda . Cigarette ? " " Thanks . " Weld took the cigarette , the tenth of the day , handling it like an enemy . He knew that later in the afternoon his smoker 's cough would inevitably begin , rasping the dry throat , keeping him awake all the short night before the sun struck through the shutters at five . He had promised himself not to smoke till the ceremony was over , but the Negroni had weakened his resistance . " What about the men they are going to kill ? Will the blessing help them ? " Hughes returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are always writing about ? " " Not me , old man . If you work for an agency you ca n't afford fancy words . What 's good for the Express is poison for the Mail . We give them the so-called facts and leave the irony and indignation to men like Weld here . " Two hours later Weld stood on the dock in a crowd that smelt of garlic and sweat-soaked cloth . He was a tall man and he could see easily , in spite of the police who were ranked shoulder to shoulder in front of them . There was no tribune , and when the moment came very little ceremony . In the space between the troopship and the crowd , tanks were lined up . Sullied with camouflage they looked secondhand , like old cars on a city park rig lot waiting for a buyer or the scrap heap . The crews lounged a little apart as though disowning them . A child screamed persistently close to Weld and was finally given the breast . Only the flags on the troopship , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least someone had an enthusiasm for the war blundering on beyond the sun-polished horizon . The crowd had none . It seemed to Weld they had come here like himself in case something happened . There was a general tone of black because of the number of women , so that he had the sense of forming part of a nation in mourning rather than of a nation under arms . He was looking the other way at the houses beyond the railway , where the bright bedcovers hung from the windows in place of flags , when someone gave an order , and as he turned the crews had snapped to attention beside their machines , and a little old man in a black cassock with a crimson silk edging was shuffling slowly down their ranks . He wore a stole over his shoulders and violet stockings and picked his way in silver-buckled shoes . The lace on his cotta looked old like himself . A young priest towered over him from behind carrying a purple biretta . There was a small flurry of priests , and in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the impression of a pigeon being plucked , a small plump pigeon . The crowd was cheering now  --  so it was n't , after all , a funeral . As the archbishop came to each tank he paused , and a priest thrust a great prayer book in front of him from which he read , bending very close to the page as though his oId eyes could see no more than an inch or two ahead . Then another priest put a censor into his hand and he swung it to and fro , and whatever breeze there was from the sea sent the blue smoke back toward the crowd , so that for a moment the sweet smell dispersed the sweat and the garlic . " Ah mother of God , sweet mother of God , " said the man who stood by Weld , and Weld saw that he was weeping . It shocked him . He had never been quite so close before to superstition . The man 's face was wrinkled like a windfall apple which has lain too long upon the ground . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he kept on repeating . " Ah , the saint of God . " He spoke in the accent of the country , not of the port . Weld was irritated by the man 's piety , by his simplicity , or perhaps by the great heat of the day . " So this is a holy war , " he said scornfully . The old man looked at him with surprise . " It is a cursed war , " he said . " Two men in my village will never come home . Why should we fight over there ? The devil makes wars , not God . " " Then why not let the devil bless the tanks ? " The Dreamer by William Childress He spent his childhood hours in a den of rushes , watching the gray rain braille the surface of the river . Concealed from the outside world , nestled within , he was safe from parents , God , and eyes that looked upon him accusingly , as though to say : Even at your age , you could do better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and at evening , when fireflies burned holes into heaven , he took the path homeward in the dark , a small Noah , leaving his safe ark . The devil does not bless . He does not know how to bless . " " You are against the war , " Weld said , " and yet you see nothing wrong in an archbishop blessing tanks ? " " Why should he not bless the tanks ? " the old man asked . The archbishop passed on , and the old man clapped and yelled , " A saint . A saint , " gleefully now as though he and the archbishop were sharing a joke together . Some children were flinging crackers over the heads of the police , the ceremony was nearly over , and there had been no demonstration . The holy mutter passed out of hearing , while the smell of incense faded . Weld said to the old man , speaking very simply because his command of the language was weak , " I do not understand . You say this is a cursed war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and old rifles who are defending their country . How can your holy archbishop bless these instruments of evil ? " " I do n't like them myself , " the old man said , " ugly dangerous things  --  but then , if you have the desire to bless , you bless . " " I do not understand . " " I do a lot of blessing myself , " the old man said . " It 's when you want to love and you ca n't manage it . You stretch out your hands and you say God forgive me that I ca n't love but bless this thing anyway . I had a spade , the handle was always coming loose , and I cut my foot with it , so I blessed it  --  I had to bless it or break it  --  and I could n't afford to break it . A woman comes to me every week complaining of my dog . She wants it gelded , poor woman . I ca n't do that , it 's against nature , she calls me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? the next thing you know I 'm blessing her , poor thing , because I ca n't love her . " Weld could not follow . It was as though he had found himself in a very simple landscape , yet one where every path led into a maze from which there was no visible exit . " But the archbishop , " he said , " dressed up like that , the incense , the prayers . . . " He said , " All the world knows you have been using mustard gas ... " He broke off ; it was an absurd accusation to bring against one peasant . " And these tanks ... " " Ugly dangerous things , " the old man repeated . They do n't even shine like a new plow does . They look as though they had spotted fever . Perhaps the archbishop hates them  --  I would n't be surprised . We have to bless what we hate . I remember hating once  --  it was a great gray rat and it killed my pullets . I had it cornered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I blessed it . It died after that , run over by the priest 's car . May be these tanks will die too and the poor souls in them . I 've never known a blessing save a life . But then , if you want to bless , you bless . It would be better to love , but that 's not always possible . " It was after five before Weld got back to the taveries in the upper town . He telephoned to Collins at the Grand Hotel . Collins replied petulantly  --  perhaps the afternoon had not gone as well as he had hoped , perhaps Weld had interrupted something , he thought he heard a woman 's laugh . Collins said , " I only asked you to telephone if something interesting happened . " " Nothing happened . " " Well , all right , goodbye then , " and he rang off without a word of thanks . Hughes and Tumbril came into the bar while Weld was telephoning , and so the ritual of paying for rounds of whiskey began . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It had probably been stolen from him in the crowd . " A packet of Players , " he said to the barman . The grime of the long hot afternoon had dried his throat . A cigarette would not help , it would only start his cough again , and he hesitated a moment with his hand raised before he took the packet ; perhaps he could wait a little longer  --  say , until the third round . " Look at Weld , " Hughes said to Tumbril , " he 's blessing the cigarettes . " " I bless the whiskey , " Tumbril said , passing his hand over the glass . " Sweet product of the fields . Sweet golden grain . I love you as dearly as the archbishop loves his dear old tanks . " " You do n't bless what you love , " Weld said . " What about your cigarettes then ? " " They are my enemy . They 'll kill me in the end . " He could n't wait any longer . He lit one and almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known a blessing save a life , " he said . The sentence sounded like a familiar quotation .
