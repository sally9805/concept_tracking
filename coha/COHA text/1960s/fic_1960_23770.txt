The Reluctant Giver A Story by GERTRUDE FRIEDBERG W HEN Mr. Gamp asked stealthily at breakfast , " What are you bringing Ed for his fiftieth birthday ? " Mrs. Gamp tried to look as if she had not been waiting for this question with a heavy heart since the moment she had awakened . Gift-giving , as pervasive a rite as hand-shaking , held the Camps in compulsive fealty . Almost every clay they would find themselves obliged to acknowledge a dinner , applaud an engagement , flatter a weekend , regret a farewell , deplore an appendectomy , envy a voyage , hail an opening , or merely note the passage of years with a gift . Each gift , demanding as it did a sortie downtown , an anguished search , a feverish assessment of personality , and , finally , decision , put to intolerable strain Mrs. Gamp 's earnest imagination . Whenever a friend got married , Mrs. Gamp knew very well what she was in for . " Inconsiderate , " she would murmur bitterly , flinging the announcement aside . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mrs. Camp 's temperament , followed rapidly by a parade of vital statistics which she would be forced to salute at significant intervals . An apartment would be taken , requiring suitable blessing . Thereafter , the young couple would sit watching the clock , greeting every tick as some mathematically computed anniversary which they were ready to share with friends . Children Drawings by Bernard Krigstein would insist on being born , would age whenever possible , would embark upon and forsake with honor all manner of commemorable activities , and in no time at all would be graduating from some obscure institution , " great wild things with esoteric tastes , " she would say , looking desperately at Mr. Gamp , " and I just do n't know what you buy a pair of eighteen-year-old twins , male and female , if they 've already read David Copperfield . " " It 's better to give than to receive , " said Mr. Camp firmly . Mrs. Gamp did n't know which was worse . The very sight of an object emerging from its tissue paper made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed gave her the notion that she jangled . Frequently she would stop and ask Mr. Camp anxiously , " Do I jangle ? " " I do n't hear anything , " Mr. Camp would say . At a time when she still possessed a perfectly good wrist watch that Mr. Gamp had given her , she received another from a fond uncle . Feeling that her uncle was defrauded if his gift was not conspicuously consumed , she took to carrying the new watch in her purse and whenever she consulted the watch on her wrist she would take out the watch from her pocketbook and consult that also . The two watches did not seem to give her any more time than she had had before , and finally Mr. Camp told her not to look at the 39 second watch . " It 's ostentatious , " he said . Perhaps it was this very unwillingness to receive that made Mrs. Gamp so reluctant a giver . While an importunate giver may erode innocence , a reluctant giver bites himself in two , makes a nuisance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation 's economy . Mrs. Gamp always went downtown for a gift with a heavy heart . She would walk around the stores looking at everything , unable to gird herself to purchase . Shoppers drew away as she muttered angry words of exhortation to herself , and saleswomen fell silent at the approach of her heavy , hopeless tread . Things looked so much better off where they were than bought . She was at her worst in a gift corner . The glittering objects pleaded with her for commitment . She waited for the perfect gift to call her by name , to fly out and perch on her shoulder . Nothing called . Nothing perched . She would just stand there , studying the displays . At closing time the management had no choice but to have her swept out along with the discarded handbills . F V E N when Mrs. Gamp was so fortunate as -4 to choose at last , after many agonized expeditions , a gift which seemed almost satisfactory , there remained the card to write . " Just a moment , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clash off a card . " Mrs. Gamp schooled herself not to be too fastidious about a card . Usually she felt that she would be content with a few words vaguely relevant to the occasion , complimentary without being effusive , and touched with wit which would not sound labored . Unfortunately , the few words , for which she would gladly have paid at a dollar a word , were never forthcoming . On one occasion it took her two weeks to write a card . Every once in a white Altman 's would telephone and ask how things were coming along . " Just relax , " they told her . " Do n't worry about us . Get plenty of sleep and do n't push yourself . Let it come to you . " Inevitably she wrote , " Congratulations , " and let the gift go out . After two weeks the word seemed to have all those virtues of modest pliment , even of whimsy , for which she had searching . Mrs. Gamp was at her very best when told precisely what a person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had bought for her young nephew , a purchase which she eventually scored as a conspicuous success . She had neglected to buy him a gift when he was born because all the inlant clothes lookedas if they would be outgrown too quickly . As it turned out , she was right , because in no time at all the boy was graduating from the military academy and a carriage blanket with a tassel-tied hood was just about the last thing he 'd ask for . Mrs. Gamp went downtown with a firm resolve to get him something anti looked at hundreds of items , but at last it seemed only prudent to wait for his college graduation and get him something really worth while . One clay Mr. Gamp told her that her nephew was opening a new office and Mrs. Gamp went promptly to the telephone to ask him what he would really like . He sounded a little sharp with her , perhaps because it was not the first time she had asked him what he really wanted . " I 'd like to get you something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and I thought you might have a suggestion . " " Get me a pair of black socks , size 12 , " he said briskly . For your office ? " " I keep a pair of feet under the desk , " he said and hung up . Mrs. Gamp felt at once that this was one gift she would surely buy . She went downtown in high spirits , saying to herself , " Black socks , size 12 . " She walked into the store like a person who knew what she wanted . Sweeping out of the way two other customers who were just wasting everybody 's time clillyclallying over vague color preferences , she barked out , " Black socks , size 12 . " Mrs. Gamp tapped her foot as if , once this purchase were made , she would dash off to several hundred others . " Cotton or nylon ? " snapped the salesgirl . Mrs. Gamp reeled back . " Cotton , " she faltered , " or maybe nylon . " " Knee or ankle ? Stretch or stable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or vulnerable ? With or without clocks ? Washable or throwaway ? " Mrs. Gamp clutched the counter tightly . " No clocks , " she muttered and turned away . After a few months her strength returned and she went back to the store to have another go at it . The salesgirl started rattling off her inquisition in a cynical tone which made it very clear that she never expected Mrs. Camp to know any answers . When she got to , " Ankle or knee ? " in her insolent way , Mrs. Gamp snapped Gertrude Friedberg , wife of a doctor and mother of two children , has a group of stories and sketches in the Scribner anthology , " Short Story Two . " This is her first in " Harper's. " 40 THE RELUCTANT GIVER back , " Waist . " And when she came to , " Plain or ribbed ? " Mrs. Gamp managed to put in , " Plucked . " From there on it was touch and go , but Mrs. Gamp held her own . At least she felt that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her nephew on his fifth wedding anniversary the bottom part of a pair of black , knit , sheared-nylon tights with feet . His thank-you note was reassuring . He wrote , " I have just the place for them under my desk . " B U T few gift assignments were as productive as this , and after an afternoon of fruitless shopping Mrs. Gamp would come home and lie down on the floor with a book on her face . So if Mr. Gamp asked now , " What are you bringing Ed for his fiftieth birthday party ? " it was because only the day before he had found Mrs. Gamp lying on the floor with a book on her face and suspected the worst . " I could n't find anything for him , " said Mrs. Gamp sulkily . " Where did you look ? " " Saks , Abercrombie and Fitch , Macy 's , Mark And there just those stores . Why in Macy 's alone . .. " His eyes glazed a little . " I could n't see what anybody would want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and some , like the magnetic compass I saw at Whelan 's , cost too little . " " You could n't give Ed a compass on his fiftieth birthday . " " That 's what I thought , " said Mrs. Gamp sensibly . Yet she had often wondered at the downright blatancy with which others gave gifts . Once she had accompanied Ed 's wife , Mary , to buy a gift for an aged logician off to Europe for an honorary degree . The delicacy of this assignment would have shocked Mrs. Gamp into inertia for months . Mary brought the scientist a striped tie . It was the first tie he had ever been given and he wore it constantly thereafter . " Tell you one thing , " said Mr. Gamp bitterly . " You would n't catch the Queen of England coming to Ed 's party without a gift . Look what she gave Eisenhower when she visited him . " " What ? " asked Mrs. Gamp uneasily . " She brought him an English walnut and black calfskin table with a copy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why do n't you ever think up a gift like that ? " " President Eisenhower must have told her what he wanted , " Mrs. Gamp muttered jealously . Early in life she had resigned herself to the knowledge that she would never he a queen , but this new royal coup pierced her with dejection . That evening when Mr. Gamp came home , she was still giftless , but dressed for the party . " It 's time we took a stand on it , " she said to Mr. Gamp . " I 'm going to tell them outright that we 're not giving any gift . " Mr. Gamp knew it was useless to argue . " You 'll never get away with it , " he said , looking at her apprehensively . " This is going to take great courage , " said Mrs. Gamp , squaring her shoulders . " I feel like a Pioneer . " " You do n't have to look like one , " said Mr. Gamp . He fixed the zipper at the back of her dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When they arrived at Ed 's place , Mrs. Gamp put a firm finger on the bell . " We 'll offer him our good wishes , " she said , with a brave show of correctness . " After all , ' the only gift is a portion of yourselr . " " Not for Ed it is n't , " said Mr. Gamp gloomily . " A man like Ed is used to the best . " Inside , Mr. Gamp squeezed ahead of his wife and set himself in the midst of a preceding group of guests , all of whom were laughing joyously while they unloaded large , festively wrapped packages into Ed 's arms . In this confusion Mr. Camp found that by thrusting out an arm just as a package was changing hands and smiling modestly every time Ed shouted , " Thank you , " his lack of a gift went unnoticed . Then he lost himself in the crowd about the bar . Ed looked at Mrs. Gamp , still at the door , and whispered something to Mary , his wife . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Happy birthday , Ed , " said Mrs. Gamp . " 1 have n't any gift . " " That 's all right , " said Mary . " Do n't give it a thought , " said Ed . His hand on her back was unnecessarily firm as he propelled her into the living-room . " What will you have to drink ? " List a little of the decarbonated residue in that empty bottle of ginger ale , " said Mrs. Camp unhappily . " Coming up , " said Ed . " And I 'll just have this burnt cheese canape that the cheese fell out of , " she said . Ed left her and she moved about , looking for broken chairs to sit on and unpopular guests to talk to . Mr. Gamp headed the other way every time he caught sight of her . A woman she did n't know leaned toward her confidentially . " I got him a leather desk set , " she said . " It 's a perfect gift for a man . I give it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while . " I did n't get him anything , " she said . " Oh ? " said the woman sharply . She looked at Mrs. Camp w h her eyes full of leather desk sets , then plunged into conversation with the woman on her other side . After a while Mrs. Gamp pushed her way through the guests and came up behind her host . " Ed , " she said solemnly , " I want you to know that you have my very best wishes . " " Ah-ah-ah , " said Ed . " Let me Freshen that drink of yours . What was yours again ? " " Residue , " she said . " Decarbonated residue . " " Oh , yes , " he said and dashed off . When the cake was cut and the guests had sung " Happy Birthday to You , " Ed started opening his gifts . He unwrapped a wallet , the letters , E. J. R. , monogrammed neatly in gold on the lower right corner . " Monogrammed ! " said Ed , reverently. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close to Mrs. Camp , hey nostrils flaring authoritatively . " However did you choose ? " asked Mrs. Gamp . " They show you such a great variety in that book of monograms . " " I saw in an instant that this was unquestionably the best , " said the guest . And Ed nodded . With a napkin Mrs. Gamp wiped away a bit of deviled egg that she had spilled on her dress . She looked around for Mr. Cramp . He was sitting on the window seat , half-hidden by the drapes . A ETER a while the table was covered with a litter of boxes and mounds of tissue paper . Besides the desk set and the wallet there were a traveling tie-holder to give a man something to work on while his wife packed his valise , a pair of fur-lined gloves , a mammoth silver shoehorn or spooning yourself into your shoes without ever having to face them , a cigarette box that popped cigarettes up as the cover lifted , and a leather road-map holder with an attached pad and pencil to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembered having seen most of them in the stores . They looked like excellent gifts now . " Say ! " shouted one of the guests . " Where 's the Camps ' gift ? " There was a solemn hush as all eyes fell on Mrs. Gamp . Mrs. Camp recognized that this was the moment to which all her life had been leading . It was a moment she had often imagined : her brave , defiant gesture ; the white-robed allegorical creature , perhaps called " History , " smiling significantly and turning a leaf in a huge book . Just then the zipper at the back of her neck gave a little . Mrs. Gamp hung her head . " I would have gone out for one this morning , " she said , " but the clock stopped and I did n't know how late it was and the man was coming to fix the refrigerator . " Somebody patted her shoulder compassionately . The guests had begun talking to each other again . " Tell you what , Ed , " said Mrs. Gamp , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you look around downtown and if you see anything you like between three and seven dollars you could just charge it to my address , or maybe you better pay for it and I 'll gladly send you the money . Then if you wanted to send the gift back to the store you could just send the refund to me instead of the store sending it to you . " " Well , that 's all right , " said Ed . " You do n't have to . . . " " Just be sure you ask them to gift-wrap it . " Mrs. Gamp went to join Mr. Gamp . " Take me home , " she said . " People are talking about me behind my back . " " What are they saying ? " he asked curiously . " They 're saying that I 've gained weight and have no firm opinions , " said Mrs. Gamp , biting her nails , Mr. Gamp looked regretfully at the birthday cake . " We could give him the same gift we gave him last time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the stuff he got last time , still half-wrapped . " " What 's the use ? " asked Mrs. Gamp . " It was bad enough the first time we gave it to him . " Q U I E T L Y they took their things from the coat closet and were just opening the front door when Mary spied them . " Where do you think you 're going ? " asked Mary sharply . " We have gifts for everybody . " " We do n't get any , " said Mrs. Gamp sullenly , " because we did n't bring Ed anything . " " That makes no difference , " said Mary with tight lips . " Nobody 's getting out of here without a gift " " Please , " said Mrs. Camp . " Let us go as we came , empty-handed but with full hearts . " " What were they trying to do ? " asked Ed , coming over with a threatening scowl . " Trying to sneak out without their gifts . " " Anybody tries to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Ed . " Here you are . Blue-ribboned package for the men , pink for the ladies . " " I wish you would n't , " said Mr. Camp mildly , but be accepted the brightly decorated package . It was something Mrs. Camp could never understand about Mr. Camp . He did n't really mind getting a gift . She would often ask him , " Just what do you like about it ? " and he would say , " Well , you open it up and there you 've got something inside that 's for you that you did n't have before , " and Mrs. Gamp would answer , " That 's just it . Then you 've got it . " Ignoring Mrs. Gamp 's cries of demurral , Mary was thrusting things into her arms : not only the pink-ribboned gift , but a gold and green paper hat , a hand-decorated copy of the words to " Happy Birthday to You , " and a pen with " Ed and Mary " printed on it . " And you just must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snatching a wet sheaf of them from a nearby vase . " No , please , " begged Mrs. Gamp faintly . " I never use flowers . " It was useless to protest . The importunate giver does not even pretend that he is giving you gifts because you want them . " You must take them , " said Ed . " For our sakes . " " Come now , " said Mary . " just to please us . Here . Give her some candy too . " " I do n't eat candy , " said Mrs. Gamp . She looked pleadingly at Mr. Gamp for assistance , but he stood by amiably and even held out his hand for some of the candy , which they now thrust into every nook and cranny of Mrs. Camp . " Oh thank you . Thank you , " said Mrs. Camp unhappily , her heart empty but her nooks and crannies full . " And a piece of the birthday cake , " said Mary . " You have to take it whether you want to or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an answer , " said Ed , thrusting a huge wax-papered slab under her free elbow . " I know , " said Mrs. Gamp , in bleak resignadon . " I ca n't thank you enough . It 's wonderful . And the flowers are beautiful . And thank you for the fabulous present and the candy . It 's such unusual candy . " " Let 's celebrate another fifty of these , " said Mr. Camp recklessly . " Good-by . " " Good-by . Thanks for coming . " Just as they were sidling out the front door , Mrs. Gamp slopped . " Ed , " she said , peering anxiously through the flowers at him , " I had thought of giving you an English walnut and black calfskin table with an inlaid chart showing free parking spots in the city . " " Oh , I have one , " said Ed . " Then it 's good I did n't give you another , " said Mrs. Gamp and pushed her way blindly out . As Mr. Camp helped her into the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " All the same , if we could just tell Ed we really like him , it would make a nice birthday present . " " Wrap it up , " said Mr. Gamp , " and send it . " " In some handkerchiefs , maybe , " she muttered , as he started the car , " with just one initial in the corner . "
