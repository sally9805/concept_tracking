At precisely 12:06 P.M. on December 3 a steel cylinder with the name Atlantis printed on it was lowered by winch from the deck of the ship Eureka into the Pacific Ocean . Inside the cylinder were two men . They were about to attempt a historic mission  --  tobecomethe first human beings literally to set foot on the Continental Shelf , approximately 1,000 feet below the surface . In a way it was to be the reverse equivalent of the first flight into space by Yuri Gagarin  --  that is , if Gagarin had tried to leave his capsule in flight to orbit briefly in nothing but his space suit . One of the two men in the cylinder made it . The other died . By 12:54 P.M. , 48 minutes after the descent had begun , another man involved in the operation had died too . Those minutes combined horror , scientific triumph , personal tragedy , mystery  --  and a controversy which still rages . The Atlantis , a so-called " submersible pressure chamber " designed to take its occupants to the floor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precise , 28-year-old Swiss mathematics teacher named Hannes Keller . Keller was aboard on that fateful mission . The other passenger was Peter Small , a 35-year-old British free-lance journalist and skin-diving enthusiast . Their triumph-tragedy took place 2 ' 2 miles west of Catalina Island off the coast of Southern California . And so we have two young men of completely different backgrounds coming together to Face death at a remote point alien to both of them . This is the stuff of which scientific adventures are made in the seventh decade of the 20th century . The events of December 3 really had their beginnings in the summer of 1958 , when Keller , teaching engineerine students in his native townof Winterthur , Switzerland , began casting about for a hobby . He tried and discarded flying because it was too expensive . Then a friend interested him in skin diving . Keller went to Greece for six months to practice his diving techniques . He says , " I soon learned that the basic problems still were unsolved in diving . The techniques and the apparatus were on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was impossible for a man breathing compressed air to descend much more than 300 feet without suffering a kind of rapture , a crippling mental and physical incompetence , and even death , due to poisoning by gases manufactured by his own body . Also , unless a man returned from the pressures of the depths very slowly , gas bubbles would form in has tissues causing what is known as ' the bends , ' resulting in intense pain , and possibly even death . ' " Putting his mathematical mind to work on the problem , Keller came up with the theory that a diver should breathe a combination of gases different from the mixture of nitrogen , oxygen , carbon dioxide , and so forth , which makes up ordinary air . He learned that a Swedish engineer named Zetterstrom had had the same theory and had successfully dived to 600 feet in 1947 , breathing a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen , but had died because of an error by his surface crew . ( The U.S. Navy was also experimenting with deep-diving breathing mixtures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep dives since the 1930 's . ) Keller went to see Dr. Albert Buehlmann at the University of Zurich . Buehlmann , a specialist in lung function and blood circulation , told Keller he believed that narcosis ( the state of profound stupor or unconsciousness suffered by divers at great depths ) was not caused by nitrogen , as generally supposed , but by carbon dioxide . Keller exclaimed , " If your theory is correct , then all other theories about diving are wrong . " Buehlmann agreed to help Keller and suggested what gases he should use . Breathing Buehlmann 's mixture of gases , Keller was lowered 400 feet to the bottom of Lake Zurich in a 40-gallon oil drum he had turned into an impromptu diving bell . Not only did he survive , but he suffered no narcosis symptoms and was able to return to the surface much more quickly , without developing the bends , than divers had ever done before . Untold Wealth Beyond Mart 's Reach Now convinced that he was on the right track , Keller fed 250,000 statistics into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ascent , for instance  --  for dives of up to 1,000 feet . Tliis is roughly the maximum depth of water covering the Continental Shelf , the unexplored area of 16,000 , - 000 square miles that surrounds all the great land masses of the world . The Continental Shelf is known to contain untold wealth in oil and minerals , all so far unobtainable by man because of his inability to work at such ocean depths . In 1960 , using his secret combination of gases , Keller successfully dived 500 feet in Italy 's Lake Maggiore . In 1961 , taking a passenger , he reached a record depth of 728 feet in Lake Maggiore and returned safely in 45 minutes . ( The previous record was a 600-foot descent by a British Navy helmet-equipped diver who , according to Keller , had to undergo 12 hours of decompression but still emerged with paralyzed arms . ) By now the U.S. Navy was extremely interested in Keller 's work . The Navy must think of future rescues of atomic submarines . Sixteen months ago the Navy gave Keller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dive oft Catalina , he designed and built the Atlantis , 7 feet high and 4H feet in diameter . Its bottom is a hatch through which its occupants , in frogmen suits , may leave and reenter , In Atlantis  --  unlike a submarine  --  the pressure is not artificially controlled , and it is the same as that in the surrounding water . Thus , its occupants receive no protection against the crushing weight of the water , and they can stay alive at great depths only by breathing Keller 's gas mixture . The chamber , in fact , partially fills with water as it submerges , rising sometimes well above the occupants ' knees . This is to allow for easy opening and closing of the hatch . Early in 1962 Keller met Peter Small . The slender , aesthetic-looking young British journalist had learned about Keller 's project and asked if he could go on the 1,000-foot dive . He flew to Zurich , and Keller tested him by taking him on a simulated 1,000-foot dive in a decompression chamber . Small came through that test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him on the Catalina dive . Small was to write about the experience for a British newspaper . Preliminary Trials Before the Dive On November I2 Keller arrived in Los Angeles . In his party were seven men who had handled the hoses and cables during all of his previous descents . Small arrived with his 21-year-old wife Mary , whom he had married just three months before . During the three weeks of preliminary tests two local skin divers joined the party . They were Richard Anderson and Christopher Whittaker , a British youth studying at U.C.L.A. They were signed on as " safety divers , " whose function was to stand by and check the Atlantis in the shallower depths if anything went wrong . Whittaker and Small had known each other in London , and they became fast friends during the preliminary trials . In one of these tests , just two days before the I , 000-foot dive , Small and Keller descended to the 300-foot level in the Atlantis . They remained there for an hour , swimming outside the chamber and checking the equipment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to remain even at that depth for that long . ) After the dive , Small complained of muscle pain , but he was placed in a decompression chamber for 414 hours , and when he emerged he seemed all right . Shortly after I 0 o'clock in the morning of December 3 the expedition set out in two ships from Avalon , on Catalina Island . Among the observers were three naval officers , all experts in the Navy 's experimental diving program . By 10:30 the ships had taken up station at a point where the Eureka 's fathomcter indicated the depth was a little over 1,000 feet . At 11:54 Keller and Small entered the bright-yellow Atlantis , wearing tight rubber suits . At 12:06 P.M. the Atlantis was lowered into the water , and Keller 's surface crew , headed by his close friend , a Swiss lawyer named Florian Niggli , and including Dr. Buehlmann , took control of the operation . Neither the naval officers nor the Shell Oil Company , which had supplied the Eureka and the decompression chamber , had anything to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's log , the Atlantis remained at the 16-foot level for six minutes while he and Small checked the equipment . At 12:12 Keller gave the signal , and the steel cable was quickly payed out from the Eureka . " At this point , " says Keller , " we were still hreathine the air in the chamber . Everything was going perfectly . We descended with water in the chamber up above our knees , but we kept the bottom hatch nearly closed so we would n't fall out . " At 12:22 , reports Keller 's log. the , 411aalis reached the 250-foot level , and he and Small switched over to breathing his gas mixture from the tanks strapped to their hacks . Each man 's tank was supposed to hold a 15-minute supply and could be replenished by plugging into a main tank attached to the chamber . " However , " says Keller , " we actually were not getting a full fifteen-minute supply , because there was a leak in the valve of the main tank , and it was only half full . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were getting maybe only five minutes ' worth of Ras at a time in our portable tanks . / knew this before the dive , but I did n't think it was important , because we still had reserves in the main tank for many hours . " The log indicates that the Atlantis remained at the 250-foot level for two minutes for a final check , and at 12:24 the two men commenced the final descent to the bottom . At 12:29 a weighted cable suspended beneath the chamber touched the ocean floor at 1,020 feet . That was the last entry in Keller 's log . Planting Flags on the Ocean Floor Says Keller , " When the cable touched bottom , leaving me just room enough to get out of the hatch , I pushed a blue-colored button which signaled to the surface that everything was OK . I tilled Peter 's apparatus with gas from the reserve tank . I checked my own apparatus and realized I had about three minutes of gas left . Instead of taking time to refill , I decided to work fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped out feet first . There was about five feet of water between the hatch and the bottom . My objective was to place a Swiss flag and an American flag on the bottom and then get back immediately into the chamber . But as I left the chamber , the flags got entangled in the breathing tubes of my face mask . They covered the mask and 1 could n't see . It was a very bad moment . It took me two minutes to get disentangled , and then I dropped the flags to the bottom . I knew I had to get back into the chamber immediately , which I did , and Peter and I closed the hatch . I should have refilled my apparatus from the auxiliary gas tank , but I was so dizzy that I could n't . All I could do was to open the air pressure valves to blow the water out of the chamber . Then I opened my face mask and took the mouthpiece away to breathe ordinary air , to prevent death from lack of oxygen . Peter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He failed to refill his own apparatus as he had been trained to do . In about thirty seconds after I had reentered the chamber , I lost consciousness . " This entire scene was witnessed on the surface through television cameras mounted in the chamber , and when Niggli saw Keller keel over , he immediately ordered the Atlantis raised . Two minutes or so later he saw Small pass out . As the chamber cable was reeled in , it brought to thesurface the upper end of the Atlantis 's 300-foot air hose , which was then connected to the ship 's air supply . This enabled the crew on the Eureka to measure the air pressure inside the chamber and they realized that the chamber was losing pressure somewhere . The ascent was halted at 200 feet  --  just six minutes after it had been on the bottom  --  because the danger period in decompression is from 200 feet to the surface , and if there were a leak in the capsule , any further rise would almost certainly kill Keller and Small . So Niggli held the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Anderson and Whittaker , to cheek . The skindivers reached the chamber , closed all its external valves and returned to the surface . The instruments showed there was still a leak . Anderson was sent down again . Whittaker appeared exhausted , and his nose was bleeding . One of the naval officers , Cmdr. Norval Nickerson , advised him against making the second dive , but he replied that Peter Small was his friend and he had to go . He and Anderson dived back down , and this time they discovered that the edge of Keller 's flipper had caught in the hatch and was preventing it from closing . Anderson cut away the protruding part of the flipper and the hatch slammed shut . Anderson remained with the chamber and sent Whittaker to the surface . Whittaker was never seen again . At 12:54 the Atlantis was taken aboard the Eureka and placed on the deck to commence a 6 ' - hour decompression procedure  --  much longer than usual , because Keller and Small had been breathing air instead of the gas mixture . The chamber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unconscious inside , lying on the hatch . At 1:05 Keller began to stir . He says , " I regained consciousness slowly . saw Peter lying there , and I cut his face mask away to make sure he was breathing . He was . I looked at his eye reflexes and I took his pulse . It was not strong , but the pulse was there . It was normal but slow . / got to the telephone and talked with Doctor Buehlmann on the deck . He told me what had happened and where we were . " Continues Keller : " At about 2:30 P.M. Peter awoke and talked to me . He said , ' How long was 1 unconscious ? ' We then had a normal conversation , and he asked me for something to drink . I put him on the phone and he talked to Doctor Buehlmann on the outside . The doctor asked him if he had any pain , and he said he had none  --  that he just felt terribly weak and exhausted . I felt that way too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's directions over the telephone . For example , he kept asking me to check the sensitivity of his skin by pinching him . Peter was still lying on the bottom hatch . He was very nervous and uncomfortable and kept changing his position every minute or so . He said lie was awfully hot , and I cut his rubber suit away and pulled off his underwear . Then he got cold and I covered him . " in the meantime the Eureka was racing to the Naval Station at Long Beach , California . When it arrived , a crane lifted the sealed Atlantis onto the pier . Decompression still was going on . Keller says , " About ten or fifteen minutes before I feltthem lifting the chamber , Peter fell asleep . The doctor asked me to keep checking his pulse and respiration , but I said I did n't want to disturb him . After we got to the dock , they asked me to move Peter off the hatch so they 'd be able to open it when the decompression was over . As I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no pulse or respiration . I pushed the black-colored emergency button and began mouth-to-mouth resuscitation . " The chamber was opened a few minutes later ; at 6:52 P.M. Small was rushed off in an ambulance . At 7:29 P.M. , he was pronounced dead-on-arrival ' ' at the Navy hospital ship , USS Haven . The Mystery of Peter Small 's Death And so the scientific venture ended under a cloud  --  with two fatalities  --  a little more than seven hours after it had begun in the bright noonday California sun . Since Whittaker 's body has not been found , there is no way of pinpointing the cause of his death . An autopsy showed Small 's tissues were riddled with gas bubbles . Keller , who suffered no ill effects from the experience , says , " The doctors who did the autopsy are naturally not informed about problems of diving . They found gas bubbles in all the body tissues and immediately thought that the bubbles killed Lim . They came to a wrong conclusion . If Peter was dead while still under pressure in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he did n't decompress as a living body would have . Any dead body , after being under pressure , develops bubbles in the tissues , and the presence of these bubbles does n't prove anything . " He adds that he did not develop bubbles or the bends . A top Navy medical expert confirms that Keller 's reasoning about bubble-formation after death " is basically sound . " But he says , " The fact that Keller did not develop gas bubbles or the bends does n't mean per se that Small did n't have them . They could have been caused in Small by an old injury impeding blood circulation in a joint , or even by a more excitable emotional reaction at the time of the crisis . " Keller believes that Small , in his weakened state and with poor circulation under decompression , might have died of cardiac failure . Dr. Theodore .1 . Curphey , Los Angeles County coroner , disagrees . On December 6 Doctor Curphey stated , " Peter Small died of gas embolism  --  similar to the bends  --  not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The coroner appointed a five-man committee of Navy and civilian diving experts to determine " whether or not standard safety procedures were flagrantly violated by Keller and his crew during the December 3 expedition . " Keller is determined to continue his research . He says . " Peter Small died while proving man can reach the Continental Shelf . I can only honor Peter 's memory by carrying on the work for which he sacrificed his life . Someday when a diver using my method descends a thousand feet to the Continental Shelf and attaches an air hose to refloat a disabled atomic submarine , the world will know that Peter Small died in order that hundreds of others might live .
