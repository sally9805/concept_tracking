THE PRESIDENCY <P> Last week President Johnson named U.S. Ambassador to Colombia Fulton Freeman as the new Ambassador to Mexico ; issued an executive order banning employment discrimination be cause of age in businesses with federal contracts ; wished a busy Lady Bird Happy Valentine 's Day via the mobile telephone in her White House limousine , and did a lot of dancing . <P> A Ragtime Two-Step . The light-footedness took place at two White House parties , the annual diplomatic corps reception , and a state dinner for Sir Alec Douglas-Home . Regardless of what the musicians played , samba , cha-cha-cha , Dixieland or waltz , Lyndon kept in time with a simple two-step . <P> He was best , said some of his partners , to Alexander 's Ragtime Band . <P> When the President offered his arm to U.P.I. Reporter Helen Thomas , she wrote in a first-person , " **27;912;TOOLONG " story , she was so flustered that she blurted : " ' Mr. President , the chandeliers are bright tonight . ' " This was a reference to Johnson 's drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He did n't smile , " said Reporter Thomas . " I guess it was the wrong thing to say . " <P> In Buster Browns . The President also last week flew to St. Louis to open that city 's celebration of its 200th birthday . From the airport he moved in a heavily guarded motorcade to the Mississippi river front to view a partially completed $10 million , 630-ft. - high steel arch that is rising in the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial , a National Park Service project . <P> At St. Louis University , Johnson told a crowd of 7,000 that he had been aware of St. Louis ' importance " since I wore my first pair of Buster Brown shoes , " a reference to the city 's shoe manufacturing complex , and announced that he had appointed the St. Louis Cardinals ' retired Star Stan Musial to be the new director of the President 's Council on Physical Fitness . Musial , 43 , succeeds Oklahoma Football Coach Charles B. ( " Bud " ) Wilkinson , who resigned to run for the U.S. Senate from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dinner attended by 2,100 , Johnson nearly struck out with the town 's baseball fans . His prepared text said : " St. Louis is-as your old saying goes-first in many things and no longer last in the American League . " Of course , St. LoUis has not been in the American League at all since the old Browns left for Baltimore after the 1953 season . Presidential aides there fore issued a correction changing the text to read , " No longer last in the National League . " But that was not much of an improvement , since the Cardinals , as every fan knows , won nine pennants and six World Series between 1926 and 1946 and have n't finished last since 1918 . By this time , the statement was so mixed up that Lyndon wisely deleted it from his speech .
