THE Democratic Party this week has to face up to the task of formulating a credible campaign policy on Viet Nam . But which Democratic Party ? And which policy ? <P> Lyndon Johnson loyalists can hardly be expected to suggest that the war has , after all , been a mistake , or to conjure up a speedy solution after so many years of searching for one . Hubert Humphrey 's adherents , while professing residual loyalty to Johnson 's policies , must at the same time proffer some hope for an early and tenable peace . Eugene McCarthy and George McGovern , though nominally rivals , will continue to urge approximately similar terms for ending the war posthaste . <P> All approaches are clouded by the enigmatic status of the war itself . No one , from Paris to Washington to Saigon , can say with any certitude at this point whether the recent reduction of military activity in South Viet Nam represents a planned de-escalation by Hanoi or whether it presages yet another all-out offensive . <P> The prevailing , but by no means unanimous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regrouping and re-equipping its forces in preparation for a new assault . This has been the history of previous lulls-and " lull " is a relative term . Fierce fighting continues , and at the end of last week Communist-initiated ground action was accelerating . U.S. military commanders in Viet Nam , pointing to the massive infiltration of troops ( 150,000 so far this year ) from the North , believe that the big attack will come any day and that the main thrust will be aimed at Sai gon itself . <P> Accepting this premise , the White House , along with Secretary of State Dean Rusk , has been in no mood to yield to the North Vietnamese demand that the U.S. halt all bombing of the North as the price of advancing the Paris negotiations . Rather , Washington insists that Hanoi make some parallel gesture . " All they have to do , " said Defense Secretary Clark Clifford last week , " is get word to us that they have reduced the level of combat and will continue to reduce the level of combat , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants is private or public assurances from Hanoi to the effect that it intends to reduce , or at least not increase , its war effort . Barring that , some concrete evidence , such as a reduction in infiltration , could be taken as a token of good faith . To date , Clifford pointed out , there has been no recognizable " clear signal . " <P> One Little Note . Some other officials take a less rigid stand . Averell Harriman and Cyrus Vance , the U.S. negotiators in Paris , think that the time may be at hand to try a bombing pause . Humphrey too , in private Administration deliberations , has been arguing for a pause . He is inclined to take the lull at face value , to accept it as a pacific gesture of sufficient weight to justify a bombing suspension . In public , of course , he can not break with the Johnson Administration . Yet Humphrey clearly is continuing to edge toward a more conciliatory position , in the process attempting to come out on the left of Richard Nixon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
