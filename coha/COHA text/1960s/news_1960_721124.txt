txt Logan , W. Va. , March 14 ( UPD  --  Rescue teams suffered two heartbreaking reverses Monday in their search for 18 miners trapped for more than six days in a fireswept mine 8 miles southwest of here . The first and most serious disappointment came just before nightfall when the crews broke thru to the first area where the miners might have sought refuge from the choking fumes  --  and found it empty , except for two dinner buckets and ' some machinery . Push Toward Other The rescue workers then pushed toward the second area , 1,200 feet farther into the mine and 2 miles from the pit head , where the miners might have barricaded themselves agairst the gases which filtered thru the passages of the Holden No. 22 mine of the Island Creek Coal company . After probing about 600 feet closer to the second area , the disaster teams suffered the second setback of the day - deadly smoke and gaswhich forced them back to the first area about .7 p. m . A new fresh air base was being established and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Find Dinner Pails Before being forced , back , the workers found additional dinner buckets which Crawford L. Wilson , state mines chief , said substantiated his belief that the men had gathered in one spot . , But the inch-by-inch progress made in the rescue efforts dimmed chances of finding the miners unharmed . Earlier the rescue workers had pushed to within 80 feet of the area only to be blocked by the cinder wall which formed part of the mine 's ventilation system . A special four man unit went into the pit to tear down the wall . During normal operations the wall could be bypassed thru adjacent passageways that are now smoke filled .
