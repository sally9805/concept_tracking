In response to Washington 's battle against inflation , the cost of borrowing from U.S. banks last week climbed to a historic high . For the third time in six weeks , major banks raised their prime rate , the interest that they charge their best corporate customers for loans . The latest increase , from 6% to 7% , is in tended to help curb the nation 's overexuberant economy by making credit so costly that businessmen will borrow and spend less . Because they operate in directly , such restraints at best take effect only after a time lag of weeks or months . The immediate impact fell on the securities markets , forcing bond yields up and stock prices down . <P> On the New York Stock Exchange , the Dow-Jones industrial average sank for the fourth straight week . A 26-point loss reduced the average to 925 , wiping out all its gains since mid-September . From its early December peak , the Dow has slipped 60 points , or 6% . Brokers generally see little on the economic horizon to provide much cheer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit is beginning to affect consumers as well as businessmen . In California , the giant Bank of America and several savings and loan associations lifted their minimum interest rate on home mortgages from 7% to 7% . At week 's end Manhattan 's First National City Bank increased by one-fourth of 1% its charges for auto , consumer and home-improvement loans . The true annual interest rates on some personal loans rose to more than 13% . <P> Interest rates have been climbing since early December because the Federal Reserve Board deliberately put banks into a squeeze . The board raised from 5% to 5% the rate at which bankers themselves can borrow from the Federal Reserve . But it made no change in the 6% ceiling on the interest that banks are allowed to pay on large time deposits , which account for about $23 billion in U.S. banks . As money rates in the open market spurted above 6% , New York City banks alone lost almost $1 billion in such funds as corporate treasurers took advantage of the higher return available on bonds and even U.S. Treasury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as $4 billion more during the first three months of this year . <P> Aiming at Business . The last time funds drained out of lending institutions at such a rate was just before the crisis that bankers call the " 1966 credit crunch . " Bond prices crashed , the Dow-Jones average plunged 18% , and mortgage money grew so scarce that housing starts fell to a postwar low . Though some pessimists fear that all this could happen again , the banks have considerably more cash on hand in 1969 than in 1966 . The Federal Reserve is also using its monetary weapons with more finesse . <P> As the board sees it , the fundamental inflationary pressure on the economy lately has come from spending by business . The board has therefore aimed its credit pinch at the chief source of corporate loans : the commercial banks . <P> Besides raising the cost of money , the Federal Reserve has been acting to constrict the nation 's money supply . For much of 1968 , the Reserve Board allowed the money stock to grow at an annual rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 , the money supply rose at a 3.6% annual rate . By any measure , that amounts to a significant-if so far brief-squeeze.
