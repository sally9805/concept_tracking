The news from Pittsburgh is that the raffish Steelers are being transformed into a disciplined team that drinks its Ovaltine and says its prayers in plenty of time for the 11 o'clock curfew , and there is a certain sadness in the thought , as there might be if a rowdy old burlesque house were razed to make way for a supermarket . The man responsible for the Steelers ' uncharacteristic restraint is the new coach , Bill Austin , who formerly cracked an assistant 's whip for the league 's toughest boss , Vince Lombardi , at Green Bay . But the Steelers will be no more than disciplined losers this season . What Austin got was just about the most terrible team in modern NFL football . Until he can find more able hands , Pittsburgh will be a tight ship with no visible helmsman and alarming noises in the engine room . // Who 's to steer the Steelers ? The quarterbacks  --  to begin with the worst of the team 's manifold problems  --  have been young and overeager . In camp only one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to throw deep accurately . All have been slow in reading defenses , hesitant about switching to audibles , unintimidating as runners and tardy setting up for throwing . Nor has any of them assumed command of the team as a quarterback must . Bill Nelsen , with only one full season of experience , is on a shaky deck as No. 1 ; he is indecisive and his sense of timing  --  his judgment of that fleeting moment when a receiver is breaking clear  --  is faulty . Tommy Wade looks no better . Stofa was given a long look but was released , and last week the Steelers picked up the No. 3 Green Bay quarterback , Ron Smith . // If someone can get the ball to them , however , the receivers are O.K. Five outside receivers are now or potentially of the caliber of ex-Steelers Jimmy Orr and Buddy Dial : Gary Ballman , Roy Jefferson , Paul Martha ( after a laborious apprenticeship ) , Jerry Simmons and rookie J. R. Wilburn . They are saying that Jefferson , a second-year man , can become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fluid his moves , so remarkable his speed . The tight ends , sophomore John Hilton and rookie Tony Jeter , are powerful and fast , if green . // But even if the Steelers do get the ball to the receivers , who 's to run to vary the attack ? John Henry Johnson is gone , and Austin may have to depend upon those plodding veterans , Dick Hoak and Mike Lind , as his starters . Oldtimer Clarence Peaks has shed 20 of his 238 pounds and may be useful , but No . I draft-choice Dick Leftridge has been put behind schedule by an infection . Some mild hope centers on youngsters Jim Butler and Willie Asbury. // And who 's to block for them ? Oldsters Ray Lemek , Mike Sandusky , Art Hunter and Charlie Bradshaw have worn out ; so the interior line will be made up of rookie Pat Killorin at center , rookie Larry Gagner and veteran Mike Magac at guard and Lloyd Voss , acquired from the Packers , and veteran Dan James at tackle . This may be as weak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At least the defense is respectable . The line includes two strong ends , John Baker and Ben McGee . The tackles will come from a sturdy but cumbersome trio of Riley Gunnels , Chuck Hinton and Ken Kortas . These men are punishing to run against but a trifle slow on the pass rush . Baker and McGee will get there , but the tackles will be important strides too late . // The Steeler linebackers are better than average . Gene Breen returns in the middle with Andy Russell , back from a two-year Army hitch and in top condition , and John Campbell or Rod Breedlove at the corners . Rookie Dave Tobey is a spare linebacker/ center . The defensive backs are also sound . Corner Man Brady Keys can cover any receiver man to man . Bob Hohn , the second-year man playing opposite him , is coming along well , and the veteran Willie Daniel is available . Deep are Clendon Thomas , a fast man . with an interception three years ago before he was shifted , against his will , to tight end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used in an emergency , as can Martha and Simmons from the offensive platoon . // For the first time since 1957 the Steelers have been ordered to work on fundamentals  --  timing , footwork , blocking and tackling . The overweights have been de-plumped , the receivers are running strict pass patterns for a change and all are managing to live with that strictly enforced 11 p.m. curfew . // Austin prefers instinctive reactions and quickness to mere size and demands blockers who crack and hit rather than drive and steer . Where the departed Buddy Parker fostered rivalry between the offensive and defensive platoons , Austin is promoting a feeling of unity and team spirit . The players definitely prefer it Austin 's way . The rest of the football world always chuckled over the anecdotes trickling out of Dante 's , the team hangout , as the town 's swinging losers took refreshment , but the stories never seemed very funny to the suffering Pittsburgh fans . As they knew , pro football came to consider the town as the end of the line . Players traded to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ players and by themselves . Management persisted in the risky practice of trading off draft choices to the point of folly . As recently as 1964 there was enough strength left in the team to make it a rough opponent  --  it gave the proud Giants some lovely bruises  --  but then the erosion accelerated . It would seem that the Austin era is beginning none too soon . // The most optimistic Steeler fans concede that the team will be out of the Eastern race early but insist that , improving steadily , it will develop into a fairly effective force by November . There is talk of a late-season spurt to as high as third place . But if morale fails during the inevitable shuffles that Austin will make , Pittsburgh may again reside near the bottom of the division .
