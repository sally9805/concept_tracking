 | As far as the eye could see in both directions the two lines of overladen overheated greenclad men picked and stumbled their way along the edges of the river of mud . A Fourth of July excitement spread electric tentacles everywhere . Working parties , when they paused to ease their muscles , looked always toward the road . Men with nothing to do came out from their bivouacs to watch , and stood in clusters in the edge of the coconut trees , talking . Only a very few , possessors of more brass than the majority of men , ventured out to stare more closely . ' These marked the individual faces of the gasping marchers , as if wanting to memorize them . But except for the ghouls there was a curious respectfulness . Occasionally , rarely , some watcher would call out an encouragement . His answer , if he got any at all , would be a half wave of a hand , or a quick dark look and a forced grin . The marchers needed every spark of concentration they possessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own . After an hour 's marching , even such private thoughts were displaced . The infantry forgot where it was going in the urgent immediate problem of getting there , of keeping going without dropping out . Not all solved it . Slowly a new line was forming on each side , between the watchers and the road . Suddenly a marching man would turn aside and step out of line and sit or fall down . Others simply fainted . These were generally dragged aside by the men behind them . Sometimes the already exhausted pulled them over . Almost always all of this was ( lone in silence . Once in a while some still-marching man might call out hopefully to a beaten friend . But that was all . The watchers in the halfshade of the trees did not offer to help . And the stricken themselves seemed to prefer it that way . Few even attempted to crawl into the shade . They simply sat , dulleyed and lolling back in their packs as if sitting in armchairs ; or lay in their packs on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shuck out of their packs , stretched flat on their backs with fluttering eyelids . C-for-Charlie Company 's march was one of seven and a half miles . At eleven in the morning , with a last look back at the slit trenches , kitchen fly and tied-down storage tents which served them as home , they moved out for the road edge to await a gap in the stream of moving men . They arrived at their assigned guide point at seven-  | thirty and nearly dusk , half dead , and by eight were encamped there in the jungle beside the road . Over forty-five percent of them had fallen out ; and the last of the stragglers , heat prostrations and breakfast vomiters did not cease coming in till after midnight . It was an incredible march . No one in C-for-Charlie , including the old timers who had hiked in Panama and the Philippines , had ever experienced anything like it . Early in the morning Bugger Stein had had hopes  --  had dreamed  --  of bringing his company in full strength without a man missing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commander and report to him that he for one was all present and accounted for . When the head of the column , with Stein still shakily in the lead , turned in off the road , Stein could only laugh at himself bitterly . Tired and shaky and still sweating after checking the platoon areas , he walked alone along the road to the battalion CP further up ahead nearer the river , to report . He had had a strange hystericky encounter with his clerk Fife on the march . It had upset Stein , then had made him hotly furious with injured ego . Now it colored his blue mood as he walked along the road in the gathering twilight . The whole thing was strange . To take eight and a half hours to march seven and a half miles was strange enough . Add to that the terrain and it was stranger still : that march through the coconut groves with those people standing around watching like a bunch of frustrated gravediggers : after that striking the Trail and marching inland always between two crowding , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marching almost six hours by then , and everyone was near-hysterical . At the front of the column four of the cook force had already fallen out , and two of the company headquarters : little Bead and a new man , a draftee named Weld who because of his age had been attached to the headquarters group as a sort of combination runner and assistant clerk . All these were somewhere behind . Overhead , birds squawked or made piercing , ironic whistles which seemed specifically directed at the marchers . Fife had been complaining for some time in a gasping , painful , wildly emotional voice that he did n't think he could go on . Then ,  | after a ten break , he had not gotten up right away with the rest . Stein had turned to him thinking to help , to encourage . " Up you come , Fife . Come on , boy . You do nt want to give up now . Not after you 've made it this far . On those poor old aching feet . " The reaction he got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaped up . As if stabbed in the ass with a needle . On quivering legs , quivering all over , he broke out in a mad fit of rage and abuse . " You ! You tell me ! Whadda you tell me ! I 'll be walking when you 're on your back ! I 'll be going when you and all these other guys ? " his head described a wild arc ? " are on your knees and out ! You and any other goddamned officer ! " With trembling fingers he was getting back into his pack . " Shut up , Fife ! " Stein had said sharply . " Any goddamned fucking officer in the world ! I 'll walk till I drop dead  --  and when I do , I 'll be ten feet in front of your dead body ! Do n't you ever worry about me quitting ! " There had been more of this sort of talk . Staggering in his pack , Fife had lurched out onto the edge of the road . He did not shut up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to him to make an issue or not make one . Fife was past the point of caring . Stein knew the theory of slapping an hysterical man back into his senses , but he had never actually done it himself . He was a little hesitant to try it , fearing that somehow it might not work . Or of course he could have put him under arrest and charged him . He had plenty of charges . Stein decided to do neither . In silence he walked to his place at the head of the column and raised his arm and the company moved out . They were marching in two lines now , here on this narrower road in the jungle , one line on either side . Two files behind him Stein could hear life as Ile continued to curse and rage . Nobody else seemed to care , or paid much attention , they were all too tired . But Stein could not be sure he had not lost face with his company by deciding to ignore Fife . This tormented him and inside his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After a while Fife ceased of himself . The column marched in silence . On the other side out of the corner of his eye Stein could see Sergeant  | Welsh . ( He had sent Band to the rear to try to cut down the straggling . ) Welsh marched along with his head down , communing with some element of himself , and looking as though he were out for a walk and had felt no fatigue all day . He took frequent gargles from his Listerine bottle of gin , which infuriated Stein . As if Welsh was fooling anybody . At the side of the road in the thick leaves , almost in Stein 's ear , some mad tropic bird screamed at them irritably , then whistled shrilly as though it had seen a woman . His anger when it came on him , marching , had not come until some little time after Fife subsided . But when it came it was potent . His neck swelled and his whole head burned inside his helmet . He was so furiously angry it blurred his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie there and howl senselessly . He hated them , all of them . You break your ass trying to look after them , be a father to them . And all they do is hate you for it , and for being an officer , with a hard , ignorant , stubborn endurance . Fife had not fallen out . Stein continued along the twilit road . He was sunk in a morose melancholy . To be honest , he had to admit he carried a certain guilt about Fife . He had always had rather mixed feelings about him . That he was an intelligent boy he had no doubt . And he had made him corporal nine months back because of this , and because he did his work well  --  even though this meant an assistant squad leader had to remain a Pfc . In addition to this , Stein had allowed Fife two mornings a week off to attend some courses at the university in the town where the division was stationed , when the new law giving free tuition to servicemen first came out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had proved that . ) But he could not help feeling Fife was emotionally unstable . He was flighty , and inclined to be overimaginative . Highly emotional , he lacked the ability to control his emotions which might have given him good judgment . Of course he was still only a boy . But after all he was twenty . Stein did not know his background in detail , but he felt that somewhere along the line ( mother feelings ; defeated father competition ; suchlike ) Fife had become a case of arrested adolescence . There were so many like that in America today . In the Civil War men of twenty had led regiments , even divisions . In practice  | in the company none of this made any difference . The boy did his work and except for an occasional angry flare-up at Welsh ( for which nobody could be blamed ! ) kept his mouth shut . But it was because of all this that Stein had felt he could not wholeheartedly recommend Fife for Officers ' Candidate School . Back when War Department was deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OCS , Stein had encouraged a number of his high school graduates and more intelligent noncoms to apply . Almost all were accepted and all but two graduated with commissions . One day in the orderly room , in a moment of inspiration coupled to a misdirected desire to do good works , he had suggested to Fife that Fife apply for the Administrative School  --  as distinct from the Infantry School , because given Fife 's personality as Stein read it , Stein did not believe Fife would make a good infantry officer . Fife 's first reaction was to balk and refuse ; and Stein should have left it at that . But to Stein it was obvious that Fife was imitating his hero Welsh who , whenever he was approached about OCS , merely snorted and looked as though he were going to spit on the floor . So later Stein tried again ; because he felt it was for the good of the Army , as well as Fife . The second time was what tore it . It still made Stein angry to think about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had changed his mind , that he would apply , but that he would not apply to the Administrative School ; if he was going to be an officer at all , he said with some highly tragic emotionality Stein did not clearly understand , he wanted to be an infantry combat officer . Stein did not know what to do . Ile ( lid not want to come out and tell Fife to his face he did n't believe he would make a good infantry officer . This was the position he had got himself in by trying to do good works , to help the Army and Fife . In the end he helped Fife fill out his application and signed it and sent it in . After all , every soldier had a legal right to apply . But Stein did not feel he himself had any moral right to be dishonest in his recommendation . He sent in his character analysis of Fife and his honest opinion , which was that he did not think Fife would make a good infantry officer . It was the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came back immediately . To it was affixed a note 11om the Regimental S-i saying : What the hell ? Do n't give me all this Pro and Con crap , Jim . If you do n't think a soldier will make a good Officer , why the hell send me his application ? I got more papers than I can take care of now . Stein was again angered , as well as embarrassed , this time . If the son of a bitching S-1 , whom Stein knew well as a drinking buddy at the club , did n't know every soldier had a legal right to apply , he was stupid ; and if he did know it , he was immoral . Once again Stein was placed in the position of not knowing what to do . He filed the application away without mentioning it to Fife , and once again tried to get him to apply for the Administrative School . Fife refused . He said he preferred to wait until he heard from the first one , and that was what he proceeded to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it all was that Fife found the application , with Stein 's character analysis of him , and the S-i 's note . Two weeks before they were to leave they cleaned out all their papers . Fife , cleaning out Stein 's personal files , found it in a bunch of other papers . Stein , sitting at his desk , had reached out and grabbed it , saying it was something of his , and had locked it away . But not before , Stein was sure , Fife had had a good chance to run through it . At any rate Fife had looked at him with a very odd look on his face . As usual Welsh was there grinning , missing nothing . But then , with another of those high  --  and usually tragic  --  emotionalities which Stein could never fully understand though he could sense them , Fife went on with his work and said nothing . And he had not said anything , from that day to this . Had never mentioned it . But of course it did n't take any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what was behind his outburst of today . The enlisted man 's viewpoint ! It was this unfairness which angered and so infuriated Stein . Now , though , he felt only blue . It was always a shock to rediscover how much enlisted men hated you , because you tended to try to forget it . And tomorrow he would be taking them in . He felt very inadequate . Especially when he recalled how badly the march had gone today . He had been horrified and shocked by what had happened . None of his officers or platoon sergeants had fallen  | out on him . They knew better than to . But when Stein thought about the number of big , tough men in his outfit who had given up , or for that matter simply fainted dead away , it left him with a dark foreboding for the future . When an undermuscled , essentially puny man like himself could keep going and these guys could not , it did not speak well for the conditioning of his company , physical or mental . Ile had tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , God knew . Great God , what would the heat and exhaustion and tension of combat itself do to them ! He did not , of course , when he reported , say anything to the battalion commander about any of this ; and when he did report , he discovered to his surprise that his forty-five percent straggling was in fact the best mark made in the battalion . It did not make him feel any better . He accepted the battalion commander 's rather sour congratulations with a tired grimace . Then he walked back along the darkening road looking slowly and with thoughtful care at the tall trees and fat-leafed jungle undergrowth . With a flashlight Stein held a briefing for his officers and platoon sergeants in front of his little sleeping tent . It made his heart feel funny in his chest to be doing it . First Battalion would be in reserve most of the morning unless called . In the afternoon they would move forward to take over the positions on the hills which 2d Battalion was supposed by then to have gained . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stein studied their faces . Welsh was there of course , but the clerk Fife who should have been on hand in case Stein needed him , was nowhere to be seen . Probably he was embarrassed . Well , it did n't matter . Ile did n't need him . And there was no tactical reason why Fife should hear the dispositions . Stragglers were still coming in . Stein had already resigned himself to the fact that he was not going to get much sleep tonight . The reason Fife was not present at Bugger Stein 's briefing was because he had gone for a walk in the jungle . It had nothing to do with embarrassment . Not only was Fife not embarrassed by his outburst of the afternoon , he was rather proud of it . He had not thought he was that brave . And the reason he had gone for a walk in the jungle alone had to do with the fact that , having pleased and surprised himself with his own courage like that , he had then discovered that it was all meaningless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might very well be dead by this time tomorrow , whether he was courageous or not today was pointless , empty . When compared to the fact that he might be dead tomorrow , everything was pointless . Life was pointless . Whether he looked at a tree or not was pointless . It just did n't make any difference . It was pointless to the tree , it was pointless to every man in his outfit , pointless to everybody in the whole world . Who cared ? It was not pointless only to him ; and when he was dead , when he ceased to exist , it would be pointless to him too . More important : Not only would it be pointless , it would have been pointless , all along . This was an obscure and rather difficult point to grasp . Understanding of it kept slipping in and out on the edges of his mind . It flickered , changing its time sense and tenses . At those moments when he understood it , it left him with a very hollow feeling . Because from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had risen a certain , sure knowledge that tomorrow , or at least within the next few days , he would be dead . This had filled Fife with such a huge sadness that he forgot all about the dispositions conference and simply walked off by himself , into the jungle to look at all the things which would continue to exist after he had ceased to . There were a lot of them . Fife looked at them all . They remained singularly unchanged by his scrutiny . It really made no difference what he did , or whether he did anything . Fife did not believe in God . He did not disbelieve in God . It was just that it was a problem which did not apply to him . So he could not believe he was fighting this war for God . And he did not believe he was fighting it for freedom , or democracy , or the dignity of the human race . When he analyzed it , as he tried to do now , he could find only one reason why he was here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people to think he was a coward , embarrassed to be put to jail . That was the truth . Why it was the truth , when he had already proved to himself that it made no difference what he did or whether he did anything , he could not say . It was just the fact . Fife had unslung his rifle when he left the camp , because they had been warned there might be Japanese infiltrators this close to i be front . He had not seen anything move anywhere , but as the dusk  | in the jungle deepened he began to get a little bit edgy . He knew this ground had been fought over only a week ago , but from the look of it he might have been the first man ever to set foot here . And yet some man , another American , might have been killed here where he himself now stood . Fife tried to imagine it . He gripped his rifle tighter . The eerie stillness of the jungle thickened around him as the daylight failed . Quite suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tonight . Hell , he might get shot by some uiggerhappy sentry . Without waiting longer , and forgetting about his conviction that he would be dead soon so that nothing mattered , he turned and started legging it back to camp , glad to be returning to the presence of his own breed . The sentries had not yet been posted . The sergeant in charge of the guard was just rounding them up . Fife stared at them a moment wildly , as if they were not real , thinking how narrowly he had escaped being killed by one of them with his foolish emotionalism , then reported to Stein 's sleeping tent . There he was told by ' Welsh , who was preparing to bed down nearby , to take the hell off and go to bed . For a moment , just for a moment , Fife thought of asking him for something , some assurance . He wanted to . But then he realized he did not know what to ask him for , or how to phrase what he wanted to say , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be given ? He did n't want anyone to think he was a nervous sissy , or a coward . So instead of speaking , he shrugged elaborately at Welsh , though feeling that his face did not look right , looked too scared , and turned and walked away . welsh , who was sitting crosslegged in front of his tent with his rifle across his knees , stared after hint with crinkled eyes until the boy limped from sight around a tree . From beneath the black brows the eyes themselves glinted . So the kid was finally learning how important he was to the world . NVelslt sniffed . Taken him long enough . It was a concept any intelligent child ought to understand readily . Only , they just did n't like to . So now he was learning it the hard way . Hurts , do n't it . Scares you a little bit , hunh . Shock to the system . Make anybody constipated . In a way Welsh sympathized with him . But there was nothing he could do about it . Nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back and get born dumb . Property , kid ; all for property . Everybody dies ; and what 's it all about ? In the end , what 's everything about ? What remains ? Property . Welsh went back to cleaning and checking his rifle . He had already gone over his new Thompsongun and the pistol he had pre-empted from MacTae 's supply room . And if they had handed out sawed-off shotguns , he would have had one of those . He had to hurry with the rifle , it was almost too dark . Satisfied finally , he held it up in both hands and sighted along it off through the trees . Give him the Garand anytime . Let the romantic kids have the Springfields and spotweld BAR clips on them . The Marines had to do that . He 'd take the Garand . Give him the firepower , and you could keep your pinpoint accuracy . This was going to be the age of firepower , not accuracy . Welsh dropped the rifle back onto his thighs and dangled his hands from his knees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A goat would do . Or a clean old man . Crosslegged , his rifle across his lap , Welsh sat and stared off into the ( lark trees . Fife did not sleep much either . But it was for a different reason than either Stein or Welsh . When lie left Welsh , he hunted up a ration stack . His conviction that he would be dead tomorrow or the day after did not stop hunger . He ate a cold can of C ration Meat &; Beans sitting on the ground outside his tent , mashing the solid food between his jaws with relish . Then he crawled in and lay down , his heart pounding when he suddenly thought about tomorrow . Die ? Why , he had never seen Nice and Monte Carlo . It was twenty minutes after this that little Bead , who had fallen out on the march today , came crawling in . Fife had seen him earlier , down by the first platoon , visiting some kid draftee friend of his . When he heard him now , he rolled over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asleep . Bead scrambled in under the net without a word , and turned to his own side ignoring Fife in return . They lay like that for a long time , in silence , while the camp settled down around them . Then they lay for an even longer time in the quiet that followed . The air in the tent was stiff with pretended sleep . Finally Bead moved . He rolled over and said in a hoarse voice :  | " Well , what about it ? " Fife made no answer , and continued to pretend he was sleeping . " I said , well what about it ? " Bead said again finally , more harshly . Fife did not answer . " I do n't see that either one of us 's got anything to lose . Not by now . And it might be the last time of anything for both of us . " Bead 's voice was hoarse , as though it were being pulled out of him , and was not without a bitter undercurrent . His breathing was loud in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Bead said nothing further . He had rolled over and was now facing Fife 's back . He did not roll back . His breathing continued loud . " I got one on , and you do too , " little Bead from Iowa said finally , with a kind of fierce honesty . It was true . In a way that was answer enough . Slowly Fife rolled over toward him . They were now lying face to face , about a foot between them . Fife could just barely make out Bead 's face in the dim light . Bead 's pale blue eyes seemed to collect the meager light and illuminate his face with it . " Well ? " Bead said . " Well what ? " Fife said irascibly . " One of us has got to turn end for end . " What the hell ? Bead had brought it up , let him do the turning . There was a rustle and Bead 's face disappeared from in front of him . Fife waited . Thoughtfully he ran his tongue over his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knees , appeared in front of his face . Curiously enough , Fife during the next minutes was thinking about his girlfriend at the university in town whom he had never been able to seduce , remembering her vividly , almost physically . She was a large girl with heavy breasts , big thighs , muscular buttocks , and a protuberant mops Veneris , all of which he had felt through her clothes just once one passionate night , but never had seen . He had not been able to seduce her , but he had received four fervid love letters from her since the division left for combat . He had answered two , with appropriately tragic letters for a young infantryman about to die soon , but after the third the effort was too painful . It was easy for her to write that she now regretted she  | had not given herself to him when she had the chance ; but for Fife to read it was almost unbearable . And long-range sympathy gained him nothing . Still , on occasion he liked to remember the way she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , juicier , than any whore he had ever been to bed with . Fife did not , on the other hand , like to remember how this business with Bead had got started . But there were times , like tonight , when he could not avoid it . It had started the second night on the island , in fact . The first night was the night of the day it rained so hard , also the first they had ever bunked together in a sheltertent . The second night was much drier ; more comfortable . Bugger Stein still had not found the company 's big tents . It was Bead who broached the subject . He had come crawling in at a moment when Fife , already disrobed to his underwear , had been thinking ardently about girls . Fife was embarrassed , but Bead made no comment . However while he undressed he began to complain about what a hardship it was for him to be where he was denied the services of women . They had often been on pass together , Fife and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the town where the division was stationed , and had Fife not noticed it ? Well , he was a very horny type , little Bead said , and he needed lots of sex . At eighteen this may well have been true ; and Bead had stated it many times before ; but Fife could not help feeling Bead perhaps bragged a little . Anyway , for Bead , the worst thing about this whole war was that , he said . And what the hell could a guy do ? Nothing , that was what . Beat it . Or do without . Unless guys helped each other out now and then . It was either that , or find yourself a queer cook or baker someplace , or it was nothing . Guys could help each other out , Bead supposed . " You know , like the things you used to do together when you were kids in school , " he grinned , shyly . That was all he said . He had finished undressing down to his shorts . Then he lay down on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about girls and whores in that almost childish tenor which at eighteen he had not yet lost . Finally he stopped the talking also , There was a long pause . Then he rolled over to face Fife .  | " Well , what do you say ? " he said cheerfully . " Shall we help each other out ? I 'll do it to you if you 'll do it to me . " Fife had divined what was coming . Nevertheless he pretended surprise and confusion . But he already knew that he was going to accept . And Bead , finding that he was not rebuffed , now became more confident in his voice and in his salesmanship . Apparently it made no difference to him and did not worry him that he was suggesting something homosexual . And perhaps , being eighteen and just out of school , he did n't see it that way . But that could not be entirely true , Fife speculated later , because as he started to crawl over to Fife 's side of the little tent he stopped and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I 'm no queer , or nothing like that . " " Well , do nt you get the idea I am , either , " Fife had answered . Fife thought about his lost girl that time , too . He thought about her every time . There were n't many more times . There was that first night , the second night on the island , and the following night which was the third night on the rock . On the fourth day the company 's tents were found , the puptents were struck , and everybody moved into the larger eight-man tents . After that , opportunity was lacking . Once , one single time , on an afternoon when Welsh was gone and there was no work for them to do , they had gone off for a walk in the jungle , knowing beforehand what they were going to do but not mentioning it , so that when it happened off there alone in the massive , high-arching jungle , it seemed to both of them to come as a complete surprise . But that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . It had of course changed their relationship . Fife to his own surprise found himself becoming more and more authoritarian with his little assistant than he had ever dared be with anyone in his life . He gave hint curt orders , cursed hint out for the slightest thing , criticized him constantly , insulted him more and more frequently , used him as his perpetual butt ; in short , more and more treated Bead as he himself hated to be treated by Welsh . Bead on the other hand seemed to understand this , and moreover accepted it as though he felt it in some way to be his due . He accepted Fife 's insults in silence , carried out his repeated orders as best he could ,  | and received his constant criticism quietly without anger or answering back . And yet all this time Fife was not really angry at him for anything . Bead seemed to know this . Fife knew it , too . But his reaction was an emotional response he could neither understand nor control . After Bead had gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awake staring into the darkness . He had given up trying to sort it all out . All he knew was that he did not feel guilty about what he did with Bead . He felt he ought to feel guilty . But the truth was that he did n't . After all , what was the difference between doing the same things now that you did as a kid , and doing them when you were a freshman or sophomore . Only all the talk you had heard in the meantime about fairies and queers . Fife knew there were oldtimers in the army who had their young boyfriends whom they slept with as with a wife . In return , the young soldiers received certain favors from their protectors , not the least of which was more money to spend on women in town . None of this buggering was considered homosexual by anyone and authority turned a blind eye to it . But that was buggering . On the other hand there were the overt homosexuals , much increased since the drafting of civilians , whom everybody disliked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was the type company commanders tried to get rid of whenever a levy of men was demanded . These two types constituted the extent of Fife 's knowledge . He could not honestly place himself among them , but was terrified that someone else might . On this night before his outfit went into its first combat he lay awake a long time , wondering whether he was a homosexual . Every now and then his heart would jump suddenly when he remembered he had never seen Nice or Monte Carlo . Anyway , he knew he liked girls . Almost everyone was up at dawn . At the very first light which filtered down to them from the high trees men began crawling out , taking down their tents , rolling their packs . No orders had to be given them . Some , still afflicted with the American cleanliness complex , poured water from their canteens onto their toothbrushes to brush their teeth . Most did not . A few others remembered to powder their feet . There was very little horseplay , and a subdued air hung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Breakfast was a simple affair . There were C ration stacks around everywhere , and each man simply went to one of them when he felt like eating and took what he wanted . After eating , they settled down on their packs to wait . Dawn had come shortly before five o'clock . It was after eightthirty when an out-of-breath guide appeared with orders for them to move . While they had waited they could hear if not see other outfits moving invisibly into or out of other positions all around then in the jungle . Gasping infantry companies kept straggling past on the road . Now , led by the guide ( who had regained his breath ) they moved out onto the road behind a company from their own third battalion whom they recognized . They themselves knew nothing about what was happening . The guide led them half a mile in half an hour . There he stopped , and pointed to a grassy place under some trees at the roadedge . This was where they were supposed to wait . They were supposed to drop their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He turned on his heel and left , going toward the front . " But hey ! " Stein protested after him .

" All I know I was suppose to bring you here and tell you what I tole you . " " But wo n't they send another runner for us ? " " I reckon they will . i do nt know . All I know is what I told you . You 'll excuse me , sir , but I got to get back up there . " He turned and went on , disappeared around a bend in the road . It was as though C-for- ( ; hadic Company suddenly had dropped completely out of the world . Witt- the disappearance of the guide they did not see another living soul . There had been companies marching both in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The one in front had gone on , the one behind evidently some other way . There had been jeeps loaded with supplies bucking through the mud . There was now nothing , not a vehicle . The road stretched before them totally deserted . And nothing came along it either . Even  | sound seemed to have ceased . Except for the normal jungle noises , they seemed to have dropped into a vacuum ; and the only sound they could hear , one which their ears gradually became aware of , was the distant splashing and faint voices of men moving something up or down the river somewhere off behind the screen of jungle . They unslung their packs and dismantled them , then settled down to wait . They waited another hour and a half  --  from nine to tenthirty  --  before they saw another human , listening to the splashing and faint shouts from the river , staring at their neat , stacked rolls . There was not much discussion of the situation while they waited , largely because nobody knew what it was . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and preferred not to think about it . What little discussion there was employed a new word ; simply , " Elephant . " During the past two days whenever the group of treeless hills C-forCharlie 's regiment had been assigned to attack was mentioned , it was called The Elephant , or simply Elephant . Everyone was quick to pick the word up and use it , but nobody knew where it came from or what it meant . In actual fact , the complex of hills had been named ? Ile Dancing Elephant " by a young staff officer while studying an aerial photograph . Outlined on all sides by dark jungled valleys , the group of grassy hills did somewhat resemble an elephant standing on its hind legs with its forelegs up and its trunk above its head . The hind legs up to the belly were already held by the Marines , and the regiment 's attack ( less the 3d Battalion , which had been given another objective ) was to commence there and work its way up and across the rest of the group of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been felt out by reconnaissance and were known to hold at least two strong points in the Dancing Elephant from which it was believed they would contest vigorously any attack . One of these was a high , steep ridge running across the Elephant 's body at about the shoulder ; the other was the Elephant 's Head itself , the highest point in the entire hill mass . From it the Elephant 's Trunk tapered down to the low jungled country , affording the Japanese a good supply route  --  and a good escape route , if they needed it . It was the high ridge at the Elephant 's Shoulder , which had been labeled Hill 209 , that the 2d Battalion was supposed to be attacking today .  | But sitting on their suddenly deserted road , C-for-Charlie had no idea if they were doing it or not , and if they were , how they were faring , and  --  except for the officers and platoon sergeants  --  did not even know the hill 's designated number . Nor did many of them very much care . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had had enough infantry strategy and tactics to be interested generally . Besides , if his life was going to be in jeopardy because of this action , he wanted to know as much about it as he could . Anyway , sitting on this weirdly deserted road was singularly unnerving , and Bell wanted something to do . Discussing the action was as good as anything else . Bell was in the second squad of the second platoon , which was the squad of young Sergeant McCron , the notorious motherhen . McCron was great when it came to looking after his draftee charges , but he knew next to nothing about tactics , and cared even less . Bell approached his platoon sergeant , Keck . Keck was an old Regular who had been sergeant of this same platoon since 1940 . Bell learned nothing from him . Keck merely sneered at him irritably and told him that 2d Battalion was attacking a hill called 209 today at some place called The Elephant ( Christ knew why ) , that beyond it was another hill called ( appropriately enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack tomorrow provided 2d Battalion did not bog down today and , since they were in reserve today , what the hell difference did it make ? All of this Bell already knew . Keck was one of those toughened field noncoms who preferred to leave the maps and planning to the officers until he himself could get on the ground and see just what little jobs his platoon would have to do . Bell appreciated this , but it did n't help him any . His own platoon officer Lieutenant Blare was sitting close by but Blare had always been distant to Bell . Undoubtedly this was because of Bell 's former status and Bell did not feel like asking Blare . Then he saw Culp of the weapons platoon sitting on a hummock further on . Culp the typical uncomplicated happy-golucky college football player had always been kind to him . Bell decided to ask him . Culp appeared to be a little unnerved himself by the strangely  | deserted road and the waiting , because he seemed glad to talk . He was able to tell Bell that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lt Colonel out of his feat ) had conceived the poetic name of The Dancing Elephant , and with a stick drew him a rough map on the damp ground showing The Elephant 's salient features . When they had exhausted the topic  --  exhausted it to the point of mutual embarrassment , in fact  --  Bell went back to his squad , thinking it over . He decided there would be at least two rather nasty jobs of work in securing The Elephant . He had consumed twenty minutes . He sat down with his squad , thinking about his wife Marty and wondering what she was doing right now . It would be night now back in Columbus . Would n't it ? Suddenly a physical desire for her , a desire to take her and undress her and spread her out and look at her and mount her , so strong that it made his head begin to burn with a hot fever of flushed blood , passed over him and gripped him . It was so impossibly painful that he thought he must scream . Almost delirious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it go away . Immediately afterward he had a severe chill . Bell was not so delirious that he did not know what that meant . He made the tenth man in three days . Malaria was not considered a hospitalizing ailment except in the most extreme cases , and Bell was not the only man present with beginning malaria when finally a solitary figure appeared around the bend of the still-deserted road in front of them . At the spot where they sat the road bore a slight upgrade to the bend ahead . At the bend it turned sharply downhill to the right . The figure trudged uphill around the bend breathing heavily , stopped momentarily on the level ground to breathe , then stopped a second time when he saw them . After a couple of deep gasps for air , the man came on at a quickened pace , already shouting . " Where the fuck have you guys been ? I been lookin all over hell 's half acre for this outfit ! What the hell have you been doin ? You 're supposed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What the fuck happened ? " He continued to come on , shouting other plaintive statements . " All right , " Bugger Stein called disgustedly to his company . " Fall in , men , fall in. "  | The new guide did not cease his nervous exhortation even when he came up to them and , once they had fallen in , began to lead them onward . " Honestly , sir , I been lookin all over . You 're suppose to be clear over on the other side the river . That 's where they tole me you 'd be . " " We were just exactly where the other guide left us , and told us to stay , " Stein said . All his many pieces of equipment , dangling from their various straps , suddenly did not seem to be able to be kept in time and kept knocking against each other and against himself as he walked , ruining his balance . " Then he must of made some kind of a mistake , " the new guide said . " He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said ; " and quite definite . " " Then somebody up there gave him the wrong orders . Or else they told me wrong . " The guide thought . " But I know I 'm right . Because the rest of the battalion 's all over there . " Not a very auspicious beginning . But Stein was even more concerned with some other things . He waited a full fifteen seconds before he spoke . " What 's it like up there ? " He could not fully disguise in his voice the guilt he felt for asking . But the guide did n't notice . " It 's a ? " he searched for a word ? " a crazyhouse . " Stein had to be content with that . The guide did n't elaborate . George Band was marching just alongside Stein , and they exchanged a glance . Then , suddenly , Band grinned at him a wolfish grin . Wondering what the hell that meant , Stein put his mind on the job at , hand , because they had reached the bend . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unnamed river , and the slope was steep . The road itself , churned by traffic , was a mudslide , a gloomy descending tunnel between impenetrable jungle walls . The only way to take it was to turn sideways like a man running clown steep steps , and then dig in with the sides of the feet . At least half of the company took wet pratfalls going down , but there was very little laughter . What laughter  | there was was highpitched and nervous , and did not sound truly sincere . The pontoon bridge , wide enough and with wood tracks for the jeeps to cross , was directly at the bottom . Groups of traffic control men and bridge tenders watched them from both ends of it with curious but sympathetic eyes . After their scrambling , sliding , falling trek down , jerky , too fast and out of time like an early Chaplin movie , their momentum carried them right on across . In crossing , they saw for the first time the cause of the splashing and faint shouting they had heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the river pushing boats ahead of them , one line coming upstream another going down , an improvised supply line replacing the stalled trucks . The boats coming upstream carried supplies . And in the ones going down C-forCharlie got its first look at infantry wounded by infantry : dulleyed men most of them , lolling against the thwarts and wrapped here and there with the startlingly clean white of bandages , through which on many the even more startling reel of fresh blood had soaked . From the bridge every eye in C-for-Charlie turned toward them whitely , as the company crossed . Not all of the returning boats carried wounded men , only about half . As soon as they reached the other side they began to climb as steeply as they had come down , but the climb was longer . Many more men could be seen now everywhere , running back and forth and up and down and talking . To C-for-Charlie after an hour and a half alone the sight was comforting . They saw D-for-Dog , their battalion 's heavy weapons company , sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big mortars and .50 cal machineguns . There were some waves and greetings . Able and Baker had already gone up , they were told . Then they came out of the jungle onto the grassy slopes . As if there were a manmade demarkation line , the mud ceased suddenly and became hard , packed dirt which dusted their faces . They climbed on . It was here the S/Sgt Stack , platoon sergeant of the third lead platoon for an even longer time than Keck had been sergeant of the second , a lean hardfaced tough old drillmaster and disciplinarian , was found sitting by the trail with his legs pressed tightly together  | and his rifle in his lap , crying in agony at them as they passed : " Do nt go up there ! you 'll be killed ! do nt go up there ! you 'll be killed ! " The entire company had to pass him , one at a time and man by man in single file as if passing in some macabre review , as he sat pressing his legs and shouting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in the intensity of their own excitement , and they left him there . It was as close to the front as Stack ever got , and they did not sec him again . They were about two-thirds up . Nothing they heard or saw on the way up prepared them for the pandemonium they entered when they came over the crest . Climbing with the wind behind them they had heard no battle noises ; then , rounding the last bend and coming out onto the open hilltop suddenly , they found themselves immersed in infernal noise and tumult . Like a river running into a swamp and dissipating its current , the line of files trudged over the crest and disappeared in a mob of running or standing , shouting and talking men who struggled to make themselves heard above the din . Invisible but not far off , 8imm mortars fired off rounds with their peculiar gonglike sound . From further off came the monumental crashes of artillery firing sporadic salvos . Further off still .50 cal machineguns , chattering in bass voices , punctuated the intervals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolling unjungled terrain in front , there were the sounds of smallarms fire and grenades , and the explosions of the mortar shells and artillery rounds landing . All of this , compounded by the excitement , shouting and rushing about , created a demented riotous uproar whose total effect could only be mad confusion . C-forCharlie had arrived on the field , at just a few minutes after eleven . They were on a high knoll overlooking a series of grassy hills and draws rising out , of the surrounding sea of jungle . To their front the slope fell to a smaller knoll upon which the jungle encroached more closely , forming in effect a narrow neck of untreed land leading to the wider areas beyond . On this knoll , too , stood or ran groups of Americans in their green combat fatigues , a lesser number than up here , thirty perhaps . Beyond the second knoll the slope dropped again , not so steeply but much further ,  | to a broken ravine covered with sparse grass ; and beyond this low point the land rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which dominated the area and made invisible anything beyond it . On this slope , perhaps a thousand yards away and higher even than the original vantage point , infantrymen were fighting . To a few men like Bell who were informed about The Dancing Elephant 's terrain , it was clear that the knoll they occupied was The Elephant 's hind foot . The lower knoll in front , which was obviously 2d Battalion 's command post , thus became The Elephant 's knee leading to the wider areas ahead which formed the torso . And the high ridge where the infantrymen now fought was the Elephant 's Shoulder , the strong point labeled Hill 209 . A fire fight was obviously in progress . Several groups of squad or platoon size , tiny at this distance but plainly visible , were trying to get close to the crest and take it . The Americans , too far down the slope to lob grenades up to the crest , had to content themselves with riflefrre. ' lie Japanese , also clearly visible from time to time among the trees which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were under no such handicap ; they could simply drop them down , and the black explosions from the Japanese grenades kept bursting out here and there , front the hillside . One American , receiving such a grenade near him , was seen to turn and simply jump out from the side of the hill like a man jumping off a ladder . He hit and rolled , the grenade exploded black behind him , and after a moment he rose and began to work his way back up to his group . C-for-Charlie had arrived just at the climax . As they stood in the milling mob on the knoll trying to see and taking all of this in for the first time , the several groups on the slope rose into a concerted line and rushed the crest , lobbing grenades ahead of them and firing . They got to within perhaps fifteen yards of the top before they were repulsed . The machinegun fire , clearly heard on the knoll , was too much for them . They broke and began leaping and scrambling back down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left a number of their men , perhaps ten percent , behind them on the uphill slope . There were exclama-  | tions of dismay and a number of angry groans on the hilltop around C-for-Charlie . The chorus of groans was not the only action on the knoll as a result of the repulse . Runners and junior staff officers began to push their way out through the crowd and go various places . The center of all this activity was a small group of seven men standing together in grand isolation on the knoll 's peak . They were almost the only men present wearing any insignia , and all of them wore stars or eagles on the collars of their green fatigues . They were further distinguished from the others by their cleanliness . All of them were older men . From time to time they looked through binoculars or pointed at the terrain , talked to each other or into one of three telephones which they held . Occasionally one would also talk into a wireless radio packed on a much younger man 's back . C-for-Charlie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their regimental commander and , from their photographs , their division and corps commanders . One of these men now yelled irately into one of the sound power phones . Below on the second knoll the 2d Battalion 's Colonel shouted back at him into its mate . The one above , tall and spare , listened intently , nodding his helmeted head . Then he turned to the wireless radio , looking angry and unsatisfied . Completing his call , he began to speak apologetically to three of the others who wore stars . He wore eagles . Below , the 2d Battalion 's Colonel was now speaking into still another phone in his other hand . Across the valley eight hundred yards in front of him the company CP of the repulsed platoons was located behind the crest of a subsidiary ridge growing out of the side oI ' the main ridge . Off to one side of this small group two smaller clusters of men went through motions which could only mean that they were the company 's mortar section plying the tubes of their Gomm mortars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure detached itself from the CP group and dropped over the crest and went forward in rushes toward the groups which had been repulsed and which now were sporadically firing uphill at the Japanese . Before he reached them , he tumbled , shot . Immediately another dropped over the crest in his place . The moment this one reached them the  | groups began to withdraw along the ridge , again in rushes , firing in groups to cover each other , all the way back to the command post , where they lost no time in diving back over the crest of the subsidiary ridge . In the high-ranking group of older men on the hill , one was now waving his arms angrily and pounding himself furiously on the leg . Below , the 2d Battalion 's Colonel was doing the same thing . Seconds later artillery shells began to fall in great mushrooming clusters on the Japanese-held ridge . Whatever other manifestations occurred on the hilltop in connection with this operation , C-for-Charlie did not see them . They now were too involved in themselves and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the internationally famous command group . During the action Bugger Stein had gone over to report to his battalion commander , who was more a student observer there than an integral part of the group . Stein now returned to them . 1st Battalion less I ) - for- Dog was ordered as regimental reserve to occupy and hold the main ridge behind and to the left of the F-for-Fox CP which they had just been watching . The main ridge here , lower than 1 1 1 1 1 20O on the right , had been labeled Hill 208 and formed , so to speak , The Elephant 's middle and lower spine . The Japanese had never occupied it , but there was fear of a flanking counterattack . A-for-Able and C-for-Charlie were to man the line with B-for-Baker in reserve in the ravine , Colonel Tall 's orders . Since Able and Baker were already moving down right now , this meant that C-for-Charlie would have to pass through Baker  --  always a difficult maneuver , and they should watch it . There was a crinkly look of painful preoccupation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His own dispositions were : 1st and 2d platoons on the line , 3d in reserve ; Culp would set up his two MGs at optional points of choice along the line , the mortars to be set up near the company CP . Order of march would be 1st Platoon , 2d Platoon , Company HQ , Weapons Platoon , 3d Platoon . They were to move out right away . In the fact , as they formed up by platoons , it was discovered that they could not move right away . Their front was being crossed by E-for-Easy , the 2d Battalion reserve . Easy was being committed to the right wing of 2d Battalion 's attack where G-for-  | George , invisible from here around the corner of jungle , had also bogged down . C-for-Charlie knew many Easy Company people , and some of them called greetings . But Easy Company , going to certain attack instead of to a safe defensive position , preferred to ignore them and stared at them with a mixture of nervousness and hateful envy . Slowly they plodded across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woods . It took them fifteen minutes to cross . Then C-for-Charlie began to move down the slope , 1st Platoon in the lead . It was ( luring this fifteen minute wait that First Sergeant Welsh suddenly came to the fore . Up to now Welsh had been very carefully taking a back seat . He had no intention of becoming conspicuous or committing himself until he knew where he stood . He had tried to prepare himself , and two of the three canteens on his belt were filled with gin . In addition , he had his Listerine bottle . He could not say exactly what the experiences of today made him feel . All Welsh knew was that he was scared shitless , and at the same time was afflicted with a choking gorge of anger that any social coercion existed in the world which could force him to be here . In addition the tremendously intense excitement on the hilltop affected him powerfully . It was not unlike the feeling in a stadium generated by a crowd rooting at an important college football game . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do what he did . Standing with Stein and the Company HQ while E-for-Easy jogged past their front , Welsh spied a whole stack of unopened handgrenade cases on the edge of the hill , and simultaneously realized somebody had fucked up somewhere along the line in not issuing grenades to C-for-Charlie . GI inning his sly , mad grin , he decided to issue them himself . But in such a way that the cheeringsection emotional tenor of the ( lay should be properly honored . Without so much as a word to anyone , he suddenly crouched with his palms on his knees and at the top of his command voice bellowed : " Hup ! Twenty-six , thirty-two , forty-three ; ! tike ! " , whirled like a halfback , and ran over to the stack of cases drawing his bayonet and began splitting the soft pine cases open through the middle . The grenades inside were in black cardboard cylinders , their halves held together  | with yellow tape . Welsh began to draw them out and to bellow . " Eggs ! Fresh eggs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The enormous , booming command voice was easily heard despite the racket and tumult . The men of his company began to turn and look . Then hands began to shoot up out of the crowd . And Welsh , still bellowing , and still grinning crazily , began to forward pass the canned grenades into the crowd . " Eggs ! Eggs ! Footballs ! Footballs ! Sammy Baugh ! Sid Luckman ! Rah rah rah ! Who wants footballs ! Bronco Nagurski ! " His bellow rang magnificently over the entire hilltop . While men everywhere turned and stared as if he were insane , Welsh bellowed on and continued to forward pass grenades to his company , a perfect caricature of the classic football passer 's stance : left arm out , right arm cocked , right leg bent , left leg forward . In the grandly isolated command group one of the seven older men heard him . He turned to look , then slowly grinned his approval . With his elbow he punched a companion to look , too . Soon the entire group were watching Welsh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldier these generals liked to see . And across fifteen yards of hilltop crammed with American soldiers and materiel Welsh grinned back at them murderously , his insolent eyes crinkled slyly , and continued to bellow and to throw . Perhaps only one man really understood it , if anyone did , and this was Storm . An ironic grin began to spread across Storm 's cynical , broken-nosed face and drawing his own bayonet he ran over and began hacking open the cases and feeding Welsh the cylinders . " Sammy Baugh ! Sid Luckman ! Jack Manders ! Sammy Baugh ! " they bellowed in unison . " Rah rah rah ! " They went through the entire stack of cases in very little time . By this time E-for-Easy had passed . Taking the last two each for themselves , and laughing idiotically in a moment of rare understanding , they rejoined the Company HQ . With the men stripping off the yellow tapes and opening the cylinders , spreading the cotter pins and buttoning the pull rings down under their pocket flaps as they 'd seen the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If Bugger Stein had hoped for an orderly advance by elements ,  | he was out of luck . 1st Platoon led off , and did it properly : scouts out , double line of skirmishers . But before they had gone ten yards , all order vanished . It was impossible to keep any sort of formation on this slope which was so crowded with men . Some were simply watchers , standing and looking . Others in straggly lines sweated and panted horribly in the heat , carrying supplies forward . A number of walking wounded were given a wide berth by everyone ; and there were three groups sweating impossibly in the tropic sun to carry back seriously wounded who groaned or whimpered every time their stretchers were jerked or raised or lowered . By the time they reached the 2d Battalion CP on the knoll they had become a resolute gang . What little semblance of order remained was lost passing through the CP personnel . Beyond the command post it was less crowded , but the damage JI , was already done . They were too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of formation without making a long stop . Stein could only curse with frustration and try to keep the sweat off his glasses . He was painfully aware of all the brass that was watching him today . His only consolation was that Able and Baker ahead of him and now crossing the brushy bottom , were in no better shape . Around him his own men moved forward steadily with set , curiously covert faces in which the eyes seemed to be trying to betray no expression which might ever be used against them . The men in front , without having to be yelled at by Stein , veered left after Able and Baker according to instructions . Stein was glad of that . One of these men in front was Pfc Doll , who was from the 2d Squad ol ? the 1st Platoon . Doll did n't know how he happened to be in front and it made hint feel nervous and peculiarly exposed , but at the same time he was proud of his position and jealous of it . Whenever someone behind seemed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment so as to stay the same distance in front . It was he who , remembering Stein 's instructions , began the veering movement after Able and Baker , both of whom had now disappeared in the bottoms . Doll was carrying every bit of armament he had been able to get his hands on . His stolen pistol dangled on his hip fully loaded , cocked and on safety , and on his belt hung two knives now instead of one : his old one  | from home and the new bowie-type knife he had made from the Jap bayonet . Two grenades hung from his pocket flaps and two more reposed in his side pockets . He had not been able to get in on the Thompsonguns , like Charlie Dale , but he still had hopes of being able to get one later on , perhaps from a casualty . He walked steadily ahead with his stomach tingling very unpleasantly , almost sickly , glancing to left and right to make sure no one behind caught up to him . They were receiving very little fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground in amongst them and bury itself or go shrieking off without touching anyone . Nobody could tell whether they were spent ricochets from Hill 209 or deliberately aimed fire . These hurt nobody , but the men blinked and jerked away from them . Every now and then a man would go to ground when one struck near him and commence to crawl until embarrassed by the fact that the others were still up walking . As they advanced down into the dry , treeless ravine they were able to see around the angle of The Elephant 's belly . Here G-forGeorge was having another go at the right side of 11111 zoq . Like Fox on the left they had set up a Cl ' and base of lire on a lower subsidiary ridge and were now plugging away at the main crest with their mortars and machineguns , while receiving heavy mortar fire from the hill in return . Under cover of their fire two platoons of George were creeping close to the crest past the huddled bodies of their former attempts . C-for-Charlie slowed down to watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their tiny black bayonets visible on their rifles against the dun hillside , and rushed the crest . This time they went almost all the way . And a few of the men in front , perhaps a half dozen , actually got in among the Japanese who rose to meet them bayonet to bayonet . Here on the right side of the long ridge , where the reverse slope was not jungled and there were no trees along the crest , their struggle was clearly visible . Once again the heavy fire of the powerfully placed Japanese machineguns was too much . The two platoons broke and fled . Left alone , the little group engaged hand to hand attempted to break off their engagement and escape also , leaping and jumping and tumbling head over heels down the slope after their mates . Two  | however did not succeed . They were seen to be dragged alive and still struggling back over the crest by the Japanese . Below in the dry narrow valley C-for-Charlie stood watching this action open-mouthed . I'fc Doll , for one , felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With a raw honesty that was almost insupportable Doll wondered to himself how men could bring themselves to do such things , and what must it feel like when they did . To find yourself face to face with a screaming Jap bent on killing you and engage with him with naked bayonets . That was George Company up there . Doll knew a great many of them . He had a number of good friends in George Company . He had got drunk with them . But to find yourself being dragged back over the crest into the midst of those jabbering , Emperor-worshiping savages . Purtively his right hand sought his pistol . He meant to keep one round in at all times for his own head . But those guys there , they would n't have had time to use a pistol if they had it . If he was using his rifle or bayonet , how could he keep his pistol ready in his hand . He could n't . Doll decided he would have to give this problem more thought , serious thought . Above on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ground and were hugging the earth under the mortar and MG fire being thrown at them . Behind them C-for-Charlie heard a shout . Turning to look , they saw a man standing on the 2d Battalion knoll waving his arms at them . At first they simply stared . The man continued to shout and wave his arms . Slowly they came out of their trance . Bugger Stein who had been as guilty as the rest suddenly cleared his throat and said , " All right , men , let 's move out . " Glancing stealthily at each other , because no one wanted to betray what he was feeling , they began to move again and Doll , still in the lead , jumped to move out in a sudden fear that somebody might pass him . Sighing loudly , the artillery shells were still arching overhead to crash against the ridge . 155 and lot'j shells were bursting on the crest and on both sides of it with an almost continuous roar . Underneath them C-for-Charlie walked on nervously . There seemed to be so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | One of the most nervous was young Corporal Fife . Fife had gotten away late because Stein had sent him to Battalion HQ with a message about the spot Bugger had chosen for his CP . Except for the two Signal Corps men stringing the wire for the company 's sound power phone some distance behind him , Fife was the last man in the crowd . Because he was moving so slowly he remained the last man . Ahead of him he could see Storm marching along with his big jaw set , carrying his Thompsongun in one hand with his rifle slung from his shoulder and surrounded by Dale with his Thompson and the other cooks . Not far from them walked Welsh , Stein and Band and the two clerks Bead and Weld . Fife wanted to catch up to them , but he found it hard to move any faster when he was looking this way and that all the time to see if there was something or someone about to shoot at him . When Fife had come over the lip of the hill down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of exposure . Only once before in his life had he had a similar sense of such total exposure and that was one time on a patrol on maneuvers when he stood on a mountaintop and looked down to see how far he could fall if he should lean over too far . But today the feeling of exposure was accompanied by another of total isolation and helplessness . There were too many things to watch out for . One man simply could not take care of them all to protect himself . It was about as easy to get killed by accident as by enemy deliberation . Trying to look everywhere at once , he stumbled ahead tripping now and then on the tough grass stems or on rocks . When first one bullet and then moments later a second kicked up puffs of dust in front of him , he went to ground and began to crawl , convinced some Japanese sniper had signaled him out to shoot at . The crawling was hard work . The kneehigh grass made it hard for him to see where he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glasses . He had to stop repeatedly to wipe them . Finally he tied his grimy handkerchief across his forehead . This helped a little . But there was something else bothering him : his grenades . Fife had caught two of the handgrenades Welsh had passed into the crowd and had spread the pins and buttoned them under his pocket flaps . Now as he crawled they bounced and bumped along the ground , catching on grass stems .  | Terrified by the aspect of one of them pulling off and igniting its three-second fuse underneath him , ashamed of himself for what he considered his cheap cowardice , but not so ashamed that shame could wash away the imagined picture , Fife unbuttoned his pocket flaps from over them and rolled them away from him , left them and crawled on . But when he raised up his head to look around he could see that the company , all of whom appeared to be standing up walking , was alarmingly far ahead of him , and gaining . It was then that Fife had had to make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and being shot at by some invisible party , he was more terrified of being accused for his cowardice . His back muscles crawling , he stood up and took one tentative step , then another . Nothing happened . He began to jog toward his company trotting bent over at the waist and carrying his rifle at high port . When another bullet kicked up dirt in front of him and went screaming off , he shut his eyes , then opened them and trotted on . It was just then that the entire company had stopped to witness George Co 's attempt on the crest , and Fife was able to catch up to them . He too saw the attack . He stood with the others , wide-eyed , slack-mouthed , disbelieving , until the arm-waving shouter on the knoll reminded them that they were not here simply as spectators . Then he picked himself a spot in amongst the Company HQ and stayed with them , comforted unreasonably to be in a crowd . The brushy bottom of the ravine was just in front of them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to climb , they were not far from the protection of the subsidiary ridge which held Fox 's command post . In a very few minutes they would pass into complete cover behind it , out of view of Hill 209 entirely . And it was just here that the first man in the company was wounded . Whether deliberately or by accident no one could tell , because no one could tell whether the desultory fire they were getting was aimed or was simply stray bullets from the ridge . The man 's name was Peale and he was an older man , perhaps thirty-five , one of the draftees . He was moving in the middle of the crowd , not far from John Bell and not far from Fife and the Company HQ either , when he suddenly clapped his hand to his thigh  | and stopped , then sat down holding his leg , his lips trembling , his face white . Bell ran over to him pulling at his first aid pack . " Are you all right , Peale ? " " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wounded . I 'm hit in the leg . " But before Bell could get his first aid packet out one of the company 's medics was there with a gauze compress and looking very serious at this first opportunity of exercising his trade in combat . While Bell and Peale watched he tore open the pantsleg and inspected the wound which was bleeding only superficially . A little rill of dark blood ran down the white leg . Peale and Bell stared at it . The medic salted the compress with sulfa powder and wrapped it onto the wound with a roll of gauze . The bullet had gone in but had not come out . Peale had begun to grin stiffly . His face still white , his lips still trembling , his mouth was nevertheless stretched into a stiff but happily cynical grin . " Can you walk ? " the medic asked him . " I do nt think so , " Peale said . " I think my leg hurts pretty bad . You better help me . I think it 's goin to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , come on . I 'll take you back , " the medic said and grunting , hoisted him up onto his one good leg . Behind them , coming up with the Company HQ , Bugger Stein was already calling to the men who had stopped to move on , keep going , do n't stop . First one then another they began to turn away back to the climb . " So long , Peale . " " Take it easy , Peale . " " Good luck , Peale . " " So long , you guys , " Peale called after them , his voice rising as they moved . Do nt worry about me . It 'll be a long time before I can walk good . No doctor 's goin to tell me I can walk on this leg . Good luck , you guys ! " All of them had passed him now moving up the slope and he suddenly stopped calling as though he knew it was futile and stood looking after them , his grin fading . Then with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to descend . Fife , who was one of the very last to pass him , heard what he said as he turned away . " I got me a Purple Heart , " Peale said to the medic , " and I been in combat . I never even seen a Jap ; but I do nt care . No doctor 's gon na tell me I can walk on this leg for a long time . Come on , let 's get out of this . Before I get hit again and get killed . That 'd be hell , would n't it ? " Fife , too dumbfounded by the events of the day and still in a state of shock , did not know what to think of this and , in fact , did not think anything . His ear simply recorded it . A little further in front John Bell , as he climbed on , knew only that he had about Peale a curious double feeling of grinding envy and at the same time a great relief that it was not himself who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made good his promise about the doctors or not no one ever found out , but C-for-Charlie did not see him again . They had now passed behind the subsidiary ridge . The sense of relief it gave them was enormous , unbelievable . From the look on their faces they might have just been removed clean away , all the way back to the real safety of Australia . In front of them B-forBaker in battalion reserve , and equally relieved , had spread out over the only level space available on the slope and were already digging their slit trenches for the night . C-for-Charlie passed through them with an exchange of greetings that was near-hysterical in its happy relief to be out of the line of fire . Behind them and out of sight now on Hill 209 , though not out of hearing , the fight went on . The spot Bugger had picked for his CP was a tiny spur a hundred yards below the crest . I lore the Company IIQ and the mortar squads dropped off , Culp going on up with the rifle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him to come back and place the mortars , Maui and ' Fills , who were members of the same mortar squad , engaged iii a discussion with Fife and Bead about the day 's events and the walk the company had made under their first fire . The overly gay mood of relief and safety still prevailed in everybody . But underneath it lurked the unspoken awareness that today had not been tough at all , that this protection was only temporary ,  | that eventually the good luck would run out and people would die . It was visible in the dark depths of everyone 's eyes . " This Tills , " Mazzi sneered squatting by the 6omm baseplate that he carried . " He spent more time on his belly on the fuckin ground than he did up on his feet . I do nt see how he managed to keep up with the rest of us . " Tills , looking sheepish , did not answer . " Ai nt that right , Tills , " Mazzi said . " Did n't you ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did you ? " Tills said . " Did you see me ? " " No , I never , " Tills admitted lamely . " You fucking A you never , Tills . What was the use , I say ? Anybody could tell that fire was n't aimed fire . It was stray stuff from the ridge . So it could hit you just as well layin down as standin up . Maybe better . " " And I guess you was n't never scared even once ? " Tills said angrily . Mazzi merely grinned at him without answering , his face crinkled up around his eyes , his head on one side . " Well , I was , " Fife said clearly . " I was scared shitless . All the time . From the minute I stepped onto the slope till I got here . I was crawlin around on my belly like a snake . I never been so scared in my life . " But it did not help him to tell it . He found that no matter how he overstated it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It became only funny , when you said it . It was n't the same thing at all . " So was I , " little Bead put in in his child 's voice . " Scared to death . " Bugger Stein happened to be standing not far away , with Lt Band and one of the platoon lieutenants who had come down from the ridge to ask something , and Fife saw him stop what he was saying and look over straight at him , Fife , with a surprised look of reluctant approval . It was as though Bugger would have liked to have said the same thing himself but could n't , and at the same time had not expected anything so honest to come from Fife . For a moment Fife felt a fleeting resentment . Then taking Bugger 's look of approval as his cue , he began to elaborate his adventure of the walk under fire . He had not meant to tell anyone about the grenades , but  | now he did , making himself the buffoon . Before very long he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers and Mazzi the New York hep guy . He was the honest coward . ' If you wanted to make people like you , play the buffoon whom they could laugh at without having to admit anything about themselves . It still did not make him feel any better : did not alleviate his shame , did not cause to cease the misery of fear he felt right now . " As a matter of fact , " he said , utilizing even this point , " I 'm still scared shitless , right now . " As if to prove him right , there was an instant 's fluttering sound in the air , not unlike a man blowing through a keyhole , and three geysers of dirt spouted into the air thirty-five yards away , followed instantly by one loud clap of sound . There was an antlike scramble on the little spur as everyone tried to hit the dirt on the slope away from the surprise . Private Mazzi , if not the foremost , was certainly not the last among them , and Tills had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scared ? " he asked loudly , as they all began to get up with sheepish faces when no more shells arrived . Everyone was glad to laugh at Maui and turn the ridicule away from their own sheepishness . But Mazzi did not laugh . " And I guess you stood up there like a big fat fucking hero , fuckface , " he said and glowered sullenly at Tills . There was some muttering about short rounds , but it was soon stopped by Stein . Everybody knew that the Japanese had a habit of dropping their heavy mortar shells in , to upset the troops , whenever there was an American artillery barrage . However , the arrival of the mortar shells did put a stop to the discussions . Everyone decided at the same time to unship their entrenching tools and start digging their slit trenches , the heavy work of which they had been putting off . Bead and Weld were designated to dig the holes for Stein and Band , who decided it was time they inspected the ridge . Corporal Fife was put in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the honest coward ' , Fife had noted that Welsh was the only one who had not laughed . Instead the First Sergeant , who was standing with Storm ( who was roaring ) , only eyed him shrewdly with screwed-up knowing eyes . Now , when Fife had put his assistant clerks to work on the officers ' holes , he went  | over to Welsh and Storm who , after a prolonged discussion about night infiltrators , were preparing to dig their holes together at a certain spot . " Hey , First , is this where you guys 've decided to dig in ? " he said cheerfully . Welsh , in the act of detaching his shovel from his combat pack , did not look up or answer . " Because I thought I 'd dig in over here with you guys if it was , " Fife said . Welsh ignored him . " I mean , I guess it 's as good a place as any , " Fife said . " This is where you 're gon na dig , ai nt it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ okay ? " Fife said . He unslung his pack . Welsh stopped his unbuckling of straps and looked up at Fife with eyes of stone and a face as expressionless as unchiselled granite . " Take off , " he barked . " Get the fuck away from me . And stay away from me , kid . " Storm had stopped his work to watch . Fife was carried back a step by the sheer viciousness of the sergeant 's retort . " Well , tsh000 ! " He attempted a sarcasm which did not come off . " I certainly did n't mean to inflict my presence on anybody . " Welsh stared at him , silent , refusing to be drawn into any carping discussion . " Well , I guess I know when I 'm not wanted , " Fife said with a lame try at airiness . Visibly crestfallen , unable to hide it , he turned and moved off carrying his pack by its straps . " Why do n't you ever treat the kid decent once in a while ? " Storm said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't mean to wind up playin nursemaid and havin to mother some kid , that 's why . I got enough problems to occupy me . " Welsh straightened from his pack . " Here . You got some dirt . Take the shovel and gim me the mattock . " Storm did n't answer and exchanged the tools . Behind and above them Lt Culp was coming down the slope in the great leaping strides of a fullback on vacation . Hardly pausing at the CP he col-  | lected his mortar section and carried them on down to a nearly level spot almost a hundred yards below . From here they could lob shells over the crest onto the precipitous jungled slopes beyond . After setting up their mortars , they would dig in their own perimiter defense for the night . For quite a long while everyone was occupied with digging . Private Mazzi was still infuriated at Tills for having given him the finger when the mortar shells dropped in . It was an unfair advantage because everybody had chucked for cover . On the other hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one time . While he had seen Tills go down on at least three occasions . So Mazzi had every right to ridicule Tills . While Tills had no right to ridicule Mazzi . Him and Tills was supposed to be buddies , but Tills was always doing something like that . Mazzi had not picked Tills for a buddy . He did not like to be buddying with a cornball hick from Hicksville who was not hep . But in this mortar squad there had not been no choice . In this mortar squad Tills was only an ammunition carrier . Mazzi was designated as the second gunner and carried the baseplate . But he was really only an ammunition carrier , too , because Sergeant Wick and the first gunner , who carried the tube , did everything together and handled all the firing between them . Mazzi hardly got to touch the sights . And the other ammunition carrier Tind was only a punk kid draftee . So there was n't nothing left but Tills . Mazzi treated him kind and gave him lots of good advice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and did something else , and was always wrong . But he would n't never learn , and would n't never admit Mazzi was always right . ' I hat was what conk of trying to be buddies with a cornball hick from I In ksvillc . But this time ' fills had tore it . Mazzi made up his mind he was n't having no more to do with ' Fills . Fullback Culp had ordered them to dig two-man holes and double up , one awake and one sleeping , and ordinarily Maui would have dug with Tills . This time instead he asked Tind in a loud voice to dig with him , without saying a word to Tills , leaving Tills to dig alone . And after digging in , he got permission from The Fullback to go up to the crest for a while . All his good buddies who were hep , a whole gang of them from The  | Bronx and Brooklyn , Carni , Suss , Gluk , and Tassi , were all up there in the 1st Platoon . He could feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let him do his own damn fucking thinking . See how he liked it . The fact that he had been scared on the walk across did n't have nothing to do with it . He had n't hit the ground , had he ? Everybody was scared . As Mazzi climbed past the CP on his way up , a loud roar of laughter wafted down the steep fall to them from the crest . By standing up and leaning their heads far back the CP men could see the platoons on the ridge , seemingly almost straight above them , small but sharp in the sunlight . " What the hell 's going on ? " somebody yelled up . " Nellie Coombs 's got a hard on , " a voice yelled down . " Is that horny or not ? Waitin here to get his ass shot off . " " It 's a lie , " the man below yelled up . " Like hell it 's a lie ! " the voice above cried . " I just seen it . It 's no lie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nellie Coombs 's sexual propensities were almost legend , as well known as his improper practices at cards . Everyone knew them . And those were all Mazzi 's bunch of hep pals up there in the 1st Platoon . Mazzi would be interested to see how many of them had hit the dirt on the walk across . The line of slit trenches curved along the military crest of the ridge in a parallel line a few yards below the true crest . On the other side tall jungle trees strung with lianas towered above it . From up here , above the subsidiary ridge and only a few yards lower than the highest point on Hill tog , it was possible to view the entire bowl of the battle area . The officers had climbed up to inspect the company 's line before the work on the holes was done , and Captain Bugger Stein had stood for a long time looking down at this panorama of a military operation . Now , the work of digging done , the platoons could sit on the sides of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to , however , and soon a blackjack game which included Mazzi and his New York friends as players , was under way on the edge of Nellie Coombs 's hole . Cries of " Hit me ! " and " I 'll stay " competed with the battle noises from 2d Battalion .  | And John Bell though invited to play preferred to sit on the edge of his slit trench and look down into the basin . It was a formidable sight . Except for the slopes of Hill 209 still under Japanese fire , the entire area was aswarm with American troops carrying supplies and wounded . 2d Battalion still battered at the hill , trying to take it . When Bugger Stein had stood for so long looking down at it , the situation was static . But now , as the first afternoon shadows began to creep out from the deepest hollows down there , a new artillery barrage began to crash down onto the right side of the long ridge where George Co had attacked before . Minutes later a roaring came from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven P-38s carrying depthcharges appeared in the sky , then flashed by overhead . The planes made two preliminary passes for looking , then on the third pass dropped the big black drums which threw up oily gouts of flame as they burst along the ridge . Not one landed on the Japanese forward slope toward the Americans . Dipping their wings , the planes flew off . The infantry watched them wistfully . The artillery continued to gnaw at the ridge . The Japanese , without either planes or artillery to support them , were fighting back toughly . Bell , knocking the flat of his mattock against the edge of his dangling foot with rhythmic thoughtfulness as he sat and watched , could not help feeling , along with his fear of them , a little sorry for them . On the other hand it was a purely intellectual sorrow . They would not feel sorry for him , so to hell with them . Still , he was glad he was on his side instead of theirs . He was also glad he was here and not there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry for almost everyone . His wife Marty , for instance . In a way this war was tougher on her than it was on him . Bell knew how much a need she had of physical affection , its reassurance , its re-establishment of  --  of existence , of personality . In a way it was much harder for her to be back there where there were lights , nightclubs , booze , people than it was for him to be here where there was nothing to be tempted by . Much harder . But all of this was intellectual . Emotionally , Bell felt sorry most of all for himself . Something had happened to him today with the wounding of  | Peale . Perhaps it was the sheer accident of it . There was no earthly reason why that bullet should have struck Peale and not someone else . But whatever it was , when he saw that little hole in Peale 's leg with its trickle of blood running down the white thigh , the actuality of his own death , perhaps sometime soon , perhaps not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Bell understood the superstitious talisman he had made of never having anything to do with any other women after being called up ; he would not even have conversations with them for fear of feeling some desire . Now he added to that first superstition a second which was that if he and Marty both remained true to each other , he could make it back with his genitals intact . Continuing to tap his pick-mattock against his shoe , he continued to watch the basin , wondering if that first light shot of malaria he 'd had this morning would come back on him tonight . Everybody who had it said evening seemed to be the worst time for attacks . The planes had claimed everyone 's attention , even that of the blackjack players , and when the barrage lifted everybody who was up high enough was watching . From up here the distance to the right end of Hill 209 was greater and the tiny greenclad figures harder to see . They seemed to pass in and out of visibility as they moved up the slope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figures of Fox Company 's mortar section could be seen on the reverse slope of the subsidiary ridge , working their mortars like fury . And indeed , all across the basin , as the shadows in the hollows continued to creep outward , wherever there were weapons men served them furiously , putting down fire on the ridge . This time they went all the way . The tiny greenclad Americans met the tiny Japanese chest to chest on the crest , pushed them back and disappeared over the top . Others followed them . After a moment , when they did not reappear running backward , feeble cheers broke out faintly all across the basin on the rearward slopes , sounding more stimulated by a sense of duty than by any real happiness . Undoubtedly the others , like C-for-Charlie whose cheering was quite light , were thinking more about what might be in store for themselves tomorrow , than about what 2d Battalion had accomplished today .  | But the morrow was not to be so bad . 2d Battalion had been ordered to renew the assault at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Head and the regiment 's main objective . This good news reached them by evening together with the details of today 's fight . The regimental commander had dictated a bulletin which was copied down in longhand on the spot by clerks and sent forward to all companies . It said that American arms had triumphed . All of Hill 209 was now in American hands . Easy Company ( whom C-forCharlie had watched cross their front so woodenly and uncommunicatively ) had made a march of eleven hundred yards along the edge of the jungle while receiving fire from two directions , and with twenty-five casualties and the aid of G-for-George had completed the envelopment of the Japanese position . They had killed fifty Japanese , captured seventeen machineguns , eight heavy mortars , and a host of smaller arms . They took no prisoners ; the Japanese who had not escaped back to Hill 210 preferred to die . 2d Battalion 's losses had been 27 killed and 8o wounded , many of whom were picked up on the slopes after the battle . The majority of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared to have suffered from malnutrition . This was the official news , would be written into the Regimental Papers . C-for-Charlie could n't have cared less . They were glad 2d Battalion had won the hill , of course . But they were more glad to learn that 2d Battalion was continuing the attack . That the Japanese were hard up for food did not interest them at all . The casualty numbers interested them , though it seemed to them that after what they 'd witnessed the numbers were astonishingly light . There seemed some hope in that . If , of course , they were being told the truth . But the news that interested them most was unofficial . It was not contained in the regimental commander 's bulletin , but it was in the mouth of every messenger who carried the bulletin forward . This was the story of what happened to the two men from George Co whom they had watched the Japanese drag back over the crest in the earlier assault . Their bodies had been found on the reverse slope after the Japanese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and one of them had been beheaded alive with a sword . He was found by the advancing E-for-Easy with his hands  | tied behind his back and his head sitting on his chest . And as a gesture of defiance , or hatred , or something , the Japanese after beheading him had severed his genitals and stuffed them into the mouth of the severed head . That this occurred after death was clear from the lack of blood on the ground near the mutilated crotch . That he had been beheaded alive was equally clear from the amount of blood which had soaked into the earth near the severed neck . The sheer barbarity of the thing swept through C-for-Charlie like a cold water shock . A cold knifing terror in the belly was followed immediately by a rage of anger . These men they were fighting were veterans of Burma and China and Sumatra . That they professed to hate all white men was well known . That they had perpetrated this sort of outrage in China and the Philippines on their own darkskinned races was known too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of thing to civilized white American infantry , and specifically the ? Regiment of the ? Division , was almost too much to believe and certainly too much to be borne . There was a storm of promises never to take a by God prisoner . Many swore they would henceforth coolly and in cold blood shoot down every Japanese who came their way , and preferably in the guts . The official sources were trying to keep the thing hushed up . Perhaps they felt it might overly frighten the troops . More likely they felt that to let it out would be to allow the entrance of basic human problems into what official sources hoped to keep an essentially simple , uncomplicated military situation . That was what Bugger Stein felt , and he disagreed . Official sources always wanted a clean , clearcut , easily understood military campaign , easily explainable afterwards in terms of strategy and tactics which the generals of the world could write about cleanly , and this sort of thing was embarrassing to that concept . But in spite of official sources the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stein did not intend to be a party to the suppression of it . The troops should know what they were in for . Perhaps those two poor bastards had n't felt much . After all , with the adrenalin and rage and shock of fighting hand to hand , they were probably half crazed . That was all that Stein could see to hope for .  | When the messenger who brought the bulletin delivered his other , unofficial news at the CP on the spur , there was almost a riot of murderous reaction . Storm , Bead , Culp , Doll who had come down from 1st Platoon with a message , and Lt Band all made sanguinary promises . Storm looked particularly killerish . Only Welsh with his sly eyes said , and showed , nothing . Little Dale the second cook with his stooped shoulders and intense , tough , flat-eyed face was almost beside himself and swore to gutshoot every Jap who tried to come to him to surrender , after toying with him five minutes first . Young Corporal Fife 's reaction on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) was one of fear , disbelief and finally a massive horror ( as he enviously watched these others ) that any creatures who spoke a language , walked upright on two legs , dressed in clothes , built cities , and claimed to be human beings could actually treat each other with such fiendish animal cruelty . Obviously the only way really to survive in this world of humansocalledculture we had made and were so proud of , was to be more vicious , meaner and more cruel than those one met . And Fife , for the very first time in his life , was beginning to believe he did not have the toughness of character which this demanded . It was Pfc Doll who carried the news up the slope to the platoons on the line . John Bell , when Doll on his way back to the 1st Platoon stopped off to tell the 2d , was standing with his squad leader Mother McCron and Big Queen and another man named Cash . Queen , made sergeant after the defection of Stack , and Cash were both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two platoons , and Bell 's and Cash 's holes were the actual joining point . The two sergeants were just in the act of telling the two men to buddy up for the night , one sleeping and one awake , to facilitate liaison between the platoons , when Doll reached the crest , breathing heavily , with his news . Bell had never seen such reactions on men 's faces . Big Queen turned red as a beet with rage , and muttered something about cracking skulls , flexing his big fists . McCron 's eyes got vague and faraway and his face took on an unwilling , shamed look as if he did not want to hear as he muttered , " Oh , the dirty tuckers , " sadly . Cash , a tall powerfully built Ohio draftee who had been a cab driver in Toledo  | and was known in the company simply as " Big Un , " on the other hand grinned . He had a cold , gleefully tough face anyway , as hard and of the same texture as an uncracked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that , his blue eyes squinted , he looked positively and spinechillingly murderous . All he said was " Okay " in a very soft , breathed voice . He said it several times . Bell 's own reaction was one of sickness . He felt sick all over , physically sick . He said nothing . But he thought . He thought about the new talisman he had made just today , and he thought about his wife Marty . Ah , Marty . He hoped if anything every happened to him like that , that nobody would ever write or tell her how this cock and these balls of his which she had loved so had finally wound up . The evening itself that night , in cynical contrast to the news , was very lovely . Up here in the hills night did not fall so swiftly as it did down below in the groves . The twilight lingered on turning everything including the air itself to rose , seeming as though it were reluctant to leave and plunge them into the blackness of their first night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diabolically , it had given them a lovely striated tropic sunset to look at in the western sky . It was a time to think of peacefulness and women . Shortly before dark , when it came time to cat , it was found that there was no water . There was plenty of C ration around . But ration details coming down from the platoons on the crest wanted water much worse than food . The sun , the heat , the sweltering , and the sweating had been enormous and every canteen was empty . All of them had seen jeeploads of watercans on the way up from the river . But wherever these were , diverted into the back areas , or poured out on the ground , they were not at the front . Finally , after much haggling and arguing on the sound power phone and much sending back and forth of messengers , Stein was able to obtain enough water to allow each man half a canteen , which was to last him all through tomorrow . Supper was eaten dry and cold , choked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night it rained twice . No one slept much . Many useless grenades were thrown . And every now and then flaming bursts of riflefire lit the night , betraying positions , hitting nothing . And at dawn , bearded , mudstained , grimy and greasy , rising in  | their blue holes to watch 2d Battalion take off over the top of Hill 209 , the whole of C-for-Charlie looked as though they had been living here for months . In the chill mists of first light , from this far away , it was difficult to see them as one by one , crouching and carrying their rifles in both hands or one , they hopped over the last foot of ridge and disappeared . A sort of ragged cheer rose briefly and fell away . After that those who remained watched in silence . With The Elephant 's Shoulder and Hill 209 now secured , the line snaked along for a thousand yards and more , following the contours of the several ridges which formed the Dancing Elephant 's spine . As the attacking companies of 2d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened up between the two battalions , and twice during the morning C-for-Charlie was forced to move . Breakfast had been choked down dry , also . After that there was nothing to do but sit and wait . The moves , when the orders for them came , were not difficult to make . The left platoon simply pulled out , passing to the rear of the right one , and took up positions at the appointed spot . Then the former right platoon , now the left , joined them . To C-for-Charlie 's left Able Company was making the same maneuver and to the left of Able a battalion of the division 's reserve regiment was moving in . Even with the two moves , they had not moved far enough right to see into the battle area proper . They were now almost to the actual Elephant 's Shoulder , and they could now hear the mortar and machinegun fire . But just here , as though The Dancing Elephant to keep its balance had hunched its massive shoulders , the ridge curved inward forming an angle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now on the same slope where yesterday , while they watched , F-for-Fox had made its try for the crest and been repulsed ; and recognizing it with a sense of squeamishness , they settled down again to wait . They were not unaware that each time they were moved , it was closer to the fight , never farther away from it . During one of the moves Fullback Culp had seen something move in the brush below , or thought he had . At that moment they had been above and just in front of the side ridge which the F-for-Fox CP had occupied yesterday , and at the foot of its forward slope a  | small brushgrown draw fell steeply to the main ravine . Culp stopped and whistled softly and pointed . Far down below them in the basin , so recently secured from the enemy , lines and groups of men were moving everywhere with supplies , but up here on the forward slope of the subsidiary ridge there was no one . Nobody else could see anything moving in the brush , but a sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and irrespective of rank the seven men who carried the new Thompsonguns had begun to see themselves more and more as a sort of private club . Welsh , Storm , Dale , MacTae , the officers Stein and Band , all of them except Culp were part of the Company HQ anyway , and Culp as commander of the weapons platoon was almost always with the HQ . And it was now the club which took over the manhunt . Spacing themselves so nothing in the little draw could get past their combined fire , while the rest of the CP and the reserve platoon stopped to watch , they waited while two of them , Culp and MacTae , came down the draw like beaters . When they had come halfway and with everyone watching intently , still nothing had moved . " Watch out , " Culp called from above , grinning with all his teeth . " I 'm gon na give ' em a burst or two , if they 're in there . Hold on . " Turning the gun in its side in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bursts . When he released the trigger he looked surprised . " Damn things really do kick . More'n I thought . " Still nothing moved in the brush . " Come on , let 's look , " MacTae said . The two of them disappeared into the brush , which swayed above their heads as they moved . They came out looking sheepish . " Nothin , " Culp said . " But you never can tell . Might of been . You know , infiltrators . " He was quite right . There had been infiltration last night in 2d Battalion 's area . But there was a good deal of nervous laughter at his expense , anyway , as they all climbed back up to the platoons on the line . There had been some rather extreme nervous tension there for a moment , and now it relieved itself in laughter at Culp . None of them , they found to their surprise , were at ease in the use of their weapons . They had been trained too well and too long in the restrictive safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heads of friends .  | Shortly after noon they sustained a counterattack . After the firing all stopped , and they began to compare notes , it was discovered that not one of them could honestly say he had seen a Japanese during the firing . Later it was found that D Company on their right actually had repelled what was probably a patrol in force and had killed several . But when 1 ) had begun firing , the firing had spread all along the line until everybody , including the battalion from the reserve regiment on the far left , was heaving grenades and firing over the crest into the jungle whether they saw any Japanese or not . And even afterward when it was over , at least half of the firers still believed they had repelled a major Japanese attack . The others , who knew better , momentarily looked sheepish in the midst of their excitement , but were unable to refrain from rejoining the wild celebration . A few perhaps wondered what the Japanese patrol must have thought , to see a line a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they must have laughed heartily . Corporal Fife , curiously enough , was one of these cynics . With the rest of the Company HQ he had rushed to the line when the firing started . He had fired a whole clip of eight and reloaded , intending to fire more , before common sense attacked him in the form of a deep depression at the uselessness of it all . All around him men were hollering happily and throwing their grenades and firing . A few feet to his left Welsh , cursing joyously and grinning ecstatically , was spraying everything in sight with his Thompsongun . And in front of them the empty jungle underbrush swayed and rustled as though in a rainstorm and chunks of bark and wood popped from the trees . Nursing his depression and setting his safety , he crept back away from the line a few feet and sat down by himself , cradling his rifle between his knees and leaning on it . What the hell was the matter with him ? Even in a happy blowoff of useless firing he could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the awareness of all these new situations he was being thrown into , which he could neither evaluate nor understand . It was like being blind . It was during this ' counterattack ' that I'fc Doll threw his first live grenade , and it was a traumatic experience . Doll lost his nerve . At the point where Doll stood the ridge made a slight dip and there was a chest high clay bank ( whether manmade or not it was impossible  | to tell ) behind which one could stand as though in a trench , though the back of it was open to all the basin . The firing when it started was feeble and sporadic and spread slowly , but when it thickened and the dull booming of grenades began to be heard among the chattering of riflefire Doll who had already fired a clip pulled one of his four grenades from a side pocket and pulled its pin . He had spread the cotter pins so widely for reasons of safety that he had to bite its ends together before it would pull out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tooth . Perhaps that was what undid him . He remembered movies where men pulled the pins of grenades with their teeth , and realized with a shock of inadequacy that his teeth would never be able to stand it . In any case , he had waited too long . He now had the pin out and was standing looking at this heavy orange corregated castiron object in his hand . As long as he clenched it and kept the tin lever down it was not dangerous , but already his hand felt slippery . Even if he had not already dropped the pin on the ground , he knew it would be impossible to reinsert it , dangerous to attempt . He had activated it , and now here he was with it , and if he did not want to go on carrying it forever while his hand slowly weakened or cramped itself and relaxed , lie was going to have to throw it ; but what he really wanted to do was simply drop it on the ground and turn and flee . That of course was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it would certainly kill the men around him . Why oh why had he ever pulled the pin out ? Clenching his teeth until his jaws ached , spacing his feet with great care , oblivious to the noise and firing around him and staring with bulging eyes at the object in his hand as though it were a lighted bomb he was holding , which in fact it was , he threw it with all his strength into the jungle and ducked shaking behind the bank , the ' splatti ' of the igniting fuse as loud in his ears as an explosion . When he had first pulled it out of his pocket , he had meant to watch it light and explode . There was no thought of that now . He could no more have stayed up and watched it than he could have flown after it . He heard a low boom from across the bank , then immediately after it two others . He would never know which was his , and he did n't care . Shattered , he crouched quaking against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose and commenced firing  | his rifle angrily into the empty jungle , hoping nobody had seen him . He fired three clips one after the other , but he did not try to throw any more grenades . When the whole thing was over , he simply turned in his tracks and sat down with his knees drawn up and his back against the bank , breathing in a kind of convulsive groan and staring furiously at nothing . Somehow during the firing session a dead man had appeared behind C-for-Charlie . In the excitement he went unnoticed at first . Then everyone seemed to discover him all at once . Whole groups turned simultaneously to stare with startled faces . Nobody knew how he had got there or where he came from or who he was . He could not be from C-for-Charlie because nobody in Charlie had been hurt . He could not have been killed just now in the counterattack ' because he was obviously already stiff . He had just sort of appeared . Ten yards back from the crest down the slope which was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little clay ledge about two yards wide , he lay on his side in an almost foetal position , his knees drawn up against his chest , his half clenched hands up on either side of his face but not touching it . His helmet still on his head , his rifle belt still fastened around his green fatigue blouse , he appeared to be trying to hide from what had already overtaken him . Just below his little clay ledge the slope steepened sharply , and if he could only have rolled over once he could have slid all the way to the bottom of the basin . Many in C-for-Charlie wished that he would . It was established later that he was a 2d Battalion man who had been killed yesterday but who had not been found until just now because he had fallen a few feet over the crest . D Company had found him while pursuing the Japanese patrol and had placed him on the ledge behind C-for-Charlie for safekeeping at a time when C-for-Charlie was too engrossed in its firing to notice . In the meantime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and laughter had all died quietly away . Angry frowns began to appear . There was muttering . C-for-Charlie did not feel they had done anything to deserve him , and they resented his being palmed off on them . Several men who cautiously approached to within six or seven yards of him returned to say that he smelled . Not strongly yet perhaps , but enough to be upsetting . Soon cries were heard : " Medic ! Medic ! " " Where  | the hell 's the goddam medics ! " " Tell the medics to get that stiff out of here ! " Everyone was indignant . They came for him . Whether or not C-for-Charlie 's griping was the cause , they came for him . Two harrassed-Iooking men climbed up from below carrying a folded stretcher . They were obviously tired and looked very short-tempered . Seizing him by a stiffened arm and leg as if they were handles , they deposited him on their stretcher on his back ; but when they tried to lift it , he threatened to roll off . They put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time when they lifted he did roll off . The men dropped the stretcher and putting their hands on their hips , stared at each other with the air of men who have had about all they can support . Then , bending and seizing him by the handles of his arms and legs , they moved off with him that way , angling down the steep slope , one of them dragging the stretcher by a strap . They had said not one word to anyone . C-for-Charlie had watched all this action wide-eyed and with sheepish faces . They could not help feeling the two men were a little irreverent in their treatment of this newly dead man ; at the same time , they were aware that their own reaction smacked of irreverence too . Nobody wanted the poor bastard , now . Well , whatever he had accomplished for 2d Battalion in the last moments of his life , which apparently was not much , he had certainly accomplished something after his death . He had solidly and effectively put the quietus to C-for-Charlie 's short-lived mood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two-thirty . While these experiences were occupying C-for-Charlie 's attention , the battle round the bend which they could hear but not see had continued unabated . Now for the first time whole groups began to return from it . The attack had failed . Running , they would drop gasping over the crest and lie breathing in hysterical sobs with eyes like drilled holes dark in their outraged , furious , unbelieving faces . More and more groups kept coming in , haphazard , piecemeal , rarely even with their own squads . Everything was going to hell , they gasped . C-for-Charlie was close enough now to The Elephant 's Shoulder , where the main ridge turned and angled down to the forelegs and barrel , that as more and more men returned and spilled out along the interior slope , some of them  | spread over into C-for-Charlie 's area . A few even came dashing in through the extreme right of their line , hollering to them not to shoot , for God 's sake do n't shoot . Once inside they simply collapsed . One boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wept openly like a child , his forehead and hand resting on the shoulder of the man next to him , who patted him absently while staring straight ahead at nothing with smoldering eyes . None of them knew what the overall situation was , or had any idea of what was taking place anywhere except where they themselves had been . C-for-Charlie , feeling shamefaced , watched them quietly with a wide-eyed , awed hero worship , which no one could honestly say he wanted to lose , if it entailed  --  as it would  --  sharing their experiences . What they themselves felt was illustrated by an incident most of C-for-Charlie witnessed . It was not an intellectual reaction , nor could it honestly be called the reaction of a student of war . The division commander had been observing the day 's fighting from the crest of Hill 209 . Of course his career was involved in this offensive . When the groups began returning pellmell and shaken , he strode among them smiling and talking , trying to bolster them . " We 're not gon na @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Hunh ? They 're tough , but they 're not as tough as we are , are they ? " One boy , young enough to be the general 's son , if not his grandson , looked up at him from where he sat with distended eyes . " General , you go out there ! You go out there , general , you go out there ! " The general smiled at him , pityingly , and walked on . The boy did not even look after him . Half way down the main ridge the battalion aid station was filled to overflowing with more wounded than the three doctors could take care of , and more were still coming in . Along the rearward slopes of the basin leading to It ill 2o6 , where just since yesterday the jeep road had been extended forward , jeeps were coming as far out onto the steep slope as they dared to pick up the hand-carried litter cases , and red-and-white-splashed walking wounded tottered rearward in groups , trying to help each other . Finally the correlated news reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan had called for two companies to attack abreast after artillery preparation . Fox and George , the workhorses  | of yesterday , were given the dirtiest work . They were to assault Hill 210 , on the left . E-for-Easy was to attack right , into the area of the Elephant 's Forelegs labeled Hill 214 . Beyond Hill 209 on the left the short , fat Elephant 's Neck rose slowly to the eminence of Hill 210 , a U shaped ridge with its open end toward the attackers ? to go up there was like walking down a bowling alley toward the bowlers , and before the battle was over that was what it came to be called : The Bowling Alley . This area , as well as the couple of hundred yards of open ground immediately in front , was cut by numerous low ridges and hills which might afford protection to attacking troops . On the right , divided from The Elephant 's Head by a lowlying salient of jungle , the broader , lower , more level area of The Elephant 's Forelegs spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never seen by C-for-Charlie , which 2d Battalion had had to attack . Everything had begun to go wrong almost immediately . First of all there was very little water , hardly half a canteen per man . Fox had led off , followed by George , who were to come abreast of them later for the assault up both sides of The Bowling Alley . But almost at once Fox was caught in a narrow impasse between two of the preliminary ridges . Heavy fire from in front stopped them . jammed in the narrow space they were hit repeatedly by mortars which apparently had the ranges all taped out . When they tried to maneuver and work out of it , heavy flanking machinegun fire from hidden emplacements forced them back . George , immediately behind them , could do nothing either and suffered their own mortar casualties . The two companies had remained there through most of the morning and through the early afternoon . Fox Co 's commander was hit by mortar fire around twelve-thirty and was evacuated , but died on the way back to Regiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tropic sun and the heavy fire many men , still exhausted from yesterday and waterless today , passed out . When the battalion commander gave the order to retreat , the two companies had broken in rout and returned in bunches . E-for-Easy 's attack was likewise a failure . The lead platoon , moving out onto the broader , but flatter area of The Elephant 's Forelegs , had been caught in a withering crossfire from the jungle on its right and left . Easy 's commander , trying to send up an attached  | machinegun platoon from H , had them almost annihilated . And after that the rest of the company did not try to move and remained just a few yards in front of the crest of Hill 209 . That was the story . By three-thirty all those who were able had returned . Medical parties , at considerable risk , were searching out the others . There was no dictated bulletin that night by the regimental commander . Casualties for the day were 34 killed and 102 wounded . Speculations as to why , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than yesterday 's , were left without any answer . The only reasonable thing to say was that yesterday there had been more hours of actual fighting . But more important than all of this news was the news that the regimental commander had ordered the exhausted 2d Battalion back to Hills 207 and 208 into regimental reserve . This meant that tomorrow 1st Battalion would take over the attack . The battalion from the division 's reserve regiment on their left would then , undoubtedly , take over their lines on Hill 209 . This was exactly what happened , and their orders reached them soon enough . There had existed a remote possibility that the regimental commander might order the battalion of the division reserve to make the attack , and C-for-Charlie clung to this hopefully , but nobody really believed it . Their orders , which reached them around six o'clock , confirmed their wisdom . Colonel Tall 's plan was not radically different from the 2d Battalion 's colonel . Two companies would attack abreast ; C-for-Charlie would be on the left and would capture The Elephant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right would move into The Elephant 's Forelegs , Hill 214 , and hook up there with the 3d Battalion who were encountering less resistance . Baker would be in reserve behind Charlie . The plan was really no different from today 's . The only difference was that tomorrow there would be water and whatever casualties 2d Battalion may have inflicted today , if any . C-for-Charlie had drawn the worst assignment : the Bowling Alley . They believed the drawing of the worst assignment to be their perpetual destiny . And that evening when a company of the divisional reserve battalion moved in to take over their slit trenches so that they might rest up for tomorrow , C-for-Charlie received them with-  | out friendship . They came smiling and talking , filled with flattering hero worship and eager to please , because they believed C-forCharlie to be veterans and themselves green ; and C-for-Charlie treated them to the same morose silences which yesterday morning they themselves had received from E-for-Easy going up to attack . But some time before any of this had happened , young Pfc Bead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be killed by his company , or for that matter by his battalion . It was , Bead reflected about it later , when indeed he was able to think about it at all , which was not for some time , typical of his entire life ; of his stupid incompetence , his foolish idiocy , his gross mismanagement of everything he put his hands on ; so that whatever he did , done so badly and in such ugly style , gave no satisfaction : action without honor , travail without grace . A man of a different temperament might have found it funny ; Bead could not laugh . At just about five o'clock he had had to take a crap . And he had not had a crap for two days . Everything had quieted down on the line by five and at the aid station below them the last of the wounded were being cared for and sent back . Bead had seen other men taking craps along the slope , and he knew the procedure . After two days on these slopes the procedure was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was occupied , jammed with men and equipment , crapping was relegated to the steeper slopes . Here the process was to take along an entrenching shovel and dig a little hole , then turn your backside to the winds of the open air and squat , balancing yourself precariously on your toes , supporting yourself on the dirt or rocks in front of you with your hands . The effect , because of the men below in the basin , was rather like hanging your ass out of a tenth floor window above a crowded street . It was an embarrassing position to say the least , and the men below were not above taking advantage of it with catcalls , whistles or loud soulful sighs . Bead was shy . He could have done it that way if he 'd had to , but because he was shy , and because now everything had quieted down to an unbelievable evening peace after the terror , noise and danger of the afternoon , he decided to have himself a pleasant , quiet , private crap in keeping with the peacefulness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of his equipment by his hole and taking only his GI roll of toilet paper , he started to climb the twenty yards to the crest . He did not even take an entrenching tool because on the other side there was no need to bury his stool . Beyond the crest he knew that the slope did not drop precipitously as it did further to the left , but fell slowly for perhaps fifty yards through the trees before it plunged in a bluff straight down to the river . This was where D Company had caught the Japanese patrol earlier in the day . " Hey , bud , where you going ? " somebody from the 2d Platoon called to him as he passed through . " To take a shit , " Bead called back without looking around and disappeared over the crest . The trees began three yards below the actual crest . Because the jungle was thinner with less undergrowth here at its outer edge , it looked more like the columnar , smooth-floored woods of home and made Bead think of when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boy Scout he had camped out and crapped with peaceful pleasure in the summer woods of Iowa , he placed the roll of paper comfortably near , dropped his pants and squatted . Half way through with relieving himself , he looked up and saw a Japanese man with a bayoneted rifle moving stealthily through the trees ten yards away . As if feeling his gaze , the Japanese man turned his head and saw him in almost the same instant but not before , through the electrifying , heart stabbing thrill of apprehension , danger , disbelief , denial , Bead got a clear , burned in the brain impression of him . He was a small man , and thin ; very thin . His mud-slicked , mustard-khaki uniform with its ridiculous wrap leggins hung from him in junglcdamp , greasy folds . Not only did he not wear any of the elaborate camouflage Bead had been taught by movies to expect , he did not even wear a helmet . Ile wore a greasy , wrinkled , bent up forage cap . Beneath it his yellowbrown face was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through his skin . He was badly unshaven , perhaps two weeks , but his greasy looking beard was as straggly as Bead 's nineteen-year-old one . As to age , Bead could not form any clear impression ; he might have been twenty , or forty .  | All of this visual perception occurred in an eyewink of time , an eyewink which seemed to coast on and on and on , then the Japanese man saw him too and turning , all in one movement , began to run at him , but moving cautiously , the bayonet on the end of his rifle extended . Bead , still squatting with his pants down , his behind still dirty , gathered his weight under him . He was going to have to try to jump one way or another , but which ? Which side to jump to ? Am I going to die ? Am I really going to die now ? He did not even have his knife with him . Terror and disbelief , denial , fought each other in him . Why the Japanese did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps he was afraid of being heard in the American lines . Instead he came on , obviously meaning to bayonet Bead where he sat . His eyes were intent with purpose . His lips were drawn back from his teeth , which were large , but were well formed and not at all protruding as in the posters . Was it really true ? In desperation , still not knowing which way to try to jump , all in one movement Bead pulled up his pants over his dirty behind to free his legs and dove forward in a low , shoestring football tackle when the Japanese man was almost to him , taking him around the ankles , his feet driving hard in the soft ground . Surprised , the Japanese man brought the rifle down sharply , but Bead was already in under the bayonet . The stacking swivel banged him painfully on the collarbone . By clasping the mudcaked shins against his chest and using his head for a fulcrum , still driving hard with his feet , the Japanese man had no way to fall except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before he hit the ground . In the fall he dropped the rifle and had the wind knocked out of him . This gave Bead time to hitch up his pants again and spring upward once more until , kneeling on his upper arms and sitting back on his chest , he began to punch and claw him in the face and neck . The Japanese man could only pluck feebly at his legs and forearms . Bead heard a high , keening scream and thought it was the Japanese begging for mercy until finally he slowly became aware that the Japanese man was now unconscious . Then he realized it was himself making that animal scream . He could not , however , stop it .  | The Japanese man 's face was now running blood from the clawing , and several of his teeth had been broken back into his throat from the punches . But Bead could not stop . Sobbing and wailing , he continued to belabor the unconscious Japanese with fingernail and fist . He wanted to tear his face off with his bare hands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tried to break his head by beating it on the soft ground but only succeeded in digging a small hole with it . Exhausted finally , he collapsed forward on hands and knees above the bleeding , unconscious man , only to feel the Japanese immediately twitch with life beneath him . Outraged at such a display of vitality , alternately sobbing and wailing , Bead rolled aside , seized the enemy rifle and on his knees raised it above his head and drove the long bayonet almost full length into the Japanese chest . The Japanese man 's body convulsed in a single spasm . His eyes opened , staring horribly at nothing , and his hands flipped up from the elbows and seized the blade through his chest . Staring with horror at the fingers which were cutting themselves on the blade trying to draw it out , Bead leaped to his feet and his pants fell down . Hiking his pants up and standing spraddlelegged to keep them from falling , he seized the rifle and tried to pull it out in order to plunge it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Remembering dimly something he had been taught in bayonet practice , he grabbed the small of the stock and pulled the trigger . Nothing happened . The gun was on safety . Fumbling with the unfamiliar , foreign safety , he released it and pulled again . There was a flesh-muffled explosion and the bayonet came free . But the fool of a Japanese with his open eyes went on grasping at his chest with his bleeding fingers as if he could not get it through his thick head that the bayonet was out . My god , how much killing did the damned fool require ? Bead had beaten limn , kicked him , choked him , clawed him , bayoneted him , shot him . I lc had a sudden frantic vision of himself , by rights the victor , ( loomed forever to kill perpetually the same single Japanese . This time , not intending to be caught in the same trap twice , instead of sticking him he reversed the rifle in his hands and drove the butt down full force into his face , smashing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he drove the rifle butt  | again and again into the Japanese man 's face , until all of the face and most of the head were mingled with the muddy ground . Then he threw the rifle from him and fell down on his hands and knees and began to vomit . Bead did not lose consciousness , but he completely lost his sense of time . When he came to himself , still on hands and knees , gasping , he shook his hanging head and opened his eyes and discovered his left hand was resting in a friendly way on the Japanese man 's still , mustard-khaki knee . Bead snatched it away as though he had discovered it lying across a burning stove . He had an obscure feeling that if he did not look at the corpse of the man he had killed or touch it , he would not be held responsible . With this in mind he crawled feebly away through the trees , breathing in long painful groans . The woods were very quiet . Bead could not remember ever having heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this quiet , he heard voices , American voices , and the casual sound of a shovel scraped against a rock . It seemed impossible that they could be that close . He got shakily to his feet holding up his pants . It also seemed impossible that anything could ever again sound as casual as that shovel had . He knew he had to get back inside the lines . But first he would have to try to clean himself up . He was a mess . He had no desire to finish his crap . First of all , he had to go back to the vicinity of the dead man to get his roll of toilet paper . He hated that but there was n't any choice . His pants and his dirty behind were what bothered him most . Horror of that was inbred in him ; but also he was terrified someone might think he had crapped his pants from fear . He used most of his roll of toilet paper on that , and in the end even sacrificed one of his three clean handkerchiefs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it with spittle . In addition he was spattered with blood and vomit . He could not remove every stain , but he tried to get enough so that nobody would notice . Because he had already decided he was not going to mention this to anybody . Also , he had lost his glasses . He found them , miraculously unbroken , beside the dead man . Searching for his glasses , he had to go right up to the body , and to look at it closely . The faceless ? almost headless  --  corpse with its bloody , cut fingers and the mangled  | hole in its chest , so short a time ago a living , breathing man , made him so dizzy in the stomach that he thought he might faint . On the other hand , he could not forget the intent look of deliberate purpose on the man 's face as he came in with the bayonet . There did n't seem to be any reasonable answer . The feet were the saddest thing . In their hobnailed infantry boots they splayed outward , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With a kind of perverse fascination Bead could not resist giving one of them a little kick . It lolloped up , then flopped back . Bead wanted to turn and run . He could not escape a feeling that , especially now , after he 'd both looked and touched , some agent of retribution would try to hold him responsible . He wanted to beg the man 's forgiveness in the hope of forestalling responsibility . He had not felt such oppressive guilt over anything since the last time his mother had caught and whipped him for masturbating . If he 'd had to kill him , and apparently he had , at least he could have done it more efficiently and gracefully , and with less pain and anguish for the poor man . If he had not lost his head , had not gone crazy with fear , perhaps he might even have taken him prisoner and obtained valuable information from him . But he had been frantic to get the killing over with , as if afraid that as long as the man could breathe he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a mental picture of them both with positions reversed : of himself lying there and feeling that blade plunge through his chest ; of himself watching that riflebutt descend upon his face , with the final fire-exploding end . It made him so weak that he had to sit down . What if the other man had got the bayonet down quicker ? What if he himself had tackled a little higher ? Instead of merely a bruise on his collarbone , Bead saw himself spitted through the soft of the shoulder , head on , that crude blade descending into the soft dark of his chest cavity . He could not believe it . Settling his glasses on his face , taking a couple of deep breaths and a last look at his ruined enemy , he got up and started clumping up out of the trees toward the crest . Bead was ashamed and embarrassed by the whole thing , that was the truth , and that was why he did n't want to mention it to anybody . He got back through the line all right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the man from the 2d Platoon called to him . " Yeah , " he mumbled and clomped on , down the slope toward the CP . But on his way he was joined by Pfc Doll , on his way down from 1st Platoon with a message to ask again about water . Doll fell in step with him , and immediately noticed his damaged hands and the blood spatters . " Christ ! What happened to your knuckles ? You have a fight with somebody ? " Bead 's heart sank . It would have to be Doll . " No . I slipped and fell and skinned myself , " he said . He was as stiff and sore all over as if he had had a fistfight with somebody . Horror welled in him again , suddenly , ballooningly . He took several very deep breaths into a sore rib cage . Doll grinned with frank but amiable skepticism . " And I spose all them little blood splatters come from your knuckles ? " " Leave me alone , Doll ! " Bead blazed up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just leave me alone , hunh ? Will you ? " He tried to put into his eyes all the fierce toughness of a man just returned from killing an enemy . He hoped maybe that would shut hint up , and it did . At least for a while . They walked on down in silence , Bead aware with a kind of horrified disgust that already he was fitting the killing of the Japanese man into the playing of a role ; a role without anything , no reality , of himself or anything else . It had n't been like that at all . Doll did not stay shut up , though . Doll had been a little taken aback by Bead 's vehemence , a forcefulness he was not used to expecting from Bead . He could smell something when he saw it . And after he had delivered his message , receiving the answer he expected which was that Stein was doing everything he could to get them water , he brought it up again , this time by calling it to the attention of Welsh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their holes matching pennies for cigarettes , which were already beginning to be precious . They would match four best out of seven , to lengthen the game and cut down the expense in cigarettes , then both pull out their plastic pack holders which everyone had bought to keep their butts dry and carefully pass the one tube between them . Doll went over to them grinning with his eyebrow raised . He  | did not feel , at least not at the time , that what he was doing had anything to do with ratting on someone or stooling . " What the fuck happen to your boy there ? Who the hell he beat up with them skinned knuckles and all them blood splatters on him ? Did I miss somethin ? " Welsh looked up at him with that level gaze of his which , when he was n't pretending to be crazy , could be so penetrating . Already , Doll felt he had made a mistake , and guilty . Without answering Welsh turned to look at Bead , who sat hunched up by himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his equipment . " Bead , come over here ! " Bead got up and came , still hunched , his face drawn . Doll grinned at him with his raised eyebrow . Welsh looked him up and down . " What happened to you ? " " Who ? Me ? " Welsh waited in silence . " Well , I slipped and fell down and skinned myself , that 's all . " Welsh eyed him in silence , thoughtfully . Obviously he was not even bothering with that story . " Where 'd you go a while ago ? When you were gone for a while ? Where were you ? " " I went off to take a crap by myself . " " Wait ! " Doll put in , grinning . " When I seen him , he was comin down from the 2d Platoon 's section of line on the ridge . " Welsh swung his gaze to Doll and his eyes blazed murderously . Doll subsided . Welsh looked back at Bead . Stein , who had been standing nearby , had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fife and some of the others . " Lissen , kid , " Welsh said . " I got more problems than I know what to do with itt this screwy outfit . Or how to handle . I got no time to fuck around with kid games . I want to know what happened to you , and I want the truth . Look at yourself ! Now , what happened , and where were you ? " Welsh apparently , at least to Bead 's eyes , was much closer to guessing the truth than the unimaginative Doll , or the others . Bead drew a long quavering breath . " Well , I went across the ridge outside the line in the trees to take a crap in private . A Jap guy came up while I was there and he  | tried to bayonet me . And  --  and I killed him . " Bead exhaled a long , fluttering breath , then inhaled sharply and gulped . Everyone was staring at him disbelievingly , but nevertheless dumbstruck . " Goddam it , kid ! " Welsh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted the goddam fucking truth ! And not no kid games ! " It had never occurred to Bead that he would not be believed . Now he was faced with a choice of shutting up and being taken for a liar , or telling them where and having them see what a shameful botched-up job he 'd done . Even in his upset and distress it did not take him long to choose . " Then god damn you go and look ! " he cried at Welsh . " Do nt take my word , go and look for your goddam fucking self ! " " I 'll go ! " Doll put in immediately . Welsh turned to glare at him . " You 'll go nowhere , stooly , " he said . He turned back to Bead . " I 'll go myself . " Doll had subsided into a stunned , shocked , whitefaced silence . It had never occurred to Doll that his joking about Bead would be taken as stoolpigeoning . But then he had never imagined the result would turn out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! He was not guilty of stooling , and furiously he made up his mind that he was going along ; if he had to crawl . " And if you 're lyin , kid , God help your fucking soul . " Welsh picked up his Thompsongun and put on his helmet . " All right . Where is it ? Come on , show me . " " I 'm not going up there again ! " Bead cried . " You want to go , go by yourself ! But I ai nt going ! And nothin 's gon na make me ! " Welsh stared at him narrowly a moment . Then he looked at Storm . Storm nodded and got up . " Okay , " Welsh said . " Where is it , then ? " " A few yards in the trees beyond the crest , at the middle of the 2d Platoon . Just about in front of Krim 's hole . " Bead turned and walked away . Storm had put on his helmet and picked up his own Thompson . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the scene , the whole thing became another larking , kidding excursion of the " Tommygun Club " which had held the infiltrator  | hunt that morning . Stein , who had been listening in silence nearby all the time , dampened it by refusing to allow any of the officers to leave the CP ; but MacTae could go , and it was the three sergeants and Dale who prepared to climb to the crest . Bead could not resist calling a bitter comment from his rock : " You wo n't need all the goddamned artillery , Welsh ! There 's nobody up there now but him ! " But he was ignored . It was just before they departed that Doll , his eyes uneasy but nonetheless steady , presented himself manfully in front of the First Sergeant and gazed at him squarely . " Top , you would n't keep me from goin , would you ? " he asked . It was not begging nor was it a try at being threatening , just a simple , level , straightforward question . Welsh stared at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away silently . It was obviously a reprimand . Doll chose to take it as silent acquiescence . And with himself in the rear the five of them started the climb to the line . Welsh did not send him back . While they were gone no one bothered Bead . He sat by himself on his rock , head down , now and then squeezing his hands or feeling his knuckles . Everyone avoided looking at him , as if to give him privacy . The truth was nobody really knew what to think . As for Bead himself , all he could think about was how shamefully he and his hysterical , graceless killing were going to be exposed . His memory of it , and of that resolute face coming at him , made him shudder and want to gag . More times than not he wished he had kept his mouth shut and let them all think him a crazy liar . It might have been much better . When the little scouting party returned , their faces all wore a peculiar look . " He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " MacTae said . All of them looked curiously subdued . That was all that was said . At least , it was all that was said in front of Bead . What they said away from him , Bead could not know . But he did not find in their faces any of the disgust or horror of him that he had expected . If anything , he found a little of the reverse : admiration . As they separated to go to their various holes , each made some gesture . Doll had hunted up the Japanese rifle and brought it back for  | Bead . He had scrubbed most of the blood and matter from the buttplate with leaves and had cleaned up the bayonet . He brought it over and presented it as if presenting an apology offering . " Here , this is yours . " Bead looked at it without feeling anything . " I do nt want it . " " But you won it . And won it the hard way . " " I do nt want it anyway . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can trade it for whiskey . " Doll laid it down . " And here 's his wallet . Welsh said to give it to you . There 's a picture of his wife in it . " " Jesus Christ , Doll . " Doll smiled . " There 's pictures of other broads , too , " he hurried on . " Filipino , it looks like . Maybe he was in the Philippines . That 's Filipino writing on the back , Welsh says . " " I do nt want it anyway . You keep it . " But he took the proffered wallet anyway , his curiosity piqued in spite of himself . " Well ? " He looked at it . It was dark , greasy from much sweating . " I do nt feel good about it , Doll , " he said looking up , wanting suddenly to talk about it to someone . " I feel guilty . " " Guilty ! What the hell for ? It was him or you , was n't it ? How many our guys you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? On the Death March . How about those two guys yes-terday ? " " I know all that . But I ca n't help it . I feel guilty . " " But why ! " " Why ! Why ! How the fuck do I know why ! " Bead cried . " Maybe my mother beat me up too many times for jerking off when I was a kid ! " he cried plaintively , with a sudden half-flashing of miserable insight . " How do I know why ! " Doll stared at him uncomprehendingly . " Never mind , " Bead said . " Listen , " Doll said . " If you really do nt want that wallet . " Bead felt a sudden clutching greed . He put the wallet in his pocket quickly . " No . No , I 'll keep it . No , I might as well keep it . " " Well , " Doll said sorrowfully , " I got to get back up to the platoon . " " Thanks anyway , Doll , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . " I 'll say one thing . When you set out to kill him , you really killed him , " he said admiringly . Bead jerked his head up , his eyes searching . " You think so ? " he said . Slowly he began to grin a little . Doll was nodding , his face boyish with his admiration . " I ai nt the only one . " He turned and left , heading up the slope . Bead stared after him , still not knowing what he really felt . And Doll had said he was n't the only one . If they did not find it such a disgraceful , botched-up job , then at least he need not feel so bad about that . Tentatively he grinned a little wider , a little more expansively , aware that his face felt stiff doing it . A little later on Bugger Stein came over to him . Stein had remained in the background up to now . The news of Bead 's Japanese had of course spread through the whole company at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the line , they looked at Bead as though he were a different person . Bead was not sure whether he enjoyed this or not , but had decided that he did . He was not surprised when Stein came over . Bead was sitting on the edge of his hole when Stein appeared , jumped down in and sat down beside him . Nobody else was around . Stein adjusted his glasses in that nervous way he had , the four fingers on top of one frame , the thumb beneath , and then put his hand on Bead 's knee in a fatherly way and turned to look at him . His face was earnest and troubled-looking . " Bead , I know you 've been pretty upset by what happened to you today . That 's unavoidable . Anybody would be . I thought perhaps you might like to talk about it , and maybe relieve yourself a little . I do nt know that what I would have to say to you about it would be of any help , but I 'm willing to try . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , giving his knee a couple of pats , turned and looked sadly off across the basin toward Hill 207 , the command post of yesterday . " Our society makes certain demands and requires certain sacrifices of us , if we want to live in it and partake of its benefits . I 'm not saying whether this is right or wrong . But we really have no choice . We have to do as society demands . One of these demands is the killing of other humans in armed combat in time of war ,  | when our society is being attacked and must defend itself . That was what happened to you today . Only most men who have to do this are luckier than you . They do their first killing at a distance , however small . They have a chance , however small , to get used to it before having to kill hand to hand and face to face . I think I know what you must have felt . " Stein paused . Bead did not know what to say to all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stein turned and looked at him for some answer , he said " Yes , sir . " " Well , I just want you to know that you were morally justified in what you did . You had no choice , and you must n't worry or feel guilty about it . You only did what any other good soldier would have done , for our country or any other . " Bead listened incredulously . When Stein paused again , he did not know what to say so he did n't say anything . Stein looked off across the basin . " I know it 's tough . You and I may have had our little differences , Bead . But I want you to know ? " his voice choked slightly ? " I want you to know that after this war is over , if there is anything I can ever do for you , just get in touch with inc . I 'll do everything I possibly can to help you . " Without looking at Bead he got up , patted him on the shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had done after Doll . He still did not know what he really felt . Nobody told him anything that made any sense . But he realized now , quite suddenly , that he could survive the killing of many men . Because already the immediacy of the act itself , only minutes ago so very sharp , was fading . He could look at it now without pain , perhaps even with pride , in a way , because now it was only an idea like a scene in a play , and did not really hurt anyone . He was not given much time to speculate on this point , however . By the time Stein , in leaving Bead 's hole , had arrived back at his own , the messenger with tomorrow 's dispositions had arrived and was waiting for him . They were to move out immediately , down into the basin and around the curve of the ridge , as soon as the reserve battalion could take over for them .  | They already knew of course that 2d Battalion was being pulled out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the slopes . There was only one logical answer to this . C-for-Charlie however had prefered not to believe it . Now it had come . The relief platoons began to cone in fifteen minutes later , smiling and obsequious , somehow guiltyfaced . C-for-Charlie was already packed and was glad to get away from them quickly . There was no point in talking about it . One by one the squads came down from the top past the CI ' and continued on down , angling off across the steep slope toward the bottom . At the head of the basin where Hill 209 cut across the fall of the land like a dam , the bottom was much less deep than further down , perhaps only fifty yards from the crest , and this was where they were to congregate . The HQ and the mortars left last , following the platoons . There had been very little to pack . The incoming platoons still carried their combat packs , complete with meatcan , entrenching tool , raincoat , etc . C-for-Charlies had already dispensed with these . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had his entrenching tool hooked to his belt . A few lugged their raincoats along over one shoulder . Bugger Stein and his opposite number , when Stein made the official turnover , reacted exactly as their troops had . The other captain , a man of Stein 's age , smiled apologetically and offered his hand which Stein took perfunctorily . " Good luck ! " he called softly as Stein moved off after his men . Stein , with a lump of excitement and tension filling his throat , did not think it worth the effort to swallow one half and cough up the other in order to make a pointless answer , and only bobbed his head without looking back . He , like his men , only wanted to get away quickly , and especially without having to talk . But down in the bottom they found others who wanted to talk to them . Bars of I ) ration chocolate wine pressed upon them by the reserve platoons stationed there . They were given first pick at the C rations for their suppers . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was almost dark , and over an hour was consumed in making sure each man had two full canteens of water . Stein and the officers went off for a flashlight briefing in a small  | ditch with Colonel Tall , an older man though not as much older as the generals , lean and boyish and burrheaded , a West Pointer . he had been trained in all this as his life work . They came back looking solemn . Tall had told them the corps commander as well as the division commander would be watching tomorrow . Men spread themselves out in holes dug by other , unknown men or in little erosion ditches and tried to force sleep upon bodies which kept shooting messages of reluctance along humming nerves . In the night it rained only once , but it was a very hard rain which wet everyone to the skin , and woke those who had managed to doze.  | DAWN CAME , AND PASSED , AND STILL THEY WAITED . The roses and blues of the dawn light changed to the pearl and misty greys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , and nervously ready , since long before dawn . But for today Colonel Tall had requested a new artillery wrinkle . Because of yesterday 's heavy repulse , Tall had asked for , and got , an artillery time-ontarget " shoot . " This device , an artillery technique left over from World War I , was a method of calculating so that the first rounds of every battery hit their various targets simultaneously . Under TOT fire men caught in the open would suddenly find themselves enveloped in a curtain of murderous fire without the usual warning of a few shells arriving early from the nearest guns . The thing to do was to wait a bit , play poker with them , try to catch them when they were out of their holes for breakfast or an early morning stretch . So they waited . Along the crest the silent troops stared across a silent ravine to the silent hilltop , and the silent hill stared back . C-for-Charlie , waiting with the assault companies on the slope below , could not even see this much . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in total and unspeakable insularity , so many separate small islands . To their right and to their left A-for-Able and B-for-Baker did the same . At exactly twenty-two minutes after first daylight Colonel Tall 's requested TOT fire struck , an earthcracking , solidly tangible ,  | continuous roar on Hill 21o . The artillery fired three-minute concentrations at irregular intervals , hoping to catch the survivors out of their holes . Twenty minutes later , and before the barrage itself was ended , whistles began to blow along the crest of Hill 209 . The assault companies had no recourse except to begin to move . Minds cast frantically about for legitimate last minute excuses , and found none . In the men themselves nervous fear and anxiety , contained so long and with such effort in order to appear brave , now began to come out in yelled exhortations and yelps of gross false enthusiasm . They moved up the slope ; and in bunches , crouching low and carrying their rifles in one or both hands , they hopped over the crest and commenced to run sideways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rocky ground in front . Men in the line shouted encouragement to them as they passed through . A small cheer , dwarfed by the distant mountains , rose and died . A few slapped some of them toughly on the shoulder as they went through . Men who would not die today winked lustily. at men who , in some cases , would soon be dead . On C-for-Charlie 's right fifty yards away A-for-Able was going through an identical ritual . They were rested . At least , they were comparatively so ; they had not had to stand watch one half of the night , and they had not been up on the line where jitters precluded sleep , but down below , protected . And they had been fed . And watered . If few of them had slept much , at least they were better off than the men on the line . Corporal Fife was one of those who had slept the least . He still could not get over little Bead 's having killed that Jap like that . What with that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rain , and his nervous excitation about the morrow , he had only dozed once for about five minutes . But the loss of sleep did not bother him . He was young , and healthy , and fairly strong . In fact , he had never felt healthier or in better shape in his life ; and earlier in the day , in the first gray of early light , he had stood forth upon the slope and , exuding energy and vitality , had looked a long time down the ravine as it fell and deepened toward the rear until he wanted to spread wide his arms with sacrifice and love of life and love of men . He did n't do it of course . There were men awake all round him . But he had wanted to . And now as he dropped over the ridge and into the  | beginning of the battle , he shot one swift look behind him , one last look , and found himself staring headon into the wide , brown , spectacle-covered eyes of Bugger Stein , who happened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last look ! Fife thought sourly . Stein thought he had never seen such a deep , dark , intense , angrily haunted look as that which Fife bent on him as they dropped over the ridge , and Stein thought it was directed at him . At him , personally . They two were almost the last to go . Only Sergeant Welsh and young Bead remained behind them . And when Stein looked back , they were coming , hunched low , chopping with their feet , sliding down the shale and dirt of the slope . Stein 's dispositions had been the same today as in the two previous days . They had done nothing much and he saw no reason to change the march order : 1st Platoon first , 2d Platoon second , 3d in reserve . One of the two machineguns went with each forward platoon ; the mortars would stay with the Company HQ and the reserve . That was the way they had moved out . And as Stein slid to the bottom of 209 's short forward slope he could see 1st @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folds of ground which ran across their line of advance . They were about a hundred yards ahead and appeared to be deployed well . There were three of these little folds in the ground . All of them were perpendicular to the south face of Hill 209 , parallel to each other . It had been Stein 's idea , when inspecting the terrain with Colonel Tall the evening before , to utilize these as cover by shoving off from the right end of the hill and then advancing left across them and across his own front  --  instead of getting himself caught in the steeper ravine immediately between the two hills , as had happened to Fox Co . Tall had agreed to this . Afterward , Stein had ! briefed his own officers on it . Kneeling just behind the crest with them in the fading light , he pointed it all out and they looked it over . Somewhere in the dusk a sniper 's rifle had spat angrily . One by one they inspected it through binoculars . The third and furthest left of these three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning of the slope which became the Elephant 's Neck . This slope steepened as it climbed to the U-shaped eminence of the Elephant 's Head , which from five hundred yards  | beyond commanded and brooded over the entire area . This hundred and fifty yard low area , as well as the third fold , was dominated by two lesser , grassy ridges growing out of the slope and two hundred yards apart , one on either side of the low area . Both ridges were at right angles to the folds of ground and parallel to the line of advance . With these in their hands plus the Elephant 's Head , the Japanese could put down a terrible fire over the whole approach area . Tall 's plan was for the forward elements to move up onto these two ridges , locating and eliminating the hidden strong points there which had stopped 2d Battalion yesterday , and then with the reserve company to reinforce them , work their way up the Elephant 's Neck to take the The Head . This was the Bowling Alley . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left it fell in a precipitous slope to the river , and on the right the Japanese held the jungle in force . It had to be taken frontally . All of this Stein had lined out for his officers last evening . Now they were preparing to execute it . Stein , at the bottom of the shale slope , could see very little of anything . A great racketing of noise had commenced and hung everywhere in the air without seeming to have-any source . Part of course was due to his own side firing all along the line , and the bombardment and the mortars . Perhaps the Japanese were firing too now . But he could see no visual signs of it . What time was it , anyway ? Stein looked at his watch , and its little face stared back at him with an intensity it had never had before . 6:45 ; a quarter to seven in the morning . Back home he would be just  --  Stein realized he had never really seen his watch . He forced himself to put his arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Platoon were spread out and flattened behind the first of the three little folds of ground . ' With them were the Company HQ and the mortar section . Most of them were looking at him with faces as intense as his watch 's face . Stein ran crouching over to them , his equipment bouncing and banging on him , shouting for them to set up the mortars there , motioning with his hand . Then he realized that he could only just barely hear his own voice himself , with all this banging and racketing of doom bouncing around in the air . How could they hear him ? He wondered how the 1st Platoon  --  and the 2d  --  were doing , and how he could see .  | The 1st Platoon , at that particular moment , was spread out and flattened behind the middle of the three little folds of ground . Behind it the 2d Platoon was spread out and flattened in the low between the folds . Nobody really wanted to move . Young Lt Whyte had already looked over the area between this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already had motioned for his two scouts to proceed there . Now he motioned to them again , using an additional hand-and-arum signal meaning " speed . " The booming and banging and racketing in the air was bothering Whyte , too . It did not seem to come from any one place or several places , but simply hung and jounced in the air , sourceless . He too could see no visual end results of so much banging and exploding . His two scouts still not having moved , Whyte became angry and opened his mouth and bellowed at them , motioning again . They could not hear him of course , but he knew they could see the black open hole of his mouth . Both of them stared at him as though they thought him insane for even suggesting such a thing , but this time , after a moment , they moved . Almost side by side they leaped up , crossed the crest of the little fold , and ran crouching down to the low where they flattened themselves . After a moment they leaped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ran bent almost double to the top of the last fold and fell flat . After another moment and a perfunctory peek over its top , they motioned Whyte to come on . Whyte jumped up making a sweeping forward motion with his arm and ran forward , his platoon behind him . As the 1st Platoon moved , making the crossing as the scouts had : in two rushes , the 2d Platoon moved to the top of the middle fold . Back at the first fold of ground Stein had seen this move and been a little reassured by it . Creeping close to the top of the fold among his men , the had raised himself to his knees to see , his face and whole patches of his skin twitching with mad alarm in an effort to call his insanity to his attention . When nothing hit him immediately , he stayed up , standing on his knees , to see 1st Platoon leave the middle fold and arrive at time crest of the third . At least they had got that far . Maybe it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , feeling quite proud , and realized his flattened men around him had been staring at him intently . He felt even prouder . Behind him , in the low of the fold , the mortar squads were setting up their mortars .  | Crawling back to them through the infernal racketing still floating loose in the air , he shouted in Culp 's ear for him to make the lefthand grassy ridge his target . At the mortars Private Mazzi , the Italian boy from the Bronx , stared at him with wide , frightened eyes . So did most of the others . Stein crawled back to the top of the fold . He arrived , and raised himself , just in time to see 1st Platoon and then 2d Platoon attack . He was the only man along the top of the first fold who did see it , because he was the only man who was not flattened on the ground . He bit his lip . Even from here he could tell that it was bad , a serious tactical blunder . If tactical blunder it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and secondly , Lt Tom Blane of the 2d Platoon . Whyte had arrived at the top of the third and last fold of ground without a casualty . This in itself seemed strange to him , if not highly overoptimistic . He knew his orders : he was to locate and eliminate the hidden strong points on the two grassy ridges . The nearest of these , the righthand one , had its rather sharply defined beginnings about eighty yards to his right front . While his men flattened themselves and stared at him with intense sweating faces , he raised himself cautiously on his elbows till only his eyes showed , and inspected the terrain . Before him the ground fell , sparsely grassed and rocky , until it reached the beginnings of the little ridge , where it immediately became thickly grassed with the brown , waist-high grass . He could not see anything that looked like Japanese or their emplacements . Whyte was scared , but his anxiety to do well today was stronger . He did not really believe he would be killed in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ridge of Hill 209 where groups of men stood half-exposed , watching . One of them was the corps commander . The loud banging and racketing hanging sourceless in the air had abated somewhat , had raised itself a few yards , after the lifting of the barrage from the little ridges to the Elephant 's Head . Again Whyte looked at the terrain and then motioned his scouts forward . Once again the two riflemen stared at him as though they thought he had lost his mind , as though they would have liked to reason with him if they had n't feared losing their reputations . Again Whyte motioned them forward , jerking his arm up and down in the signal for speed . The men looked at each other , then , gathering themselves on  | hands and knees first , bounced up and sprinted twenty-five yards down into the low area and fell flat . After a moment in which they inspected and found themselves still alive , they gathered themselves again . On hands and knees , preparing to rise , the first one suddenly fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way behind him , got a little further up so that when he fell he tumbled on his shoulder and rolled onto his back . And there they lay , both victims of well placed rifle shots by unseen riflemen . Neither moved again . Both were obviously dead . Whyte stared at them shocked . He had known them almost four months . He had heard no shots nor had he seen anything move . No bullets kicked up dirt anywhere in front . Again he stared at the quiet , masked face of the deserted little ridge . What was he supposed to do now ? The high , sourceless racketing in the air seemed to have gotten a little louder . Whyte , who was a meaty , big young man , had been a champion boxer and champion judoman at his university where he was preparing himself to be a marine biologist , as well as having been the school 's best swimmer . Anyway , they ca n't get all of us , he thought loyally , but meaning principally himself , and made his decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get ' em ! " he yelled and leaped to his feet motioning the platoon forward . He took two steps , the platoon with their bayonets fixed since early morning right behind him , and fell down dead , stitched diagonally from hip to shoulder by bullets , one of which exploded his heart . He had just time enough to think that something had hurt him terribly , not even enough to think that he was dead , before he was . Perhaps he screamed . Five others of his platoon went down with him almost simultaneously , in various states of disrepair , some dead , some only nicked . But the impetus Whyte had inaugurated remained , and the platoon charged blindly on . Another impetus would be needed to stop it or change its direction . A few more men went clown . Invisible rifles and machineguns hammered from what seemed to be every quarter of the globe . After reaching the two dead scouts , they came in range of the more distant left ridge , which took them with a heavy crossfire . Sergeant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and who had only been promoted two days before after the defection of Stack , watched the platoon sergeant , a man named  | Grove , throw his rifle from him as though he feared it , and go down hollering and clawing at his chest . Queen did not even think about it . Near him Pfc Doll ran too , blinking his eyes rapidly as though this might protect him . His mind had withdrawn completely in terror , and he did not think at all . Doll 's sense of personal invulnerability was having a severe test , but had not as yet , like Whyte 's , failed . They were past the dead scouts now . More men on the left were beginning to go down . And behind them over the top of the third fold , suddenly , came the 2d Platoon in full career , yelling hoarsely . This was the responsibility of 2d Lt Blane . It was not a particularly complex responsibility . It had nothing to do with envy , jealousy , paranoia , or suppressed self-destruction . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he had promised Bill Whyte he would back him up and help him out . He too knew the corps commander was watching , and he too wanted to do well today . Not as athletic as his fellow worker , but more imaginative , more sensitive , he too leaped up and motioned his men forward , when he saw 1st Platoon move . He could see the whole thing finished in his imagination : himself and Whyte and their men standing atop the bombed out bunkers in proper triumph , the position captured . Ile too died on the forward slope but not at the crest like Whyte . It took several seconds for the still-hidden Japanese gunners to raise their fire , and 2d Platoon was ten yards clown the gentle little slope before it was unleashed against them . Nine men fell at once . Two died and one of them was Blane . Not touched by a machinegun , he unluckily was chosen as target by three separate riflemen , none of whom knew about the others or that he was an officer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yards forward , and with three bullets through his chest cavity did not die right away . He lay on his back and , dreamily and quite numb , stared at the high , beautiful , pure white cumuli which sailed like stately ships across the sunny , cool blue tropic sky . It hurt him a little when he breathed . He was dimly aware that he might possibly die as he became unconscious . 2d Platoon had just reached the two dead 1st Platoon scouts when mortar shells began to drop in onto the 1st Platoon twenty-five yards ahead . First two , then a single , then three together popped up in  | unbelievable mushrooms of dirt and stones . Chards and pieces whickered and whirred in the air . It was the impetus needed either to change the direction of the blind charge or to stop it completely . It did both . In the 2d Platoon S/Sgt Keck , watched by everyone now with Lt Blane down , threw out his arms holding his rifle at the balance , dug in his heels and bellowed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to " Hit dirt ! Hit dirt ! " 2d Platoon needed no urging . Running men melted into the earth as if a strong wind had cone up and blown them over like dried stalks . In the 1st Platoon , less lucky , reaction varied . On the extreme right the line had reached the first beginning slope of the righthand ridge , long hillock really , and a few men  --  perhaps a squad  --  turned and dove into the waisthigh grass there , defilading themselves from the hidden MGs above them as well as protecting them from the mortars . On the far left that end had much further to go , seventy yards more , to reach dead space under the lefthand ridge ; but a group of men tried to make it . None of them reached it , however . They were hosed to earth and hiding by the machineguns above them , or bowled over stunned by the mortars , before they could defilade themselves from the MGs or get close enough to them to escape the mortars . Just to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Culp 's platoon , allowed to join the charge by Whyte through forgetfulness or for some obscure tactical reason of his own , all five of whom , running together , were knocked down by the same mortar shell , gun and tripod and ammo boxes all going every which way and bouncing end over end , although not one of the five was wounded by it . These marked the furthest point of advance . On the extreme left five or six riflemen were able to take refuge in a brushy draw at the foot of Hill 209 which , a little further down , became the deep ravine where Fox and George had been trapped and hit yesterday . These men began to fire at the two grassy ridges although they could sec no targets . In the center of 1st Platoon 's line there were no defilades or draws to run to . The middle , before the mortars stopped them , had run itself right on down and out onto the dangerous low area , where they could not only be enfiladed by the ridges but could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself . Here there was nothing to do  | but get down and hunt holes . Fortunately the TOT barrage had searched here as well as on the hillocks , and there were 105 and 155 holes available . Men jostled each other for them , shared them . The late Lt Whyte 's 19th Century charge was over . The mortar rounds continued to drop here and there across the area , searching flesh , searching bone . Private John Bell of the 2d Platoon lay sprawled exactly as his body had skidded to a halt , without moving a muscle . He could not see because his eyes were shut , but he listened . On the little ridges the prolonged yammering of the MGs had stopped and now confined itself to short bursts at specific targets . Here and there wounded men bellowed , whined or whimpered . Bell 's face was turned left , his cheek pressed to the ground , and he tried not even to breath too conspicuously for fear of calling attention to himself . Cautiously he opened his eyes , half afraid the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred yards away , and found himself staring into the open eyes of the 1st Platoon 's first scout lying dead five yards to Bell 's left . This was , or had been , a young Graec:oTurkish draftee named Kral . Kral was noted for two things , the ugliest bentnosed face in the regiment and the thickest glasses in C-for-Charlie . That with such a myopia he could be a scout was a joke of the company . But Kral had volunteered for it ; he wanted to be where the action was , he said ; in peace or in war . A hep kid from Jersey , he had nevertheless believed the four-color propaganda leaflets . He had not known that the profession of first scout of a rifle platoon was a thing of the past and belonged in the Indian Wars , not to the massed divisions , superior firepower , and tighter social control of today . First target , the term should be , not first scout , and now the big glasses still reposed on his face . They had not fallen off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where Bell lay , magnified the open eyes until they filled the entire lenses . Bell could not help staring fixedly at them , and they stared back with a vastly wise and tolerant amusement . The more Bell stared at them the more he felt them to be holes into the center of the universe and that he might fall in through them to go drifting down through starry space amongst galaxies and spiral nebulae and island universes . He remembered he used to think of his wife 's cunt like that , in a more  | pleasant way . Forcibly Bell shut his eyes . But he was afraid to move his head , and whenever he opened them again , there Kral 's eyes were , staring at him their droll and flaccid message of amiable good will , sucking at him dizzyingly . And wherever he looked they followed him , pleasantly but stubbornly . From above , invisible but there , the fiery sun heat of the tropic clay heated his head inside his helmet , making his soul limp . Bell had never known such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another mortar shell exploded . But in general the day seemed to have become very quiet . His arm with his watch on it lay within his range of vision , he noticed . My God ! Was it only 7:45 ? Defeatedly he let his eyes go back where they wanted : to Kral 's . HERE LIES FOUR-EYES KRAL , DIED FOR SOMETHING . When one of Kral 's huge eyes winked at him waggishly , he knew in desperation he had to do something , although he had been lying there only thirty seconds . Without moving , his cheek still pressed to earth , he yelled loudly . " Hey , Keck ! " He waited . " Hey , Keck ! We got to get out of here ! " " I know it , " came the muffled answer . Keck was obviously lying with his head turned the other way and had no intention of moving it . " What 'll we do ? " " Well . . . " There was silence while Keck thought . It was interrupted by a high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We know you there , Yank . Yank , we know you there . " " Tojo cats shit ! " Keck yelled . He was answered by an angry burst of machinegun fire . " Roozover ' cat shit ! " the faraway voice screamed . " You goddam right he does ! " some frightened Republican called from Bell 's blind right side . When the firing stopped , Bell called again . " What 'll we do , Keck ? " " Listen , " came the muffled answer. , " All you guys listen . Pass it along so everybody knows . " He waited and there was a muffled chorus " Now get this . When I holler go , everybody up . Load and lock and have a nuther clip in yore hand . 1st and 3d Squads stay put , kneeling position , and fire covering fire . 2d and 4th Squads hightail it back  | over that little fold . ist and 3d Squads fire two clips , then scoot. 2d and 4th fire covering fire from that fold . If you ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shots . Them positions is somewhere about half way up them ridges . Everybody fire at the righthand ridge which is closer . You got that ? " He waited while everyone muffledly tried to assure themselves that everybody else knew . " Everybody got it ? " Keck called muffledly . There were no answers . " Then  --  GO ! " he bellowed . The slope came to life . Bell , in the 2d Squad , did not even bother with the brave man 's formality of looking about to see if the plan was working , but instead squirmed around and leaped up running , his legs already pistoning before the leap came down to earth . Safe beyond the little fold of ground , which by now had taken on characteristics of huge size , he whirled and began to fire cover , terribly afraid of being stitched across the chest like Lt Whyte who lay only a few yards away . Methodically he drilled his shots into the dun hillside which still hid the invisible , yammering MGs , one round to the right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the left ... i-Ie could not believe that any of them might actually hit somebody . If one did , what a nowhere way to go : killed by accident ; slain not as an individual but by sheer statistical probability , by the calculated chance of searching fire , even as he himelf might be at any moment . Mathematics ! Mathematics ! Algebra ! Geometry ! When 1st and 3d Squads came diving and tumbling back over the tiny crest , Bell was content to throw himself prone , press his cheek to the earth , shut his eyes , and lie there . God , oh , God ! Why am I here ? Why am I here ? After a moment 's thought , he decided he better change it to : why are we here . That way , no agency of retribution could exact payment from him for being selfish . Apparently Keck 's plan had worked very well . 2d and 4th Squads , having the surprise , had gotten back untouched ; and ist and 3d Squads had had only two men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Running hard with his head down , the man ( a boy , named Kline ) had jerked his head up suddenly , his eyes wide with start and fright , and cried out " Oh ! " , his mouth a round pursed hole in his face , and had gone down . Sick at himself for it , Bell had felt  | laughter burbling up in his chest . He did not know whether Kline was killed or wounded . The MGs had stopped yammering . Now , in the comparative quiet and fifty yards to their front , 1st Platoon was down and invisible amongst their shell holes and sparse grass . Anguished , frightened cries of " Medic ! Medic ! " were beginning to be raised now here and there across the field , and 2d Platoon having escaped were slowly realizing that they were not after all very safe even here . Back at the CP behind the first fold Stein was not alone in seeing the tumbling , pellnmell return of the 2d Platoon to the third fold . Seeing that their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pumped full of holes or mangled , others were now doing it . He was setting them a pretty good example , Stein thought , still a little astonished by his own bravery . They were going to need medics up there , he decided , and called his two company aidmen to him . " You two fellows better get on up there , " Stein yelled to them above the racket . " I expect they need you . " That sounded calm and good . " Yes , sir , " one of them said . That was the scholarly , bespectacled one , the senior . They looked at each other seriously . " I 'll try to get stretcherbearers to the low between here and the second fold , to help you , " Stein shouted . " See if you ca n't drag them back that far . " He stood up on his knees again to peer forward , at where now and then single mortar shells geysered here and there beyond the third fold . " Go by rushes if you think you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I need a runner . " Stein bawled , looking toward the line of his men who had had both the sense and the courage to climb to their knees in order to see . All of them heard him , because the whole little line rolled their eyes to look at him or turned toward him their heads . But not a single figure moved to come forward or answered him . Stein stared back at them , disbelieving . He was aware he had misjudged them completely , and he felt like a damned fool . He had expected to be swamped by volunteers . A sinking terror took hold of him : if he could be that wrong about this , what else might he not be wrong about ? His enthusiasm had betrayed him . To save face he looked away , trying to pretend he had not expected any-  | thing . But it was n't soon enough and he knew they knew . Not quite sure what to do next , he was saved the trouble of deciding : a wraithlike , ghostly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sir . " It was Charlie Dale the second cook , scowling with intensity , his face dark and excited . Stein told him what he wanted about the stretcherbearers , and then watched him go trotting off bent over at the waist toward the slope of Hill 209 which he would have to climb . Stein had no idea where he had been , or where he had come from so suddenly . He could not remember seeing him all day today until now . Certainly he had not been one of the line of kneeling standees . Stein looked back at them , somewhat restored . Dale . He must remember that . There were now twelve men standing on their knees along the little fold of ground , trying to see what was going on up front . Young Corporal Fife was not , however , one of these . Fife was one of the ones who stayed flattened out , and he was as absolutely flattened as he could get . While Stein stood above him on his knees observing , Fife lay with his knees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had given him care of , and he did not care if he never stood up or ever saw anything . Earlier , when Stein had first done it with his stupid pleased pride shining all over his face , Fife had forced himself to stand straight up on his knees for several seconds , in order that no one might tag him with the title of coward . But he felt that was enough . Anyway , his curiosity was not at all piqued . All he had seen , when he did get up , was the top two feet of a dirt mushroom from a mortar shell landing beyond the third fold . What the fuck was so great about that ? Suddenly a spasm of utter hopelessness shook Fife . Helplessness , that was what he felt ; complete helplessness . He was as helpless as if agents of his government had bound him hand and foot and delivered him here and then gone back to wherever it was good agents went . Maybe a Washington cocktail bar , with lots of cunts all around . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own mental processes and social indoctrination as if they were ropes , simply because while he could admit to himself privately that he was a coward , he did not have the guts to admit it publicly . It was agonizing . He was reacting exactly  | as the smarter minds of his society had anticipated he would react . They were ahead of him all down the line . And he was powerless to change . It was frustrating , maddening , like a brick wall all around him that he could neither bust through nor leap over and at the same time  --  making it even worse  --  there was his knowledge that there was really no wall at all . If early this morning he had been full of self-sacrifice , he now no longer was . he did not want to be here . He did not want to be here at all . Iie wanted to be over there where the generals were standing up on the ridge in complete safety , watching . Sweating with fear and an unbelievable tension of doublemindedness , Fife looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would all have fallen down dead and the campaign would be over until they shipped in some new ones . If only he could go crazy . Then he would not be responsible . Why could n't he go crazy ? But he could n't . The un-stone of the stone wall immediately rose up around him denying him exit . He could only lie here and be stretched apart on this rack of double-mindedness . Off to the right , some yards beyond the last man of the reserve platoon , Fife 's eyes recorded for him the images of Sergeants Welsh and Storm crouched behind a small rock outcrop . As he watched , Storm raised his arm and pointed . Welsh snaked his rifle onto the top of the rock and checking the stock , fired off five shots . Both peered . Then they looked at each other and shrugged . It was an easily understood little pantomime . Fife fell into an intense rage . Cowboys and Indians ! Cowboys and Indians ! Everybody 's playing cowboys and Indians ! Just as if these were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed . Fife 's head burned with a fury so intense that it threatened to blow all his mental fuses right out through his cars in two bursts of black smoke . His rage was broken off short , snapped off at the hilt as it were , by the buzzing whistle of the soundpower phone in his ear . Startled , Fife cleared his throat , shocked into wondering whether he could still talk , after so long . It was time first time he had tried a word since leaving the ridge . It was also the first time he had ever heard this damn phone thing work . He pushed the button and cupped it to his mouth . " Yes ? " he said cautiously . " What do you mean , yes ' ? " a calm cold voice said , and waited . Fife hung suspended in a great empty black void , trying to think .  | What had he meant ? " I mean this is Charlie Cat Seven , " he said , remembering the code jargon . " Over . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is Seven Cat Ace . " That meant 1st Battalion , the HQ . " Colonel Tall here . I want Captain Stein . Over . " " Yes , Sir , " Fife said . " He 's right here . " He reached up one arm to tug at the skirt of Stein 's green fatigue blouse . Stein looked down , staring , as if he had never seen Fife before . Or anybody else . " Colonel Tall wants you . " Stein lay down ( glad to flatten himself , Fife noted with satisfaction ) and took the phone . Despite the racketing din overhead , both he and Fife beside him could hear the Colonel clearly . When he accepted the phone and pushed down the button , Bugger Stein was already casting about for his explanations . He had not expected to be called upon to recite so soon , and he had not prepared his lessons . What he could say would of course depend on Tall 's willingness to allow any explanation at all . He could not help being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cat Seven . Stein , " he said . " Over . " IIe released the button . What he heard astounded him to speechlessness . " Magnificent , Stein , magnificent . " Tall 's clear cold calm boyish voice came to him  --  came to both of them  --  rimed over with a crust of clear cold boyish enthusiasm . " The finest thing these old eyes have seen in a long time . In a month of Sundays . " Stein had a vivid mental picture of Tall 's closecropped , boyish , Anglo-Saxon head and unlined , Anglo-Saxon face . Tall was less than two years older than Stein . His clear , innocent , boyish eyes were the youngest Stein had seen in some time . " Beautifully conceived and beautifully executed . You 'll be mentioned in Battalion Orders , Stein . Your men came through for you beautifully . Over . " Stein pressed the button , managed a weak " Yes , Sir . Over , " and released the button . He could not think of anything else to say . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever seen outside maneuvers . Young Whyte led beautifully . I 'm mentioning him , too . I saw him go down in that first melee . Was he hurt very bad ? But sending in your 2d too was brilliant . They might very well have carried both subsidiary ridges with luck . I do nt  | think they were hurt too bad . Blane led well too . His withdrawal was very old pro . How many of the emplacements did they locate ? Did they knock out any ? We ought to have those ridges cleaned out by noon . Over . " Stein listened , rapt , staring into the eyes of Fife who listened also , staring back . For Fife tote calm , pleasant , conversational tone of Col Tall was both maddening and terrifying . And for Stein it was like hearing a radio report on the fighting in Africa which he knew nothing about . Once in school his father had called him long distance to brag about a good report card which Stein had thought would be bad . Neither listener betrayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lengthened . " Hello ? Hello ? Hello , Stein ? Over ? " Stein pressed the button . " Yes , Sir . Here , Sir . Over " Stein released the button . " Thought you 'd been hit , " Tall 's voice came back matter-offactly . " I said , how many of the emplacements did they locate ? And did they knock any of them out ? Over . " Stein pressed the button , staring into the wide eyes of Fife as if he might see Tall on the other side of them . " I do nt know . Over . " He released the button . " What do you mean you do nt know ? How can you not know ? " Tall 's cool , calm , conversational voice said . " Over . " Stein was in a quandary . He could admit what both he and Fife knew , or perhaps Fife did not know , which was that lie knew nothing about Whyte 's attack , had not ordered it , and until now had believed it bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and try to explain his ignorance of its results . Ile could not , of course , know that Tall would later change his opinion . With a delicacy of sensibility Stein had never expected to see at all in the army , and certainly not on the field under fire , Fife suddenly lowered his eyes and looked away , half turned his head . He was still listening , but at least he was pretending not to . Stein pressed the button , which was a necessity , but which was beginning to madden him . " I 'm back here , " he said sharply . " Behind the third fold .  | " Do you want me to stand up ? And wave ? So you can see me ? " he added with caustic anger . " Over . " " No , " Tall 's voice said calmly , the irony lost on him . " I can see where you are . I want you to do something . I want you to get up there and see what the situation is , Stein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And to do that I have to have those two ridges by noon . Have you forgotten the corps commander is here observing today ? He 's got Admiral Barr with him , flown in specially . The Admiral got up at dawn for this . I want you to come to life down there , Stein , " he said crisply . " Over and out . " Stein continued to listen , gripping the phone and staring off furiously , though he knew nothing more was forthcoming . Finally he reached out and tapped Fife and gave it to him . Fife took it in silence . Stein rolled to his feet and ran crouching back down to where the mortars were periodically firing off rounds with their weird , other-world , lingering gonglike sound . " Doing any good ? " he bellowed in Culp 's ear . " We 're getting bursts on both ridges , " Culp bellowed back in his amiable way . " I decided to put one tube onto the right ridge , " he said parenthetically , and then shrugged . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damage . If they 're dug in ? " He let it trail off and shrugged again . " I 've decided to move forward to the second fold , " Stein yelled . " Will that be too close for you ? " Culp strode three paces forward up the shallow slope and craned his neck to see over the crest , squinting . He came back . " No . It 's pretty close , but I think we can still hit . But we 're runnin pretty low on ammo . If we keep on firing at this rate ? " Again he shrugged . " Send everybody but your sergeants back for fresh ammo . All they can carry . Then follow us . " " They do nt any of them like to carry them aprons , " Culp yelled . " They all say if they get hit with one of those things on them ... " " God damn it , Bob ! I ca n't be bothered with a thing like that at a time like this ! They knew what they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " Culp shrugged . " Where do you want me ? " Stein thought . " On the right , I guess . If they locate you , they 'll  | try to hit you . I want you away from the reserve platoon . I 'll give you a few riflemen in case they try to send a patrol in on our flank . Anything that looks like more than a patrol , you let me know quick . " " Do nt worry ! " Culp said . He turned to his squads . Stein trotted off to the right , where he had seen Al Gore , Lt of his 3d Platoon , motioning at the same time for Sgt Welsh to come over to him . Welsh came , followed by Storm , for the orders conference . Even Welsh , Stein noticed parenthetically , even Welsh had that strained , intent , withdrawn look on his face  --  like a greasy patina of guilty wishful thinking . While 3d Platoon and Stein 's Company HQ were trooping forward in two parallel single files in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued to lie in its shellholes . After the first crash and volley and thunder of mortars they all had expected to be dead in five minutes . Now , it seemed unbelievable but the Japanese did not seem to be able to see them very well . Now and then a bullet or a burst zipped by low overhead , followed in a second or so by the sound of its firing . Mortar rounds still sighed down on them , exploding with roaring mushrooms of terror and dirt . But in general the Japanese seemed to be waiting for something . 1st Platoon was willing to wait with them . Leaderless , pinned down , pressing its hands and sweating faces to the dirt , 1st Platoon was willing to wait forever and never move again . Many prayed and promised God they would go to church services every Sunday . But slowly , they began to realize that they could move around , could fire back , that death was not a foregone conclusion and inevitable for all . The medics helped with this . The two company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up amongst 2d Platoon along the third fold , and had begun little sorties out onto the shallow slope after wounded . In all there were 15 wounded men , and 6 dead . The two aidmen did not bother with the dead , but slowly they retrieved for the stretcherbearers all of the wounded . ' With insouciance , sober , serious and bespectacled , the two of them moved up and down the slope , bandaging and salting , dragging and halfcarrying . Mortar shells knocked them down , MG fire kicked up dirt around them , but nothing touched them . Both would be dead  | before the week was out ( and replaced by types much less admired in C-for-Charlie ) , but for now they clumped untouchably on , two sobersides concerned with aiding the sobbing , near-helpless men it was their official duty to aid . Eventually enough 1st Platoon men raised their heads high enough to see them , and realized movement was possible  --  at least , as long as they did not all stand up in a body and wave and shout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had as yet seen a single Japanese . It was Doll who saw the first ones . Sensing the movement around him as men began to stir and call softly to each other , Doll took his bruised confidence in hand and raised his head until his eyes showed above the slight depression into which he had sprawled . He happened to come up looking at the rear of the little lefthand ridge , just where it joined the rocky rim slope up to Hill 210 . He saw three figures carrying what could only be a machinegun still attached to its tripod start across the slope back toward I-Iill 210 , running bent over at the waist in the same identical way he himself had run up here . Doll was astounded and did not believe it . They were about two hundred yards away , and the two men behind ran together carrying the gun , while the man in front siinl ) ly ran , carrying nothing . Doll slid his rifle up , raised the sight four clicks and , lying with only his left arm and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front , leading him a little , and squeezed off a shot . The rifle bucked his shoulder and the man went down . The two men behind jumped sideways together , like a pair of skittish , delicately coordinated horses , and ran on . They did not drop the gun , and they did not lose a stride or even get out of step . Doll fired again and missed . He realized his mistake now : if he had hit one of the men with the MG , they 'd have had to drop it and leave it or else stop to pick it up . Before he could fire a third time they were in among the rocks on the rim , beyond which the steep precipice fell to the river . Doll could see their backs or heads from time to time as they went on , but never long enough to shoot . The other man remained where he had fallen on the slope . So Doll had killed his first Japanese . For that matter , his first human being of any kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could remember his first deer . But this was an experience which required  | extra tasting . Like getting screwed the first time , it was too complex to be classed solely as pride of accomplishment . Shooting well , at anything , was always a pleasure . And Doll hated the Japanese , dirty little yellow Jap bastards , and would gladly have killed personally every one of them alive if the US Army and Navy would only arrange him a safe opportunity and supply him the ammo . But beyond these two pleasures there was another . It had to do with guilt . Doll felt guilty . He could n't help it . He had killed a human being , a man . He had done the most horrible thing a human could do , worse than rape even . And nobody in the whole damned world could say anything to him about it . That was where the pleasure came . Nobody could do anything to him for it . He had gotten by with murder . He watched the figure on the slope . He would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had aimed for the chest ) , and whether he died right away , or if he was lying there still alive , dying slowly . Doll felt an impulse to grin a silly grin and to giggle . He felt stupid and cruel and mean and vastly superior . It certainly had helped his confidence anyway , that was for sure . Just then a mortar shell sighed down for a half-second and ten yards away exploded a fountain of terror and dirt , and Doll discovered his confidence had n't been helped so much after all . Before he could think he had jerked himself and his rifle down onto ' ' the floor of his little depression and curled up there , fear running like heavy threads of quicksilver through all his arteries and veins as if they were glass thermometers . After a moment he wanted to raise back up and look again but found that he could n't . What if just as he put up his head another one exploded and a piece of it took him square between the eyes , or knifed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ split his skull ? The prospect was too much . After a while , after his breathing had quieted , he again put his head up to the eye level . This time there were four Japanese preparing to leave the grassy ridge for the uphill road to Hill 210 . They came into sight from somewhere on the ridge already running . Two carried the gun , another carried handled boxes , the fourth had nothing . Doll pulled his rifle up into position and aimed for the gun-carriers . II As the party crossed the open space , he fired four times and missed each time . They disappeared into the rocks .  | Doll was so furious he could have bitten a piece out of his own arm . While cursing himself , he remembered he had now fired six rounds . He released the clip and replaced it with a fresh one , sliding the two unused rounds into his pants pocket , then settled down to wait for more Japanese . Only then did he realize that what he was watching might have more implication and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what to do ? He remembered Big Queen had been running near him when they hit the dirt . " Hey , Queen ! " After a moment , there was a muffled answer . " Yeah ? " " Did you see them Japs leavin that left ridge ? " " I ai nt been seein much of nothin , " Queen called with muffled honesty . " Well , why do nt you get your fuckin head up and look around ? " Doll could not resist the gibe . He suddenly felt very powerful and in command of himself , almost gay . " Go fuck yourself , Doll , " was Queen 's muffled answer . " No , Sarge , " ( he used the title deliberately ) , " I 'm serious . I counted seven Japs leavin that lefthand grassy ridge . I got me one of them , " he added modestly without , however , mentioning how many times he 'd missed . " So ? " " I think they 're pullin out of there . Maybe somebody ought to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one ? " Queen called back with muffled sarcasm . The idea had not occurred to Doll . Now it did . He had already seen the two aidmen moving about on the slope , and apparently nothing had happened to them . He could see them now , simply by turning his head a little . " Why not ? " he called cheerfully . " Sure . I 'll carry the message back to Bugger for you . " Suddenly his heart was beating in his throat . " You 'll do no such a goddam fucking thing , " Queen called . " You 'll stay right the fuck where you are and shut up . That 's an order . " Doll did not answer for a moment . Slowly his heart returned to  | normal . He had offered and been refused . He had committed himself and been freed . But something else was driving him , something he could not put a name to . " Okay , " he called . " They 'll get us out of this in a little bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordering you . " " I said okay , " Doll called . But the thing that was driving him , eating on him , did n't recede . He had a strange tingling all through his belly and crotch . Off to the right there was a sudden burst of the MG fire his ear now knew as Japanese , and immediately after it a cry of pain . " Aidman ! Aidman ! " somebody called . It sounded like Stearns . No , it was n't all that easy . In spite of the two aidmen moving all around . The tingling in Doll got stronger and his heart began to pound again . He had never in his life been excited quite like this . Somebody had to get that news to Bugger . Somebody had to be a  --  hero . He had already killed one man , if you could call a Jap a man . And nobody , not a single soul in the world , could touch him for it , not a single soul . Doll raised his left eyebrow and pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He did not wait for Big Queen , or bother with his permission . When he had squirmed himself around facing the rear , he lay a moment lifting himself to the act , his heart pounding . He could not quite bring himself to begin to move . But he knew he would . There was something else in it , also . In what it was that was driving , pulling him to do it . It was like facing God . Or gambling with Luck . It was taking a dare from the Universe . It excited him more than all the hunting , gambling and fucking he had ever done all rolled together . When he went , he was up in a flash and running , not at full speed , but at about half speed which was better controlled , bent over , his rifle in both hands , even as the Japanese he himself had downed . A bullet kicked up dirt two feet to his left and he zigged right . Ten yards further on lie zagged left . Then he was over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him uncomprehendingly . Doll giggled . He found Capt Bugger Stein behind the second fold where he had just arrived , ran almost headon into him in fact and did not even have to hunt . He was hardly even winded. 1st Sgt Welsh was crouching with Stein and Band behind the  | crest of the second fold , when Doll came trotting up , bent over , giggling and laughing , so out of breath he could not talk . Welsh , who had always disliked Doll for a punk , and still did , thought he looked like a young recruit coming giggling out of a whorehouse after the first real fuck of his life , and he eyed him narrowly , wanting to know why . " What the hell are you laughing at ? " Stein snapped . " At the way I fooled them yellow bastards shooting at me , " Doll gasped , giggling , but soon subsided before Stein 's gaze . Welsh , with the others , listened to his story of the seven Japanese and two guns he had seen leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely out of there , sir . " " Who sent you back here ? " Stein said . " Nobody , sir . I came myself . I thought it was something you 'd want to know . " " You were right . It is . " Stein nodded his head sternly . Welsh , watching him from where he crouched , wanted to spit . Bugger was acting very much the company commander , today . " And I wo n't forget it , Doll . " Doll did not answer , but he grinned . Stein , on one knee , was now rubbing his unshaven chin and blinking his eyes behind his glasses . Doll was still standing straight up . " God damn it , get down , " Stein said irritably . Doll looked around leisurely , then consented to squat , since it was obviously an order . " George , " Stein said , " get a man with glasses and have him spot the back of that ridge . I want to know the second anybody leaves it . Here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine . " " I 'll do it myself , " Band said , and bared his teeth in a brillianteyed , weird smile . He took off . Stein looked after him a long moment , and Welsh wanted to laugh . Stein turned back to Doll and began to question him about the attack , casualties , the present position and state of the platoon . Doll did n't really know very much . He had seen Lt Whyte die , knew Sgt Grove was down but not whether he was dead . He had  --  they all had , he amended  --  been pretty busy when the first big bunch of mortars began to hit . He thought he had seen a group of about  | squad size go into the deep grass at the base of the right ridge , but was n't sure . And he had seen the machinegun squad run far out ahead and all go down together with one mortar burst . Stein cursed at this , and demanded what they were doing there in the first place . Doll of course did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their U.S.-made shellholcs and depressions in the bottom , were safe enough for the moment , provided the Japs did not lay a heavy mortar barrage on them . No , he himself had not been very scared the whole time . He did n't know why , really . Welsh hardly listened to them . He was looking over the crest at the 2d Platoon flattened out in a long line behind the crest of the third fold , and thinking his own thoughts . 2d Platoon was as flattened as it could get , cheeks and bellies pressed tight to the earth , faces scarred with the white of staring eyeballs and bared teeth , all looking back this way , watching for their Commander , who conceivably might order them to go over this crest again . 2d Platoon would make a great photograph to send back home , Welsh 's eyes told him  --  without in the least disturbing his thinking  --  except that of course when the newspapers , government , army , and Life got ahold of it , it would be subtly changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : TIRED INFANTRYMEN REST IN SAFETY AFTER HEROIC CAPTURE OF POSITION . THE FIRST TEAM AT HALFTIME . BUY BONDS TILL IT HURTS YOUR ASSHOLE . But all of this more or less visual thinking had nothing to do with what Welsh was thinking on another , deeper level . Mostly , he was thinking about himself . He found it satisfying to contemplate the fact that if he got it , got knocked off , the government would n't have anybody to send a Regrets card to for him . He knew how those fuckfaces of government wllitecollar workers loved their jobs and their authority . When he first enlisted , he had given a false first name and middle initial . Ile and his family had not heard from each other since . On the other hand if he only got crippled , maimed , his enemies the government would have to take care of him , since they had no next-of-kin for him . So he had the bureaucracy fucked both ways . His view of 2d Platoon misted over slightly with a vision of himself in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aged man in a wheelchair , with a pint bottle of gin  | hidden in his cheap flimsy robe , cackling and quacking at the weightlifter lesbian Napoleons of nurses , at the pinheaded , pipsqueak , hard-jawed Alexander-the-greats of doctors . He 'd give them a hard time ... . " You 're not really pinned down , then , " he heard Stein say . " I was told ? " " Well , we are , in a way , sir , " Doll said . " But , like you see , I got back all right . We could n't all come back at once . " Stein nodded . " But two or three at a time could make it , I think . With 2d Platoon firing covering fire , " Doll suggested . " We do nt even know where those goddamned fucking emplacements are , " Stein said sourly . " They could fire searching fire , could n't they ? " Doll suggested professionally . Stein glared at him . So did Welsh . Welsh wanted to boot the new hero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? about searching fire , yet . ' Welsh interrupted them . " Hey , Cap'n ! " he growled . " You want me to go down there and get them men back up here for you ? " He glared murderously at Doll , whose eyebrows went up innocently . " No . " Stein rubbed his jaw . " No , I ca n't spare you . Might need you . Anyway , I think I 'll leave them there a while . They do nt seem to be getting hurt too bad and if we can get up onto that right ridge frontally maybe they can flank it . " He paused . " What interests me is that squad on the right that got into the deep grass on the ridge . They ? " He was interrupted by George Band who , bent over , came running down the little slope . " Hey , Jim ! Hey , Captain Stein ! I just saw five more leaving the left ridge , with two MGs . I think they really are pulling out . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He sounded as relieved as if he had just been told the battle had been called off until another time . At least now he could act . " Gore ! Gore ! " he began to bellow . " Lt Gore ! " It required fifteen minutes to summon Gore , instruct him , assemble his 3d Platoon , and see them off on their venture .  | " We 're pretty sure they 're pulling out completely , Gore . But do nt get overeager ; like Whyte . They may have left a rearguard . Or maybe it 's a trap . So go slow . Let your scouts look it over first . I think your best approach is down the draw in front of Hill 209 . Go left behind this middle fold here till it hits the draw , and then down the draw . If you get hit by mortars like they did there yesterday , you got to keep going , though . If there 's a waterhole in that brush at the loot of the ridge , let me know about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already . But the main thing . The main thing , Gore , is not to lose any more men than you absolutely have to . " It was becoming an increasingly important point to Stein , almost frantically so . And whenever he was not actually occupied with something specific , that was what he brooded over . " Now , go ahead , boy ; and good luck . " Men ; men ; he was losing all his men ; men he had lived with ; men he was responsible for . It required another half hour for Gore 's reserve 3d Platoon to reach its jumpoff point at the foot of the grassy ridge . He was certainly following orders and going slow , Stein thought with impatience . It was now after 9:00 . In the meantime Band had come back from the crest of the fold with a report that he had counted three more small bodies of men leaving the left ridge with MGs , but had counted none in the last fifteen minutes . Also in the meantime little Charlie Dale the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and at the same time dark and thunderous . He showed Stein where he had brought the stretcher bearers to the low between the first and middle folds , four parties of four , sixteen men in all , who were already starting to collect the first of the eight litter cases which had by now accumulated . Then he asked if there were any more little jobs for him to do . Corporal Fife , lying not far flow the Company Commander with the sound power phone which had more or less become his permanent responsibility , thought he had never seen such an unholy look on a human face . Perhaps Fife was a little jealous because he was so afraid himself . Certainly there was n't any fear in Charlie Dale . His mouth hung open in a slack little grin , the bright and at the same time lowering eyes darting everywhere and filmed over with an unmistakable sheen of pleased selfsatisfaction at all this attention  | he suddenly was getting . Fife looked at him , then sickly turned his head away and closed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his job ; he 'd been given it and he 'd do it ; but he 'd be damned if he 'd do anything else he was n't told to do . He could n't . He was too afraid . " Yes , " Bugger Stein was saying to Dale . " You ? " He was interrupted by the explosion of a mortar shell amongst the 2d Platoon on the rear slope of the third fold . Its loud thwonging bang was almost simultaneous with a loud scream of pure fear , which after the explosion died away continued until the screamer ran out of breath . A man had thrown himself out of the line back down the slope and was bucking and kicking and rolling with both hands pressed behind him in the small of his back . When he got his breath back , he continued to scream . Everyone else hugged the comforting dirt , which nevertheless was not quite comforting enough , and waited for a barrage to begin to fall . Nothing happened , however , and after a moment they began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who still bucked and screamed . " I do nt think they can see us any better than we can see them , " Welsh muttered , tight-lipped . " I believe that 's Private Jacques , " Lt Band said in an interested voice . The screaming had taken on a new tone , one of realization , rather than the start and surprise and pure fear of before . One of the aidmen got to him and with the help of two men from 2d Platoon tore open his shirt and got a syrette of morphine into him . In a few seconds he quieted . When he was still , the aidman pulled the hands loose and rolled him over . His belt off , his shirt up , he was looked over by the aidman , who then was seen to shrug with despair and reach in his pack and begin to sprinkle . Behind the middle fold Bugger Stein was whitefaced , his lips tight , his eyes snapping open and and shut behind his glasses . This was the first of his men he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same scene with a look of friendly , sympathetic interest on his face . Beyond Band Corporal Fife had raised up once to look while the man was still bucking and kicking and  | then lain back down sick all over ; all he could think of was what if it had been him ? It might easily have been , might still yet be . " Stretcher bearers ! Stretcher bearers ! " Stein had suddenly turned back toward the hollow where two of the four groups had not yet departed with loads . " Stretcher bearers ! " he yelled at the top of his lungs . One of the groups came on the run with their stretcher . " But , Jim , " Lt Band said . " Really , Jim , I do nt ? " " God damn you , George , shut up ! Leave me alone ! " The bearers arrived out of breath . " Go get that man , " Stein said pointing over the crest to where the aidman still knelt by the casualty . The leader plainly had thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now he saw his mistake . " But listen , " he protested , " we already got eight or nine down there now that we 're supposed to ? We 're not ? " " God damn it , do n't argue with me ! I 'm Captain Stein ! Go get that man , I said ! " Stein bawled in his face . The man recoiled , upset . Of course nobody was wearing insignia . " But , Jim , really , " Brass Band said , " he 's not ? " " God damn you , all of you ! Am I in command around here or not ! " Stein was in a howling rage ; and he was actually almost howling . " Am I Company Commander of this outfit or am I not ! Am I Captain Stein or a goddamned private ! Do I give the orders here or do nt I ! I said go get that man ! " " Yes , sir , " the leader said . " Okay , sir . Right away . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He 's hit bad . Get him back to battalion aid station and see if they ca n't do something to save him . " " Yes , sir , " the leader of the bearers said . He spread his hands palms up toward Stein absolving himself of guilt . " We got others that 're hit bad , sir . ' ! ' hat was all I meant . We got three down there might die any minute . " Stein stared at hint uncomprehendingly . " That 's it , Jim , " Band said from behind him soothingly . " Do nt you see ? Do nt you think he ought to wait his turn ? Is n't that only fair ? " " Wait his turn ? Wait his turn ? Fair ? My God ! " Stein said . He stared at both of them , his face white .  | " Sure , " Band said . " Why put him ahead of some other guy ? " Stein did not answer him . After a moment he turned to the leader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stiffly , " like I told you . Get him back to battalion aid station . I gave you an order , Private . " " Yes , sir . " The leader 's voice was stony . He turned to his men . " Come on , you guys . We 're goin over there after that guy . " " Well what the hell 're we waitin for ? " one of them snarled toughly . " Come on , Hoke . Or are you afraid of gettin that close to the shooting ? " It was a ridiculous remark under the circumstances . The leader plainly was n't afraid of going . " You shut up , Witt , " he said , " and let me alone . " All of them were squatting . The man he had addressed stood up suddenly . He was a small , frail-looking man , and the US helmet shell , which on Big Queen looked so small , looked like an enormous inverted pot on his small head and almost hid his eyes . He marched up to where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't , " the small man said with a rapacious grin . Only then did Stein , or any of the rest of the C-for-Charlie men for that matter , recognize that this Witt was their Witt , the same that Stein and Welsh had combined to transfer out before the division left for combat . All of them were astonished , as Witt obviously meant for them to be . Corporal Fife especially . Fife , still lying flat with the phone to his ear , sat up suddenly , grinning . " By God ! Hello , Witt ! " he cried delightedly . Witt , true to his promise of a few days before , passed his narrow eyes across the Corporal as if he did not exist . They came to rest on Welsh , again . " Hi , Witt , " Welsh said . " You in the medics now ? You better get down . " Stein , who had felt guilty for having transferred Witt when he knew how badly Witt wanted to stay , even though he still felt he had done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Witt ignored Welsh 's cautioning . He remained standing straight up . " Naw , Firs ' Sar n't , " he grinned . " Still in Cannon Comp'ny . Only , as you know , we ai nt got no cannons . So they 've put us to work pushin boats up and down the river and as stretcher bearers . " He inclined his head . " Who we goin after over there , Firs ' Sar n't ? "  | " Jacques , " Welsh said . " Old Jockey ? " Witt said . " Shit , that 's too bad . " His three companions had already gone on and were now running downhill beyond the crest of the fold and Witt turned to follow them . But then he turned back and spoke directly to Bugger Stein . " Please , sir , can I come back to the compny ? After we get Jockey back to battalion ? I can slip away easy . They 'll give Hoke another man . Can I , sir ? " Stein was flattered . He was also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jacques was getting out of hand , taking too much of his attention from the plan he had been just about to conceive . " Well , I ? " he said and stopped , his mind blank . " Of course , you 'll have to get someone 's permission . " Witt grinned cynically . " Sure , " he said . " And my rifle . Thank you , sir . " He turned and was gone , after his mates . Stein tried to reorganize the scattered threads of his thought . For a moment he stared after Witt . For a man to want to come back into a forward rifle company in the midst of an attack was simply incomprehensible to him . In a way , though , it was very romantic . Like something out of Kipling . Or Beau Geste . Now , what was it that he had just about had figured out ? Close to Stein , as Bugger 's orders about the phone demanded he be , Corporal Fife had lain back down flat with his phone and shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gesture of ignoring him had to do with their argument of a few days back , he could not help taking it as contempt and disgust for his present cowardice ? as if Witt with one glance had looked inside his mind . When he reopened his eyes , he found himself looking into the white face of little Bead a few feet away , eyes popeyed with fright , blinking almost audibly , like some overgrown rabbit . " Dale ! " Bugger called . " Now , look , " he said , marshaling his mind . Charlie Dale crawled closer . When he first returned from his mission , he had made himself stand upright quite a while , but when the mortar shell exploded wounding Jacques , he had flattened himself . Now he compromised by squatting . Bugger had been just about to tell him something , perhaps send him on another mission , when Jacques got hit and then the stretcher bearers came . Dale could not help feeling a little piqued . Not at Jacques of course . He could n't  | be mad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a better time to get shot up . But those goddam stretcher bearers from Cannon Compny and that goddam bolshevik Witt , they certainly could have taken less of the Compny Cmander 's valuable time . Especially when he was about to tell Pfc Dale something very important maybe . For Dale this was the first chance that he had had in a long time for talking to the Compny Cmander personally like this , for being free of that goddam order-giving Storm and his cheating cooks , first chance to not be tied to that goddam greasy sweating kitchen cooking masses of food for a bunch of men to gorge their guts on , and Dale was enjoying it . He was getting more personal attention than he had ever had from this outfit , at last they were beginning to recognize him , and all he had to do for it was carry a few messages through some light MG fire that could n't hit him anyway . Gravy . Not far off he could see fucking Storm lying all flattened out beside Sgt Welsh , and looking this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face and listened to his commander intently . An inarticulate , secret excitement burgeoned in him . " I 've got to know how 3 ( 1 Platoon is doing , " Bugger was telling him . " I want you to go and find out for me . " He described the position and told him how to get there . " Report to Lt Gore if you can find him . But I 've got to know if they occupied that grassy ridge , and I 've got to know as soon as possible . Get back as soon as you can . " " Aye , aye , sir , " Dale said , his eyes pleased . " I want both you and Doll to stay with me , " Bugger said . " I 'll have further work for both of you . You 've both been invaluable . " " Yes , sir , " Dale smiled . Then , unsmiling , he looked over at Doll , and found Doll to be studying him equally . " Now , go ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little salute and took off , running bent over along the low area behind the fold , his rifle slung across his back , his Thompsongun in his hands . He did not have to go far . At the corner where the hollow met the draw in front of Hill 209 , he met a man from 3d Platoon already on his way back with the news that 3d Platoon had occupied the lefthand  | grassy ridge without firing a shot and were now digging themselves in there . Together they returned to Stein , Dale feeling a little cheated . Stein had not waited for Dale 's return . Gradually his plan had shaped itself in his mind , even while he was talking to Dale . Whether 3d Platoon had occupied the lefthand ridge made little difference to it . They could provide more covering fire , and that would help , but it was not essential , because this movement had to do with the squad-size group of 1st Platoon men who had made it in under the machineguns , into the thicker grass at the foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to be the trouble spot , the stumbling block . With the squad-sized group already there plus two more squads from 2d Platoon Stein wanted to make a sort of double-winged uphill frontal attack whose center would hold and whose ends would curl around and isolate the main strongpoint on the ridge , wherever it was . The remainder of 2d Platoon could fire cover from the third fold , and Stein thought the rest of 1st Platoon  --  the remnants , he amended sourly ? could fire cover along the flank from their advanced position in their holes . With this in mind he had already , after Charlie Dale 's departure , sent Doll back down into that inferno beyond the third fold , now temporarily quiet , where 1st Platoon still dung precariously to the dirt of their holes , sweating . Doll had only just left when the stretcher bearers came back with Jacques . Stein found he could not resist the desire to look at him . Neither could anybody else . They had laid him on his stomach on the stretcher . The aidman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was apparent that there was a long glancing hole in the small of Jacques 's back . His face hung over the side of die stretcher , and his half-closed eyes , dulled of intelligence by the morphine and by shock , held only a peculiar questioning look . 1Ie appeared to be asking them , or somebody , why ? ? why he , John Jacques , ASN so-and-so , had been chosen for this particular fate ? Somewhere a stranger had dropped a metal case down a tube , not knowing exactly where it would land , not even sure where he wanted it to land . It had gone up and come down . And where did it land ? On John Jacques , ASN so-and-so . When it had burst , thousands of chunks and pieces of knife-edged  | metal had gone chirring in all directions . And who was the only one touched by one of them ? John Jacques , ASN so-and-so . Why ? Why him ? No enemy had aimed anything at John Jacques , ASN so-and-so . No enemy knew that John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knew the name , character and personality of the Japanese who dropped the metal case down the tube . So why ? Why him ? Why John Jacques , ASN so-and-so ? Why not somebody else ? Why not one of his friends ? And now it was done . Soon he would he dead . Stein forced himself to look somewhere else . At the tail , off end of the stretcher he saw Witt , who , being shorter , had to strain more to keep his end up level . Thinking about Doll and 1st Platoon , Stein was just about to send someone after Sgt. Keck , the new commander of 2d Platoon , when Charlie Dale and the messenger returned . Doll had gone back reluctantly . He had not intended , when he first came back , to set himself up as a troubleshooting messenger to dangerous areas for Bugger Stein . Truthfully , lie did not really know why he had done it . And now he was hooked . Also , he was angered at the easiness of Charlie Dale 's mission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damn fool could go back , after stretcher bearers , or even forward when he had a covered route all the way . For himself , he did not know how he was going to accomplish his job . Whyte was dead , Grove dead or badly wounded , and that left the command of the platoon to Skinny Culn , the platoon guide . If he was not hit or dead too . Sgt Culn was a round , redfaced , pugnosed , jovial Irishman of 28 , an old regular who ought to be all right leading the platoon . But Doll had no idea where to find him . The only man whose whereabouts Doll knew was Big Queen . This meant that he would have to hunt , maybe even run from hole to hole , looking , and down there Doll did not relish that idea . He 'd like to see Dale do it . Before going , he lay behind the crest of the third fold amongst the 2d Platoon and raised his head to look down into the low area where he must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the earth , stared at him with indifferent , sullen curiosity . He was aware that his eyes were narrowed , his nostrils flared , his jaw set .  | He made a handsome picture of a soldier for the 2d Platoon men who watched him without liking . Out in front one of the medics was helping back a fat man who had been shot through the calf and was groaning audibly . Doll felt a sort of amused contempt for him ; why could n't he keep his mouth shut ? Once again the sick excitement had taken hold of him and gripped him by the belly , making his crotch tingle and his heart pound and paralyzing his diaphragm so that he breathed slower and slower and slower , and even slower still , until his essence and being ran down and seemed to stop in an entranced totality of concentration . Then he was up and running . He ran bent over and at half speed and exposed to the world , the same way he had run up out of there . Some bullets kicked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zagged . In ten seconds ' time he was back down flat in his little depression already calling breathlessly for Queen and wanting to laugh out loud . He had known all along he 'd make it . A burst of MG fire tickled the rim of his hole and whined away , showering him with dirt . But the getting here was only the beginning . He still had to find Culn . And the muffled information which came to him from Big Queen down in his hole was that Culn was somewhere over on the right ; at least Queen had seen him there before the charge . But when Doll rolled over and called off to his right , the man who should have been , must be somewhere there , did not answer . A great soft lump of fear had risen in Doll 's throat as he talked . He tried now to swallow it , but it remained . This was the situation he had been dreading back at the third fold before taking off . He was going to have to run down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goddam them . He would show them . He 'd do it , do it standing on his head . And then let 's see what that little punk Dale could do . He was Don Doll and nobody was going to kill him in this war . The sons of bitches . Once again that great , strange stillness which he got , and which affected his breathing , came over Doll , blanketing out everything , as he prepared to get up . In his pants his balls tingled acutely . It was exactly the same feeling he used to get as a kid when something like Christmas got him excited . Let 's see their faces and Bugger Stein 's when he came back out of this .  | In the fact , Stein had almost completely forgotten about his messenger to the 1st Platoon . The stress of newer developments claimed him . With the return of Charlie Dale and the good news about 3d Platoon , he decided not to send for Keck but to go to him . There , behind the third fold with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planned and observe it . With this in mind he had sent George Band with Sgt Storm and the cook force back around the covered route to join 3d Platoon . Band was to assume command and be prepared to attack the righthand ridge if Stein 's attack succeeded . Band , with his weird bloodthirsty grin , constant neat advice and cool calm interest in the wounded , had been getting on Stein 's nerves more and more , and this was a good way to get rid of him and at the same time make him useful . Then he put in a call to Col Tall , Battalion Commander . More and more things had been getting on Stein 's nerves , more and more increasingly . In the first place he could never be sure that what he did was right , might n't have been done better and with less cost in some other way . He felt that way about the attack he was preparing to mount now . In addition there was his own nervous fear and apprehension , which kept eating into his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air like a faulty neon tube . Whenever he stood up he might be struck by a bullet . Whenever he moved a few feet he might be moving under a descending mortar shell . Hiding these apprehensions from his men was even more fatiguing . Also , he had already finished off one of his two canteens of water , and was a third through the other , without ever having allayed his thirst . And in addition to all of this that was wearing him down there was something else coming increasingly to attention , and that was inertia . His men would do what he told them to if he told them explicitly and specifically . Otherwise they would simply lie with their cheeks pressed to the ground and stare at him . Except for a few volunteers like Dale ; and Doll . Initiative may have been the descriptive word for the Civil War ; or enthusiasm . But apparently inertia was the one for this one . Stein had already talked to Tall about the Japanese evacuation of the lefthand grassy ridge , and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3d Platoon ; so he was dumbfounded  | when the Colonel began to shout at him over the sound power phone that he was too far to the right . He was not even given an opportunity to explain his proposed attack . The sound power phone was a great invention for explanations and one-sided conversations , because the listening party could not speak until the other turned it over and released the button ; but somehow Tall seemed able to make this work for hire , while Stein could not do the same . " But I do nt understand . What do you mean too far to the right ? I told you they 've evacuated the lefthand grassy ridge . And my 3d Platoon 's occupied it . How can I be too far to the right ? You agreed to attack from the right across our front . Over . " " God damn it , Stein ! " the Col 's cold thin angry voice cried . " I 'm telling you your left flank 's exposed . " Because of the phone Stein could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on with rhetoric . " Do you know what it is to expose your left flank ? Did you ever read in a tactics manual about exposing your left flank ? Your left flank is exposed . And damn it , you 've got to move down there . You 're not moving ! Over ! " The moment for protesting was past , lost while Tall 's thumb depressed the button . Stein could only defend , harrassed fury burning in him . " But God damn it , Colonel , that 's why I called you ! I 'm trying to ! I 'm preparing to attack the righthand grassy ridge right now . " He stopped , forgetting to say over ' , and there was a long silence . " Over , " he said . " God damn it . " " Stein , I told you you 're too far right already , " the Col 's voice came from the faroff areas of safety . " You 're sideslipping to the right alla time . Over . " " Well , what do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of my company to the lefthand grassy ridge , too ? Over . " That , he knew , would be insane . " No . I 've decided to commit the reserve company on your left ? with orders to attack . Orders to attack , Stein , you hear ? orders to attack . You stay where you are . I 'll have Baker Company 's commander send your reserve platoon back to you . Over . " " Do you want me to go ahead with my attack ? " Stein asked , because it was n't plain from what he 'd heard . " Over . " " What else ? " the Col 's thin , outraged voice piped at him .  | " What else , Stein ? You 're not supposed to be down there on a goddamned asshole vacation . Now , get cracking ! " There was a pause and Stein could hear electrical whinings and what sounded like polite mumblings . He heard one distinct , respectful " Yes , sir " in Tall 's voice . Then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , more jovial . " Get cracking , boy ! Get cracking ! " Tall said heartily . " Over and out . " Stein came back to himself to find himself looking into the wide , nervous eyes of Fife . He handed him the phone . Well , that was that . He had not even got to explain his attack plan , and he would have liked to because once again he could not be sure that he was right . But the big brass had arrived at the phone station , obviously . There was no point in trying to call back while Tall had those people clustered around him . Yes , the big brass . The observers . Today they even had an Admiral . Stein had a sudden and unholy , heartfreezing picture , which transfixed him for a moment , bulge-eyed , of an identical recurrence up there now of the scene he himself had witnessed on hill 207 two days ago . The same harrassed , apprehensive Battalion Colonel with field glasses ; the same diffident , but equally apprehensive little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the same massed mob of pawns and minor pieces craning to see like a stadium crowd ; all were up there right now , going through the identical gyrations their identical counterparts had gone through two days ago . While down below were the same blood-sweating Captains and their troops going through theirs . Only this time he himself , he Jim Stein , was one of them , one of the committed ones . The committed ones going through their exaggerated pretenses of invoking the cool calm logic and laws of the science of tactics . And tomorrow it would be someone else . It was a horrifying vision : all of them doing the same identical thing , all of them powerless to stop it , all of them devoutly and proudly believing themselves to be free individuals . It expanded to include the scores of nations , the millions of men , doing the same on thousands of hilltops across the world . And it did n't stop there . It went on . It was the concept  --  concept ? the fact ; the reality  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horrible a picture that Stein could not  | support or accept it . He put it away from him , and blinked his bulging eyes . What he had to do right now was get his Company Hq over behind the third fold with Keck and the 2d Platoon . From the top of the third fold there was really very little to see . Stein and his sergeants lay behind the crest and looked as they talked . In front of them perhaps a hundred yards away the waiting grassy ridge rose , apparently devoid of life . Behind it at some distance the upper reaches of The Elephant 's Head , their real objective , rose still higher . The stony open ground , thinly grassed , fell gently in a rolling motion for fifty yards , then leveled out . Tactically Lt Whyte ( whose body still lay just beyond the crest ) had served no good purpose at all with his charge , Stein saw immediately . Whyte 's platoon , situated further to the left where the white eyeballs and sweating faces of 2d Platoon now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wave not directed at either ridge but with its ends lapping against both , while the main strength bulged out into the open center which served only to funnel the fire from both ridges and the Hill itself . It could n't have been handled worse . But that was that . This was this . Stein 's problem now as he saw it , his first problem anyway , was the getting of his men from the comparative safety of here down that fucking outrageous bareass slope to the comparative safety of the foot of the ridge , where they would be defiladed from the MGs and protected from the mortars by their closeness to the Japanese . Once they were there ? But getting them there Stein had already decided to use only two squads of his 2d Platoon , augmented by the men already hiding down there . He was not sure this was enough , and he had not got to discuss it with Col Tall , but he did not want to commit more men until he had some idea of what was against him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In fact , he had given more thought to this than to the other . He was obsessed by a feeling of moral culpability about choosing which men to send in . Some of them would surely die , and he did not want to choose which ones . Rather than do that he decided simply to take arbitrarily the first two squads on the right of the line ( they were the closest ) , and thus let Luck or Chance  | or Fate or whatever agency ran the lives of men do the choosing . That way no agent of retribution could hold him responsible . Lying on the slope , he told Keck which ones he wanted . Keck , who certainly would know , who always knew just where his men were , nodded and said that that would be McCron 's and Beck 's squads , the 2d and the 3d . Stein nodded back , feeling sorry for them . McCron the motherhen , and Milly Beck the martinet . John Bell was in McCron 's squad . But before he could do anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know more about the men already down there . They were already there , and would n't have to run the gauntlet , but what sort of shape were they in ? Were any of them wounded ? Did they have a noncom with them ? Was their morale unbroken ? Stein felt he had to know , and the only way to find out was to send somebody . He sent Charlie Dale . It was an extraordinary performance . The little man licked his lips in their mean , dull grin , hitched up his rifle and Thompsongun , and nodded his head . Ile was ready to go . Stein , who had never liked him , and did n't like him now , watched him go with a growing admiration which only increased his dislike . He went dogtrotting and unblinking ( the thick set of his back made you know he was not blinking ) in a straight line down the open slope toward the grassy ridge . He ran bent over at the waist in that peculiar fashion everybody instinctively adopted , but he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he dived into the thicker grass and disappeared . Three minutes later he reappeared , and came dogtrotting and unblinking back . Stein could not help wondering what he thought about , but would not ask . Charlie Dale would have been pleased to have been asked . But he really did not think much of anything . He had been told that all Japs had bad eyes and wore glasses and were poor marksmen , anyway . He knew nothing could hit him . Going down , he concentrated his eyes and all his attention on the foot of the ridge . Coming back , he concentrated on a spot at the crest of the fold . The only thing he really thought about or felt was a querulous irritation that Storm and the other cooks had been sent off to the 3d Platoon and so were n't here to see him . This , and the fact that after he had  | completed one or two more of these things , he ought to be able to move into a rifle platoon as at least a corporal or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get out of the kitchen without having to become a private . This had been his secret plan from the beginning . And he had noted that casualties among the noncoms were already pretty heavy . Dale arrived back at the third fold a hero . In its way it was quite a feat , what he had done . Even from the crest of the fold it was possible to see the amount of MG and rifle fire which had been hitting the ground all around him . Everybody who had not wanted to go , and would not have gone , was pleased with him ; and Dale was pleased with himself . Everyone within reach slapped him on the back as he made his way to Stein to make his report , which was that they were all okay down there , that their morale was unimpaired , but that they did not have a noncom with them . They were all privates . " All right , " Stein said , still lying beside Keck on the reverse slope . " Now , listen . They have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't send anybody here away from his own squad . If you want to go back down there with the others when they go , I 'll make you an acting sergeant right now , and you 'll be in command of that extra squad . Do you want to do that ? " " Sure , " Dale said at once . He made his mean grin and licked his lips . " Sure , sir . " He bobbed his head on his perpetually hunched shoulders , and his expression changed to one of patently false humility . " If you think I 'm capable , sir . If you think I can do it . " Stein looked at him with distaste , not very well concealed . But it was concealed enough for Charlie Dale 's acumen . ? Or was it ? " Okay , " he said . " I make you acting sergeant . You 'll go down with the others . " " Aye , sir , " Dale said . " But do nt you have to say hereby ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to say hereby ? You know , to make it official . " In some slow-stirring , labyrinthine depth of his animal 's mind Dale seemed to be suspicious of Stein 's honesty . " No . I do nt have to say hereby . Hereby what ? I do nt have to  | say anything but what I 've said . You 're an acting sergeant . You 'll go down with the others . " " Aye , sir , " Dale said and crawled away . Stein and Keck exchanged a glance . " I think I better go down , too , Cap'n , " Keck said . " Somebody should be in charge down there . " Stein nodded , slowly . " I guess you 're right . But take care of yourself . I need you . " " I 'll take care of myself as good as anybody can around here , " was Keck 's humorless answer . Around them the tension over the attack was beginning to mount and be felt . It showed plainly on the faces of 2d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little group of leaders like a row of sunflowers turned toward the sun . On the left the first elements of the 3d Platoon had reappeared in the low between the second and third folds and were making their way toward Stein running bent over at the waist , the others following strung out behind them . Over the top of the second fold behind him another , lone figure came hurrying toward Stein , also running bent over at the waist . It was Witt returning , this time with his rifle and some extra bandoliers . Everything seemed to be concentrating . The moment of truth , Stein thought and looked at his watch , which said 12:02 . Moment of truth , shit . My God , could it have been that long ? It seemed like only seconds . And yet it seemed like years , too . It was at this moment that Pfc Doll  --  or his fate for him  --  chose to return from his hazardous mission to 1st Platoon . Doll came running up the slight slope at about the middle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then scrambled along the reverse slope to where Stein was , to report . He had found Sgt Culn . But arriving at the knot of leaders he collapsed , sobbing for breath for almost a minute . There was no giggling this time , and no arch display of insouciance . His face was drawn and strained , the lines beside his open mouth deeply etched . He had run along the uneven line of holes calling for Skinny Culn , with fire being put down all around him . Men had looked up at him from their holes with startled disbelief on their faces . His body , abetted by his imagination , had quickly reached the point where it was threaten-  | ing to disobey him . Finally three holes in front of him a hand and arm had shot into the air , the hand describing the old circular hand-and-arm-signal for ' Gather here . ' Doll had pulled up to find Culn lying placidly on his side and grinning up at him ruefully , his rifle hugged against his chest . " Come right in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The hole was n't big enough for two men . They had huddled together in it while Doll brought Culn up to date on the casualties , told him Stein 's plan , told him 1st Platoon 's part in it . Culn had scratched his reddish stubble . " So I got the platoon . Well , well . Okay , tell him I 'll try . But you tell Bugger we 're sort of de-morale-ized down here , as it says in the field manuals . But I 'll do the best I can . " Seconds later Doll had been back behind the third fold in what seemed to him to be enormous safety , and then reporting to Stein . He made his report proudly . Doll did not know what kind of reception he had expected from them , but it was not the one that he got . Charlie Dale had already returned before him , and from a tougher mission , and with much less display of nerves . 3d Platoon was in the act of arriving , and had to be taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coming attack made everybody rather preoccupied , anyway . Bugger listened to his report and nodded , gave him a pat on the arm as one might toss a fish to a trained seal after its act , and dismissed him . Doll had no choice but to crawl away , his bravery and heroism ignored and unappreciated . Wondering that he was still alive , he ached to tell somebody how narrowly he had escaped death . And then , as he sat down and looked up , time adding salt to his wounds was Charlie Dale , sitting nearby and grinning a rapaciously superior grin at him . While he sat and stared hack at him , Doll was forced to listen to little Private Bead , lying beside him , recount the tale of Dale 's exploit . Nor was Dale all . Witt , the mad volunteer , the crazy sentimental Kentuckian who wanted to come back to a rifle company under fire , had been crouching behind Doll all during Doll 's report , waiting his own turn at Stein . Now he reported too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he immediately asked permission to go along . Stein , unable to hide his stunned disbelief entirely , nodded his agreement and sent Witt over to Milly  | Beck 's squad . It was this final straw , this blow in the face by Fate , added to the knowledge that Charlie Dale was going  --  and as an acting sergeant yet , which made Doll open his mouth and speak up . As much a reflex as the yell of a man pricked with a knife , Doll heard his voice . With horror he listened to himself asking , in a clear , bell-like , resolute , confident tone , if he could not go along himself . When Stein said yes and sent him to McCron 's squad , he crawled away biting the inside of his lip so hard that it brought tears to his eyes . He was wishing he could do worse : bang his head up and down on a rock ; bite a whole chunk out of his arm . Why did he do things like this to himself ? Why did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everything was arranged . They could get on with it any time . Stein and Keck lay side by side behind the little crest , with 1st Sgt Welsh lying beside them in a flat-faced , uncommunicative silence , and looked it over one more time . Stein had placed 3d Platoon about thirty yards behind and below them on the slope , in two echelons of two squads each ; they were to be ready to attack and exploit any advantage which arose . He had sent word back to his mortar section to raise their fire further up the ridge . He had his one remaining machine gun placed behind the crest of the third fold . Off to the left on the lefthand grassy ridge a lot of fire was being put forth but Stein did not see any of B-for-Baker moving . As he watched , two Japanese mortar rounds landed and went up , there . It was impossible to tell if they hurt anyone . " I think we better send them down in bunches of three or four , at irregular intervals , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're all there , space them out . Advance them by rushes , or in a line . Use your own judgment . ? I guess you might as well go . " " I 'll take the first bunch down myself , " Keck said huskily , staring down the slope . " Listen , Cap'n , " he said , looking at Stein , and at Brass Band who had just come up , " there 's somethin I wanted to tell you . That guy Bell is a good man . He 's pretty steady . He helped me get going and get the platoon out of that hole we were in after that charge . " He paused . " I just wanted to tell you . " " Okay . I 'll remember . " Stein felt an unnamable , nigh-unbearable  | anguish that he could not do anything about . It forced him to look away down the slope . Beside him Keck started to crawl off . " Give them hell , Sergeant ! " George Band said cheerily . " Give them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look back . " Yeh , " he said . The two squads , with their three extra men , had more or less separated themselves from the other half of the platoon . The most of them , in their bodily attitudes and in their faces , resembled sheep about to be led to the slaughter pens in Chicago . They waited . Keck had only to crawl to them and instruct them . " Okay , you guys . This is it . We 're goin down in groups of four . No point in goin by rushes , only make a better target stopped . So run all the way . We ai nt got any choice . We 're picked , and so we got to go . I 'll take the first bunch myself to show you how easy it is . I want Charlie Dale with me . Dale ? So you can organize them guys that 's down there . Let 's move out . " He started the crawl to the jumpoff point just beyond the knot of officers and CP men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overt cowardice ( if it could be called that , and if S/Sgt Stack could be omitted ) occurred in C-for-Charlie . A big , beautifully muscled man named Sico , an Italian draftee from Philly with some five months service , suddenly sat down in his tracks and began to hold his stomach and groan . It blocked the line behind him and when somebody called , the ones in front stopped also . Keck crawled back to him . His squad sergeant , Beck the martinet , crawled over to him too . Beck was very young for a martinet , but he was a very good one . The rifles of his squad had been the most perfect at inspections since he came into the company with six years service and immediately got promoted . Withal , he still was not really mean , only stern . Ile was not very bright at anything else or even interested , but soldiering was his code . Right now he appeared deeply ashamed that anything like this could happen to any man in his squad , and because of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sico , " he said in his stern , command voice . " Or I 'll kick you so hard in that stomach you 'll really be sick . "  | " I ca n't , Sergeant , " Sico said . His face was drawn up grotesquely . And his eyes were puddles of terror , bottomless , anguished , and a little guilty . " I would if I could . You know I would . I 'm sick . " " Sick , my foot , " said Beck , who never swore much , and for whom the phrase God damn you was inordinately strong . " Hold it , Beck , " Keck said . " What is it , Sico ? " " I do nt know , Sergeant . It 's my stomach . Pains . And cramps . I ca n't straighten up . I 'm sick , " he said , looking at Keck appealingly out of the dark , tortured holes of his eyes . " I 'm sick , " he said again , and as if to prove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bend over and the vomit burped up out of him and ran down over his fatigue shirt onto his hands which held his belly . He looked at Keck hopefully , but appeared ready to do it again if necessary . Keck studied him a moment . " Leave him , " he said to Beck . " Come on . ? The medics will take care of you , Sico , " he said to Sico . " Thank you , Sergeant , " Sico said . " But ? " Beck began . " Do nt argue with me , " Keck said , already crawling away . " Right , " Beck said , and followed . Sico continued to sit and watched the others pass . The medics did indeed take care of him . One of them , the junior , though he looked much like his shyfaced , bespectacled senior , came and led him back to the rear , Sico walking bent over in pain with his hands holding his stomach . He groaned audibly from time to time and now and then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vomit more . His face was haunted-looking and his eyes tormented . But clearly nobody would ever convince him he had not been sick . Whenever he looked at the C-for-Charlie men he passed , it was appealingly , a certain unspoken request for understanding , for belief . As for the others , they looked back noncommittally . None of their faces held contempt . Instead , under the white-eyed sweating pucker of fear , there was a hint of sheepish envy , as if they would have liked to do the same but were afraid they could not bring it off . Sico , who could undoubtedly read this look , apparently got no comfort from it . He tottered on , helped by the junior medic , and the last that C-for-Charlie ever saw of him was when he hobbled out of sight beyond the second fold .  | In the meantime Keck 's men had begun their gauntlet-running . Keck led off with Dale and two other men . Each squad sergeant , first Milly Beck then McCron , supervised the jumpoff of his men in groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except two . Of these one , a Mississippi farmer ' boy ' of nearly forty named Catt , about whom nobody in the company knew anything for the simple reason that he never talked , was killed outright . But with the other something really bad happened for the first time in the day . At first they thought the second one was dead too . Hit running , he had fallen , bounced hard , and lain still like the Mississippian . So that was that . When a man was hit and killed outright , there was nothing anyone could do . The man had ceased to exist . The living went right on living , without him . On the other hand , the wounded were evacuated . They would live or die someplace else . So they too ceased to exist to the men they left behind , and could be forgotten also . Without a strong belief in a Valhalla , it was as good a way to handle the problem as any , and made everybody feel better . But this was not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Massachusetts , who , as he liked jokingly to say , ' had not gone to Harvard , but he had dug many a cesspool underneath its ivy-covered walls . ' Actually , Tella did not begin to yell , at least not loud enough to be heard by Bugger Stein 's CP , until after Keck had framed and then carried out most of his attack . And by that time lots of other things were happening . For the moment , there was still nothing much to be seen from the top of the fold . Two new bodies lay on the slope , and that was all . Keck and his running men had ( lived headfirst into the taller grass and apparently disappeared from the face of the earth . The yammering of the cortex of Japanese fire had ceased . Quiet  --  at least , a comparative quiet , if one disregarded the racketing and banging which still hung and jounced everywhere high in the air ? reigned over the grassy ridge . On the third fold they lay and waited , watching . Unfortunately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heights of The Elephant 's Head , had seen the forward movement of American troops , too . A mortar round exploded in the low  | between the folds . That one hurt nobody , but more followed . Mortar shells began exploding their fountains of terror , dirt and fragments along the rearward slope every minute or so , as the Japanese gunners fingered the area searching American flesh . It was not a barrage , but it was very nervewracking , and it wounded some men . Because of it , only a very few , Stein , Band and Welsh among them , actually saw Keck 's attack . Most were as flat to the ground as they could get . Stein felt it was his duty to watch , to observe . Anyway , there was very little choice as to cover . There were no holes here , and one flat place was as good as another . So he lay , only his eyes and helmet above the crest of the fold , and waited and watched . He could not escape a distinct premonition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squarely in the center of his back . He did not know why Band had decided to watch too , but suspected that it was in the hope of seeing some new wounded , though he knew this was unfair . And as for Welsh , Stein could not even imagine why this flatfaced , expressionless man should want to expose himself to watch , especially since he had not said a single word to anyone since offering his Thompsongun to Keck . The three of them lay there while a mortar shell blew up somewhere behind diem , then a minute later another , than almost a minute later still another . There were no screams with any of them . When they finally did see men , it was about a third of the way up the ridge . Keck had crawled his men that far unseen . Now they rose in a line , which bellied downhill somewhat in the center like a rope bellying of its own weight , and began to scamper uphill firing as they went . Almost immediately the Japanese fire began to hammer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pvt Alfredo Tella of Cambridge Mass had begun to yell before this , no one had heard him . And in the intensity of the action and of watching , no one was to hear him until it was over . In fact , it did not last long . But while it did , many things happened . Arriving in the defiladed area , Keck had first turned his attention to organizing the disorganized group of privates already there , and sent Dale to do that . Then he himself lay in the grass directing the others off to the right as they arrived . When the line  | was formed , he gave the order to crawl . The grass which was about chest high here had a matted , tangled underlayer of old stems . It choked them with dust , tied up their arms and feet , made it impossible to see . They crawled for what seemed an eternity . It required tremendous exertion . Most of them had long since used up all of their water , and it was this as much as anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ halt . He judged they were about half way up the slope , and he did n't want them to start passing out on him . For a moment as Keck lay gathering his will power he thought about their faces as they arrived and dived into the grass down below : whites of the eyes showing , mouths open and drawn , skin around the eyes pinched and tight . They had all arrived terrified . They had all arrived reluctant . Keck felt no sympathy for them , any more than he felt sympathy for himself . He was terrified too . Taking a deep breath he stood straight up in the grass yelling at them : " Up ! Up ! Up ! Up and GO ! " From the top of the fold they could take the ' operation in at a glance , and follow its progress . This was not so easy on the ridge itself . But John Bell standing rifle in hand and trying to shoot and run in the thick grass was able to see several important things . He was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover his face with his hands and sit down weeping . When they had first stood up , the fury of the Japanese fire had struck them like a windtormented hailstorm . The Japanese had been smart and had waited , conserving their fire till they had targets . Four men of McCron 's squad went down at once . On the right a young draftee named Wynn was shot in the throat and screamed , " Oh , my God ! " in a voice of terror and disbelief as a geyser of blood spurted from his neck . Ridiculously like a rag doll he Ml and disappeared in the grass . Next to him 1'fc Earl , a little shorter , was caught in the face , perhaps from the same burst . Ile went clown without a sound , looking as if he 'd been hit in the face with a tomato . To Bell 's left two other men tumbled , yelling with fear that they were killed . All this was apparently too much for McCron , who had clucked over and mothered this squad of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his rifle and sat down crying . Bell himself was astonished that he himself was not already struck down dead . He  | only knew , could only think one thing . That was to keep going . He had to keep going . If he ever wanted to get back home again to his wife Marty , if he ever wanted to see her again , kiss her , put himself between her breasts , between her legs , fondle , caress , and touch her , he had to keep going . And that meant he had to keep the others going with him , because it was useless to keep going by himself . It had to stop . There had to be a point in time where it ended . In a cracked bellow he began to harangue the remainder of McCron 's 2d Squad . In back of and a little below him off in the center as he looked behind , he saw Milly Beck leading his men in a fury of snarling hatred which shocked Bell numbly : Beck who was always so controlled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet came Keck , roaring and firing Welsh 's Thompsongun uphill . A silly phrase came in Bell 's mind and he began to yell at the other men senselessly . " Home for Christmas ! Home for Christmas ! " Keep going . Keep going . It was a ridiculous thought , a stupid idea in any case and he would wonder later why he had it . Obviously , if he wanted to stay alive to get home , the best thing to do would have been to lie down in the grass and hide . It was Charlie Dale on the far left who saw the first emplacement , the first live one any of them had ever actually seen . Far enough left to be beyond their flank , it was a one-gun job , a simple hole dug in the ground and covered over with sticks and kunai grass . From the dark hole he could see the muzzle spitting fire at him . Actually , Dale was probably the calmest of the lot . Imaginationless , he had organized his makeshift squad , and found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell them what to do . Now he urged them on , but not bellowing or roaring like Keck and Bell . Dale thought it looked much better , was far more seemly , if a noncom did not yell like that . So far he had not fired a shot . What was the point , when there were no targets ? When he saw the emplacement , he carefully released his safety and fired a long burst with his Thompsongun , straight into the hole twenty yards away . Before he could release the trigger the gun jammed , solidly . But his burst was enough to stop the machinegun , at least momentarily , and Dale ran toward it pulling a grenade from his shirt . From ten yards  | away he threw the grenade like a baseball , wrenching hell out of his shoulder . The grenade disappeared through the hole , then blew up scattering sticks and grass and three rag dolls and upending the machinegun . Dale turned back to his squad , licking his lips and grinning with beady pride . " Come on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's keep it moving . " They were almost done with it . Off to the right of center Pfc Doll and another man discovered a second small emplacement simultaneously . They fired a clip apiece into its hole and Doll grenaded it , keeping up his unspoken competition with Charlie Dale , even if he was n't an acting sergeant . Wait 'll he hears about that , he thought happily , because he did n't know that Dale had got one too . But the happiness was shortlived , for Doll and everybody else , as they ran on . Knocking out two one-gun emplacements made no appreciable difference in the volume of the Japanese fire . MGs still hammered at them from seemingly every quarter of the globe . Men were still going down . They still had not located any main strongpoints . Directly in front of them thirty yards away a rock outcropping formed a four-foot ledge which extended clear across their front . Instinctively everyone began to run for that , while behind them Keck , gasping , bellowed the useless order : " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in behind its protection pellmell , all of them sobbing audibly with exhaustion . The exertion and the heat had been too much . Several men vomited . One man made it to the ledge , gurgled once senselessly , then  --  his eyes rolling back in his head  --  fainted from heat prostration . There was nothing with which to cover him for shade . Beck the martinet loosened his belt and clothes . Then they lay against the ledge in the midday sun and smelled the hot , summer-smelling dust . Insects hummed around them . The fire had stopped . " Well , what 're we gon na do now , Keck ? " someone asked finally . " We 're gon na stay right here . Maybe they 'll get some reinforcements up to us . " " Ha ! To do what ? " " To capture these goddam fucking positions around here ! " Keck cried fretfully . " What you think ? "  | " You mean you really want to go on with it ? " " I do nt know . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some reinforcements , we can scout around and maybe locate where all these goddam fucking MGs are . Anyway , it 's better than going back down through that . You want to go back down ? " Nobody answered this , and Keck did not feel it necessary to elaborate . By counting heads they found that they had left twelve men behind them on the slope killed or wounded . This was almost a full squad , almost a full third of their number . It included McCron . When Bell told him about McCron , Keck appointed Bell acting sergeant in his place ; Bell could n't have cared less . " He 'll have to look out for himself , like the rest of the wounded , " Keck said . They continued to lie in the hot sun . Ants crawled on the ground at the foot of the ledge . " What if the Japs come down here in force and throw us off of here ? " somebody asked . " I do nt think they will , " Keck said . " ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better have a sentry . Doll . " Bell lay with his face against the rock facing Witt . Witt lay looking back . Quietly in the insect-humming heat they lay and looked at each other . Bell was thinking that Witt had come through it all all right . Like himself . What power was it which decided one man should be hit , be killed , instead of another man ? So Bugger 's little feeling attack was over . If this were a movie , this would be the end of the show and something would be decided . In a movie or a novel they would dramatize and build to the climax of the attack . When the attack came in the film or novel , it would be satisfying . It would decide something . It would have a semblance of meaning and a semblance of an emotion . And immediately after , it would be over . The audience could go home and think about the semblance of the meaning and feel the semblance of the emotion . Even if the hero got killed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , creative art  --  was shit . Beside him Witt , who was apparently not bothered by any of these problems , raised himself to his knees and cautiously stuck his head up over the ledge . Bell went on with his thinking . Here there was no semblance of meaning . And the emotions  | were so many and so mixed up that they were indecipherable , could not be untangled . Nothing had been decided , nobody had learned anything . But most important of all , nothing had ended . Even if they had captured this whole ridge , nothing would have ended . Because tomorrow , or the ( lay after , or the day after that , they would be called upon to do the same thing again  --  maybe under even worse circumstances . The concept was so overpowering , so numbing , that it shook Bell . Island after island , hill after hill , beachhead after beachhead , year after year . It staggered him . It would certainly end sometime , sure , and almost certainly ? because of industrial production  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no connection with any individual man engaged now . Some men would survive , but no one individual man could survive . It was a discrepancy in methods of counting . The whole thing was too vast , too complicated , too technological for any one individual man to count in it . Only collections of men counted , only communities of men , only numbers of men . The weight of such a proposition was deadening , almost too heavy to be borne , and Bell wanted to turn his mind away from it . Free individuals ? Ha ! Somewhere between the time the first Marines had landed here and this battle now today , American warfare had changed from individualist warfare to collectivist warfare  --  or perhaps that was only his illusion , perhaps it only seemed like that to him because he himself was now engaged . But free individuals ? What a fucking myth ! Numbers of free individuals , maybe ; collectives of free individuals . And so the point of Bell 's serious thinking finally emerged . At some unspecified moment between this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Bell that statistically , mathematically , arithnletically , any way you wanted to count it , he John Bell could not possibly live through this war . He could not possibly go home to his wife Marty Bell . So it did not really make any difference what Marty did , whether she stepped out on him or not , because he would not be there to accuse her . The emotion which this revelation created in Bell was not one of sacrifice , resignation , acceptance , and peace . Instead , it was an irritating , chaffing emotion of helpless frustration which made him  | want to crawl around rubbing his flanks and back against rocks to ease the itch . He still had not moved his face from the rock . Beside him Witt , still kneeling and peering out , yelled suddenly . Simultaneously Doll yelled too from down at the other end . " Something 's comin ! " " Something 's comin ! Somebody 's comin at us ! " As one man the line behind the ledge swept up and forward , rifles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starvedlooking Japanese men were running down at them across an ungrassed area carrying hand grenades in their right hands and bayoneted rifles in their left . Keck 's Thompson , after his firing of almost all its ammo on the way up , had finally jammed , too . Neither gun could be unstuck . But the massed riflefire from the ledge disposed of the seven Japanese men quickly . Only one was able even to throw ; and his grenade , a dud , landed short . At the same moment the dud grenade should have exploded , there was a loud , ringing , halfmuffled explosion behind them . In the excitement of the attack and defense they continued to fire into the seven bodies up the slope . When they ceased , only two bodies continued to move . Aiming deliberately in the sudden quiet , Witt the Kentuckian put a killing round into each of them . " You never can tell about them tricky suicidal bastards , " he said . " Even when they 're hit . " It was Bell who first remembered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caused it . What he saw was Sgt Keck lying on his back with his eyes closed , in a strangely grotesque position , still holding the ring and safety pin of a hand grenade in his right hand . Bell called out , and rushing to him , they rolled him over gently and saw that there was nothing they could do for him . His entire right buttock and part of his back had been blown away . Some of his internal organs were visible , pulsing busily away , apparently going about their business as if nothing had happened . Steadily , blood welled in the cavity . Gently they laid him back . It was obvious what had happened . In the attack , perhaps because his Thompsongun was jammed , but at any rate not firing his rifle , Keck had reached in his hip pocket to pull out a grenade . And in the excitement he had gotten it by the pin . Bell , for one , experienced a dizzying , near-fainting terror momentarily , at the thought of Keck  | standing and looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back from the line and sat down against a little dirt hummock to protect the others . Then the grenade had gone off . Keck made no protest when they moved him . He was conscious , but apparently did not want to talk and preferred to keep his eyes closed . Two of them sat with him and tried to talk to him and reassure him while the others went back to the line , but Keck did not answer and kept his eyes shut . The little muscles at the corners of his mouth twitched jerkily . He spoke only once . Without opening his eyes he said clearly , " What a fucking recruit trick to pull . " Five minutes later he stopped breathing . The men went back . Milly Beck , as the senior noncom present , was now in command . Stein had watched the silly little Japanese counter-attack from the top of the third fold . The seven Japanese men had come out from behind a huge outcrop , already running and already too close to the Americans for Stein to dare tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to failure anyway . What made them do it ? Why , if they wanted to throw Stein 's platoon off the ridge , did they not come in force ? Why just seven men ? And why come across the open ground ? They could have slipped down through the grass until they were on top of Keck and thrown the grenades from there . Were those seven men doing all that on their own , without orders ? Or were they some kind of crazy religious volunteers who wanted into Nirvana , or whatever it was they called it ? Stein did not understand them , and had never understood them . Their incredibly delicate , ritual tea service ; their exquisitely sensitive painting and poetry ; their unbelievably cruel , sadistic beheadings and torture . He was a peaceful man . They frightened him . When the riflefire from the platoon took care of the seven so easily , he awaited a second , larger attack , but knowing somehow intuitively that one would not come , and he was right . Stein had not thought anyone was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the men all clustered around one figure on the ground . On the ridge they were slightly above his own height here , now , and at this distance  --  more than two hundred yards  --  it was impossible to tell who it was . Hoping desperately that it was not Keck , he called to Band to give him back his glasses , focused  | them , and saw that it was . Almost immediately a rifle bullet whooshed past him only inches from his head . Startled wide-eyed , he jerked down and rolled over twice to his left . He had forgotten to shield the lenses , and they had glinted . This time he cupped them with his hands , verified that it was Keck dead , then saw that Sgt Beck was looking at him  --  or anyway toward him  --  and making the Old Army hand-and-arm signal for " Converge on me . " He wanted reinforcements ? ! Thirty-five yards behind Stein another mortar shell exploded and somebody yelled . Again he ducked . Exertion , nervous exhaustion , and fear were wearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could not believe it was after one . Suddenly he was ravenous . Putting down the glasses , he got out a bar of D Ration and tried to munch it but could not get it down because his mouth was so dry from lack of water . He spat most of it out . When he looked again with the glasses , Beck was again making his hand-and-arm signal . As he watched , Beck stopped and turned back to the ledge . Stein cursed . His little three-squad attack had failed , bogged down . They had not been nearly enough men . Stein very seriously doubted if he even had that many men . He had just watched two full platoons of B-for-Baker on the lefthand ridge come running back from a failed attack up the Bowling Alley in an attempt to outflank the righthand grassy ridge . And Beck wanted reinforcements ! That whole fucking outrageous ridge was one giant honeycomb of emplacements . It was a regular fortress . He himself was fast nearing the limbo of total mental exhaustion . It was hard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually full of fear . And Beck wanted reinforcements ! Stein had lain and watched Keck lead his three pitiful little squads up that goddamned ridge with tears in his eyes . Beside him George Band had lain and watched eagerly through the glasses , smiling toughly . But Stein had choked up , cried enough moisture so that everything blurred and he had to wipe his eyes out quickly . He had personally counted every one of the twelve to go down . They were his men , and he had failed in his responsibility to each one who fell . And now he was being asked to send more after them . Well , he could give him the two remaining squads of 2d Platoon .  | Pull them back out and put the reserve 3d Platoon up on the crest to fire cover . That would work all right . But before he did it , he intended to talk to Col Tall and get Tall 's opinion and assent . Stein simply did not want that responsibility , not all alone . Rolling over , he motioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he was bushed . It was just then that Stein first heard from down in the little valley the first thin , piping yells . They sounded insane . What they lacked in volume , and they lacked a great deal , they more than made up in their penetrating qualities , and in their length . They came in a series , each lasting five full seconds , the whole lasting thirty seconds . Then there was silence under the high-hanging , jouncing racket of noise . " Jesus ! " Stein said fervently . He looked over at Band , whom he found looking back at him with squinted , dilated eyes . " Christ ! " Band said . From below , high and shrill , the series of yells came again . They were not screams . Stein was able to pick him out easily with the glasses , which brought him up very close , too close for comfort . He had fallen almost at the bottom of the slope , seventy-five or eighty yards , not far from the other one , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was clearly dead . Now he was trying to crawl back . He had been hit squarely in the groin with a burst of heavy MG fire which had torn his whole belly open . Lying on his back , his head uphill , both hands pressed to his belly to hold his intestines in , he was inching his way back up the slope with his legs . Through the glasses Stein could see blue-veined loops of intestine bulging between the bloodstained fingers . Inching was hardly the word , since Stein estimated he was making less than half an inch per try . He had lost his helmet , and his head thrown back on his neck , his mouth and his eyes wide open , lie was staring directly up at Stein as if he were looking into a Promised Land . As Stein watched , he stopped , laid his head flat , and closing his eyes he made his series of yells again . They came to Stein 's ears faintly , exactly in the same sequence as they had before . Then , resting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Help me ! Help me ! " Stein heard . Feeling sick and dizzy in the  | area of his diaphragm , he lowered the glasses and handed them to Band . " Tella , " he said . Band looked a long time . Then he too lowered the glasses . There was a flat , scared look in his eyes when he looked back at Stein . " What 're we gon na do ? " Band said . Trying to think of some answer to this , Stein felt something touch him on the leg . He yelped and jumped , fear running all through his body like quicksilver . Whirling around , he found himself staring downslope into the fear-ridden eyes of Corporal Fife , who was holding out to him the telephone . Too upset even to be sheepish or angry , Stein waved him away impatiently . " Not now . Not now . " He began to call for a medic , one of whom was already on his way . From below the insane series of yells came again , identical , unchanging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have heard them . The entire remainder of the 2d Platoon lying along the crest of the fold had heard them . So had the medic who was now running bentover along the slope to Stein . So had File . When his commander waved hint away with the telephone , Fife had collapsed exactly where he was and flattened himself as low to the ground as he could get . The mortar shells were still falling at roughly one-minute intervals ; sometimes you could hear their fluttery shu-ing sound for two seconds before they hit ; and Fife was completely terrorized by them . He had lost the power to think reasonably , and had become a piece of inert protoplasm which could be made to move , but only when the proper stimuli were applied . Since making up his mind that he would do exactly what he was told , but exactly that and no more , he had lain exactly where he had been until Stein called him for the telephone . Now he lay exactly where he had dropped and waited to be told to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had no desire to see or do more . If his body would not work well , his mind could , and Fife realized that by far the great majority of the company were reacting like himself . But there were still those others who , for one reason or another of their own , got up and walked about and offered to do things without being told first . Fife knew it ,  | because he had seen them  --  otherwise he would n't have believed it . His reaction to these was one of intense , awed hero worship composed of about two-thirds grinding hate , and shame . But when he tried to force his body to stand up and walk around , he simply could not make it do it . He was glad that he was a clerk whose job was to take care of the telephone and not a squad noncom up there with Keck , Beck , McCron and the others , but he would have preferred to be a clerk at Battalion Hq back on Hill tog , and more than that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but most of all a clerk at Army Hq in Australia , or in the United States . Just above him up the slope he could hear Bugger Stein talking with the medic , and he caught the phrase " his belly blown open . " Then he caught the word " Tella " . So it was Tella who was yelling down there like that . It was the first concrete news Fife had had of anyone since the two dead lieutenants and Grove . He pressed his face to the dirt sickly , while Bugger and the medic moved off a few feet for another look . Tella had used to be a buddy of his , for a while at least . Built like a Greek god , never very bright , he was the most amiable of men , despite his career in life as a honeydipper in Cambridge Mass . And now Tella was suffering in actual reality the fate which Fife all morning had been imagining would be his own . Fife felt sick . It was so different from the books he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trepidation at even raising it that far , he lifted his head a fraction off the dirt to peer with pain-haunted , fear-punctured eyes at the two men with the binoculars . They were still talking . " Can you tell ? " Stein asked , anxiously . " Yes , sir . Enough , " the medic said . He was the senior one , the more studious looking . Ile handed the glasses to Stein and put back on his spectacles . " ' There 's nothing anybody can do that 'll help him . He 'll be dead before they can ever get him back to a surgeon . And he 's got dirt all over his bowels . Even sulfa wo n't fix that . In these jungles ? " There was a pause before Stein spoke again . " How long ? " " Two hours ? Four , maybe ? Maybe only one , or less . " " But , God damn it , man ! " Stein exploded . " We ca n't any of us  | stand it that long ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't ask you to go down there . " The medic studied the terrain . He blinked several times behind his glasses . " Maybe it 's worth a try . " " But you said yourself nobody could do anything to help him . " " At least I could get a syrette of morphine into him . " " Would one be enough ? " Stein asked . " I mean , you know , would it keep him quiet ? " The medic shook his head . " Not for long . " He paused . " But I could give him two . And I could leave him three or four for himself . " " But maybe he would n't take them . He 's delirious . Could n't you just , sort of , give them all to him at once ? " Stein said . The medic turned to look at him . " That would kill him , sir . " " Oh , " Stein said . " I could n't do that , " the medic said . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said grimly . " Well , do you want to try it ? " From below the set , unchanging series of yells , the strangely mechanical cries of the man they were talking about , rose up to them , precise , inflexible , mad , a little quavery toward the end , this time . " God , I hope he do nt begin to cry , " Stein said . " God damn it ! " he yelled , balling a fist . " My company wo n't have any fighting spirit left at all if we do nt do something about him ! " " I 'll go , sir , " the medic said solemnly , answering the question of before . " After all , it 's my job . And after all , it 's worth a try , is n't it , sir ? " he said , nodding significantly toward the spot where the series of yells had now ceased . " To stop the yells . " " God , " Stein said , " I do nt know . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before , you know . They wo n't hit me , sir . " " But you were on the left . It 's not as bad there . " " I 'm volunteering , " the medic said , blinking at his Captain owlishly . Stein waited several seconds before he spoke . " When do you want to go ? " " Any time , " the medic said . " Right now . " He started to get up .  | Stein put out a restraining arm . " No , wait . At least I can give you some covering fire . " " I 'd rather go now , sir . And get it over with . " They had been lying side by side , their helmets almost touching as they talked , and now Stein turned to look at the boy . He could not help wondering whether he had talked this boy into volunteering . Perhaps he had . He sighed . " Okay . Go ahead . " The medic nodded , looking straight ahead this time , then sprang up into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fold . It was all over almost before it got started . Running like some fleeting forest animal , his medic 's web equipment flopping , he reached the damaged Tella , swung round to face him up the hill , then dropped to his knees , his hands already groping at the pouch which held his syrettes . Before he could get the protective cap off the needle , one MG , one single MG , opened up from the ridge stitching across the area . Through the glasses Stein watched him jerk straight up , eyes and mouth wide , face slack , not so much with disbelief or mental shock as with sheer simple physiological surprise . One of the objects which had struck him , not meeting bone , was seen to burst forth through the front of him puffing out the green cloth , taking a button with it and opening his blouse a notch . Stein through the glasses saw him jab the now-bared needle , whether deliberately by design or from sheer reflex , into his own forearm below the rolled up sleeve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the syrette and his hands beneath him . He did not move again . Stein , still holding the glasses on him , waited . He could not escape a feeling that something more important , more earthshaking should happen . Seconds ago he was alive and Stein was talking to him ; now he was dead . Just like that . But Stein 's attention was pulled away before he could think more , pulled away by two things . One was Tella , who now began to scream in a high quavery babbling falsetto of hysteria totally different from his former yells . Looking at him now through the glasses  --  he had almost forgotten him entirely in watching the medic  --  Stein saw that he had flopped himself over on his side , face pressing the dirt . Obviously he had been hit again , and while one bloodstained hand tried to hold in  | his intestines , the other groped at the new wound in his chest . Stein wished that at least they had killed him , if they were going to shoot him up again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to draw sobbing breath , was infinitely more bad than the yells for everyone concerned , both in its penetration and in its longevity . But they were not firing more now . And as if to prove it deliberate a faint faraway voice called several times in an Oriental accent , " Cly , Yank , cly ! Yerl , Yank , yerl ! " The other thing which caught Stein 's attention was something which caught the corner of his eye in the glasses as he lay looking at Tella and wondering what to do . A figure emerged from the grass on the righthand ridge plodding rearward across the flat and began to mount the forward slope of the fold . Turning the glasses on him , Stein saw that it was his Sergeant McCron , that he was wringing his hands , and that he was weeping . On his dirty face two great white streaks of clean skin ran from eye to chin accentuating the eyes as if he were wearing the haunting makeup of a tragic actor in some Greek drama . And on he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up all across the ridge , making dirt puffs all around him . Still he came on , shoulders hunched , face twisted , wringing his hands , looking more like an old woman at a wake than an infantry combat soldier , neither quickening his pace nor dodging . In a kind of incredulous fury Stein watched him , frozen to the glasses . Nothing touched him . When he reached the top of the fold , he sat down beside his Captain still wringing his hands and weeping . " Dead , " he said . " All- dead , Capn . Every one . I 'm the only one . All twelve . Twelve young men . I looked after them . Taught them everything I knew . Helped them . It did n't mean a thing . Dead . " Obviously , he was talking only of his own twelve-man squad , all of whom Stein knew could not be dead . From below , because he was still sitting up in the open beside his prone Captain , someone seized him by the ankle and hauled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had seen the vomiting Sico go and who now lay looking up at McCron with his own fear-starting eyes , there was some look not exactly sly about his face but which appeared to say that while what he was telling  | was the truth , it was not all the truth , and which made Fife believe that like Sico McCron had found his own reasonable excuse . It did not make Fife angry . On the contrary , it made him envious and he yearned to find some such mechanism which he might use with success himself . Stein apparently felt somewhat the same thing himself . With only one further look at the handwringing , still weeping , but now safe McCron , Stein turned his head and called for the medic . " Here , sir , " the junior medic said from immediately below him . He had come up on his own . " Take him back . Stay with him . And when you get back there , tell them we need another medic now . At least one . " " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come on , Mac . That 's it . Come on , boy . It 'll be all right . It 'll all be all right . " " You do nt understand that they 're all dead , " McCron said earnestly . " How can it be all right ? " But he allowed himself to be led off by the arm . The last C-for-Charlie saw of him was when he and the medic dropped behind the second fold , now seventy-five to a hundred yards behind them . Some of them were to see his haunted face in the Division 's hospital later , but the company as a whole saw him no more . Stein sighed . With this last , new crisis out of the way and taken care of , he could turn his attention back to Tella . The Italian was still screaming his piercing wailing scream and did not seem to show any indication that he was ever going to run down . If it kept on , it was going to unnerve them all . For a fleet second Stein had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shooting the dying man through the head . You saw that in movies and read it in books . But the vision died sickly away , unfulfilled . He was n't the type and he knew it . Behind him his reserve platoon , cheeks pressed to earth , stared at him from their tense , blank , dirty faces in a long line of white , nerve-racked eyes . The screaming seemed to splinter the air , a huge circular saw splitting giant oak slabs , shivering spinal columns to fragments . But Stein did not know what to do . He could not send another man down there . He had to give up . A hot unbelieving outraged fury seized him at the thought of McCron plodding leisurely back through all that fire  | totally unscathed . He motioned furiously to Fife to hand him the phone , to take back up the call to Colonel Tall which Tella 's first screams had interrupted . Then , just as he was puckering to whistle , a large green object of nature on his right , a green boulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bellowing . Taking earthly matters into its own hands , it bounded over the crest of the fold growling guttural obscenities before Stein could even yell the one word , " Welsh ! " The First Sergeant was already careering at full gallop down into the hollow . Welsh saw everything before him with a singular , pristine , furiously crystal clarity : the rocky thin-grassed slope , mortar- and bulletpocked , the hot bright sunshine and deep cerulean sky , the incredibly white clouds above the towering highup horseshoe of the Elephant 's Head , the yellow serenity of the ridge before him . He did not know how he came to be doing this , nor why . He was simply furious , furious with a graven , black , bitter hatred of everything and everybody in the whole fucking gripeassed world . He felt nothing . Mindlessly , he ran . IIe looked curiously and indifferently , without participation , at the pulls of dirt which had begun now to kick up around him . Furious , furious . There were three bodies on the slope , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply had to stop that screaming ; it was n't dignified . Puffs of dirt were popping up all around him now . The clatterbanging which had hung in the air at varying levels all through the day had descended almost to ground level , now , and was aimed personally and explicitly at him . Welsh ran on , suppressing a desire to giggle . A curious ecstacy had gripped him . He was the target , the sole target . At last it was all out in the open . The truth had at last come out . He had always known it . Bellowing " Fuck you ! " at the whole world over and over at the top of his lungs , Welsh charged on happily . Catch me if you can ! Catch me if you can ! Zigzigging professionally , he made his run down . If a fucking nut like McCron could simply walk right out , a really bright man like himself in the possession of his faculties could get down and back . But when he skidded to a stop on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had made no plans about what to do when he got here . He was stumped , suddenly , and at a loss .  | And when he looked at Tella , an embarrassed kindliness came over him . Gently , still embarrassed , he touched the other on the shoulder . " How goes it , kid ? " he yelled inanely . In mid-scream Tella rolled his eyes around like a maddened horse until he could see who it was . He did not stop the scream . " You got to be quiet , " Welsh yelled , staring at him grimly . " I came to help you . " It had no reality to Welsh . Tella was dying , maybe it was real to Tella , but to Welsh it was n't real , the blueveined intestines , and the flies , the bloody hands , the blood running slowly from the other , newer wound in his chest whenever he breathed , it had no more reality for Welsh than a movie . He was John Wayne and Tella was John Agar . Finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Tella breathed , causing more blood to run from the hole in his chest . When he spoke , it was only a few decibels lower than the scream . " Fuck you ! " he piped . " I 'm dying ! I 'm dying , Sarge ! Look at me ! I 'm all apart ! Get away from me ! I 'm dying ! " Again he breathed , pushing fresh blood from his chest . " Okay , " Welsh yelled , " but goddam it , do it with less noise . " He was beginning to blink now , and his back to crawl , whenever a bullet flipped up dirt . " How you going to help me ? " " Take you back . " " You ca n't take me back ! You want to fucking help me , shoot me ! " Tella screamed , his eyes wide and rolling . " You 're off your rocker , " Welsh yelled in the noise . " You know I ca n't do that . " " Sure you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuck out ! You want to help me , shoot me and get it over with ! I ca n't stand it ! I 'm scared ! " " Does it hurt much ? " Welsh yelled . " Sure it hurts , you dumb son of a bitch ! " Tella screamed . Then he paused , to breathe , and bleed , and then he swallowed , his eyes closed . " You ca n't take me back . " " We 'll see , " Welsh yelled grimly . " You stick with old Welsh . Trust old Welsh . Did I ever give you a bum steer ? " He was aware  | now  --  he knew  --  that he would n't be able to stay much longer . Already he was flinching and jerking and jumping uncontrollably under the fire . Crouching he ran around to Tella 's head and got him under the armpits and heaved . In his own arms Welsh could feel the body stretch even before Tella screamed . " Aaa-eeeee ! " The scream was terrible . " You 're killing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down , goddam you ! Put me down ! " Welsh dropped him quickly , by simple reflex . Too quickly . Tella landed heavily , sobbing . " You son of a bitch ! You son of a bitch ! Leave me alone ! Leave me alone ! Do nt touch me ! " " Stop that yelling , " Welsh yelled , feeling abysmally stupid , " it ai nt dignified . " Blinking , his nerves already fluttering like fringe in a high wind now and threatening to forsake him , he scrambled grimly around to Tella 's side . " All right , we 'll do it this way , then . " Slipping one arm under the Italian 's knees and the other under his shoulders , he lifted . Tella was not a small man , but Welsh was bigger , and at the moment he was endowed with superhuman strength . But when he heaved him up to try and carry him like a child , the body jackknifed almost double like a closing pocketknife . Again there was that terrible scream . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're breaking me in two ! Put me down ! " This time Welsh was able to let him down slowly . Sobbing , Tella lay and vituperated him . " You son of a bitch ! You fucker ! You bastard ! I told you leave me alone ! I never ast you to come down here ! Go away ! Leave me alone ! You shiteater ! Stay away from me ! " And turning his head away and closing his eyes , he began his desperate , wailing , piercing scream again . Five yards above them on the slope a line of machinegun bullets slowly stitched itself across from left to right . Welsh happened to be looking straight at it and saw it . He did not even bother to think how all the gunner had to do was depress a degree . All he could think about now was getting out of here . And yet how could he ? He had come all this way down here . And he had not saved Tella , and he had not shut him up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With sudden , desperate inspiration he leaped across  | the prostrate Tella and began rummaging in the dead medic 's belt pouches , " Here ! " he bellowed . " Tella ! Take these ! Tella ! " Tella stopped screaming and opened his eyes . Welsh tossed him two morphine syrettes he had found and began to attack another pouch . Tella picked one up . " Morel " he cried when he saw what they were . " More ! Gim me more ! Morel " " Here , " Welsh yelled , and tossed him a double handful he had found in the other pouch , and then turned to run . But something stopped him . Crouched like a sprinter at the gun , he turned his head and looked at Tella one more time . Tella , already unscrewing the cap from one of the syrettes was looking at him , his eyes wide and white . For a moment they stared at each other . " Goodby , " Tella cried . " Goodby , Welsh ! " " Goodby , kid , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say . For that matter , it was all he had time to say , because he was already off and running . And he did not look back to see whether Tella took the syrettes . However , when they were able to get to him safely later in the afternoon , they found ten empty morphine syrettes scattered all around him . The eleventh remained stuck in his arm . He had taken them one after the other , and there was an at least partially relaxed look on his dead face . Welsh ran with his head down and did not bother to zigzag . He was thinking that now they would get him . After all of that , that run down , all that time down there , now they would have to get him , on the way back . It was his fate , his luck . He knew that they would get him now . But they did n't . He ran and ran and then he fell headlong over the little crest and just lay there , half dead from exhaustion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind his closed eyes . Why in the Name of Foolish Bastardly God had he ever done it in the first place ? Sobbing audibly for breath , he made himself a solemn unspoken promise never again to let his screwy wacked-up emotions get the better of his common sense . But it was when Bugger Stein crawled over to him to pat him on  | the back and congratulate and thank him , that Welsh really blew his top . " Sergeant , I saw the whole thing through the glasses , " he heard , feeling the friendly hand on his shoulder . " I want you to know I 'm mentioning you in Orders tomorrow . I 'm recommending you for the Silver Star . I can only say that I ? " Welsh opened his eyes and found himself staring up into the anxious Jewish face of his Commander . The look in his eyes must have stopped Stein , because he did not finish . " Captain , " Welsh said deliberately , between ebbing sobs for breath , " if you say one word to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nose . Right now , right here . And if you ever so much as mention me in your fucking Orders , I will resign my rating two minutes after , and leave you to run this pore , busted-up outfit by yourself . If I go to jail . So fucking help me . " He shut his eyes . Then as an afterthought he rolled over away from Bugger , who said nothing . As a second afterthought , he got to all fours and crawled away , off to the right , by himself . Shutting his eyes again , he lay in the sun-tinged dark , listening to the mortars that were still dropping every couple of minutes , groaning over and over to himself his one phrase of understanding : " Property ! Property ! All for fucking property ! " He was terribly dry , but both his canteens were bone empty . After a while he took out the third one and took one precious swallow of its precious gin without opening his eyes . The lack of water was getting to everyone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as empty as Welsh 's . And Stein had no gin . In addition , he still had his call to put through to Colonel Tall at Battalion CP . He was not looking forward to it , and Welsh 's reaction just now in crawling away from him like that was not especially heartening or confidence inspiring . Slowly he crawled back to Fife and the sound power phone . He understood that his crazy First Sergeant , mad or not , wanted to be alone . He must be terribly wrought up . After having just helped a mutilated man to kill himself ? And not even counting the danger to himself , to Welsh . His reaction was quite normal . But in spite of that , just for a moment , when Welsh had opened his eyes with that look  | and had said what he did , Bugger Stein could not escape a fleeting impression that it was because he Stein was Jewish . He thought he had gotten over all that sort of stuff long ago . Years and years ago . He made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just thought , and because of what he thought next : It was that fucking infuriating outrageous Anglo-Saxon Tall , with his cropped blond head and young-old boyish face , and his tall spare soldierly frame . West Point , class of ' 28 . Whenever Stein was forced by the duties of his military life to have contact with that commanding gentleman , Stein always somehow came away from it made doubly aware of being of Jehovah 's Own , a Jew . He motioned to Fife to give him the phone . When Stein took the phone , he received the extraordinary impression that his arm , his whole body , was too tired , too weak , to lift the almost weightless little tin instrument to his ear . Astonished , he waited . Slowly the arm came up . Already worn out , the affair of Tella 's death had taken more out of him than he realized . How long could he go on ? How much longer could he watch his men being killed in agony like this without ceasing to function entirely ? Suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he might not be able to cut it . This fear , added to the already heavy burden of simple physical fear for himself , seemed almost too much of a load to bear , but it jerked a renewed energy up out of some deep in him . He whistled into the mouthpiece . Scattered around him , as he whistled and waited , the mixed remnants of his CP force plus a smattering of 2d and 3d Platoon men lay huddled to earth , watching him with white eyes and those drawn in-turned faces , as if all were looking to him and hoping he could in some way get them out of this bind , this mess , so that they might go on living . Stein could grin , and did , at the looks on the faces of Storm and his cook force , which seemed to say clearly that they had had their fill of this volunteering for combat , that if they ever got out of this one they would most certainly never do it again . They were not alone in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same look . Stein did not have long to wait ; almost before his whistle had ended the phone was answered on the other end , and it was Colo-  | nel Tall himself , not any communications clerk . It was not a long conversation , but in a way it was one of the most important conversations in Stein 's life up to now . Yes , Tall had seen the little three squad attack , and had thought it fine . They had made a good lodgment . But before Stein could say anything further , he demanded to know why Stein had not already followed it up and exploited it ? What was the matter with him ? Those men should be reinforced immediately . And what were they doing ? Tall could see them through his glasses , just lying there behind that ledge . They should be already up and out and at work cleaning out those emplacements . " I do nt think you understand what 's going on down here , Sir , " Stein said patiently . " We 're taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy casualties . I was planning to reinforce them right away , but something bad happened . We had a man ? " he did not actually hesitate or gulp over the word , but he wanted to gulp ? " gutshot out on the slope , and he caused quite a bit of upset . But that 's taken care of now , and I 'm planning to reinforce now . " Stein swallowed . " Over ? " " Fine , " Colonel Tall 's voice said crisply , without his former enthusiasm . " By the way , who was that man who ran out on the slope ? Was that what he was doing ? The Admiral  --  Admiral Barr  --  saw him through the glasses ; the Admiral could n't tell for sure but thought he had gone out to help someone . Was that it ? The Admiral wants to recommend the man for something . Over . " Stein had listened wanting suddenly to laugh hysterically . Help him ? Yes , he had helped him all right . Boosted him right on off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were two men who went out , Sir , " he said . " One was our senior medic . He was killed . The other , " he said , remembering what he now thought of as his conspiratorial promise to Welsh , " was one of the privates . I do nt know which one yet , but I 'll find out . Over . " And fuck you . And the Admiral . Fine . Fine , fine . And now , Tall wanted to know , what about those reinforcements ? Stein went on to lay out , while the mortars continued to search unabated along and around the fold , his little plan of bringing his reserve platoon forward to this slope , while  | sending the remaining two squads of 2d Platoon up with the other three  --  other two now , rather , after casualties  --  up on the ridge . " I lost Keck , you know , too , Colonel . Up there . He was one of my best men , " he said . " Over . " The answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two squads ! What the hell did he mean , two squads ! When Tall said reinforcements , he meant reinforcements . Stein should throw every man he had in there , and should do it now . Should have done earlier , as soon as the lodgment was made . That meant commit the reserve platoon and all . And what about Stein 's 1st Platoon ? They were lying on their fat asses down there doing nothing . Stein should move them by the flank in to the ridge , should get a man down there to them right now with orders to attack  --  attack around the left of the ridge . Send his reserve platoon to attack around the right . Leave the 2d Platoon there to hold and press the center . An envelopment . " Do I have to give you a ten cent lesson in infantry tactics while your men are getting their ass shot off , Stein ? " Tall howled . " Over ! " Stein swallowed his wrath . " I do nt think you fully understand what 's going on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than he felt . " We 've already lost two officers dead , and a lot of men . I do nt think my company alone can take that position . They 're too well dug in , and have too much firepower . I formally request , Sir , and I have witnesses , to be given permission to make a patrol reconnaissance around to the right of Hill 210 through the jungle . I believe the entire position can be outflanked by a maneuver there in force . " But did he ? Did he really believe that ? Or was he only grasping at straws ? He had a hunch , that was the truth . He had a real hunch but that was all . There had been no fire from there all day . But was that enough ? " Over , " he said , trying to muster all his dignity  --  then blinked and ducked down flat , as a mortar shell went up roaring ten yards away along the little crest and somebody screamed . " NO ! " roared Tall , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dance of frustration at the other end , until he could push his button and speak his piece into this maddening one-way phone . " I tell you , no ! I want a double envelopment ! I order you , Stein , to  | attack , and attack now , with every available man at your disposal ! I 'm sending B-for-Baker in too on your left ! Now , ATTACK , Stein ! That 's a direct order ! " He paused for breath . " Over ! " Stein had heard himself talking of " formally request " and " have witnesses " with a sort of astonished , numb disbelief . He had not really meant to go that far . How could he be sure that he was right ? And yet , he was sure . At least , reasonably sure . Why had there been no firing from down there , then ? In any case , he had now either to put up or shut up . His heart suddenly up in his throat , he said formally , " Sir , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I again request permission to make a patrol reconnaissance in force around to the right . The time , Sir , is 1321 hours 25 seconds . I have two witnesses here listening to what I 've said . I request , Sir , that you inform witnesses there . Over . " " Stein ! " he heard . Tall was raging . " Do nt pull that guardhouse lawyer shit with me , Stein ! I know you 're a goddamned lawyer ! Now shut up and do like I said ! I did nt hear what you just said ! I repeat my order ! Over ! " " Colonel , I refuse to take my men up there in a frontal attack . It 's a suicide ! I 've lived with these men two and a half years . I wo n't order them all to their deaths . That 's final . Over . " Someone was blubbering now not far away along the crest , and Stein tried to see who it was and could n't . Tall was stupid , ambitious , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desperate to succeed before his superiors . Otherwise he could never have given such an order . After the little pause , Tall 's voice was cool , and sharp as a razorblade . " This is a very important decision you 're making , Stein . If you feel that strongly , perhaps you have reason . I 'm coming down . Understand : I 'm not rescinding my order to you , but if I find there are extenuating circumstances when I get down there , I 'll take that into account . I want you to hold on there until I get there . If possible , get those men up on the ridge out and moving . I 'll be there in " he paused " ten or fifteen minutes . Over and out . " Stein listened unbelieving , mentally stunned , feeling scared . To Stein 's knowledge , which he knew was not universal but nevertheless , no Battalion Commander had come forward with his fighting  | troops since this battle started and the division entered combat . Tall 's inordinate ambition was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the island here today to perform for , but Stein still had not anticipated this . What had he expected , then ? He had expected , if he made his protest strong enough , to be allowed to make his patrol in force and test the right before having to face a necessity of this frontal attack , ? even though he knew it was a little late in the day now for that kind of an operation . And now he was really scared . It was almost funny , how even lying here terrified and half-expecting to be dead at any moment , his bureaucratic fear of reprimand , of public embarrassment was stronger than his physical fear of dying . Well , at least as strong . Well , he had two things to do , while he waited for Tall . He must see about that man who was wounded a moment ago . And he must get the other two squads of 2d Platoon up there on the ridge to Beck and Dale . The wounded man proved to be little Pfc Bead from Iowa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The mortar round had exploded five yards away from him on his left , sending a piece probably no bigger than a silver dime into his left side after tearing its way through the triceps muscle of his upper left arm . The chunk out of his arm would never have killed him though it might have crippled him a bit , but blood was pouring from the hole in his side into the compresses somebody had stuck on it , and from the soaked gauze dripping down to stain the ground . When Stein arrived , trailed by the wide-eyed Fife with the telephone , Bead 's eyes were blank and he spoke just barely above a whisper . " I 'm dying , Captain ! " he croaked , rolling his eyes toward Stein . " I 'm dying ! Mel Me ! I 'm dying ! I 'm so scared ! " He closed his eyes for a moment and swallowed . " I was just laying there . And it hit me right in the side . Like somebody punched me . Did n't hurt much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " Just take it easy , son . Just take it easy , " Stein said in a kind of fruitless , bootless anguish . " Where 's Fife ? " Bead creaked , rolling his eyes . " Where 's Fife ? " " He 's right here , son . Right here , " Stein said . " Fife ! " He himself  | turned away , feeling like an old , old , useless man . Grandfather Stein . Fife had stopped behind the Captain , but now he crawled closer . There were two or three others clustered around Bead . He had not wanted to look ; at the same time he could not convince himself of the reality of it . Bead hit and dying . Someone like Tella , or Pvt Jockey Jacques , was different . But Bead , with whom he had worked so many days in the office , in the orderly room . Bead , with whom he had  --  His mind balked away from that . " I 'm here , " he said . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fife could not think of anything to say , either . " I know . Just take it easy . Just take it easy , Eddie , " he said , repeating Stein . He felt impelled to use Bead 's first name , something he had never done before . " Will you write my folks ? " Bead said . " I 'll write them . " " Tell them it did n't hurt me much . Tell them the truth . " " I 'll tell them . " " Hold my hand , Fife , " Bead croaked then . " Pin scared . " For a moment , a second , Fife hesitated . Homosexuality . Fagotism . Fairies . He did n't even think them . The act of hesitation was far below the level of conscious thought . Then , realizing with horror what he had done , was doing , he gripped Bead 's hand . Crawling closer , he slid his other arm under his shoulders , cradling him . He had begun to cry , more because he suddenly realized that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bead could call friend , than because Bead was dying . " I 've got it , " he said . " Squeeze , " Bead croaked . " Squeeze . " " I 'm squeezing . " " Oh , Fife ! " Bead cried . " Oh , Captain ! " His eyes did not go shut but they ceased to see . After a moment Fife put him down and crawled away by himself , weeping in terror , weeping in fear , weeping in sadness , hating himself . It was only five minutes after that that Fife himself was hit . Stein had followed him when he crawled away . He obviously did  | not fully understand Fife 's weeping . " Lie down somewhere for a little bit , son , " he said , and briefly patted his back . He had already taken the sound power phone from Fife when he sent him up to Bead , and now he said , " I 'll keep the phone for a few minutes myself . There wo n't be any calls coming in for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bitter smile . Fife , who had listened to the last call to Tall , had in fact been one of Stein 's two witnesses , knew what he meant , but he was in no condition or mood to make any answer . Dead . Dead . All dead . All dying . None left . Nothing left . He had come unstrung , and his unnerving was the worse because he was helpless , could do nothing , could say nothing . He must stay here . The mortar rounds had continued to drop at random points along the fold with strict regularity , all during the time it had taken Bead to die , all during the time after . It was amazing how few men they actually wounded or killed . But everyone 's face wore that same vague-eyed , terrorized , in-drawn look . Fife had seen an abandoned , yellowdirt hole a few yards off to his right and he crawled to this . It was hardly even a hole , really . Someone had scooped out with his hands , bayonet or entrenching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surface . Fife crouched flat in this and put his cheek to the mud . Slowly he stopped weeping and his eyes cleared , but as the other emotions , the sorrow , the shame , the selfhatred seeped out of him under the pressure of self-preservation , the fourth component , terror , seeped in to replace them until he was only a vessel completely filled with cowardice , fear and gutlessness . And that was the way he lay . This was war ? There was no superior test of strength here , no superb swordmanship , no bellowing Viking heroism , no expert marksmanship . This was only numbers . He was being killed for numbers . Why oh why had he not found and taken to himself that clerkish dcskjob far in the rear which he could have had ? He heard the soft " shu-u-u " of the mortarshell for perhaps half a second . There was not even time to connect it with himself and frighten him , before there was a huge sunburst roaring of an explosion almost on top of him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that someone screamed but did not know it was himself . As if seeing some dark film shown with insufficient illumi-  | nation , he had a misty picture of someone other than himself halfscrambling , half-blown to his feet and then dropping , hands to face in a stumbling , rolling fall down the slope . Then nothing . Dead ? Are we , that other one , is I ? am he ? Fife 's body came to rest rolling in the lap of a 3d Platoon man , who happened to be sitting up , his rifle in his lap . Tearing itself loose , it scrambled away on elbows and knees , hands still to the face . Then Fife returned to it and opened its eyes and saw that everything had become a red flowing haze . Through this swirling red he could see the comic , frightened face of the 3d Platoon man whose name was Train . Never was there a less likely , less soldierly looking soldier . Long fragile nose , chinless jaw , pimpsqueak mouth , huge myopic eyes staring forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit ? Am I hit ? " " Y-yes , " Train mumbled . " Y-you are . " He also stuttered . " In the head . " " Bad ? Is it bad ? " " I c-ca n't tell , " Train said . " Y-you 're h-bleeding from your h-head . " " Am I ? " Fife looked at his hands and found them completely covered with the wet red . He understood now that peculiar red haze . It was blood which flowing down through his eyebrows had gotten in his eyes . God , but it was red ! Then terror blossomed all through him like some ballooning great fungus , making his heart kick and his eyes go faint . Maybe he was dying , right now , right here . Gingerly he probed at his skull and found nothing . His fingers came away glistening red . He had no helmet and his glasses were gone . " I-it 's in the b-back , " Train offered . Fife probed again and found the tornup spot . It was in the center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ H-how d-do you f-feel ? " Train said fearfully . " I do nt know . It do nt hurt . Except when I touch it . " Still on hands and knees Fife had bent his head , so that the blood flowing into his eyebrows now dripped to the ground instead of into his eyes . He peered up at Train through this red rain . " C-can you w-walk ? " Train said .  | " I-I do nt know , " Fife said , and then suddenly realized that he was free . He did not have to stay here any more . He was released . He could simply get up and walk away  --  provided he was able ? with honor , without anyone being able to say he was a coward or courtmarshaling him or putting him to jail . His relief was so great he suddenly felt joyous despite the wound . " I think I better go back , " he said . " Do nt you ? " " Y-yes , " Train said , a little wistfully . " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important to say upon such a momentous occasion , but he failed . " Good luck , Train , " he managed finally . " Th-thanks , " Train said . Tentatively Fife stood up . His knees were shaky , but the prospect of getting out of here gave him a strength he might not otherwise have had . At first slowly , then more swiftly , he began to walk rearward with his head bent and his hands to his forehead to keep the still flowing blood from getting in his eyes . With each step he took his sense of joyous release increased , but keeping pace with it his sense of fear increased also . What if they got him now ? What if they hit him with something else now just when he was free to leave ? As much as he could , he hurried . He passed a number of 3d Platoon men lying prone with those terror-haunted , inward-looking faces , but they did not speak and neither did he . He did not take the longer route back the way they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took the direct one , walking straight along the hollow between the folds to the forward slope of Hill 209 . Only when he was halfway up the steep slope of Hill 209 did he think of the rest of the company , and pausing he turned and looked back to where they lay . He wanted to yell something to them , encouragment or something , but he knew that from here they could never hear him . When several sniper bullets kicked up dirt around him , he turned and pressed on to come over the crest and down into the crowded Battalion aid station on the other side . Just before he breasted the crest , he met a party of men coming down from it and recognized Colonel Tall . " Hold on , son , " the Colonel smiled at him . " Do nt let it get you down . You 'll be back with us soon . " At the aid station he remembered his one nearly full canteen and began to drink  | greedily , his hands still shaking . He was reasonably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got hit , Bugger Stein had just crawled away from him . Fife had crawled one way and Stein the other , to instruct the two remaining squads of 2d Platoon to advance and reinforce Beck and Dale on the grassy ridge . He might just as easily have crawled along with Fife and so have been there when the mortarshell landed . The element of chance in it was appalling . It frightened Stein . Anyway he was dead-beat tired and depressed , and scared . He had watched Fife stagger bloodily to the rear , but there was nothing he himself could do because he was already in the midst of instructing the two squads from 2d Platoon about what they were to do when they got to the ridge , and what they were to tell Beck  --  which was , mainly , that he was to get his ass out and moving and try to knock out some of those machineguns . None of them in the two squads looked very happy about their assignment , including the two sergeants , but they did not say anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earnestly , wishing there was something else , something important or serious , he could tell them . There wasn't. 1-Ie told them good luck and to go . This time , as he had the last , Bugger watched their run down through his glasses . He was astonished to see that this time not one man was hit . He was even more astonished , when he watched through the glasses as they worked their way up through the grass to the little waisthigh ledge , to see that here no one was shot down , either . Only then did his ears inform him of something they ought to have noticed earlier : the volume of the Japanese fire had diminished considerably since Sergeant Welsh 's run down to aid the mutilated Private Tella . When he raised his glasses to the ledge itself , as he did immediately , even before the first of the newcomers began to arrive , Stein was able to see why . Only about half of Beck 's little two squad force was visible there . The rest were gone . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent part of his group off raiding and , apparently , with some success . Lowering his glasses , Stein turned to look at George Band , who by now had appropriated glasses of his own somewhere ( Stein remembered  | Bill Whyte 's father had presented him with a fine pair as a parting gift ) , and who now was looking back at Stein with the same astonished look on his face that Stein knew he himself wore . For a long moment they simply looked at each other . Then , just as Stein was turning to the newly arrived replacement medics to tell them he thought they might cross over to pick up the wounded with some degree of safety now , a cool , calm voice behind him said , " Now , Stein ! " and he looked up to see Colonel Tall his Battalion commander walking leisurely toward him carrying beneath his arm the unadorned little bamboo baton he had carried there ever since Stein had known him . What Bugger Stein and Brass Band could not know was that Sergeant Beck the martinet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japanese machinegun emplacements in the last fifteen or twenty minutes , all at the cost of only one man killed and none wounded . Phlegmatic , sullen , dull and universally disliked , an unimaginative , do-it-like-the-book-says , dedicated professional of two previous enlistments , Milly Beck came to the fore here as perhaps no one else including his dead superior , Keck , could have done . Seeing that no reinforcements were immediately forthcoming , framing his dispositions exactly as he had been taught in the small units tactics course he had once taken at Fort Benning , he took advantage of the terrain to send six men around to the right of the ledge and six to the left under his two acting sergeants , Dale and Bell . The rest he kept with himself in the center readied to fire at whatever targets of opportunity turned up . Everything worked . Even the men he kept with himself were able to knock down two Japanese who were fleeing from the grenades of his patrols . Dale and his men on the left accounted for four emplacements and returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were able to crawl into the midst of the Japanese position and drop grenades from the ledge down into the rear doors of two covered , camouflaged emplacements they spotted below them ; the other two emplacements , on the uphill side , were more diflic'ult but by bypassing them and crawling up alongside they were able to pitch grenades into the apertures . Not a single one of them was even fired at . They returned led by the grinning Dale licking his lips and smacking his  | chops over his success . The importance of their accomplishment was to cut down by at least fifty percent the firepower which could be directed from the left of the ridge down upon the 1st Platoon or into the flat which their reinforcements later crossed in safety . Bell on the right was not so lucky , but he discovered something of great importance . On the right the ledge slowly graded upwards , and after bypassing and grenading one small emplacement below them Bell and his group came upon the main Japanese strongpoint of the whole position . Here the ledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became a real cliff and was impassable . Just above this rock wall , beautifully dug in and with apertures in three directions , was the Japanese strongpoint . When the lead man climbed out above the ledge to detour around the rock wall , he was riddled fatally by at least three machineguns . Both Witt the volunteer Kentuckian and Pfc Doll were in Bell 's party , but neither of them happened to be the lead man . This distinction was reserved for a man named Catch , Lemuel C Catch , an oldtime regular and drunkard and a former boxing friend of Witt 's . Iie died immediately and without a sound . They pulled his body clown and retreated with it , while all hell broke loose tiring just above their heads , but not before  --  further back along the ledge  --  Acting Sergeant Bell got a good look at the strongpoint so he could describe it . Why he did it even Bell himself never knew . Most probably it was sheer bitterness and fatigue and a desire , to get this goddamned fucking battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very least an accurate , eyewitness description of it might prove valuable later on . Whatever the reasons , it was a crazy thing to do . Halting his men thirty-five to forty yards back from the rockwall where Catch had died , Bell told them to wait and indulged himself in his crazy desire to look too . Leaving his rifle , holding a grenade in one hand , he climbed up the little ledge and poked up his head . The Japanese firing all had stopped now , and there was a little scrub on the lip of the ledge here , which was why he chose it . Slowly he climbed up , led on by whatever insane , mad motive , until he was out in the open , lying in a tiny little defiladed place . All he could see was the unending grass , rising slowly along a hillock which stuck up out of the ridge . Pulling the pin , he heaved the grenade with all  | his strength and ducked down . The grenade fell and exploded just in front of the hillock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bell was able to count five guns in five spitting apertures which he could not see before . When the firing ceased , he crawled back down to his men , obscurely satisfied . Whatever it was that made him do it , and he still did n't know , it made every man in his little group look at him admiringly . Motioning them on , he led them back down and around the ledge until the company 's main position at the third fold hove into view . From there on it was easy to get back . Like Dale 's group , they did not see or hear a single Japanese anywhere near the ledge . Why the ledge , which was the real key to the whole position on the ridge , had been left totally unguarded by riflemen or MGs , no one ever found out . It was lucky for both groups , as well as for Beck 's miniscule little attack plan , that it was unguarded . As it was , they had cleaned out all the Japanese below the ledge and established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That they changed the entire situation almost exactly at the precise moment Colonel Tall walked on the field was one of those happenstancical ironies which occur , which are entirely unpredictable , and which seem to be destined to dog the steps of certain men named Stein . " What are you doing lying down there where you ca n't see anything ? " was the next thing Tall said . He himself was standing upright but , because he was ten or twelve yards away , only his head and the tips of his shoulders , if anything of him at all , showed above the crest . Stein noticed he apparently had no inclination to come closer . Stein debated whether to tell him that the situation had changed . Almost in the last few seconds before his arrival . But he decided not to . Not just yet . It would look too much like an excuse , and a lame one . So instead he answered , " Observing , Sir . I just sent the other two squads of my 2d Platoon forward to the ridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming along , " Tall nodded . The rest of his party , Stein noted , which included three privates as runners , his personal sergeant and a young Captain named Gaff , his Battalion Exec , had decided that it might be just as well to be  | lying down flat on the ground . " How many of them were hit this time ? " Right to the point , it was . " None , Sir . " Tall raised his eyebrows under the helmet which sat so low on his small , fine head . " None ? Not one ? " A mortar round mushroomed exploding dirt without hurting anybody somewhere along the rearward slope of the third fold , and Tall coming forward to where Stein lay permitted himself to squat on his haunches . " No , Sir . " " That does n't sound much like the situation you described to me over the sound power . " Tall squinted at him , his face reserved . " It 's not , Sir . The situation 's changed . " Stein felt he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last four or five minutes , " he added , and detested himself . " And to what do you attribute the change ? " " Sergeant Beck , sir . When I last looked , half of his men had disappeared . I think he sent them off to try and knock out some emplacements , and they seem to have succeeded . " From somewhere far off a machinegun began to rattle and a long line of bullets struck up dirt twenty-five yards below them on the forward slope . Tall did not change his squatting position or alter his voice . " Then you got my message to him . " " No , Sir . I mean , yes , Sir , I did . It went forward with the two new squads . But Beck had already sent his men off before they got there . Some time before . " " I see . " Tall turned his head and squinted his blue eyes off at the grassy ridge in silence . The long line of MG bullets came sweeping back from Stein 's left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not move . " They 've seen you , Sir , " Stein said . " Stein , we 're going over there , " Tall said , ignoring his remark , " all of us , and we 're taking everybody with us . Do you have any more formal complaints or demurrers ? " " No , Sir , " Stein said lamely . " Not now . But I reiterate my request to take a patrol down into the jungle on the right . I 'm convinced it 's open down there . There has n't been a shot fired from there all day . A Jap patrol could have infiladed the hell out of us from there  | with very little trouble . I was anticipating it . " He pointed away down the hollow between the folds to where the tree tops of the jungle were just barely visible , while Tall followed his gaze . " In any case , " Tall said , " it 's now too late in the day to send a patrol down there . " " A patrol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They could make a perimeter defense if they did n't get back before dark . " " Do you want to lose a platoon ? Anyway , you 're emptying your center . We do nt have A-for-Able in reserve , Stein . They 're off on your right rear fighting their own fight . B-for-Baker is our reserve , and they 're committed on your left . " " I know that , Sir . " " No , we 'll do it my way . We 'll take everybody over to the ledge . We may be able to take that ridge before nightfall . " " I think that ridge is quite a way from being reduced , Sir , " Stein said earnestly , and adjusted his glasses , the four fingers on the frame above , the thumb below . " I do nt think so . In any case , we can always make a perimeter defense for the night there . Rather than withdraw like yesterday . " The conference was over . Leisurely Tall stood up to his full height . Again the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bullets struck the ground a few feet from him as Stein ducked , the bullets seeming , at least to Stein , to go whining off all about Tall 's feet and between his legs . Tall gave the ridge one contemptuous amused look and started walking down the rearward slope still talking to Stein . " But first I want you to get a man down there to your ist Platoon and move them by the flank over to the ridge . They are to take up position behind the ledge and extend the left flank from Beck 's left . As soon as a man reaches your ist Platoon safely , I 'll sound power Baker to move out , and then we 'll move . " " Yes , Sir , " Stein said . He was unable to keep his teeth from grinding , but his voice was level . Slowly , very slowly , because he was reluctant , he too stood up to his full height also , then followed Tall down the slope . But before he could give an order young Captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had already crawled up to them . " I 'll go , Sir , " he said to Tall . " I 'd like to . Very much . "  | Tall gazed at him fondly . " All right , John . Go ahead . " With strong fatherly pride he watched the young captain move away . " Good man , my young Exec , " he said to Stein . There was really no need for the glasses this time . 1st Platoon was n't all that far away . Standing upright , their heads just showing above the crest , Tall and Stein watched Gaff zigzag his way professionally down into the shellhole area on the main flat to the left of the grassy ridge . Stein had told him roughly where to find Skinny Culn , now platoon commander by attrition . In a few moments men began moving to the right in rushes , by twos and threes . " All right , " Tall said . " Give me the sound power . " He spoke into it at length . " Okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Around them , as if sensing something or other was in the wind , the men began to stir . Whatever else Stein could find to say about him , and Stein could find plenty , he nevertheless had to admit that with Tall 's arrival on the battlefield a change for the better had come over everything and everybody . Partly of course the change was due to Beck 's feat , whatever that was exactly . But it could not all be that , and Stein had to admit it . Tall had brought with him some quality that had not been here before , and it showed in the faces of the men . They were less in-drawn looking . Perhaps it was only the feeling that after all in the end not everybody would die . Some would live through it . And from there it was only a step to the normal reaction of ego : I will live through this . Others may get it , my friends right and left may die , but I will make it . Even Stein felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and had taken it firmly and surely and with confidence . Those who lived would owe it to Tall , and those who died would say nothing . It was too bad about those ones ; everybody would feel that ; but after all once they were dead they did not really count anymore , did they ? This was the simple truth , and Tall had brought it with him to them . The whole thing was evident in the way Tall handled the move forward . Striding up and down in front of the prone 3d Platoon , his little bamboo baton in his right hand , tapping it lightly against his shoulder as he frowned in concentration , he explained to them briefly what he planned to do , and why , and what their part in it  | must be . He did not exhort them . His attitude said quite plainly that he considered any exhortation to be cheating and trickery and he would not indulge in it ; they deserved better than that ; they must do what they must do , and do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be no jingoism . When the move was completed and both 1st and 3d Platoons were installed behind the ledge to the left and right of the 2d , only two men had been wounded and these lightly , and everybody knew they owed this to Colonel Tall . Even Stein felt the same way . But having got them that far , it was evident that even Tall was not going to get them very much further . It was now after threethirty . They had been out here since dawn , and most of them had not had any water since mid-morning . Several men had collapsed . Nerves frayed by being almost constantly under fire and without water , many more were hysterically close to collapse . Tall could see all this himself . But after taking the reports of Beck , Dale and Bell , he wanted to have , before dark , one more go at reducing the strongpoint on the right . The little assemblage of officers and noncoms around the Colonel now included those of B-for-Baker . When Charlie Co was making its move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had made its third attack of the day . Like the others it too had failed , and in the confusion half of Baker had overlapped Charlie 's 1st Platoon on the left and hung there . In returning the rest had tumbled in and stayed there also , so Tall had sent for their leaders , too . " That strongpoint is obviously the key to the ridge , " he now said to the whole of them . " Se  --  uh  --  Sergeant Bell here is quite right . " He gave Bell a sharp look and went on , " From their knob there our little brown brothers can cover the whole of the flat rising ground in front of our ledge from our right clear over to Baker on the left . Why they left the ledge unguarded I have no idea . But we must exploit it before they see their error . If we can reduce that big bunker , I see no reason why we ca n't take the whole ridge before nightfall . I 'm asking for volunteers to go back there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time this news about a further attack , was so horrified he could hardly believe his ears . Surely Tall must  | know how depleted and worn out they all were . But Stein 's impetus to argue with Tall had worn out , especially in front of over half the Battalion officers . To John Bell , squatting with the others , it was all once again like some scene from a movie , a very bad , cliche , third rate war movie . It could hardly have anything to do with death . The Colonel still remained fully upright , still paced back and forth with his bamboo baton as he talked , but Bell noted that he carefully remained far enough back down the slope so that his head did not show above the ledge . Bell had also noted the hesitation and then italicized pronunciation when Tall applied the title Sergeant to himself . This was the first time Bell had ever met his Colonel , but there was no reason to assume Tall did not also know his story . Everybody else knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else , which made him say what he said . " Sir , I 'll be glad to go back again and lead the way for a party . " Was he mad ? He was angry , he knew that , but was he insane as well ? Ah , Marty ! Immediately , off to Bell 's right , another voice piped up . Hunchshouldered , grapplehanded , crackfaced , Acting Sergeant Dale was making his bid for future fame , future sinecures , future security from army kitchens . For whatever it was that drove him . Bell did not know . " I 'll go , Colonel , Sir ! I want to volunteer ! " Charlie Dale stood up , made three formal paces forward , then squatted again . It was as if Dale , the liberated cook , did not believe his offer legal without the prescribed three paces forward . From his squat he glanced all around , his beady little eyes bright with something . To Bell the effect was distastefully ludicrous , laughable . Almost before Dale had squatted , two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the privates and within the remnant of his own little patrol group , Pfc Doll and Private Witt came forward . Both sat down , much closer to Bell than to Dale who still squatted by himself . Bell felt impelled to wink at them . Pfc Doll , who was still outraged over the success of Charlie Dale 's patrol as against their own , was startled by Bell 's wink . Why the fuck would anybody want to wink ? From the moment he spoke  | and started to move forward Doll had felt his heart in his throat again , making his eyes swim dizzily . Moving his tongue in his mouth was like rubbing two damp pieces of blotting paper together . He had had no water for over four hours , and thirst had become so much a part of him that he could not remember ever having been without it . But this other was extra , this blotting paper in his mouth was the thirst of fear , and Doll recognized it . Was Bell ridiculing him ? He essayed a small cold guarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting relaxed to the left of Doll and a little nearer to Bell , grinned and winked back . Witt was at ease . He had made up his mind , when he first volunteered himself back into the old company this morning , to go through with it all the way . And that was what he intended to do . When Witt made up his mind , it was made up , and that was that . As far as he was concerned this volunteer mission was only another little chore to be got through and done by a few men of talent like himself . He had enough confidence in himself as a soldier to be pretty sure he could take care of himself in any situation requiring skill ; and as for accidents or bad luck , if one of those caught him , well , it caught him , and that was that . But he did n't believe one would , and in the meantime he was sure he could help out , perhaps save a lot of his old buddies  --  some of whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted him to come back in the outfit . But Witt wanted to help , or save as many of them as he could , even Fife if it had happened like that . Then , besides all of this , Witt had acquired considerable respect and admiration for Bell earlier , on the patrol when Bell pulled his stunt of exposing himself like he had . Witt , who had been a corporal three times and a sergeant : twice ( luring his career , could appreciate intelligence and courage irr a man . And , despite the fact that he was chary of his personal endorsements , he now liked Bell . Witt felt that , like himself , Bell had the qualities of real leadership . Together they might do a lot , help , or save , a lot of guys . He liked Bell exofficer or not . So he grinned and winked back his feeling of kinship , before turning his attention back to Tall , whom Colonel or not he did not like . The Colonel had had no chance to speak , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He now had four . And before he could say anything to the four , he acquired three more in rapid succession . A rather elderly , Calvinistic-looking 2d Lieutenant , who might well have been a Chaplain but was not , presented himself from amongst the B Company officers . A B Company sergeant followed him . Then Tall 's own Exec , young Captain Gaff , put in his two cents and offered his services . " I 'd like to lead the party , Colonel , " he said . Tall held up his hand . " That 's enough , that 's enough . Seven is plenty . In the terrain you 'll be working more men would only hinder you , I think . I know many more of you would like to go , but you 'll have to wait for another opportunity . " Captain Stein , hearing this , peered at his Commander closely through his glasses , and was amazed to see that Tall was in deadly earnest and not joking at all . He was not even being ironic . Turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John . It 's your baby . You 'll be in command . Now ... " Professionally , he laid out their operation for them . Succinctly , efficiently , missing no smallest detail or advantage , he planned their tactics . It was impossible not to admire both his ability and his command of it . Stein for one , and he was sure lie was not alone , was forced to admit that here in Ta11 was a talent and an authority which he himself just simply did not possess . " Almost certainly you will find the bunker guarded by smaller MG posts around it . But I think it is better to ignore these and go for the strongpoint itself if you possibly can . The little posts will fall of themselves if the big one is taken ; remember that . " That 's all , gentlemen , " Tall said with a sudden smile . " Noncoms return to your positions , but I want the officers to remain . Synchronize watches with me , John . Give Dog Co  --  oh  --  twelve minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you that long to get there . " As the little assault party crawled off to the right along the ledge , Colonel Tall was already on the sound power phone to contact Battalion . Captain Stein , squatting with the officers who had been told to stay and looking over at his own waterless exhausted men behind the ledge , could not help wondering just how far uphill  | they would be able to attack , even if the strongpoint fell ? Thirty yards maybe ? before they collapsed ? The assault party disappeared around the corner of the hillside . Stein turned his attention back to Tall and the little group of company officers , of whom only six remained now out of ten . And as the assault party approached the spot where Bell earlier had exposed himself , Colonel Tall was already explaining to his officers his auxiliary plan , should the assault on the bunker fail . If that happened , Tall wanted to effect a surprise night attack . Of course that would mean setting up a perimeter defense first , so they should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as 2d Battalion had done yesterday . He himself would stay with the Battalion . In the meantime of course there was always the chance , the off chance , that the assault party would succeed . John Bell , crawling along in the lead of the little seven-man assault group , did not concern himself with whether the attack could succeed . He kept thinking only that he had volunteered to lead a party back . He had not volunteered to be a fighting part of it . But no one except himself had paid the slightest attention to this nicety of phrasing . Now here he was , not only leading them as point , but expected to fight with them , and unable to back out without looking cowardly , schmucky . Pride ! Pride ! What stupid foolish things it forced us to do in its goddam fucking name ! He kept his eyes glued on that changing point where the ledge disappeared around the curve of the hillside . It would be just his goddamned luck to find the Japanese had suddenly decided to correct their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ledge . He as the point would be the first big fat target . Irritably , he glanced back to motion the others to come on and in doing so discovered something strange . Ile no longer cared very much . He no longer cared at all . Exhaustion , hunger , thirst , dirt , the fatigue of perpetual fear , weakness from lack of water , bruises , danger had all taken their toll of him until somewhere within the last few minutes ? Bell did not know exactly when  --  he had ceased to feel human . So much of so many different emotions had been drained from him that his emotional reservoir was empty . He still felt fear , but even that was so dulled by emotional apathy ( as distinct from physical  | apathy ) that it was hardly more than vaguely unpleasant . He just no longer cared much about anything . And instead of impairing his ability to function , it enhanced it , this sense of no longer feeling human . When the others came up , he crawled on whistling over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tune of God Bless America . They thought they were men . They all thought they were real people . They really did . How funny . They thought they made decisions and ran their own lives , and proudly called themselves free individual human beings . The truth was they were here , and they were gon na stay here , until the state through some other automaton told them to go someplace else , and then they 'd go . But they 'd go freely , of their own free choice and will , because they were free individual human beings . Well , well . When he reached the spot where he had crawled out above the ledge he stopped and sending Witt ahead to guard , pointed the place out to Captain Gaff . Witt , when he crawled out to take the point  --  or post rather , it was , since they were no longer moving  --  did think he was a man , and did believe he was a real person . As a matter of fact , the question had never entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself back into the old outfit , and he had made his decision to volunteer for this thing , and he was a free individual human being as far as he was concerned . He was free , white and twenty-one and had never taken no shit off nobody and never would , and as the prospect of action got closer and closer he could feel himself tightening all up inside with excitement , exactly like he used to do in the coal strikes back in Bloody Breathitt . The chance to help , the chance to save all his friends that he could , the chance to kill some more goddam fucking Japanese , he would show that fucking Bugger Stein who had had him transferred out as a malcontent . Standing on his knees out away from the ledge , he held his rifle ready with the safety off . He had not shot squirrel all his life for nothing , he had not made High Expert on the range for the past six years for nothing , either . His only fear was that something might open up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mind , while he was out here on point  --  on post ,  | rather  --  and could not get into it . Well , they would know soon enough . And Witt was right . They did know soon enough . After he had been shown the spot , young Captain Gaff , who if he was nervous at all hid it to perfection , decided to crawl out for a look himself and after he returned , decided that this was as good a spot to observe the fire as any . The only trouble was that the tiny low place with its thin short brush cover was too low to allow him to drag the walkie-talkie up there above the ledge . " Any of you guys know how to operate this thing ? " he asked . Bell was the only one who did . " Okay , you stay below the ledge and I 'll call down the data to you from up above , " Gaff said . First though he would call them and set up the coordinates himself . Then he explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much as they were able , he and his trusty band would crawl out along the low place until they formed a line , then they would try to crawl as close as they could through the grass before throwing their grenades . " Okay ? " Bell 's automatons all nodded their heads . " Okay . Then here we go . " Gaff crawled out into the low place before the first shells arrived . They could hear their soft shu-shu-shu coming almost straight down before they hit , then the hillside exploded into smoke and flame and noise . Only about fifty yards from the bunker , they were showered with a rain of dirt , chips of rock and small pieces of hot metal . Someone had motioned Witt in against the wall of the ledge , and they all clung to it with their faces pressed against the sharp rock and their eyes closed , cursing with hatred the goddamned fucking mortarmen because they might drop a short round , though they did n't . After fifteen minutes of this , ( luring which Gaff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down , " Okay ! Tell them to stop ! " Bell did . " I think that 's enough ! " Gaff yelled down . " Whatever damage they can do , they 've done by now . " Then , as the command was executed back there far away , the mortars stopped falling in a silence that was almost as devastating as the noise had been . " Okay , " Gaff called much more softly , " let 's go ! " If they were under any hopeful illusion that the mortar barrage had smashed and flattened every Japanese in the strongpoint , they  | were straightened out on this point right away . As the elderly , morose , Calvinistic-looking 2d Lieutenant from B-for-Baker climbed out first , he foolishly climbed straight up exposing himself to the waist , whereupon a Japanese machine gunner immediately shot him three times through the chest . He fell down flat on his face in the little trough , as he should have been in the first place , and hung there , his legs dangling straight down against the ledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and as gently as they could , they pulled him back down behind the ledge . Stretched out on his back with his eyes shut and breathing shallowly , he looked more morose than ever . He did not open his eyes and put both hands up over his damaged chest and went on breathing shallowly , sour-visaged , Calvinistic , his blue jowls shining darkly in the late afternoon sun . " Well , whadda we do now ? " Charlie Dale snarled . " We ca n't take him with us . " " We 'll have to leave him , " Witt said . He had just come up . " You ca n't leave him here , " the Baker Company sergeant protested . " Okay , " Dale snarled . " He 's from your company . You stay with him . " " Nah , " the Baker Company sergeant said . " I did n't volunteer for this thing just to sit with him . " " I should have been a Chaplain , " the dying man said in a faint voice without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . I 'm an ordained minister . I never should have fooled around with Infantry . My wife told me . " " We can leave him and pick him up on the way back , " Bell said . " If he 's still alive . " " You boys want to pray with me ? " the Lieutenant said , his eyes still closed . " Our Father Who art in Heaven , Hallowed be Thy Name . " " We ca n't , Sir , " Dale interrupted politely . " We got to get going . The Captain 's waitin on us . " " All right , " the Lieutenant said , still without opening his eyes . " I 'll do it myself . You boys go ahead . Thy Kingdom come , Thy Will be done , on earth as it is in Heaven . Give us this day our daily ... "  | As they climbed out one by one on their faces and bellies so as not to make the same mistake he made , the faint voice droned feebly on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The son of a bitch , " Witt whispered when they were both in the trough behind the thin fragile screen of leaves . " I wish he had of been a Chaplain . They 've seen us now . They know we 're here . It 's going to be hell . " " Yeh , fuck his goddam prayin , " Dale said , but he did not say it with much force . He was too busy looking all around everywhere , eyes wide with tension . Bell was the last to go , but he stopped at the ledge feeling he ought to say something , some word of encouragement , except what did you say to a man dying ? " Well , good luck , Sir , " he managed finally . " Thanks , son , " the Baker Company Lieutenant said without opening his eyes . " Which one are you ? I do nt want to open my eyes if I can help it . " " I 'm Bell , Sir . " " Oh , yes , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance , maybe you can say some little prayer for my soul . I do nt want to embarrass you . But it certainly ca n't do my soul no harm , can it ? " " Okay , Sir , " Bell said . " Goodby . " As he climbed out , pressing his face and chest as hard into the dirt of the trough as he could , the faint voice went droning feebly on , repeating some other kind of prayer now which Bell had never heard and did n't know . Automatons . Religious automatons , irreligious automatons . The Business and Professional Automatons Club , Chaplain Gray will give the benediction . Yes , siree . The dirt tasted very dusty in his mouth that was pressed to it . Captain Gaff , the Battalion Exec , had crawled completely to the end of the trough and out beyond the tiny little brush screen , a matter of twenty or thirty yards . " Is he dead ? " he asked when the others reached him . They were now strung out single file one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Dale whispered from immediately behind him . Out here beyond the litle screen of brush they were more in the open , though the trough still hid them , but here the grass was much  | thicker than back near the ledge , and it was here that Gaff had decided to make his move . They were to turn their little line by its right flank , he informed Dale and Witt behind him , and told them to pass it back , and on his signal begin to crawl , out of the trough and through the grass , toward the bunker . They were not to fire or throw their grenades until he gave the signal . He wanted to get as close to the bunker as possible without being seen . " Actually , " he pointed out to Dale behind him , " we could go straight on here . You see ? After that little open space we would be behind that little rise , and I think we could maybe crawl all the way around behind them . " " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nt think there 's that much time . " " Yes , Sir , " Dale said . " That would take at least another hour of crawling , " Gaff said earnestly . " And I 'm afraid it 's too near dark . " " Yes , Sir , " Dale said . " What do you think ? " Gaff said . " I agree with you , Sir , " Dale said . No fuckin officer was goin to get Charlie Dale to take no responsibility for what the officer done . " Has everybody behind been informed ? " Gaff whispered . " Yes , Sir . " Gaff sighed . " Okay . Let 's do it . " Slowly Gaff snaked his belly over the lip of the trough and off into the grass , dragging his rifle by the muzzle rather than cradling it , so as not to disturb the grass more than absolutely necessary . One by one the others followed . For John Bell it was like some insane , mad nightmare which he could remember having had before . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of old dead stems , catching and holding him . Dust and seeds filled his nose and choked him . Stems whipped his face . Then he remembered : it was that crawl up through the grass to the ledge with Keck . It really had happened to him after all . And Keck was dead now . None of them ever knew what set them off . One moment they were crawling along in utter silence , each man totally alone and separate and out of contact with the others , and in the next ma-  | chinegun fire was whipping and slashing over and around and all about them . No one had fired , no one had thrown a grenade , no one had shown himself . Perhaps one nervous enemy had seen some grass move and had fired , thus setting them all off . Whatever it was , they now lay in a storm of fire , separated and cut off from contact with each other , unable to take concerted action . Each man put his head down and huddled to the ground , praying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Contact was lost and with it all command and control . Nobody could move . And it was in this static situation of potential total loss that Pfc Don Doll came forward as hero . Sweating , lying pressed flat in an ecstasy of panic , terror , fear and cowardice , Doll simply could not stand it any longer . He had had too much this day . Wailing over and over in a high falsetto the one word " Mother ! Mother ! " , which fortunately nobody at all could hear , least of all himself , he leaped to his feet and began to run straight at the Japanese emplacement , firing his rifle from his hip at the one embrasure he could see . As if startled beyond reasonable expectation , most of the Japanese fire stopped suddenly . At the same moment Captain Gaff , released from his own temporary panic , leaped up waving his arm and bawling " Back ! " With him in the lead the rest of the assault force ran for the trough and their lives . Meanwhile Doll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mother ! " When his rifle was empty , he threw it at the embrasure , drew his pistol and began firing that . With his left hand he tore a grenade from his belt , stopped firing the pistol long enough to pull the pin with one finger , and lobbed the grenade over onto the camouflaged roof of the emplacement , which he could now see clearly since it was only about twenty yards away , and where the grenade exploded uselessly and without effect . Then , continuing to fire the pistol , he charged on . Only when the pistol ceased to fire for want of ammunition did he come to his senses and realize where he was . Then he turned and ran . Luckily for him , he did not turn back toward the others but simply ran blindly off to the right  --  though he would deny this later . In that direction the curving ledge was only ten yards away , and he reached it before the  | mass of the Japanese fire , which by now as if getting over its start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . From behind him as he ran the ten yards a dark round fizzing object arched over his head and fell a few feet in front of him . Automatically Doll kicked at it with his foot as if placekicking a football and ran on . It bounced away a few yards and exploded in a cloud of black smoke which knocked him down . But when he fell he found that there was nothing under him ; he had fallen over the ledge . His foot stinging painfully , he bounced to the foot of the ledge at almost the exact spot where Private Catch had been killed , landed with a bonejarring thud , then rolled another twelve yards further down the hillside before he could get himself stopped . For a while he just lay in the grass , breathing in groans , bruised , sore , the wind knocked out of him , half-blinded , thinking dully of almost nothing . This one had not been like his other experiences : the zigzag run back from 1st Platoon , then the return to find Skinny Cuin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This one had been horrible , totally and completely horrible , without any relieving qualities or graces . He devoutly hoped he would never have even to think of it again . When he looked at his shoe , he found a neat little slit a sixteenth of an inch long just above the ankle bone . Where the fuck was he , anyway ? He knew where he was , but was he alone ? What had happened to the others ? Where were they ? At the moment all he could think about was that he wanted to be with people , so he could put his arms around somebody and they could put their arms around him . With this in mind he got up , climbed to the ledge and ran gasping back along it till he came to the trough , where he almost ran headon into the others , all sitting against the rock and gasping breathlessly . Only one of them , the Sergeant from Baker Company , had been hurt , and he had had his shoulder smashed by an MG bullet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doll could apologize , make excuses or explain away what he had done , " I 'm personally recommending you to Colonel Tall for the Distinguished Service Cross . You saved all our lives , and I never saw such bravery . I shall write the recommendation myself , and I shall pursue it . I promise you . " Doll could hardly believe his own ears . " Well , Sir , it was n't  | nothin , " he gasped modestly . " I was scared . " He could see Charlie Dale looking at him with a kind of hate-filled envy from where he leaned gasping against the ledge . Ha , you fucker ! Doll thought with a sudden explosion of pleasure . " But to have the presence of mind to remember that the ledge was ten yards off there to the right , " Gaff gasped , " that was wonderful . " " Well , Sir , you know , I was with the first patrol , " Doll said and smiled at Dale . " So were some of these others , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but beginning to get his breath back . " Are you okay ? You 're not hurt ? " " Well , Sir , I do nt know , " Doll smiled , and proceeded to show them the tiny slit in his boot . " What 's that from ? " " A Jap handgrenade . I kicked it away . " He bent to unlace the shoe . " I better look . " Inside he found the little piece of metal , which had slipped to the bottom of his shoe like a pebble , but in actual truth he had not even felt it during the run back along the ledge . " Hunh ! " he lied , laughing . " I thought I had a rock in my shoe . " It had struck his anklebone just above its peak and cut it slightly ; it had bled a little into his sweat-wet sock . " By God ! " Gaff exclaimed . " It 's only a scratch , but by God I 'm recommending you for the Purple Heart , too . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right except for that ? " " I lost my rifle , " Doll said . " Take Lieutenant Gray 's , " Gaff said . He looked around at the others . " We better be getting back . And tell them we could n't take the objective . Can a couple of you drag Lieutenant Gray ? " Gaff turned to the Baker Company sergeant . " You all right ? Think you can make it ? " " I 'm all right , " the Baker Co sergeant said with a grin that was more a pained grimace . " It only hurts when I laugh . But I want to thank you ! " he said , turning to Doll " Do n't thank me , " Doll said , and laughed shyly , brilliant eyed , with a new magnanimity born of his sudden recognition . He had forgotten all about wanting to put his arms around somebody , or  | have them put their arms around him . " But what about you ? Are you going to be all right ? " He looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the arm hung useless against the sergeant 's side , and suddenly he was scared again . " Sure , sure , " the sergeant said happily . " I 'm out of it now . I 'll be going back . I hope I 'm crippled a little . " " Come on , you guys , " Captain Gaff said . " Let 's move . You can talk it over later . Dale , you and Witt drag Lieutenant Gray . Bell , you help the sergeant . I 'll take the walkie-talkie . Doll , you rearguard us . Them little brown brothers , as the Colonel likes to call them , are liable to send some people down here after us , you know . " And thus arranged the little party made its way back . The Japanese sent no one after them . Gaff with the radio , Bell and the B-for-Baker sergeant behind him , then Dale and Witt dragging the dead lieutenant 's body by its two feet , with Doll bringing up the rear , they did not make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into view of the Battalion . But Gaff had been talking to them on the way back . " If we do get another chance at it tomorrow , I think we can take it , " he said , " and I for one am going to volunteer for the assignment . If we crawl on across that open space and get behind the little rise , we can come around in behind them and come down on them from above . That 's what we should have done today . From above like that we can put the grenades to them easier than hell . And that 's what I 'm going to tell the Colonel . " And strangely enough , there was not one of them but who wanted to go back with him  --  excepting of course the Baker Company sergeant who of course could not go . Even John Bell wanted to go , just like all the others . Automatons all . What was it ? Why ? Bell did not know . What was this peculiar masochistic , self-destructive quality in himself which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expose himself to danger and gunfire as he had that first time at the trough ? Once as a child ? ( once ? many times , and in many different ways , but this one particular time when he was fifteen , and the memory assailed him now so strongly that it was as if he were actually there , living it again ) ? once he had gone for a tramp in one of the Ohio woods outside his town . This particular  | woods had a cliff and a cave , if you could call a hole four feet deep in the rock a cave , and up above the cliff there was more woods for about fifty yards which ended at a gravelled country road . Across the gravel road farmers were working in their fields . Hearing their voices and the snorts and jingles of their horses and harness , he had a strange sweet secretive excitement . Peeking through the screen of leaves that marked the end of the wood , he could see them , four men in overhalls and rubber boots standing beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A lot of cars used this gravelled country road , too . One of the cars , with a man and three women in it , stopped to talk to the four men , and Bell suddenly knew what he was going to do . In a sweet , hot rush of visceral excitement he retreated through the trees almost all the way back to the clifftop and began to take off his clothes . Naked as the day he was born in the warm , rich June air , sporting a throbbing erection , he crept like an Indian back to the screen of leaves , the twigs and old leaves crunching noiselessly under his bare feet , leaving his clothes and his sandwiches back there behind him because that was all part of it : his clothes must be far enough away so that he could never reach them in time if he were caught or seen , otherwise it was cheating ; and standing just behind the leaf screen , where he could see them and the expressions on all their faces , trembling violently in his excitement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gaff beneath a ledge on Guadalcanal , helping along the wounded sergeant beside him , John Ball stopped and stared , transfixed by a revelation . And the revelation , brought on by his old memory , and which he was forced to face , was that his volunteering , his climb out into the trough that first time , even his participation in the failed assault , all were  --  in some way he could not fully understand  --  sexual , and as sexual , and in much the same way , as his childhood incident of the gravelled road . " Ouch ! " said the sergeant beside him . " God damn it ! " " Oh ! I 'm sorry ! " Bell said . He had not thought of that episode in a long time . When he had told that one to his wife Marty , it had excited her too , and they had gone rushing off to bed together to make love . Ahhhhh , Marty !  | The silent cry was like an explosion wrung involuntarily from his bowels . Covertly Bell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Were their reactions sexual too , then ? How to know ? He could n't tell . But he knew that he himself , as had all the others said too , would be volunteering to go back again tomorrow if the chance arose . Partly it was an esprit de corps and a closeness of comradeship coming from having shared something a bit tougher than the rest . Partly it was Captain Gaff whom he liked and respected more and more all the time . And partly , for him at least , it was that other thing , which he could hardly name , that thing of sexuality . Could it be that with the others ? Could it be that all war was basically sexual ? Not just in psych theory , but in fact , actually and emotionally ? A sort of sexual perversion ? Or a complex of sexual perversions ? That would make a funny thesis and God help the race . But whether or not Bell could discover in his comrades anything about their sexual involvement , and he could n't , he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sense of no longer feeling human which he had become aware of in himself on the way up , was growing apace on all their faces . Even Gaff who had only been up here with them for a couple of hours was showing a bit of it now . So Bell was not alone . And when they crawled , limping and licking their wounds , back into the midst of the Battalion , which was already beginning to take on the look of a permanent , organized position , which indeed it was , or was soon to become , he was able to note the same ahumanness in many other faces , some more than others , all of them almost precisely measurable in direct ratio to what the owner of the face had been through since dawn today . Next to his own little assault group , those who had made the first crossing with Keck showed it the most . It was getting very close to dark . In their absence , they found most of Charlie had on Colonel Tall 's orders already dug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As it turned out , their little battle had been heard and interpreted correctly as a failure , and because of this B-for-Baker had been ordered to pass below  | and to the rear of Charlie , curving their flanks uphill to join and thus completing the defensive circle , and were now busily at work digging their holes for the night . There was to be no withdrawal . Holes for themselves , the little assault force , were already being dug for them , also on Colonel Tall 's orders . And as it also turned out , as they found out almost immediately , they were going to get a chance at the bunker again tomorrow . Colonel Tall made this plain to them as soon as he took Captain Gaff 's report . Colonel Tall 's plan for a night attack , about which they knew nothing and of which they heard with astonishment , had been vetoed by the Division Commander . But at least , Colonel Tall said , he had made the offer . Anyway , he agreed with Captain Gaff 's tactical interpretation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his recommendation for the DSC , then with each of the others , excepting of course Lieutenant Gray , who was already on his way back to Hill 209 on a stretcher . Then , tucking his bamboo baton under his arm , he dismissed the enlisted men and turned to a dispositions discussion about tomorrow with the officers . Colonel Tall 's plan , which he had devised after receiving the news of the rejection of his proposed night attack , was one calculated to take account of every contingency , and it utilized  --  as Bugger Stein was quick to note  --  Stein 's suggestion of today to explore the right for the possibility of a flanking maneuver . Before dawn Stein was to take his C-for-Charlie Company ( less the men with Gaff ) back across the third fold and move down the hollow to the right into the jungle which had been so quiet today . Unless he encountered very heavy resistance , he was to push on to the top of the Elephant 's IIead from the rear . " That Elephant 's Trunk is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " smiled Colonel Tall . If Stein could get astride of it higher up where the slopes were steeper , perhaps they could bottle up the whole force . Meantime , Baker would be moved by Captain Task up to the ledge , where he would wait the reduction of the strongpoint by Captain Gaff 's assault force to begin his uphill frontal attack . " I 'm giving you the roundabout flanking movement , Stein , because it was your idea in the first place , " said Colonel Tall . Perhaps , but  | only perhaps , and then even only to Stein , there was a veiled double meaning in the slightly thin way Tall said it . " That Bell , " Colonel Tall said after the discussion of his plan was over . He looked off to where he had thoughtfully placed the assault force near to Gaff 's hole and his own . " He 's a good man . " This time the unspoken meaning was clear to every officer present , since they all knew , and they knew Tall knew , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure is ! " young Captain Gaff put in with boyish enthusiasm , and without reservation . " In my company I have always found him an excellent soldier , " Stein said when Tall glanced at him . Tall said no more , and so neither did Stein . He was willing enough to let well enough alone . Stein had increasingly found himself put by Tall into the position of a guilty schoolboy who had failed his exam , although the Colonel had never said anything to him openly or directly . Slowly the talk among the officers drifted back to the outlook for tomorrow as they squatted in the center of the position . It was almost quiet now ; the high racketing which had hung in the air all day had ceased some time ago , and only sporadic riflefire was heard now in the distance . Both sides lay waiting and breathing . And as the twilight deepened , that was the way they remained : the little knot of officers in the center discussing the prospects and possibilities of tomorrow , the men in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Battalion at the end of its first real day of real combat : neither successful nor unsuccessful , nothing decided , exhausted , growing numb-er . Just before full dark the officers parted and went to their own holes to lie down and wait with the men for the expected Japanese night attack . Perhaps the worst thing was that now one could no longer smoke . That , and the shortage of water . A few more men had collapsed during the late afternoon and been carted away like the wounded , and many more remained on the verge of collapse . Fear was a problem too , more in some , less in others , according to how far the ahuman numbness had advanced in each . John Bell was not afraid at all now , he found . Wait until the shooting started , to get scared .  | They were paired off of course in each two holes , one man to guard , one to sleep ; but nobody slept very much . Quite a few men , spending their first night outside their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fired at nothing , revealing their positions ; but the expected Japanese night attack did not develop , though they did manage to cut both companies ' sound power phone lines . Probably they were too weak and too sick to attack . And so the Battalion lay and waited for the dawn . Along about two o'clock John Bell suffered another malarial attack of chills and fever like the one he had had two days before on the road , except that this one was much worse . At its worst he was shaking so uncontrollably that he would have been of no use to anybody if the Japanese had attacked . And he was not alone . First Sergeant Welsh , clutching his precious musette bag containing the leatherbound Morning Report book in which for tomorrow he had already recorded in the dusk all of the personnel changes of today : " KIA ; WIA ; Sick ; " ? suffered his first malarial attack , which was worse than Bell 's second one , though neither knew it about the other . And there were others . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corner of his hole cursing hysterically , and spent the rest of the night trying to keep his feet out of it . To have gotten out of your hole was worth your life with this bunch .  | BILLIONS OF HARD , BRIGHT STARS SHONE WITH relentless glitter all across the tropic night sky . Underneath this brilliant canopy of the universe , the men lay wide awake and waited . From time to time the same great cumuli of the day , black blobs now , sailed their same stately route across the bright expanse blotting out portions of it , but no rain fell on the thirsting mien . For the first time since they had been up in these hills it did not rain at all ( luring the night . The night had to be endured , and it had to be endured dry , beneath its own magnificent beauty . Perhaps of them all only Colonel Tall enjoyed it . Finally , though it was still black night , cautionary stirrings and whispers sibilated along the line from hole to hole as the word to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlight of false dawn the grubby , dirtyfaced remnants of C-for-Charlie sifted from their holes and coagulated stiffly into their squads and platoons to begin their flanking move . There was not one of them who did not carry his cuts , bruises or abrasions from having flung himself violently to the ground the day before . Thick fat rolls of dirt pressed beneath the mudcaked fingernails of their hands , greasy from cleaning weapons . They had lost forty-eight men or just over one-fourth of their number yesterday in killed , wounded or sick ; nobody doubted they would lose more today . The only question remaining was : Which ones of us ? Who exactly ?  | Still looking dapper although he was now almost as dirty as themselves , Colonel Tall with his little bamboo baton in his armpit and his hand resting on his rakishly lowslung holster , strode among them to tell them good luck . He shook hands with Bugger Stein and Brass Band . Then they trudged away in the ghostly light , moving away eastward back down the ridge to face their new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the area , they had crossed back over the third fold  --  where they had lain so long in terror yesterday , and where the familiar ground now looked strange  --  and had traversed the low between the folds to the edge of the jungle where they were hidden , where Col Tall would not let them go yesterday , and where not a single Japanese was in sight . Approaching it cautiously with scouts out , they found nobody at all . A hundred yards inside the jungle they discovered a highly passable , much used trail , its mud covered with prints of Japanese hobnailed boots , all pointing toward Hill 21o . As they moved along it quietly and without trouble , they could hear the beginning of the fight on the ridge  --  where they had left the previously four , but now five volunteers with Captain Gaff . Tall had not waited long . B-for-Baker now manned the line of holes behind the ledge . Tall sent them forward to the ledge itself , and as soon as it was light enough to see at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objective was to wheel right in a line pivoted on the ledge so that they would be facing the strongpoint . This would place them in a position to aid Gaff . But the middle platoon 's move was not successful . MG fire from the strongpoint , and other hidden points nearby , hurt them too badly . Four men were killed and a number of others were wounded . They were forced to return . That was the noise of the fight C-forCharlie heard ; and its failure left everything up to Gaff and his now five volunteers . They would have to take the strongpoint alone . Tall walked over to them where they lay . This fifth volunteer with Gaff was Pfc Cash , the icy-eyed taxidriver from Toledo with the mean face , known in C-for-Charlie as " Big Un . " Earlier , before C-for-Charlie moved out , Big Un had come up to Tall in the dark and in a ponderous voice had asked to be allowed to stay behind and join Gaff 's assault group . Tall , who  | was not used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe his ears . He could not even remember ever having seen this man . " Why ? " he asked sharply . " Because of what the Japs done to them two guys from 2d Battalion three days ago on Hill 209 , " Big Un said . " I ai nt forgotten it , and I want to get myself a few of them personally before I get knocked off or shot up without getting a chance to kill some . I think Capn Gaff 's operation 'll be my best oppratunity . " For a moment Tall could not help believing he was being made the victim of some kind of elaborate and tasteless hoax , perpe. trated by the wits of Charlie Company who had sent this great oaf up to him deliberately with this stupid request for personal , heroic vendetta . 1st Sgt Welsh , for one , had a mind capable of such subtle ridicule . But when he looked up ( as he was forced to do ; and Tall was by no means a small man ) at this huge , murderous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could see despite his flare of anger that the man was obviously sincere . Cash stood , his rifle slung not from one shoulder but across his back , and carrying in his hands one of those sawed-off shotguns and bandolier of buckshot shells which some fool of a staff lieutenant had had the bright idea of handing out for " close quarter work " the night before the attack ? which meant that Cash had hung onto the damned thing all through the danger of yesterday . Tall thought they had all been thrown away . A sudden tiny thrill ran through Tall despite himself . The brute really was big ! But his own reaction made his even more angry . " Soldier , are you serious ? " he snapped thinly . " There 's a war on here . I 'm busy . I 've got a serious battle to fight . " " Yes , " Big Un said , then remembering his manners added , " I mean : Yes , sir : I 'm serious . " Tall pressed his lips together . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he should know he was supposed to go through channels : through his Platoon Leader and his Company Commander to Gaff himself ; not come bothering the Battalion Commander with it when the Battalion Commander had a battle to fight . " Do nt you know ? " he began in frustration , and then stopped  | himself . Tall prided himself on being a professional and such requests for personal vendetta offended and bored him . A professional should ignore such things and fight a battle , or a war , as it developed on the ground . Tall knew Marine officers who laughed about the jars of gold or gold-filled Japanese teeth some of their men had collected over the campaign , but he preferred to have nothing to do with that sort of thing . Also , though his protege Gaff had lost two men yesterday evening , they had decided between them that the experience and the knowledge of the terrain gained by the survivors more than made up for the adding of two green replacements who would probably be more liability than help . Still .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , waiting dumbly , as though his wishes were the only ones in the world , and blocking Tall 's path with his huge frame so Tall could not see anything that was going on . After biting the inside of his lip , he snapped out coldly , " If you want to go with Captain Gaff , you 'll have to go talk to him about it and ask him . I 'm busy . You can tell him that I do nt object to your going . Now , God damn it , go away ! " he yelled . He turned away . Big Un was left holding his shotgun . " Yes , Sir ! " he called after the Colonel . " Thank you , Sir ! " And while Tall had continued with getting C-for-Charlie moving , Cash had gone in search of Gaff . Big Un 's cry of thanks after the Colonel had not been without his own little hint of sarcasm . He had not been a hack pusher all his life not to know when he was being deliberately snubbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As far as intelligence went , Big Un was confident he could have been as intelligent as any ? and more intelligent than most  --  if he had not always believed that school and history and arithmetic and writing and reading and learning words were only so much uninteresting bullshit which took up a man 's time and kept him from getting laid or making an easy buck . He still believed it , for his own kids as well as for himself . He had never finished his first year of high school and he could read a paper as well as anybody . And as for intelligence , he was intelligent enough to know that the Colonel 's statement  | about not objecting was tantamount to acceptance by Gaff . In fact , all the time he was talking there to the Colonel , Big Un had intended to tell Gaff that , anyway . Now he could tell him truthfully . So , in the still dark predawn , Gaff and his four volunteers were treated to the awesome spectacle of Big Un looming up over them through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shells which he had clung to so dearly all through the terror of yesterday in his US-made shellhole among the 1st Platoon . Stolidly and without excitement , Big Un made his report . As he had anticipated , he was immediately accepted  --  although Gaff , too , looked at his shotgun strangely . All he had left to do was find Bugger Stein and report the change , then come back and lie down with the others to wait until B Company 's middle platoon made its attack and it was their own turn . Big Un did so with grim satisfaction . There was little for them to do but talk . During the half hour it took the middle platoon of B Company to fail and come turnbling and sobbing back over the ledge with drawn faces and white eyes , the six of them lay a few yards back down the slope behind B 's right platoon which in addition to holding the right of the line along the ledge was also acting as the reserve . It was aura  --  ring how the longer one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for others who were getting shot up as long as oneself was in safety . Sometimes the difference was a matter of only a very few yards . But terror became increasingly limited to those moments when you yourself were in actual danger . So , while B 's middle platoon shot and were shot , fought and sobbed thirty yards away beyond the ledge , Gaff 's group talked . Cash the new addition more than made his presence felt . Big Un himself did very little of the talking , after explaining his reason for wanting to come with them , but he made himself felt just the same . Unslinging his rifle , he arranged it and the shotgun carefully to keep their actions out of the dirt , and then simply lay , toying with the bandolier of shotgun shells and slipping them in and out of their cloth loops , his face a stolid , mean mask . The slingless shotgun was a brandnew , cheap-looking automatic with its barrel sawed off just behind the choke and a five shell magazine ; the shot shells themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loaded with a full load of BB shot capable of blowing a large , raw hole clear through a man at close range . It was a mean weapon , and Cash looked like the man to use it well . Nobody really knew very much about him in C-for-Charlie . He had come in as a draftee six months before and while he had made acquaintances , he had made no real friends . Everybody was a little afraid of him . He kept to himself , did most of his drinking alone , and while he never offered to challenge anybody to a fight , there was something about his grin which made it plain that any challenges he received would be cheerfully and gladly accepted . Nobody offered any . At six foot four and built accordingly , in an outfit where physical fighting prowess was considered the measure of a man 's stature , nobody wanted to try him . Except for Big Queen ( over whom he towered by five inches , though he did not weigh as much ) he was the biggest man in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying slyly to promote this battle of the giants between Big Un and Big Queen , just to see who would win ; and many bets might have been taken , except that nothing ever came of it . Curiously enough , the nearest Big Un ever came to having a real friend was Witt the Kentuckian who hardly came up to his waist , and who used to go on pass with him before Witt was forcibly transferred . This turned out to be because in Toledo Big Un had known and admired so many Kentuckians who had come up north to work in the factories , and had liked their strong , hardheaded sense of honor which showed itself in drunken brawls over women or fistfights over particular prize seats at some bar . But now , today , he did not even speak to Witt beyond a perfunctory grunt of greeting . The rest of them watched him and his shotgun curiously . Despite the fact that they were now seasoned veterans of this particular assault and could look down on Big Un from this height of snobbery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . John Bell , for one , had forgotten all about the Japanese torture killing of the two George Company men three days before . It was too long ago and too much had happened to him since . When Big Un recalled it with such surprise to them all , Bell found it did n't really matter so much any more . Guys got killed , one way or another way . Some got tortured . Some got gutshot like Tella . Some got it  | quick through the head . Who knew how much those two guys suffered , really ? Only themselves ; and they no longer existed to tell it . And if they no longer existed , it did n't either and was no longer important . So what the fuck ? A wall existed between the living and the dead . And there was only one way to get over it . That was what was important . So what was all this fuss about ? Bell found himself eyeing Big Un coolly and wondering what his real angle was , behind all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt the same way , Bell noted , from the peculiar looks on their faces ; but nobody said anything . Thirty-five yards away beyond and above the little protective ledge the middle platoon of Baker still fired and fought and now and then yelled just a little bit . If Bell was any judge by the sound of it , what was left of them would be coming back pretty quickly . A rough fingernail of excitement picked at his solar plexis when he thought what this would mean soon for himself . Then , suddenly , like a bucket of cold water dashed in his face , his own supreme callousness smashed into his consciousness and shook him with a sense of horror at his own hardened brutality . How would Marty like being married to this husband , when he finally did get home ? Ah , Marty ! so much is changing ; everywhere . Therefore , when the middle platoon of B did come rolling and tumbling and cursing and sobbing back over the ledge with their white eyeballs in their faces and their open mouths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of all proportion even to their own . How the others in the assault group felt about the return of the platoon , Bell could not tell . From their faces they all , including Cash , seemed to feel the same cool , guarded callousness he himself had just been feeling , and now was so desperately wanting not to feel . The Baker Company men lay against the ledge staring at nothing and seeing nobody and breathing in long painful gasps through their parched throats . There was no water to give them and they needed water badly . Though the day was not yet really hot , they were all sweating profusely , thus losing even more precious moisture . Making a noise like a battery of frogs in a swamp two of them rolled up their eyeballs and passed out . Nobody bothered to  | help them . Their buddies could n't . And the assault group only lay and watched them . This lack of water was becoming a serious problem for everybody , and would be more of one as the glaring equatorial sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plenty of it in the rear  --  no water could be got this far forward to them . Curiously enough , it was little Charlie Dale the insensitive , rather than Bell or Don Doll , who voiced it for all of them in the assault group . Imaginative or not he was animal enough to know what his belly told him and be directed by it . " If they do nt get us some water up here soon , " he said loud enough to be heard by everybody in the vicinity , " we ai nt none of us going to make it to the top of this hill . " Abruptly , he rolled over to face the looming shape of Hill tog in their rear and began to shake his fist at it . " Dirty Fuckers ! Dirty bastards ! Pig bastards ! You got all the fucking water in the world , and you drinking ever fucking drop of it , too ! You ai nt lettin any of it get past you up to us , are you ! Well you better get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or you can take your goddam fucking battle and shove it up your fat ass and lose it ! " He had yelled this much of his protest , and it verberated off along the ledge where nobody , least of all the middle platoon of B , paid any attention to it . The rest of it tapered away into an intense , unintelligible mutter which , as Colonel Tall now sauntered toward them from his command hole baton in hand , became a respectful and attentive silence . The Colonel whose walk was leisurely and erect  --  as straight up as he could get , in fact  --  condescended to squat while he talked in a low serious voice to Gaff . Then they were off and crawling again along the by now so familiar ledge  --  familiar to the point of real friendliness almost , John Bell thought , which could be a bad trap if you believed it  --  as it curved away out of sight around the hill 's curve , Gaff in the lead . Bell crawled around Charlie Dale in the second spot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better let me take the point , Sir , " he said respectfully . Gaff turned his head to look at him with intense , crinkled eyes . For a long moment the two , officer and ex-officer , looked honestly  | into each other 's eyes . Then with an abrupt gesture of both head and hand Gaff admitted his small error and signaled Bell to go on past him . He let one more man , Dale , pass him and then fell into the third spot . When Bell reached the point where the trough began and Lieutenant Gray had died , he stopped and they all clustered up . Gaff did not bother to give them any peptalk . He had already explained the operation to them thoroughly , back at the position . Now all he said was , " You all know the job we 've got to do , fellows . There 's no point in my going over it all again . I 'm convinced the toughest part of the approach will be the open space between the end of the trough here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think it wo n't be so bad . Remember that we may run into smaller emplacements along the way . I 'd rather bypass them if we can , but we may have to knock some of them out if they block our route and hold us up . Okay , that 's all . " He stopped and smiled at them looking each man in the eyes in turn : an excited , boyish , happy , adventuresome smile . It was only slightly incongruous with the tensed , crinkled look in his eyes . " When we get up to them , " Gaff said , " we ought to have some fun . " There were several weak smiles , very similar to his own if not as strong . Only Witt 's and Big Un 's seemed to be really deep . But they were all grateful to him . Since yesterday all of them , excepting Big Un , had come to like him very much . All last evening , during the night , and again during the predawn movements , he had stayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , spending his time with them . He kidded , cajoled and boosted them , cracking jokes , telling them cunt stories about his youth at the Point and after , and all the kooky type broads he had made  --  had in short treated them like equals . Even for Bell who had been one it was a little thrilling , quite flattering to be treated as an equal by an officer ; for the others it was moreso . They would have followed Gaff anywhere . He had promised them the biggest drunk of their lives , everything on him , once they got through this mess and back down off the line . And they were grateful to him for that , too . He had not , when he promised , made any mention about survivors ' or ' those who were left ' having this drunk together , tacitly assuming  | that they would all be there to enjoy it . And they were grateful for that also . Now he looked around at them all once more with his boyish , young adventurer 's eager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be leading from here on out , " he said . " Because I want to pick the route myself . If anything should happen to me , Sergeant Bell will be in command , so I want him last . Sergeant Dale will be second in command . They both know what to do . " Okay , let 's go . " It was much more of a sigh than a hearty bellow . Then they were out and crawling along the narrow , peculiarly sensed dangerousness of the familiar trough , Gaff in the lead , each man being particularly careful of the spot where the trough opened out into the ledge and Lieutenant Gray the preacher had absentmindedly got himself killed . Big Un Cash , who was new to all this , was especially careful . John Bell , waiting for the others to climb out , caught Charlie Dale staring at him with a look of puzzled , but nonetheless hateful enmity . Dale had been appointed Acting Sergeant at least an hour before Bell , and therefore should have had the seniority over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . A moment later it was Dale 's turn to go , and he climbed out into the trough without a backward look . Only one man , Witt , remained between them . Then it was Bell 's own turn . For the  --  what was it ? third ? fourth ? fifth time ? Bell had lost track  --  he climbed out over the ledge and crawled past the thin screen of scrub brush . It was beginning to look pretty bedraggled now from all the MG fire which had whistled through it . In the trough ahead with his head down Charlie Dale was thinking furiously that that was what you could always expect from all goddam fucking officers . They hung together like a pack of horse thieves , busted out or not . He had broke his ass for them all day yesterday . He had been appointed Acting Sergeant by an officer , by Bugger Stein himself , not by no fucking platoon sergeant like Keck . And about a hour before . And look who got command ? You could n't trust them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no more than you could trust the government itself to do something for you . Furiously , outraged , keeping his head well down , he stared at the motionless feet of Doll in front of him as if he wanted to bite them off .  | Up ahead Gaff had waited , looking back , until they were all safely in the trough . Now there was no need to wait longer . Turning his head to the right he looked off toward the strongpoint , but without raising his head high enough to see anything above the grass . Were they waiting ? Were they watching ? Were they looking ? at this particular open spot ? He could not know . But no need in spotting them a ball by exposing himself if they were . With one last look back directly behind him at Big Un Cash , who favored him with a hard , mean , gimleteyed grin that was not much help , he bounced up and took off with his rifle at high port , running agonizingly slowly and pulling his knees up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ player running through stacks of old tires . It was ludicrous to say the least , not a dignified way to be shot , but not a shot was fired . He dived in behind the shoulder of the knob and lay there . After waiting a full minute he motioned the next man , Big Un , to come on . Big Un , who had moved up , as the others had moved up behind him , took right off at once running in the same way , his rifle pounding against his back , the shotgun in his hands , his helmet straps flapping . Just before he reached the shoulder a single machinegun opened up , but he too dived to safety . The machinegun stopped . The third man , Doll , fell . He was only about five yards out when several MGs opened up . They were watching this time . It was only twenty or twenty-five yards across , the open space , but it seemed much longer . He was already breathing in ripping gasps . Then his foot caught in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . Oh , no ! Oh , no ! his mind screamed at him in panic . Not me ! Not after all the rest that 's happened to mel Not after all I 've lasted through ! I wo n't even get my medal ! Blindly , spitting grass seeds and dust , he clambered up and staggered on . He only had ten yards more to go , and he made it . He fell in upon the other two and lay sobbing for breath and existence . The bright , washed sun had just come up over the hills in the east . By now in the early morning sunshine and stark shadows all the MGs from the strongpoint were firing , hosing down the trough itself as well as the open space . Bullets tore over the heads of Charlie Dale , Witt and Bell in bunches which rattled and bruised the poor thin little bushes . It was now Dale 's turn to go , and he was still  | furious at Bell . " Hey , wait ! " Bell yelled from behind him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got an idea ! " Dale gave him one hate-filled contemptuous look and got to his feet . He departed without a word , chugging along solidly like a little engine , in the same way he had gone down and come back up the slope in front of the third fold yesterday . By now a sort of semi-path had been pushed through the grass , and this aided him some . He arrived behind the shoulder and sat down , apparently totally unmoved , but still secretly angry at Bell . Nothing had touched him . " You must be out of your mind ! " Captan Gaff shouted at him . " Why ? " Dale said . Maliciously , he settled himself to see what fucking Bell would do now . Heh heh . Not that he wanted him to get hurt , or anything . Bell demonstrated his idea immediately . When he and Witt had crawled to the end of the trough , the MGs still firing just over their heads , Bell pulled the pin on a grenade and lobbed it at the strongpoint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he threw it into the angle formed by the ledge and the trough , so that it landed in front of the bunker but further back much closer to the ledge . When the MGs all swung that way , as they did immediately , he and Witt crossed in safety before they could swing back . Clearly the three of them could have done it just as easily , and when he threw himself down grinning in the safety behind the shoulder , Bell winked at Charlie Dale again . Dale glowered back . " Very bright , " Gaff laughed . Bell winked at Dale a third time . Fuck him . Who did he think he was ? Then suddenly , after this third wink , like some kind of a sudden stop , Bell realized the fear he had felt this time had been much less , almost none at all , negligible . Even when those bullets were sizzing just over his head . Was he learning ? Was that it ? Or was he just becoming inured . More brutalized , like Dale . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while he sat staring at nothing , then slowly faded away . And so what ? If answer is yes , or if question does not apply to you , pass on to next questionnaire . What the hell , he thought . Fuck it . If he only had a drink of water , he could do anything . The MGs from the strongpoint were still hosing and belaboring the empty trough and its poor straggly bushes as the party moved away .  | Gaff had told them that he thought the rest of the route would be easier once they were past the open space , and he was right . The terrain mounted steeply around the knob which jutted out of the ridge and up here the mat of grass was not quite so thick , but now they were forced to crawl . It was next to impossible to see the camouflaged emplacements until they opened up , and they could not take any chances . As they moved along in this snail 's way , sweating and panting in the sun from the exertion , Bell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to beat with a heavier pulse , a mingled excitement and fear which was by no means entirely unpleasant . They all knew from yesterday that beyond the knob was a shallow saddle between the knob and the rock wall where the ledge ended , and it was along this saddle which they were to crawl to come down on the Japanese from above . They had all seen the saddle , but they had not seen behind the knob . Now they crawled along it , seeing it from within the Japanese territory . They were not fired upon , and they did not see any emplacements . Off to the left near the huge rock outcrop where the seven Japanese men had made their silly counterattack early yesterday , they could hear the tenor-voiced Japanese MGs firing at Baker Company at the ledge ; but nothing opened up on them . When they reached the beginning of the saddle , sweating and half-dead from the lack of water , Gaff motioned them to stop . He had to swallow his dry spittle several times before he could speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commander of Baker 's right platoon would move his men along the ledge to the trough and be ready to charge from there at Gaff 's whistle signal , and because of this he unhooked his whistle from his pocket . The saddle was about twenty or twenty-five yards across , and he spaced them out across it . Because of the way it fell the strongpoint below was still invisible from here . " Remember , I want to get as close to them as we can before we put the grenades to them . " To Bell 's mind , overheated and overwrought , the Captain 's phraseology sounded strangely sexual ; but Bell knew it could not be . Then Gaff crawled out in front of them , and looked back . " Well , fellows , this is where we separate the men from the boys , " he told them , " the sheep from the goats . Let 's crawl . " He clamped  | his whistle in his teeth and cradling his rifle while holding a grenade in one hand , he commenced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spite of his promise of a big beerbust , everything paid for by him , Gaff 's volunteers did not take too kindly to his big line . Shit , I could have done better than that myself , Doll thought , spitting out yet another grass seed . Doll had already entirely forgotten his so near escape crossing the open space , and suddenly for no apparent reason he was transfixed by a rage which ranged all through him like some uncontrollable woods fire . Do not fire until you see the red of their assholes , Gridley . You may shit when ready , Gridley . Damn the torpedoes , full crawl ahead . Sighted Japs , grenaded same . There are no atheists in foxholes , Chaplain ; shit on the enemy ! He was  --  for no reason at all , except that he was afraid  --  so enraged at Gaff that he could have put a grenade to him himself right now , or shot him . On his left , his , major competition Charlie Dale crawled along with narrowed eyes still hating all officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final line only proved him right . Beyond Dale , Big Un Cash moved his big frame along contemptuously , his rifle still on his back , the fully loaded shotgun cradled in his arms ; he had not come along on this thing to be given dumb slogans by no punk kid officers  --  sheeps and goats my ass , he thought and there was no doubt in his hard hackpusher 's mind about which side he would be on when the count came . Witt , beyond Big Un and himself the extreme left flank , had merely spat and settled his thin neck down into his shoulders and set his jaw . He was not here for any crapped up West Point heroics , he was here because he was a brave man and a very good soldier and because his old outfit C-for-Charlie needed him ? whether they knew it or not ; and Gaff could spare him the conversation . Slowly , as they crawled , the extreme left of the strongpoint came into view fifty yards away and about twenty yards below them . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not thinking about young Captain Gaff at all . As soon as Gaff had made his bid for an immortal line Bell had dismissed it as stupid . Bell was thinking , instead , about cuckoldry . Why that subject should come into his mind at a time like this Bell did n't know , but it had and he could n't get rid of it . Thinking about it seriously , Bell discovered  | that under serious analysis he could only find four basic situations : sad little husband attacking big strong lover , big strong lover attacking sad little husband , sad little husband attacking big strong wife , big strong wife attacking sad little husband . But always it was a sad little husband . Something about the emotional content of the word automatically shrunk all cuckolded husbands to sad little husbands . Undoubtedly many big strong husbands had been cuckolded in their time . Yes , undoubtedly . But you could never place them in direct connection with the emotional content of the word . This was because the emotional content of the word was essentially funny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was very painful , in an exquisitely unpleasant , but very sexual way . And suddenly Bell knew  --  as well and as surely as he knew he was crawling down this grassy saddle on Guadalcanal  --  that he was cuckold ; that Marty was stepping out , was sleeping with , was fucking , somebody . Given her character and his absence , there was no other possibility . It was as though it were a thought which had been hanging around the borders of his mind a long time , but which he would never allow in until now . But with one man ? or with several ? Which slid one prefer , the one man which meant a serious love affair ? or the several which meant that she was promiscuous ? What would he do when he got home ? beat her up ? kick her around ? leave her ? Put a goddamned grenade in her bed maybe . Ahead of him the entire strongpoint was visible by now , its nearer , right end only twenty-five yards away , and only a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was just then that they were discovered by the Japanese . Five scrawny bedraggled Japanese men popped up out of the ground holding dark round objects which they lobbed up the hill at them . Fortunately only one of the five grenades exploded . It lit near Dale who rolled over twice away from it and then lay huddled as close to the ground as he could get , his face turned away . None of its fragments hit him , but it made his ears ring . " Pull and throw ! Pull and throw ! " Gaff was yelling at them through the noise of the explosion , and almost as one man their six grenades arched at the strongpoint . The five Japanese men who had popped up out of the ground had by now popped back down into it . But as the grenades lit , two other , unlucky Japanese popped up  | to throw . One grenade lit between the feet of one of these and exploded up into him , blowing off one of his feet and putting him down . Fragments put the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Japanese with his foot off lay still a moment then struggled up to sit holding another grenade as the blood poured from his severed leg . Doll shot him . He fell back dropping the ignited grenade beside him . It did not go off . " Once more ! Once morel " Gaff was yelling at them , and again six grenades arched in the air . Again all of them exploded . Doll was a little late getting his away because of the shot , but he got it off just behind the others . This time there were four Japanese standing when the grenades lit , one of them carrying a light MG . The exploding grenades put three of them down , including the man with the Nambu , and the fourth , thinking better of it , disappeared down a hole . There were now five Japanese down and out of action in the little hollow . " Go in ! Go in ! " Gaff cried , and in a moment all of them were on their feet running . No longer did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being brave or being cowardly . Their systems pumped full of adrenaline to constrict the peripheral blood vessels , elevate the blood pressure , make the heart beat more rapidly , and aid coagulation , they were about as near to automatons without courage or cowardice as flesh and blood can get . Numbly , they did the necessary . The Japanese had shrewdly taken advantage of the terrain to save themselves digging work . Behind the holes into the emplacements themselves was a natural little low area where they could come out and sit in cover when they were not actually being shelled , and it also served as a communication trench between the holes . Now in this hollow the scrawny , bedraggled Japanese rose with rifles , swords and pistols from their holes to meet Gaff and his crew . At least , some of them did . Others stayed in the holes . Three tried to run . Dale shot one and Bell shot another . The third was seen to disappear in a grand broadjump over the edge of the rockface where it fell clear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was never seen again and no one ever learned what  | happened to him . The others came on . And Gaff and his troops , the Captain blowing his whistle shrilly with each exhalation of breath , ran to meet them , in clear view of Baker Company at the ledge until they passed out of sight into the hollow . Big Un killed five men almost at once . His shotgun blew the first nearly in two and tore enormous chunks out of the second and third . The fourth and fifth , because the gun was bucking itself higher each time he fired , had most of their heads taken off . Swinging the empty shotgun like a baseball bat , Big Un broke the face of a sixth Japanese man just emerging from a hole , then jerked a grenade from his belt , pulled the pin and tossed it down the hole after him into a medley of voices which ceased in the dull roaring boom of the constricted explosion . While he struggled to unsling the rifle from his back , he was attacked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the officer in the belly from the hip , shot him again in the face to be positive after he was down . Bell had killed two men . Charlie Dale had killed two . Doll , who had drawn his pistol , was charged by another screaming officer who shouted " Banzai ! " over and over and who ran at him whirling his bright , gleaming sword around his head in the air . Doll shot him through the chest so that in a strange laughable way his legs kept right on running while the rest of him fell down behind them . Then the torso jerked the legs up too and the man hit the ground flat out with a tremendous whack . Doll shot him a second time in the head . Beyond him Witt had shot three men , one of them a huge fat sergeant wielding a black , prewar U.S. Army cavalry saber . Taking the overhead saber cut on the stock of his rifle , cutting it almost to the barrel , Witt had buttstroked him in the jaw . Now he shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet except for the wailing chatter of three Japanese standing in a row who had dropped their weapons . There had been , they all realized , a great deal of shouting and screaming , but now there was only the moans of the dying and the hurt . Slowly they looked around at each other and discovered the miraculous fact that none of them was killed , or even seriously damaged . Gaff had a knot on his jaw from firing without cheeking his stock . Bell 's helmet had been shot from his head , the round passing through the metal and up and around inside the  | shell between metal and fiber liner and coming out the back . Bell had an enormous headache . Witt discovered he had splinters in his hand from his busted riflestock , and his arms ached . Dale had a small gash in his shin from the bayonet of a downed and dying Japanese man who had struck at him and whom he subsequently shot . Numbly , they stared at each other . Each had believed devoutly that he would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone that it was Big Un and his shotgun which had won the day , had broken the back of the Japanese fight , and later when they discussed and discussed it , that would remain the consensus . And now in the strange , numb silence  --  still breathing hard from the fight , as they all were  --  Big Un , who still had not yet got his rifle unslung , advanced snarling on the three standing Japanese . Taking two by their scrawny necks which his big hands went almost clear around , he shook them back and forth gaggling helplessly until their helmets fell off , then grinning savagely began beating their heads together . The cracking sound their skulls made as they broke was loud in the new , palpable quiet . " Fucking murderers , " he told them coldly . " Fucking yellow Jap bastards . Killing helpless prisoners . Fucking murderers . Fucking prisoner killers . " When he dropped them as the others simply stood breathing hard and watching , there was no doubt that they were dead , or dying . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back white . " That 'll teach them to kill prisoners , " Big Un announced , glaring at his own guys . He turned to the third , who simply looked at him uncomprehendingly . But Gaff jumped in between them . " We need him . We need him , " he said , still gasping and panting . Big Un turned and walked away without a word . It was then they heard the first shouts from the other side , and remembered they were not the only living . Going to the grassy bank they looked out over and saw the same field they themselves had tried to cross last evening . Coming across it at a run , the platoon from Baker was charging the strongpoint . Back beyond them , in full view from here , the other two platoons of B had left the ledge and were charging uphill , according to Colonel Tall 's plan . And below Gaff and his men the first Baker platoon charged on , straight at them , yelling .  | Whatever their reason , they were a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so everyone thought . Gaff had been blowing his whistle steadily from the moment they first had gone in right up to the end of the fight , and now here came the heroes . Preparing to wave and cheer ironically and hoot derision at their rescuers ' , Gaff 's men were prevented by the sound of a machinegun . Directly below them in one of the apertures , a single MG opened up and began to fire at the Baker Company platoon . As Gaff 's men watched incredulously , two Baker Company men went down . Charlie Dale , who was standing nearest to the door of the embrasure which was firing , leaped over with a shocked look on his face and threw a grenade down the hole . The grenade immediately came flying right back out . With strangled yells everyone hit the dirt . Fortunately , the grenade had been thrown too hard and it exploded just as it fell over the lip of the rockface , where the broadjumping Japanese had also disappeared , hurting nobody . The MG below continued to fire . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Dale , and scrambled to his feet . Pulling the pin on a grenade and holding it with the lever depressed , he grabbed his rifle and ran over to the hole . Leaning around the right side of it , holding his rifle like a pistol in his left hand with the stock pressed against his leg , he began to fire the semi-automatic Garand into the hole . There was a yell from below . Still firing , Witt popped the grenade down the hole and ducked back . He continued to fire to confuse the occupants . Then the grenade blew up with a dull staggering roar , cutting off both the scrabble of yells and the MG , which had never stopped firing . Immediately , others of the little force , without any necessity of orders from Gaff , began bombing out the other four holes using Witt 's technique . They bombed them all , whether there was anyone in them or not . Then they called to the Baker Company platoon to come on . Later , four Japanese corpses were found huddled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the small space Witt had bombed . Death had come for them and they had met it , if not particularly bravely , at least with a sense of the inevitable . So the fight for the strongpoint was over . And without exception something new had happened to all of them . It was apparent in p 300 the smiling faces of the Baker Company platoon as they climbed up over the emplacement leaving five of their guys behind them in the kunai grass . It was apparent in the grinning face of Colonel Tall as he came striding along behind them , bamboo baton in hand . It showed in the savage happiness with which Gaff 's group bombed out the empty bunkers using Witt 's safety technique : one man firing while another tossed the grenades . Nobody really cared whether there was anyone in them or not . But they hoped there were hundreds . There was a joyous feeling in the safety of killing . They slapped each other on the back and grinned at each other murderously . They had finally , as Colonel Tall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , been blooded . They had , as Colonel Tall was later to say , tasted victory . They had become fighting men . They had learned that the enemy , like themselves , was killable ; was defeatable . This feeling had an enormous effect on everyone . It was evident in the other two Baker Company platoons in the way they were now pushing their attack uphill , as Colonel Tall pointed out when he came striding and grinning up to congratulate Captain Gaff . " Look at them move ! " he said from the top of the embankment after they had shaken hands . " And we owe it all to you , John . When they saw you make that attack of yours , and win ! it was like you had put their hearts back into them . Well , let 's have a look around here , now . " There were , it was discovered after a full count , twenty-three Japanese down on the ground of the little hollow . They lay scattered around in various positions and postures . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and two had been shot trying to run . Of the twenty-three most were dead , several were still in process of dying , and a few though badly hurt looked as if they might live . To Gaff and his group , following the Colonel around , it seemed that the number should be considerably higher . They seemed to remember hundreds . But in discussing it it was found that at least four Japanese had been killed ' twice by different men . Even so it  | was a goodly number . Especially when one remembered they were only six in the attacking force , and once again the miracle that II none of them were killed seemed incredible . Partly this was because the Japanese had come out in uncoordinated small groups . But mostly , once again , it was attributed to Big Un and his shotgun , not only for having killed five men so quickly but also for the obvious shock value it had had upon the rest of the Japanese . Big Un himself did not take  --  as yet  --  any pleasure in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Company platoon watched him with heroworshiping eyes . He prowled back and forth and around the single remaining prisoner like a loose wolf trying to get at a caged victim . His shotgun was broken , but now he had his rifle unslung . He appeared to be waiting hopefully for the Japanese to make any move for which he could kill him legitimately . The prisoner himself looked as though he were not capable of escaping anywhere , even if there had been no one around to watch him . Filthy and emaciated , he had a bad case of dysentery and was continually indicating to his Baker Company guards that he had to relieve himself . This he did through a system of signs and pantomime . Then he would squat beside his two dead companions and strain his miserable bowels , all the time eyeing Big Un . he had already messed his pants a couple of times apparently , during the fighting when he could not go outside , and he stank so badly he could be smelled a couple of yards away . All in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything about this sorry specimen moved Big Un , Big Un did not show it in his tough , mean face . Neither did anybody else , including Colonel Tall  --  although Tall immediately marked the peculiarity of the two dead prisoners . It was easy enough to see . They lay side by side forming , with the third , still-living one , a little line quite apart from the rest . Their two helmets lay just beside them , and except for the blood running from their noses they showed no signs of injury or wounds . " What happened here ? " Tall murmured to Gaff . He had already turned away in disgust from the smelly , still-living one . Gaff only raised his eyebrows , as if he did n't know either . He did not want actually to lie to the old boss , but neither did he want to rat on his gang . He had acquired an intense loyalty for them which almost brought tears to his eyes when he thought of it . Tall turned back to the dead ones . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as the live one . He could read well enough what had happened , but he could not understand the method . They should have had their heads bashed in , or been bayoneted , or shot . He did n't like this sort of thing , but on the other hand one had to make allowances for men in the heat of combat . But how had it been done ? " Some sort of explosive concussion ? " he said to Gaff ; " but there are n't any fragment wounds . " He had not expected Gaff to answer , and Gaff did n't ; he shrugged . " Well , " Tall said smiling and loud enough to be heard all around , " a dead brown brother is one brown brother less , is n't it ? " Eventually the real story of how it happened would get back to him anyway , he was sure of that . " Take good care of that one , men ! " he called to the Baker Company guards . " G-2 will want him . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , aye , Sir , yeah , " one of them grinned ; " we 'll take care of him . " With his rifle muzzle he reached out and poked the prisoner , who was squatting and crapping again , and tipped him over backward into his own mess . The men around all laughed , and the prisoner scrambled back to his feet and began to try patiently to clean himself with handfuls of grass . He appeared to expect this kind of treatment and looked as if he were only putting in time , waiting for them to shoot him . Tall turned away again . He had not meant to cause that reaction , but the Baker Company man ( really hardly more than a boy really ) had , because of his remark about dead brown brothers , misinterpreted him . He walked away followed by Gaff . Across the hollow a Baker Company man had just finished kicking one of the wounded Japanese resoundingly in the ribs . It sounded as though someone had just punted a football out of the hollow down the hill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with acquiescent , pain-dulled , animal eyes . " Do nt do that , Soldier ! " " fall called at him sharply . " Okay , Colonel , Sir , if you say so , Sir , " the man answered cheerfully . " But he would of killed me in a minute if he 'd had the chance . " Tall knew that was true enough and he did not answer . Anyway , he did not want to jeopardize the new toughness of spirit which had come over the men after achieving success here . That spirit was more important than whether or not a few Jap prisoners got kicked around , or killed .  | " I think we 've wasted about enough time here , " he said loudly , with a grin for the men . " Sir , " Gaff said tentatively from behind him , and Tall turned around . " Sir , I 've got a few recommendations for decorations I 'd like to turn in to you . " " Yes , yes , " Tall grinned . " Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can . But later . In the meantime I want you to know I 'm personally recommending you for something , John . Perhaps , " he said and leaning forward , took Gaff lightly by his lapel to whisper : " Perhaps even  --  the Big One . " " Well , thank you , Sir . But I do nt feel I really reserve that . " " Oh yes you do . However , getting it for you will be another problem . But it would be a big thing for the Battalion , and for Regiment too , if you did get it . " He let go the lapel and straightened . " But in the meantime , I think we better get moving out of here . I think the best way to proceed is to move right back up the saddle you came down , rather than trying to circle the knob on the left . From the top we can debouch out and extend our line left to hook up with the other platoons . Would you like to take command ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Achs , then . He 's around here somewhere . " " Sir , " Gaff said hesitantly ; " I do nt like to sound depressing or be a wet blanket or anything like that , but what about water ? If we do nt ? " Do nt worry about water ! " Tall said sharply , but then he smiled . " John , I do nt want anything to break up this attack of ours , now that we 've got it started . As for water , I 've already taken care of that . We 'll have some water by ? " he looked at his watch , and then at the sky ? " in a couple of hours . I 've arranged for that . But we ca n't stop now to wait for it . " " No , Sir . " " If some of the men pass out , they 'll just have to pass out , " Tall said . " Yes , Sir . " " If any of them ask you about water , tell them what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do nt mention it unless they ask you . " " No , Sir . But they could die from it , you know . From heat prostration. "  | " They could die from enemy fire , too , " Tall said . He looked around himself , at them . " They 're all tough boys . " He looked back at Gaff . " Okay ? Now , come on . " Together with the lieutenant , Achs , from Baker Company , they began to round up the men who were still staring curiously at the various dead Japanese . " You 'll see plenty more of those , " Tall told them . " At least I hope you will . Come on . " Most of the dead men 's equipment , he noted , had already been appropriated for souvenirs , along with their wallets and the contents of their pockets , and two of Gaff 's volunteers  --  Doll and Cash  --  now carried the sheathed ' Samurai sabers ' of the two officers . Tall would have liked one of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that now . There was too much else to occupy him at the moment . Tall was more worried about the lack of water than he had let Gaff know . It was all very well to say some of the men might have to pass out , or even die , from heat prostration . But if enough of them passed out , he was going to be left without an attack . No matter how much spirit and heart they had recently acquired , or what he himself might do . They were going to have to have some water , and he had done the only thing about it that he knew to do . An hour before  --  back when Gaff and his group were making their crawl  --  Tall had sent out another patrol . Only , the irony of this patrol was that it had gone rearward . Looking for water . Because both sound powers were cut , he had intended to send back a runner to tell them the water situation was reaching critical . But because he had sent back at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all of it the same message , the idea had come to him to send a ' patrol ' instead . And once the patrol idea was in his mind , he decided to go ahead with it and carry it through all the way . He sent his own personal Battalion Hq sergeant and all three of his runners he had left , all of whom carried pistols , of course . Their orders were to proceed rearward as far as they had to go to find water and bring it back with them . They were not even to report in to the Regimental Commander . They were to cross the ridge of Hill 209 away from the command post and travel rearward along the basin until they found people with water and when they found it they were to take it , at gunpoint if necessary . Each man could carry two  | Full jerrycans , Tall decided ; that would be hard on them , but under the circumstances they would have to do it . They were to proceed back as fast as their strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If anyone tried to take any water from them , they were to fight for it . These were harsh orders . And the cruel irony which had forced him to send an armed patrol to the rear into his own lines all ready to fight , was not lost upon Tall 's sense of I , topriety . But he had to do it . Anyway , he did not think it would ever come to the actual shooting point ; nobody back there was going to argue with his boys once they drew their pistols ; but even if it did go to the shooting point he did not intend to lose everything now . He was convinced the Japanese position was now broken . All they had to do was keep going and they would have Hill 210 by noon . And the remarkable spirit which had ballooned in everybody when the strongpoint fell had to be taken advantage of before some other event occurred to sap its strength . To have his battalion relieved in defeat now , or even to have them reenforced by troops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top , was more than Tall could support unless he was absolutely forced to . This was a chance Tall had waited for all his professional life . He had studied , and worked , and slaved , and eaten untold buckets of shit , to have this opportunity . He did not intend to lose it now , not if he could help it . He only hoped that C-for-Charlie was proceeding according to schedule also , and that Stein would not chicken out on him now , and the thinking of this thought , and worrying suddenly about them now , gave him a sudden new idea . An inspiration almost , even . " I want a runner ! " he called out suddenly to the assembling men . It would be , he thought immediately , better to send them one of their own , and he turned in mid-stride and addressed himself to the Charlie Company volunteers who , having no assigned stations with the Baker Company platoon , were all hanging around their new paternal hero , Captain John Gaff .
