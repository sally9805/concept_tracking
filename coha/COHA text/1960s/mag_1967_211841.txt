A particularly virulent and popular commentator for Cairo 's Voice of the Arabs named Ahmed Said last week called for instant death for any Arab leader who dares to open negotiations with Israel . Though Said is a better propagandist than politician , it was a fool hardy Arab leader indeed who could ignore his warning ; the sentiments are shared by a large part of the population . Trapped by their own propaganda , split once more into rival factions and disappointed in their Russian allies , the Arabs seem no closer to any form of negotiation with Israel than they were when the " six-day " war ended six weeks ago . <P> In the United Nations , the Arab-Russian disillusionment reached its apex . Discouraged by their unsuccessful attempt to get the General Assembly to demand the withdrawal of all Israeli forces from Arab territory , the Russians , with American encouragement , tried to persuade the Arabs to accept a resolution that tied withdrawal to recognition of Israel . The Arabs indignantly turned it down . When Russia and the U.S. then voted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East issue back to the Security Council , the Arabs accused the Russians of betraying them , promised to carry on the fight on their own . <P> Bear Hugs . As they listen to Arab fulminations , the Russians are becoming more cautious about their involvement with the Arabs . They gave a bear hug to Algeria 's Houari Boumediene when he visited Moscow last week-but little else . They were aware that Boumediene is trying to stake a claim to leadership of the Arab left , but they made plain that Nasser is still their No. 1 man in the Middle East ; after all , they have already replaced 200 of his 350 destroyed planes . Boumediene went to Moscow straight from Cairo , where five of the more militant and left-leaning Arab chiefs rattled threats against Israel , called for a " second round " of war when the time is ripe and made some big talk about damaging Britain and the U.S. with economic boycotts . " The Arab resistance will go on , " cried Boumediene . " Continuous blows will be dealt to those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <P> Jordan 's King Hussein was so discouraged by what he heard in Cairo on his recent trip that he returned home to Amman in despondency . In an interview with TIME Correspondent Lee Griggs and Managing Editor Otto Fuerbringer , he said that he has lost all hope for an Arab summit conference , at which he had hoped to persuade his fellow Arabs to a more reasonable course-even though he continues to call for one . Jordan , he said , now found itself trapped between Communism and Zionism . It would still try to follow " the moderate way , as before , " but the outlook " is not bright . The pressures are great , particularly the pressures of Arab extremism , which is not helping us solve the problems brought on by the current catastrophe . " Hussein declares that he will not allow Jordan to slip into the Soviet orbit , is convinced that Jordan 's future is still best served by friendship with the West . He has been encouraged by hints from Secretary of State Dean Rusk that the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
