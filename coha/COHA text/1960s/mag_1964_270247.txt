Barring a so-so football record , the University of Iowa is a contented campus this fall . It has regents who value academic freedom , faculty and students hospitable to fresh ideas , ever-more-liberal financial support from the legislature . More important , the university has a tradition of wise , long-reigning presidents . Last week Iowa installed a new one , the first in 24 years . <P> From the start , the man seemed to match the office . Said Howard R. Bowen , 56 , in his inaugural address : " The University of Iowa , located almost literally on the edge of a cornfield , " must be " a place that is hospitable to the individual human being , that raises his aspirations . I hope we shall also seek individuality for the university itself . " <P> Natural Habitat . Bowen 's durable predecessor , Rhodes Scholar Virgil M. Hancher , has kept Iowa in the front rank of state universities . The Iowa City campus is home for some of the most adventuresome minds in science and the arts : Physicist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lasansky , Paul Engle 's famed Writers ' Workshop . The library , medical and law schools are among the best in the U.S. But Hancher is a corporation lawyer by training and cautious by instinct . " He tended to protect what we already had , " says one dean , " but I am more concerned about the future than today 's needs . " With Hancher approaching mandatory retirement at 68 , the regents last year also began to think about the future . Screening more than 130 candidates , they finally chose Bowen , a specialist in economic theory , whom they found only 56 miles away , where he was president of Grinnell College . <P> For Bowen it was a homecoming . He got his doctorate from Iowa , taught there for seven years before becoming an expert in fiscal policy and the problems of small business for the New Deal . Then he worked as an economist for the Irving Trust Co . Over the next ten years he moved from the University of Illinois to Williams College as professor of economics and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school was scratching for students ; by the time he left they were fighting to get in . Grinnell won one of the first Ford Foundation matching grants and , under Bowen , spent $6,000,000 on construction , curriculum revision , faculty wage increases . <P> Another Oxford ? Bowen has brought the same vitality to Iowa since his appointment last spring . Already in progress is $60 million worth of new construction , including a fine arts center designed by Harrison &; Abramovitz . Planning for a big state university was surprisingly similar to the needs of Grinnell , Bowen discovered . " I just had to add another digit or two . " <P> One key set of digits is the student body of 15,000 , due to double in a decade . But Iowa 's new president is determined that the school preserve quality amidst growth , even if it means reorganizing the university along the lines of Oxford 's residential colleges . " While other institutions may take on a somewhat wider range of programs , " he said last week , " I believe our future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoroughness and depth rather than versatility and range .
