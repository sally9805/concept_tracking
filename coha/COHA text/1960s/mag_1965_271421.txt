With national elections due next September , Chancellor Ludwig Erhard and his Christian Democrats can only hope that the next six months will go better for them than the last . Plagued with one embarrassing problem after another-from surrendering to France on grain prices to losing out on the multilateral force to humiliation by the Arabs over Israel 's recognition-Erhard 's regime has sunk in national esteem to its lowest level since der Dicke took office 17 months ago . Latest poll returns show the C.D.U . trailing the Social Democrats , 31% to 35% . <P> All of which made it urgent that the C.D.U . present a united front at its annual party convention in Dsseldorf last week . This was not easy , for as the 3,500 delegates assembled in the austere exhibition hall , it was clear that many high-ranking C.D.U . leaders were sharply at odds with one another . Former Chancellor Konrad Adenauer had made no secret of his contempt for Erhard and his policies . To the horror of C.D.U . strategists , he made plain his intention of saying so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growled Adenauer , " it must come out in the open . " In the end , however , Keynote Speaker Adenauer relented and gracefully pulled the worst of his punches . <P> With that saving gesture to party unity , the rest of the malcontents fell into line . Both Bundestag President Eugen Gerstenmaier and Bavarian Ally Franz Josef Strauss avoided overt criticism of Erhard 's aloof Foreign Minister Gerhard Schroder , whom they detest . Schroder acknowledged their forbearance with the acid observation that " after all , we are a party that must take extra care of its china . " <P> The most fragile bit of china around Bonn recently has been the C.D.U . ' s coalition with the Free Democrats , whose 67 votes provide the C.D.U . with its Bundestag majority over the Social Democrats . The alliance was cracked sadly a fortnight ago when Erhard and the C.D.U . insisted on extending the statute of limitations against Nazi war criminals . Tired of the Nazi trials , the F.D.P . opposed the new legislation on constitutional grounds , and F.D.P . Minister of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cabinet post . To the Free Democrats ' surprise , Erhard called the bluff , promptly replaced Bucher with a C.D.U . man . <P> <P> The chagrined F.D.P . at first threatened to pull out , but finally decided to stay in power with Erhard at least through the elections . It was probably a wise decision . Already frail in the 499-seat Bundestag , the Free Democrats are not all that certain to get the 5% of the total vote necessary to be represented at all in the Bundestag next September . Dramatically abandoning the C.D.U . now might reduce their popular support-and might even make Erhard angry enough to forget his long opposition to a Grand Coalition that would bring Socialists and Christian Democrats together as a new combine to rule West Germany .
