One way to cure juvenile delinquency is to ask bad apples why they have worms . So argues Psychologist Charles W. Slack , who came upon the method accidentally in a Harvard project started four years ago called Streetcorner Research . Originally , he set up shop in a Cambridge storefront and paid young punks to talk their troubles into a tape recorder to find out what made them tick . In the process , he discovered to his surprise that they talk their troubles out : the crime rate among Slack 's subjects has fallen by half . <P> Having made the discovery , Slack set out to profit from it . He assembled a five-man team , including a Jesuit priest-psychologist , and recruited 30 young toughs with police records ranging from burglary to rape- " tomorrow 's nothings , " as one boy put it . Slack lured them with cash : 50 to $2 an hour for being " research consultants " in a study of " how guys foul up . " " Sick , Man , Sick . " The chance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as analysis . Usually , says Slack , the boys passed through five stages : apathy , anger , despair , insight , transformation . <P> Typical was David , 18 , a reform school graduate described as " unreachable " and " psychopathic " He began by aimlessly complaining about everything from prison conditions to cops and fate . Then he got mad , called his interviewer 's necktie the " crummiest " he had ever seen , peered out the window and snapped , " See that guy out there ? Going to mash his mouth in . " Then came despair : " I know there 's no hope left to be anything . I 'm sick , man , sick . Sometimes I feel like laying down in the street and never getting up . Dogs are my friends . They know . They live at people 's feet . " Insight followed : " I think , oh , how I think , of the life I have lived . The life of the devil . Will anyone ever give me a lift ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from the boy himself : " All of a sudden I started looking at a man who was petting a cat . I saw the trees and the people for the first time . And I asked George the janitor questions I never would have asked a few days ago-how he got his job , how he got ahead . And he seemed pleased . " <P> Next : Film . Weaned to regular jobs , Streetcorner 's first 30 boys cut their average arrests to 2-4 in the four-year period , against 4-7 for a comparable control group . They spent a total of 69 months in jail , compared to 134 for the outsiders . The researchers are now experimenting with such ideas as lending cameras to delinquents so they can film their own lives . Another " laboratory " has been set up in a Cambridge barroom . <P> Running such centers does not require a highly trained staff , says Slack . In fact , they are more effective if run by accountants , carpenters , bus drivers , housewives-people the boys can take as models @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : about $500 a year per boy . In Massachusetts , the cost of keeping a prisoner in jail for a year is $3.000.
