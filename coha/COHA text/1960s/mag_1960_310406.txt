As a commercial publishing venture , National Review magazine is a dud . In its brief history , it has spent some $860,000 more than it has taken in . Its founder , Editor in Chief William F. Buckley Jr. , 34 , works for nothing , says that he had to resign from the Yale Club for " economic reasons . " But by Bill Buckley 's lights , National Review is nonetheless a spanking success : it has become the most notable U.S. periodical speaking for the far political right . <P> As of this week , celebrating its fifth birthday , National Review has a circulation of 31,913 , placing it among the leading secular journals of opinion . National Review achieved that status against such veteran competitors as the New Republic ( circ. 35,931 ) and the Nation ( circ. 24,015 ) , whose viewpoints place them at the other end of the political spectrum . <P> National Review is bossed by a brilliant young man who has all his life carried a torch as if it were a branding iron for what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man who built a $100 million empire in Latin American oil . From his weaning , Buckley was immersed in conservative doctrine . At age six , Bill wrote an angry letter to King George V , demanding that England pay its war debt . As a Yale undergraduate , he advised the U.S. State Department to deliver an ultimatum to Russia : Either hold free elections in Czechoslovakia-or else . <P> Bill Buckley entered Yale in 1946 as a confirmed conservative and a Roman Catholic . He was soon appalled-and not the least of his talents is in being appalled - at discovering that his own values were unfashionable there . So , in 1951 , Buckley produced a bestselling book called God and Man at Yale . It accused the Yale faculty , in sweeping terms , of teaching along anti-Christian and anticapitalistic lines . God and Man at Yale became a pro and con reference point for political eggheads of both the left and right . <P> After God and Man , Buckley , in company with his brother-in-law , L. Brent Bozell , wrote a book called McCarthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Wisconsin that was soundly denounced by many who had never taken the trouble to read it . This established Bill Buckley as conservatism 's enfant terrible as well as the scourge of liberalism . National Review , a magazine that would provide him with a regular opportunity to play both roles , was the result . He established National Review as the only U.S. magazine that would " stand athwart history yelling ' Stop ! ' ' <P> In its five years of life , Buckley has led National Review through a sometimes baffling intellectual maze . In 1956 , one of its editors , James ( The Managerial Revolution ) Burnham , recommended President Eisenhower 's reelection : " The least bad choice . " In the same issue , another editor , William S. Schlamm , urged Eisenhower 's defeat : " To liberate the Republican Party from the man who is destroying it . " In 1960 the magazine has endorsed Richard M. Nixon , but with the back of its hand ( " Who likes Nixon 's Republicanism ? We do n't " ) , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
