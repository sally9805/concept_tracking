Heroma is a raw little minority report on the narcotics trade in Manhattan 's Spanish Harlem , made by a group of talented Puerto Ricans . Spoken in Spanish with English subtitles ( plus a peppering of Anglo-Saxon vulgarisms ) , the film is mainly distinguished for acting untouched by the naive semiprofessionalism that blights many a small-budget movie . Topping the cast is Jaime Snchez as Chico , a well-to-do but restless cat who sums up his birthright by stating his birthplace : " 102nd and Lexington . " <P> Snchez ' appealingly altered portrait of a young junkie and dope pusher evokes sympathy mainly by pushing the film 's thesis that most such cases stem from " lack of affection . " Producer-Director Jernimo Mitchell Melendez ignores complex social and psychological factors when he suggests that most addicts turn to the needle to tranquilize Oedipal anguish . But despite his sociological hokum , he projects a sordid milieu with grim documentary accuracy . <P> After doing time on a drug rap , Chico comes home chastened , then stumbles into every conceivable temptation . His parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in with a chic call girl , played by fiery Mexican Beauty Kitty de Hoyos , whose claim to fame loses nothing in translation . Because his hooker can not support both him and her drug habit forever , Chico starts peddling heroin , ultimately resumes using it . <P> Though crudely plotted , the movie offers some bruising glimpses of the drug addict 's world . Director Mitchell turns his camera into streets alive with the ruthless , luckless desperation of hung-up types waiting to score . There is powerful understatement in an eerily casual police raid on a pad full of bleary , turned-on junkies , or in Snchez ' dry heaves when he goes to collect a shipment of " stuff " and finds it sharing a coffin with a stiff . Herona is not much fun to sit through , but the best of it throws a cold clear light into one of Manhattan 's open wounds .
