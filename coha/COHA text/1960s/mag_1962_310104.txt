Did the ancient Greeks have outside toilets ? Up-to-date archaeologists interested in esoteric problems heard last week about a handy way of finding answers to such questions-for a latrine 's humus-rich contents have magnetic properties that vary from the earth around them . <P> The clever instrument that can tell the difference was the hit of an erudite conference that met at Venice to discuss new methods of archaeology . Called a proton magnetometer , the gadget is based on a principle of nuclear physics discovered only a few years ago . The nuclei of hydrogen atoms ( protons ) are , in effect , tiny magnets , and they line up like compass needles parallel to the earth 's magnetic field . When nudged out of alignment , they oscillate for a few seconds , the speed of their oscillation changing with the local strength of the earth 's magnetism . Buried objects that affect the field show up plainly . <P> Bottle &; Coil . The magnetometer displayed at Venice was developed by Oxford 's Research Laboratory for Archaeology , following U.S.-designed electronic circuits . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 oz. ) bottle of plain water , which contains hydrogen and , therefore , protons . Surrounding the bottle is an electrical coil connected to a control box . The magnetometer is usually operated by two people , one of whom moves the bottle from point to point , while the other sits at the control box . To make an observation , the controller presses a button , shooting an electric current from a storage battery through the coil , deflecting the protons in the bottle . When the current stops , the protons oscillate , creating a feeble alternating current in the coil . This current flows back to the control box , where its frequency is measured , giving the strength of the magnetism surrounding the bottle . <P> Oxford Archaeologist M. J. Aitken explained to the conference why almost any disturbance of the soil shows up on the magnetometer . Topsoil is generally more magnetic than soil below it , so when a ditch or cellar gradually fills with material washed from the surface , it distorts the earth 's magnetic field enough to be detected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No Good for Treasure . Ancient rubbish , garbage and human excreta are easily detectable . So are buried walls , whose stones usually have different magnetic properties from the material that covers them . Empty spaces , such as buried tombs , stick out like magnetic sore thumbs . Most conspicuous of all are objects of iron or steel , but the magnetometer does not detect gold and silver , and it will be of little use to treasure seekers . <P> The instrument is now being used to find Sybaris , the rich Greek colony in southern Italy that gave its name to the word sybaritic . After losing a war with the nearby city of Croton . Sybaris was leveled to the ground , and the Crotonians made the river Crathis flow over the ruins and cover the site with silt . Archaeologists hope that some of the city 's interesting features were sealed in protective mud , but they have never known just where to look for them .                   @ @
