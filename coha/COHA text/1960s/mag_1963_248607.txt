If the French have their way , a ride on a subway need no longer be a nerve-racking , ear-wrecking experience on shrieking steel wheels . The government-owned Paris Metro , which celebrated its 63rd birthday last week , has just installed a revolutionary innovation on its high-traffic Vincennes-Neuilly line : cars that run along the tracks on pneumatic tires . The result of ten years of experiments commissioned by the Mtro , the new system was developed jointly by tiremaker Michelin , automaker Renault and the Compagnie Electro-Mcanique . Eventually it will be used along the entire 160-mile length of the Mtro . <P> <P> Though the Mtro is the first to experiment with rubber tires on a subway , the Michelin tires have been in use for nearly five years on a mile-long funicular railway that runs cars up and down Mount Carmel in Haifa , Israel . Last week Montreal ordered rubber-tired rolling stock based on the Metro design for the 9-mile subway it plans to build . Transaco , a French investment firm that is marketing the Metro system , recently signed technical contracts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubber-tired , lightweight subway cars run on concrete or wide steel tracks and provide a swifter , far quieter and more cushioned ride for passengers . The friction of the tires allows quicker stops and starts so that trains can keep to faster schedules ; on some runs the Mtro figures that the extra speed will give it the capacity of five trains for the price of four . The trains are designed so that on existing subway systems they can share the right of way with older trains by straddling the steel rails on their own special track . But Transaco feels that the Mtro system has its biggest future in entirely new transportation systems being planned in many of the world 's growing cities , where authorities can start from scratch to design for the rubber-tired trains .
