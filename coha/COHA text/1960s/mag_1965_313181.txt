&gt; Fred Lorenzen , 30 : the accident-marred , $65,000 National 400 auto race , averaging 119 m.p.h. in his 1965 Ford ; at Charlotte , N.C. A five-car pile-up on the first lap cost the life of Driver Harold Kite , and only 18 of the 44 starters were still around at the end . Lorenzen made his move on the 216th lap ( out of 267 ) , dueled bumper to bumper for the next 45 laps with A. J. Foyt , took the lead for keeps when Foyt clipped the wall at 125 m.p.h. - only nine miles from the finish . <P> &gt; Michigan State : a 14-10 victory over Purdue , in a Rose-Bowl-or-bust battle between the last unbeaten teams still left in the once-mighty Big Ten . Purdue Quarterback Bob Griese passed for one touchdown and kicked a field goal , and the No. 2-ranked Spartans trailed 10-0 going into the final quarter . Then they marched 50 yds. for one TD , 60 yds. for another , won their sixth straight victory of the season . Notre Dame 's only problem was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 170 yds. per game . Problem ? Garrett got only 7 yds. in the first half , and Notre Dame won 28-7 . Princeton annihilated Penn 51-0 to run its winning streak to 14 in a row , but other scores smacked more of soccer than football . Examples : Northwestern 9 , Iowa 0 ; Washington State 8 , Indiana 7 ; Southern Mississippi 3 , Auburn 0 ; Clemson 3 , Texas Christian 0 .
