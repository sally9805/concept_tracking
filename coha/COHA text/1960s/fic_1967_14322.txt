SCENE : A room . In the center of the upstage wall is a door . Stage right of the door on the wall is a huge black-and-white photograph of Bob Dylan without eyes . Stage left of the door is an equally large photo of Robert Goulet without eyes . A sofa against the stage-left wall . A small table at the downstage end of the sofa with a radio on it . A piano against the stage-right wall . An electric guitar lies on the floor down-center with a speaker and amplifier facing the audience . There is a four-piece rock-and-roll band seated in a cage on top of a platform at the back of the audience all dressed exactly like DUKE . They stand to sing their songs , then sit back down when they 're finished . The lights come up fast . DUKE DURGENS enters very fast through the door wearing extra long hair , shades , jeans , boots , vest , etc . He crosses directly downstage center , bows to the audience , and begins to improvise the following song @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starts out fastAnd everybody knows that anybody knowsHow to make it last and lastAnd everybody says that you should n't snoop aroundYou should n't put your nose down to the groundYou should n't say out loud what we already knowYou should say it to yourselfYou should play it by yourselfYou should keep it in your mouthYou should hold it in your throatEven if you bloatEven if you get to the point where you burst . ( He stomps his foot on the ground and stops the song ; he paces up and down , mumbling to himself and hitting his fist into his hand ; he does this for a while , then stops and bows again to the audience . DANA , a girl with long hair , boots , jeans , leather jacket , shades , etc. , enters fast with an envelope in her hand and sits on the sofa ; she opens the envelope and pulls out a letter which she reads to herself while DUKE starts singing again to the audience. ) p. 3 DUKE Nobody knows where the pain got startedIt 's still the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it just goes on like it always doesBut if you 'll come around to the back of my shackIf you 'll come around when your legs start saggingThen I know a way to stop you from gaggingI know a way to rest your headBut if you go on like you always doIf you go on thinking you 're so trueThen the day will come when we 'll all be deadWithout ever knowing what we could have done insteadSo if you 'll come around to the back of my shack ( He stomps his foot again and paces up and down as before . ) DANA How 's it going ? DUKE You heard . Shit . Garbage . Stuff I could have done in school behind everyone 's back . Boy . It 's terrible . Just terrible . I do n't know what to do . DANA You got a letter . DUKE Good . ( continuing to pace ) DANA I 'll read it out loud . DUKE Thank you . DANA ( reading the letter ) " Dear Mr. Durgens : I am a sociologist at Corning University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ musicians . I would like to ask you to participate in this study . My main interest is in discovering what changes occur in the life of a singer when one of his songs is received and acclaimed by the public at large . For example , how did you go about getting your first song , Prisoners , Get Up out of Your Homemade Beds , recorded and once it became a hit how did this affect your life ? " ( DUKE starts singing as he continues to pace , DANA stops reading. ) p. 4 DUKE Wo n't you pretty please move a little to the leftWo n't you pretty please move a little to the rightWo n't you shake your assWo n't you shake your titsWo n't you please shake , baby , before I have fitsWow ! DANA Could I continue , please . DUKE Please do ! Please continue on . There 's more coming and if that 's true I certainly would not want to be the one to block it from coming . Not me ! Not I ! After all , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear ? Not me . DANA Thanks . ( She continues with the letter as DUKE paces . ) DANA " After the public response to Prisoners , Get Up out of Your Homemade Beds , did your relations with friends , colleagues , and others in the music business change ? Did you begin work on a new song or go back to work you had done previously ? Did new opportunities become available in other media , etc. ? " DUKE Yes ! Oh yes . Mr.  --  Mr.  --  who ? DANA Mr. Damon . DUKE Yes , Mr. Damon . Certainly . Vistas opened out and up and all around me . I saw things that I 'd never seen before . I saw dogs burying their own shit as soon as they 'd shat and what 's more wiping themselves afterwards . I saw waiters tipping bankers and  --  p. 5 DANA Shall I go on with this ? DUKE As you wish . ( he continues to pace and hit his hand ) DANA ( reading ) " I mention these few questions to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study . No previous studies have been done concerning the singer and how his personal relationships are affected by the response to his work . The usual question that the historian or academician asks is how a singer 's life affects the content of his work . Here I am concerned with how the reception of his work affects the singer 's social environment . I realize how busy you must be but I hope you will consent to being interviewed . The interview should take about one hour . I can assure you of complete anonymity . I do hope you will participate and I 'm looking forward to your reply . Sincerely yours , Daniel Damon . " DUKE Good , good . Give it here . Let me see . ( he crosses to her and takes the letter , he pulls out a pen and writes on the back of the letter ) " Dear Daniel Damon " DANA Oh Duke . Do n't be silly . Honestly . DUKE " In reply to your letter I would like to say thank you very much . Sincerely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter into a paper airplane. ) p. 6 DANA You should just turn it in to your manager , that 's all . You do n't have to reply personally like that . Turn it in to Floyd . DUKE Floyd 's got work to do . DANA Well so do you . DUKE So do I. I have work and Floyd has work and there 's no gaps in between for anything like replies to Danny Damon . But it must be done . We ca n't leave old Dan hanging . Not a sociologist , at any rate . Sociologists are movers . They do n't hang around waiting for replies . They make up their own if they do n't get them on time . And I 'd hate to see him do that . To create a lie out of my negligence . ( He rushes downstage and throws the letter out into the audience . DANA jumps to her feet . ) DUKE Here it comes , Danny ! Watch it come ! Do n't let it get away ! Yoo hoo ! DANA Duke ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've thrown the letter into the audience . Do you know what that means ? That means anyone can pick that letter up and read it ! And that means that anyone can pretend to be Duke Durgens and walk right up to Danny Damon and say hello I 'm Duke and Danny will say well I 'm glad to meet you at last Mr. Durgens and then he 'll sit down with Mr. Damon and then they 'll just proceed with the interview as though he were you and he 'll tell Danny Damon whatever he wants and Mr. Damon will believe him and write it all down and pay him a great deal of money thinking it 's you and he 'll just leave and go spend it somewhere and there 's no way to trace him because they do n't know his real name or anything and meanwhile , all this fake personal life that he 's conjured up and slandered you with will be written down and printed by Daniel Damon and held forever in the private vaults of Corning University forever and ever with no way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stupid boy . ( FLOYD , DUKE 'S manager , enters wearing shades and a suit ; he crosses to the piano , sits , and starts to play " Chopsticks . " DANA crosses over to him but FLOYD keeps playing , DUKE just starts at the audience. ) p. 7 DANA Floyd , I 'm glad you arrived but Duke is really getting entirely out of hand here recently . He made an airplane out of a letter and threw it away . Can you imagine that ? FLOYD ( still playing ) How did you manage that , Dukie ? DUKE I made the wings and weighted it just right and gave it a little snap with my wrist and away she flew . DANA Bad news , Floyd , if that letter ever gets into the hands of a stranger . Anybody could pick that letter up . Anybody at any time . They might even go all the way . With a letter like that you 've got a free ticket into almost anything you 'd like . Who knows , someone could even start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it even . Or charge free meals at Duke 's expense or  --  ( FLOYD stops playing and stands slowly , then crosses over to DUKE and puts his arm around his shoulders . ) FLOYD There 's something bigger going on than that , Dana . We can handle that without too much sweat or pain . Right now the thing that bothers us more and more , my colleagues and I , is when will Duke produce for us his next hit tune . When is it that Duke will come to us with a shiny new tune that we can sell . Duke knows of course about his date in Phoenix coming up within the week . And he also knows that that date can be easily filled with his one original , million-dollar , gold-label , award- winning song , " Prisoners , Get Up out of Your Homemade Beds , " and the rest of the evening can be spent with Duke singing songs from other artists ' repertoires , but when is it that Dukie will come to us and say look Floyd I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my next hit ? p. 8 DUKE I do n't know , Floyd . I 'm stuck . FLOYD But he will . It just takes time . And before you know it there it is staring you in the face . It was there all along but he just could n't see but now he sees with his own two eyes and his eyes light up like never before because he knows he 's got it now . He knows he can show it to Floyd and then Floyd can show it to the world and the world will see it for the very first time and the world will say we were just stuck before but now Dukie 's come through and shown us the way . DANA He 's been trying , Floyd . ( FLOYD digs his fingers into the back of DUKE 'S neck . ) FLOYD Then everything just falls off Dukie 's back . There 's a general relief for Dukie and the pressure he felt in the back of his neck is gone forever and ever . And he does n't know how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from DUKE and heads toward the door ) There 'll be two guitarists here at two o'clock sharp and I 've told them to be at your complete disposal . They 'll give you all the time you need but you 'd better use it because they cost twenty-five an hour plus tips so I do n't want any clowning around . Dana , you get Duke whatever he needs , coffee or anything , and see that he stays up here until something gets done . And do n't bother him about trivia because that 's for me and my men to deal with and no one else . Is that clear ? I 'll be back here at six to see how things are shaping up . Good luck . ( He exits . As soon as he closes the door the band stands and begins this song and DANA and DUKE do the frug onstage ; this song should be loud and fast. ) p. 9 #1 BAND SONGWell ya ' grew up smallThen ya ' grew up bigAnd the folks in townAsk ya ' what ya ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they said to youDo n't let yourself get caughtJust jerkin ' off behind some dark tree'Cause the neighbor 's kid got caught doin ' thatAnd a ' course ya ' know where he wound up atHe 's now in either Sing Sing or Alcatraz or eitherSing Sing or Alcatraz or The county zooIt 's no good for you , boyIt 's no good for you .

( DANA and DUKE finish dancing and applaud the band , the band bows and the play continues . ) DUKE Dana . p. 10 DANA What ? DUKE Do you have some scissors around ? DANA No . Why ? ( DUKE reaches into his pocket and pulls out a roll of bills . ) DUKE Take this and go downstairs somewhere to a scissors shop and buy a pair and then come right back up . DANA What for ? ( she takes the money ) DUKE Do as I say ! You 're supposed to get me what I want . DANA All right but you 'd better get down to work or it 'll be bad news all the way around . DUKE Take off , chick ! DANA Scissors . ( She exits , DUKE crosses down and bows to the audience , then sings . ) DUKE My baby 's goneWhere did she goI loved her soWhy did she goShe left me by myselfShe left me in a tranceAnd I could n't even dance forDays and days . My baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to chewI 'm so very blue ( He stomps his foot , the band boos him , DUKE gives them the finger , DANA enters with scissors. ) p. 11 DANA Scissors . DUKE Beautiful . Now cut my hair . DANA What ! ( DUKE crosses to the sofa and sits . ) DUKE I want you to cut off all my hair and then I have a surprise for you . DANA Duke , you ca n't do that . You have a date to do . You ca n't ! You ca n't ! You ca n't do that . DUKE Dana , I 'm stuck . You know I 'm stuck and I know it . But I have a surprise for everyone . I have a love song to sing but it has to correspond with the way . I look or it just wo n't work . Now please cut my hair or I 'll be stuck forever . DANA But Duke  --  ( There is a loud knock at the door . ) DANA Who is it ? ( Another knock . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) DANA Who is it , please ? ( A voice comes from the other side . ) DRAKE 'S VOICE It 's Drake , baby . Open up . DANA Duke , it 's your brother . What shall I do ? Oh what shall I do , Duke ? Oh what can I do ? p. 12 DUKE Let him in . ( DANA opens the door and DRAKE DURGENS enters with his friend CISCO ; they both have long hair , shades , and are dressed exactly like DUKE . ) DANA Hello , Drake . ( CISCO goes to the piano and starts playing " Chopsticks . " ) DRAKE Howdy . Nothing going on here , eh ? That 's funny , Dukie . Every time we come around here there 's nothing going on . How do you account for that ? DUKE Must be the time of year . DRAKE Could n't be that , baby , since we been here at all seasons and hours and the same nothing keeps going on . Do n't you write or something ? Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gaps ? DANA Duke works all the time . There are n't any gaps to fill . DRAKE Ca n't expect one song to last you forever , Duke . What 's the average duration of a hit like yours ? What would you say offhand ? Just candidly ? DUKE I could n't say . I 'm not a sociologist . DRAKE I 'd make a rough guess of about eight months , maybe nine . No more than that . DUKE Could be . p. 13 DRAKE ' Course with a swinging head like yours you should have no trouble . You should have the mothers rolling out as fast as they come in . You know , a song a day at the very least . Maybe two if the climate 's right . You know , if you 're really tuned in to what 's going on out in the streets . And given of course if the streets are tuned in to what 's going on in the jukebox . It 's like a circle , Dukie . You got to keep turning . Right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hair cut now so if you could go away for a while  --  ( CISCO stops playing the piano and stands , DUKE stands . ) DUKE Dana , shut up ! DRAKE Dukie 's cutting his hair ? No . CISCO You 're cutting your hair ? DUKE Look , Drake , I have some new songs that Floyd needs . I mean I 've written a new love song and I need to change my hair for it . You know what I mean ? DRAKE Sure , baby . I understand . DUKE It 's not so drastic as all that . It 'll grow back again . I 'm sure of it . DRAKE Sure . Here , Dana , let 's have those . ( he takes the scissors from DANA and crosses up to DUKE ) It 's not so bad , Dukie . It 'll just be like it was before you decided to let it grow . It 'll just be shorter , that 's all . ( he backs DUKE up until DUKE sits back down on the sofa with DRAKE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Try to think of something else if this bothers you at all . It wo n't be painful , in any case . And like you say , it 'll all grow back in case you change your mind . p. 14 DUKE I know , Drake , but I 'm  --  DRAKE Shhhh . Cisco might even sing us a song if we just relax . If we take it easy and do n't worry about anything at all . Cisco , what do you say ? You sing our song , baby . Our own original song . And I 'll cut Dukie 's hair and Dukie will just relax and maybe Dana will hum or something . How does that sound , Dana ? DANA I suppose . But be careful . He has a date to do . CISCO What song , Drake ? DRAKE Sing the song we wrote last year in the bar across the street . The song we wrote at the table where Dukie was with us drinking wine and smiling . DANA What song was that ? DRAKE You were n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Cisco .

Well you do n't know how you decided this , All that you know is there 's somethin ' you missedBut you do n't know what and you do n't know whereSo you just stay put and ya ' go nowhere . Oh prisoners , wo n't you get up out a ' your homemade beds , Oh prisoners , wo n't you get up out a ' your homemade beds . Well early one night you got so very uptightAnd you said this sleepin ' it just ai n't rightBut there was nothin ' at all that you could do'Cause your eyes stayed shut with your homemade glue . ( DANA starts yelling but DUKE just sits and lets DRAKE cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DANA Stop it ! Stop it ! That 's Duke 's song ! Stop singing ! Stop it ! I 'll call the police ! CISCO But you could n't hear your own voice speakAnd ya ' could n't walk ' cause your legs was too weakSo ya ' lay in bed cryin ' to yourselfAnd your life just sat there hanging on the shelf . Oh prisoners , get up out a ' your homemade beds , Oh prisoners , get up out a ' your homemade beds . And now the day and night are just the sameAnd now the light and dark do n't have no nameAnd you just lay in bed without no gameAnd you just lay there sleepin ' without no fame . But when you do awaken from your deep sleepThe bed will disappear and you wo n't even weep , You 'll walk right outside without no name , You 'll walk right outside from where you came . So prisoners , get up out a ' your homemade beds , Oh prisoners , get up out a ' your homemade heads . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lousy bastards ! Duke , they stole your song ! Duke wrote that song , not you ! DRAKE ( still cutting DUKE 'S hair while DUKE just sits passively ) Duke sold the song . Did n't you , Dukie ? p. 16 DANA He wrote it , too ! I remember the night he came home with it in his head . He came right through that door and he said darling I have a song ! I have a beautiful , beautiful song with a protest message and poetry and everything . And I said I 'm so happy and we both sat down right here and went to work on it . It took us four and a half hours because I timed it . And when it was done we played it on the piano and sang it and ran around here laughing and singing . And we called up this guy named Floyd and sang it to him over the phone and Floyd said we 'll cut . it tomorrow morning early and we did and within a week it was number ten on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it jumped to number two and at last by the end of the month it was number one and the biggest smash hit this country had ever heard or seen before . Is n't that right , Duke ! Ask Duke , he 'll tell you . Go ahead and ask him ! Ask him . Ask him . Go ahead and ask him . CISCO Shall I play another song ? DRAKE What did you have in mind , Cisco ? CISCO Something simple . DANA No more songs ! You both have to go now . Go on ! Get out of here ! We 're expecting a couple a ' musicians to come and help Duke . Now go on ! ( CISCO sets down the guitar and goes to the piano and starts playing " Chopsticks " again. ) p. 17 DUKE It 's all right , Dana . DANA What do you mean ! They 've accused you , Duke . They 've accused you of stealing . Your own brother ! Your own brother and your brother 's friend . ( DUKE stands with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to play " Chopsticks . " ) DUKE Dana , I want you to do me a favor . I want you to throw everything you heard out of your head and go downstairs and buy me a black suit and tie and some black shoes and a white shirt . I want you to do that now and come back as fast as you can . Please . It 's very important . ( he pulls out another roll of bills and hands it to her ) DANA You really did steal that song , did n't you ! ( she takes the money ) DUKE Now go on , Dana . DANA You did ! You stole it from your very own brother . I remember now because when you came in that night you said your brother was singing this groovy song but you had a better one . It was the same one , though ! It was ! How could you , Duke ! DUKE No , Dana . That night I was talking with Floyd . Now go get my suit ! DANA I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( She throws the money at DUKE and turns to go out the door as FLOYD enters ) p. 18 FLOYD Great ! Do I have to get a special guardian to guard you people and watch you to make sure you do your work ? Is that what I have to do ? All right ! I 'll do it . ( He opens the door and whistles , CISCO continues to play " Chopsticks . " ) FLOYD Peter ! On the double ! ( PETER , a bodyguard , enters wearing a guard 's uniform complete with pistol and badge and holding a billy club ; he also wears shades . ) DANA Floyd , Duke 's an impostor . He stole that song that 's made you rich . It is n't even his . FLOYD This is Peter . He 's completely trained and attuned to  --  stop that silly music !

You 've killed my Duke . ( she kneels at his side , sobbing ) p. 19 FLOYD Shut up , broad . He 'll come to in a second and then you can all get down to business . I said I wanted a new song and I 'm going to get one . DANA Not out of Duke ! He 'll never sing again ! FLOYD Then somebody else . How about you ? ( he crosses to DRAKE ) DRAKE I accompany , I do n't sing . ( DANA rises . ) DANA Do n't believe him , Floyd . He sings . In fact he sings very well . He even writes his own tunes . Original ones . FLOYD Original , eh ? Well , let 's hear some . What 's your name , boy ? DRAKE Cisco . FLOYD Well , Cisco , who knows , we may even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it takes . DANA He 's Duke 's brother , Floyd . His name is Drake Durgens . DRAKE Actually Drake writes all the songs and I just accompany . ( FLOYD turns to CISCO . ) FLOYD Is that right ? Well Drake , could you sing a few for us ? CISCO I just did . DANA It 's the other way around . He 's Cisco , not Drake . They 're lying to you , Floyd ! p. 20 FLOYD What difference ? He has a song that he 'd like to sing and we 'd like to hear it . Right , Drake ? CISCO I just sang it . FLOYD Well , sing it again , boy . DANA No ! If you sing that song , Cisco , I 'll kill you ! That 's not your song ! You have no right to sing that song . FLOYD Peter ! Take this girl and hold her and then take out your pistol and put it to her head and if these guys do n't sing by the time I count to five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructions . ) DANA No ! You ca n't sing that song ! That 's not your song ! They stole Duke 's song , Floyd ! ( PETER covers her mouth and holds the pistol to her head ! ) FLOYD One ! Two ! Three ! Four ! Five ! ( PETER fires the pistol , it makes a tremendous boom , DANA falls to the floor . ) FLOYD What did you do ! What in the hell did you do ! PETER I pulled the trigger . FLOYD You pulled the trigger ! Do you realize what you 've done ! Look at what you 've done ! PETER I know . p. 21 FLOYD Are you two going to play ball now or not ? Look what 's happened on account of your negligence . ( DUKE starts to groan and slowly gets up , rubbing his head ; FLOYD rushes to him and helps him up . ) FLOYD Dukie ! Oh Dukie baby , they 've killed your girl . They 've killed your sweet little girl by just plain old not cooperating . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just look at that . Is n't that a shame ? DUKE She 's dead . Oh my God . FLOYD Yes , Duke , I 'm afraid so . DUKE Did she get my suit ? FLOYD Your suit ? ( CISCO crosses to the piano again and starts to play " Chopsticks " ; DRAKE crosses up to DANA and kneels down beside her as DUKE walks around the stage in a daze , followed by FLOYD . ) DUKE She was going to get a suit . Black with a tie and white shirt with black shining shoes and buttons . FLOYD Duke ! What has happened to your hair ! Oh my God ! ( DUKE feels his hair . ) DUKE It 's there . It 's always there . In the summer it 's short and grows long in the winter on account of the changing climate . I never have to do a thing . It just corresponds itself to the climate and that 's that . I never knew anything like it before . But it 's been going on for as long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duke ! What will they say in Phoenix ? They wo n't even know who you are . They 'll laugh you right off the stage ! DUKE I tell them look , I 've been around for a century with changing hair on my head . My pubic hair remains constant but the head manages by itself . It comes and goes . Long and short . Thick and thin . And there 's nothing to do about that . If you lose your hair it 's gone and you just realize one day that it 's thinner than before . That 's all . FLOYD Stop playing that music ! ( CISCO stops , the band stands and begins this song which should be slower and somewhat softer than the first ; all the actors dance individually around the stage except DANA , who remains dead on the floor. ) #2 BAND SONGWell now that you 're older than ya ' was beforeAnd ya ' can tell that you 're older'Cause everything is a boreWell now that you 're clumsy instead of so quickAnd now that your headSeems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay on the floor , Who 'll brush your long hairWhile you just sit and stareAt the friends all around youWho pump you and pound youFor the truth you ca n't seeFor either them or either me'Cause we 're sunk on the groundAnd your heart do n't even poundWhile you lay on the floorAnd they just ask you for moreOf the same that ya ' gave , Of the same that they took , But they all want a lookAt the black secret bookThat ya ' lost from your handWhen your hand hit the pageAnd the page turned to fireAnd the fire burned your armAnd your arm burned your chestAnd all of your lovin ' friends they all know the rest So now that you 're down flat on the groundAll of your friends create the sound , All of your pals create the poundOf the sound of the song that they all want you to hearBut your ears ca n't begin'Cause they 're all jammed up with tearsFrom your eyes that both watch the yearsAnd the years that watch your eyes disguise your fearsSo please tell me now when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your back , Who 'll destroy your pride While ya ' lay on your side , Who 'll ease you with graceWhile ya ' lay on your face , Who 'll coax your short hairSo it does n't stay bare , Who 'll give you the sign to resign from your sleep , Who 'll give you some sleep to resign from the testOf your arm and your chestThat got burned with the restWhen your zest turned to jellyInside your bellyBut do n't worry now , whatever you do , Just do your dance and forget about who So now that you 're youngerThan ya ' was beforeAnd ya ' can tell that you 're younger'Cause ya ' do n't mind the floorWhere you crawl up and downWith your nose to the groundAnd ya ' do n't mind the smell'Cause you ca n't even tellThe difference ' tween heaven and hell anymoreAnd the floor and the skyShine right through your eyeAnd ya ' sigh and ya ' groanBut ya ' ca n't pick the boneOf the dead that wo n't dieAnd their sigh and their groanMatch right with the tone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , Just do your dance and forget about who , Just say your prayers and go softly upstairs , Just eat your food ' cause nobody cares , And nobody dares to say prayers in the streetAnd the street does n't care if ya ' just sit and eatSo eat while ya ' can and it all might come true'Cause who is around who can tell what to doAnd who is around who can save you from you , Who is around who can save you from you ?

PETER I do n't know . We 're not supposed to let unauthorized personnel touch or handle any of our  --  FLOYD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pistol out and hands it to FLOYD . ) FLOYD That 's a boy . And you two had better come up with some new songs or it 'll be badnews for you both . Good luck . ( He exits , PETER starts hitting the club against the palm of his hand. ) p. 24 PETER Stand back away from the body , Cisco . ( DRAKE moves away . ) DRAKE My name is Drake , if you do n't mind . Drake Durgens . PETER Let me tell you all something to start things off with . First of all , I 'm thoroughly trained and attuned to every possible kind of devious methods and trickery that you could possibly pull as a means of escape and/or assault . ( he begins moving around the stage , slapping the club into his palm more firmly ) I have no doubts that you know more than me either collectively or individually . It may even be possible that singly or collectively you may be even smarter than me in certain areas or even in most areas but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place and situation . In this particularly unique circumstance I have everything in my control simply because I was once in a position exactly like yourselves . Given that one simple little historical fact , I now have indisputably the upper hand . Not simply because I have a weapon but because I exhausted every possible avenue of escape once myself when I was exactly like you are now . And I tried every one . I tried possibility after possibility over a period of ten years until at last one of them worked . The very last one . And I was free for the very first time . So you see , here I am . The one and only person here who knows what that possibility is and the one and only person who wo n't tell . And the one and only person to stop any one of you if you happen to accidentally come across it , either singly or collectively . And God help you if you do . p. 25 DUKE Look , Peter , my name 's Duke and I 'm a singer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no need for introductions here . DUKE I 'm not introducing . I 'm telling you my actual life . I was a singer , a very popular singer with very long hair , a girl friend , and a song that I stole from my brother Drake over a bottle of wine across the street . But nobody knew that and the song became a fantastic hit , a beautiful smashing hit . I was admired from coast to coast by the people dearest to me and closest to my heart . By the people of my generation . I was admired and cherished because the song was true and good and reflected accurately the emotions , thoughts and feelings of our time and place . ( The band cheers . ) DUKE Thank you . But it was the only song I had . The only one . And I became stuck , Peter . I got stuck somewhere in the middle between  --  ( he crosses up to the photographs and points first to Bob Dylan and then to Robert Goulet ) Between him and him . Somewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a brand-new song . For a song like the one I 'd sung before or even just for any song . So I made up a love song and cut my hair so I 'd look like a lover . ( The band boos. ) p. 26 DUKE And then the theft of my unoriginal song was revealed and my girl was killed and my brother was hired to accompany me and Floyd said I could n't go to Phoenix looking like this , without any hair and without a song . So you see , I have no business here anymore . I 'm only in your way so I 'd like permission to leave , please . I 'm not stuck anymore , Peter , and I 'd just like to leave before Floyd gets back . ( he breaks down in tears ) PETER I suppose you figure the simplicity of your plea would give the impression to anyone of absolute sincerity but I can see right through that to the real truth of the matter and it turns out to be a lie . DUKE Peter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no business here ! DRAKE He 's right , Peter . He 's my brother and I can vouch for that . He 's telling your the truth . CISCO Me too . Even though he 's a thief , he 's telling the truth . PETER Oh well , all right . Step right up , Dukie old boy . Just step right out the door there . You 're free to go now . I mean , you have all these vouchers and everything so help yourself . DUKE Really ? PETER Of course . Be my guest . Right this way . p. 27 DUKE Thanks a lot . Thanks , Drake . Cisco . I hope things turn out all right in Phoenix . Say good-bye to Floyd for me , will you ? And I 'm sorry about the song and everything . DRAKE Sure thing , Duke . Good luck . CISCO So long . ( DUKE makes for the door and PETER slugs him on the back of the head with the club , DUKE falls to the ground . ) DRAKE That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you two should sit together on the couch and also that you should put your hands on top of your heads as an added precaution . ( They do so and cross to the sofa and sit . ) CISCO We 're supposed to be working , Peter . We have a date in Phoenix coming up soon . We ca n't just clown around . PETER Do n't worry about that . As soon as we 're clear on where we stand , then we 'll start thinking about work . DRAKE Floyd 's coming back pretty soon and it 'll be bad news all the way around if we do n't have something new for him to hear . PETER We 'll have something . Just sit tight . But first of all I have a personal question I 'd like to ask you boys before we do anything else . p. 28 DRAKE What do you mean ? ( PETER walks up and down in front of them , slapping the club into his palm . ) PETER I 'd like to redirect the attention for just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Just for a change . I 'd like to ask you both what you think of me as a person . Just frankly . Do n't be afraid of hurting my feelings or anything like that . Just tell me what you think . CISCO Well  --  PETER I 'd like Cisco to answer first , please . CISCO I 'm Cisco . PETER Now do n't start that shit , goddam it ! I 'm giving you both a chance to relax and feel more comfortable in this already slightly uncomfortable situation and what do you do ! You start pulling shit with me ! All right . Now then . Give yourself a moment to catch your breath , Cisco , and answer my question as best as you can . DRAKE Well I think  --  PETER Just relax for a second and then start in . Do n't start in right off the bat . Now are you ready ? DRAKE Yes . PETER Then answer me ! DRAKE I think you 're a fairly nice guy , Peter , but  --  p. 29 PETER Now do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " that fits anyone . Anyone 's a nice guy . DRAKE I know but you 're a specific kind . PETER What kind ? DRAKE Well  --  CISCO Peter , maybe if you told us a little about your past life , then maybe we could be more accurate . You could fill in the gaps , so to speak . PETER Did n't I just say I wanted Cisco 's answer and not yours . CISCO I guess . PETER But you answered , did n't you ! Did n't you ! Answer me ! CISCO Yes . PETER You can go now . I want to be alone with Cisco . I said you could go ! CISCO All right . You 're not going to hit me ? PETER Drake , do n't be silly . CISCO All right . ( CISCO gets up and crosses to the door , PETER watches him ; CISCO turns the doorknob but the door wo n't open , he tries again . ) CISCO The door 's locked , Peter . PETER Do n't be silly . ( Peter crosses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you see . p. 30 CISCO Oh . Thanks . So long . PETER Have a good time , Drake . ( CISCO makes to go out the door and PETER slugs him with his club , CISCO falls to the ground , DRAKE stands . ) PETER Sit back down , there ! ( DRAKE sits again with his hands on his head ; PETER pulls CISCO into the room and shuts the door , then crosses slowly back up to DRAKE . ) DRAKE Look , I really have to get down to work before Floyd gets back . PETER We will , Cisco . We 'll work all we want just as soon as you answer my question . It 's a very simple question really . All it requires is an unbiased opinion of my character . There 's no right or wrong answer in this case . It 's just a straightforward opinion . That 's all . Then you 're free to work . DRAKE Well , I 've known you such a short time , Peter . It seems so  --  PETER I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I feel somewhat obligated to fill you in on my brief background . Now listen very carefully and see what you can pick up . Anything at all that might be helpful in your answering . One night , several years ago when I was sixteen , I 'd just arrived in a very huge city . It does n't matter which one . ( he begins pacing slowly around the stage , slapping his club ) The point is I 'd come out of the hills where I 'd lived up until that point with my father and two brothers and several sheep . On this particular night I was walking along very early in the morning by myself with nobody else around . I 'd been walking for quite some time , listening to my steps , when I suddenly saw this man about a block ahead of me crawling along the curb and coughing very loud . I did n't change my pace at all but nevertheless gradually caught up to him since he was crawling very slowly and not making much headway at all . When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead and kept at my constant pace but I could hear him coughing and crawling along the curb . Well I 'd walked maybe twenty yards when I discovered he was still alongside me but I had n't looked down this whole time . I could just hear him crawling along and hacking away and it even made me feel slightly good . Like having a dog at your side in the early morning . Do you see what I mean ? p. 31 DRAKE Yes . PETER Well that comforting feeling lasted for a while but then began to leave me and be substituted by a kind of panic since by this time I 'd walked some sixty yards and the man was still with me . I decided to speed up my pace a bit and even got to the point where I was jogging but all the time he was right at my side and his coughing changed to panting and his crawling changed to trotting . So I stopped , thinking he 'd go right on by and disappear up the street , but he stopped too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us just stayed in one place , not seeing each other but knowing we were both there . Then I turned my head just slightly over my shoulder and sort of glanced down into his face and his face had no eyes . Mind you , they were n't eyes that had gone bad and closed up or white eyes that were glazed over or eyes like a blind man has . There were n't any eyes there at all . Just a mouth and nose and ears and everything else . Then I asked him what he wanted with me and why he was tagging along and if I could be of any help at all . And he spoke very clearly without any accent at all and no trace of slurred vowels or consonants . He was perfectly sober and he asked me if I 'd please bend down and read the address to him off a metal tag he had hanging from his neck on a silver chain . And I said why not and bent down and held the tag in the palm of my hand and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I read " Arizona " to him very loudly in his left ear for fear he was deaf , but he was n't since he jumped a little at the sound . Then he asked if I would please point him in the right direction for Arizona and I said of course and turned him around the opposite way and patted him on the back and off he went on all fours . I watched him for quite some time going right up the middle of the street and getting smaller and smaller when suddenly I felt this hand on my right shoulder and jumped slightly and turned and looked right at the face of this very old policeman in a long blue coat and a badge and a hat and boots and a club and a gun and he said to me was that a friend of yours and I said no and then he asked what business I had with him . So I told him what I just told you . Word for word . Exactly , precisely , without leaving one thing out . Without even coloring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put his hand around the back of my neck and dug his thumb into one side and the rest of his fingers into the other side and he led me by the neck into the doorway of a building where everyone was fast asleep . He led me right down this hallway by the back of my neck and there were only a couple of lights and he took me way in the back behind this staircase where everything was damp and dark and told me to take off my pants . ( There is a loud knock at the door , PETER jumps , DRAKE stands up. ) p. 32 PETER Sit back down there ! ( DRAKE sits . ) PETER Who is it ! VOICE We come to get the body ! Floyd sent us . PETER There ai n't no body here ! You got the wrong door ! VOICE It 's the right number ! This is where we 're supposed to come , all right ! PETER You better get away from here or we 'll call a cop ! VOICE Look , buster . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to break the door down ! So open up or we 'll do what he says ! PETER I have specific instructions not to let anyone in or out ! I do n't know you ! You could be anyone . How do I know who you are ? VOICE Well we 'll go get Floyd then and you 'll see who we are . PETER Go ahead ! VOICE You 'll be sorry , punk ! DRAKE Peter , we have to do something before he gets back . He 's a desperate man . He needs a new song and he 'll stop at nothing to get it . PETER You 're probably right . But you have n't answered my question yet and until you do there 'll be no chance at all to learn anything new . ( PETER unbuttons his pants and takes them off while DRAKE stays seated on the sofa. ) p. 33 DRAKE What can I say ? I like you very much . PETER That explains nothing to me . I want to know what I 'm like , that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of it , though . If you like someone it 's usually because they 're nice . I mean , I do n't like any bad guys . PETER You do n't ? DRAKE Well no . Do you ? PETER I never met one . ( As soon as he 's taken off his pants he crosses to the piano and starts to play " Chopsticks " while DRAKE stays sitting on the sofa . ) DRAKE It seems like you could get someone else to tell you what you 're like . Someone who knows you better . Someone who 's close to you and lived with you for a while . I mean what do you want , Peter ? I 've never done this kind of thing before . Peter ! ( DRAKE stands but PETER keeps playing " Chopsticks . " ) DRAKE We 're in a dangerous situation here ! The two of us . They 're not going to treat you any different than they are me . When Floyd gets back he 's going to be pretty pissed off at you for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you down the same as me . In fact he 'll probably hire you on to go with me to Phoenix , seeing as how you play the piano so well and also now that Cisco 's out of commission . Peter , are you listening to me ! ( DRAKE starts moving slowly toward PETER as PETER continues to play , ignoring DRAKE. ) p. 34 DRAKE This is no joke ! I ca n't give you what you want because I do n't know what it is . I ca n't just make it up . I could , I guess . Do you want me to make it up , Peter ? Peter ! ( PETER stops playing abruptly , there is a loud knock on the door ; PETER wheels around on the piano stool and grabs DRAKE ; he puts his hand over DRAKE 'S mouth and bends one of DRAKE 'S arms behind his back . ) FLOYD 'S VOICE Peter ! This is Floyd and his men ! Now listen , we know you 're inside there ! And I realize that I gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one out but now I 'm telling you the opposite . I 'm telling you to let us in . Do you hear me , Peter ! Open this door . PETER The problem is I ca n't be sure if you 're Floyd or if you 're more likely just some imposter who 's trying to mosey in on a good deal . FLOYD What good deal ! There 's nothing in there that could possibly be of any value to anyone but me . Now let me in this door ! ( The door shakes violently . ) PETER I 'm sorry . I 'm thoroughly trained and attuned to every possible  --  FLOYD All right , meathead ! You 're through ! Finished ! Washed up ! Down the river ! I 'm going out to get some cops and when I get back your thorough training ai n't going to be worth a hill of beans ! You 'll be blackballed from every guard corporation in the country ! You 'll never work again and that 's a promise ! Come on . ( PETER slowly lets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 35 DRAKE I told you . ( PETER hits him in the stomach with his club , DRAKE doubles over . ) PETER You 'd better think of something fast , boy . There 's no telling what they 'll do when they get back . Once they break down that door and come in here with guns . DRAKE Just let me sing a song , Peter . PETER You have n't answered my question yet . DRAKE I ca n't ! Do n't you see , I ca n't ! I like you very much ! I 've told you that . I 've told you you 're a nice guy ! PETER Good ! ( he slugs DRAKE in the back with the club ) Now what am I like when you look in my face ! DRAKE I ca n't see you , Peter ! PETER Come on , boy . They 'll be back very soon . You ca n't beat around the bush at a time like this . In a moment of crisis . DRAKE What do you want me to say ? PETER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking down the street alone , by yourself , and just accidentally ran across me in the dark . DRAKE But I did n't . PETER Pretend you saw me in a flash and we had a short encounter and then someone came up and asked you what you thought of that man you were just now talking to . What was he like , that man ? p. 36 DRAKE Peter , I ca n't ! I 'm stuck ! PETER And then you say whatever just comes into your head in that split second . Whatever happens to be sitting there in your memory of the second before and it just spiels out trippingly off the tongue . It just gushes out in its most accurate way . Word for word , without a moment 's hesitation to calculate where it 's going or how or why . It just falls out into the air and disappears as soon as it 's heard . That 's what I want to hear ! That 's what I want you to say to me . Right now , before it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Peter . Please . Let me make up a song for Floyd . PETER That 'll save your skin but how about mine ? What do you suggest for me , meathead ? DRAKE You could open the door . You could leave the door wide open so that when they arrive they wo n't be so mad at you . PETER Why not ? ( He slugs DRAKE again across the back , DRAKE falls to all fours . ) DRAKE Wait ! They  --  when they see the door wide open they 're liable to cool down and then they wo n't be so rough on you , Peter , because they 'll think you thought it over and reconsidered . Maybe they will . PETER Maybe you 're right , Drake . Maybe that 's a good idea . ( He goes to the door and opens it wide , DRAKE starts moving slowly around the stage on all fours as PETER follows him. ) p. 37 PETER There ! Now you 'd better get down to work , boy . You 'd better think up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By the way , thanks very much . I never would have thought of that possibility . The open-door routine . DRAKE That 's all right . ( DRAKE paces faster on all fours as PETER crosses slowly to the sofa and sits next to the radio . ) PETER I 'm not much good on songs , though . Wish I was , though , so I could help you out . I could play a little something on the piano if you want . Just something to help you get started . DRAKE No , I 'm all right . I 'll be okay . ( He paces faster up and down the apron of the stage while PETER just sits on the sofa , slapping the club in his lap . ) PETER It would n't be anything fancy , Drake . All I know is the simple stuff . But it might be just enough to kick something off for you . To get the wheels turning , so to speak . I 'm sure glad I 'm not in your shoes . DRAKE No , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starts humming some kind of tune now ) PETER Must be really something to have that kind of facility . To be able to make up a song whenever you feel like it . Just on the spur of the moment like that . How about the radio , Drake ? That might do the trick . What do you say ? ( PETER turns on the radio as DRAKE continues to pace up and down more frantically ; PETER just sits on the sofa , slapping the club in his lap , as the following comes from the radio. ) p. 38 RADIO : DANIEL DAMON 'S VOICE So I do hope we have given all of you somewhat of an indication of just exactly how the personal life of an artist is affected and/or altered by the reception of his work by the public at large . And we would like to thank our special guest tonight , Mr. Duke Durgens , for being so cooperative in this survey of ours and to wish him all the luck in the world . Duke , it 's been a pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DANNY 'S VOICE And now we would like to close out this evening 's session of the Corning Interview Hour with the sensational sound of the number-one hit tune in the world . Thank you for joining us and until next week this is Dan Damon saying  --  ( The song should break in extremely loud , over the radio . ) Well early one day you got out a ' bedAnd then you decided to go to sleep insteadSo early one day you got back in the sackAnd fell fast asleep in your homemade rack Well you do n't know how you decided this , All that you know is there 's somethin ' you missedBut you do n't know what and you do n't know whereSo you just stay put and ya ' go nowhere . ( DUKE gets up slowly and rubs his head , then exits quietly out the door ; PETER stays sitting on the sofa , keeping time to the song with his club ; DRAKE continues pacing up and down ; the band joins the radio at this point and sings along with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you get up out a ' your homemade beds , Oh prisoners , wo n't you get up out a ' your homemade beds . Well early one night you got so very uptightAnd you said this sleepin ' it just ai n't rightBut there was nothin ' at all that you could do'Cause your eyes stayed shut with your homemade glue . But you could n't hear your own voice speakAnd ya ' could n't walk ' cause your legs was too weakSo ya ' lay in bed cryin ' to yourselfAnd your life just sat there hanging on the shelf . ( CISCO gets up slowly and rubs his head , then exits quietly out the door ; the song continues . ) Oh prisoners , get up out a ' your homemade beds , Oh prisoners , get up out a ' your homemade beds . And now the day and night are just the sameAnd now the light and dark do n't have no nameAnd you just lay in bed without no gameAnd you just lay there sleepin ' without no fame But when you do awaken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't even weep , You 'll walk right outside without no name , You 'll walk right outside from where you came . ( DANA gets up slowly and yawns , then exits quietly . ) So prisoners , get up out a ' your homemade beds , Oh prisoners , get up out a ' your homemade heads . ( The song finishes , the band stops , PETER turns off the radio as DRAKE continues pacing , PETER gets up slowly and crosses to the door , he slams the door shut and turns to DRAKE ; DRAKE freezes in place staring at PETER , who crosses to DRAKE and stands over him for a while , tapping the club in his palm , then suddenly raises the club to hit DRAKE ; there is a loud knock at the door , the LIGHTS BLACK OUT. )
