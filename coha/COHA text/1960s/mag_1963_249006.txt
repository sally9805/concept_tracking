One wintry night in 1699 , in a rain-lashed Venetian tavern , a young artist named Marco Ricci killed a gondolier who had slighted his paintings . Had it not been for this murder , argue some Italian historians , 18th century Venetian landscape painting might never have thrived as it did . To keep Ricci from the law , his Uncle Sebastiano packed the young hothead off to Dalmatia , where the wild landscape inflamed his imagination . After the heat was off in Venice , which took four years , he returned , and his painting began to give new life to the coloristic Venetian tradition that had seemed over with the death of Tintoretto a century before . <P> Ricci became a much-commissioned , much-traveled painter and a foremost influence on others , but with his death in 1729 his fame ebbed away . In 1933 , a major Marco Ricci oil sold for a paltry $500 . Now renewed interest in Ricci has led to a retrospective of 228 of his works at the Palazzo Sturm near Venice , which before closing last week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $500 painting has been resold for $90,000 . <P> Painter Ricci did not , of course , learn all he knew in Dalmatia . Uncle Sebastiano taught him , and he was much swayed by Genoese oils filled with fantastic orgies of intertwined trees . A talented stage designer , he traveled to London to design sets for the Italian opera there . ( He could not resist turning out a few wicked caricatures of English operatic rehearsals , so satirical that they were long thought to be by Hogarth . ) He then began painting imaginary ruins , mingling fancy with the realistic landscapes . And this foretaste of rococo and romanticism created a whole new genre of painting , called caprices , that came to edge out the veduta , or popular views bought mainly by Englishmen gallivanting on the European grand tour as forerunners of today 's postcards . <P> His views of ruins swarm with gloomy shadows and tiny human figures scrambling ignorantly through the broken fragments of a past civilization . So much did he yearn for a picturesque rustic appearance that he painted his temperas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storm scenes along the seacoast . <P> When he was 52 , he attempted suicide several times , with a sword by his side so that he would die with the appearance of a knight . Finally he succeeded . But without the Venetian visionary 's work , such 18th century masterworks as the airy cityscapes of Canaletto and Guardi , the angel-frosted ceilings of Tiepolo and the imaginary prisons of Piranesi might never have come to grace great museums .
