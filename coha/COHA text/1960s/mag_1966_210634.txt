It was , said Rudolf Nureyev , like " graduating from finishing school , " a chance " to show what I learned about the West , and what I can do with it choreographically . " Last week at the Vienna State Opera , Nureyev presented Tancredi , his first try at choreographing a modern ballet . No pretty picture princes , no fluttering ballerinas in cupid wings this time . He turned the old love-triangle theme into an exploration of neurosis from womb to tomb , into a balletic adventure that was , as one critic put it , " for the Jung in heart . " <P> The role of Tancredi , danced by Nureyev , was conceived as the only flesh-and-blood character on stage ; the rest of the roles were grim and ghostly reflections of his troubled personality . To achieve a fittingly " queasy-uneasy " setting for the journey into the subconscious , Australian Set Designer Barry Kay studied various plants under a microscope , then conjured a shadowy , organic world streaked with veins like a bloodshot eyeball . Into this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life to face his first crisis . It comes in the form of two female images representing sacred and profane love . Torn between the two , he suffers a series of hallucinations and his second personality emerges . This leads to a violent , schizophrenic pas de quatre , and ultimately Tancredi No. 1 and Tancredi No. 2 are reduced to zero-death . <P> Future Step . The choreography for the 34-minute ballet was also slightly schizophrenic , a mixture rather than a melding of styles in which classical techniques alternated with the swivel and sway of modern dance . The action was fluent and quick moving . It spilled out in a stream of consciousness that followed no clearly defined course but swirled into moments of great beauty . What Nureyev 's flights of fancy lacked was strong musical accompaniment . Hans Werner Henze 's complex score was dense without being deep , an anemic , meandering work that undercut rather than underscored the choreography . Nureyev was forced to keep one foot in the classical past while trying to step into the future with the other . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let alone a Tancredi . <P> The critics , while baffled about the meaning of it all , generally agreed that in Tancredi , Nureyev displayed a new and fascinating side of his talent that is as up to date as tomorrow .
