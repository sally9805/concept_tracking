UP THE DOWN STAIRCASE by Bel Kaufman . 340 pages . Prentice-Hall $4.95 . <P> <P> New York City 's " Calvin Coolidge High " is an anachronism , up-to-date only in its paperwork . The guidance counselor records students ' negative motivations ; the nurse , their positive Wassermanns . But the faculty 's interest is , more clerical than clinical , and even dropouts are a problem more of tabulation than of salvation . After 15 years of teaching in schools like Coolidge , Bel Kaufman , a granddaughter of Yiddish Author Sholom Aleichem , in 1962 published a satirical anthology ( From a Teacher 's Wastebasket ) of staff directives , lesson plans , and faculty memos , and she has now extended it to novel length . But her characters-including the inevitable Fat Girl and the Fatuous Principal-are also mostly paperwork . A well-intentioned polemic turns out to be Our Miss Brooks in the Blackboard Jungle .
