THE GERMAN ATOMIC BOMB by David Irving . 329 pages . Simon &; Schuster. $6.95 . <P> In the spring of 1945 , with the Nazis on the verge of defeat , a small group of scientists crowded into a cave in southern Germany for one last attempt at starting a chain reaction in their uranium pile . It was far too late to produce an atomic bomb that could help the fatherland . But the scientists-unaware that the U.S. had accomplished the feat more than two years before-were determined that Germany should produce the world 's first nuclear chain reaction before the war ended . Their experiment , like the entire German A-bomb program , ended in failure . <P> To reconstruct the story of Germany 's A-bomb project , British Historian David Irving interviewed German scientists , studied recently declassified papers , and discovered a supply of captured German documents that had been lying unused and neglected for many years in an AEC warehouse at Oak Ridge , Tenn . From his meticulous research he has put together a chilling account of a project that might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or New York , rather than Hiroshima and Nagasaki to radioactive ashes . <P> Hamstrung Program . The Germans solved the theoretical problems and designed the devices that eventually could have produced an Abomb . They even conducted crude H-bomb experiments . But their scientific skills were not equal to the problems of dictatorial politics . When they tried to persuade their government of the importance of nuclear energy , German physicists pointedly avoided using the word bomb ; they were fearful that Hitler might order the immediate production of a nuclear weapon and hold them responsible if they failed to perfect one . Unconvinced of its military value , Nazi leaders gave their atomic energy program a relatively low priority ; they never came close to matching the tremendous expense and manpower poured into the U.S. Manhattan Project . <P> Historian Irving argues that lack of governmental support was the basic cause of the Nazis ' nuclear failure . But some of his anecdotes suggest that the German scientists themselves were at fault . After Physicist Walther Bothe calculated that graphite would not be an effective " moderator " - the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought to question him . Instead , the Germans turned to heavy water for a moderator . However , they were hamstrung for the remainder of the war when an Allied sabotage team crippled the world 's only heavy-water plant , at Vemork in occupied Norway . Meanwhile , Enrico Fermi had constructed the world 's first working uranium pile in Chicago-using graphite as a moderator . <P> Lethal Burst . Even if a respite from the incessant Allied bombing had given them more time , it now seems doubtful that German scientists could have worked their way past their repeated oversights and gaffes . When U.S. troops captured the site of the final uranium pile in Haigerloch , Germany , accompanying U.S. scientists were astonished to discover that the Germans had made absolutely no provision for protecting themselves against atomic radiation . Had a successful chain reaction begun on the day of the last test , the Nazis ' nuclear physicists would have been showered by a harmful , and perhaps lethal , burst of radiation .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
