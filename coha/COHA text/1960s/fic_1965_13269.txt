Greenland : In a hut , four Eskimos play the string game , and FATHER PAOLO BONTEMPO , a little priest from Malta , watches . KESAK This is a crack in the ice or a man 's behind . APNAK This is a seal or maybe a vulva . ( Grins at BONTEMPO ) Fada , is this a seal or a vulva ? BONTEMPO ( Patiently ) A seal . KATKA ( Laughing ) Fada has never satisfied himself with a woman and knows nothing of vulvas , of course , but he has seen a lot of seals . BONTEMPO ( His little hand rubs his shaved pate ) Do n't say it that way , so lewdly . ( He picks up a piece of frozen meat and sucks intensely ) Many men in my part of the world never marry , and sometimes for the highest reasons . And if I had , I would not be here with you . Coition is n't everything . NUGAK We do n't think so either ; too many children and not enough caribou . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her old mother on the ice because of the famine two years ago . Coition certainly is not everything ! p. 3 APNAK Listen to " good-by-stink " Nugak talk ! The biggest wife trader and enlarged organ ever to get lost in a blizzard  --  but he follows his nose and always finds a widow . ( Affectionately , with a tinge of envy ) You widow-diddler ! BONTEMPO ( Mildly ) Stop it , boys . ( Makes a string picture clumsily ) I think I 've made an angel or the Lord . What do you think , fellas ? Is it an angel or the Lord ? KESAK A fox trap or a woman 's breasts . APNAK Your picture is n't very clear , Fada . But it looks sort of like a vulva . But of a very old woman . BONTEMPO ( Angry ) No , it 's not a woman 's breasts or a fox trap , or that word again . Greasy little heathens  --  sex-minded ! ( He moves toward the far end of the hut and broods ) KATKA ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mad with us . You 're like a small child in this country . This is our way of not being bored , talking whatever comes into our heads when we look at the string pictures . NUGAK If he says it 's an angel or a lily of the field , okay . p. 4 APNAK What is a lily of the field ? KATKA A flower , a white flower . And an angel is a young girl with hair like the sun . APNAK ( Pulls out an old movie magazine and finds a picture of a blonde actress or a naked pin-up ) Here 's an angel . ( Kisses the picture ) I like her long eyelashes . KESAK Her hair is like the fur of the polar bear . BONTEMPO ( In good humor again ) See whatever God wills you to see , my little flock . But let us read together from the Holy Book . ( He takes the magazine away , folds it in half and sits on it ) APNAK Please read to us , Fada . We do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to save your eyesight because of the spirits who might want to take it if they knew you use it for books instead of hunting caribou . APNAK That 's right , I 'm afraid for my eyes . The spirits might become jealous , so you please read , Fada . BONTEMPO ( Takes a Bible out of his habit and reads from Leviticus , Chapter eleven , Restrictions on various meats ; the Eskimos stare and nod while he reads ; all of them except KATKA fall asleep ) Say to the children of Israel : These are the animals which ye are to eat of all the living things of the earth . Whatsoever hath the hoof divided , and cheweth the cud among the beasts , ye shall eat . But whatsoever cheweth indeed the cud , and hath a hoof , but divideth it not , as the camel , and others , that ye shall not eat , but shall reckon it among the unclean . The cherogrillus which cheweth the cud , but divideth not the hoof . And the swine , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cud . The flesh of these ye shall not eat , nor shall ye touch their carcasses , because they are unclean to you . These are the things that breed in the waters , and which it is lawful to eat . All that hath fins , all that hath fins , and scales , as well in the sea , as in the rivers , and the pools , ye shall eat . But whatsoever hath not fins and scales , of those things that move and live in the waters , shall be an abomination to you , and detestable : their flesh ye shall not eat , and their carcasses ye shall not touch . All that hath not fins and scales , in the waters , shall be unclean . Do not touch the eagle , and the griffon , and the osprey , and the kite , and the vulture , and the raven , the ostrich , and the owl , and the larus , and the hawk , and the screech owl , and the cormorant , and the ibis , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the houp also , and the bat . Of things that fly , whatsoever goeth upon four feet , shall be an abomination to you . But whatsoever walketh upon four feet but hath the legs behind longer , wherewith it hoppeth on the earth , that ye shall eat . But all the creeping things shall be abominable to you neither shall it be taken for meat . Whatsoever goeth upon the breast on four feet , or hath many feet , or trailing on the earth , ye shall not eat , because it is abominable . Do not defile your souls , nor touch aught thereof , lest ye be unclean . For I am the Lord your God . Be holy because I am holy . Defile not your mouth by any creeping thing , that moveth on the earth . For I am the Lord who brought you out of the land of Egypt , that I might be your God . Ye shall be holy because I am holy . This is the law of beasts and fowls , and of every living creature that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That ye may know the differences of the clean , and unclean , and know what ye ought to eat , and what not to eat . ( BONTEMPO finishes reading and looks at the sleeping men sadly . He lies down and cushions his head with his arms ) p. 5 KATKA ( Moves over to BONTEMPO and whispers ) Fada , we eat almost anything that we find . There are no olive trees here or orange-colored fruit or yellow-haired women . We are not in a land of milk and honey . We have lots of our own food taboos , like bear liver and heart and human meat . Nobody told you to come here , but we are glad that you 're with us . BONTEMPO Katka , where I come from the people are not made much differently from you . They too have short legs , but they are long on intelligence and love of God and the saints . And they were once given the word too . And now they keep the word very dear . I want your people to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good things seen in the string pictures . If you keep seeing bad things , you will get a leprosy on your eyes and mouth . Please , no more talk . Let me sleep . The storm will be over soon . God wills it so . KATKA ( Giving BONTEMPO a small kick ) I know you have the picture of a woman under your behind , Fada . A picture of a woman with golden hair the color of a starved rabbit 's shit ( Laughing very hard ) and do n't think I 'm afraid of a disease in your Bible , you **33;601;TOOLONG ! Listen , I really like you . We all really like you ! We do n't want you to leave . p. 6 BONTEMPO Leave ! ( Screaming ) I will never leave , until you are converted and your mothers ! Until the awful pleasure of exchanging wives is given up and the still awfuller pleasure of the women nursing their children and other people 's children and anybody in general till they are fourteen ! Why , the other day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his own right  --  nursing at the breast of Nugak 's wife ! KATKA But poor Banzak is an orphan and has stomach trouble . He can only take in milk . Whale and seal are too tough for him in his condition , and so he hunts for Nugak , who , of course , feels sorry for him and lets him take his wife 's breasts . That is just one kindness for another . BONTEMPO Katka , you only treat a slave like that . Not a wife ! The other way is a union full with the devil 's impulses ! How do you know Nugak 's wife likes it ? KATKA She does . I can tell by the smile on her face . Her eyes and nose become so small . I love a happy woman with a little nose . BONTEMPO There you are , Katka ! You have slept with Nugak 's wife ! KATKA Yes , and he has slept with mine . It 's wonderful to have a change from the same thing day after day . And men become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BONTEMPO Foulness ! And the women get jealous . KATKA Why ? They do n't wear out . They come back happy and as good as ever . But it 's up to the husband , one must get his permission . If not , the wife will be beaten . BONTEMPO But even the young girls , the unmarried ones , are prey to the men ! KATKA It 's her own business . She has to learn , and she has to find a mate , and they must like sleeping together . That is the right way . BONTEMPO It ca n't be ! Lasciviousness is never the way to heaven . And that is where the good go . And goodness knows lasciviousness is bad , evil for God 's sake ! Katka , wake up . ( Grabs and hugs and pushes him ) KATKA I am awake ! ( The other Eskimos wake up ) Here is a man who although white is very ignorant of our ways in the most northern part of the world and this indeed is the most northern part , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard him , at least I have , if you men have n't . I have heard him say that he is with men of another kind in the most northern part of the world and he , who comes from the most southern part of the world , and God I thought I knew the south , but only the south of this part of the world which is the north . That is the south I know . But in this south where there are olive trees and things called fruits , thin skins with plant juice and meat except not from an animal and other lovely things though I 've never myself seen a tree , but a priest does not lie about those things and an Eskimo does not lie either and will not either disbelieve a priest and a white man and he is both . But he keeps us curious in these nights of storm and I like him for that . p. 8 APNAK ( Rubbing his eyes and scratching ) I like him for the powder that he gave me for my lice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I still scratch . My wife resented me not having lice for a while , so I 'm glad to be on the good side of her . BONTEMPO That 's another thing that I do n't like about you people , your lice-biting of each other , it 's an odd and awful habit . I wish you 'd stop it ! APNAK A man may do what he likes with his wife or his lice , Fada . BONTEMPO ( Screaming ) We are our brother 's keeper ! We are . We are . KESAK Who are ? KATKA In his religion , somebody betrayed his brother and brings down the anger of the biggest spirit . NUGAK The big spirit . Not the biggest , just the big . BONTEMPO ( Righteously , to NUGAK ) See , you remember very well what I have told you about the Lord ! APNAK But you have told us nothing about the lice and why you do n't enjoy biting them . BONTEMPO Both names begin with L. But one is an abomination unto the other . The louse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we are parasites unto the Lord when we do n't listen to him . p. 9 KESAK But they 're tasty . They 're a bit like a sweet codfish . APNAK I think more like a very young child 's snot . KATKA That 's the wonder of them , the lice . They are different to each of us . My wife 's taste like flowers . BONTEMPO ( Hurt ) I had lice and was sent home from the school . My mother rarely washed my hair when I was little , she was a busy woman . There were many of us . Too much to do and wash my hair besides . . . fourteen children . . . KESAK I do n't see what is so bad about lice . Washing the hair is bad . Although a little urine on it will make it shine . NUGAK The Fada has a very good hair around his ears . On top he 's very smooth , like a breast of a woman . APNAK I like the Fada 's eyebrows , so full and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and eyebrows ? I never considered myself a handsome man , but I myself thought I had excellent hair . I had more of it when I was young . ( Italian music plays and the priest talks ; the Eskimos silently play string games and fall asleep ) Blue-black hair like a prince in a fairy tale , or a lovely Portuguese fisher boy , or a beautiful Maltese man . I was small . ( Smiles ) Still am , but I had fun . Not as much as I wanted , but ( Stretches ) blue-black hair . I was not like Franco , so tall , but neither was I like Mario , so short . I was Bontempo the medium-on-the-short-side . I do n't want to get snow blind . It happens so often with the whites , though luckily my eyes are dark and give added protection . . . the pigment . Broiled fish with a little olive oil and lemon . How long , Oh Lord ! Porgy , I would love some broiled porgy with a bit of oregano . ( Offstage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? p. 10 CECIL ( Offstage , masterfully ) Yawohl ! BONTEMPO ( Tired ) Enter . ( CECIL , the half-breed , comes in shuffling and suspicious . He glances at the men with contempt . They watch the following debate with great good humor and interest , cheering and booing at appropriate moments ) CECIL What is happening here ? Fada , what is up ? BONTEMPO You may be at ease now , Cecil . Nothing 's happening . We 're waiting for the storm to let up . CECIL Waiting for the storm to let up and playing string games ! Look , all around string ! It 's decadent ! ( Pronounces it " deeKAYdent " ) BONTEMPO God ! If only the other half of you was n't so German . CECIL That 's my better half . It 's what makes me realistic ! ( Points his arm viciously at the sleepers ) Not like these swine ! ( Pronounces it " schwine " ) BONTEMPO Schvine , you mimicker ! CECIL ( Enviously ) Well , you went to college ! p. 11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some words correctly . So I say sit down and be quiet . Let people sleep . CECIL No sleep . I have an excellent idea for all of us . We will become fishermen . It 's neater than meat . We 'll import herring like the Norwegians . BONTEMPO You are a dumb-head , yes ? CECIL Yawohl ! No ! We must not be on the dole . We should be in business like everybody else . I may sound like a European-lover , but . . . well , I am half ! But we should keep up with the rest of the nations and learn money . BONTEMPO Learn money ? What does that mean ? Like learn war ? You ca n't learn money . You either make it or you do n't . And we choose not to make it but to get it , and every now and then if and when we can , the supply is short , catch a seal or a very rare deer . But that 's not our fault . I mean , not the Eskimos . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat . It 's the others who killed too much . Your half , the better , and my all . NUGAK Cecil , you are a disgrace to the Eskimo race . CECIL That 's just half of me . You jealous thing . NUGAK Every time he comes in I am immediately aware of my killing instinct ! p. 12 APNAK Also he messes up the whole mood of these weekends . KESAK When I look at him , I feel I know why the caribou have gone . A salmon-cannery starter ! ( Contemptuously ) A fish-eater ! A tuna-screwer ! KATKA God ! And I really felt I was living like my grandfather and then he comes in . The dull-wit ! BONTEMPO Yes , he can spoil things , like a rotting onion . . . It 's hard to love . . . and always Cecil .

So important that things remain fine . STOREKEEPER Things remain fine , but you do n't have a dime without a government check , Eskimo ! ( STOREKEEPER laughs ) CECIL Just temporarily . A small while . STOREKEEPER The trouble with you people is that you 're not white . That 's where the trouble is . . . not being white ! CECIL There 's good and bad in all people . STOREKEEPER And you never have an original thing in your head . Good and bad in all people , hoo ! ( Two sexy white women enter ) FIRST WOMAN I want a large frying pan for French omelettes. p. 14 SECOND WOMAN Potholders too .

STOREKEEPER ( Gives CECIL the items and winks at the women ) Here y'are , Mister Eskimo , give the ladies the items . But first make sure to put them in a paper bag . And you may take the money and hand it to me . ( CECIL looks around for paper bags and then bends down to look under the shelves . STOREKEEPER makes grotesque faces for the women , who stifle their laughter ) The bags are over there ! p. 15 CECIL Where ? STOREKEEPER Over there , you dumbbell !

But I ca n't do it alone , and you schwine wo n't help me . ( The others click their tongues and sympathize , tongue-in-cheek ) APNAK Oh , too bad . Such terribleness on our behalf . KESAK We 're such fools . Why , oh why , ca n't we be full of brains ? KATKA Like Cecil , who 's so free of horse-shit . CECIL Horse-scheis ! KATKA Oh , yes , of course , scheis , the good German word . NUGAK Hey , Eskimos ! Let 's show Cecil that we can do something besides diddle with the strings . Let 's show him our little song and dance we 've been practicing . ( NUGAK winks ) KESAK Yes , yes .

NUGAK , KESAK AND KATKA ( Singing together ) I want them warm , young and tall . When their blood 's cold , I do n't like them . Milk and meat , that 's good too . What the hell are Vegetables ! They make our dogs piss . KATKA Now for the other one , boys . The one about my grandmother . ( Singing in high falsetto ) My hair 's in a knot . For going to bed with whalers , I get some sweetened water . I put it on my vulva to soothe the pain of gonorrhea that the whalers gave me . And now for one that we know you 'll like , Cecil .

That 's just how I feel . ( Laughing ) My wife , the fat seal . APNAK The fat seal kept our grandpaps very warm once . KESAK ( Bitterly ) But now we 're used to Swedish glug . . . You know we are proved wrong ! Glug 's better than blubber . KATKA Yeah , we 're proved wrong . Why eat a waterfowl when you can eat canned ham with tiny green peas ? NUGAK Eskimos eating ham in the modern world . Shit ! CECIL ( Proudly ) You know , Eskimos , shit is a Germanic word . KESAK You never are going to forget that your mother was jumped and that is how you were created , yeh ! ( Sardonically ) Without even the melody of Lohengrin .

Probably he said ( Loudly ) , " Comme here mein Fraulein and give me a kiss . " Romantic people , Germans are . KATKA ( Laughing ) And then he jumped her . CECIL No , no , they achieved coition ! Schwine ! ( KESAK laughs with the others ) No more talk about my parents ! ( Frantic ) Listen , let 's go into business making clay pipes . KESAK What about your herring idea ? CECIL It 's practical , but . . . ( He makes a face ) KESAK Herring is not good enough for you , and besides , they stink . CECIL They irritate my nasal passages .

BONTEMPO Did he like it ? KATKA I think he liked one song . Let 's do a song for the priest . Now listen , Fada , one day if we 're really good we 'll give up the string games for a while and visit a big city , maybe Copenhagen or Oslo , and try New York City later on . APNAK , KATKA AND NUGAK ( They hold hands on each other 's hips and sing ) We 're Eskimos , warm-hearted Joes in a cold cold land ho ho ho ho . p. 31 KATKA That one 's not perfected yet , Fada . ( He sings ) Here in this land the wind blow blow blow . Does that sound right ? Not to me . Oh well . ( He continues to sing ) Blow blow the wind goes . APNAK We 'll fix it up , but we 've got some others . KATKA Let 's do the heavenly one , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( He sings ) I cry in the morning of any weather . I feel so bad for my brother , with generosity I need an angel 's pity , my brother my brother O mine . APNAK That 's taken after an old Norwegian sea song . ( He sings ) He floats like a log on his back , all drunken all drunken all drunken ; the lovely brother of mine is sunken is sunken is sunken . BONTEMPO That 's good , but depressing . KATKA Ahh ! That makes me feel good . Your pleasure in our songs . Of course , they 're different from our own Eskimo folk songs . But in a way they 're a development . Depression is often a sign of worthy pleasure . p. 32 APNAK A worthy depression . BONTEMPO Please become shoe salesmen . KATKA Why ? BONTEMPO So I will lose my depression . APNAK You want too much , priest of need . NUGAK I say a priest should and does need a depression . KESAK Like an enema . NUGAK Should we become sellers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bontempo preaches shoes . BONTEMPO Bontempo wants to go home . KATKA Home to where , priest ? BONTEMPO A little village in Malta . I want the warmth . KATKA ( Turning to the others ) He wants the warmth . NUGAK Oh , the warmth . Yes , it is cold here . APNAK Kesak , guess . Who wants the warmth ? KESAK Little Bontempo . BONTEMPO Why are you mocking me ? p. 33 KESAK How can you tell ? BONTEMPO You called me little . KESAK Is it mockery to know a man 's size ? BONTEMPO I want to go home . It 's rushing from me , this want . Want to go home , want to go home . It sounds good to me . That piece of a sentence . APNAK Stop being gloomy . KESAK I 'd be gloomy if I was off the ice for as long as the priest has been on it . Different pot covers , all of us . NUGAK What a treatment for a man . Take him away from his homeland , make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a climate that 's cold ; wants his own . Tries to make natives into shoe sellers . APNAK If we become shoe salesmen , Bontempo goes home to Malta . How ? KESAK An arrangement . Bontempo has made an arrangement with Cecil . KATKA Somethings stinks in Greenland ! APNAK Yes , Cecil figures in this , I 'm sure . KESAK What has Cecil promised you , Fada ? BONTEMPO A lunch . p. 34 APNAK A hot lunch ? BONTEMPO Yes . I have chills . ( Shivers ) Hold me . APNAK What ? KESAK Why not . Come here , Fada . ( BONTEMPO goes to KESAK and the Eskimo sits him on his knees ) Better ? BONTEMPO A little . But rub my shoulders ; they feel a bit stiff . KESAK ( He rubs BONTEMPO 's shoulders ) Did he promise you a Maltese lunch ? BONTEMPO Not just Maltese . You can get it practically anywhere in the southern part of Europe . KESAK You never did like frozen meat the way we eat it , did you ? BONTEMPO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meat melt against them . APNAK You know , Fada , that is the best way to eat meat . It lasts much longer in the belly . NUGAK Do n't lecture the priest . People love their own . BONTEMPO Pasta , olive oil , Genoese sausages . Good , good . p. 35 KATKA Yes , we know . BONTEMPO Become what I want you to become . ( Hugs KESAK ) Say it tonight . KESAK How can I resist this priest ? It means too much to him . And he did play our game on the weekends . APNAK I am moved . I am really moved . NUGAK We can take care of Cecil . But we must give to Bontempo our understanding . BONTEMPO I want understanding . I do . NUGAK No , that really is n't it . You want a hot lunch . APNAK Remember the lore of the North . You understand a man when you feed him . KATKA I feel that we can say yes . APNAK Can I speak for us all , Eskimos ? ALL Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up from KESAK 's lap ) Thanks , thanks . I bless you also . ( BONTEMPO makes the sign of the cross and exits ) KATKA Nugak , you 're right . People do love their own . Food . Their own clothes . Sometimes their own women . p. 36 KESAK Ahh , it 's the outer world that wants to change the inner one . The foreign influences . APNAK I agree . There are outside influences . NUGAK Cecil the half-German feels his own outside . It wants to change his inner , which is this country . Greenland ber alles , thinks Cecil . APNAK And now he makes a priest forget his vows . KATKA Makes a lure for him of tomatoes and oil . Blackout @x BONTEMPO 's hut . He is sitting at his little table . It is set for two . He has his head on his arms and he hums along with the record of Italian music . Every now and then he looks up and smiles sweetly , then puts his head on his arms again . CECIL 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cecil ? CECIL Yawohl ! BONTEMPO ( Gaily ) Enter . ( CECIL walks in carrying a large case ; he puts it down in front of BONTEMPO ) CECIL Your food . BONTEMPO I know . ( Opens the case excitedly ) It 's here , the oil , pasta , tomato sauce , and the blessed sausages from Genoa . Four beautiful substances . CECIL Yawohl . It is to your taste . My own is heartier . Forceful people need a forcefuller food . BONTEMPO Yes . ( Not listening , but fingering the little bottles of oil , etc . ) Of course . I will prepare the delightful food for us . But a short while . My hands will bless the food as they prepare it for us. p. 38 CECIL You Maltese act so nonsensical about food ! BONTEMPO You mean you have known others ? CECIL Yawohl ! I know your type . ( BONTEMPO takes the case and exits . CECIL walks authoritatively around the room , poking his nose all over ) This is not a way to keep a hut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there must be organization . Any German can see that ! . . . and the priest 's sensual love of food . Unhealthy . ( BONTEMPO enters carrying two bowls of spaghetti . He sets them on the table ) BONTEMPO Preciousness . My lips , tongue , whole mouth will receive this preciousness . Heaven and earth shall pass away , but my desire shall not pass away . CECIL Yawohl ! Neither shall mine . But for business . A prosperous shoe business . BONTEMPO Let us eat . ( He takes up a fork and begins to eat ) Eat some warm food . CECIL ( Laughs ) Your face looks like an old grandmother 's waiting for kisses . BONTEMPO I have a great desire to open my mouth wide . I want you to see the mash . I 've made those lovely strings into a mash . p. 39 CECIL ( Shrilly ) You will not be disgusting in my presence ! You will not insult me ! BONTEMPO It is not an insult for me to open my mouth wide so you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and points a finger at it ) Look , look , Cecil . CECIL ( Pushes his own dish away ) I do n't want to look in your filthy mouth ! BONTEMPO Pulpy , there 's a pulpy mass in my mouth . It amazes me . How could I have eaten frozen meat before ? This mass in my mouth is so warm . CECIL Stop it ! Shut your mouth ! I feel nauseated . It looks like blood in your mouth . BONTEMPO Let me open my mouth as I want to , Cecil . It does no harm to you . CECIL My father taught us to keep our mouths closed when we chewed ! He was a good man ! Bontempo , if you open your mouth again , I will discipline you with a slap ! BONTEMPO ( Opens his mouth wider ) Cecil , look , look ! ( CECIL leans over and slaps BONTEMPO sharply on the face . BONTEMPO begins to cough and sputter . He falls off his seat and gasps while CECIL watches in amazement ) O Lord , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and ye gave me warm . . . ( BONTEMPO dies ) p. 40 CECIL ( Panicky ) I did not want him to choke . It was not my fault ! ( CECIL exits ) Blackout @x The four Eskimos are playing their string games when CECIL bursts in . CECIL It was not my fault ! I did not despise him ! ( The four look at him with interest ) KESAK Something was not Cecil 's fault ! APNAK Tell us what 's not your fault , Cecil . CECIL The priest choked to death on a hot lunch . NUGAK ( Turns to the others and they all sigh ) O he is home , he is home . CECIL It 's not my fault . NUGAK We can not go into business with you now . We can not be shoe salesmen . KESAK I feel very sad . I loved Bontempo . No , Cecil , none of us can sell shoes . CECIL Because I was with the priest when he died ? KATKA Yes . Death is too close to you now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Though we know really it was n't your fault . Still it would be unlucky to go into a business . p. 42 KESAK Especially at this time . Maybe next year . CECIL Next year , then . The shoes . APNAK Maybe Kesak 's right . Next year . KATKA Bontempo has the climate he wanted . KESAK The warmth . But not hell . He was n't a bad man . I 'm sure he 's not in hell . NUGAK Would he be considered a glutton according to his religion ? APNAK Who knows ? But he looked for peace . And there ca n't be a sin in that . CECIL So you say next year , about the shoe business ? APNAK Still thinking about industry , are n't you ? CECIL Well , we must be like other nations . " The hand of the diligent shall bear rule . " KATKA We four simples do not wish to rule . NUGAK You are a seducer , Cecil . You seduced the good Fada with the food . APNAK You 're a pig with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Fada and to us . We should leave you on the ice ! p. 43 CECIL It was not my fault that he died on food ! He thought the shoe business would be good for us too ! KESAK No , he really did n't care about money . He was a pious man . Though perhaps he loved a warm meal just a little too much . KATKA Who knows what is what ? Food , piety , gluttony . KESAK No gluttony . Fada just wanted some warmth . CECIL He was a glutton . He opened his mouth up so that I could see the chewed-up stuff ! NUGAK How dare you call Bontempo a glutton ! Cecil , you should wash your own mouth out with snow . KESAK Cecil , get out of our sights ! ( Pause . Nothing happens ) Raus ! CECIL Yawohl ! ( CECIL clicks his heels , does an about-face and exits ) NUGAK I hate to be sorrowful . Let 's have some glug and cheer up . . . ( Gets bottles and passes them around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , we wish it too . APNAK Let 's play a string game . I 'll make us something that will make us happy . ( Works the string ) What 's this ? p. 44 KATKA Two walruses . NUGAK A small boy peeing . KESAK A hunter or a woman fishing by an ice hole . APNAK ( Singing ) Ayorema . . . How wonderful for us all that God was born to make us friends of his in a land of happiness . . . bring your skins and your fat flesh to my poor house . This is a vulva of a seal . ( The Eskimos laugh ) ( END OF PLAY. )
