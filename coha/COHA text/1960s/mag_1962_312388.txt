MY BROTHER , ERNEST HEMINGWAY ( 283 pp. ) - Leicester Hemingway - World ( $4.95 ) . <P> <P> Ernest Hemingway continues posthumously to be good for the publishing business ; eight books and nonbooks are currently in print about him and his work , with more sure to come . The two latest are examples of sibling nonrivalry : Older Sister Marcelline 's clutch of childhood memories recently serialized in the monthly Atlantic , and this collection of Kid Brother Leicester 's reminiscences serialized in Playboy . <P> Leicester Hemingway , dubbed by Ernest " The Baron " for reasons unexplained , reveals himself as the archetypal kid brother . He was 16 years younger . He adored " Stein , " as he called him . And he took naturally to Stein 's patronizing pontifications on how to do anything , from landing a fish to landing a woman , and was happy to serve as batman , drink mixer , errand boy and good listener whenever the Great Man felt the urge . His book about his brother is not really a biography . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Hemingway 's letters , it adds some warm flesh tones to the growing picture of the supersensitive he-man who did much to mold the living as well as the writing style of an era . <P> Most notable is Leicester 's account of Hemingway 's last years . The stricken Hemingway was much sicker than any one knew . He hurt from serious internal injuries suffered in his African air crashes . <P> He was plagued by cirrhosis of the liver , high blood pressure and severe mental depression . In November 1960 , he went to the Mayo Clinic , where he received 15 electroshock treatments ; in April he went back for ten more . " Temporarily he seemed more alert , less withdrawn , less depressed . " But when he was released at the end of June , his weight was down from his normal 200 to a gaunt 155 . <P> A friend drove him and his wife , Mary Welsh , to their house in Ketchum , Idaho . " He watched the road a great deal ; he was concerned about reaching each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the road , and followed their progress constantly on a large map which he carried . " About 7 o'clock two mornings after they arrived , " he took the final positive action of his life . Like a samurai who felt dishonored by the word or deed of another , Ernest felt his own body had betrayed him . Rather than allow it to betray him further , he , who had given what he once described as the gift of death to so many living creatures in his lifetime , loaded the weapon he held and then leaned forward as he placed the stock of his favorite shotgun on the floor of the foyer , and found a way to trip the cocked hammers of the gun .
