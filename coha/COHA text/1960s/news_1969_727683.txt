txt President Nixon now is approaching three choices which may reveal and perhaps determine the character of his administration . There is a widespread feeling that Mr. Nixon has made a favorable impression in his opening weeks of office . He picked a businesslike Cabinet , delivered a low-keyed inaugural , held a series of striking televized press conferences , and made a successful whirlwind tour of Europe which reassured allies and opened the road for discussions with the Soviet Union . But now come the decisions . And ? as every president since Washington has discovered  --  decisions are where the boat goes out of the safe harbor into the stormy ocean . President Nixon has promised one decision right away , whether or not to deploy the controversial Sentinel antiballistic missile system . Mr. Nixon 's announcement that he would make his decision on the week of March 10 caught Senate opponents of the Sentinel unprepared and they burst into hurried countermeasures . Then there is the second issue of Vietnam carrying many attendant foreign problems . A huge TV audience heard Mr. Nixon 's swift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notes . Washington calls it a remarkable feat , but some think it is also a risky performance . In the case of Hanoi , for example , Mr. Nixon 's reiteration that there is an " under . standing " accompanying President John son 's halt of bombing last October runs counter to vehement declarations by the North Vietnamese . They call the . United States action " unconditional . " Will Mr. Nixon now make the " appropriate response " which he threatened if the Communists do not cease their shelling of cities , and if the casualty rate of American soldiers goes up ? Mr. Nixon is keeping his options open . // *But now it 's time for Nixon decisions // Some fear his threat , though quietly uttered , will goad the Communists to display their independence . In Paris the peace talks slowed down . In Saigon , Defense Secretary Melvin R. Laird , on arrival 18 hours after a rocket barrage in the capital , declared that the enemy " must be prepared to accept the consequences . " Events are hurrying " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. Laird said . Here is situation No. 2 where events are hurrying Mr. Nixon on to decisions . Many see the administration now emerging from its original stage of taking over control into that of exercising its control . It is an inevitable process in any administration , and ultimately it is bound to bring the end of the so-called honeymoon period . Mr. Nixon 's third choice is in the political field and may be compounded of many separate issues rather than any single one . The political facts of life are already appearing along with the normal attrition of honeymoon support . More attacks come from the far right , so far , than from the Democrats . The American Conservative Union , which endorsed Mr .. Nixon in the campaign , complains of his " new found liberalism " in its organ , The Republican Battle Line . The Chicago . Tribune opposes Mr. Nixon 's advocacy of the nuclear antiproliferation treaty . Southern protests heard Some Southerners who voted for Mr. Nixon are strongly protesting applying penalties against schools which do not comply with desegregation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the national debt ceiling was defeated in the House Ways and Means Committee . The proposal was to reduce the figure , while permitting additional borrowing . Conservative Republicans lined up with Democrats against it . Mr. Nixon may not make his political " choice " just yet in the sense of disclosing the tone of his administration . But he has a real problem . He was elected by a small majority with a Democratic Congress . This pushes him toward a middle-road course with concessions to Democrats . Some local GOP leaders complain of lack of patronage and object to taking the Post Office out of politics . The South gave Mr. Nixon the votes he needed for election but he also needs the blacks in big cities . Postelection attrition is normal and some is beginning . On the whole , Mr. Nixon has handled the transition deftly , it is felt . Old-timers admire the way he quickly cut his losses in the appointment and swift resigna tion of Willie Mae Rogers of GoOd Housekeeping as a White House consumer adviser . Some scars left Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairman Ray C. Bliss , by Rep. Rogers C. B. Morton of Maryland . This came after the intrusion of Murray Chotiner , the . California lawyer who guided Nixon campaigns through 1952 , and later became involved in a federal conflict-of-interest investigation . Mr. Morton is well liked and Mr. Chotiner now appears to be out of the picture so far as the GOP headquarters go . Mr. Nixon 's first big clash is likely to be over ABM . Mr. Nixon may avert it by deciding not to deploy the Sentinel antimissiles , which seems unlikely . A duel between President Nixon and Sen. Edward M. Kennedy ( D ) of Massachusetts on the issue may be shaping . Opponents of . the . ABM will denounce its cost and alleged ineffectiveness . The administration appears to be pushing the argument that the U.S. will lose its bargaining credibility with Russia if it does not show it is ready for deployment . Words will be relatively mild at this stage of the debate . But for the first time Mr. Nixon 's craft is going over the bar out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
