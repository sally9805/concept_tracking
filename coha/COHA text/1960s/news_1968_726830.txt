txt The members of the 1968 Legislature will convene tomorrow , facing the unpleasant election-year prospect of a lengthy session and a request from Governor Rockefeller for an increase in taxes . As the Assemblymen and Senators trickled into the Capitol today to the hum of vacuum cleaners and the thud of prefiled bills being dumped in the document rooms , Assembly Speaker Anthony J. Travia pre-dicted : " I ca n't see how we can get out of here before the early part of June ? or later . " The issue that will probably tie up the politically divided Legislature long65t will be the Governor 's budget , which is expected to call for tax increases of about $500-million . Legislators do not like to consider tax increases even in nonelection years , so the task will be particularly distasteful in 1968 , when all of them must face a reckoning with the voters at the polls . Taxes will not be the only sticky problem the 191st session of the Legislature must grapple with . A partial agenda of the major issues includes : liberalization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts of the state constitution defeated by the voters last November , aid to parochial schools , increased aid to public schools , pay increases for state employes , cutback of Medicaid ( possibly tied to passage of the Governor 's proposal for a compulsory health insurance program ) , expansion of lottery outlets , Mr. Rockefeller 's program for urban development and expansion of nuclear electric power , crime and gun laws . " It 's the toughest year the Legislature ever had , " the Governor said in a recent interview , " in terms of demands on the legislators for money and their resistance to taxes . There are pressures from both sides . It 's not going to be easy for r them , particularly since this is an election year . " Governor to Stress Taxes Mr. Rockefeller has left the legislators little doubt that his 10th annual " State of the State " message will tell them that they must raise taxes . The message will be carried live on television as he delivers it to a joint session of the Legislature at ' 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has , been sounding the tax th nne for weeks , both at a series of " town meetings " arranged ? by hiS : office and in other public appearances . For example , in an austere report to the people last weekend , an unusual appearance that was carried on all the television stations in the state , Mr. Rockefeller said : " . . Any funds for additional state aid will have to come from additional state taxes . This is the problem . Nobody wants to pay any . more taxes . Nobody wants to recommend any more taxes . But : nothing is free . And if the people want services , then tax revenue must pay for them . " One person who will not be in the Assembly chamber to hear the Governor 's message tomorrow is the - Senate 's Republican Majority leader : Earl W. Brydges of Niagara Falls , who is in a Buffalo hospital recoverfrom  --  a .. urinary infection . Mr. ' Brydges said he was feeling better and ; expected to be at his desk next week . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fiesk today , characteristically , full of energy . ' Travia Stays ' Charged ' Asked if he felt ready for the long 1968 session after having worked almost year-round at the 1967 session and the ? onstitutional Convention , the Brooklyn Democrat laughed ? and said : " I 'm never uncharged . I 've been charged all year and I stayed that way . " This is the third straight year that the Legislature . has been politically divided , with Republicans controlling the Senate and Democrats dominating the Assembly . What makes the possibility of a long session even more likely is that the leaders  --  Mr. Brydges and Mr. Travia  --  appear to be in sterner partisan moods than in past years , making compromises a little harder to achieve . Mr. Travia , who was president of the Constitutional Convention , suffered a personal setback when the proposed constitution was ' , turned down decisively by the , voters on Nov. 7 . His attitude ' now.toWard Mr. Brydges may be influenced ? by the fact that the Republican leader led the campaign against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a proponent of short legislative sessions , but he is also known to be tired of having both Mr. Travia and the Republican Governor disagree with him . Mr. Travia and Mr. Rockefeller , despite their party differences , have often seen eye-to-eye in the past on social legislation . Should Mr. Brydges take a rigid stand against the Rockefeller-Travia combination in 1968 , this , too , could add to the length of the session . Recent Sessions Long Even without some of the sticky Issues facing the 1968 Legislature , other sessions in recent years have run ' extremely long . The 1965 session did not end until June 23 . In 1966 , it was July 6 . Last year , it wound up reasonably early , on April 2 , but that was not a completely voluntary adjournment ; the legislators had to vacate the Capitol so that the Constitutional Convention delegates could move In on April 4 . Normally the Assembly would have 150 members ( 80 Democrats , 70 Republicans ) and the ' Senate would have 57 ( 31 Re-1 publicans , 26 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Asembly and one in the Senate . The Senate vacancy and two of the three in the Assembly were seats held by New York City Democrats who were elected to the Civil Court bench last November . The Republican vacancy in the Assembly was caused by a death . All four scats will be filled at special elections within the next two months . ** the issues thre1 will confront the legislators as they begin their work tomorrow are the following : BUDGET The present state budget , for 1967-68 , is $4.63-billion . The Governor has indicated that the budget for 1968-69 , which he must present to the Legislature by Jan. 16 , will : be well over $5-billion , with the gap between revenues and expenses somewhere around $500-million . The Legislature has until April 1 , ? the start of the state 's fiscal year , to make changes in the Governor 's proposal and come up with a final budget ? although the 1965 Legislature ran over the deadline by two weeks , forcing the state to adopt emergency fiscal procedures to meet operating expenses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there will be enough money from the normal increase in revenue from present taxes to pay for the operating expenses of the state government , but not to cover the cost of necessary aid to local governments . The biggest new cost item in state government will be pay increases for state employes , promised by the Governor . These . increases could go as high as 8 per cent . The biggest local-government item is ' - state aid " for public schools , which is now set at a maximum of $660 a pupil . The Regents have . asked that the ceiling be raised to $800 a pupil , which , would . cost the , state $115-million in the first year. -A joint legislative committee has recommended $760 and the final figure will Probably be closer to the last , if that high . " Another major budget strug. : gle , involves Medicaid , the Federal-state-local program .. to pay the medical treatment of the " medically indigent . " Recent cutbacks in Federal aid will cost the state several million dollars , if the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which allows full coverage to a family of four with a net , annual income of $6,000 . In addition , the Governor several months ago promised local governments that the state would pay them for any increases in - their Medicaid expenses next year . There Is talk now of easing the state ' and local burden by passing legislation to allow localities to set their own eligibility levels , as local conditions warrant . Mr. Rockefeller is . also advocating a program of compulsory health insurance paid for by employers and employes . This would relieve the state of about $100-milliOn a year in Medicaid costs . Business interests are bitterly opposed to the Rockefeller proposal and a hard legislative fight is expected . ABORTION Speaker Travia says that the abortion-reform bill that was killed in committee last year will be put out on the Assembly floor for a full debate and vote . The bill , opposed by the state 's Roman Catholic bishops , would broaden the present 85-year-old abortion bill , . which permits an abortion only to save the mother 's life . The reform bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as substantial risk that the mother 's physical or mental , health would be impaired by continued pregnancy . Mr. Travia said he personally was still opposed to the bill , but added : " I want to stop the inferences all over town that I 'm the guy who 's holding it up all by himself . " Most observers think that the bill , in its present liberal form , will be defeated in the Assembly , and may never even be allowed out of committee in the Senate . Nevertheless , the fight is expected to be one of the most emotional of the session , as it was last year . CONGRESSIONAL REAPPORTIONMENT Because of an order from the United States Supreme Court , the Legislature must redraw the state 's Congressional districts by March 1 to comply with the court 's one-man , onevote rulings . This redistricting is not expected to alter the present 25 to 15 Democrat advantage in the New York Congressional delegation , but it is expected to result in one of two Negro Democrats replacing white Democrats in Brooklyn , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OF CONSTITUTION Little is expected to be salvaged from the constitution that was turned down by the voters on Nov. 7 , except perhaps for some noncontroversial Sections , such as conservation , and also its most controversial provision  --  the proposed repeal of the so-called Blaine amendment , which banned aid to church-supported schools . Like abortion , this is a religiously tinged issue and will foster heated debate . Senate Majority Leader Brydges has given first priority to repeal of Blaine . But Assembly Speaker Travia has shifted his previous , similar , position to one in which he suggests that the matter receive further study , in the context of the entire schoolaid picture , before it is sent back to the voters . For the issue to get back on the ballot as a separate amendment to the State Constitution , it would have to be passed by two successively elected Legislatures . This means it could go to the voters again as soon as the fall of 1969 , and most observers think it will , despite Mr. Travia 's presently cautious position . URBAN DEVELOPMENT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the use of state grants and loans to private corporations to induce them to rehabilitate slums . Much of this can be . done by legislative action without amending the Constitution , and the Governor has said he will put the proposal before the Legislature . Mr. Rockefeller 's plan is expected to call for the creation Of an Urban Develop . ment Corporation with $50-mi1-lion in " seed money " to be passed on to the private corporations . NUCLEAR , ELECTRIC POWER The , Democratic Assembly shelved last year a Rockefeller proposal for an $8-billion expansion of nuclear electric power in the state . Under the plan , the private utilities would have had exclusive control over nuclear power and the public power sector ? that is , the State Power Authority  --  would have been restricted to its original function of developing hydroelectric power . The Democrats charged that this would have been a sellout to the private utilities and would have destroyed the traditional role of public power in acting as a yardstick to keep private power prices down . Seeking a compromise , the Governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amended his plan to give the State Power Authority a significant role in nuclear development . The compromise plan is viewed as having a good chance of passage this year . CRIME AND GUN LAWS Bills to broaden the authority of the police to shoot to kill criminals and suspects are expected to stir some of the most animated debate of the session . Some of the bills would repeal a section of the revised Penal Law that went into effect Sept. 1 , in order to restore to the police the categorical authority to use " deadly physical force " in the apprehension of all " fleeing felons , " even those who have not threaened force in the commission of a crime . Some revision of the law is considered certain to win approval . Other measures would restore capital punishment for many other types of murders in the state than are now subject to the death penalty . Since 1965 , the death penalty has been applicable only to murders of on-duty policemen and prison guards and to any murder by a criminal serving a life term . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered poor . LOTTERY EXPANSION The state lottery , which went into operation last July 1 , has fallen far below expectations , grossing less than $6-million a month compared with the state 's original forecast of $30-million ( the profits are for school aid ) . One of the reasons for this disappointing performance , the Rockefeller administration says , is the lack of ticket outlets ? currently restricted to banks . hotels , motels and governmentl offices . Moreover , on April 1 , uncler a recently passed Federal law , virtually all the banks will be barred as outlets . The Governor is expected to support a broad expansion of the types of permitted outlets , and the Legislature is expected to go alorz.
