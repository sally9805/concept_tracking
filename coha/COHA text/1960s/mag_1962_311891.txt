FRANZ KAFKA , PARABLE AND PARADOX ( 376 pp. ) - Heinz Politzer-Cornell University Press ( $6.50 ) . <P> Franz Kafka died of tuberculosis in 1924 , at the age of 41 . In crippling distrust of himself , he had published almost nothing , and he died little noted , leaving instructions to burn all his work . His closest friend disobeyed his will and published Kafka 's three unfinished novels , his letters , diaries , parables and tales . These included The Trial , The Castle and Amerika-in effect , the chief body of his work . The generation that has passed since then has been deeply marked by the friend 's good sense in preserving these records of a genius that at first seemed obscure , then mysterious , eventually dangerous and , at last , chillingly prophetic . <P> Critics of two cultures have pronounced Kafka 's novels both " pre-fascist " and " proto-Communist " Freudians have found in them classical symptoms of angst ; theologians have seen a cold and brilliant statement of Kierkegaard 's " either/or " maxim and Karl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Freud 's , his name has become an easy tag , employed by essayists and parlor annotators : Kafkaesque now suggests the small man confronted by a high and nameless menace , the humble man , anxious to cause no trouble , who finds that his heart has withered , the defeated man who wanders without hope through the streets of rotting cities . <P> The Impossibility of Crows . In the most trenchant and lucid study of Kafka yet written , Poet and German Scholar Heinz Politzer conducts a tireless search into Kafka 's style and imagery for clues that tie the emptiness of the heart to the disfigurement of the world outside . In Kafka 's dream landscapes and ghostly characters , he finds threads to the commanding theme-man 's search for an absolute from which he has become estranged by an impersonal society . <P> The fault is partly man 's own , as Kafka sees it , because the lonely life is a breeding ground for new and universal crimes : torpor , mediocrity , the avoidance of the dare of love . In The Trial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Castle , as the warder who never appears ; in Amerika , as a promise extended but never fulfilled . The bitter loneliness Kafka suffered , Politzer says , was in quest for " the hope beyond hopelessness , ' ' " the glimmer of light Kafka knew existed , but not for him . " <P> Politzer spent 20 years with his study , and that was too long . But he is perceptive in ferreting out the " perplexing parables " of Kafka 's style . Driven by visions of horror and forebodings of doom , Kafka 's great obsession was man 's alienation from himself , from other me , from the absolute . " The crows maintain . " he wrote , " that a single crow could destroy the heavens . There is no doubt of this , but it proves nothing against the heavens , for heavens simply means : the impossibility of crows . " Heavens that possess crows must stop being heavens ; laws that touch men abandon justice .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
