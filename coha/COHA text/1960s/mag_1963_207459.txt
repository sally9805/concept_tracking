When Protestants move from one town to another , the biggest factor in picking a new church is not denomination but nearness . Three-fourths of a group of Staten Island churchgoers , sampled by their local Protestant Council in New York , held no beliefs that would prevent their switching to some other Protestant denomination . Despite this evidence of doctrinal tolerance , church merger negotiations in the U.S. are being quietly balked . At least some of the opposition to church union , argues Methodist Theologian J. Robert Nelson of Oberlin College in the current Theology Today , is so " arbitrary and irresponsible " that he satirically wonders if some Dark Unseen Presence might be behind it . With a bow to C. S. Lewis ' Screwtape Letters , Nelson suggests seven ways that the Devil might have devised to block the road to union . <P> TEACH THAT " SPIRITUAL UNITY " IS ENOUGH . " Let people think that the essential unity of the church is quite unimpaired by denominational distinctions , disputes over sacraments and ministry , doctrine , liturgy , polity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of division can thus be discredited . " <P> PROMOTE FALSE REASONS FOR CHURCH UNION . " If Christians can be persuaded that the union of churches will be a virtual panacea for their ills , weaknesses , inefficiencies , disabilities and infidelities , the prospects for disillusionment are superb . " So long as some Protestant Christians " are kept from seeing any union as a mandate of their God , and regard it only as a matter of expedient defense " against numerical gains by Communists , Roman Catholics or fundamentalist sects , " there is really little to fear . " <P> INSIST THAT UNITY MEANS UNIFORMITY . " People are too shortsighted to see that no encompassing uniformity is found even within their own denominations . So they will go on resisting unity because they think their freedom to enjoy diversity will be jeopardized . " <P> DISTRACT AND COMPLICATE . In a merger , " ' catholicity ' is the main thing , claim some . No , it is ' right doctrine , ' say others . Both are inferior to ' mission , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fresh pool of spring water could more effectively cloud the issue . " <P> CONFUSE SELF-INTEREST WITH CONVICTIONS OF FAITH . Christians can be encouraged to disguise " selfishly motivated actions in theological , liturgical , or ethical dress . They will impugn the ritualism or moral laxity of another church . But to treat the matter openly on the plane of money , position , or power-well , that is asking too much of even a Christian . " <P> URGE DENOMINATIONS TO INVEST THEIR MONEY HEAVILY IN BUILDINGS . " It is self-evident that the chances of church union are in inverse proportion to the amount of money and power invested in ecclesiastical headquarters . "
