 | Bhutan : Mountain Kingdom between Tibet and India THE MAN , I was solemnly informed , had been attacked by a spirit . He burned with a painful fever until the local witch doctor , diagnosing the illness , prescribed a massage with salt and the juice of a jungle plant called majeeta . Immediately the scratches stood out : hundreds of scarlet marks covering the victim 's back , shoulders , and arms . This was a good omen . Had the scratches not appeared , the man would almost certainly have died . He could have been clawed by a rabid cat , but what cat glazes a grown man 's eyes with such fear ? No , clearly it was the work of a sounday , a spirit . This I was told by no less an authority than His Highness King Jigme Dorji Wangchuk , 33-year-old ruler of Bhutan . He had had the victim , a servant , stripped to the waist for my inspection in the ornate sitting room of the Royal Palace at Thimbu , the capital of Bhutan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leopard- and tigerskin rugs on the polished floor , carved and painted furniture , and richly painted walls . I had been a month in Bhutan , and already @#  | I was conditioned to believe in witches , ghosts , and clawing spirits . I had been warned before entering the country that in Bhutan the extraordinary is often commonplace and the unexpected happens . Ghosts and apparitions are so familiar that they give their names to valleys and districts . Black magic is a part of life . The sounday , I learned , can assume the shape of dog , jackal , pig , or even a ball of twine . The ball of twine manifestation is the most terrible . In it a man can become hopelessly entangled and die . when the author visit ( Monastery in Bumthanc : n to visit it in decades . " he recalls . " Many lamas interrupted their devotions to greet me .

I met one man , however , who did . He was a young Indian-educated schoolmaster in Bumthang ( the Plain of Spirits ) , in central Bhutan , who told me he had once been enticed by a bevy of soundays . Somehow he managed to resist their charms ? a victory for modern education . Problems Beset Fairy-tale State Bhutan , however , is not all spirits and superstition . Today it is a country suddenly in the news , caught between two powerful contending neighbors : India on the south and Chineseoccupied Tibet on the north . To the west lie the Indian protectorate of Sikkim and the Kingdom of Nepal . To the east stretches India 's province of Assam ( map , page 390 ) . * Long undisturbed in its feudal ways , Bhutan suddenly has problems . By a treaty signed at Darjeeling in 1949 , India has guaranteed the independence of its 18,000 square miles . But with Tibet 's tragic example still fresh in their minds , the estimated 700,000 Bhutanese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Bhutan is as outrageously different as it is beautiful . Small as a fairy-tale kingdom , it plays the role with medieval pageantry , a Dragon King , subjects dressed like Renaissance page boys , and castles thrust above indolent clouds . High mountain ranges and a closed door to foreigners have helped to preserve the country 's antique ways . Essentially , Bhutan is warm and hospitable ; it clings to human values and an easy , uninhibited way of living . Though the people of Bhutan have spent centuries in isolation , @#  | they accept with stolid unconcern the tales of the rare foreigner they meet . If I thought my accounts of sputniks and television were going to make me a celebrity , I was soon disillusioned . In a country that happily minds its own business , an oracle 's prediction or the birth of a yak are miracles enough . Yet Bhutan knows more of the world than it admits . Once in the Ha River Valley of western Bhutan , I met a 15-year-old schoolboy who addressed me in perfect Hindi . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answered promptly , " An electrical engineer . " This in a country where the only electric generators belong to radio stations , a sawmill or two , and the Royal Palace at Thimbu . Bhutan has no cinemas , and the only written news comes in the form of outdated Indian newspapers and old American maga-@# 388 KODACHR. , E zines . The country has no towns , no post offices , no shops worth the name . Since homesteads are widely scattered , there are few villages . The wheel , though known , is practically unused ; and yet people talk of skyscrapers and locomotives . Such is Bhutan , and I came to it one day over a forested pass filled with blinding mist . The shortest and best route into the country leads from India through Sikkim and Tibet . But since Communist Chinese occupation of Tibet , this route has become too dangerous . Travelers now use the longer southern route direct from India into Bhutan . Leeches Plague Bhutan Travelers When I arrived at Bhutan 's southern mountain barrier , the guides , servants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My party was small . In it was a Bengali named Bhanu Banerjee , a free-lance photographer and high-caste Hindu who had never ridden a horse or trekked more than a mile . But he had jumped at the chance to come , and there he was at the frontier in new jungle boots and Gurkha felt hat . " Where is Bhutan ? " his family had telegraphed when he wrote them of his plans . There was middle-aged O. P. Mathur , an Indian engineer who was then selecting a route for an automobile road that now links Bhutan 's fertile Paro River Valley with India . There was Matay , our cook and headman , a plump , jovial Bhutanese with a fiery temper . He had been to the United States and @#  | even toyed with the idea of staying there , but then he grew homesick . Nimchu , a Bhutanese Don Juan , was our Jack-of-all-trades . A splendid entertainer , he sang , cracked jokes , and called to every woman he passed . This calling of a man to a girl is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calls as Nimchu did , with a hand to his ear to catch the echo . " Women prepare , I am lord of the mountains and I own the sun . Your valley is mine , as are the fish in the streams and the animals in the forest . " " But are you a man ? " trills the woman , a distant speck in the flooded rice fields . So they called to us , and Nimchu invariably told me that they sang my praises . But I suspected the wicked glint in his eye , and Matay , with his Western manners , often looked plainly embarrassed . The first part of our route lay over densely forested Sinchula Pass , where prayer flags and flowers decorated a cairn of stones . Here in 1865 the Bhutanese and British met to sign a treaty that ended the Bhutan wars and cost the kingdom vast tracts of land . As we labored over the pass , I wondered about our British predecessors . Had they stuffed tobacco leaves in their boots or salt in their stockings to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scourge of Bhutan . Millions of them swarm in the undergrowth or drop from the trees . They bloody the horses ' eyes and noses and make them a fearful sight . I have had a leech suck away unnoticed at my chest until blood soaked my shirt from collar to waist . Bird Call Inspires a Ghost Legend At first . we encountered only trees and mountains , the peaks rising higher and higher toward the north , their monotony broken by spectacular waterfalls . In the forests stood banks of rhododendron , often festooned with moss . Orchids sparkled like jewels in the unending green . The jungle vibrated with bird song . One anonymous bird set up a strangely haunting cry that rang through the trees . In the mist it was an eerie sound . Legend can hardly be blamed for labeling it the voice of a lost soul . Often we rode through clouds of butterflies so dense that they brushed our faces . p 391 Hundreds were crushed under our horses ' hoofs . One variety I dubbed Suicide Butterfly : I saw several thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abound in Bhutan 's sky-high forests . Nimchu pointed out elephant tracks at 6,000 feet on a slope so steep it would have taxed even the legs and lungs of our sturdy mountain guides . Isolated Bhutan Forms a Buffer Between India and Communist China As remote as the fictional Shangri-La , Bhutan is awakening from the slumber of centuries . A new road links Paro Dzong to Jainti , India , and allows the first vehicles to penetrate a land where the wheel has been virtually unknown for transportation . Half the size of Indiana , the nation covers 18,000 square miles . Its Prime Minister estimates the population at 700,000 . Red Chinese troops occupy neighboring Tibet . @# Tigers have been seen high in the mountains , where they occasionally kill yaks . Deer , wild dogs , bears , and mountain sheep are a common sight . But my greatest thrill having to do with animals came later in a monastery farther north in Bhutan , where I saw the pelt of a dremo , my candidate for the abominable snowman . It was a shimmering gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said the old monk , who knew nothing of our Western expeditions for the mysterious yeti . I bought the skin and later showed it to an authority in the British Museum . Less romantically inclined than I , he identified it as the skin of a blue bear ? a rarity if not a snowman . Bhutanese themselves accept the snowman casually ? they have seen him , and he figures in their folk tales and songs . One account describes the yeti carrying off a woman and lovingly licking the soles of her feet until they become too tender for flight . The yeti has a lesser relative , the " Little Man , " a black , apelike creature that roams the forests , hooting and piling twigs into neat bundles . Still another , a Loch Ness-type monster ,  | inhabits one of Bhutan 's northern lake The King has seen it ? a great , white . fast-swimming shape . And the Prime Minister told me of a pink water animal , a cross between a piglet and an otter , that is sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calamity always follows its appearance . Once , after I had taken a chill swim in a pool near the palace in Thimbu. the King horrified me with the remark : " That 's the python pool . Quite a large creature , but harmless , I suppose . Or do you think it would attack a swimmer ? " @#  | For nights afterward , I dreamed of pythons coiling around me in a freezing pond . That trek to Thimbu taught me that Bhutan then had no roads worthy of the name . There were mule tracks , to be sure , that painstakingly climbed the mountains and plunged into the valleys . The great ridges of the Himalayas run north and south in Bhutan , cradling high valleys in their gigantic folds . Life centers in the wider valleys , where the rich earth yields two harvests a year . Distances mean nothing to the Bhutanese . Some mornings I would ask Matay or Nimchu where the next halt would be . They would point to some hill and say , " Just around the ridge . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfolding endlessly . Mountains seem to do that . They almost travel with one . The main track to Thimbu is fairly good ? until it rains . Then the surface becomes treacherously slippery , and the mules churn it to a porridge . A single cloudburst turns streams to torrents , tearing at everything and smashing house-sized rocks against pathetic log bridges ( below ) . Turbulent rivers are spanned by cantilever affairs of log and stone with turrets at either end to house toll gath-  | erers and watchmen ( page 384 ) . Even bridges that are sturdy to look at often shake underfoot . Prayer wheels stand in the turrets and prayer flags festoon the railings . Once , on a perilous stretch of pathway , calamity threatened . My horse shied at a bear-sized stone and , without warning , started to leap from the road toward a thousandfoot cliff . One of our quick-witted Bhutanese guides flung his loose robe over the horse 's eyes , and it calmed instantly . We broke our trip to Thimbu into six stages and stopped every 15 or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two or more rooms , with shuttered windows ( glass is rare in Bhutan ) , wooden platforms for beds , and wooden hobbyhorse-type cornmodes that take getting used to . Refugees Stream in From Tibet We shared one of these resthouses with a group of Tibetan refugees , some pathetically undernourished , others wounded , and most of them suffering from dysentery and infected insect bites . We were to meet hundreds of these pitiful exiles during our stay in Bhutan , and we always marveled at their courage . In another resthouse , where great rocks weighted down the wood-shingled roof and fireflies sparkled like animated sequins in the trees outside , my evening scrubdown was interrupted by female giggles . I turned to find mischievous almond eyes peeping through the cracks in a shutter . Later I saw the same beautiful girls shoulder our heavy bedding and fall in behind the horses . On the fourth day , we crossed a high moun- 395  | tain ridge into what our guides called the " dry belt , " and certainly the clouds that rush like frightened ghosts up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fir replaced tropical trees , and we reached the first settlements of white-plastered houses with their trimming of weather-blackened beams , reminiscent of the Tudor cottages in England . Here terraced fields of rice and wheat shingled the mountainsides and here stood the first dzongs , Bhutan 's combination fortresses and administrative and religious centers . Dzongs command most of Bhutan 's valleys . In architectural style they resemble the great Potala , or palace of the Dalai Lamas , at Lhasa : high whitewashed walls of earth and stone ; deep , richly ornamented windows ; and gold-plated pagodalike roofs adorned at the corners with dragon heads . If there are resident lamas , no woman may spend the night ? a rule that applies even to the Queen . Usually the dzongs include several chapels , sometimes as many as thirty , each magnificently painted and brooded over by a host of deities . I have stood enthralled in their perfumed gloom , trying to absorb the myriad detail of murals , images , and all the paraphernalia of worship . In some dzongs the images loom so large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upper shadows . Their hands could seat a man , and the murmured prayers of monks in the galleries overhead give the impression that the giants breathe and live . Bhutan 's Religion Mixes Creeds Buddhism , Hinduism , and Bon , the country 's original cult of sorcery and spirit worship , all survive in Bhutan 's religion . Fierce gods and protective deities are born of the strange alliance . A few merely represent some bandit or sorcerer deified more out of fear than respect . Being Buddhist and thus opposed to killing , Bhutanese shun the butcher 's trade . They give the job to low-caste Tibetans . Since even flies are spared , it is small wonder that dysentery is the country 's greatest killer . Most Bhutanese still take their ailments to witch doctors and monks , although two Indian-trained doctors and more than a dozen pharmacists have begun the campaign ? against disease . There are clinics at all important centers , and hospitals of a sort at Thimbu and Paro Dzong , the two biggest centers of population . But still no surgery is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delivery rooms , children continue to be born at home . Infant mortality is high . This is not to say that Bhutan is all hardship and disease . By Asian standards Bhutanese enjoy a fairly good life . They eat well , dress well , and most families own two homes one for winter in the lower valleys , another for summer higher up . Thus , depending on season , Bhutan 's settlements may be filled or deserted , and my first encounter with the forsaken off-season valleys was a shock . Cheering Sections Enliven Archery Meet We reached Thimbu on the day of a great archery contest . The King and Queen welcomed us to the village that serves as Bhutan 's capital and took us to the field , an arrow 's flight from the palace . For sheer pageantry , Bhutan 's archery meets are unbeatable ( page 394 ) . They are explosions of color and excitement , beginning with the archers in vivid traditional costumes , their processions like cascades of jewels down the emerald valleys . Then there are the cheering sections , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and coral jewelry . Each team has its own troupe of girls , whose job is to praise the home team and insult competitors . The competition began , and the dancing girls urged their favorites on : " My beautiful lord , let your arrow fly like a bird , straight to its nest . " Often " my beautiful lord " might be the ugliest of men , a fact that did not escape the rival teams ' girls . With a swishing of scarves they would taunt the unfortunate . " There is a goat in our village whose face is more handsome than yours . " At intermissions other dancers performed . Some wore flame-colored brocades and masks representing mystic birds and animals ( pages 404-5 ) ; others dressed as skeletons . They all leaped and whirled to the throb of **26;227;TOOLONG drums and the harsh blasts of two-yard-long trumpets . The King joined in the shooting and did very well , despite the dancing girls ' jibes ? even royalty is fair game at an archery contest . The Queen and her palace guests watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrasting with the medieval scene . " What exposure are you using ? " was as common a question as " What 's the score ? "  | Each team , I noticed , had brought its own witch doctor along , though apparently magic was taboo during the meet . The favored team had done well at first , but suddenly it collapsed suspiciously . What was worse , its best archer was seriously wounded : An arrow went through his neck . An uproar followed . A search was made for a rival witch doctor , and sure enough , there he was , casting spells . With the King 's approval , he was banished from the field . Coincidence or not , the favorite team immediately picked up and went on to win the contest . The wounded archer ? He walked from the field , helped draw the arrow from his own throat and , ignoring a doctor 's advice , sat down to a heavy meal of rice and pork fat . I 'm told that he survived . A few days later , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an oracle . It was in Ha Valley , a 9,000-foot-high basin southwest of Thimbu , from which a pass leads one ultimately into Tibet . Fear of the Chinese had seeped into the valley with the streams of pathetic refugees who brought chilling tales . Communist China , they said , regarded Ladakh , Nepal , Sikkim , Bhutan , and India 's North East Frontier Agency as her own ? the five fingers of her Tibetan hand . A young brother of Bhutan 's Prime Minister sent for the oracle and invited us to the solemn affair . Village headmen and officials from the near-by dzong were also present . Chondu Warns of Peril to Bhutan The evening threatened rain , and we sat in the gloom of a carved and painted Bhutanese home over bowls of saffron rice . At last the pau , or oracle , arrived . My first reaction was disappointment , for he was a shabby , middle-aged man with a high-pitched voice and an unctuous manner . But then he began to dance . He swayed and chanted to the rhythm of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew in stature . Finally the tempo quickened , his ritual reached a climax , and he became a menacing , commanding figure . He called upon Chondu , Ha Valley 's guardian deity , to take possession of his body . Then , in a deep , rasping voice , he announced Chondu 's approach . Now Chondu was possessing the pau , whose body suddenly stiffened , whose eyes bulged and lips frothed . A triumphant voice came from nowhere ? perhaps a whisper , per-@# @# @# haps a shriek , I was beyond remembering : " He has come ! " And no one , least of all myself , doubted . Abruptly the dancing stopped . The pau quivered so violently that the floors shook . I was as tense as the rest , as fearful as any of what was to come . When the pau opened his mouth , it was Chondu who prophesied : Bhutan was in danger . Enemies could come from the north in the spring . But there was hope . With the right ceremonies and steadfast faith on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was all . The same night , orders went out that ceremonies for Chondu be performed through-  | out the valley . Exhausted , we all went to bed . But days later I was to remember the order for the ceremonies and hope it had been obeyed . Bhanu and I had traveled north to the Tibetan frontier to see Chomo Lhari , Bhutan 's most famous peak , 23,997 feet high . Part of the mountain is actually in Tibet . We had seen it from a distance , from a pass between the Ha and Paro Valleys , a magnificent fluted pile of snow . " Go and have a look , " the King urged . " But I hope neither of you has heart trouble , " he added ominously . Lhendup Dorji , the Prime Minister 's American-educated younger brother and unofficial governor of Paro , bade us farewell . " I 'll probably be seeing you , " he said as we started . " I 'm building a fort up there . You 'll see it . It may not be the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our people together in a common effort . " He smiled . " Do n't get kidnaped . " On the second day we found the fort . beautiful construction job of great logs ? i shooting galleries , ornamented barracks , a heavy wooden gate with prayer flags fl tering above . Our welcome by a young B tanese sergeant in a fox-fur cap gave it a Davy Crockett-American frontier air . Tension Grips Border Outpost We spent the night a little way up the v Icy- . Bears had been rummaging around , were told , but it was n't bears that wor me ? it was the Communist Chinese . frontier was close , and we felt terribly alo despite the fine stockade behind us . The next day we clawed our way up Chekha , a pathetically small outpost cl. to the Tibetan border that was manned 18 Bhutanese militiamen . Here we reach the tree line ; above were only acres of alpi flowers , dominated by that exhibitionist t blue poppy , and wrapped in a vast silence . The slopes around us were dizzyingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the King . Bhutanese resent the title Maharaja as being a foreign one . To them their sovereign is the Druk Gvalpo , the Precious Ruler of the Dragon People . He is a handsome man , this Dragon King , soft-spoken but possessing a ready humor . " I 'm sorry my wife ca n't be here , " he greeted me . " She 's bathing the baby . " I asked if I could not see more of the country . My original permission had been limited to a few main centers , largely in western Bhutan . " Go anywhere you like , " the King answered generously . Such warmth and informality , I discovered , are typical of Bhutan 's King and his exquisite wife , Queen Ashi Kesang ( page 411 ) . During my stay he could not have been more kind , and yet he has much to preoccupy him . A rarity among Eastern rulers , Jigme Dorji Wangchuk was educated entirely in his own country . He speaks fluent English , Hindi , and Tibetan , as well as Bhutanese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | cover everything ? and his knowledge of Bhutan is encyclopedic . Compared to Bhutan 's former rulers , the present King is both a liberal and a humanitarian . As a result , he is respected rather than feared . He is the third in a hereditary line established with the help of the British in 1901 . Prior to that , Bhutan was governed by a succession of Deb Rajas , or temporal rulers , and Dharma Rajas , spiritual leaders . Jigme Dorji Wangchuk is at heart a reformer . Some of his liberality he gained KODACHROME BY DESMOND DOIG C NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC SOCIETY  | from travels in Europe , and some he owes to his gentle wife . Among the revolutionary reforms he has given Bhutan are the abolition of slavery and its corresponding caste system , the emancipation of women , and the democratization of the royalty . Death Penalty Seldom Imposed As to the latter , though the King is technically an absolute monarch , today he has an eight-man advisory council to help him . Laws originate in the 130-man National Assembly , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , village headmen , dzong officials , and the Prime Minister himself . The Assembly usually meets twice a year for my visit to Thimbu , and the members debated such controversial issues as conscription , military training for monks , and land grants for Bhutan 's Nepalese inhabitants , about a third of the population . The King has final veto power over laws , and he also has the power of death sentence . This is rarely used : Capital punishment , 407  | hotly opposed by the country 's powerful monks , is confined to traitors and murderers . Petty offenses are dealt with much as they were in prerevolutionary America . I saw several of the convicted with heavy boards around their necks , recalling the Puritan stocks . Prisoners are put to work by day but get time to visit friends . Land laws in Bhutan are generous . Nearly everyone owns land , and every village has certain rights to adjoining forests belonging to the crown . Here villagers may collect firewood and manure for their fields . Bhutan 's man-power shortage is responsible for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , may live separately for a time , each in his or her own home , because their families can not spare them from work . Marriage is a simple affair . Bride and groom merely announce their plans to the parents , and a lama may give his blessing . The choice of partners is seldom arranged . Death calls for more formality . The prayers of monks are necessary and great respect shown the dead , although this depends upon age . Corpses of children are dropped without ceremony into deep water or exposed on high ridges for vultures to devour , but adults are arranged in the fetal position ? legs drawn up , arms folded , and head tucked between the knees ? and then cremated . Last rit and even the carrying of the corpse are directed by the local astrologer . Tour Reveals Bhutan 's Other Half One day the King asked me if I would like to visit Bumthang , far to the east of Thimbu . I jumped at the offer , for it meant seeing such fabled places as Punakha , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ h boasts Bhutan 's largest dzong . It meant Tongsa Dzong , which the Queen 's sister described as " a fairy castle , perched so high on a mountain that the clouds float below it  | @# It meant Wangdu Phodrang , with its magnificent bridge , and Bumthang itself , in a valley with a reputation for ghosts and beautiful women . It took seven days to reach Bumthang , seven magic days of adventure along a track filled with ever-changing scenery . On one side of a high pass might lie tropical forest and on the other a world of alpine loveliness : a profusion of flowers and lush green grass that fattened the King 's handsome cattle . Mountain streams gurgled through painted shrines that harnessed the power to turn huge prayer wheels . Legendary giants and their consorts occupied the mountaintops above us . Mortals below ? the apple-cheeked village women ? fed us fresh yak-milk cheese amid the fields of flowers . Dwellings Boast Cowshed and Chapel We came at last to 11,000-foot-high Pele Pass , purple with blossoms . Matay , my constant companion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ridge that splits the country in a north-south line . To our east lived a people enormously different from those we had met . They spoke a different dialect ; they looked different ; and had a different style of architecture . Variety , of course , is basic to the Bhutanese , who are a mixture of origins and races . Anthropologists believe their ancestors include Mongols , a later wave of Tibetan settlers , and slaves of mixed origin captured by the Bhutanese from India . The eastern Bhutanese appeared stockier and generally darker than their western countrymen . The eastern Bhutanese employ a simpler , more obviously Tibetan style of architecture . In the west , where there is more contact with Indians and migrating Nepalese , the Bhutanese have evolved an ornate style not unlike that of Swiss chalets . Bhutanese houses generally have three stories . The ground floor serves as a stable , cowshed , and storage area . The second floor is family quarters , including the ever-present chapel , which is always the best room in the house . Attics , often open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fodder . The chapels interested me most , and I attended more than one banquet in them , the gilded deities almost brought to life by the flickering lights of candles . Murals of heaven and of hell glowed on more than one wall . During the meal , we would put aside a few 411  | grains of rice and some drops of millet wine for the gods . Tongsa was all that we hoped for . Its handsome dzong , visible for miles , rode like a splendid ship on the waves of distant mountains . Passing through the dzong 's massive gate illuminated with religious texts , we abruptly entered another world . Here were banks of painted galleries , with latticed windows and casements rising in multicolored tiers . Wooden roofs and gilded spires of the dzong towered above all and seemed to challenge the mountains themselves . The endless murmur of monks at prayer , punctuated by the tinkle of bells , vied with the flutter and swish of pigeons ' wings . Magenta-robed lamas leaned over the carved railings to watch us as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ages , and in a way we were , for Tongsa has changed little since its founding centuries ago . Time has slept in its secluded courtyards . Leopard 's Milk a Remedy for Rabies Only three or four foreigners have ever gazed on Tongsa 's wonders : the lamas in relays turning 12-foot-high prayer wheels ; the little-used royal suite with its gilded door that guards some of the royal treasure ; and the unchanged dzong itself ( page 399 ) . One event marred the tranquillity of our stay in Tongsa . A rabid dog bit two women and a man in the village . The nearest doctor was in distant Thimbu , but the patients were treated with a standard remedy ? a brew of leopard 's milk or the dried breast of a leopard , chicken fat , and a tuft of hair from the rabid dog . Maybe the victims recovered . I never learned . That night in our guesthouse we were de-@# lighted to receive a gramophone and six records , a loan from an official in the dzonz The bearer of the gift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ records to some lama . and they broke them all , " he said sadly . The six records comprised a Nepalese song in praise of Tenzing Norkey , the Mount Everest hero , a broken Hindi disc of 19 : vintage , three Tibetan works that consisted mainly of weird wheezing noises , and marches by massed military bands at the Aldershot Tattoo in 1933 . Where the latter came from , I shall never know , but it fitted into the repertoire very well . It was scarcely  | dinguishable from the chants , clangs , oomphs , and ahs of Tibetan lama music . Throughout our tour , I was impressed once more by the self-sufficiency of the Bhutanese. he average people care little for luxury ; they raise their own food , weave their own cloth , and build their own houses , often with barely more than their hands for tools . Money still means little to the Bhutanese , for theirs is a barter economy . The result is that the dzongs , which serve as tax-collection centers , are crammed with homespun cloth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of - rancid butter . The United States is not the my country plagued by a farm surplus ! Trade with Tibet , once an avenue for excess food , closed down with the Chinese invasion . Today the Bhutanese Government is hard pressed to buy up surplus food grains that formerly brought in Tibetan wool . Bhutan 's only real source of cash is the annual $105,000 subsidy from India , a tradition dating back to the treaty with Great Britain in 1865 . The government is wary of any other aid , fearing an end to its closed door policy . One exception is Bhutan 's ambitious road-building scheme , which India has begun financing . Early this year the King and Prime Minister of Bhutan visited New Delhi for talks  | with India 's Prime Minister , Mr. Jawaharlal Nehru , and Indian Government officials . Bhutan agreed to accept aid from India for a more extensive development program . At the same time , the King reiterated his country 's friendship for India and promised a cold shoulder to Communist overtures for aid and to the opening of diplomatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Bhutan 's total budget goes to defense . Once content with a force of half-trained territorials , the country is rushing plans for a small , hardhitting army of regulars , perhaps numbering 2,500 men . A new conscription law applies to all males between the ages of 18 and 50 . To foreigners , Bhutan 's diversely uniformed frontier garrison might seem pathetic beside Communist China 's millions of battlehardened troops . But they overlook the fact that Bhutan defends terrain where invading units would have to advance in single file and live off some of the world 's most inhospitable country . What counts is that Bhutanese militiamen know their land , can live off it indefinitely , and have a frontiersman 's skill with the rifle . Siege Tactics Recall Middle Ages Since Bhutan allows no military men among its few foreign visitors , Indian-trained Bhutanese are organizing the new army . One of the projects is construction of an army cantonment in a valley to the north of Wangdu Phodrang in the Sankosh Valley . Originally the camp was to have been in Wangdu itself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change . A handsome , decaying dzong commands the heights of Wangdu Phodrang , but the place is more interesting for its ancient bridge of stone and stout logs that spans a river 120 yards wide ( pages 384 and 408 ) . Still it stands , a monument to the engineering genius of its long-dead builders . Defense and siege are nothing new to Wangdu Phodrang . Over saffron rice and parched wheat , an official of the dzong told me tales of battles between warring chieftains 415 that included all the medieval stratagems from flaming oil and ponderous catapults to scaling ladders and blazing arrows . Bhutanese today , however , search the skies not for flaming arrows but for a new kind of airborne evil spirit ? foreign planes and possible parachutists . More than one unidentified aircraft has flown over the country in the recent past . Bhutan Links Itself Closely With India India 's friendship has probably saved Bhutan from the fate of Tibet , but India must be careful what it does . One clause in the Darjeeling treaty of 1949 reads : " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internal affairs of Bhutan . On its part , the Government of Bhutan agrees to be guided by the advice of the Government of India in regard to its external relations . " So far that advice is best characterized by the counsel of Mr. Nehru on a visit to Bhutan : " Take things slowly and keep foreigners out , even Indians , " he said . But world events have badly shaken the old Eastern philosophy of taking things slowly , and Bhutan 's days of tranquil isolation are slipping away . Times of wishful thinking are gone . Tibet , as it was known , is dead . Bhutan , possibly next on the list of Chinese expansionist aims , has chosen alliance with India , and its southern barriers are coming down .

Or worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alert and ruthless enemies . Either way , the country I have been privileged to see will die a little or completely . And only a few who have seen the virgin Bhutan ? Bhutan the contented , the uncluttered and untouched ? will know what the world has lost . Fluttering Prayer Flags Banish Demons From a Bhutanese Trail Inscribed with Buddhist prayers and sacred texts , the flags appease the gods and bring the donors good luck .
