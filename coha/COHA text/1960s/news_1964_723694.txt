txt Workers putting up bridge supports in the Thames River in the heart of London last August came across an ancient Roman barge mired in the river bed . It was covered with a thick crust of mud and slime , accumulated over 17 centuries . An official of W. E. Zimmie , Inc. , of Cleveland , an industrial cleaning firm , heard of the find and saw a chance to make a dramatic demonstration of a special chemical his firm markets . He contributed samples of the product which helped remove the mud without damaging the aged timbers and made the relic fit for display . Salvaged Roman barges do n't offer much of a market for developers of chemicals and devices designed to combat mud . But such products are finding growing demand among steel , chemical and power producers and other industries using vast quantities of water from streams and rivers . Plain mud poses a costly problem for industry because silt collects in cooling systems , steam condensers and other equipment that uses water , speeding corrosion and reducing efficiency . While this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ official conservatively estimates that mud costs steel makers $1. for every ton of metal they produce or more than $100 million a year . New Compounds To reduce costs and maintenance headaches from mud , many firms are turning to new cleaning compounds such as the chemical used to clean the Roman barge . This organic chemical , trade-named Zimmite , was developed by the Zimmie firm in cooperation with American Cyanamid Co. ; it 's designed to change mud from a sticky mass into a powdery substance that can readily be washed away . Zimmite is used to clean out the - mud that finds its way into the bottoms of Great Lakes ships along with water used as ballast . Boland &; Cornelius of Cleveland , which manages the Great Lakes fleet of American Steamship Co. , pumps the chemical into the ballast tanks along with the water . During the voyage the rolling of the ship mixes the chemical with the mud in the tanks and when the water is pumped out the mud goes too , instead of settling and caking . An official of Boland &; Cornelius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tanks clean for cargo has increased cargo capacity of the 15 ships his firm operates by about 300,000 tons a year . Before it adopted the chemical process the company relied on workmen to periodically shovel and hose mud out of the tanks . Zimmite is also finding growing use in steel mills , oil refineries and power companies . Sales last year totaled 195,000 pounds , including 40,000 pounds overseas , up from 15,000 pounds in 1960 . Helping U.S. Steel Calgon Corp . of Pittsburgh last year introduced Hagatreat 550 , a compound that it claims works roughly the same as Zimmite . U.S. Steel Corp . ' s plant in Youngstown , Ohio , has n't had to shut down its cooling system for cleaning since it started using Hagatreat in it six months ago . Previously mud deposits had to be scraped off the cooling equipment about every two weeks . A German-made device which cleans clogged steam condenser tubes by shooting balls of sponge rubber through them has been marketed in the U.S. since 1958 by Amertap Corp . of New York . Condensers are used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it can be recirculated ; the tubes carry river water through the condenser to convert the steam by cooling it . With the Amertap device the rubber balls are injected into the tubes and carried along by the normal flow of water while the condenser is operating . The balls are caught in a strainer at the outflow side and recirculated as long as needed . Pennsylvania Electric Co. , Johnstown , Pa. , installed one Amertap unit in 1961 and three more last summer at a cost of $80,000 each . The utility estimates it 's saving about $60,000 a year on each unit in improved condenser efficiency , elimination of equipment shutdowns and lower coal bills , because less pressure is needed to operate the condensers . The Permutit division of Pfaudler Permutit , Inc. , Rochester , N.Y. , has developed a filter device that cleans itself , for use in such equipment as cooling systems . The unit contains a sand filtration bed that catches dirt in water flowing through it . As dirt builds up in the bed , water starts to back up ; when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point the device automatically reverses the water flow by syphon action . The collected dirt is sucked out of the filter and pours out the unit through a backwash pipe . Between 1955 and 1959 Permutit sold only 40 of these units . But since then sales have averaged 40 a year , the company says .
