ULLMANN.PHILIP PARK ... ) g. 34 Letters to The Times Cigarette Tax Protested Losses by Retailers to Areas Beyond City Limits Seen To TILE EDITOR OF TILE NEW YORK TIMES : Your April 5 editorial " The Albany Rubber Stamp " on the one hand condemns our executive and legislative leaders for haste and lack of " bona fide thinking " in granting Mayor Wagner his requests for increased taxes . On the other hand you casually state that , part of this tax package , the " occupancy tax and cigarette tax , are both acceptable , although they cer-1 tainly do New York business no good . " How can the cigarette tax be " acceptable " if it will harm thousands of small independent retailers who depend on cigarettes for a livelihood , and will result in a more than 50 per cent sales tax on this one commodity ? Your criticism of haste and lack of responsibility on the part of the Governor and Legislature is equally attributable to you by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ termed the cigarette tax " acceptable . " Cigarette sales alone constitute from 30 per cent to 60 per cent of the total gross business volume of sonic 45,000 tobacco retailers in New York City . These same tobacco retailers lost 25 per cent of their cigar business from 1959 to 1961 due to bootlegging from neighboring states when the 15 per cent state cigar tax was in effect . These same tobacco retailers , many thousands of whom sell newspapers , lost millions of dollars during the recent prolonged news blackout . They now stand to lose countless millions more if a 2 cents per package cigarette tax increase is enacted . A differential of 40 cents a carton in favor of Nassau , Westchester and other counties and Connecticut , together with a 20 cents a carton differential for New Jersey will drive a very substantial amount of cigarette and other allied business outside New York City , An increase of the New York City cigarette tax to 4 cents a package on top of the 5 cents state and 8 cents Federal tax will total 17 cents a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 50 per cent . When government officials are so callous in placing so heavy a tax burden on one single commodity , it is time we called a halt . Or do we need another Boston Tea Party ? Ivincol.m L.

Occupancy Tax Assailed To TUE EtwasioizTiu : NEW YORK TIMES : I want to protest most vigorously against the increase of up to 5 per cent:in the occupancy tax on commercial dwellings , which The Times editorial " The Albany Rubber Stamp " finds " acceptable . " More and more small shopkeepers , many of whom find it increasingly difficult to conduct business because of continuously soaring rentals in addition to other rising costs , are being forced out of business , as the numerous available stores in even the most desirable locations will testify . To many a shopkeeper , struggling to pay an approximate annual rental of $4,000 to $5,000 , an added tax of $200 to $250 may well be the kiss of death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1963 . Control of Exhaust Fumes TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : A law enacted last year by the New York State Legislature provides that vehicles propelled by internal combustion systems manufactured after June 30 , 1963 , be equipped with crankcase ventilating devices as a condition for registration in this state . This law is totally inadequate , The crankcase accounts for only 30 per cent of the hydrocarbon emissions of ordinary cars , buses and trucks , while 65 per cent of such emissions comes from the exhaust pipe ( 100 per cent in the case of diesel engines ) , Exhaust pipe devices are not required by the present law , Such devices exist , but according to the State Air Pollution Control Board they have not been sufficiently tested . These devices , even if only 50 per cent efficient , would , in conjunction with the crankcase devices , reduce the total hydrocarbon emission by over 60 per cent ( in the case of non-diesel , vehicles ) , The present law , moreover , permits buses , cars and trucks manufactured prior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our air with 100 per cent efficiency .

With all deference to Prof. William J. Moore letter published Western edition April 5 , International edition April 8 I support , the view of The Times in doubting Professor Moore 's view that " for Mao , at least , ideology and power are one . " For the practical purposes of our China policy , I believe we should regard them as two , not one , Speaking as a near-lifetime resident in China , I very much doubt that Peking places the importance Professor Moore does upon " preserving orthodox Marxist-Leninist ideology . " Is not the very essence of Communism that material facts determine ideology ? I suggest that both in Russia and China the " orthodoxy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that both countries will continue to " use " varying interpretations of ideology to suit the practical exigencies of their differing national needs . Even the basic strategy whereby Communism was introduced into China was " heresy " in Stalin 's eyes , Revision of ideology Communism in China exploded out of the decadent realities of Chinese life . It gained body from China 's basic peasant ills . Nationalism and economics will , in China as in Russia , impregnate ideological Communism and twist its dogmas to practical convenience . Moreover , the ancient character of . Chinese culture will impose its stamp upon a borrowed foreign ideology  --  being used as it is as a means , not an end -- for its needed moral and physical disciplines : disciplines designed to lift swiftly a quarter of the earth 's people from the fearful degradation of centuries of subsistence living . Thus , the predominant role of Communism in China is to serve the Chinese revolution aimed at . internal modernization ; not to facilitate Chinese imperialism , nor to threaten the security of America , and certainly not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American people can , properly and safely , be with tile proper desire of the Chinese people to modernize themselves ; relegating to second place futile obsessions with theories pf Communism .

The United Slates did violate the Geneva agreements by blocking free elections in North and South Vietnam and by subsea quent military activities in the country .

In World War I , during an allnight forced march to our jump-off position in the Battle of the MeuseArgonne , many of our doughboys , to lighten their burden , threw away their two bandoliers of caliber-30 rifle ammunition and their picks and shovels .
